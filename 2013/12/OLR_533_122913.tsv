7000	14000	Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Happy New Year! Well, Happy New Year to those of you listening to this in 2014. Tonight, we're still a few days away, and that means we still have to close out the year. Take a look back with us as we reminisce about 2013, and take your comments and calls on this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	40000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to the very last episode of Orange Lounge Radio. For the year 2013!
40000	42000	Troll-old!
42000	47000	Oh, why not? Travis was doing that joke last night on Understation Live. I thought I'd continue it tonight. Anyway, hi!
47000	49000	What do you think of it? We did it last year, too.
49000	65000	We probably do it every year, but anyway, no, we're not going anywhere anytime soon, but the calendar is a-changin'. Welcome, everybody, to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio for this December the 29th of 2013, episode number 533 of our show.
65000	70000	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me, as you already heard, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
70000	72000	I'm gonna finish this dang puzzle.
72000	74000	What are you playing right now?
74000	81000	I'm playing Mii Plaza so I can get puzzle pieces since a certain somebody who also has this puzzle completed came in.
81000	95000	Those puzzles, yes. That is kind of like my little crack addiction on the 3DS, like when I'm not playing a 3DS game or whatever. I like to do the little street passing, collecting the puzzles. You know what's really great for that now is Starbucks.
95000	98000	Oh yeah, I go to at least three different Starbucks a week now.
98000	100000	And you get like six people at a time now.
100000	102000	Also, I'm gonna steal Alan. Thank you.
102000	112000	Alan, by the way, just since it's not video, Alan brought some wine in for our celebratory last episode of the year. Thank you, Alan. We'll see Alan in Part B a little later.
112000	114000	Jam jar is not bad.
114000	116000	This is okay.
116000	118000	It's not as sweet as Frivolo.
118000	120000	Sorry, listeners. I know this is not great radio, but I have wine.
120000	121000	We're having wine tasting.
121000	125000	I'm having wine, so I'm just gonna sippy here on the wine.
125000	127000	Have wine and coffee.
127000	134000	I don't know about that combination. All right, but anyway, while we sip away here on some wine, why don't we say hello via Skype? Say hello to Loki, everybody.
134000	135000	Hi.
135000	137000	Hey, Loki. How you doing?
137000	144000	I was doing pretty good until how many games I bought during the Steam sale. Not so much anymore.
144000	150000	We were talking before the show a little bit, right after, between the Bobby call and then when we went live.
150000	159000	You were asking us, how do you look up how much I've spent on the Steam sale? So you must have found it, and you sound really depressed now.
159000	166000	Well, I didn't buy all of these, because I got a couple gifted, but I have 30 new games.
166000	169000	Oh my god, that you just picked up during the sale?
169000	171000	Yes.
171000	175000	Wow. And out of those 30, Loki, how many have you actually played?
176000	188000	A few, actually. I have played a few. But, see, here's the thing. Not all of them were from the Steam sale. Actually, there was one that was part of an indie bundle, and so, I mean, seven of those were...
188000	195000	I think, actually, the amount of money that I've spent, though, has been quite small, I mean, for 30 games.
195000	198000	So you tend to buy the stuff that's like two bucks?
198000	199000	Yeah.
199000	205000	That makes sense. I don't blame you. Well, have you played any of the 30 games that you've actually bought?
205000	206000	Yes, I have.
206000	209000	And what was your favorite out of what you've played so far?
209000	211000	The Stanley Parable was pretty good.
211000	220000	Yes, it is. Okay, did you get the two special endings? Where you go visit the other places?
220000	224000	Yeah, I got that ending. I've gotten all the endings, I think.
224000	226000	Don't spoil y'all, because I stopped to play it.
226000	233000	I'm about, I think, four away from beating from all of them, but you also get really random ones, too, so...
233000	235000	Yeah.
235000	244000	Well, Loki, the sale is through January 3rd. Are you gonna try to restrain yourself now, or is it still open season and you're gonna buy a bunch of stuff?
244000	247000	Well, here's the thing. I'm right now thinking of things to actually buy.
247000	250000	I really want. That's the thing.
250000	261000	Well, yeah, just as said in our chat room just now, because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blocko Show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
261000	268000	And 5th Dream in chat says, new sale is up, Loki. Get crackin'. That's right. It's 6 o'clock, so they just flipped over, so...
268000	271000	And for anyone who's interested, I'm opening Normandy.
271000	273000	And that's your Animal Crossing town, right?
273000	274000	Yes.
274000	281000	Has Duke Nukem gone up yet? I've seen it up for a vote, but I haven't seen it actually on sale yet, and I really want it on sale.
281000	286000	Um, I thought it was part of one of the Flash sales, but I don't remember.
286000	291000	It might have been one of the ones I missed. If so, I'm gonna be really irked, because that's one of the games I wanted to get.
291000	301000	But, Loki, thank you again for the $20 gift card you got me for the holidays. I used that to buy a bunch of trading cards and level myself up to 20.
301000	307000	But then I crafted that badge for the snow season, or whatever, the snow winter sale badge.
307000	312000	And I got an item in there that I sold for like 75 cents, so that paid for like 5 of the cards right there.
312000	322000	Yeah, the items I got were crap, so I ended up just selling all of them, because it was like, ooh, hey, a football manager background. Yeah, totally awesome.
322000	325000	Some addicting crap, though, all that stuff.
325000	329000	Yeah, I got some good stuff on Steam, so I'll talk a little more about that later.
329000	334000	Ooh, I'm looking, it looks like the Flash sale right now. Stanley Parable, funny enough, you guys talk about that.
334000	338000	And Bioshock Infinite, which I'm gonna talk about a little later, because I finally played it this week.
338000	339000	I need to play that.
339000	347000	Alright, but before we get to that talk, we also have to introduce here with us in studio, say hello to the voice of the show joining us over the season.
347000	351000	I guess this, it's been about three months now, or will be, by the time you're...
351000	352000	It sure feels like it.
352000	357000	But we love having you here. Even though, you know, we've always kind of been three people, it's fun to mix things up a little while.
357000	361000	And you do great, and you have a great voice. So we always love having here in the studio, Jason, everybody.
361000	362000	That's me.
362000	363000	How you doing?
363000	366000	I'm, uh, still in a bit of a rush, and I'm trying to get my heart rate back down.
366000	370000	Jason literally walked through the door as we were playing the opening song tonight.
370000	376000	Uh, maybe a little bit before, but what's your excuse, young man? You were in the Bay Area.
376000	381000	What's your excuse, young man? You have a curfew of 6 PM, and you got here at 6, don't you?
381000	382000	No, I...
382000	385000	Don't ever be a co-host on Hoard House, because you will get emails like that.
385000	397000	I, uh, went to a Raiders game, versus Broncos in my defense. I went to a Raiders game with a co-worker of mine, and, uh, despite leaving early traffic and everything else, I just...
397000	401000	I timed it perfectly well, actually, all things considered.
401000	403000	So you did make it here.
403000	404000	I did make it here.
404000	408000	I'm sorry you had to suffer through watching the Raiders play. That's, uh, that's unfortunate.
408000	414000	It was, um, it's actually my first ever, uh, game that I've been to in a stadium, football-wise.
414000	420000	I've never been to... I've been... I went to the Mile High Stadium as a kid, but for a concert, uh, teenager.
420000	426000	Um, but I don't think I've ever seen a football game, high school, college, like anything, in a venue before.
426000	433000	So, it was nice to see. It was a good reminder to find out how hectic things are, especially in the Bay Area.
433000	436000	It was fun. It was really interesting. It was really good being able to get out there and do that again.
436000	438000	You didn't get shot, or shot at.
438000	446000	Uh, one of them, definitely not. The second one, well, there's a lot of bangs in the arena, but I don't think it was somebody firing a gun.
446000	450000	Uh, go to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. BlackWolf says,
450000	452000	Jason's excuse is identical to mine. That's right.
452000	453000	Football.
453000	457000	Yeah, he plays in the football drumline in Atlanta, so, uh, exciting stuff.
457000	460000	He says he did the show tonight in his uniform. That's how last minute it was.
460000	463000	I was like, why don't you have a webcam, Bobby? That'd be hilarious.
463000	467000	You know, you and I have seen our share of high school football games.
467000	468000	Oh, god, yes, me and the band.
468000	475000	I went to an Alabama Auburn game, which anyone from Alabama, any part of the south will know how big the college football thing is.
475000	478000	I fell asleep. I was so bored.
478000	482000	Uh, let's see, go into the chatroom as well at live.vognetwork.com.
482000	488000	Mako asks some questions about Duke Nukem, saying, wait, Duke Nukem forever? Are you nuts?
488000	492000	I just want to clarify. Duke Nukem 3D.
492000	499000	If I said forever, then I obviously overly misspoke, and what a faux pas. Duke Nukem 3D is what I'm waiting for.
499000	503000	That was also my very first convention land game.
503000	504000	Nice.
504000	508000	Was Duke Nukem 3D, when you could do the voice macros and everything. That was awesome.
508000	512000	I'm sure I've told this story on the show before, but we used to play that in the college dorms, like, over the dial-up.
512000	517000	Because, you know, all those little rooms, I mean, dorm rooms are tiny, right? But we'd all have our own phone number.
517000	523000	So, I would play in my room, and then my best friend who lived next door to me would play Duke Nukem in his room.
523000	525000	And we would call each other over the phone and do that.
525000	532000	And the bros in the dorm loved it, because they would, like, see where I'm at, and then, like, go run and tell him where I'm at, and then they'd run it over.
532000	535000	Talk about screen-lookers. Come on, that's just straight-up cheating.
535000	541000	I know, what a bunch of gossipy bitches. Like, you don't think brosy straight guys can be gossipy bitches?
541000	546000	Get Duke Nukem. Get Call of Duty in the mix, and we all understand that.
547000	549000	No offense, but offense.
550000	555000	I played... man, what were my early dial-up days? I remember a lot of Warcraft II.
555000	562000	I know I played Shadow Warrior once or twice with a friend of mine. I feel like we had to have played Duke Nukem.
562000	568000	There... some game of its ilk at the time. There was definitely another first-person shooter I played a couple times.
568000	571000	For the life of me, I can't remember what it was.
572000	577000	Tigerclaw in the chat room reminding us, I got Duke Nukem 3D when Good Old Games gave it away.
577000	582000	God bless Good Old Games for giving that away. I actually got that too, so I'm very thankful about that.
582000	586000	The reason why I also want it on Steam, but I want to get it on sale when it's only, like, three bucks,
586000	590000	is because they have that multiplayer coming, which, you know, the Good Old Games one is great,
590000	595000	but it doesn't, like, they're trying to add to it for the Steam one, so that's what I'm trying to get in on.
595000	603000	So, actually, clue me in on this, um, have we... has Duke Nukem multiplayer on PC not been a thing at all yet?
603000	608000	Like, in, of course, the modern remakes, DOSBox emulation, that kind of stuff.
608000	610000	Well, you should still be able to land it.
610000	613000	Because, like, Loki, do you know?
613000	615000	It's just not easy.
615000	617000	Yeah, this is not easy. It's not what he used to be.
617000	620000	I think, I mean, I don't know, I haven't messed with it.
620000	623000	This dream says Duke Nukem gossipy bitches edition.
623000	626000	I was going to say that I played a Duke match not long ago, but now that I think about it,
626000	629000	that was probably on Xbox 360 after I picked that up.
629000	631000	Oh, yeah, that was on.
631000	636000	And, yeah, I guess, I guess games of those time were built for, like, IPX and NetBIOS
636000	641000	and all of this other ridiculous out-of-date nonsense that predates, you know,
641000	645000	LAN parties in the stable way that they are now.
645000	649000	Well, as exciting as it is to talk about a 20-year-old game here on the program...
649000	650000	And 28-8 bod motives.
650000	654000	Hey, we love our retro games. That's, you know, part of what we're all about.
654000	659000	But I want to kick off tonight with the topic that I'm sure a lot of your favorite podcasts
659000	662000	and websites and so forth are getting into on this slow news week
662000	665000	because it is a bit of a slow news week, you know.
665000	668000	We had a pretty major holiday happen this past week
668000	671000	and, you know, things that people are celebrating, a lot of people traveling.
671000	673000	So there was not a lot of gaming news this week.
673000	675000	We'll get to what there is in a moment,
675000	680000	but this is the time of year where a lot of people talk about what was your top games of the year.
680000	683000	So I want to start that same conversation here at Orange Launch Radio,
683000	685000	the top video games of 2013.
685000	688000	But a very important difference, what we're trying to do here.
688000	692000	Here at Orange Launch Radio, we want to talk about our, or as the case may be,
692000	697000	your favorite games of 2013, meaning there are no right or wrong answers.
697000	701000	We're not trying to say, this is the list and shut the hell up.
701000	705000	We'll do that later in list list because that is where we do the scientific list and the way things are.
705000	709000	But for this, this is just about, hey, these were my favorite
709000	711000	and so there's no right or wrong answers.
711000	714000	So I just want to know, like, what were your favorite games of the year?
714000	716000	Chatters, if you want to play along, shout them out in the chat room.
716000	720000	Your one, two, and three, what were your top three games of 2013?
720000	724000	And to be honest, guys, they didn't have to be released in 2013.
724000	729000	They could be any time if it was something you really got into this year
729000	732000	that made 2013 for you.
732000	736000	So how about ladies first, just because I'm dying to know for DarkSakura,
736000	738000	her top three games of the year.
738000	741000	DarkSakura, what was your number three pick and why?
741000	743000	My number three?
745000	748000	I don't even know if it actually came out this year, but I'm going to say fractal anyway.
748000	750000	Fractal anyway?
750000	754000	Fractal, make blooms not war, because that has been my crack.
754000	757000	If ever, and I'll tell you, and I mentioned this before,
757000	761000	if ever I need something to distract myself that will make my mind work,
761000	764000	especially work on a pattern, it's fractal.
764000	768000	And I love the game. I am super hooked on it.
768000	772000	And I, yeah, fractal. Fractal, make blooms not war.
772000	776000	That is actually a game I got into a little bit when you sent that to me.
776000	779000	I did play a pretty good amount of time one night.
779000	782000	It was a really kind of different puzzle.
782000	786000	It reminds me of the old school games of life that were on the Commodore 64,
786000	789000	and I'm not talking about the board game version with the wheel in the car with the pegs.
789000	794000	I'm talking about, like, this dot will survive if surrounded by other dots,
794000	796000	but not too many, then it will die.
796000	799000	And you just see these really very pretty patterns that bloom from that.
799000	802000	It was almost like that idea, like as a puzzler, was really cool.
802000	805000	Well, especially with the ambient music that plays in the background,
805000	811000	it's, I'm trying to think of the right way to phrase it.
811000	813000	Yeah, that's it.
814000	818000	This game is actually from 2010, believe it or not,
818000	822000	but it was offered as parts of bundles in 2012 and 2013,
822000	825000	so it kind of came to more prevalence later.
825000	828000	Well, then I'll tell you what, I have a different game that came out this year.
828000	830000	And that's Legend of Zelda Link Between Worlds.
830000	831000	Ah, okay.
831000	836000	Because it's fun, and I still haven't gotten past the second boss in the dungeon
836000	839000	because that one is always the one that got me in Link to the Past.
839000	843000	But it's really fun, I love it, and the 3D makes me completely motion sick.
843000	845000	So that will be my number three.
845000	847000	But the 3D is really good, I gotta say.
847000	849000	It is, but it still makes me motion sick.
849000	850000	So I don't use it that often.
850000	852000	It's actually very disorienting, especially when you're,
852000	858000	I love the switch in perspective when you jump from a higher plane to a lower plane.
858000	862000	Because the camera actually moves with you just a little bit.
862000	865000	But otherwise, you know, I've been completely enjoying it.
865000	868000	That game is definitely on my list.
868000	870000	Alright. Excellent.
870000	872000	Because I want to stick with stuff that came out this year.
872000	874000	Okay, fair enough.
874000	877000	Loki, what's your number three pick?
877000	884000	My number three pick is going to be probably, it's kind of a toss-up.
884000	886000	It almost sounds like a three-way tie for number three.
886000	889000	We'll have a time to talk about honorable mentions later.
889000	890000	Okay, so let's see.
890000	895000	I'll probably do, since I was gonna go by how long I played games,
895000	899000	but let's do Saints Row IV, actually.
899000	904000	Just because it was, you know, I like Saints Row, but it was a little bit of a disappointment
904000	907000	just because it seemed like it was kind of rushed.
907000	909000	But I still enjoyed it.
909000	916000	It's just, you know, it's frustrating that it, I know it, having played all of the entire series,
916000	918000	I know how good it could be.
918000	921000	And it's disappointing to see that it didn't quite make it there,
921000	925000	mainly to where Saints Row II and III would have been.
925000	929000	It had potential, so hopefully the next Saints Row that comes out will be much better,
929000	931000	but yeah, it's still pretty good.
931000	936000	Alright. And you did talk an awful lot about that game, all the good and the bad,
936000	939000	so it doesn't surprise me at all that that is in your top three.
939000	943000	Jason, I don't know if you were wanting to do this tonight.
943000	946000	I know you tend to play a lot more of the phone games and the classics,
946000	948000	but do you have three games from this year?
948000	952000	Based off going, like, the only way I can really gauge it is going based off the kind of things
952000	956000	that I've been talking about a lot, and I think I've come up with a one, two, and three.
956000	957000	Okay.
957000	962000	So, number three, I'm going to give to FTL, Faster Than the Light,
962000	967000	because I've not had, like, despite how much I complain about that game,
967000	970000	if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be playing it.
970000	975000	And it's, you know, it's not particularly puzzly, it's kind of Twitch action
975000	981000	because it's overriding theme more than anything else is management of individuals,
981000	985000	because the pathfinding, yeah, whatever, the attacking isn't exactly,
985000	989000	you can drill down and make things a little bit more difficult
989000	993000	and a little bit more complicated and directed,
993000	998000	but it's just a good, I don't even want to call it a god sim,
998000	1003000	it's really hard to pin down, but it's just a satisfying,
1003000	1008000	nearly mindless, but not if you don't want it to be kind of adventure game.
1008000	1010000	You know, I need to check this game out.
1010000	1012000	This is one of those games I've always been meaning to check out,
1012000	1014000	especially because it's sort of like a roguelike,
1014000	1018000	but just to be clear, this game was released in September of 2012,
1018000	1021000	but it doesn't, well, it really doesn't matter, because again,
1021000	1024000	like, how many games, and you know, it's so funny,
1024000	1027000	who was it on Twitter posted their top ten?
1027000	1031000	It was, who does Twisted Metal? David Jaff? Is that his name?
1031000	1033000	Yeah, he does Twisted Metal. Loki.
1033000	1036000	Yeah, that's him. I don't know how to pronounce his last name.
1036000	1041000	He posted, like, his top ten of the year, and Sonic Racing,
1041000	1044000	the one that came out last year, technically, the one with Danica Packard,
1044000	1047000	Sonic All-Stars Adventure Racing, whatever was in his list,
1047000	1051000	and everybody was like, you idiot, that came out in 2012, boo!
1051000	1054000	But it's like, okay, but there's so many games,
1054000	1056000	like, how big is your backlog, people?
1056000	1058000	Like, there's still games, like Stanley Parable, I just said,
1058000	1060000	I need to get around to playing that still.
1060000	1063000	I need less than 25% of my Steam library, so...
1063000	1066000	Exactly. Mass Effect, I did not discover my love for until, like,
1066000	1069000	four years after the fact, so you know, these things happen,
1069000	1072000	so I just want to make very clear, we're not trying to come up with, like,
1072000	1076000	some journalistic, this is the best of the best, it's no, you're free.
1076000	1080000	These are our gaming years, and FTL definitely ranked up there quite quick.
1080000	1082000	I haven't played in a couple weeks, I need to change that.
1082000	1085000	When we get that tweet that's like, why did Jason put a 2012 game on his list?
1085000	1088000	I'm gonna go ballistic, I'm gonna say, weren't you listening?
1089000	1091000	Listen to all the other words, come on!
1091000	1093000	But you do remind me, I need to check that one out,
1093000	1095000	as old as the game may be getting at this point.
1095000	1097000	It's still quite fun, very fun.
1097000	1099000	All right, very fun. I guess just me's left, right?
1099000	1103000	Okay, my number three pick, my number three pick is Super Mario 3D World
1103000	1108000	on the Wii U, which is, god, the Mario games are damn near always,
1108000	1112000	like, rock solid games. I mean, there's a reason why people eat up
1112000	1115000	anything with Mario in the title, because, especially when it's, like,
1115000	1118000	the main series games, the platformer games, they are almost always,
1118000	1122000	without fail, some of the best games to come out for the year.
1122000	1124000	A few exceptions here and there.
1124000	1127000	But Mario 3D World is by no means an exception,
1127000	1129000	it is one of the best of the year.
1129000	1133000	I did not know how a 3D game was gonna go over on the Wii U,
1133000	1137000	because, you know, it's not in 3D, but they made it work out very well.
1137000	1143000	I love the return of the classic styles of Princess Peach and Luigi
1143000	1145000	and so forth from Super Mario 2.
1145000	1150000	I think the level design is fantastic, and especially later on,
1150000	1153000	it just gets brutal in some of the more secretive stages
1153000	1155000	that come up much later on.
1155000	1157000	The game can just be damn near brutal,
1157000	1160000	and it's an amazing amount of fun with friends as well.
1160000	1165000	It's a game that Wii U badly needed, that's gonna move some consoles,
1165000	1169000	and rightfully so. It is a must-have game on the Wii U,
1169000	1171000	and absolutely one of the best of the year.
1171000	1173000	So Mario 3D World, my number 3 pick.
1173000	1178000	Alright, let's get into, let's read some number 3s from our chat room.
1178000	1183000	Degenerate Johnny says, Dead Space 3, Code Man, Borderlands 2,
1183000	1187000	Tech 2030, Tomb Raider, let's see,
1187000	1190000	Dark Tetsuya, Unreal Tournament Game of the Year.
1190000	1193000	Found it at Goodwill over the summer and been playing the hell out of it.
1193000	1195000	That works, that works.
1195000	1198000	Alright, there you go. Let's get into some number 2 picks.
1198000	1201000	Dark Sakura, your number 2 pick.
1201000	1202000	The Stanley Parable.
1202000	1204000	The Stanley Parable.
1204000	1206000	Because that game sort of snuck up on me,
1206000	1208000	and I'll tell you how I heard about it.
1208000	1210000	It was actually through a parody.
1210000	1213000	Not really a parody, but it was a response to an email
1213000	1216000	that the game creator had about it.
1216000	1220000	And so he had the narrator narrate the response and the letter
1220000	1224000	about this guy being a major douchebag who emailed about it.
1224000	1226000	I was like, why do you say Stanley so many times?
1226000	1229000	Like, well the game is about Stanley and you'll blah, blah, blah.
1229000	1230000	So anyway.
1230000	1233000	So once I saw that I was like, okay, I have to play this game.
1233000	1235000	So I downloaded it.
1235000	1237000	I paid full price for it on Steam at the time.
1237000	1238000	It was worth it.
1238000	1243000	I've totally enjoyed it and I try to sparse out my playing through it
1243000	1247000	because honestly I still get really motion sick with first person games.
1247000	1253000	But I really just enjoyed the really bizarre sense of humor
1253000	1255000	that went into making it and I love the narrator.
1255000	1259000	I just sort of, you know, tried to do stuff now to spite the narrator.
1259000	1261000	And it's so fun.
1261000	1263000	So the Stanley parable gets my number two.
1263000	1267000	When you have like a little sarcastic antagonist slash protagonist
1267000	1270000	slash do I root for this bad guy or not type character
1270000	1272000	like you had in Portal for sure.
1272000	1275000	I notice you tend to love those types as a lot of people do.
1275000	1277000	So that doesn't surprise me at all.
1277000	1281000	I like games that are mockeries of other things.
1281000	1284000	I love, I'm a big fan of satire.
1284000	1288000	And it seems to me that a great deal, I mean, well, hello, I like Homestuck.
1288000	1294000	But I mean I like anything that is both a satire and homage to a genre.
1294000	1297000	So I've been having a good time with the Stanley parable.
1297000	1300000	And I think that it's something that if you haven't played yet
1300000	1302000	you definitely need to play it.
1302000	1304000	Act Definitely in our chat room saying playing the Stanley parable
1304000	1306000	makes me kind of anxious.
1306000	1307000	But it's so good.
1307000	1308000	It really is good.
1308000	1309000	It's such a great game.
1309000	1313000	And that and I just want to send a message to
1313000	1317000	we should get the narrator from the Stanley parable to do a bumper for us.
1317000	1319000	If they would, I would love that.
1319000	1321000	That would be amazing for the VoG network.
1321000	1325000	OrangeZoundsRadio asked me to do a bumper and I said, well, sure.
1325000	1327000	Excellent, excellent.
1327000	1329000	Who's up next? How about Loki?
1329000	1331000	Loki, what's your number two pick?
1331000	1334000	My number two is going to be Bioshock Infinite.
1334000	1340000	It was a great game and had a lot of moments in it
1340000	1344000	where it was just very awe-inspiring, I guess.
1344000	1350000	And the ending was, it was very satisfying, I guess.
1350000	1353000	So definitely Bioshock Infinite for number two.
1353000	1356000	I like games that have moments.
1356000	1358000	The very beginning, I mean, you don't even have to wait that long.
1358000	1361000	Just, you know, within like the first two minutes it's just like,
1361000	1364000	whoa, that's pretty powerful.
1364000	1367000	Well, I didn't want to get into my gaming week too much.
1367000	1368000	I was going to say this for a little later,
1368000	1371000	but I will say I did finally jump in and play Bioshock Infinite
1371000	1373000	for the first time this week.
1373000	1375000	I was lucky enough to get it as a gift on Steam and I was like,
1375000	1378000	all right, it's about frickin' time I finally played this game.
1378000	1383000	And I was blown away by the graphics.
1383000	1391000	They are so good and the atmosphere of the Columbia is fantastic.
1391000	1393000	Like, you know, I played the first Bioshock and I was like,
1393000	1396000	oh, this is all right and I see why people are into it.
1396000	1398000	You know, the more the story unfolded and so forth.
1398000	1402000	But this one just, not to be crass, but it had me by the balls
1402000	1403000	from the very beginning.
1403000	1409000	It was so good and the way the environment is
1409000	1412000	and all the things to look at and the story behind it.
1412000	1415000	Like, Dioshock, I think if you could handle the first person shooter,
1415000	1417000	I mean, it's unfortunate, you know, you have the sickness,
1417000	1419000	but I think you'd be really into this too because there's so much of the lore.
1419000	1421000	I do have the sickness.
1421000	1423000	The lore and the culture with it.
1423000	1425000	No, I know I want to play it.
1425000	1428000	I have it. I've had it for a while.
1428000	1431000	So I definitely want to. It's just...
1431000	1434000	And there's some very uncomfortable things.
1434000	1436000	I know some of you guys have probably heard about the controversies
1436000	1437000	in the game and so forth.
1437000	1439000	There's some very uncomfortable things in there about America's history.
1439000	1440000	I'm from Alabama. I can deal with it.
1440000	1448000	I know, but it's done in a very tasteful way for a story
1448000	1451000	that pushes it forward without it being, like, shocking,
1451000	1453000	if that makes sense.
1453000	1454000	It is shocking.
1454000	1456000	It seemed really realistic to me.
1456000	1459000	I mean, if you've ever looked at any photos from America's history,
1459000	1463000	or even not just America, but, you know, other places in the world,
1463000	1467000	it's something that it's very period-specific.
1467000	1469000	So, unfortunately, it didn't make my top three,
1469000	1471000	probably because I got into it too late in the year,
1471000	1473000	but it would definitely be one of my honorable mentions
1473000	1475000	of a late ad to my list.
1475000	1477000	But anyway, Loki, not to derail what you were saying,
1477000	1480000	but it's just I had to get that out there that I played it this week,
1480000	1483000	and I was just so in love with it.
1483000	1484000	It's great.
1486000	1488000	Okay. All right.
1488000	1490000	Do you have anything to add, Loki?
1490000	1491000	Nope.
1491000	1493000	All right, then Jason, we'll go to you.
1493000	1495000	Jason, what is your number two pick?
1495000	1498000	Continuing my trend of playing catch-up,
1498000	1504000	it was recently revealed to me that Borderlands 2 was 2012.
1504000	1507000	Fabulous powers weren't revealed to you the day you held off your sword?
1507000	1509000	I just don't remember that day.
1509000	1510000	I don't remember being at the store.
1510000	1512000	I don't remember where in the year it actually fell.
1512000	1513000	All the DLC was this year.
1513000	1515000	Yeah, and that's actually what I'm basing this off of,
1515000	1518000	is that I made a point a couple of episodes ago
1518000	1521000	back when the PS4 was coming out,
1521000	1524000	or just after the Xbox One was out, one of the two close enough together.
1524000	1528000	At any rate, one of the things that's been really interesting to me
1528000	1531000	is that because online is ubiquitous everywhere,
1531000	1536000	we are truly starting to see video game communities in the video game
1536000	1540000	and not fan forums and that kind of stuff
1540000	1543000	that has a very serious disconnect from the game.
1543000	1547000	I keep wanting to say Bioshock, because we were going on and on about that,
1547000	1548000	and I want to play that too,
1548000	1553000	because Borderlands is multiplayer and has a lot of work put into it
1553000	1556000	to make sure that the experience of playing together is good,
1556000	1559000	not to mention the randomness of the loot and the DLC
1559000	1562000	and the keys that SHiFT gives out
1562000	1565000	and everything else that's going into that game.
1565000	1567000	There are a lot of video game communities,
1567000	1573000	but Borderlands 2 is the first one that I know of that's console-specific
1573000	1578000	that's putting in a lot of work into maintaining original content
1578000	1580000	and the health of that community at large.
1580000	1583000	Funny enough, you are not the only one to put in that game from last year.
1583000	1587000	At your number two, I see Seattle in chat says his number two pick
1587000	1588000	is Borderlands 2 as well.
1588000	1589000	Long distance high five.
1589000	1591000	There you go. Awesome.
1591000	1599000	My number two pick is a game you've heard me talk a lot about on this program,
1599000	1600000	but with good reason,
1600000	1603000	because it is absolutely one of the best of the year,
1603000	1604000	if not the past few years.
1604000	1605000	The Lich King.
1605000	1606000	No, close.
1606000	1610000	Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn is my number two pick for game of the year.
1610000	1616000	Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 was one of the most awful MMOs ever made.
1616000	1617000	That is no secret.
1617000	1620000	The fact that they were able to bring in a new producer
1620000	1622000	who has worked utter magic with this,
1622000	1625000	because not only was he able to take,
1625000	1630000	not only did he make a great new MMO that was very competitive,
1630000	1634000	that had a lot of the great stuff that we love about World of Warcraft
1634000	1637000	and Guild Wars 2 and other MMOs that are out there on the market,
1637000	1639000	but kind of put the Final Fantasy brand on that
1639000	1640000	and even push it forward a little bit.
1640000	1645000	The fact that he was able to do all this and back the car into the spot,
1645000	1646000	so to speak, of,
1646000	1650000	oh, but we've got to make sure 1.0 continues into this
1650000	1652000	and the things that everybody started at 1.0 have to carry over.
1652000	1656000	That was a miracle in gaming that they did with that game.
1656000	1659000	It is gorgeous to look at, it's fun to play,
1659000	1664000	and it is probably going to be one of the best MMOs of this decade,
1664000	1665000	because if you think about it,
1665000	1668000	World of Warcraft still have a great love for that community.
1668000	1670000	I'll love that game.
1670000	1672000	I cancelled my account this week, I'm sorry to say,
1673000	1675000	because I've been paying for two MMOs.
1675000	1678000	Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn is where it's at for me right now,
1678000	1680000	and WoW is an eight-year-old game.
1680000	1681000	End of an era.
1681000	1682000	Running on that engine.
1682000	1684000	It is in a way, it is in a way.
1684000	1688000	I don't even think the new expansion is going to be enough to make me want to go back.
1688000	1691000	It's one of those, I'll check it out, but we'll see.
1691000	1695000	I'm so excited about a lot of the stuff that's going on in Realm Reborn right now,
1695000	1697000	especially with the latest patch and so forth.
1698000	1702000	I think it is kind of the end of an era just as, and to be fair,
1702000	1706000	before the angry Blizzard mob comes at me with their pitchforks and torches,
1706000	1711000	just as when I left Final Fantasy XI to go to World of Warcraft,
1711000	1712000	that was the end of an era.
1712000	1714000	This is what's next.
1714000	1717000	The pendulum has swung, and now we're on the other side.
1717000	1720000	Did I mention the soundtrack is so flipping good?
1720000	1723000	Unless you get tired of listening to the Chocobo music the whole time.
1723000	1727000	I might have actually been playing Final Fantasy XIV right before this very show tonight,
1727000	1732000	and I was running a Titan kill, which those of you that have played the game know,
1732000	1735000	you have to kill the, I'm not even talking about the level 35 one,
1735000	1737000	I'm talking about the one at level 50.
1737000	1740000	Oh my god, oh my god, look at the YouTube of the fight.
1740000	1741000	It's crazy.
1741000	1743000	And the music is like this rock song that's like,
1743000	1747000	That's like death metal that plays in the background,
1747000	1749000	and it's like, your heart is beating so fast.
1749000	1752000	I know Alan could probably hear me from the other room,
1752000	1754000	like every time I got hit with something I shouldn't have,
1754000	1758000	it's like, fuck, motherfucker, piece of shit, god damn it.
1758000	1760000	I have Tourette's or something sitting there playing this game,
1760000	1762000	but I'm just like that into it.
1762000	1764000	I was playing with a fun group of people.
1764000	1770000	Funny enough, Darlena, who's one of the hosts over on All Games of,
1770000	1772000	I'm going to mess up the name of the show, I'm so embarrassed,
1772000	1775000	Cat and Fox, I think she's one of the hosts of that show,
1775000	1779000	I was playing with in a group and we were having a lot of fun,
1779000	1783000	and I helped one of their friends get a Titan weapon, or relic plus one,
1783000	1784000	so that was good.
1784000	1787000	I was having some fun with Final Fantasy XI,
1787000	1790000	I was changing up the music because you could kind of mod it a little bit
1790000	1794000	and add your own tracks and where different songs were.
1794000	1799000	So I had Otherworld from Final Fantasy X as my fight theme the entire time,
1799000	1803000	or Smack My Bitch Up from Prodigy, depending on if it was a party or not.
1803000	1805000	And then what was it, for the Chocobo theme,
1805000	1810000	it was Falcor's music from Never Ending Story.
1810000	1812000	So that made the game even better.
1812000	1816000	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
1816000	1819000	You kept wondering what would be the WoW killer for many years,
1819000	1823000	so do you feel that Final Fantasy XIV killed it or did WoW kill itself?
1823000	1825000	I don't think WoW is dead by a long shot.
1825000	1828000	Are they hemorrhaging subscribers in a way? Yes.
1828000	1831000	But are they still the biggest MMO four times over? Absolutely.
1831000	1833000	And there's still a great community over there.
1833000	1836000	I may be finally tired of the game, so in that regard,
1836000	1841000	yes, WoW is killing itself because it's not innovating fast enough.
1841000	1844000	That's the problem, is that now everybody's sitting here going,
1844000	1847000	We are done with Pandaria, we are ready for that next expansion.
1847000	1851000	Oh, you just announced it. Oh, it's going to come out in maybe six months.
1851000	1854000	This is Blizzard's biggest problem right now,
1854000	1856000	and I don't know if it's because they're spreading themselves out
1856000	1860000	amongst five games or whatever, but they're moving too slow.
1860000	1865000	And I know Blizzard has a reputation of it will get out there when it's done,
1865000	1869000	and when we rush things, something like what happened with Diablo III will happen,
1869000	1873000	and I understand that, but you look at something like Hearthstone as well,
1873000	1877000	Hearthstone is a great game. It is moving too slow.
1877000	1880000	Why is that game still in beta? Why?
1880000	1884000	They're still balancing things, really? It is moving too slow.
1884000	1889000	It is time to open up that beta and just launch the damn game.
1889000	1893000	If you have to still balance some cards, is it really that big of an issue
1893000	1896000	because most MMOs out there still need fixing?
1896000	1899000	I think the game's in fine enough shape.
1899000	1900000	And it's not even just MMOs.
1900000	1904000	Blizzard's entire catalog is balanced once every month, basically.
1904000	1908000	And this may just be the difference that ten years makes or whatever,
1908000	1911000	where that whole mantra for Blizzard where it's like,
1911000	1913000	Oh, we'll just take time until it's right.
1913000	1916000	I'm not saying don't take the time to get it right,
1916000	1919000	but I'm saying move a little faster, you guys. I'm sorry.
1919000	1921000	That's the reality. They're not moving fast enough.
1921000	1923000	I don't think anything's changed in that regard.
1923000	1925000	I think they still can take their time,
1925000	1933000	because they have three solid IPs that are by no means close to danger.
1933000	1936000	Fair point, because does it work for Diablo? Yes.
1936000	1938000	StarCraft? Yes. Hearthstone? Yes.
1938000	1939000	A game where you're asking...
1939000	1941000	I actually wasn't counting Hearthstone.
1941000	1943000	You said it yourself. WoW is still strong.
1943000	1947000	But between WoW, Diablo, and StarCraft, they are very healthy right now.
1947000	1949000	It's strong, but it is losing steam.
1949000	1953000	And the difference there is you are asking people to pay a monthly fee for World of Warcraft.
1953000	1954000	And it's like...
1954000	1958000	And not only that, but then you nickel and dime them with the server changes,
1958000	1962000	which... I get it. Final Fantasy XIV does it too.
1962000	1964000	They make their money or whatever.
1964000	1968000	But I just think it's moving too slow.
1968000	1971000	Like, you want me to pay for eight months while I wait for an expansion?
1971000	1974000	Like, no, I'll quit, and then maybe if the expansion is good, I'll come back at that point.
1974000	1976000	That's the reality.
1976000	1979000	By which you mean you will come back for at least a month to find out.
1979000	1980000	For like a month, yeah, of course. Why not?
1980000	1981000	More than that, we'll see.
1981000	1982000	We'll see.
1982000	1986000	Alright, anyhow, moving on. Let's get to number one.
1986000	1987000	Number one!
1987000	1989000	That's right, Numero Uno.
1989000	1993000	Dark Sakura, your number one pick for Game of the Year.
1993000	1995000	Animal Crossing.
1995000	1998000	Why am I not surprised?
1998000	2001000	I've played this game, like, addictive.
2001000	2003000	It's so crazy.
2003000	2005000	I have friends that play with me.
2005000	2007000	Hayak Deft.
2007000	2010000	You may have just had your town open during this very show.
2010000	2014000	I did, and then it crashed on me, and Mr. Resetti showed up making a face at me, so whatever.
2014000	2017000	But I love Animal Crossing.
2017000	2023000	I think that they have found what works again, and it's become fun.
2023000	2028000	You know, even Dan has a character. He still lives in a tent, but he has a character in my village.
2028000	2033000	And I was thinking about it, too, that, you know, I've been using it to help Julian with his reading,
2033000	2039000	and to bribe him into paying attention to other people, but it's got appeal for all ages.
2039000	2043000	I really have been enjoying my game.
2043000	2047000	I also may have finished my wine before you did. Like, all of it.
2047000	2049000	It was really good.
2049000	2051000	Rob, wine!
2051000	2054000	No, I don't need any more, especially since I have to drive tonight.
2054000	2058000	Yeah, there's one glass limit for her. I'm just slowly sipping away at this.
2058000	2061000	We'll finish that bottle, don't worry.
2061000	2063000	Because Alan's here tonight. I don't have to pick him up.
2063000	2064000	Do you like the jam jar?
2064000	2066000	Yeah, this is good. I like this.
2066000	2067000	Because of my seal of approval.
2067000	2072000	All right, number one from Loki, as if I have to ask.
2072000	2077000	If it is not the game I'm thinking it is, I may have a heart attack and die, so let's see what happens.
2077000	2079000	Loki, your number one pick of the year.
2079000	2082000	I want you to die, so yes, it is going to be Grand Theft Auto V.
2082000	2084000	Of course! Of course!
2084000	2086000	I mean, what else would it be?
2086000	2089000	It's a great game and I love it.
2089000	2092000	And they're still making it better.
2092000	2096000	That's it. Grand Theft Auto V. Not a surprise.
2096000	2099000	And if you want to know more about why Loki picked Grand Theft Auto V as his game of the year,
2099000	2103000	just go back to the previous 15 episodes of the show or so since the game came out.
2103000	2106000	Basically? I was going to say exactly the same thing.
2107000	2110000	Jason, numero uno, number one.
2110000	2116000	If for no other reason than because of the last two weeks, definitely, certainly, completely, Rogue Legacy.
2116000	2122000	I've been having, especially with the controller now, it was always a fun game on the keyboard.
2122000	2130000	And I just kind of live for that adventure, random, twitch, roguelike, platformer,
2130000	2133000	just all things together, the music and everything else.
2133000	2135000	I've been having so much fun with that game.
2135000	2140000	Throw in a controller, I've been using the PS4 controller religiously like every day since I've started,
2140000	2143000	since I got it and actually got it to work.
2143000	2145000	It's been insane amounts of fun.
2145000	2151000	And I'm thinking that when it's out on, I'm thinking when it's out on two systems that I don't have
2151000	2158000	and one system back home that I'll get back to eventually, those being the PS Vita, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4,
2158000	2165000	I may buy it again because just to have the console experience from the ground up,
2165000	2169000	not to mention there's some very, very frustrating Mac bugs with Rogue Legacy.
2169000	2175000	But besides the point, more specifically, I've had a conversation with a friend or two in the last couple of days.
2175000	2182000	I kind of want to get a Vita for a number of reasons and that's basically PlayStation 1 classics
2182000	2187000	and some of the newer games, being able to play them portably just seems like a worthy investment.
2187000	2191000	And that's always what it is for me with consoles, rather with portables,
2191000	2196000	is that when I can play something anywhere, I love to be able to do so.
2196000	2202000	And Rogue Legacy may tip me into that purchase and so for that very reason, that's my number one pick,
2202000	2203000	hands down, of this year.
2203000	2205000	And it actually came out this year.
2205000	2206000	It sure did.
2206000	2207000	Yeah.
2207000	2210000	It sure did. No, it's a great pick. It really is.
2210000	2213000	I was listening to the show on the way up here, of course,
2213000	2216000	and I was listening to you and Bobby talking about it in the handoff.
2216000	2221000	And like anything else, it kind of has that first little hurdle.
2221000	2226000	Grinding pays off and this game doesn't stretch it out unreasonably.
2226000	2235000	But it's actually coming around a second time because I'm at a point where I like to clear the entirety of the areas.
2235000	2241000	I posted a screenshot to Steam two nights ago or something like that,
2241000	2248000	that I finally, for the first time, accessed and cleared every single room in the castle and the forest.
2248000	2253000	It is still the only time I've done that once and then I frickin' die in the tower of the third area
2253000	2256000	because things get really hard really quick.
2256000	2258000	But things are moving along.
2258000	2266000	I have retrieved every item from the Enchantress and I need to start buying them.
2266000	2268000	I'm in a good place right now.
2268000	2270000	You're way further than I am, that's for sure.
2270000	2275000	And it's just managing the upgrades and figuring out how I want to proceed from there.
2275000	2280000	And finally taking on the third boss and holding my own for more than 30 seconds.
2280000	2283000	But yeah, very fun game and so much fun.
2283000	2288000	Awesome. My number one game of the year will probably not come as a huge surprise.
2288000	2293000	And I mentioned on November 23rd, which was the day that the Xbox One came out,
2294000	2301000	I said, isn't it funny that Nintendo today released two games that are damn near contenders for the game of the year.
2301000	2305000	And sure enough, both those games released ended up in my top three.
2305000	2310000	You had Super Mario 3D World at number three and The Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Two Worlds at number one.
2310000	2313000	Because that game is my fucking game of the year.
2313000	2318000	And I think some of this is a little bit personal as well.
2318000	2323000	I know that some big outlets put it in their number one to such controversy.
2323000	2328000	But, you know, good for them because it's my number one too.
2328000	2336000	And I'm going to tell you, the way that they took one of my top five retro favorites of all time period
2336000	2344000	and brought it into not like a remake or even a reimagining, but just another story,
2344000	2347000	a chapter two in that game that you love.
2347000	2351000	But now it's got all that new technology of the current console.
2351000	2359000	Like the way that it moved seamlessly from Super Nintendo to 3DS is just, it's so right.
2359000	2361000	And it feels so great to play.
2361000	2363000	And I love some of the changes they made to it.
2363000	2368000	I know some of the things were controversial where you rent the weapons now and you can do the dungeons in any order.
2368000	2370000	But I think that's cool.
2370000	2375000	And I think it makes for, you know, a different, a more Mega Man-esque Legend of Zelda, if you will.
2375000	2379000	You know, it's something a little bit different, but it is such a fun adventure to play.
2379000	2382000	And I loved every second of it that I've played it.
2382000	2390000	And it is a Link to the Past wink for me that I loved.
2390000	2394000	And I just, yeah, a fantastic game in my game of the year.
2394000	2399000	For the record, you could actually do two of the levels in Link to the Past out of order.
2399000	2403000	Yes, but, you know, weren't they numbered?
2403000	2404000	They were.
2404000	2405000	The little crystals were numbered.
2405000	2407000	They were, but I always did five and six backwards.
2407000	2409000	I would do the water palace first.
2409000	2413000	Alright, so there it is. Those are our three games of the year.
2413000	2417000	But what about you guys? Take a look at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2417000	2420000	Locopoco says, number one, BlazBlue, Chronofantasma.
2420000	2423000	I'm a fanboy who can't put the arcade stick down.
2423000	2429000	Scottatron says, The Last of Us, hands down my game of the year, the game speaks for itself.
2429000	2433000	Tech2030 says, Tales of Celia, for sure.
2433000	2438000	I clocked in like 50 hours in that game and I'm about to go back in for a second time.
2438000	2443000	Let's see, some other number ones here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2443000	2448000	I think I got mixed in with the number twos here.
2448000	2452000	There were a bunch of people that did theirs in bulk at the start of all the games.
2452000	2453000	Yeah, that's where I got to.
2454000	2458000	Grand Theft Auto V, Degenerate Johnny says, Dark Souls.
2458000	2462000	Codeman says, Super Mario 3D World.
2462000	2465000	And Dark Tetsuya says, Super Mario 3D World.
2465000	2469000	So there's a sampling of some of the answers there in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2469000	2472000	Open forum for a minute. Honorable mentions.
2472000	2477000	Some games that didn't make your top three, but they deserve a shout out here as well.
2477000	2478000	Jamie?
2478000	2481000	I'm going to say the stupid Pokemon.
2481000	2485000	Just because it was the first ones that I actually wanted in a while.
2485000	2489000	And I'm having fun with it so far. It's cute. It's Pokemon.
2489000	2491000	I like roller skates.
2491000	2495000	I don't like that every time you accidentally bump into a chair, you sit on it.
2495000	2498000	But other than that, I'm not too frustrated with.
2498000	2501000	And I also don't like the 50,007 Pikachus.
2501000	2503000	57,000 Pikachus.
2503000	2506000	But I wanted a Pikachu. That's the one that people want.
2506000	2508000	So why not give it to them?
2508000	2512000	And then you see nothing but Pikachu for another year or so.
2512000	2514000	True. And that's all that's in the world trade.
2514000	2517000	Loki, you mentioned you were trying to decide between a few games there.
2517000	2519000	What are your honorable mentions?
2519000	2522000	Let's see. Far Cry 3, Blood Dragon.
2522000	2524000	I just bought that.
2524000	2526000	It looks pretty odd. Yeah.
2526000	2529000	I bought that too and then I was like, ah, I have to do Uplay.
2529000	2532000	Ah, I forgot about that.
2532000	2536000	And then, let's see. The Stanley Parable would probably be another one.
2537000	2540000	Um, I don't know. That's pretty much it.
2540000	2542000	Jason?
2542000	2547000	Because I couldn't find a place for it in the top three and just because it...
2547000	2551000	Despite how deep it goes, I'm kind of surprised that I bumped it into my top three.
2551000	2556000	But considering everything I've talked about, obviously Papers, Please is the honorable mention that I would have loved to put in my top three.
2556000	2559000	That's on my list and I hear so much good things about that game.
2559000	2560000	It's...
2560000	2563000	I was gifted a copy of that too by a kind person.
2563000	2566000	My Steam backlog is so big, I'm gonna cry.
2566000	2568000	Tears of joy, tears of joy.
2568000	2570000	It's a good problem to have.
2570000	2573000	I have half my library. I can't even play because I don't have Mac ports.
2573000	2576000	I have another game. Little Inferno.
2576000	2579000	You were talking a lot about that game when it first came out. I remember that.
2579000	2581000	I mean, it's worth a playthrough at least once.
2581000	2583000	The combos are hilarious.
2583000	2586000	But once you get past that, it's sort of weird.
2586000	2589000	But it was really fun. I liked it.
2589000	2591000	Oh, and Limbo.
2591000	2593000	Limbo was fun.
2593000	2596000	I just want to note for some honorable mentions I have as well.
2596000	2598000	I don't know if you have some extras, Jason.
2598000	2600000	But some honorable mentions I have as well.
2600000	2603000	I think the first half of this year was...
2603000	2607000	Usually the first half of the year is not as strong as it was this year.
2607000	2611000	But we had some great games just in the first three months of this year.
2611000	2616000	But don't forget games like Ni No Kuni was a great RPG.
2616000	2620000	As much as we have fun with Bobby Black Wolf, kind of teasing back and forth with that.
2620000	2624000	Ni No Kuni was a great RPG. Beautiful style. Beautiful soundtrack to that.
2624000	2627000	Great game. I love Ni No Kuni.
2627000	2630000	Bioshock Infinite would definitely be an honorable mention for me as well.
2630000	2632000	We just talked about that a minute ago.
2632000	2636000	Tomb Raider, which hasn't come up yet, but that game was phenomenal.
2636000	2639000	And is making a lot of people's year-end list.
2639000	2641000	And with good reason.
2641000	2643000	It was so great to finally...
2643000	2645000	You play a game like Tomb Raider and you're like,
2645000	2648000	Yes! This is the Tomb Raider I wanted to play.
2648000	2650000	Tomb Raider is definitely the most...
2650000	2652000	And it looks gorgeous.
2652000	2656000	I'm kind of excited about the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One version.
2656000	2659000	I mean, yes, it's a little weird to have a remake of a game that was just out.
2659000	2665000	But at the same time, with even more power, I'm really excited to see what they're going to pull off.
2665000	2667000	I loved Tomb Raider.
2667000	2669000	I do need to add another one on my list too.
2669000	2670000	Skullgirls.
2670000	2671000	Oh, of course.
2671000	2673000	For fighting games. That one was really fun.
2673000	2676000	Jason, any others? I didn't mean to cut you off a minute ago.
2677000	2678000	Hotline Miami.
2678000	2679000	Oh, good one.
2679000	2681000	Which I haven't put enough time into.
2681000	2683000	I just bought that for Dan because it was a dollar.
2684000	2686000	More things to throw out in the chat room here.
2686000	2688000	Let's see, some honorable mentions.
2688000	2691000	Dungeon Buster says, Metal Gear Solid Revengeance.
2691000	2692000	Tomb Raider.
2692000	2696000	Tech 2030 says, Ni No Kuni, Tomb Raider, Crysis 3, BioShock Infinite.
2696000	2698000	We're all first three months.
2698000	2699000	That was crazy.
2699000	2701000	Siaos is Pokemon XY.
2701000	2702000	Steamworld Dig.
2702000	2703000	Team Fortress 2.
2703000	2704000	There's still a lot of people.
2704000	2706000	Hey, there are still a lot of people playing that.
2706000	2707000	Awesome Unicorn.
2707000	2708000	Guacamelee.
2708000	2710000	Guacamelee is great fun.
2710000	2713000	In Dark Soccer, you mentioned you just bought that.
2713000	2716000	I did have money, but it was cheap.
2716000	2719000	I'm waiting for it to be, for when I get my PlayStation 4.
2720000	2723000	I believe that it might be Guacamelee.
2723000	2725000	What did I say? Guacamole?
2725000	2726000	Guacamelee.
2726000	2727000	Guacamelee.
2727000	2728000	Guacamelee.
2729000	2733000	Degenerate Johnny says, Shadowrun Returns and Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.
2734000	2735000	There you go.
2735000	2739000	SSJ 100 Matt, Don't Starve, Poker Night 2, Pokemon XY, and DuckTales Remastered.
2739000	2740000	Oh yeah.
2740000	2745000	DuckTales was, as much as the cut scene thing bothered me, it was still, the game was a lot of fun.
2746000	2749000	And the new level was frustratingly hard.
2749000	2750000	I have another game.
2750000	2751000	That is definitely an honorable mention.
2751000	2752000	The whole rest of that game wasn't?
2753000	2754000	Not really.
2754000	2756000	Vesuvius was crazy though.
2756000	2758000	This is because of my heart.
2760000	2761000	Namco High.
2762000	2763000	No, seriously.
2764000	2768000	It's like such a, you know me in parodies and satires and tributes and things.
2769000	2770000	I fucking love that game.
2770000	2773000	It makes me laugh every time I play it.
2773000	2777000	Just knowing the characters from the obscure Namco titles.
2778000	2783000	And the homestuck characters in it and playing as the cousin of the prince of all cosmos.
2784000	2788000	It's just so crazy that it's stupidly fun.
2788000	2793000	Not quite enough to make it into my top three but definitely has a warm fuzzy place in my heart.
2793000	2794000	Alrighty.
2795000	2796000	Alright well good discussion.
2796000	2797000	Lots of great games.
2797000	2798000	This is a very good year for games.
2798000	2805000	And on top of that you get two new consoles and I'm sure they're gonna really start to roll out some of the heavy hitters next year and the year after.
2805000	2808000	We already know that because of the delays unfortunately.
2808000	2811000	Next year is going to be a great resurgence.
2811000	2815000	I can't even say a resurgence for console gaming but that's the way that it feels.
2815000	2823000	It's like everything has kind of been, you know, the late day, the late age games have been coming in at the mid and end of the year.
2823000	2825000	Literally the end of the console life.
2825000	2826000	Right.
2826000	2830000	But next year is just gonna, there's gonna be a lot of heavy hitters really quick next year.
2830000	2831000	Oh yeah.
2831000	2834000	It's gonna be all of our poor wallets collectively.
2834000	2835000	Yes.
2835000	2838000	Well you know you have things and on Playstation 4 you have, what was that?
2838000	2842000	The Order, the one about the wolves and all that that looked really cool that they were shown at E3.
2842000	2847000	And then you have Infamous Second Son is next year as well and you know there's a lot of great stuff on Playstation.
2847000	2848000	Drive Club.
2848000	2850000	Drive Club finally coming next year.
2850000	2856000	Xbox One has the Quantum Break which will, the new Halo you know is gonna be the holiday thing next year.
2856000	2862000	Lots of great things on there as well and then you know I'm sure the current gen consoles aren't stopping either.
2862000	2864000	There's gonna be another Mass Effect.
2865000	2869000	And then of course Nintendo on Planet Nintendo where they do things Nintendo's way.
2869000	2873000	They will have Mario Kart 8 is gonna be huge.
2873000	2878000	A lot of people theorizing they'll at least tease the next Zelda if it's not out next holiday.
2878000	2881000	Smash Brothers will probably be a big holiday one for sure.
2881000	2882000	Absolutely.
2882000	2884000	And who knows what else from Planet Nintendo.
2884000	2887000	I expect that game to be more like mid year.
2887000	2890000	There's no way they're gonna make it, they're gonna take it to holiday season next year.
2890000	2891000	They got Mario Kart now.
2891000	2893000	But maybe we should say predictions for later.
2893000	2896000	Yeah perhaps. Well we do have 2014 predictions coming later.
2896000	2900000	In an old segment we call Listless coming a little later on the show tonight.
2900000	2901000	We haven't done that in a while.
2901000	2902000	So stay tuned for part B.
2902000	2907000	But for now we're gonna get into the news after we do our gaming weeks.
2907000	2910000	So stepping away from the games of the year a little bit just quickly.
2910000	2913000	What have you been playing this week? What have you been getting into?
2913000	2915000	Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?
2915000	2917000	I played some stuff.
2917000	2921000	Animal Crossing and I played some Final Fantasy 14.
2921000	2925000	And I got some of my old school friends into Final Fantasy 14.
2925000	2928000	People from my Digimon days.
2928000	2934000	And the stuff and words and other games.
2934000	2937000	I bought a bunch of games that I haven't started.
2937000	2939000	I played some Fractal.
2939000	2941000	I played some Mass Effect 3.
2941000	2942000	I played some Mass Effect 2.
2942000	2944000	Because basically I have a new computer.
2944000	2948000	Oh yeah. That was your holiday gift huh?
2948000	2951000	Not really the computer. The guts in it are new.
2951000	2953000	The case. The motherboard. The processor.
2953000	2957000	The only things that we carried over from my old computer were my graphics card.
2957000	2959000	My power supply and my hard drive.
2959000	2962000	Because I already have a 3TB external storage as well.
2962000	2969000	So my new computer is pretty hardcore for me.
2969000	2970000	It does what I want it to.
2970000	2975000	So I made sure to upgrade the games that I really wanted to play.
2975000	2977000	I've played some Skullgirls.
2977000	2983000	I reinstalled Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age and I'm working on modding them right now.
2983000	2987000	And Skyrim was in the middle of installing when I left the house.
2987000	2989000	Have fun with that.
2989000	2994000	With my new processor and everything, the installs don't take long at all.
2994000	2997000	Because first of all we have our own router.
2997000	3002000	So we get better speeds with our router and everything.
3002000	3004000	And then my computer is so fast now.
3004000	3005000	I love it.
3005000	3008000	And then Dan just took all the old guts and threw together a new computer.
3008000	3010000	Because we had the extras.
3010000	3013000	He's like, let's give this one to my mom.
3013000	3016000	So that's what he said.
3016000	3021000	So I've just been playing random things really.
3021000	3023000	And more Namco high.
3023000	3026000	Because that game is crack.
3026000	3028000	I think that's it.
3028000	3031000	Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?
3031000	3034000	Well, I bought a lot of things.
3034000	3036000	I played a few things this week.
3036000	3040000	Actually, surprisingly enough, not Grand Theft Auto 5.
3040000	3045000	And that's kind of surprising because they had their holiday thing where they had it snowing and everything.
3045000	3047000	And just didn't get a chance to play it.
3047000	3050000	It's buried under cores right now.
3050000	3056000	I did play Duke Nukem Forever.
3056000	3060000	And it was terrible, unfortunately.
3060000	3064000	It kept crashing every single level.
3064000	3066000	It would crash.
3066000	3068000	Every single level.
3068000	3071000	So after about seven levels I said, fuck it.
3071000	3074000	And I uninstalled the game. I'm done with it.
3074000	3076000	It's not good in any way.
3076000	3078000	It's just...
3078000	3080000	It's absolutely terrible.
3080000	3082000	It's not what a Duke Nukem game should be.
3082000	3084000	There's no point to it.
3084000	3088000	It seems like they're more fascinated with, hey, what kind of interactive things can we make?
3088000	3093000	Alright, cool. Look, we made all these light switches and shit you can do that you don't really need to even mess with.
3093000	3095000	And then the game's just very basic looking.
3095000	3097000	It just looks old.
3097000	3100000	I don't know how to really describe it beyond that.
3100000	3102000	Other things I played.
3102000	3106000	I played a little bit of a brand new game I bought.
3106000	3108000	Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.
3108000	3111000	Now, it's an indie game.
3111000	3113000	And it's kind of cool.
3113000	3122000	It's a cross between almost like a 32nd hero and a shooter and the Oregon Trail.
3122000	3126000	So you're in a wagon like the Oregon Trail.
3126000	3131000	And it's like, day one, you've encountered some wildlife.
3131000	3133000	You go hunting.
3133000	3136000	And so your actual wagon is just shooting out bullets.
3136000	3139000	And you have to kill these things and avoid hitting the animals and stuff.
3139000	3141000	And you collect meat that way.
3141000	3145000	It just keeps popping up different random little mini games almost.
3145000	3147000	And it's just ridiculous.
3147000	3149000	It's a lot of fun and pretty cheap.
3149000	3151000	So I played that.
3151000	3153000	I played through the Stanley Parable.
3153000	3155000	And quite a bit through that.
3155000	3159000	I think I pretty much finished the game and I've gotten most of the achievements so far.
3159000	3168000	Aside from some of the ridiculous ones like where you have to mod your date on your computer and stuff.
3169000	3178000	And then, let's see, I played a little bit of Just Cause 2 multiplayer.
3178000	3181000	A little bit more of that. That was kind of fun.
3181000	3191000	I tried Proteus, which is kind of a very retro looking 3D first person, I don't know, art game, I guess.
3191000	3193000	There's not really a point to it.
3193000	3197000	But I was just showing it to Josh because I wanted to show him a game that wasn't scary, I guess.
3198000	3200000	So he dug that a bit.
3200000	3204000	It was neat. I don't know. It's very short.
3207000	3209000	And I think actually that's it.
3209000	3213000	Alright, sounds like you definitely were dipping into some of that stuff you bought on Steam.
3213000	3215000	So you weren't wasting money.
3215000	3221000	Yeah, I was going to say real quick I was just going to run down what I picked up from Steam.
3221000	3224000	Uh oh. Well it is a 3 hour show.
3224000	3227000	It'll be quick. It's only 30 games.
3227000	3240000	Sequence, Dust and Elysian Tail, Bionic Commando, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, Don't Starve, Terraria, Left 4 Dead 2 because that was free,
3240000	3248000	Operation Flashpoint Red River, Fuel, Overlord 2, Overlord, Operation Flashpoint 2 Dragon Rising,
3248000	3257000	Clive Barker's Jericho, Damnation, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, Super Hexagon, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Rise of the Triad, the new one,
3257000	3268000	Cube, Gateways, Drastic Man Epic, Half-Life Soars, Lamalana, Blockland, Ballpoint Universe, Infinite, Retrograde,
3268000	3278000	In order to love 2D Evolution, Final Fantasy VII, The Stanley Preparable, The Orange Box, and finally, actually from last week, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior.
3278000	3280000	Geez.
3280000	3282000	That's a good haul.
3282000	3287000	And it was only 60 bucks. So averaging about 2 bucks a game.
3288000	3296000	You know what? Considering that's the price of one new Xbox One or Playstation 4 game, that's doing really well for yourself.
3296000	3301000	Hours and hours of entertainment, so why not? And supporting a lot of indie games in there too.
3301000	3307000	Alright, my gaming week will be quick because I pretty much already talked about the big new one, which is Bioshock Infinite.
3307000	3309000	If I may, I also did buy Dust.
3309000	3310000	Oh, did you?
3310000	3311000	Yes, I did.
3311000	3317000	I did also play, besides just Bioshock Infinite, I did some virtual consoling on the Wii U.
3317000	3322000	Because nobody told me that Legend of the Mystical Ninja had come out on the Wii U.
3322000	3324000	That is like, even, okay.
3324000	3329000	There's some of those games, like, I loved it when it was out on the Super Nintendo, like, originally.
3329000	3336000	And I loved the fact that, you know, you had the little towns and you had the, like, minigames you could play in the towns.
3336000	3340000	By the way, one of which, Gradius, you can play Gradius in Legend of the Mystical Ninja.
3340000	3342000	It's a scaled-down version of it, but it's there.
3342000	3344000	So, you know, I loved that game as a kid.
3344000	3349000	Playing it now in retrospect, I'm kind of like, this game was kind of derpy.
3349000	3355000	But I adore it for its derpiness and for some of the things it tried to do.
3355000	3363000	And, you know, I made a great Miiverse post that is right now the most popular post in the Legend of the Mystical Ninja community.
3363000	3368000	Which is, it was a screenshot of me playing Gradius, and I put,
3368000	3373000	Look guys, I'm playing a virtual console game inside my virtual console game.
3373000	3375000	It's Virtual Consolception Horn.
3375000	3379000	It's got, like, 25 likes, so, my Miiverse moment of fame.
3379000	3380000	It's got 25, yeah!
3380000	3383000	Yes! Or whatever it's called, so that's fun.
3383000	3384000	But yeah.
3384000	3386000	How about 55, huh?
3387000	3396000	Well, this is funny, because for the first time ever, I finally got the joke in the game where there's a quiz show game that you can play
3396000	3401000	where it asks you questions about the game in the first couple stages to see if you were paying attention.
3401000	3406000	And one of the questions is, like, how many legs does the boss have?
3406000	3411000	And the answers are none, two, and 573.
3411000	3413000	And for the longest time, you know, you think,
3413000	3416000	Oh, 573, that's silly, because that's a big number. Nothing has 573 legs.
3416000	3418000	But now looking back, you're like,
3418000	3421000	Oh! Get it?
3421000	3424000	And, yeah. Which, if you didn't know,
3424000	3425000	Thank you, Konami.
3425000	3427000	573, in Japanese.
3427000	3429000	If you abbreviate some things and kind of say a lot.
3429000	3433000	You have to kind of take some liberties, but it is konami, basically.
3433000	3435000	It'd be go, nana, mi, mitsu.
3435000	3437000	So, there you go.
3437000	3442000	But yeah, you have to take some liberties, but that's why Konami's kind of always married with the number 573.
3442000	3444000	So, there you go.
3444000	3446000	Let's see, I think that was about,
3446000	3448000	Oh, then I also played Castlevania.
3448000	3452000	Because that came out on Virtual Console a few weeks ago, and I just never picked it up until now.
3452000	3456000	And, yeah, between that, Bioshock Infinite, Final Fantasy XIV, that was a week.
3456000	3458000	So, there you go.
3458000	3460000	Last but not least, Jason, your gaming week.
3460000	3464000	Mine was pretty simple too, but I'm not nearly as expansive and elaborate as Rob's.
3464000	3467000	So, it will take probably a quarter of the time, if not less than that.
3467000	3471000	I also really like to talk, and I've been drinking, which makes me more rambly.
3471000	3473000	You chatty bitch.
3473000	3475000	Yep.
3475000	3479000	I sent out a couple more gifs right around Christmas for various members.
3479000	3483000	Ms. DDR Angel, friend of the show from many, many years ago.
3483000	3485000	Haven't heard much out of her, but I saw something on her wishlist.
3485000	3487000	Oh, I still talk to her. She's still around.
3487000	3488000	Oh, yeah.
3488000	3490000	She's on Steam, and I just added her on 3DS a couple days ago.
3490000	3493000	I don't know if she's an active listener anymore, because I think she's just kind of...
3493000	3494000	Just not in the chat.
3494000	3497000	But she does have a very neat blog called The Eco Maker.
3497000	3498000	Yes.
3498000	3503000	Do you check it out, people, because if you're into doing DIY things on the cheap?
3503000	3504000	Uh-huh.
3504000	3505000	Well, they were...
3505000	3507000	And I don't think she would mind me repeating.
3507000	3511000	They were having some hard times a few months ago, and so they were really thinking like,
3511000	3513000	you know, how can we do something shortcutting?
3513000	3516000	So, a lot of great ideas in this blog on how to do it on the cheap.
3516000	3518000	So, yeah. It's a good blog.
3518000	3519000	Anyway.
3519000	3525000	Amusingly enough, I don't even remember what I sent her, but there was something at a good deal,
3525000	3528000	and I saw that it was on her wishlist, so I jumped on it and sent it her way.
3528000	3530000	Speaking of which, she should open your present.
3530000	3531000	I should open my present.
3531000	3535000	A live unboxing. A live unpresenting.
3535000	3539000	Apparently, I'm finding out that apparently roguelikes are my favorite game,
3539000	3544000	because Loki also sent me Super Wagon Adventure, which I need to actually play at some point,
3544000	3546000	and I picked up Electronic Super Joy.
3546000	3552000	Neither of those are being roguelikes, but I cracked open Doom RL, which is the Doom roguelike.
3553000	3557000	Just kind of randomly crossed my mind this week, and I wanted to see how it's improved,
3557000	3559000	and it actually has graphics now.
3559000	3560000	Wait, Doom RL?
3560000	3561000	Doom RL.
3561000	3562000	I've never heard of this.
3562000	3563000	Doom roguelike.
3563000	3565000	It's surprisingly fun.
3565000	3568000	I'm a little sad that the levels are...
3568000	3572000	They're very roguelike instead of being very Doom-like,
3572000	3575000	and I mean that in like Classic Rogue and...
3575000	3576000	Oh, Jesus.
3576000	3577000	NetHack.
3577000	3578000	All that kind of stuff.
3578000	3580000	Very classic, very boxy, and...
3580000	3584000	Yeah, it scales down the Doom textures and plays it again, but...
3584000	3585000	I don't know.
3585000	3588000	Maybe I'll look in and see if I can make levels myself,
3588000	3593000	because it'd be pretty cool to actually put homaged, if not straight up ported, Doom worlds into Doom RL.
3593000	3598000	But obviously, considering that I just gave it number one, a lot more Rogue Legacy as well.
3598000	3602000	I think I got another 30 levels or some odd like that.
3602000	3604000	Levels basically map to how many upgrades you got,
3604000	3607000	so a good heaping helping of ours in the last week.
3608000	3613000	After I watched you streaming Super Hexagon, I tried that out for myself again,
3613000	3615000	and it's strange.
3615000	3620000	I bought it on iOS some time ago, and I'm not terrible at it on iOS,
3620000	3624000	but on a D-pad, I'm just abysmal.
3624000	3629000	My records are barely 20, 30 seconds on any level and much less on the higher ones.
3629000	3631000	No, those are really good scores.
3631000	3633000	They really are.
3633000	3637000	But I can beat 30 seconds relatively easy on iOS,
3637000	3642000	and I think it's because, for what it's worth, the D-pads on Apple laptops are very small,
3642000	3648000	and so to play them with these micro-touches doesn't work very well where on iOS
3648000	3653000	I just have to jam my finger onto one of the sides of the iPhone or iPad or what have you.
3653000	3656000	But yeah, fun reminder.
3656000	3659000	Like I said, I played that game on iOS some time ago, and it was really fun.
3659000	3665000	Super Hexagon, Rogue Legacy, Doom RL, probably something else that I don't even recall at the moment.
3665000	3667000	I feel like I talked about it last week.
3667000	3672000	Definitely the continuing rogue-like week.
3672000	3674000	That is a great week to have, as far as I'm concerned.
3674000	3675000	It absolutely is.
3675000	3677000	I love me some roguelikes.
3677000	3682000	Real quick, I forgot. I went to Golf Land this week.
3682000	3684000	Oh no.
3684000	3686000	It's sad.
3686000	3690000	I looked at DDR and was like, what have they done to you?
3690000	3694000	Yeah, it was bad. I didn't actually get to play any DDR, unfortunately.
3694000	3700000	I got to try out that Super Mario Kart arcade GP or whatever it is.
3700000	3708000	Worst idea ever is to have active commentary from some guy talking about the race.
3708000	3713000	I was like, why did they even add that? It was completely annoying the entire time.
3714000	3717000	And yeah, Golf Land is sad.
3717000	3726000	I think a lot of the arcades we used to love, it's so hard to go into them and see a sea of little kid gambling games.
3726000	3729000	The ticket-spitting games. It's just so hard to see that.
3729000	3731000	Don't get Josh addicted to those.
3733000	3734000	Nah.
3734000	3735000	Alright.
3735000	3739000	Moving on, I think we are going to get into some news, but first some quick housekeeping.
3740000	3744000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R or you can also follow us on Facebook.
3744000	3746000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
3746000	3747000	We're also on Google Plus.
3747000	3750000	Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.
3750000	3756000	We do tape live again Sunday nights at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG Network.com.
3756000	3758000	And we will be back.
3758000	3764000	I mean, we didn't end up having any time off for the holidays just because these Sundays fell on pretty good days this year.
3764000	3766000	So we will be back again next week.
3766000	3772000	Still looking at the potential of doing a roadshow in a couple weeks, which will be very exciting because we haven't done one of those in a very long time.
3772000	3773000	And I should be able to.
3773000	3775000	So this is going to be very exciting.
3775000	3786000	But unfortunately, Loki, it'll probably be right when the kid's here, but it'll work out for at least us to go hopefully hang with some of the old school friends at O-L-R and some of our friends in the Bay Area.
3786000	3788000	So it'll be a very different type of episode. It'll be fun.
3788000	3789000	Cool.
3789000	3790000	Alright.
3790000	3792000	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.
3792000	3793000	Wait, wait, wait.
3793000	3794000	I just unwrapped my present.
3794000	3795000	Oh, what'd you get?
3795000	3799000	A lot of foil, which I am now wearing as a hat. Why? Because I can.
3799000	3800000	It's very pretty.
3800000	3802000	It's very blue, flowery, something.
3802000	3803000	I want to feel cool.
3803000	3807000	I actually want to go get some more to do decoupage with it just because it's so pretty.
3807000	3812000	And then I got a ThinkGeek shirt that says, I am here because you broke something.
3812000	3816000	And that's always been true, but now that it's my full-time job, yes, please.
3816000	3817000	How appropriate.
3817000	3819000	Yeah, at the moment I saw that I was like, yeah, that's for him.
3819000	3822000	Did you try to nick it off and then on again?
3823000	3828000	Well, now I need to get one of those because I'm going to be working in tech support.
3828000	3830000	Make me a hat with this foil.
3830000	3831000	Okay.
3831000	3837000	Alright, anyhow, get that foil off my head because I can't see the news otherwise, so let's get to the news.
3837000	3839000	Loki, start us off tonight.
3839000	3844000	Alright, so usually when we report these types of stories, it's normally EA shutting down servers,
3844000	3846000	but this time around it's actually going to be Sony.
3846000	3851000	They're going to be shutting down their online servers for a few of the PlayStation 3 games that they have.
3851000	3860000	Starting off with the course, Gran Turismo 5 is going to be having their servers turned off May 20th next year,
3860000	3866000	and Resistance, the entire franchise, going down on March 28th.
3866000	3872000	Also, as of January 28th, they're going to be shutting down the online connectivity for MAG,
3872000	3880000	SOCOM Special Forces, and SOCOM Confrontation, and SOCOM Confrontation and MAG.
3880000	3884000	Those are online-only games, so if you bought those, you're fucked.
3884000	3887000	Your game is over.
3887000	3892000	I kind of get the Gran Turismo 5 because they're trying to nudge people onto Gran Turismo 6,
3892000	3899000	and I'm sure there's newer SOCOM games as well, but MAG, I kind of thought there was an audience still out there for that.
3899000	3905000	I could be wrong, but I kind of thought MAG still had a little loyal following to it because it was really about massive groups of people, right?
3906000	3910000	I guess if they're not achieving that anymore, I certainly don't have these numbers to back them up either,
3910000	3913000	and I know I was interested in the game, never actually wound up picking it up,
3913000	3921000	but a game like that, if its numbers are dwindling, if they're not able to match-make and keep the 4A,
3921000	3928000	the massive number melee going on, then why keep supporting the game? Why keep putting the time and money into it?
3928000	3934000	Robert, I always think that you should have an offline component to at least do some sort of LAN or something,
3934000	3937000	because you have something that's not just a coaster when this is done.
3937000	3942000	Right. Let's see, I'm looking here in chat and Robert M says,
3942000	3948000	I thought MAG had already shut down. Well, no, they're shutting it down January 28th, 2014.
3948000	3955000	It's just that this was actually announced some time ago in July of 2013 that they were going to shut it down.
3955000	3960000	So the news that it is shutting down is not necessarily new, but it is coming within the next few weeks.
3961000	3968000	Well, I guess folks have had six months to get used to the idea and try to sell the game second hand to an unsuspecting-
3968000	3972000	No, don't do that, that's mean, that's mean. It's the risk you take with online games.
3972000	3980000	If you think about it, even Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIV, World of Warcraft, they'll all shut down someday.
3980000	3983000	It'll be a long way away, but they'll shut down someday.
3983000	3984000	XI is still active, isn't it?
3984000	3985000	Oh yeah, very much.
3985000	3988000	And there's no time, no expectation for that to go away.
3988000	3991000	No. A game like that will be around forever, you know?
3991000	4001000	But at least something like that that's a PC game, there's a chance that someone may be able to run a third-party server or something like that after the game is shut down.
4001000	4007000	Whereas something like this that's on PlayStation 3, there's no chance for that at all. You're out of luck.
4007000	4014000	I mean, yeah, maybe you're not playing the game, but I still think that there should always be at least some sort of an offline component.
4014000	4023000	I agree with that aspect of it, if not an offline component, then a self-hosted game, a self-hosted server that you can run for nostalgia's sake.
4023000	4027000	Yeah, they did that when they shut down Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.
4027000	4028000	I wouldn't know.
4028000	4036000	Yeah, they did. They made it so that you could export your stuff and play on private servers, which is weird to see a company embrace that, but that was a really good thing, I think.
4036000	4042000	It helps aid the nostalgia and custom content and people that want to do whatever they want in the confines of their own system.
4042000	4047000	Like, what's the loss if something goes wrong? You're not liable for it anymore.
4047000	4056000	Maybe not to the letter of the law, but certainly with all practicality, this game's done. You're not affecting anybody else than the people that you invited to come play this game with you.
4056000	4068000	But for nostalgia's sake, being able to continue to play the game, revisiting old gaming memories, that would be a good thing for MMO makers to adopt and continue to do.
4069000	4088000	And considering, too, that eventually, I'm assuming, I don't know if they're going to carry on the SOCOM brand to PlayStation 4, but you might want to have some of that stuff still available to play so that people might know what SOCOM is when the PlayStation 4 version comes around.
4088000	4096000	Unless it is truly a franchise that they're going to sunset. I mean, we don't know. That could be happening.
4096000	4104000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Zon's Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, snowflake.
4104000	4108000	Well, we shall move on with some more news. Jason?
4108000	4122000	This week, Notch just left a post-Christmas dump in your New Year's wishes and dreams in claiming that despite the build-out of Minecraft, that there are currently no plans for a Minecraft on the Wii U.
4122000	4140000	Which, not to jump on a presumption in Nintendo, but considering the age of their player base, having a productive game, like everybody is astonished when they find out that somebody building something in Minecraft is absurdly young.
4140000	4151000	You know, they're seven, they're eight, maybe even younger than that. And the Wii gamepad gives you at least a little bit more flexibility than a standard controller would.
4151000	4163000	I know a lot of people that just stick their kids in front of a laptop or a desktop and let them go to work, but for something like this that's a little bit more accessible, this comes as a huge surprise to me.
4163000	4179000	Because kids that I know really seem to enjoy Minecraft, and so to not extend it, you know, there could be political reasons, there could be time and effort reasons, and there are supporting reasons and monetary reasons.
4179000	4185000	It just seems like the Wii U would be a good expansive avenue for this, and to not take them up on that.
4185000	4194000	It is so weird that they are resisting it, and it does seem political. I mean, not to be all tinfoil hat, but let's, you know, Dark Soccer did just give out some foil, so we have that part up.
4194000	4197000	It is not tinfoil, it's fake foil.
4197000	4205000	But it at least gets us halfway to these conspiracy theories. No, but for real, like, you know, a map, duh, would be great on the Wii U gamepad.
4206000	4215000	I think just having your inventory screen and the crafting on the gamepad would make for a great experience. That's part of the biggest pain in the ass of Minecraft, is having to bring up the screen.
4215000	4221000	Where was I, man? You know, I think, oh my gosh, it would make so much sense on the Wii U, so it is very disappointing.
4221000	4223000	That's why Nintendo won't do it, because it makes sense.
4223000	4231000	It's return on investment is what it is. There's just not enough systems out there, and the people that buy games are just not there.
4231000	4235000	That's a harsh reality. I wish they'd at least, if they're not going to do it on Wii U, at least look into some second screen stuff.
4235000	4238000	And maybe they will, with the PlayStation 4 and the Vita, who knows?
4238000	4241000	Or like a port to the 3DS.
4241000	4243000	Yeah, who knows? That's possible too.
4243000	4248000	Don't underestimate, though, guys, how huge Minecraft is with, like, kids. I'm always shocked.
4248000	4250000	Julian plays.
4250000	4256000	I'm always shocked at how many people I know with kids, and they're like, oh yeah, my kid plays Minecraft, and it probably needs not be said.
4256000	4258000	Not only just the kids. The whole freaking family!
4258000	4263000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, for real. But I'm just saying, like, there are a ton of people that play Minecraft.
4263000	4267000	Like, it is pretty astounding what that game's accomplished.
4267000	4275000	There's a buddy of mine that runs a private server and has, you know, Bucket and all the mods, and there's an IRC room that we congregate in,
4275000	4282000	and so he runs a plugin that bridges the conversation in Minecraft back to IRC two-way.
4282000	4286000	And this wouldn't exist on a console, of course.
4286000	4291000	But the expansiveness is what makes that game, and the game is built around expansion.
4291000	4294000	Or surviving, if you play survival, of course.
4294000	4296000	Or building stuff.
4296000	4297000	Expansion.
4297000	4298000	Like me.
4298000	4300000	Or digging holes. I get rid of stuff too.
4300000	4307000	There is an immense amount of potential now, and I think last week we talked about, like, the long tail of Nintendo.
4307000	4313000	There will not be an immediate return on investment, but it will happen because that game is popular.
4313000	4318000	That is, you know, that would be a huge title to make its way to Nintendo.
4318000	4322000	But current plans, unfortunately, ain't gonna happen for the foreseeable future.
4322000	4325000	You know, I had to really resist picking up the PlayStation 3 version, but it's like,
4325000	4329000	dude, you own it on the 360 and you own it on the PC, and how much did you really play it on the PC?
4329000	4334000	But I've had this real bug to play Minecraft lately, so, Loki, we need to get that VoG server back.
4334000	4337000	Even if I've got a front of money for it, I think that we've got to make it happen.
4337000	4340000	We can do it and you don't need a front of money for it. I just haven't gotten around.
4340000	4342000	I'll do it.
4342000	4344000	Yay! Alright, I'm excited.
4344000	4354000	It doesn't have to... Even if you bomb the server and start new and maybe, like, as a, like, easy mode monsters thing,
4354000	4357000	where, you know, there's some challenge or something against, I think that'd be great.
4357000	4365000	I backed up the server, because they brought back the server for, like, a few days and I was able to back it all up.
4365000	4369000	But, you know, it's old now compared to, you know, the updates and everything.
4369000	4373000	And also, you know, free mode gets boring after a while, because there's no real point,
4373000	4376000	especially when there's not a lot of people playing at the same time. That's why survival's kind of nice.
4376000	4377000	Yeah, yeah.
4377000	4384000	See, my favorite thing was doing all the creative stuff, was digging holes and exploring, so I didn't really care about the other stuff.
4384000	4388000	Alright, and we've got some people in chat wanting to know when that's back up, so look forward to that.
4388000	4390000	Maybe that'll be something for 2014.
4390000	4392000	But I do notice Robert M. in chat says,
4392000	4395000	I'm not planning on getting the PS3 Minecraft right now since,
4395000	4397000	A, I'm too busy with the PC version in Pocket Edition,
4397000	4400000	and to some extent, B, the sound design isn't really there yet,
4400000	4404000	with the menu making huge metallic clunks and barely being able to hear blocks being picked up.
4404000	4409000	Honestly, though, I'm going to tell you what stopped me from getting it on PlayStation 3,
4409000	4413000	is that we haven't heard what's happening with PlayStation 4 and Vita versions yet,
4413000	4419000	and I want to wait and hear that, because will my PlayStation 3, is it going to be cross-play amongst all of them?
4419000	4422000	Because if so, fine, I'll invest the money in the PlayStation 3 version right now.
4422000	4426000	But if it's not going to be cross-play and the PlayStation 4 is going to be different or whatever,
4426000	4428000	then I'll probably just wait and get it on 4.
4428000	4430000	It's going to be different on 4, I guarantee it,
4430000	4435000	because that's why right now the PlayStation 3 version is basically a port of the Xbox 360 one,
4435000	4440000	so 4 and Xbox One are going to have larger maps and probably more features.
4440000	4442000	Alright, fair enough. Well, let's move on.
4442000	4444000	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us in the news?
4444000	4446000	Well, Mass Effect stuff.
4446000	4447000	Yay!
4447000	4453000	Well, as you guys know, on November 7th, which was N7 Day,
4453000	4459000	we had a few tweets go in that showed some of the screens, not like full-on screenshots,
4459000	4464000	but you could see computers in the background with a little bit here and there for the development of the next Mass Effect game.
4464000	4474000	There was more news that came out by Aaron Flynn, who is the general manager of BioWare's Edmonton and Montreal studios,
4474000	4479000	with just a photo of the computer that says BioWare.
4480000	4483000	And they're basically saying, and the tweet basically says,
4483000	4490000	Great time playing the next Mass Effect game in Montreal. Ambitious, beautiful, fresh, but recognizable and fun.
4490000	4497000	So, and I'm, from what this is, it looks like it's just in the very early stages of level testing and design.
4497000	4499000	What a fucking tease though.
4499000	4500000	I know.
4500000	4504000	I'm so excited and scared. Literally, I am Jesse Spano.
4504000	4505000	I'm so scared.
4505000	4508000	I am Jesse Spano in that scene when it was the new Mass Effect game.
4508000	4510000	I'm so excited. I'm so scared.
4510000	4514000	But it's not going to be a Shepard story. I'm a little scared, but I'm really excited to play.
4514000	4518000	Think about it. We will get that trailer at E3.
4518000	4523000	By six months from now, we will know about this game, Dar Sacro. Yes, we will.
4523000	4524000	I know.
4524000	4529000	And it might make it for the holidays, although I kind of think spring 2015 is a little more realistic,
4529000	4531000	but you never know if they can play it now.
4531000	4533000	I'm still going to play it. I don't care.
4533000	4540000	I was very irritated with how more human-centric the last game went.
4540000	4548000	I would like to see more expansion into the other species in the Mass Effect universe, but I'll wait and see what happens.
4548000	4553000	I'm going to reserve my judgment until I've actually, you know, got it in front of me playing it.
4553000	4555000	That's how I feel.
4557000	4559000	That and it better have the same good multiplayer.
4559000	4560000	Right.
4560000	4562000	That was pretty freaking awesome.
4562000	4565000	At this point, you were talking about server shutdowns earlier in the show,
4565000	4568000	and I'm kind of surprised they haven't threatened to pull the plug on Mass Effect 3 yet,
4568000	4570000	but I'm sure there's still a lot of people that play online.
4570000	4571000	Oh, heck yeah.
4571000	4576000	But I don't know about, like, Wii U, but who knows?
4576000	4582000	It was so borked on Wii U just with the whole Genesis thing, and you didn't get all of your options.
4582000	4583000	It's just sad.
4583000	4590000	Honestly, if you're going to get it on any system, get it on the Xbox, because you can totally mod your files.
4590000	4591000	If you have to get a console and not PC.
4591000	4592000	If you have to get a console.
4592000	4595000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates,
4595000	4600000	although I have a feeling there's not going to be much, but it's a part of the show we always do.
4600000	4603000	So, Loki, how's the US look for release dates?
4603000	4604000	Nothing.
4604000	4605000	Nothing?
4605000	4606000	Nothing.
4606000	4608000	Not a damn thing coming out this week.
4608000	4612000	You know, let's travel to Japan and take a look and see if anything's coming out there.
4612000	4613000	I kind of don't think so.
4613000	4616000	I was a little slow in bringing it up here, so sorry, guys.
4616000	4619000	They still do not have PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, remember.
4619000	4620000	That is coming out later.
4620000	4629000	Okay, Mafia 2 gets a price reduction, and there's some third-party game pads on the PlayStation 3 on December 31st.
4629000	4631000	That's something, right?
4631000	4632000	How about on the Xbox 360?
4632000	4634000	Okay, nothing on the Xbox 360.
4634000	4635000	What about on the handhelds?
4635000	4637000	How about on the Vita or the 3DS?
4637000	4639000	Nothing on the Vita.
4639000	4644000	And 3DS gets Puzzle and Dragons Z.
4644000	4646000	Oh, never mind.
4646000	4649000	Those are just decorative things.
4649000	4652000	So, is Puzzle and Dragons really big on 3DS over there?
4652000	4653000	That's kind of weird.
4653000	4658000	Because I thought that I did not like the phone game at all.
4658000	4661000	But I guess I know some people that are into it, so whatever makes you happy, I guess.
4661000	4664000	It doesn't matter if there's something out there.
4664000	4666000	Someone's gonna like it and everyone else is gonna hate it.
4666000	4667000	That's true.
4667000	4670000	Yeah, I'm looking at the other systems like the PSP and so forth.
4670000	4671000	Nada nada nada.
4671000	4675000	So, nothing in Japan, really, this week except that one price reduction and some peripherals.
4675000	4676000	Dark soccer?
4676000	4678000	Jack and shit.
4678000	4679000	I figured.
4679000	4680000	For the UK.
4680000	4681000	Yep.
4681000	4682000	Nothing.
4682000	4683000	Alright.
4683000	4684000	I'm sorry.
4684000	4685000	Fuck all.
4685000	4686000	Fuck all's coming out.
4686000	4689000	You've got enough games to play right now is the moral of this story.
4689000	4690000	Steam!
4690000	4691000	Release dates.
4691000	4692000	Absolutely nothing.
4692000	4693000	Alright.
4693000	4696000	Couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
4696000	4697000	Loki.
4697000	4698000	Alright.
4698000	4705000	So, unfortunately, one of the games I was actually looking forward to next year, No
4705000	4706000	Man's Sky.
4706000	4714000	The developer, Hello Games, suffered some flood damage over the week and it took out
4714000	4718000	some of their servers and PCs and stuff like that.
4718000	4722000	Monitors, furniture, a bunch of other stuff.
4722000	4726000	I'm not sure if that necessarily, obviously that might affect some of the development
4726000	4731000	of the game but they haven't really said that anything's been delayed yet.
4731000	4734000	I'm sure they have all that stuff backed up anyways.
4734000	4738000	And then also they're saying they're not really insured for the flood damage but hopefully
4738000	4741000	they may get some sort of help from Microsoft.
4741000	4749000	I guess they're saying Phil Spencer said he might be able to look into helping them
4749000	4750000	out.
4750000	4751000	I don't know.
4751000	4752000	They'll see.
4752000	4755000	Maybe they'll do some funding stuff to recover some of the things that they had that need
4755000	4756000	to be replaced.
4756000	4759000	It kind of sucks that they didn't have flood insurance.
4759000	4764000	I'm not really sure in the area that they're at if it's prone to flooding or if this
4764000	4766000	is just some freak thing.
4766000	4767000	It sucks either way.
4767000	4772000	I mean it's really unfortunate but these mother nature events or as they call them
4772000	4777000	acts of God or whatever, these things are going to happen.
4777000	4783000	Just a solemn reminder to have an emergency plan no matter who you are, what you do, what
4783000	4788000	are you going to do if there's a fire or there's an earthquake or a tornado or whatever
4788000	4789000	it is where you live.
4789000	4791000	Always put your offices on the second floor.
4791000	4792000	Yeah, right.
4792000	4793000	Right.
4793000	4794000	So, yeah.
4794000	4796000	Well, good luck to them though.
4796000	4800000	I hope they're able to make a recovery because that No Man's Sky did look very interesting
4800000	4805000	even though for some reason it's the one game they didn't show on TV which was kind of shitty
4805000	4808000	but it was a good trailer.
4808000	4809000	Yeah.
4809000	4810000	All right.
4810000	4812000	Ray Jinder says that games are like Pokemans.
4812000	4813000	You got to get them all.
4813000	4814000	No, you don't.
4814000	4816000	You can't get them all.
4816000	4817000	You can't.
4817000	4822000	No, no, no, but you really don't need to because there are games that stink on ice.
4822000	4823000	That's very true.
4823000	4827000	We didn't talk about the worst games of the year but there's plenty of them.
4827000	4828000	What, like Aliens, Colonial Marines?
4828000	4831000	If they were worst games, I'd play them.
4831000	4832000	You don't play bad games.
4832000	4834000	I don't waste my time with bad games.
4834000	4836000	All right.
4836000	4841000	Well, I don't know if you guys heard over the holidays but all the networks online were
4841000	4843000	getting hammered.
4843000	4846000	PlayStation Network shut down for an amount of time.
4846000	4847000	Xbox Live was down.
4847000	4850000	I don't think it was down quite as long as the others but it was down for a little bit
4850000	4852000	and Nintendo got hammered as well.
4852000	4858000	And Nintendo, you know, very apologetic via their Facebook page saying the problem, the
4858000	4863000	reason why Nintendo Network went down is because the influx of Nintendo Network accounts being
4863000	4866000	created and trying to get onto the eShop.
4866000	4872000	Well, okay, when you sell a 3DS with a eShop copy of a game that a lot of people want to
4872000	4874000	play, I mean...
4874000	4875000	Translation.
4875000	4876000	Because of y'all greedy bitches.
4876000	4880000	I don't even think it's necessarily that they're greedy but it's just here we go again with
4880000	4887000	poor planning especially when it comes to network stuff and it's a bad trend for games.
4887000	4891000	Speaking of some of the worst games of the year, calling out SimCity.
4891000	4896000	Now, I personally am not calling it out because I'm going to be honest, I didn't play it but
4896000	4900000	I was hearing about a bunch of the fuckery with that game and the online servers and
4900000	4904000	everything and, you know, we all know what that game went through and they didn't expect
4904000	4907000	the influx of people they were going to have and so forth and it really made people angry
4907000	4912000	that a game that they were used to being offline kind of had to be online.
4912000	4916000	Now, maybe a little bit apples to oranges is what I'm saying there because obviously
4916000	4920000	a 3DS does not require you to be online but Nintendo certainly took strides with their
4920000	4925000	latest patch and by only bundling in the eShop version of some of these games on some of
4925000	4929000	their consoles, you know, they were kind of asking for it on Christmas Day so you kind
4929000	4933000	of look at something like this and you go, Nintendo, y'all got no one to blame but yourself.
4933000	4936000	You know, and your poor planning.
4936000	4942000	And also, I'm curious actually how many consoles they sold because, you know, if they didn't
4942000	4946000	sell that many and they couldn't, you know, handle the influx of like, you know, a couple
4946000	4950000	thousand, you know, people then I'd be a little curious.
4950000	4953000	Yeah, but it's not just the Wii U Loki, it's the 3DS.
4953000	4958000	I understand that but, you know, come on, I mean, they know how many consoles they're
4958000	4959000	putting out.
4960000	4966000	Well, anyhow, the Nintendo eShop on Nintendo 3DS was taken down and last we heard it was
4966000	4968000	supposed to be back up 4 a.m. today.
4968000	4970000	I haven't checked to see if it was back up.
4970000	4971000	I think it is.
4971000	4974000	I've seen Miiverse has been pretty active and so forth so I think things are running
4974000	4975000	again over there.
4975000	4979000	But yeah, that was not so great.
4979000	4985000	Also, kind of as a snowball effect, the Pokemon Bank was supposed to come out on December
4985000	4986000	27th.
4986000	4992000	It was out and then it got pulled with no Western launch yet announced because this
4992000	4994000	was supposed to come out here as well.
4994000	4998000	And the Pokemon Bank was the new system where you were going to be able to take Pokemon
4998000	5000000	from X and Y and put them in the cloud.
5000000	5005000	This is how you were going to be able to transfer Pokemon to future games and, you know, no
5005000	5009000	matter what system Nintendo has Pokemon out on next, you'd be able to transfer things
5009000	5010000	through the cloud.
5010000	5013000	So because of the network difficulties, they pulled the game because they wanted people
5013000	5015000	to stop trying to get the game.
5015000	5017000	It's causing too much bandwidth.
5017000	5021000	Again, you should have known when you put all this shit out at once, something like
5021000	5022000	this would happen.
5022000	5023000	So shame, shame.
5023000	5026000	But for better or worse, they did delay this a little bit.
5026000	5028000	Your Pokemon in the cloud?
5028000	5029000	Nintendo used Fly.
5029000	5031000	It wasn't very effective.
5031000	5034000	Womp, womp.
5034000	5035000	Fired!
5035000	5036000	All right.
5036000	5042000	Anyhow, if you want to try Pokemon Bank, you're supposed to be able to download until January
5042000	5049000	31st, 2014 and be able to download a 30-day trial and then it will be $5 a year.
5049000	5054000	And if you access the bank before September 30th of 2014, you'll get Celebi for free.
5054000	5055000	So there you go.
5055000	5058000	3,000 Pokemon can go in the bank and it will...
5058000	5059000	Did you say Celebi-see?
5059000	5060000	No, Celebi.
5060000	5061000	Oh.
5061000	5067000	It will work with Pokemon Black, White, Black 2, White 2 through the Poke Transporter and
5067000	5068000	X and Y.
5068000	5071000	So that's how you can get those generations in there as well and then whatever happens
5071000	5072000	next.
5072000	5073000	So there you go.
5073000	5076000	But unfortunately, we don't know when that will come out, but I'm assuming probably in
5076000	5078000	the first week of January is when they're going to push that back.
5078000	5081000	And it will probably have a very quiet launch because they don't want everybody to hit it
5081000	5082000	at once.
5082000	5087000	But once it hits the internet, open the floodgates!
5087000	5090000	Fifth Dream in chat saying the Pokemons are clogging up our clouds.
5090000	5093000	Yeah, that is kind of what happened.
5093000	5097000	It's like in Wall-E when the ship was trying to escape and it just blew through all of
5097000	5099000	the satellite data, all the satellites from it.
5099000	5100000	Right?
5101000	5105000	Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane where you know what?
5105000	5107000	You didn't have games in the cloud.
5107000	5110000	It was right in front of your damn face.
5110000	5112000	Your head was still in the cloud, but the games weren't up there.
5112000	5113000	That's right.
5113000	5116000	Maybe in this game, though, you were in the clouds.
5116000	5117000	I don't know.
5117000	5118000	Let's see.
5118000	5121000	We're going to take a trip back to the classic game of the week.
5121000	5124000	Dark Sakura's going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,
5124000	5128000	you brats should play this game or I'll kill you.
5128000	5131000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5131000	5133000	I actually picked something a little on the obscure side.
5133000	5135000	I picked Ordine.
5135000	5136000	Ordine it is.
5136000	5140000	Which was a game put out by Namco.
5140000	5145000	Basically, I'm picking up the Namco games that were featured in Namco High because some
5145000	5147000	people have no idea where the fuck these games came from.
5147000	5150000	And I've actually done some of them for classic game.
5150000	5157000	So I picked Ordine, which is basically you're in a little plane shooting shit down.
5157000	5166000	And you have characters named Yuichiro Tomari, who is a scientist and the main protagonist
5166000	5167000	and you get a red ship.
5167000	5172000	And then you get Sun Daichin, who is a Chinese assistant and the pilot of the green ship.
5172000	5175000	You get Kana Ayahara, who is Tomari's fiance.
5175000	5178000	You get Dr. Kubota, who is the main antagonist.
5178000	5184000	You get Miki-chan, who is a shopkeeper and Dream Company Limited, who is a robot who
5184000	5186000	flies around and helps you.
5186000	5188000	And basically, it's just a really cute little shooter.
5188000	5192000	You get all the usual power-ups, you know.
5192000	5197000	And the thing about this is that it came out in 1988.
5197000	5202000	So it's one of those Namco System 2 hardware games.
5202000	5205000	And it came out on PC Engine in 1989.
5205000	5209000	And it came out for the TurboGrafx in 1990.
5209000	5211000	It's in the Namco Museum Volume 4.
5211000	5215000	And it has come out on the North American Virtual Console.
5215000	5216000	So it's just a cute...
5216000	5217000	It did?
5217000	5218000	Yes, it did.
5218000	5219000	Wow.
5219000	5220000	It's just a cute little game.
5220000	5221000	I haven't played this ever.
5221000	5225000	It was actually advertised as a comical shooter.
5225000	5226000	I gotta be honest.
5226000	5228000	It looks a lot like Fantasy Zone.
5228000	5229000	A lot, a lot like Fantasy Zone.
5229000	5230000	Yeah, it does.
5230000	5232000	It has that same cartoony, cutesy style.
5232000	5234000	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
5234000	5237000	Now, the one thing about this, though, is that...
5237000	5238000	It's like a little shop.
5238000	5240000	He just flew in the shop, like you do in Fantasy Zone.
5240000	5242000	Exactly, exactly.
5242000	5246000	With this particular one, you basically...
5246000	5250000	Like, for example, Miyuki-chan will stop by, like you were just saying.
5250000	5257000	When Dream Company passes by, you can win crystals to buy weapons.
5257000	5263000	But you have one-hit kills, but you can buy your extra lives as you go through the game.
5263000	5265000	It's just a cutesy little game.
5265000	5266000	I mean, it was fun.
5266000	5268000	Not a whole bunch extra special to it.
5268000	5271000	Oh, they do like a little celebration dance when they clear the round.
5271000	5278000	And I do believe that this is the one that Albatross was from in Namco High.
5278000	5286000	So, whenever you guys see Albatross or Al-b-tross, as he is also known in that, this is the game he is from.
5286000	5291000	I'm going to double-check it, just to make sure, but I'm pretty sure that is it.
5291000	5293000	And that's your classic game.
5293000	5295000	What's this? Some type of roulette game that's in there, too?
5295000	5297000	Like little gambling games?
5297000	5299000	Yeah, that's when you run into the robot.
5299000	5300000	Oh, okay.
5300000	5301000	Pretty cool. Alright.
5301000	5302000	I'm just double-checking.
5302000	5305000	I have to admit, I had never played this game before, but I kind of want to...
5305000	5308000	I wish it was on one of the newer retro game collections so I could check it out.
5308000	5309000	But there it is.
5309000	5314000	Your classic game of the week, boys and girls, or dine, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5314000	5317000	Good pick, Dark Soccer. I like it when you pick things I haven't heard of.
5317000	5324000	And also, just to say, you know, again, if you haven't played Namco High, it's really fucking fun.
5324000	5327000	And it'll work on your phone because it is HTML5.
5327000	5328000	Alright.
5328000	5333000	I'm double-checking on the students one more time, just so I can be sure.
5333000	5336000	And it's not loading up, so...
5336000	5339000	Sorry. I'll probably be able to tell you guys soon.
5339000	5345000	Alright, well, maybe she can tell us after the break, because it is that time to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5345000	5348000	But we've got plenty more show when we come back.
5348000	5351000	I was wrong. Albatross is from Rolling Thunder. I don't know what I was thinking.
5351000	5352000	Alright.
5352000	5356000	Yes, there's not as much news tonight, so we're flying through that a little quickly.
5356000	5360000	But we do still have the mailbag. We have the FUGL question of the week coming up.
5360000	5362000	We have your phone calls a little later in the show.
5362000	5367000	And also, Listless tonight! It's been a long time.
5367000	5370000	It was Tamari. I don't even know what I was thinking.
5370000	5375000	Because Albatross is from Rolling Thunder, and it's another of those weird Namco games, so...
5375000	5376000	My brain went fart.
5376000	5378000	Are you sure you're done? Because I'm trying to get us to break.
5378000	5380000	Yeah, it was Tamari. It was Tamari.
5380000	5387000	Listless. 2014 predictions. FUGL. FUs of the week. Twitter calls. Sure. We'll call Twitter. Why not?
5387000	5389000	We'll do it all here on the last episode of OLR.
5389000	5390000	Twitter call-outs.
5390000	5393000	For 2013. Right after this.
5399000	5403000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5403000	5409000	We are live with our last episode of 2013 for this Sunday, December 29th.
5409000	5413000	And it is episode number 533 of our show, already in progress.
5413000	5417000	And a big hello to all of you guys there listening live at The Voice of Geeks Network.
5417000	5419000	Live.vognetwork.com.
5419000	5426000	And those of you listening to us on the podcast feed as well, be it through, I don't know, iTunes Podcast, or Stitcher, or TuneIn, or any of those.
5426000	5428000	A big hello to you guys as well.
5428000	5437000	Do remember, since those of you who listen on the podcast, there's a passphrase hidden somewhere in the show that you can punch into the website at vognetwork.com.
5437000	5440000	And if you want, you can use those points to enter the raffle.
5440000	5444000	And you don't have much time left. In fact, if it's after January 1st, you already missed out for the month.
5444000	5454000	But we're giving away a $20 gift card to many popular gaming services such as, you know, Nintendo Network and Xbox Live and so forth.
5454000	5459000	Why are we giving it away? Because we want you guys to visit vognetwork.com, of course.
5459000	5463000	And just because we love you guys for supporting the network and participating in the show.
5463000	5465000	So it's us to give a little something back to you guys.
5465000	5468000	So be sure to check that out over at vognetwork.com.
5468000	5469000	Also YouTube.
5469000	5474000	Yes. Jason, you've been working very hard on those YouTubes, I gotta say. And thank you for reminding me.
5474000	5483000	We just put up last week, we just put, because YouTube is, again, YouTube runs one week behind, six days-ish, one week behind.
5483000	5492000	Just because we prefer to have folks listen via the places that really give us ratings instead of giving Google ratings, giving us ratings first.
5492000	5496000	But then, you know, we like having it on YouTube for discovery purposes.
5496000	5502000	And, starting with last week's episode, Jason, I don't know if you really plan on taking that level of effort every week, but I was very impressed.
5502000	5510000	You kind of made it more of like an archive where you actually, like, bookmarked all the sections of the show and, like, very easy to find a part of the show you're looking for.
5510000	5513000	Some video synced up and things.
5513000	5517000	Well, the video is always gonna sync up, otherwise I just completely screwed something up.
5517000	5533000	But, no, I want to start doing more and more, and basically, I finally sat down and did chapters, and it's, you know, every time I do this, I'm coming up with new ideas, and I'm going to take it as they come to me.
5533000	5541000	It's like, you know what, we do the same thing. We've been on the air next year again, our twelfth broadcast year, tonight we're trying something new.
5541000	5546000	You guys don't know what it is yet, we'll surprise you a little later, I'll tell you what it is, but we're doing something new tonight.
5546000	5550000	It's just how you always kind of think, like, how can I do that, how can I take this one step?
5550000	5558000	And I've also, like I've said previously as well, I've also never done video work before, and it's always been an incredible interest to me.
5558000	5568000	And so this is one part learning design, this is one part doing video editing, this is one part being able to do a lot of post-production.
5568000	5574000	Yeah, I'm contributing in ways that are very fun for me, and I plan to continue doing so and doing better each time.
5574000	5583000	Yeah, do what you love, that's why I do this. And you know, since it is that sappy time of year, since we're getting towards the end of the year, one thing I'm going to put out there,
5583000	5590000	I got a pretty big promotion at work this year, which I'm very thankful for, I really like what I do for a living at my day job, and so forth,
5590000	5598000	but part of the reason, and part of the stuff that played into that promotion that I got, was that it was recognized, some of the stuff I do outside of work,
5599000	5607000	and that I work with audio and video and that type of production and things kind of outside of work, and that all plays into now, you know, what I do with my day job.
5607000	5614000	So like, you know, all these years later, OLR has actually like helped me get a job in a way, it's so weird!
5614000	5619000	But I'm so thankful for it, and thank you guys for supporting it, absolutely.
5622000	5623000	I got a job too.
5623000	5625000	That's right, you got a job as well.
5625000	5626000	I'm not going to say where I'm working.
5626000	5627000	Yes.
5627000	5634000	I'm glad that you actually know me in person, just because given the nature of the job, I don't really want to...
5634000	5635000	Completely understand.
5635000	5641000	But I will be doing some tech support, and that will be fun, but for every...
5641000	5646000	And this is the thing that floored me, is that I just happened to put it on my Facebook like I normally do,
5646000	5649000	I'm so happy I got a job, 120 people.
5649000	5652000	I was like, how do I know that many people?
5652000	5658000	So I want to thank everyone who supported me in my attempts to find gainful employment.
5658000	5665000	Thank you people who were just being happy for me, because that means a lot to me too.
5665000	5671000	You know, just a lot of selfless people I want to thank, so thank you.
5671000	5679000	And also listening to the break music makes me really want to watch Swing Girls again,
5679000	5683000	because Mexican Flyer is one of the songs they do for the finale.
5683000	5687000	We played some Space Channel 5 music here live, which I can't repeat on the podcast,
5687000	5692000	and we would especially not own that on YouTube, we get a copyright shutdown.
5692000	5694000	Actually, I don't know if Mexican Flyer is back in the public domain.
5694000	5697000	Well, the Sega version definitely isn't.
5697000	5704000	Well, no, but it is big band swing music, which really brought that genre into the fore.
5705000	5709000	So Actif says that we're happy because you're happy. Thank you.
5709000	5713000	And I got to give an arm of support to our buddy Brad over at Pod Culture,
5713000	5716000	because he's job hunting right now and he's looking for something.
5716000	5720000	Well, it took me three years, so I hope it doesn't take you that long.
5720000	5724000	But we are keeping our fingers and toes crossed for our friend Brad,
5724000	5730000	and if you need a really smart guy who produces a solid podcast about sci-fi and geek culture
5730000	5735000	and a little bit of games and a little bit of everything, hire Brad. Absolutely.
5735000	5740000	I do have to say it was very encouraging when I took the small tour. TARDIS posters.
5742000	5747000	Oh, quickly. Since it is the voice of geeks network and people are talking not just video games,
5747000	5752000	but did you watch The Doctor Who? I'm so behind on Doctor Who.
5752000	5757000	I haven't watched it yet, but someone spoiled The Regeneration for me.
5757000	5761000	We all knew who the new Doctor was going to be and when it was going to happen.
5761000	5767000	I'm just expecting him to break out into a string of curses, as Peter Capaldi.
5767000	5773000	But I did actually, though, I had to go back and watch the anniversary special while I was downloading it,
5773000	5775000	just because, ah, David Tennant.
5775000	5780000	That's on my list. While I game, I'm hoping that when we move and get our new place and our new office,
5780000	5784000	I'll be able to have a little TV so I can catch up on things like Doctor Who and stuff.
5784000	5787000	You know, a little person who has the episodes on her hard drive.
5787000	5790000	What's on Netflix too? This past season?
5790000	5795000	I don't know about the most recent season, but I only got halfway through the ninth Doctor,
5795000	5797000	and it's not because I didn't like it. I loved it.
5797000	5799000	I have that box set. I need to get that back for my friend.
5799000	5803000	I don't watch hardly any TV. When I finished Orange is the New Black,
5803000	5806000	that was a miracle that I actually had the attention span to watch 13 hours worth of TV.
5807000	5814000	At any rate, since I mentioned it, if nobody out there has seen Swing Girls, you can find it.
5814000	5819000	It's inexpensive now. Great little movie, and yes, it has subtitles.
5819000	5824000	But I just have to say, if you like the music in Space Channel 5, get into big band.
5824000	5828000	There you go. There you go. Loki, you still there with us?
5828000	5831000	Nope, he took a breath. Oh no, he's there. Hey!
5832000	5836000	It's so weird when I can't see you, but Loki Baby Watch is on,
5836000	5839000	which is why Loki is on Skype with us for a few weeks here.
5839000	5841000	But, Loki, any plans for the new year?
5843000	5845000	No, not really.
5845000	5850000	Since Josh dressed up like a firework for Halloween, is he excited about New Year's Eve,
5850000	5853000	or do you guys try not to get him too worked up about that?
5853000	5856000	Nah, he doesn't stand for any of that stuff. He doesn't know what's going on.
5856000	5857000	He doesn't know, huh?
5857000	5860000	He has trouble figuring out what day it is during the day.
5860000	5866000	He thinks when he goes down for a nap or something like that, that's another day.
5866000	5869000	And so he doesn't understand time right now.
5869000	5870000	Still young.
5874000	5876000	You and the jokes need to stop.
5876000	5878000	I never will.
5878000	5880000	I know, I know. Alright.
5880000	5883000	You want the intern Drew position here.
5883000	5886000	Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.
5887000	5893000	Alright, so next month they've got some pretty decent stuff on PlayStation Plus.
5893000	5898000	And I'm kind of excited about this in case you haven't played it yet.
5898000	5901000	Bioshock Infinite is going to be one of the titles they've given away free.
5901000	5905000	Devil May Cry, also Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons.
5905000	5910000	And they're going to have some stuff for the Vita as well.
5910000	5912000	Smart As and Warms Battle Islands.
5912000	5916000	And Don't Starve will be available for PlayStation 4.
5916000	5919000	So, not bad.
5919000	5926000	I'm really curious to see Microsoft step it up for the Xbox, you know, Games with Gold thing.
5926000	5930000	Because it's kind of hard to compete with Bioshock Infinite and Devil May Cry.
5930000	5933000	Games that literally came out one year ago.
5933000	5936000	Yeah, Sony's kind of on a tear with their PlayStation Plus.
5936000	5939000	Not only their free games, but their discounts and everything too.
5939000	5942000	They're making huge waves in this.
5942000	5948000	And, you know, especially considering as long as you purchase them, put them in your catalog,
5948000	5953000	the ability to recall them later and play them in a later month is fantastic.
5953000	5959000	There was the suggestions going around that even if you don't have a PS4 yet,
5959000	5964000	if you pick up, well, there's no free Plus titles for four, not retail.
5964000	5968000	But if you are a Plus subscriber, even if you don't have the system,
5968000	5975000	you can still buy it online and redownload it in the future, which is pretty damn fantastic.
5975000	5981000	And I've been doing that even though I've been away from my PlayStation 3 for two, three months.
5984000	5989000	Yeah, so I'm looking forward to it and definitely recommend anyone that hasn't played Bioshock Infinite.
5989000	5994000	Definitely give it a try if you have PlayStation Plus. It's worth it.
5995000	6002000	And then the first round of Grand Theft Auto online jobs.
6002000	6009000	These are created with the new Deathmatch and Race online creation tools that they released,
6009000	6011000	I think, literally a week or so ago.
6011000	6015000	And so these are now Rockstar verified jobs.
6015000	6022000	They have basically picked six races and four deathmatches that now will be kind of appearing everywhere online,
6022000	6026000	like the official Rockstar matches. And so that's kind of cool.
6026000	6029000	And they actually do have a system in there, as you may have seen,
6029000	6035000	with the actual official jobs where you can upvote or downvote or just not vote on different things.
6035000	6039000	And based on those and the more popular ones, they will become verified,
6039000	6043000	and you'll actually see them as part of the regular playlists and stuff.
6043000	6045000	So I thought that was pretty cool.
6045000	6047000	I know it didn't bleed through, but tell me if I'm crazy.
6047000	6051000	You two here in studio just heard that siren, didn't you?
6051000	6052000	The what?
6052000	6053000	The siren?
6053000	6054000	No.
6054000	6057000	There was an emergency siren that just went hauling in three...
6057000	6059000	Oh, in this neighborhood? I don't doubt it.
6059000	6061000	It was just well-timed.
6062000	6064000	A Grand Theft Auto story and the police are here?
6064000	6065000	Exactly.
6066000	6067000	Absolutely.
6067000	6068000	Works.
6068000	6069000	All right.
6069000	6071000	Well, I got a couple stories for you guys.
6071000	6073000	Another story about Doom. What's up with this?
6073000	6076000	It's like a blast from the past tonight with all this Doom story.
6076000	6080000	But VXJ and XV, tell me if you've heard about this one.
6080000	6083000	There's a mod for Doom that puts...
6083000	6085000	A mod for Doom? No.
6085000	6089000	Yes, it puts Resident Evil 4's Mercenaries mode within Doom.
6089000	6090000	That's cool.
6090000	6094000	So there's actually a little video of this here that I'll play.
6094000	6095000	Sorry, Jason.
6097000	6100000	It's very loud, but you see them going through the menu here,
6100000	6103000	and it's got the Resident Evil 4 stuff in here.
6103000	6105000	Leon S. Kennedy.
6105000	6107000	It looks like you can play as different characters there.
6107000	6108000	Leon's one of them.
6111000	6112000	Let's see there.
6112000	6114000	And for the chatters and podcast listeners...
6114000	6115000	That's right.
6115000	6117000	You can go to youtube.com slash orangelandradio
6117000	6119000	and view the video that we were watching just now.
6119000	6122000	Not the best radio, but the video will exist in a week.
6122000	6124000	Just so you know, so you can have this.
6124000	6127000	You do need a copy of Doom, and you have to have its multiplayer mods
6127000	6129000	in order to run this mod.
6129000	6131000	It's only about 85% complete now.
6131000	6133000	Now we're finally getting into some gameplay there.
6133000	6136000	Oh, that's a very recognizable Doom.
6136000	6139000	It's almost like they took Doom and made it over the shoulder.
6140000	6142000	Oh, he did the neck breaker.
6142000	6144000	Very Resident Evil 4 style.
6144000	6145000	Oh, yeah.
6145000	6149000	With all the little pop-ups that come up at the bottom there.
6149000	6150000	That's pretty cool.
6150000	6152000	I like that.
6152000	6157000	So, yeah, he needs the multiplayer mods, and that's very awesome.
6157000	6159000	Where can you check that out?
6159000	6160000	I need to...
6161000	6162000	It's linked in this article.
6162000	6163000	Yeah.
6164000	6165000	Was it?
6165000	6166000	That's almost as cool as...
6166000	6168000	VigLink.com. It's like buried.
6168000	6171000	That is almost as cool as ASCII Quake.
6171000	6175000	It actually just goes to Mediafire, so it's literally just a no-name dump.
6175000	6177000	Yeah, somebody's hosting site there.
6177000	6179000	Well, just Google Domero.
6179000	6181000	D-O-O-M. Doom Arrow.
6181000	6185000	D-O-O-M-E-R-O, and you can find his immersive mod.
6185000	6186000	That one's pretty cool.
6186000	6189000	Although, my favorite Doom mod to this day is still Gatchaman Doom.
6190000	6191000	All right.
6191000	6193000	So, yeah, check that out.
6193000	6194000	All right.
6194000	6196000	Also, a quick story here.
6196000	6199000	Final Fantasy X-3.
6199000	6200000	What?
6200000	6201000	That's right.
6201000	6203000	Not X-2, but X-3.
6203000	6204000	Hold on. Sit down.
6204000	6205000	Put your pants on.
6205000	6207000	It's not confirmed.
6207000	6214000	It's just that Kazushige Nojima, who was a scenario writer on the Final Fantasy series,
6214000	6220000	he wants to see Final Fantasy X-3 and says it may happen if fans want it enough.
6220000	6224000	And this is from a book from the Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters,
6224000	6226000	because those just launched in Japan this week.
6226000	6229000	We gotta wait for it for next year, but it is already out in Japan.
6229000	6230000	And here's the quote.
6230000	6233000	Quote, if there's enough demand, then we may possibly see new developments.
6233000	6236000	I would personally like to see a sequel like X-3.
6236000	6241000	So, I mean, we're gonna get a X-13-3 with Lightning Returns, so it's...
6241000	6244000	They just need to shut up and give us another 7 or something.
6244000	6245000	I'm gonna say the same thing.
6245000	6247000	Where's my damn 7?
6247000	6249000	What's your remake?
6249000	6252000	I got a full immersive remake of 6.
6252000	6256000	Alright, well, if you want to show your support, March 18th is the big day
6256000	6258000	when these games come out in North America.
6258000	6260000	If you're in Europe, you gotta wait just a couple more days.
6260000	6261000	March 21st.
6261000	6263000	So check those out.
6263000	6265000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6265000	6268000	Oh, I was just saying that my villager wants to kill Ed.
6268000	6270000	We had a message in chat from...
6270000	6272000	Who doesn't?
6272000	6274000	They're talking about modding all the Doom stuff,
6274000	6278000	and then Tech2030 says, seriously, Animal Crossing mod where the villager shoots everything?
6278000	6282000	And I said, my villager wants to kill Ed, because he won't leave my damn village.
6282000	6283000	I hate Ed.
6283000	6285000	And you've consistently hit him with bug nets.
6285000	6286000	Now I'm just ignoring him.
6286000	6289000	And I had him almost fully ignored and then accidentally talked to him.
6289000	6291000	Have you been writing him hateful notes?
6291000	6292000	You can't.
6292000	6295000	If you want him to leave, you have to ignore him.
6295000	6299000	And I'm like, I just want to murder him with my shovel.
6299000	6303000	Or embed the axe in his stupid horse head.
6303000	6306000	And then bury him with the shovel and see if he grows into an Ed tree.
6306000	6308000	No, no, no.
6308000	6311000	He's not even worth being fertilizer, okay?
6311000	6312000	Or glue.
6312000	6314000	Or glue. Or even food.
6314000	6315000	Or jello.
6315000	6317000	This is going to a dark place. Let's move on.
6317000	6319000	Super Punch Out!
6319000	6320000	Ha ha ha.
6320000	6322000	Uppercut, uppercut.
6322000	6326000	Super Punch Out is on Nintendo eShop for Wii U.
6326000	6329000	And you can get it.
6329000	6333000	It came out in 1984 originally.
6333000	6337000	And it came out on Virtual Console for the Wii in 2009.
6337000	6344000	And now it's going to be on Wii U Virtual Console for 8 bucks.
6344000	6346000	I'd buy that for a dollar. Not really.
6346000	6349000	Well, if you bought it on Wii, then it will cost you just a dollar.
6349000	6351000	I think a dollar fifty gets a Super Nintendo.
6351000	6355000	Well, and also now for the PS3 people,
6355000	6361000	there are two games coming out in Japan for PS3.
6361000	6364000	That is going to be Raiden 4.
6364000	6367000	Oh my god. I'm so happy. I have to import that shit.
6367000	6368000	Because I love...
6368000	6374000	No, Dan and I were just listening to comparisons of the first Raiden game
6374000	6376000	on different consoles trying to listen to the music.
6376000	6379000	And found some were really awful.
6379000	6382000	Did you know the Lynx version doesn't have any music?
6382000	6384000	And it's really terrible.
6384000	6388000	And the other game coming out is Colladrius.
6388000	6391000	So, yeah. Raiden 4 is going to be Raiden Overkill.
6391000	6395000	And then Colladrius is going to be out in 2014 as well.
6395000	6397000	So there you go.
6397000	6404000	Alrighty. Let's take a trip to our Foogle question of the week.
6411000	6413000	You take Facebook and you take Google Plus
6413000	6416000	and you slam them together and you get Foogle.
6416000	6419000	We're going to go over to our Facebook and Google Plus communities
6419000	6421000	where we're going to see some answers to our question,
6421000	6423000	which is very simple this week.
6423000	6426000	It's a holiday show for the last show of the year.
6426000	6430000	So what is one very popular thing people like to do this time of year?
6430000	6432000	New Year's resolutions.
6432000	6434000	Which, you know, for better or worse, people do them.
6434000	6436000	So we thought we'd ask our listeners,
6436000	6439000	alright, it's the last show of 2013.
6439000	6441000	Do you have any gaming New Year's resolutions?
6441000	6444000	Things you must do in 2014?
6444000	6447000	For example, part of what I kind of thought of was the dark soccer on the show.
6447000	6449000	It wasn't a resolution per se, but she came out and said,
6449000	6451000	you know what, I want to play one new game a week.
6451000	6453000	And I thought, oh, that's a good thing to kind of aspire to.
6453000	6455000	I think I'm going to be using DVR as my interval training.
6455000	6458000	So that's kind of your resolution in a way.
6458000	6462000	Yeah, I mean, I hate to use my whole exercise thing as a resolution,
6462000	6467000	but I want to use DVR and other physical games as part of my training regimen.
6467000	6468000	Alright. Fair enough.
6468000	6471000	So let's see what some of our listeners said.
6471000	6476000	Let's go over to Google+, where actdef said, get a better gaming PC.
6476000	6480000	Also, getting an HDTV is one of my top gaming priorities.
6480000	6486000	But, of course, like every year, my top resolution is finishing my massive backlog of games.
6486000	6490000	Redertainment says, must accomplish project buy a house.
6490000	6494000	Now, I'm assuming that's not an Animal Crossing reference, but it very well could be.
6494000	6495000	That's also on my list, too.
6495000	6498000	Actually, now that I'm going to be working, Dan and I are buying a house.
6498000	6502000	Moving to a nicer studio for OLR is definitely on top of my list.
6502000	6504000	That could probably happen if we buy said house.
6504000	6506000	Well, it'll be a race.
6506000	6510000	Anyhow, let's go over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there.
6510000	6514000	We had quite a few answers over there, but I'm in a good mood.
6514000	6517000	We didn't have a lot of news tonight, so we should get through most of these.
6517000	6522000	Andy R. says, finish more of the games I buy. Damn Steam sales aren't helping.
6522000	6525000	Critical Myth says, resolve to finish Mass Effect 3.
6525000	6531000	Play the two Dragon Age games and do even more Assassin's Creed cosplay.
6531000	6536000	Only finish Mass Effect 3 if you have the extended cut DLC downloaded and ready to go.
6536000	6537000	Do it if you have it.
6537000	6540000	Even if you're like, but I want to see what it was like beforehand first.
6540000	6542000	No, you don't want to.
6542000	6543000	No, you don't.
6543000	6545000	I made that mistake.
6545000	6550000	I watched them on the internet and I was like, download.
6550000	6551000	Exactly.
6551000	6555000	I waited to beat my game so I could download the extended cut.
6555000	6556000	There you go.
6556000	6559000	All right, going on to Fifth Dream.
6559000	6562000	I don't believe in making resolutions because I don't keep them.
6562000	6567000	But if I did, it would be to stop hoarding games like a squirrel and his nuts in winter.
6567000	6572000	I seriously probably have more games right now than I've played only once or never than all the other games I've had in my life.
6572000	6577000	Sure, most cost $1.50 to $10, but still I have that same problem.
6577000	6578000	Same problem.
6578000	6581000	Degenerate Johnny says, I vow to catch them all this year.
6581000	6583000	Catch what, you might ask?
6583000	6585000	I'll leave it to your imagination.
6585000	6588000	You better have a good doctor.
6588000	6591000	He means all the cards in Hearthstone, obviously.
6591000	6599000	Tech 2030 says, with a new Tales game and Tales HD rerelease coming out next year, I want to go back and play through all the Tales of English releases.
6599000	6604000	I'll get to replay the ones I finished and finally get to play through the ones sitting in my backlog.
6605000	6612000	Liam responded and said, to stop buying games I'm interested in on release at full price and I already have a stack of games to work through.
6612000	6614000	Instead, I'll wait for the price to drop.
6614000	6619000	Case in point, there's no way I'm spending 55 pounds on Tomb Raider Definitive Edition.
6619000	6621000	It's euros, isn't it?
6621000	6624000	No, euro is the little e with the...
6624000	6627000	I need somebody culturally...
6627000	6628000	Thank you.
6628000	6629000	Well, I lose.
6629000	6630000	Alright.
6630000	6638000	Our buddy Jeremy Jay from Koopa Club responded and said, my resolution is to finally play through all of the main series Dragon Quest and Warrior games.
6638000	6643000	It's one of my favorite series, even though I've only played four of them with any seriousness.
6643000	6645000	I need to do that someday, too.
6645000	6649000	Dragon Quest VIII on PlayStation 2 was so good.
6649000	6652000	And who doesn't love the first one?
6652000	6654000	Because we all got that strategy guide, right?
6654000	6656000	Good pick.
6656000	6659000	And then you can replay the silver lining as well.
6660000	6663000	Flashback to three, four years ago, OR.
6665000	6666000	Alright.
6666000	6670000	I actually put the symbols in chat because they do look rather similar at a glance.
6670000	6671000	Yeah, from far away, too.
6671000	6678000	Daniel S. replied and said, my gaming resolution is to stick to my game and not just jump from game to game.
6678000	6679000	Good luck.
6679000	6683000	To do this, I vow to get at least three platinum trophies in 2014.
6684000	6689000	Codeman responds and says, I would really like to dive more into Final Fantasy XIV.
6689000	6693000	Took a little while off and now everybody has multiple 50s and it's crazy.
6693000	6696000	I may have gotten my second 50 this week.
6696000	6701000	I would just like to be more involved with a free company and run dungeons more, etc, etc.
6701000	6702000	Now just to find the time.
6702000	6705000	Well, you know what they say, real life greater than games.
6705000	6707000	Yeah, that's been my thing.
6707000	6708000	Well, I'm still only 30.
6709000	6713000	Clover, well, the good thing is that game has level syncing.
6713000	6717000	So, Codeman and Dark Soccer and anybody else in our free company, I'm the Garsemer.
6717000	6721000	Just feel free to ask for help because everybody can level sync down and do stuff and it's still a challenge.
6721000	6726000	And you get, if you have like a level 48 or 49 character, you get great XP from it still.
6726000	6731000	I've actually been using the level syncing a lot for doing fates so that I can buy a stupid mount.
6731000	6732000	I'm still trying.
6732000	6736000	I had to get up to the job level so that I could buy my mount.
6736000	6738000	You know who else has been playing Final Fantasy XIV?
6738000	6739000	Bobby Blackwolf.
6739000	6740000	Bobby.
6740000	6741000	Bobby Blackwolf finally got into it.
6741000	6742000	He hasn't talked much about it but he's playing.
6742000	6743000	Yeah.
6743000	6744000	Good times.
6744000	6745000	Alright.
6745000	6749000	Clover Nikon says, purchase a PlayStation 4 the latter half of 2014.
6749000	6752000	My wife and I both agree that any issues should be ironed out by them.
6752000	6753000	Good luck.
6753000	6754000	I want to get one too.
6754000	6755000	Hopefully a little sooner but we'll see.
6755000	6758000	Ragenator says, I don't really do New Year's resolutions.
6758000	6762000	The closest thing to that is what I've been doing all along since this past March.
6762000	6766000	Buy more Steam games, preferably when they're on sale, and play more games.
6766000	6780000	Awesome Unicorn replied and said, my gaming resolution for 2014 is to ensure that no more of 50% of my playtime in Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII is spent recoloring and accessorizing Lightning's outfits.
6780000	6782000	This will take all of my willpower.
6782000	6789000	I really like that answer because the extras in Final Fantasy and how far they really go, that is such an appropriate answer.
6789000	6790000	Just in any game.
6790000	6796000	I probably sat there longer creating my character in Saints Row 3 than I did actually playing that first night.
6796000	6803000	I might be ashamed to say how much time I've killed in Super Mario 64, stretching Mario's face in weird ways.
6803000	6805000	That's part of the fun.
6805000	6811000	Osfer replies and says, I must play Final Fantasy X HD or else I will probably cry.
6811000	6816000	Also hoping that XV is released in 2014 after we've waited for so damn long.
6816000	6822000	Sj100Matt is last and says, my gaming resolution is to actually make a classic gaming setup in my place.
6822000	6828000	I have the bulk of my classic gaming stuff in boxes and have to keep swapping them out when I want to play anything.
6828000	6831000	What I would like is a full and nicely organized setup.
6831000	6837000	It's a Retro N5? Or just Retro N? What was that thing you called?
6837000	6840000	I call it the Retron 5 just because I love Tron.
6841000	6850000	I know it's cheating, but considering what you have to do to get enough inputs for classic games like that, not to mention if you don't even have composites.
6850000	6855000	And on top of that, a modern TV is going to have...
6855000	6866000	The way that we did ours at the old house was that we had the switch boxes behind with these demo monitors that Dan got when GameCrazy closed.
6866000	6873000	And with our switch boxes and the component in, we were just able to hit the box in the middle and we had everything out on one shelf.
6873000	6884000	There's another guy who has his setup to where he used crates with LED lights at the top of each crate so that it would turn on whatever system was active.
6884000	6887000	And there's ways to do it. You have to get a little creative.
6887000	6893000	But there are ways to organize it to where not only are your systems there ready to play, but they are also on display.
6894000	6902000	It's a little foolish for me to jump straight to the retro end because compatibility, if nothing else...
6902000	6910000	The HDMI, like TigerClaw says in the chatroom, Retron 5 looks interesting. The fact you can play your old games over HDMI, that right there is so appealing to me.
6910000	6914000	Just the cable space and everything. I know it's not the same thing, but close enough.
6914000	6919000	Because of my emulation history and everything else, I would have no problem with something like that.
6919000	6929000	Not to mention, I don't own those classic systems anymore. I've given a lot of them away to various friends that don't need new gaming consoles and just want to play an old fun game.
6929000	6938000	And so I've helped them along with that. Not to mention, the only system I owned before PlayStation was an SNES. But I have neither anymore.
6938000	6942000	You want one? I think we have three. Or four.
6942000	6944000	Well, I think all my games went with it.
6944000	6946000	We have extras.
6946000	6952000	I am not in the mood to start scavenging and building up and paying for all those cartridges again.
6952000	6955000	We actually are probably going to be downsizing the vault, by the way.
6957000	6959000	You want to move with all that stuff?
6959000	6963000	Yeah. A good two-thirds of it is in storage at Dan's mom's house.
6964000	6967000	I have a quarter of a wall of a vault over there.
6968000	6975000	One of the stacks sits at the ceiling. The stacks of components, cables, controllers. Yeah.
6976000	6977000	Amazing, though.
6977000	6981000	All right. Let's see. So that was pretty much all of our answers.
6981000	6987000	So there's nothing left to read, but still, join our Facebook community and Google Plus communities and answer future questions.
6987000	6993000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.
6993000	7000000	All right. Let's get into some more news and then we'll get into list lists and all that in just a little bit.
7000000	7001000	Loki, you want to start us off?
7002000	7012000	So like most console games, now Battlefield 4 has been banned in China and probably has a little bit to do with the China Rising expansion.
7012000	7016000	They say that it was banned for national security reasons.
7017000	7023000	So I don't know. Maybe they just didn't like the view of China in that game.
7024000	7036000	Well, do you think it's one of those games where EA might want to put out like a different version to try or just know they're just going to write it off?
7036000	7038000	I think they're going to write it off.
7038000	7039000	I kind of think so too.
7039000	7048000	Because basically the main problem with it is that they're saying that the campaign of that takes place, you know, a Chinese admiral is planning to overthrow the government.
7048000	7055000	You know, that's something that they really want to, you know, promote or glorify there.
7055000	7056000	Very, very true.
7056000	7061000	Do games have similar scenarios with just the legit like American government?
7061000	7071000	It's usually like, you know, you're taking out a terrorist faction that already did the deed of overthrowing the government or, you know, like future post-apocalyptic, something like that.
7071000	7074000	I'm thinking like Modern Warfare 2 and 3, that kind of stuff.
7075000	7085000	There's always like some sort of corrupt government entity in any of these, you know, especially a lot of the military first person shooters and stuff.
7085000	7096000	Yeah. Always some kind of a nefarious, what's the word, ne'er-do-well that is the actual focal point of all of this kind of stuff.
7097000	7100000	Alright, well moving on to a game that's hopefully a little less controversial.
7100000	7104000	Dragon Quest XI. No, it hasn't been announced yet. Sit down.
7104000	7108000	Dragon Quest X, if you forgot, is an MMO game that exists on the Wii U.
7108000	7115000	I guess that's one of the games in the Dragon Quest series our friend on Facebook would not be able to play yet because I don't believe it ever came out here in America.
7115000	7116000	It was only on Japan.
7116000	7119000	But some people still talking about Dragon Quest XI.
7119000	7126000	Now, I guess there was some thought that Dragon Quest XI could be mobile, that it could end up being a mobile game.
7126000	7133000	I mean, after all, Square has been putting out more and more stuff on the iPhone, iPad, iOS system and Android and so forth.
7133000	7139000	You know, like Final Fantasy 3, 4, 5 are all there. I think 6 actually just is coming out or just came out.
7139000	7145000	I kind of stopped downloading all those because they're a little bit pricey and, you know, they're not as good as the originals.
7145000	7149000	But some folks thinking that Dragon Quest XI might go that way.
7149000	7157000	But Square Enix mobile developer Takehiro Ando would like to clarify some things in a Fumitsu column saying, quote,
7157000	7162000	At the current stage, there are no talks about making Dragon Quest XI for smartphones.
7162000	7167000	I believe there's still plenty left to overcome before we release a proper sequel for smartphones.
7167000	7172000	So we don't know when Dragon Quest XI will be out or what system it will be on.
7173000	7181000	I would guess PlayStation 4, but that's a huge question mark and so we'll see what happens with that.
7181000	7185000	But it does not sound like it will be on mobile phones.
7185000	7190000	Part of this, by the way, the reason why people think Dragon Quest XI could be on mobile phones,
7190000	7193000	I guess there is a version of Dragon Quest X that is coming to mobile phones.
7193000	7200000	I can't imagine it nearly matches the experience of Dragon Quest X on, like, Wii U or something.
7200000	7202000	And again, you'd be surprised how...
7202000	7206000	It was originally on Wii, now that I think about it. Wii U was like a special version. It was originally on Wii.
7206000	7209000	You'd be surprised how well some of this stuff can do mobily.
7209000	7215000	There's a fair number of MOBAs and MMOs and they find ways of making it work.
7215000	7221000	You know, input schemes that people are willing to put up with to play on their favorite franchise.
7221000	7224000	Alright, Darsakura, what do you have for us?
7224000	7227000	Chatting about classic consoles, actually.
7227000	7229000	What a surprise.
7229000	7233000	But, speaking of classics, and we did bring this up before a few weeks ago,
7233000	7237000	but there's been an update because the BBC is now paying attention to it.
7237000	7242000	That internet archive thing that's putting the 70s and 80s games online,
7242000	7247000	the collection is including the Atari 2600, the ColecoVision,
7247000	7250000	but the games don't yet have sound, however they will.
7250000	7257000	And, like I said, the BBC is covering this now because the archive apparently is expanding.
7258000	7261000	What kind of cool stuff can I play in there?
7261000	7269000	Well, the worry is that some of these are going to be illegal because they're ROMs.
7269000	7272000	You have to have the emulator to play them.
7272000	7276000	But the much older games are supposed to be available for legal play
7276000	7281000	and it's not actually listing a specific type.
7281000	7284000	Okay, there we go. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Frogger are in the archives.
7284000	7288000	They are also including Atari's 7800, Magnavox Odyssey,
7288000	7292000	which in Europe was the Philips video pack G7000, and the Astrocade.
7295000	7296000	There you go.
7296000	7298000	Yeah, it's expanded.
7298000	7302000	Alright, well, from the classics to the future, you guys,
7302000	7307000	it's time to predict 2014 in a segment we call here at Orange Lounge Radio,
7307000	7309000	Listless!
7310000	7315000	Alright, and, of course, as the show where every gamer has a voice,
7315000	7320000	you guys listening live play an important role in the Listless process.
7320000	7324000	So head on over to live.vognetwork.com so you can play along with us.
7324000	7328000	Those of you listening on the podcast, I'm sorry we don't yet have the functionality for the podcast,
7328000	7332000	listeners should participate too, but that is something we are working on for 2014.
7332000	7336000	So listen along and have fun with us as we predict tonight's question,
7337000	7341000	what will happen in gaming in 2014?
7341000	7344000	What are your gaming predictions for 2014?
7344000	7347000	Now to take a walk down memory lane real quick,
7347000	7350000	let me see if I can pull this up real quick because we actually have,
7350000	7355000	I don't know if you guys know this, but there's an Orange Lounge Radio Wikipedia.
7355000	7357000	Did you guys know that? There's a Wikipedia,
7357000	7360000	and we actually aren't even involved in it.
7360000	7362000	I mean, we're on it, obviously, because of OLR,
7362000	7364000	but some of our awesome listeners,
7364000	7366000	like I know Orange Wright does a lot of this,
7366000	7368000	Tetsuya does, and I know I'm leaving a ton of people out,
7368000	7370000	but they actually, if you wonder,
7370000	7373000	why do they keep talking about ferrets on the show?
7373000	7375000	What is the inside joke?
7375000	7378000	You can check that out, orangeloungeradio.wiki.com.
7378000	7380000	Midna found the ferret, by the way.
7380000	7381000	Did she?
7381000	7382000	Yes.
7382000	7385000	Well, one of the pages there on the Wikipedia is Listless,
7385000	7390000	and it tells you every definitive list we've ever come up with here on Orange Lounge Radio
7390000	7393000	because this is a process where we will come up with the definitive list.
7393000	7399000	And so last year, at this time, we did 2013 predictions.
7399000	7402000	So shall I remind you about what we predicted for 2013?
7402000	7403000	Do it.
7403000	7405000	The number one answer was...
7405000	7408000	Oh, shoot, I just lost it. Damn it.
7408000	7410000	Sorry, guys.
7410000	7413000	The unfortunate thing about orangeloungeradio.wiki
7413000	7416000	is that it has some unfortunate full-screen ads that get in the way.
7416000	7417000	Here we go.
7417000	7420000	No PlayStation 4 was the number one answer.
7420000	7421000	Accurate.
7421000	7422000	Oops.
7422000	7424000	Well, none of us bought it.
7424000	7426000	No PlayStation 4 for the show. That much is very true.
7426000	7429000	And then there was a three-way tie for second place.
7429000	7434000	It was the Xbox lube is $100 with commitment.
7434000	7439000	A Vita price drop before the first anniversary, which that did happen, right?
7439000	7440000	That did happen.
7440000	7442000	And then Final Fantasy XI goes free to play.
7442000	7444000	So we were one for four.
7444000	7445000	There we go.
7445000	7449000	Instead of the Xbox lube being $100 with commitment, it's $100 more.
7449000	7451000	With dementia and brainwashing.
7451000	7457000	Hey, there's the voice of Alan Alchemy who's gonna be sitting in on Listless with us tonight.
7457000	7458000	Hi, Alan. How are you?
7458000	7459000	What?
7459000	7460000	What a good introduction there.
7460000	7463000	All right, I had to fade the music there a little earlier
7463000	7467000	because I don't want YouTube saying, oh, you don't own that song.
7467000	7468000	So there we go.
7468000	7469000	All right, getting into Listless tonight.
7469000	7473000	For those of you that have never heard Listless before, it is a very scientific process.
7473000	7477000	And there is no arguing, people, with this list.
7477000	7483000	Okay, this is the list of predictions for 2014, the official gaming community predictions.
7483000	7491000	Each host and guest participating tonight will go around and give their top three answers for what should go on the list.
7491000	7496000	Then, in a very difficult round, we will go around and each take one item off of the list,
7496000	7500000	which then you guys, the chatters, can vote on.
7500000	7503000	And you will vote for your number one and your number two answers.
7503000	7506000	And then we will have ourselves a definitive list.
7506000	7508000	So let's put it up on the board.
7508000	7511000	Here we go over at live.vognetwork.com.
7511000	7514000	What are your gaming predictions for 2014?
7514000	7521000	Participating tonight with us, of course, DarkSakura, Loki, VX JasonXV, the voice of the show, myself,
7521000	7524000	and Alan Alchemy, as you just heard there a minute ago.
7524000	7525000	Which, by the way, how are you, Alan?
7525000	7527000	What have you been playing these days?
7527000	7529000	What does a gaming week look like for you these days?
7529000	7531000	Lots of Final Fantasy XIV.
7531000	7532000	Yeah?
7532000	7534000	What have you been accomplishing in that game?
7534000	7536000	I'm working on my relic.
7536000	7537000	Working on your relic?
7537000	7538000	Yeah.
7538000	7539000	This big number has been getting bigger.
7539000	7541000	That's right. Big numbers getting bigger.
7541000	7542000	Monsters getting bigger.
7542000	7543000	Fights getting crazier.
7543000	7544000	All right.
7544000	7545000	All right.
7545000	7550000	So if you are logged in, you do have to be a logged in participant over at live.vognetwork.com.
7550000	7552000	But, of course, we don't ask for your money. It's free.
7552000	7553000	We don't spam you or any of that shit.
7553000	7556000	So check that out over at vognetwork.com.
7556000	7562000	And you guys in the chat can shout out your answers because we may use some of them here on the show,
7562000	7565000	especially as answers get stolen because sometimes there's duplicate answers and so forth.
7565000	7568000	So as we did before, ladies first.
7568000	7574000	DarkSakura, what is your number three pick for gaming prediction for 2014?
7574000	7576000	Serious or silly? Whatever you want.
7576000	7580000	World of Warcraft loses over a million subscribers over the course of 2014.
7580000	7583000	So WoW loses a million more.
7583000	7584000	Over.
7584000	7588000	A minimum of a million subscribers over the course of 2014.
7588000	7591000	Okay. And why do you say that?
7591000	7593000	Because it's shit.
7593000	7594000	No.
7594000	7596000	Come on. Don't hate on WoW. There's still a lot of friends I have that play.
7596000	7598000	I still like WoW.
7598000	7606000	I just don't think that the new expansion, even with as much as it kind of had me excited, I don't think it's enough to save it.
7606000	7609000	It's too little, too late. They're just throwing bones now.
7609000	7613000	And, yeah, they may get a few lore nerds back and happy.
7613000	7615000	And I'm a lore nerd.
7615000	7618000	How many of those books are on my shelves, you know?
7618000	7624000	And I would probably, you know, play for a week to see the content and then quit again.
7624000	7628000	So it's just not enough for me.
7628000	7630000	All right. So there it is up on the board.
7630000	7632000	WoW loses one million subs over the year.
7632000	7634000	All right. Let's go to Loki with your number three answer.
7634000	7640000	Loki, your 2014 prediction. What will happen in 2014, Loki, per your crystal ball?
7640000	7651000	I would say after Mario Kart 8 fails to sell enough consoles for Nintendo, and I'm talking about the Wii, of course, that they will finally drop the price.
7654000	7655000	Stolen one already.
7655000	7657000	You were thinking the same thing?
7657000	7658000	Oh, absolutely.
7658000	7662000	You guys, maybe not for that reason, but a price drop is going to happen just because.
7662000	7664000	You guys are in, like, super pessimist.
7664000	7667000	Oh, OK. So you think a price drop is inevitable for the Wii?
7667000	7671000	I think Mario Kart 8 is going to do fucking fantastic, but I think a price drop is going to happen.
7671000	7674000	Yeah, that's my thing too. I also think Mario Kart 8 is going to do really well.
7674000	7678000	But why do you think it's going to fail? You just think it's going to fail because there's not going to be the Wii U's out there or whatever?
7678000	7684000	I think it's just, it can still be a good game, but it's just not going to be enough for people to buy the console for.
7684000	7692000	I mean, some people might, but it's just not going to be enough to make a huge enough difference to where, you know, all of a sudden it's going to be a 3DS.
7692000	7694000	Well, it's a good thing we have an elimination round.
7694000	7700000	The question is, am I being meaner by saying that it's going to drop anyways as compared to Loki?
7700000	7706000	No, because I do think it will drop in price. I mean, all the consoles will drop in price next holiday. They all will.
7706000	7708000	And the Wii U will be two years old next year.
7708000	7714000	Yeah, so, but we'll see. So there it is. I'm going to put it on the board anyway. Mario Kart 8 fails. Wii U price dropped.
7714000	7721000	Jason, I know you just said he jacked one of your answers, but I got to pick on you now. Number 3, what's your number 3 answer?
7721000	7727000	Half Life 3 question mark, smiley face, frowny face won't get released.
7731000	7735000	Half Life 3 question mark, smiley face won't get released.
7735000	7741000	Won't get released, which is kind of vague because that allows for an announcement.
7741000	7746000	Or do you think 2014 is going to be a complete information void toilet for Half Life 3 still?
7746000	7748000	I mean, it already has been.
7748000	7750000	Hasn't it always been?
7750000	7756000	I don't expect it to change, but I'm going to stick squarely with no Half Life 3.
7756000	7763000	Okay, so there it is up on the board. Half Life 3 won't get released up on the board next to duh and of course.
7763000	7772000	Alright, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. Alright, my number 3 answer, I'll go next with my number 3 answer.
7772000	7777000	My number 3 answer, and I know I'm going to have like two of you guys going, God damn it, that's what I picked.
7777000	7783000	My number 3 answer is Ouya Goes Under. Ouya calls it a day.
7783000	7786000	I just, I think it's...
7786000	7787000	You went there?
7787000	7792000	I went there, I'm sorry, but it's just one of those things that had a huge fanfare and now it's kind of went pfft.
7792000	7796000	And you know, I realize they're doing great things for indies and all that, but I just...
7796000	7799000	But Ouya 2, Rob, Ouya 2.
7799000	7802000	Yeah, Ouya 2 soon, so...
7802000	7809000	I'm sticking to it. Take it off if you don't agree. Ouya Goes Under. And so I'm going to put that up on the board.
7809000	7812000	These are some really real talk topics happening here.
7812000	7818000	This is a gamershateeverything.com edition. Come on, guys. Cheer it up a little bit.
7818000	7820000	Happy faces. Talk about what you do like.
7820000	7827000	Alright, they're going to lose a million subs and then they're going to fail and you're still not going to get your damn game and then the company's going to go under.
7827000	7833000	Alright, Alan, maybe you have a cheerful number 3 answer or maybe you don't, but what is your number 3 answer?
7833000	7839000	Actually, you pointing that out made me think of something really dark and grim that I wasn't going to say previously.
7839000	7841000	So, whether or not I say it is...
7841000	7844000	Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it. Who wants Alan to go there?
7844000	7847000	Go there, go there, go there.
7847000	7852000	One of the big Nintendo godfathers of gaming will pass away.
7852000	7856000	Stop, that is too soon. No, you can't say that.
7856000	7857000	Yes, he can.
7857000	7863000	The Zelda Mario dude, one of them. The Final Fantasy, one of the big 8-bit godfathers.
7863000	7864000	You are awful and you should feel awful.
7864000	7867000	They're all like pushing 70, right?
7867000	7869000	That's not very old anymore.
7869000	7872000	Well, it's true, but people fall downstairs every day.
7872000	7876000	At least, let's hope that none of them get hit by a car like what's-his-face.
7876000	7879000	This is supposed to be a funny segment, you guys.
7879000	7882000	I wouldn't have thought of it if you didn't point it out.
7882000	7883000	I'm going to need...
7883000	7884000	Sarah!
7884000	7888000	I need everybody to eliminate number three answers.
7888000	7892000	Wouldn't falling downstairs be kind of ironic in the whole Paul Walker ironic?
7892000	7898000	Because, you know, they do have to climb stairs at the very end of each Mario level to jump on the goalpost.
7898000	7903000	No, it would be ironic if he gets kidnapped by a monkey and taken to the top of a skyrise.
7903000	7905000	That would be ironic.
7907000	7908000	Alright.
7909000	7910000	So I'm going to need us all to...
7910000	7912000	Let's try to make it a little bit happier.
7912000	7914000	Go on to number two and then we'll just eliminate all the threes.
7914000	7915000	Alright.
7915000	7917000	Alright, let's try again.
7917000	7918000	Your number two...
7918000	7924000	So far, since I have to read it anyway, the super dark 2014 gaming crash number two predictions list.
7924000	7926000	Wow! loses a million subs over the year.
7926000	7928000	Mario Kart 8 fails. Wii U price drop.
7928000	7929000	Half-Life 3 won't get released.
7929000	7932000	Ouya goes under and 8-bit godfather passes.
7932000	7933000	Alright.
7933000	7936000	Let's go on to the number two happy shiny answers.
7936000	7937000	Dark Sakura.
7937000	7938000	Dark Sakura.
7938000	7939000	Stop influencing me.
7939000	7940000	Alright.
7940000	7941000	Dark Sakura.
7941000	7942000	What is your number two answer?
7942000	7946000	There will be another huge shipping war on Tumblr based on screenshots for the next Mass Effect.
7949000	7955000	When people are shipping background characters, there will be shipping on screencaps.
7955000	7958000	And remind us if you do not know what shipping means.
7958000	7959000	Relationships.
7959000	7960000	People fucking.
7962000	7964000	Those are two very different things, actually.
7964000	7966000	It's fan-driven.
7966000	7971000	Okay, there is a big annoyance I have with just, oh, these two characters are friends.
7971000	7972000	They're fucking.
7972000	7973000	No, they might not be fucking.
7973000	7974000	But anyway.
7974000	7979000	But no, it's basically the shipping is going to happen based on screencaptures.
7979000	7980000	People are going to make assumptions.
7980000	7984000	Tumblr is going to piss themselves and ship all the things.
7985000	7987000	So Dark Sakura is number two answer.
7987000	7990000	The internet will exist is up on the board.
7990000	7991000	No, no, no.
7991000	7993000	Rule 34 will continue.
7993000	7995000	Mass Effect 4 will be shipped before it ships.
7995000	7998000	Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.
7998000	8004000	I guess I should really change that to say new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.
8004000	8006000	We'll change that answer a little bit there and alter that on the board.
8006000	8010000	Alright, Loki, dare I ask, your number two answer.
8011000	8013000	Hey, I actually don't have a negative one this time.
8013000	8020000	I was going to say Left for Dead 3 and Source 2 will be out next year.
8020000	8021000	There it is.
8021000	8025000	Left for Dead 3 and Source 2 makes its way out next year.
8025000	8026000	Seems logical.
8026000	8027000	Why not?
8027000	8033000	It's going to be really weird when like L4D4, Left for Dead 4 comes out just because numbers.
8033000	8042000	The thought was because when they announced Portal 2, they made Portal 1 free to download temporarily.
8042000	8049000	Same with Left for Dead 2 just happened where they made it free for a day just to build up the game.
8049000	8051000	Just to build up the user base of it.
8051000	8054000	So, most likely an announcement will be coming soon for that.
8055000	8062000	I've theorized previously that Left for Dead 3 and Source 2 running for a year will be the testing,
8062000	8068000	putting the toe in the water that Valve needs to make any sort of announcement on Half-Life 3.
8068000	8069000	Nope.
8070000	8071000	Announcement?
8071000	8072000	Alright.
8072000	8073000	We did have that conversation.
8073000	8074000	But that's not even an entry.
8074000	8075000	That's just...
8075000	8076000	No, that's fine.
8076000	8077000	That's fine.
8077000	8078000	Besides, it's not your turn.
8078000	8080000	Jason, what is your number 2 answer?
8080000	8083000	I'm personally ready for L4D20.
8083000	8084000	Sorry.
8084000	8085000	Anyways.
8085000	8088000	Oculus Rift released, 4K resolution.
8091000	8097000	As opposed to their current expectation, which is 128800?
8097000	8105000	I was going to say, we know Oculus Rift is coming, but you say Oculus Rift is going to blow something away with resolution and quality and not just current expectations.
8105000	8107000	It is real fucking life, y'all.
8107000	8108000	Pretty much.
8108000	8109000	Oculus Rift.
8109000	8110000	Real fucking life.
8110000	8111000	Alright.
8111000	8112000	Fair enough.
8112000	8113000	There it is.
8113000	8114000	Up on the board.
8114000	8115000	Alright.
8115000	8120000	That is so funny that you bring up the Oculus Rift, and it is really funny because also in chat, we had SSJ100Matt says,
8120000	8123000	One of the big three will announce an Oculus Rift type of device.
8123000	8127000	Well, funny enough, I swear I have this written before the show tonight, but my number 2 answer?
8127000	8130000	Microsoft jacks the Rift.
8130000	8133000	What does Microsoft love to do?
8133000	8138000	They are going to take an idea that's popular in gaming and improve on it best they can.
8138000	8140000	I fully expect Microsoft to jack the Rift.
8140000	8142000	I'm not sure improve is the case either.
8142000	8144000	Why not buy Oculus Rift?
8144000	8150000	Because for Microsoft to fit that MO perfectly, they usually absorb the technology that they're going to remove.
8150000	8151000	Oh, they better not sell.
8151000	8152000	That would be horrendous.
8152000	8158000	Since it is a dark edition of Listless tonight, I'm going to go to a darker place and say Microsoft's just going to flat up steal it.
8158000	8163000	I mean, they'll do something, you know, obviously there's trademarks and they can't just steal it.
8163000	8170000	So, they'll put their own spin on it, but I'm going to say it's, I peg Microsoft does it, and they're going to, it'll be part of the one.
8170000	8176000	So, it'll be the, not the Rift, but the, you know, the Shift.
8176000	8177000	I don't know.
8177000	8178000	I got nothing.
8178000	8182000	But Microsoft jacks the Rift is my number 2 answer, and I'm putting it up on the board.
8182000	8183000	Alright.
8183000	8187000	Alan Alchemy, last but not least, with your number 2 answer.
8187000	8202000	Nintendo finally brings DS, not 3DS, but DS ROMs to a store on the Wii U, and somehow they make it disappointing.
8202000	8205000	I love how you had to tack on the, and it's disappointing, just to keep it dark.
8205000	8214000	Whether it be the price or the games that they actually announce for it or how it plays, they'll do it and it'll somehow still be stupid.
8214000	8215000	Alright.
8215000	8217000	Again, another dark answer tonight.
8217000	8221000	Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints.
8221000	8222000	Womp womp.
8222000	8224000	Alright, there it is, your number 2 answer.
8224000	8227000	Alright, let's run through the board real quick.
8227000	8235000	We have new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war, WoW loses a million subs over the year, Left 4 Dead 3 in Source 2 is out, Mario Kart 8 fails and the Wii U price is dropped,
8235000	8240000	Oculus Rift released in 4K resolution, Half Life 3 won't get released, Microsoft jacks the Rift,
8240000	8246000	Ouya goes under, Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints, 8-bit Godfather passes.
8246000	8253000	Alright, now it is time for the number 1 answer, the thing you most predict for 2014.
8253000	8256000	DarkSakura, what is your number 1 prediction?
8256000	8263000	I've actually been drawing a blank the entire time.
8263000	8272000	I mean, so I am going to say that an innovation within the video game industry leads to new advances for people with disabilities.
8272000	8286000	Like maybe Vision for the Blind, they're already working on bionic ocular implants, those are a legit thing now.
8286000	8290000	Maybe they're working on bionic oculus rift plans.
8291000	8296000	I need to knock this shit off real fast, I'm sorry.
8296000	8301000	So an unknown innovation in the video game industry leads to advances for the disabled, I had to shorten that a little bit.
8301000	8308000	We're already seeing it happen, so I think that something really big is going to happen that's going to turn around a lot of the negative press.
8308000	8312000	Let's hope. Loki, did you have something to add to that?
8312000	8316000	Oh, I was just telling Jason to stop it.
8316000	8323000	Alright, well shut them up with your number 1 answer, Loki. What is the number 1 prediction for 2014?
8323000	8333000	I've only been saying this the entire year, but I'm hoping that they'll do this because they'll definitely beef up what they have available for the system.
8333000	8343000	3DS games on the Wii U, using the gamepad as the bottom screen, TV as the top screen.
8344000	8350000	So you're going to just one-up what Alan said and say 3DS games on the Wii U.
8350000	8354000	Well, I've been seeing it all year long. It's an inevitability.
8354000	8359000	Fair enough. You can put what you want. There it is, Loki's up on the board with 3DS games on the Wii U.
8359000	8363000	He did leave out the point, though, that it disappoints, for what it's worth.
8363000	8369000	Alright, so there it is, Loki's number 1 answer. Jason, we're over to you. What is your number 1 prediction?
8370000	8377000	Jesus. Let's go with...
8377000	8386000	Indie game released to such fanfare, they get signed on to a major publisher for a AAA release.
8386000	8393000	The release doesn't have to happen, but the groundswell and fanfare has to happen in 2014.
8393000	8400000	Indie game signed on to produce AAA port of the same game.
8401000	8407000	I'm going to try to shorten that to say indie goes from indie to AAA in the scope of a year.
8407000	8409000	That works. Makes sense.
8409000	8415000	I'm going to say indie game and put that on the board. Any idea what that type of game could be?
8415000	8417000	A good one.
8417000	8419000	If you knew it, you'd be a millionaire.
8419000	8421000	Alright, you'd be a millionaire.
8421000	8427000	Bochikawa says, so like what happened with Portal? Something like that, right?
8427000	8432000	Well, yeah, that actually was kind of it because it was that Narbacular drop.
8432000	8439000	Alright, my number 1 answer. Here it is, it's a long one. I don't know how I'm going to shorten this for the board, but here it is.
8439000	8447000	My number 1 answer. In 2014, the year of Captain Falcon, F-Zero U is announced.
8447000	8451000	It's the greatest game ever made and we, you haters, can shove it.
8451000	8453000	Falcon Punch.
8453000	8455000	That is my number 1 answer. Falcon Punch.
8455000	8457000	F-Zero Boner Party.
8459000	8461000	That's how you condense that down.
8461000	8463000	Okay. That works. Nintendo's year of Captain Falcon.
8463000	8465000	That's what they're going to call it. F-Zero Boner Party.
8465000	8467000	Nintendo's year of Falcon Punch.
8467000	8471000	Nintendo's year of Falcon Boner.
8471000	8477000	I will accept that shortening. Nintendo's year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.
8477000	8481000	Fair enough. I like it. It is up on the board as my number 1 answer.
8481000	8487000	Alright, that means we are down to one more prediction to go up on the board.
8487000	8490000	Just before we hear Alan's answer, some of the things we see in chat.
8490000	8495000	Tech 2030 says Nintendo comes out with a 3DS player peripheral for the Wii U.
8496000	8503000	5th Dream says a Final Fantasy XIV expansion. Game Guru says 2014, the year we predict disappointments in gaming.
8503000	8511000	Tiger Claw says in 2014, Gabe Newell will announce the release date for the Half-Life movie.
8511000	8517000	Degenerate Johnny says Nintendo pulls a Disney and starts buying up purchasable third party LPs.
8517000	8519000	Yeah, IPs maybe.
8521000	8523000	I think he was saying Let's Plays.
8523000	8525000	Oh, I got it.
8525000	8529000	Degenerate Johnny says Hearthstone will remain in beta throughout the whole year.
8529000	8531000	Womp, womp, womp.
8531000	8535000	I like the SSJ100 nets. I'm going to get thrown out next year.
8535000	8537000	You already got thrown out last week.
8537000	8539000	That's exactly what I said.
8539000	8541000	But it can happen again in 2014.
8541000	8545000	Alan, there is one spot left on the list. What do you put in there as your number 1 prediction?
8545000	8552000	Bethesda confirms and gives an ETA for either the next campaign Elder Scrolls game or Fallout 4.
8552000	8555000	That's too wide of a net. Which one?
8555000	8558000	Fallout 4. We've been waiting longer for that.
8558000	8560000	So Bethesda confirms Fallout 4.
8560000	8562000	And gives an ETA.
8562000	8564000	And gives an ETA.
8564000	8566000	Wasn't there an article about that in the last week or two?
8566000	8568000	Sounds awfully familiar for some reason.
8568000	8570000	Yeah, it's going to be probably out in October.
8570000	8573000	Oh yeah, I'm sure that's a good one. I think that's an E3 given. Absolutely.
8573000	8575000	Alright, that's alright.
8575000	8578000	So here it is. Here it is, you guys. Here's what the board says right now.
8579000	8582000	Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.
8582000	8584000	New Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.
8584000	8586000	WoW loses 1 million subs over the year.
8586000	8588000	3DS games on the Wii U.
8588000	8590000	Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.
8590000	8593000	Mario Kart 8 fails and Wii U prices dropped.
8593000	8596000	Indie game goes from Indie to Triple A in the scope of a year.
8596000	8598000	Oculus Rift released with a 4K resolution.
8598000	8600000	Half Life 3 won't get released.
8600000	8604000	Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.
8604000	8606000	Microsoft jacks the Rift.
8606000	8609000	Ouya goes under. Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives ETA.
8609000	8613000	Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints.
8613000	8615000	And 8-bit Godfather passes.
8615000	8617000	I got a name from Microsoft's Rift.
8617000	8619000	What? The Jacked.
8619000	8621000	Be quiet. Alright.
8621000	8623000	I thought that was a really good name.
8623000	8625000	Because you're jacked into the game.
8625000	8628000	But you know, that is so opening it up to
8628000	8631000	I'm going to get jacked on my X-bone, you guys.
8631000	8633000	Yeah, I'm jacking my X-bone.
8633000	8635000	Duh. Duh.
8635000	8638000	Alright. Thanks for leading me to the joke that I was already at.
8638000	8641000	Here we go. A lot of these answers coming off the list tonight.
8641000	8643000	Because there's five of us. But that's the way it works.
8643000	8646000	Remember, we have a new rule for 2013 that will carry on into next year.
8646000	8650000	When a host loses two answers, their remaining answer gets immunity.
8650000	8652000	So think before you eliminate.
8652000	8656000	So Dark Sakura, you get to eliminate any one of these you want off the board.
8656000	8659000	Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8659000	8662000	I'm not going to say it's not worthy of the list.
8662000	8664000	But I just want to be a little bit less morbid.
8664000	8667000	And I'm sorry, Alan, but I'm going to take off the 8-fit godfather.
8667000	8669000	So nobody else has to.
8669000	8672000	I kind of thought that was going to go.
8672000	8674000	To be fair...
8674000	8676000	Even though it's probably going to happen.
8676000	8678000	We brought it on ourselves.
8678000	8680000	He said it was going to be dark.
8680000	8682000	And we made him do it.
8682000	8684000	I honestly think it's going to happen.
8684000	8686000	So I'm going to take it off.
8686000	8688000	Well, it is stricken from the list.
8688000	8690000	So we don't have to talk about it anymore.
8690000	8692000	Lee, you're up next.
8692000	8694000	I don't know if you can see the board there over at live.vognetwork.com.
8694000	8696000	But which of these is not worthy of the list?
8696000	8699000	Only because it doesn't really make any sense to me.
8699000	8701000	It just seems very uninteresting.
8701000	8703000	New Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.
8703000	8705000	Oh, new Mass Effect.
8705000	8709000	Well, to be fair, of course that's going to happen.
8709000	8711000	She's not wrong.
8711000	8713000	I know I'm not wrong.
8713000	8715000	That's a guarantee.
8715000	8717000	It's too safe a prediction.
8717000	8719000	And we're too edgy here at OLR for that.
8719000	8721000	So it is stricken from the list.
8721000	8723000	All right, fair enough.
8723000	8726000	Jason, it's a tough job, but that's what we do here at OLR.
8726000	8728000	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8728000	8730000	Oculus only has one C, by the way.
8730000	8732000	That's okay.
8732000	8734000	Will you strike something from the list?
8734000	8735000	You want me to strike that C?
8735000	8736000	I'm striking a letter from the list.
8736000	8737000	You're striking a letter.
8737000	8739000	All right, it has been stricken from the list.
8739000	8740000	Oh, my goodness.
8740000	8742000	That letter has been stricken from the list.
8742000	8744000	Shit, there are two very, very good ones.
8744000	8747000	And which one do I think is less likely of the two?
8747000	8751000	I'm going to toss out 3DS games on the Wii U.
8751000	8754000	Oh, 3DS games on the Wii U.
8754000	8757000	You're going to stick with Alan's more morbid prediction
8757000	8760000	that it's just the regular DS and it disappoints.
8760000	8764000	I don't think either one of them has the 3DS plays DS titles,
8764000	8769000	but definitely not 3DS games on the Wii U, unfortunately.
8769000	8771000	I would love it. Ain't going to happen.
8771000	8774000	All right, so it is stricken from the list.
8774000	8777000	Loki loses 3DS games on the Wii U.
8777000	8778000	Gone's gone.
8778000	8779000	All right, my turn.
8779000	8781000	I get to take something off the list.
8781000	8784000	I am going to remove from the list.
8784000	8786000	Sorry, Loki, but I'm coming for you.
8786000	8787000	You knew I was going to take this one off.
8787000	8791000	I'm taking off Mario Kart 8 fails and the Wii U price drop.
8791000	8793000	I think, again, just like the Mass Effect thing,
8793000	8794000	that's too safe of a prediction.
8794000	8796000	Of course, the Wii U price is going to drop,
8796000	8798000	and I don't think Mario Kart 8 will fail.
8798000	8801000	I think it'll be the second-based game on the console next to Mario 3D World.
8801000	8803000	So sorry, Loki, but it is stricken from the list.
8803000	8807000	But that does mean Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 coming out,
8807000	8810000	that gets immunity, and Alan may not remove it from the list.
8810000	8814000	So, Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8814000	8818000	Like a panicked engineer with a crowbar in his hand,
8818000	8820000	Half-Life 3 won't get released.
8820000	8822000	It's gone.
8822000	8824000	You are not allowing that to happen.
8824000	8826000	All right, fair enough.
8826000	8831000	Sorry, Jason, but again, too safe, Jason.
8831000	8832000	Good point.
8832000	8835000	All right, it is stricken from the list.
8835000	8836000	So there it is, guys.
8836000	8837000	That was a very tough process.
8837000	8839000	It was like pulling teeth, but here we go.
8839000	8841000	The answers you have left to vote for.
8841000	8844000	Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.
8844000	8846000	WoW loses a million subs over the year.
8846000	8848000	Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.
8848000	8851000	Indie game goes from indie to AAA in the scope of a year.
8851000	8853000	Oculus Rift released at 4K resolution.
8853000	8856000	Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.
8856000	8858000	Microsoft jacks the Rift.
8858000	8859000	Ouya goes under.
8859000	8861000	Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA.
8861000	8865000	Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints.
8865000	8869000	Those are some hefty choices, you guys, but you can vote now.
8869000	8873000	Now, some of you might be thinking, oh, all of those are going to come true.
8873000	8876000	Well, you're going to click on your number 1 and your number 2.
8876000	8878000	Remember, the first one you click is your number 1,
8878000	8880000	and the second one you click is your number 2.
8880000	8884000	Those are the ones you like the best of those answers that are up on the board.
8884000	8885000	So have at it.
8885000	8888000	It is now live, and you can vote for the next few minutes.
8888000	8890000	They're at live.vognetwork.com.
8890000	8892000	It is a live poll, and you may now vote.
8892000	8897000	And we will tally up those answers and read the answers here in just a little bit.
8897000	8901000	All right. Good times. Good times.
8901000	8903000	A little morbid, but that's all right.
8903000	8906000	I think we cleaned up the list pretty good there at the end, so it's a little less morbid.
8906000	8910000	We've got a few more stories for you guys, though, before we get to the answers
8910000	8912000	and the FUs of the week and all that good stuff.
8912000	8914000	So, Loki, why don't you start us off?
8914000	8916000	Thank you, Alan, by the way, for participating.
8916000	8918000	We'll let you know if one of yours wins.
8918000	8919000	Okay.
8919000	8926000	Just in case you wanted to check it out, there's another Telltale series that's free to try.
8926000	8930000	At least they have the first episode for free right now, The Wolf Among Us.
8930000	8934000	And you can get that free on Xbox Live Arcade.
8934000	8937000	And I'm not sure how long it's supposed to be free for, so better act fast.
8937000	8940000	And they're also doing discounts for some other stuff for the end of the year.
8940000	8946000	They've been marking down stuff, I think, all the way up through New Year's, so go check it out.
8947000	8950000	I've heard a lot of really good things about this game.
8950000	8954000	This is another one of those, I should have played it in 2013, but oops, I didn't.
8954000	8957000	So, yes, I'm very curious to check this out.
8957000	8959000	Wait, wait, before you run away, Alan, don't you read?
8959000	8961000	You read a lot of these graphic novels and stuff.
8961000	8965000	Are you familiar with the fables that the Telltale ones based off of?
8965000	8969000	I have the first three volumes in The Office, so yeah.
8969000	8971000	Are you going to check this out? Are you curious about this game?
8972000	8974000	It depends on what spoilers it has for the comics,
8974000	8979000	because I'm only on volume 3 of the trade paperback, and they're on, what, volume 30.
8979000	8982000	So I checked it out four years ago and haven't touched it since.
8982000	8984000	Uh-oh. All right.
8984000	8987000	They can still mark it for download, you know, just in case.
8989000	8992000	All right, well, you know, as most Telltale games, if you wait a little longer,
8992000	8995000	it'll probably be like five bucks for the whole thing at some point.
8995000	8998000	But at the same time, I've been hearing great things about it,
8998000	9000000	so I don't know how much longer we can wait.
9000000	9002000	So we'll check that out soon.
9002000	9004000	All right, Jason, what do you got for us?
9004000	9012000	A couple months ago, the Mighty No. 9 gang held a vote to determine the design of Beck's Helper Call.
9012000	9016000	Those votes have been counted, and design number F.
9016000	9022000	Take a bow. Take a virtual radio bow for everybody but the YouTube listeners,
9022000	9024000	because I can drive that point home.
9024000	9028000	Um, design F only won by less than 3%.
9028000	9033000	Design H came in third, and design E was the close rejection.
9033000	9038000	I really want to see what, uh, should be able to go see the vote and see what design E is,
9038000	9040000	because I really, really dig design F.
9040000	9048000	Very, very, you know, golden blonde hair, predominantly red, kind of lollipop striping.
9048000	9052000	Very appropriate, but really, really a good design.
9052000	9057000	Let's see, design F, that's E, this'll probably take me a minute.
9057000	9064000	So we finally have the primary two protagonists in Mighty No. 9, Beck and Call,
9064000	9068000	and what each of them look like, their relevant primary color scheme, and so forth.
9068000	9073000	Uh, she kind of looks like one of those cinnamon candy canes to me with the pink and red striping.
9073000	9076000	I mean, I know this is a radio show, so I can't really, like, show you the pictures,
9076000	9079000	but just imagine, like, you know, the whole, like, Mega Man style,
9079000	9082000	which obviously they're changing just ever so slightly for this Mighty No. 9,
9082000	9085000	but she's more of, like, one of those cinnamon candy canes with big blonde hair.
9085000	9088000	I think E was pretty good, too, taking a look at that.
9088000	9092000	They have the, um, designs, if you go to the second page of the Kickstarter,
9092000	9096000	there's a link on the article there. It shows the different designs.
9096000	9099000	But I like the, I like, it looks like she's gonna get something with her ears,
9099000	9101000	like, she got, like, helicopter ears or something, so that's, that'll be cute.
9101000	9104000	Those are, uh, oh, jeez, what are those called?
9105000	9108000	Um, they're, they're basically, like, hair...
9108000	9110000	I wanna say a hair tie, but that's completely incorrect.
9110000	9112000	Pigtails, you mean?
9112000	9117000	It's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a hair tie in a bow, basically, is what's going on there.
9117000	9123000	Uh, and suddenly my chat is not working anymore, so I can't paste this in, uh, in chat.
9123000	9125000	No, they got it, and Pochi, Pochi Kawa put it in there, too, so.
9125000	9128000	It completely stopped updating for me, so I can't even see it.
9128000	9132000	Um, because tonight is my night of puns,
9132000	9136000	should I read the, uh, the pun-tastic quote at the bottom of this article?
9136000	9137000	Sure.
9137000	9141000	Some of you may have just met Design F, and think it's crazy,
9141000	9144000	but she's got the numbers, so she's calm now, baby.
9147000	9150000	That is definitely gonna do it for the news for 2013.
9150000	9155000	Um, that is the last news article we are reading, uh, this year.
9155000	9158000	No Mighty No. 9 in our 2014 predictions, but I am very much looking forward to it.
9158000	9160000	Oh, that's cause it'll happen, it'll be amazing.
9160000	9162000	That would've been a very safe prediction.
9162000	9166000	Well, it's, they said it's gonna come out in 2014 when the Kickstarter whole thing happened.
9166000	9169000	Uh, I think, was it supposed to be 2015?
9169000	9171000	Ah, it was 2014. Uh-oh.
9171000	9174000	Maybe Mighty No. 9 getting delayed would've been a good guess, alright.
9174000	9181000	Number, uh, Style E is like, it's like a cross between Officer Jenny and, um...
9181000	9182000	Yeah, a little bit.
9182000	9187000	Oh, what other character am I thinking of? I can't even, I can't even think of a name or a universe to put it to.
9188000	9193000	They're all cute. Uh, look at, look at the Kickstarter page, look at the vote, these are, these are fantastic designs.
9193000	9195000	I'm really looking forward to this game.
9195000	9201000	Yeah, um, according to the Kickstarter page, the digital copy, the estimated delivery is April 2015.
9201000	9202000	Oh, wow.
9203000	9208000	Alright, well, uh, it is about that time, we're almost to the part of the show where we're gonna take calls,
9208000	9212000	but first, we wanna hear from our listeners in a segment we call The Mailbag.
9213000	9217000	Every week, you guys email us mailbag at orangelaundry.com,
9217000	9221000	and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst and finds a few emails that she thinks,
9221000	9224000	oh, this, this is worth looking at. Let's talk about this tonight.
9224000	9225000	I like Dee best.
9225000	9227000	Oh, you're looking at the...
9227000	9229000	Yeah, I think I really like Dee best.
9229000	9230000	Why is that?
9230000	9234000	Dee is like gothic, goth Lolita kinda, something like that.
9234000	9237000	Exactly, exactly. She's kinda dark and badass.
9237000	9241000	And I like B2 because it sorta gives me that Dr. Slump vibe.
9241000	9242000	Mailbag.
9242000	9247000	Alright, I know you're reading a lot of letters, but there's some letters in our mailbag as well.
9247000	9250000	And you're complaining about me tonight! Wow!
9251000	9252000	Wow!
9253000	9254000	Jamie?
9254000	9260000	Just a thought such as it is, I presume the YouTube content ID issue won't come to a head
9260000	9268000	when a major partner channel such as Tabuscus and Epic Mealtime and Vsauce gets taken down for content claims.
9268000	9273000	Rather, it will happen when Disney, say, issues a claim or has a claim issued on their behalf
9273000	9277000	against content from one of Viacom's own channels or vice versa.
9278000	9282000	Also, I'm disappointed that the Mac version of the Stanley Parable requires 10.8.
9282000	9287000	I'm hesitant to upgrade my OS on my 2009 laptop to even 10.7.
9287000	9293000	Much less seriously and too wordy, from what I understand, of the plot of Assassin's Creed 4.
9293000	9302000	I'd like to see them have taken as much historic liberties with their Chanties as with the music of Bioshock Infinity.
9302000	9308000	Ideally take inspiration from Dinosaur Comics and sing pop songs with babies substituted with Matey.
9308000	9313000	Everyone's trying to be me Matey, Matey I love your way, Matey done a bad bad thing and so on.
9313000	9315000	That comes from Robert M.
9316000	9317000	And that's the YouTube thing.
9317000	9319000	I'm full of it tonight.
9319000	9324000	Epic Mealtime is never going to have a content ID against them because all of their stuff is 100% original.
9324000	9328000	Here's something else to consider. As much as that's how we all want to see it go down,
9328000	9332000	you all know YouTube has a secret whitelist that nobody talks about.
9332000	9334000	The people that are on the whitelist aren't talking about it.
9334000	9338000	But that's why Viacom's not going to have a copyright claim against them ever. They're on the whitelist.
9338000	9343000	That's what some of the outrage was is because some of these people that we would have presumed were on it,
9343000	9347000	affiliates, notably, were starting to get screwed by this.
9348000	9353000	I think Epic Mealtime, Epic Mealtime primary channel will not, but their spinoff Original Gamer,
9353000	9357000	assuming that's even still a thing, I actually haven't watched it in quite a couple of weeks now.
9357000	9364000	Original Gamer stands the biggest threat because of their non-original content, non-original video.
9365000	9371000	But it remains to be seen what changes do and don't happen as a result of the last couple of weeks of fallout.
9373000	9374000	Next email?
9374000	9375000	Yes.
9375000	9377000	Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
9377000	9378000	Was there a name on that last email?
9378000	9379000	That was Robert M.
9379000	9381000	Oh, I missed that somehow.
9381000	9388000	I wanted to share a quick story. I just finished rebuilding my DDR pad for this winter and have been jamming about four times a week.
9388000	9393000	My legs have never hurt so bad and I'm a hardcore road cyclist. It's a different kind of impact.
9393000	9399000	Anyway, last night I finished on a heavy nine-step that is lightning steps for half the song.
9399000	9403000	My legs were jello, so I walked downstairs and completely pulled my left quad.
9403000	9410000	Now I can barely walk. When people ask what happened, I get a hazy look in my eye and tell them that I pulled a muscle dance into a video game.
9410000	9416000	You know their typical response? They smile politely and walk away. They don't know what to say. How awkward.
9416000	9418000	I don't know what to tell you.
9418000	9425000	I'm going to give you a little bit of advice a trainer gave me, but by no means am I a trainer slash doctor, whatever.
9426000	9433000	When you are done playing DDR, don't walk downstairs, don't walk upstairs, don't do anything more strenuous.
9433000	9440000	Walk slowly and stretch. Stretch while your muscles are warm and usually you'll avoid cramps.
9440000	9443000	That's just my experience, but again, I'm not a professional.
9443000	9447000	I think it's a generally accepted thing out there too. Make sure you always stretch before you play.
9447000	9450000	No, no, no. Don't stretch before you play. Stretch after you warm up.
9451000	9455000	If you stretch a muscle when it has not warmed up, you can do more damage to it.
9455000	9460000	Okay. Fair enough. I can see that because they do say you should walk a little bit before you do like stretching.
9460000	9465000	Well, here's an example. When I go to the gym, I spend five minutes on a bike or recumbent bike or the treadmill.
9465000	9470000	Then I do 10 minutes of yoga. Then I lift my weights. So just saying.
9470000	9475000	But always stretch after you've done doing anything strenuous because then that'll prevent cramps.
9475000	9482000	Am I getting old or am I just overdoing it? As a 34-year-old, this is my main form of exercise during the non-cycling months.
9482000	9487000	I'm sure you guys have had DDR injuries, right? Right? Well, actually, you remember the issue?
9487000	9489000	It's been a long time, but yeah.
9489000	9491000	I did fall and hit my head on the machine once.
9491000	9499000	But you remember those shoes that I had that I couldn't do jumping moves because the arch support in my shoes were sending pain.
9500000	9512000	It sent pain up my feet. And so I would come off of the machine with shooting pain going up both of my legs coming directly from my arches because I already have pretty hefty arches in my feet.
9512000	9517000	I don't have flat feet. I have the opposite problem. I have really high arches in my feet.
9517000	9529000	And when I changed from using arch support shoes to using either flats like Converse, All Stars, or the Airwalk equivalent and my Vibrams, that all went away.
9529000	9534000	So that was my biggest injury with DDR.
9534000	9543000	But I can tell you that I had pulled, actually torn a tendon in my foot in high school, not high school, in college in Alabama.
9543000	9551000	And I had been in just a loose brace for the next few years after that, but playing DDR healed it because I made my foot stronger.
9551000	9555000	To continue with email? You guys didn't have any other contribution?
9555000	9556000	No.
9556000	9558000	I did hit my head on the DDR machine once.
9558000	9560000	Because I don't want to make the guy hurt himself worse.
9560000	9566000	I haven't played serious DDR in a very long time, sadly. It is what it is.
9567000	9576000	There's a few people in chatroom, by the way. I def said I twisted my ankle playing DDR twice. Once on a cobalt flux pad. It was rather painful.
9579000	9581000	So to continue this email, it's almost done.
9581000	9586000	Loki, I got Surgeon Simulator on Steam sale today. Good grief, it's impossible, but hilarious.
9586000	9589000	Your loyal turtle in Philly. Serious turtle.
9589000	9592000	It's a fun game. And yes, it is impossible.
9592000	9594000	The space one is hilarious.
9595000	9596000	Okay, so last email.
9596000	9601000	Hey OLR crew, AZHP here. You get the last email of the year.
9601000	9603000	Bum bum, you win.
9603000	9605000	Air. Take a deep breath.
9605000	9610000	Just wanted to chime in with a few thoughts I had on PAX's diversity lounge idea.
9610000	9620000	I feel like that by labeling a room as a place to learn about diversity in gaming culture, it's making it seem like it will be the only room where PAX minorities can feel safe and at ease.
9620000	9626000	It's a hard sell to make a room shoved into a corner feel like you're being, quote, inclusive to people.
9626000	9635000	I also wanted to bring your guys' attention to the awesome games done quick charity marathon, which you guys mentioned last year on your show.
9635000	9641000	You guys talked about it after the marathon was over, so I wanted to make sure all the listeners knew about the marathon before it starts.
9641000	9651000	It runs from Sunday, January 5th through the 11th and will feature some of the best speed gamers from around the world, playing games fast to raise money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.
9651000	9660000	I got really into speed running after watching last year's marathon and started learning tricks for some classic games like Super Mario 64, that would be the wall jump, and Ocarina of Time.
9660000	9664000	Learning each new trick helps drive your time down and it's kind of addicting.
9664000	9671000	Side note, my best times on the games are 22 minutes for Super Mario 64 and 25 minutes for Ocarina of Time.
9671000	9688000	There are bidding wars and prize raffles throughout the marathon as well, so if you want to donate money to a good cause, have the chance to win prizes, and watch people completely wreck games that you love in ways you never thought possible, make sure to watch and just search awesome games done quick and it will be the first link.
9688000	9693000	Thanks for reading my email, hope you all had a happy holiday and have a happy new year, AZHP.
9693000	9700000	Thank you for reminding me of the charity event, I know Flaco Jones is a big fan of this too, it's an ex-feral and a horde house, watches a lot of this too.
9700000	9710000	So yeah, these guys are very popular and it's for good reason, and yeah, that speedrun stuff can be addicting. I'm terrible at it, but it's sort of fun to think about it.
9710000	9718000	Those people are just like, the level of detail that they understand a game's engine is phenomenal to me.
9718000	9722000	Well, I used to be able to do that when I was a kid.
9723000	9734000	So I was watching, there's a buddy of mine that grew up in New Mexico that recently moved out to Maine, and I've been watching a lot of the stuff he's been playing.
9734000	9749000	He knows Spyro, I don't remember if it's two or three, but he knows Spyro glitches, like the back of his hand, and he's getting really really good at getting the reproducible.
9749000	9765000	He's speedrunning Shattered Memories, even though I don't think there's really, I don't think there's any glitches in it, he just finds the best path and skips through the sequences and cutscenes, the doctor sequences as much as possible, as quick as possible, all that kind of stuff.
9766000	9785000	And that speedrun is literally just learning the best path to the game, but I revisited some of those awesome games on quick videos from the summer, and somebody was speedrunning Super Meat Boy just Light World Clear, I don't think he did Dark Worlds, but they also got Team Meat in on Skype.
9785000	9795000	And the programmers of the game didn't, they were shocked that they had never heard of some of these bugs before.
9796000	9811000	Whether they went and fixed them after the factor, figured out why they're happening, I have no idea, but just the level of dedication that, whether they stumble across it randomly or with skill, completely phenomenal, and everything about that production is so fantastic.
9811000	9820000	Great charity, great video, great skill. I didn't know they do it twice a year, so I'm definitely looking forward to being able to watch that in a week or two.
9821000	9828000	Did you know Dan and I actually tried for like an hour each trying to learn the wall jump in Super Mario 64 so that we could get up to the roof and beat the game?
9829000	9831000	I had heard of that, I don't think I ever tried.
9832000	9835000	There's videos up, and apparently it's supposed to work in the DS version as well.
9836000	9841000	I don't have the precision to play that on Mario 64 DS.
9842000	9845000	Alright, that is it for the mailbag.
9846000	9847000	Indeed, that is it.
9848000	9853000	This is also your very last chance to vote in tonight's List List. You're already slackin' if you waited this long, this is your last chance.
9854000	9863000	Live.vognetwork.com, and we will read the answers here shortly, but first we have the FUs of the week. Here we go.
9865000	9879000	Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...
9880000	9889000	I feed a pink berry for having peppermint and chocolate because it was so good and I want more, but I've had wine tonight, so no pink berry.
9890000	9892000	Wine's really good though, do you need any wine flavored pink berry?
9892000	9899000	No, you know what though they had in Japan last year, Rob? They had muscat grape KitKats.
9900000	9907000	And they were amazing. My friend who lives in Nagoya sent, you remember my friend Julie, right?
9908000	9915000	And our friend Krista? Krista lives in Nagoya? She sent Julie a bunch of muscat KitKats and we went through the whole box.
9915000	9922000	They're amazing. Okay, pink berry, get muscat flavor. Do it.
9923000	9925000	Alright, Loki, you have some FUs of the week?
9926000	9934000	I feed my cat who thinks I'm a pillow or something. She's literally an inch away from the microphone.
9935000	9937000	Alright, Jason, do you have any FUs?
9937000	9946000	I have nothing against alcohol, but FU do excuses to get smashed at 11 in the morning.
9947000	9948000	Oh yeah, that's a bit much.
9949000	9950000	That's what they do to people.
9951000	9957000	I was like, you're not gonna dog our wine drinking, are you? Gotta be responsible. We always advocate responsibility as well.
9958000	9964000	My FU of the week goes to, FU did the scare that Alan might be getting sick again and therefore I might be getting sick again.
9964000	9966000	I was just sick. I don't want to be sick again.
9967000	9970000	Hey, you should be more concerned for Alan being healthy so Alan can be healthy.
9971000	9972000	No, I want to be healthy.
9973000	9974000	So rude.
9975000	9976000	But yes, it would be nice.
9977000	9978000	Alan, do you hear this fuckery?
9979000	9980000	Yes, it would be nice if Alan was healthy too.
9981000	9985000	Alright, there it is. That is it for the FUs of the week. What are you laughing about over there?
9986000	9987000	Nothing.
9988000	9989000	You trying to start some shit? That's what you're trying to do over there.
9990000	9992000	No, I'm not. But you know what? I do want pink berry right now.
9992000	9993000	Of course you do.
9994000	9995000	And I don't want to get sick either.
9996000	10004000	Alright, that is it. We are done-zo with the question tonight from the listless question there.
10005000	10009000	I'm just waiting for the answers to load in there and we can tell you what the top answers were.
10010000	10014000	Here it is, the definitive list. Our predictions for 2014. Here we go.
10015000	10020000	Your number three answer. Where's Alan? Alan? There he is. Number three answer.
10020000	10024000	Number three answer. Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA.
10025000	10026000	So there you go. Number three is the winner.
10027000	10028000	Yay.
10029000	10030000	And I didn't mean what I said earlier.
10032000	10033000	Alright, don't cough up my mic.
10034000	10037000	Alright, the number two answer. Here it is. Number two answer.
10038000	10042000	Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.
10042000	10051000	And the number one answer, the thing that absolutely has to happen in 2014 as voted on by the listeners.
10052000	10056000	And thank God a shiny happy answer won after the dark places we went to tonight.
10057000	10061000	Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled. There it is.
10062000	10063000	Very good.
10064000	10066000	We're all nice people after all.
10067000	10068000	Sometimes. Eventually.
10068000	10076000	There it is. The definitive list. Again, that is Fallout 4 confirmed. F-Zero Boner Party and innovation leading to advances for the disabled.
10077000	10079000	There it is. Thank you guys for participating in List List tonight.
10080000	10086000	We hope to do that again. We have gone too long since the last time we played that game, so we will have to do that again very soon.
10087000	10090000	So there it is. That is it for the mailbag, the stories.
10090000	10100000	We are now ready for your calls tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10101000	10102000	It is that time to give us a call.
10103000	10111000	Now I'm going to apologize in advance. We're doing something a little different with the Skype line tonight, and so I'm getting to test this live on air as we're going.
10112000	10113000	So please bear with us.
10114000	10119000	But with this setup, we do not have to say goodbye to Loki. He can stay on the line and chat with our Skype calls.
10120000	10127000	If you want to talk to Loki or anybody here in the studio or give your own thoughts on what happened in 2013 or what you'd like to see in 2014, give us a call right now.
10128000	10133000	1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. One word.
10134000	10139000	Meanwhile, some last minute stories, possibly, maybe. Loki, do you have anything for last minute stories tonight?
10140000	10141000	No, sadly I don't.
10142000	10145000	Yeah, there's really not a whole heck of a lot going on, is there?
10145000	10150000	So let me see if we have any Twitter topics. I'm going to try to pull those up real quick here again while we wait for some calls.
10151000	10155000	1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word.
10156000	10157000	You know, I hope it works.
10159000	10162000	Do you know they have a new toll-free prefix coming up?
10163000	10164000	Do they really?
10165000	10166000	I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
10167000	10168000	They're just kind of going down the list of all the 800s, eight double digits.
10169000	10173000	I shouldn't be surprised that they're running out of stuff or whatever.
10173000	10177000	Considering how dirt cheap it is for anybody to pick one up now, and it's only getting easier.
10178000	10184000	It's weird that for that reason, it's not weird for that reason that non-phone number based systems aren't coming up. What the hell am I saying?
10185000	10189000	Alright, we are getting a call, so let's get to it. We are going to go to the phones right now and take a call.
10190000	10193000	Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10194000	10195000	Hey, this is Act F.
10196000	10197000	Hey Act F, what's on your mind, buddy?
10198000	10201000	Well, first of all, did it work?
10201000	10203000	Yes, it worked. We can hear you just fine.
10204000	10213000	Okay. Well, I was thinking about Jason's, one of Jason's answers. I think it was number one on the list list.
10214000	10217000	The indie game going triple A development.
10218000	10225000	And I was thinking about the My Little Pony fighting game that sees and desists.
10226000	10228000	Why are you laughing, Jason? You're laughing like crazy over there.
10228000	10231000	Because this doesn't surprise me, I guess.
10232000	10234000	Of course you're thinking about the My Little Pony game, right?
10235000	10245000	Well, I was thinking about that, and now they're working on their own game. Their own original game.
10245000	10257000	And I was thinking about and hoping that possibly it could get picked up like a big publisher or something.
10258000	10265000	And get a big release. Something like, well, maybe possibly like Skullgirls.
10266000	10270000	It was a small release, but then it got big.
10270000	10278000	I was going to say, to be fair though, Skullgirls wasn't really a triple A title.
10279000	10281000	I mean, I know it has a lot of fans, but it's not exactly triple A.
10282000	10285000	I'm not knocking it. I'm just saying. Right?
10286000	10293000	Well, maybe not that big, or maybe not triple A, but big. Mostly.
10294000	10295000	Fair enough. Fair enough.
10295000	10302000	What else? Any gaming resolutions you have for 2014? Or no, we read one of your answers during the Google answers, right?
10303000	10306000	Yeah, one of my Google... Well, one of... Sorry.
10307000	10308000	Something beeping over there?
10309000	10311000	Was that the Power Rangers theme? What was that? Yeah.
10312000	10314000	Yeah, it was my phone. Sorry.
10315000	10320000	Well, yeah, you already read my resolutions, and sorry again. Damn it.
10320000	10324000	Stop texting actdeft. He's on the radio, people.
10325000	10338000	Well, there we go. Yeah, all my game resolutions are mostly a new PC for gaming, because my current one is good, but not that great.
10339000	10342000	Mostly the processor is old, so I need to at least replace that.
10343000	10347000	And yes, Matt, it was a Power Rangers ringtone.
10347000	10350000	Yes, it was. Alright. Oh, go ahead.
10351000	10368000	Yeah, my other resolution, the HDTV, is my top priority right now, because I have the gaming consoles, and even the PC, which I have, the video card has HDMI out, so I can use that for gaming, too.
10368000	10375000	It will probably happen soon, since I'm pretty much saving the money for that.
10376000	10392000	So yeah, that's mostly what I want to do next year, and of course, my hundreds and hundreds of games on Steam, and not to mention an Xbox. I have the Xbox games that I haven't finished, so I need to get on that.
10393000	10397000	There's too much to play, but it's not exactly a bad problem to have, right?
10398000	10400000	Yeah, too much to play in so little time.
10401000	10405000	Alright. Well, Act F, buddy, we're going to let you go to try and get some more calls, but thanks so much for the call, and have a great new year.
10406000	10407000	Thank you, you too.
10408000	10409000	Alright, take care, buddy.
10410000	10417000	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line once again for some more calls, over at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10418000	10423000	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word. Skype line's open right now.
10423000	10429000	I was going to try to get to some Twitter topics while we wait for another call here, if I can.
10430000	10435000	I want to read a tweet. We had something from YYR, and I want to make sure I got this one, because this is really funny what happened here.
10436000	10443000	Okay, YYR sent us a tweet here on Twitter, and it says, the number one downloadable 3DS game in Japan this year, Bike Rider DX.
10444000	10450000	Why? It's awesome. It's $2.99 in the North American eShop. Buy it, OLR.
10450000	10458000	Alright, and get this. It was retweeted by who? The makers of the game. Look at that. Retweeted by the makers of the game.
10459000	10464000	So, very cool there. So yeah, I guess I'll have to check that out. I don't know much about that game.
10465000	10468000	Is it like a site bike? Because that's kind of what it looks like to me, just based on what little I see here.
10469000	10472000	I'm trying to see if there's some of the pictures here. Looks like a lot of this stuff is just retweeted.
10473000	10478000	Oh no, it doesn't actually look like a site bike at all. It's more like a little 2D platformer type of thing.
10478000	10481000	That's kind of cute. For $2.99, I'd try it.
10482000	10489000	So it's probably a style of game not terribly unlike Trials, where more lean mechanics and physics and all that kind of stuff.
10490000	10491000	Yeah, it might be a little more something like that.
10492000	10498000	This is a very attractive looking game. I've never heard of this before. 3DS eShop. I know what purchase I'm making in the future.
10499000	10503000	I was like, I think I might actually have enough left in my wallet now that it's shared between Wii U and 3DS.
10503000	10506000	Because I put like $10 in the other day when I bought Castlevania and stuff.
10507000	10510000	Which, I know I don't have to do that, but whatever.
10511000	10517000	Again, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, orange on radio, last chance to call the show ever in 2013.
10518000	10523000	So give us a call and we'll talk. Do I have other tweets? Let me look.
10524000	10528000	Let's go to other tweets. Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet for a future week.
10529000	10532000	Although I'm going to be real honest, I tend to only see the stuff the day of the show.
10533000	10535000	S2100matt sent us a tweet.
10536000	10543000	Nine year an MVP baseball lot lives on through the Latin American mod community with the MVP Carby.
10544000	10546000	I have no idea what this is even talking about.
10547000	10554000	I think it's Caribe. Because it was a... I don't know all of the backstory about this because I haven't followed a lot of baseball video gaming stuff.
10555000	10561000	But it's basically along the lines of a classic MVP baseball game totally modded for newer rosters.
10561000	10563000	I remember this game that's right and it's been long gone.
10564000	10570000	So it's been gone for ten years, this MVP baseball, because a licensing deal fell through for them ten years ago.
10571000	10579000	But things live on thanks to this remake essentially that's on the PC which is a celebration of Latin American baseball.
10580000	10581000	That's pretty cool.
10582000	10585000	Okay, now I get it. I have heard of this game before and you can check that out.
10585000	10591000	So if you like your baseball, Latin American baseball, you can check that out.
10592000	10598000	Let's see, trying to find some other tweets here over at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
10599000	10604000	Gemet Hunts tweeted us earlier this week and put, or actually it was just yesterday, saying,
10605000	10612000	Oh God, Sky, O-L-R, I got started on Tiny Death Star this week and also, yes, I know I'm a bit behind on shows.
10612000	10615000	That's fine. Not everybody can listen the week of the show.
10616000	10620000	But I was just going to say, I finally quit Tiny Death Star just before they put in the holiday stuff.
10621000	10623000	So I'm glad I got you hooked on a game that I quit.
10624000	10626000	Play the Doctor Who game instead. Damn it, Brad.
10627000	10630000	Brad was telling me about that game. Is it? How much is it on iOS?
10631000	10632000	Free.
10633000	10634000	I like that.
10635000	10637000	It has the stupid transaction thing again.
10637000	10642000	But, um, you don't need any of them. I haven't ever used any and they give you freebies all the time.
10643000	10644000	All right.
10645000	10652000	I think I've just, uh, I've been replaying levels actually to unlock characters until I got, uh, the Sontaran Butler.
10653000	10657000	And I can always forget that guy's name, but like I have River Song now. I'm very happy.
10658000	10662000	All right. Uh, I'm going to give one more shout out for the Skypline and see if we get anybody.
10662000	10668000	That's weird. No, everybody's, everybody's shy here on the last night of the year. 1-8-7-7 Game O-L-R or username.
10669000	10674000	I was worried that the setup didn't work because I have things run differently tonight, but, uh, Act Def got through. So I know it works.
10675000	10677000	No, I think that they're being reflective on the year.
10678000	10681000	They're just being quiet and pensive on the year? Perhaps?
10682000	10683000	I think so.
10684000	10688000	So there's a, there's a lot of Doctor Who games that all have subtitles. Do you know what the subtitle for this particular one is?
10689000	10691000	Crap. Let me look it up because I have my hand.
10692000	10697000	I'll do a couple other quick tweets if I can real quick. Um, there was a tweet. This was, I remember this email from last week.
10698000	10706000	I don't know if you guys remember this email last week from CK Ender who was kind of giving us another perspective and I believe it was the email on the NSA and it was kind of making us think differently about that.
10707000	10711000	Well, CK Ender sent us a tweet and said, thanks for reading my email and giving it a fair shake. Great show this week.
10712000	10719000	Hey, you know what? Well thought out opinions. We're always, I'm always for presenting both sides of the story. So I'm all for that.
10719000	10730000	Uh, let's see. We also have another tweet from earlier this week from Dave Falcon who said to the OLR gang, Sky, Loki and Dark Sakura, hope you and your families have a great Xmas and best wishes for Happy New Year.
10731000	10732000	Well, thank you very much. Same to you.
10733000	10734000	That was kind.
10735000	10738000	That was very nice. All right. And Tiger Claw sent us one more tweet again. This is the last call for calls.
10739000	10744000	I can't believe nobody's going to call in last show of the year except Act Deft. Are you guys going to let Act Deft have the final word this year?
10745000	10746000	All right, 181.
10747000	10748000	I think Act Deft has earned the final word.
10749000	10753000	877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10754000	10758000	Uh, Tiger Claw 305 sending us a tweet here and this is probably the last one for the year.
10759000	10763000	Porn discovered on 3DS purchased as Christmas present for 8 year old.
10764000	10765000	I saw that.
10766000	10769000	I can't believe this didn't make it in the show role. I even came across this this week and meant to put it in.
10770000	10771000	Here's why I don't necessarily like.
10772000	10773000	That was probably a bad choice of word.
10773000	10776000	Well, this is why I don't necessarily like talking about this article.
10777000	10779000	This really at its core has nothing to do with gaming.
10780000	10784000	It's just shithead moves giving all of us a bad name.
10785000	10789000	And I'm not saying you can't put porn on your 3DS. I don't care. Put all the porn you want on your 3DS.
10790000	10795000	Get rid of it if you're going to sell it to a third party because A, you want to get rid of your personal data.
10796000	10797000	B, what if that's you in that porn?
10798000	10799000	Most companies have a protocol for removal.
10800000	10801000	Which this company should have done.
10801000	10803000	In words and not in execution.
10804000	10805000	Yeah, but during the Christmas season.
10806000	10810000	But is it, oh, it is a link to a local news story.
10811000	10812000	Of course it's local news.
10813000	10815000	I gotta bring it up here. I gotta see how the local news.
10816000	10818000	If you guys aren't going to call us on Skype, then we're going to entertain ourselves here.
10819000	10820000	You know what's worse?
10821000	10822000	My local news.
10823000	10824000	I actually recognize the station.
10825000	10827000	It's Colorado's local. Denver's local NBC.
10828000	10831000	Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Well, let's see here. I'm going to try to bring this up here in studio real quick.
10832000	10834000	Again, I did not screen this, so we're going to take a look at this.
10835000	10836000	We're doing it live.
10837000	10838000	Yeah, fuck it. We'll do it live.
10839000	10840000	All right, let's see. Where is it? Where's the story?
10841000	10843000	Oh, here it is. Wavy?
10844000	10848000	Davey Wavy News 10 reports on this story. Here it is.
10849000	10852000	W-A-V-Y 10 on your side.
10853000	10855000	Wait, what? That's not...
10855000	10859000	That's what it says. I was going to say W-A-V-Y is not out of Colorado. Is that out of Hampton, Virginia?
10862000	10863000	I don't know what Twitter tweet you saw.
10864000	10866000	Oh, I went back to the previous years.
10867000	10868000	Okay, never mind. Proceed.
10869000	10870000	You all right over there, Jason? You're malfunctioning.
10871000	10872000	No, I just followed the wrong link.
10873000	10877000	All right, let's go to this sensationalist local news report and take a look.
10878000	10879000	I'm hoping there's not an ad here in the front.
10880000	10881000	Of course there's a...
10881000	10891000	They want... It's a hilarious local ad for a car place that's selling tires with Santa shaking his butt there.
10892000	10896000	Oh God, I know which part of Virginia this is. I've been here. All right, here we go.
10897000	10902000	A family in Hampton finds sexual images on their son's new gaming console.
10903000	10906000	They bought it for Christmas. Their son was the first to discover the disturbing images.
10907000	10909000	10 on your side's Jason Marks is investigating...
10909000	10916000	And they bought it for Christmas. I just... The way she singsong that really disturbed me.
10917000	10918000	Jason?
10919000	10923000	Anita, that's the question everyone is asking. How could porn get on a newly bought Nintendo DS?
10924000	10926000	How do people put things on memory codes?
10927000	10932000	How does porn get on something connected to the internet? How does that happen? That blows my mind.
10933000	10936000	Jamie, how does porn get on an internet-enabled device?
10936000	10938000	Because someone owned it before.
10939000	10943000	Oh. Well, why did Channel 10 have to invent... All right.
10944000	10945000	Because they're stupid.
10946000	10947000	Well, to be fair, we haven't seen this the whole way through.
10948000	10949000	No, they're stupid. I looked at it. They're stupid.
10950000	10951000	They're great for us playing this clip on the show.
10952000	10953000	A gift that was meant for an 8-year-old.
10954000	10957000	Normally he would be asking to play on his DS and hasn't yet.
10958000	10963000	Sure. Any kid who just got a Nintendo DS Christmas morning would be chomping at the bit to play the system.
10963000	10968000	But Tom Mayhew's 8-year-old son got an eyeful just after opening his gift.
10969000	10972000	Later on during the day, he went to play his games, not knowing anything was on it.
10973000	10978000	And then after a while, they took a picture of themselves, a couple of the kids that were here.
10979000	10982000	And when the picture was taken, it went to a file.
10983000	10985000	When that file was opened, there was already pictures on it.
10986000	10990000	Not just any pictures, images the Hampton 8-year-old should never see.
10990000	10995000	It was a shocker because we had quite a bit of the family over, so there was a lot of kids here.
10996000	10999000	And the kids were the ones that discovered those pictures.
11000000	11003000	To be fair, I'm going to try to be Devil's advocate a little bit here, although it's difficult.
11004000	11008000	But I mean, I can see where it's not like the pictures are front and center.
11009000	11012000	They are buried a little bit in the 3DS. You do have to go into...
11013000	11015000	The story as he's telling it makes perfect sense.
11015000	11020000	When you open the 3DS, you don't think, oh, I better go in and check all the pictures.
11021000	11026000	So it makes sense that, oh, the kids took the picture, they went to go look at the pictures of themselves in OMG boobs.
11027000	11029000	The story makes sense.
11030000	11033000	And the thing too is they bought it new. It wasn't like they were buying the U-System.
11034000	11035000	So they claim.
11036000	11037000	The text of the article...
11038000	11041000	Well, they bought it from Walmart though, so Walmart doesn't sell U-System.
11042000	11043000	Walmart does open box.
11043000	11045000	Walmart will sell a return.
11046000	11047000	Yeah, absolutely.
11048000	11050000	Is Walmart a target? I can't remember which one. One of those.
11051000	11058000	Well, let's see. Because you know if it's 10 on your side, they're going to go to the store where the manager will refuse to give comment.
11059000	11060000	Because that's what always happens in these stories. So let's see what happens.
11061000	11067000	Or there will be a corporate statement and they'll have the text come up on the screen with the little image of the letter in the background because that's how the local news works.
11068000	11070000	So let's see if my prediction holds out here.
11070000	11076000	Mayu says the DS had a dozen pornographic pictures. Now he wants to know where they came from.
11077000	11078000	Well...
11079000	11080000	Why don't you ask the lady?
11081000	11083000	Well, they could have been internet porno, who knows.
11084000	11091000	...for them to really even be on there. It's disgusting for one. It seems weird that this was the only thing left on it.
11092000	11096000	Mayu first thought it was a Nintendo mistake, but now he has another theory.
11097000	11098000	It's a big mistake.
11098000	11102000	It's important to note that people will think that. They will think...
11103000	11104000	They're dumb.
11105000	11107000	Well, it's not that they're dumb. They just don't know better. There's a big difference.
11108000	11109000	They're ignorant.
11109000	11115000	What was interesting about this before... I immediately discarded this when it said pornographic.
11116000	11128000	But it is known that as a part of QC testing, assembly line workers will take pictures of a unit of themselves or something along the line to make sure that the camera in the batch of systems works.
11129000	11140000	There's a compendium of pictures from iPhones and iPads, iPods, all that kind of stuff, of Chinese factory workers because they're QC-ing the camera during assembly.
11141000	11142000	But not 12 pictures of boobs.
11143000	11145000	Yeah, this is a very different situation.
11146000	11152000	Plus, if you could see the video, they look like internet MySpace blingy images that have boobs. I mean, that's what these things look like.
11153000	11156000	I can't totally tell through the boobs, but this doesn't look like basement...
11156000	11165000	What's even more interesting about that is that means they were downloaded from a site because the DS doesn't have the ability to make those kinds of effects when you take a picture.
11167000	11175000	These were not pictures. Yeah, you can save things, save images from the browser to the SD card or what have you, but it's interesting. It wasn't pictures...
11176000	11180000	It wasn't made by the DS alone. It was actually connected to the internet.
11181000	11183000	Sorry, I let it keep playing. Alright, let me let this finish here.
11183000	11188000	And those things were not deleted from it, so it wasn't a new product. It was a used product.
11189000	11196000	Mayu tells us the pictures were time-stamped in early December. He bought the system here at the Hampton Walmart at 23rd.
11197000	11205000	Here we go. 10 on your side called the corporate office, and we're still waiting to get a call back. As we wait for answers, a father has come up with a question.
11206000	11213000	Oh, so they didn't even get a comment yet. They just called the corporate office and no letter yet. Well, what's Walmart going to say to that?
11214000	11221000	Oh man, clearly an employee was putting boobies on our 3DS. Here's a gift card. Let me let this finish.
11222000	11227000	Mainly is what is my youngest son thinking about those pictures being on there?
11228000	11234000	Dad plans to soon have the talk with his son, a conversation he thought would only come several years from now.
11235000	11238000	He's an eye-opener. Why would those even be on there?
11239000	11247000	Mayu says he found another clue that could show that there was a return system. The Nintendo DS comes with parental controls that require a password.
11248000	11256000	On his DS, the parental controls were already set up, password included. As I mentioned, we're still waiting for Walmart to call us back.
11257000	11259000	I don't remember going through that stuff.
11260000	11262000	Walmart sold a return system as new. That's what they did.
11262000	11269000	Yeah, alright, fine. Thank you. Thank you, Davey Wavy News for the clip there.
11270000	11282000	Well, to be perfectly honest, I think that especially if that was just a re-boxed return, then yeah, he's within his rights to, first of all, request a new system and have that sent back.
11282000	11294000	Because clearly, it's, I'm trying to remember what it is too. You can't sell a used system without marking that it has been used or a refurb.
11295000	11305000	That goes against, I'm trying to remember because I was reading up on the resale law too, just not too long ago. That has to do with truth in advertising.
11305000	11307000	I see that at Fry's all the time.
11308000	11317000	But Fry's will flat out say return. They have a big sticker on it that says this is a return. When you go to any other retailer, it will say refurbished.
11318000	11324000	In the rush of the holidays, that didn't happen at this Walmart and now they're going to get raked through the coals for it.
11325000	11328000	Well, I can't think of a company that deserves it more, but still.
11328000	11335000	Going back to the beginning where this is all at, I hate that these things are considered gaming news because it really has nothing to do with the console.
11336000	11342000	It has nothing to do, but unfortunately, you heard the guy, this is the reality when stories like this come out, you heard the guy there.
11343000	11349000	My first thought was it was something with Nintendo. And all of us that kind of know how these things really work, we saw the punchline coming a mile away.
11350000	11354000	Somebody returned a system that was sold as new. And for all we know-
11355000	11356000	It should be common sense regardless, but-
11356000	11362000	This whole thing was probably a prank, if you think about it. The whole thing was probably a setup.
11363000	11365000	There's probably some assholes watching the news, giggling.
11366000	11367000	Oh yeah, absolutely. The whole thing is probably a setup.
11368000	11369000	We showed that little kid some dick.
11370000	11371000	Which is kind of fucked up in a way.
11372000	11376000	Our plot twist, it was the news station that returned it with the porn on it.
11377000	11378000	For ratings.
11379000	11380000	For ratings.
11381000	11382000	Trying to make some waves.
11383000	11384000	I don't think either of those are the case.
11384000	11385000	What do you think, then?
11386000	11387000	I don't think it was a new system, and I don't think it was intentional.
11388000	11399000	But it was a guy that did something, or perhaps not even a guy, but it was somebody that did something with the system and ultimately didn't want it because they didn't want to have to continue to pay for new things, so they took it back.
11399000	11404000	It was just before- there's a myriad of other possibilities considering it was just before Christmas.
11405000	11411000	I don't- I'm with you on the fact that this isn't gaming news, and this is just tripe.
11412000	11414000	If that's even the correct word to use in this situation, but-
11415000	11416000	This is slow news week news.
11417000	11418000	Alright, fair enough.
11419000	11421000	Alright, well that is gonna do it. I'm gonna close up the Skype line.
11421000	11429000	How sad. I would have thought more of you would want to see our new studio cam on Skype, but I guess I'll have to wait until next week.
11430000	11431000	Act-Def didn't say anything about it either.
11432000	11433000	He was talking about it in chat.
11434000	11438000	I would have thought the first caller would have been like, whoa, I can see you guys now, but we thought-
11439000	11442000	You know, if we get one more caller, I'll even be willing to let it point at me.
11443000	11444000	Too late?
11445000	11450000	It will have to be a 2014 enhancement to the show, except Act-Def got a sneak peek because he was willing to call.
11451000	11456000	We're gonna close up the Skype line, and we're gonna close up shop here at Orange Lawns Radio for the night and for the year.
11457000	11460000	And thank you guys as always for being here. Thank you for listening to the show.
11461000	11466000	Thank you for supporting the show all year long, whether you're new this year or you've been listening for the past eight years.
11467000	11472000	We really appreciate your support. If you like what you hear, please tell a friend or five about the show. Really, really appreciate it.
11473000	11476000	Spread the word about Orange Lawns Radio. That's all we have, is word of mouth.
11477000	11478000	I did have a last minute story real quick.
11479000	11480000	Oh, you do? Okay.
11481000	11482000	Well, go for it.
11483000	11498000	Okay. Apparently at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress, which is a hacker con, they demonstrated that they have cracked the Nintendo Wii U game pad controller to allow streaming of PC content to it.
11499000	11501000	So you can use it almost like Nvidia's shield.
11502000	11503000	Oh, wow.
11503000	11517000	And so it's obviously early and a little bit buggy, but they're releasing code up there to make that happen. Apparently they're building tools to allow that to stream stuff on Windows and OS X.
11518000	11525000	CCC is an amazing collective. They do some fantastic shit. I love them so much. This is great news.
11526000	11528000	Didn't they also crack the Wiimote?
11529000	11545000	I don't remember what name went behind that. If you caught the news about the lifting fingerprints off the phone in order to fake out the iPhone 5S's fingerprint sensor, that was also a CCC project.
11546000	11555000	They are based out of Germany and a coworker of mine has been to a handful of their meetups before. If I ever find myself in Germany, I would love to go.
11556000	11566000	Alrighty. Some thoughts in our chat room. Ragenator saying, here's a thought on the porn story. What are the odds that a parent, probably the dad, was testing out the system before it was wrapped?
11567000	11570000	Forgot that the pics were on the system and when the pics were discovered, the parents tried covering their asses.
11571000	11576000	You know, crazier things have happened in the world, but in this case, I don't really think that's gonna happen.
11577000	11578000	You know what's interesting?
11579000	11580000	My finger slipped on the trigger.
11580000	11585000	Well, the problem too is the date stamp is different. The date stamp is earlier than he purchased it.
11586000	11593000	That's true. Alright, well anyway, we really are gonna wrap up the show. I don't wanna talk, for the first time in my life, I don't wanna talk about porn anymore.
11594000	11596000	Alright, that is gonna do it though for another episode.
11597000	11598000	It's a Christmas miracle!
11599000	11600000	Christmas is over.
11601000	11604000	Here you go, kid. Dick. You get dick for Christmas.
11604000	11606000	Alright, that's it. We're done. We're outta here.
11607000	11609000	Thank you guys so much for supporting the show, and again, tell a friend about the show.
11610000	11611000	We're gonna go around and get final thoughts.
11612000	11614000	Jason, thank you for being here, taking the trek from the Bay Area to be here.
11615000	11617000	I'm hoping we can at least do one show in your neck of the woods at some point.
11618000	11619000	It will be wonderful if it comes to fruition.
11620000	11625000	That's a goal for 2014, one of our goals, a road show. A legit road show, cause we haven't done one in a while.
11626000	11634000	We haven't done one live since OLR was on live 365. I know we did DDR tournaments. I think that was the last time we did a full on live show.
11635000	11636000	I think. Don't quote me on that.
11637000	11640000	I guess the E3s don't count because they were special mini shows during the week and not Sunday shows.
11641000	11647000	Oh! We did the All Games frat house, as I called it.
11648000	11651000	But it was the arena lounge thing they had back in all games.
11651000	11658000	We did do a live show there, during one of the E3s. That would probably be the last time we did a full on show, start to finish, remote.
11659000	11660000	That was a really cool set up.
11661000	11662000	It was only a couple years ago.
11663000	11664000	It was, what, 2006 I think?
11665000	11666000	Like I said, just a couple.
11667000	11668000	That was good memories though.
11669000	11670000	Okay, that's it. We're gonna go around and get final thoughts.
11671000	11672000	Jason, now is your turn. What's your final thought?
11673000	11674000	Merry fucking 2014 people.
11675000	11676000	Good final thought.
11676000	11679000	Loki via the skype line. Your final thought?
11680000	11686000	Looks like Grand Theft Auto 5 is becoming the hacker fest as Grand Theft Auto 4 was.
11687000	11690000	It's supposed to be interesting how they slap the wrists of all these people doing that.
11691000	11692000	I've been hearing that actually.
11693000	11697000	What a shock. I am so shocked that somebody has hacked Grand Theft Auto 5. This is so surprising.
11698000	11701000	We made it so easy. That's the problem.
11701000	11708000	My final thought tonight is, I feel really good. This has been a really good year for the show.
11709000	11713000	One of our best since probably, and I'm not really talking quality. This show is always good.
11714000	11715000	We always try to bring it every week.
11716000	11722000	But just in terms of the growth of the show and everything, this has been probably our best year since podcasting went live.
11723000	11726000	So I just really want to thank everybody again for their support and the new listeners we've got over the year.
11726000	11731000	And just thank you for being a part of our little family here on Sunday nights. Really appreciate it. Thank you.
11732000	11734000	Dark Soccer, last but not least, the final word of 2013.
11735000	11738000	I'm actually going to retire reject false icons because Gorillaz is gone.
11739000	11740000	Did they officially?
11741000	11743000	I think Gorillaz is officially over because Blur is touring again.
11744000	11745000	I see.
11746000	11747000	But I have a new one for you guys.
11748000	11751000	Think before you speak and think before you type.
11752000	11754000	Alright. Think before you speak, think before you type.
11754000	11757000	In other words, don't be an asshole.
11758000	11762000	That's the number one rule of gaming online. Don't be a dick. Unfortunately, way too many people do it.
11763000	11768000	Alright guys, we will see you in 2014. Have a safe new year, whatever it is you're doing.
11769000	11774000	If you are doing any drinking, do not drive. Do not drive. Do not drive. Have your plan to get home.
11775000	11777000	And don't get married if you drink.
11778000	11781000	Don't have a Britney Spears wedding. Don't have sex.
11781000	11784000	Okay, well if you're going to have sex, be safe. Alright, have a great night everybody.
11785000	11788000	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio in 2014. Good night.
