Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, March 17th, 2013, Pokemon is finally set to answer Skylanders, the makers of Super Smash Brothers promised better online in the next game, and worlds collide between Resident Evil 6 and Leopard M2.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 497 for this March the 17th, 2013.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
Happy St. Patrick's Day to you, or Happy Luigi Day as the case may be, cause you know, Luigi wears green.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, gamer lols, anything gamer, and maybe a little bit of other stuff too.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts. Say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Jamie Summers has been replaced by a monster on tonight's show.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
By one of those little gurgly things in WoW.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, the murlocs?

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki, who ate a murloc for dinner.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I, yeah, sort of.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I helped.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
How you doing Loki?

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm doing fine, just making sure I'm being picked up on the mic.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Yes, your mic is good.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Alright.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I don't know what that was about. Random.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
That was Pope Francis actually intervening and hoping that you wouldn't be heard tonight.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
You're gonna be still trying to get rid of that old Pope smell.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Anyhow, say hello. We have a special guest joining us tonight in studio.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
I want to give a big hello and welcome back to an old friend of Orange Lounge Radio, who I haven't seen in a couple months.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
So I'm super excited he took the drive all the way from the Bay Area just to be here with us tonight.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Say hello to Seg.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Hello OLR, I missed you so.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I missed you too.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Would you buy me?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm just kidding.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
How are you?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh, what a year.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
You've had a very interesting year.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
Yes, very much so. A lot of changes, a lot of good things and a lot of not so good things.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Not dead yet, despite the universe's best efforts.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
And it's going to be an exciting year coming up.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Well, let me talk to you a little bit more in just a minute here.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
But I do want to give a plug for our chat room because some of the folks live tonight might want to chat with you, Seg.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
And they can do so by joining our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
In case you didn't know, it is a live show.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
It's a podcast too, but we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network,

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show every Sunday night.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
And if you are in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, you can ask Seg some questions.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
But not everybody might know, like, what y'all have been involved with in the gaming universe.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
So tell us a little bit about yourself for the listeners that might not know.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
So I make video games with computers.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
That's good, as opposed to with sticks and stones.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
Yes. First recipient, just to TLDR my history, first recipient of Bachelor of Fine Arts.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Make sure you're right in that mic so you're good and loud.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
First recipient of Bachelor of Fine Arts in New Media at Emerson College in Boston, originally from Detroit, Dearborn.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
Worked for over five years at Telltale Games, making over 60 titles, more or less.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Episodes are weird.

03:47.000 --> 03:56.000
I also co-founded UMLoud, which is a rock band charity concert in San Francisco and broadcasted around the world for Child's Play Charity.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
And stuff.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
And other things. Is that enough?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
No, it's perfect. That's lots of stuff.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Well, we talk about UMLoud. Let's start with UMLoud, because we've talked a lot about UMLoud on the show.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
And, you know, we've all participated. We've gone to past events and so forth.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
You know, it's a great thing that the whole, you know, Northern California community really gets involved with.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And now, really, the world, too.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Have you been surprised in a positive way at how well UMLoud's been received?

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
It's, you know, it's been, it's such a crazy journey, this thing.

04:33.000 --> 04:46.000
Because, I mean, I first, I was actually one of the first to play Guitar Hero, because I play-tested Guitar Hero 1 way back in the day in Central Square.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
And I always wanted to see an event that focused on performance rather than score.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Because the score didn't really interest me too much, so much as the performance aspect.

04:58.000 --> 05:12.000
And, you know, a few years when I moved over here to California, the opportunity arose to really make an event that focused on performance.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
And to do so in a way that benefited the community.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
And I knew people wanted this sort of event once they figured out, you know, once we were able to communicate this isn't a score-based event.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
Because when you use score, it's always like, oh, there's that one person that's crazy good that'll never beat.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And it just, would just shut off many people.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
Whereas for our event, with the exception of the Headliner program, which is something a little bit special, we don't audition or anything.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Literally any idiot can do it.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Yes.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
That's the beauty of the internet.

05:47.000 --> 05:55.000
And it's just, you know, the first year, we had a few bands that actually did the costume stuff and all that, but that was just the first time doing it.

05:55.000 --> 06:03.000
And now it's just, it's a thing. People pitch me band ideas and all this.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
And just the amount of talent that comes out of it.

06:06.000 --> 06:14.000
And just the creativity and the fervor of excitement that comes out of I Joomloud is just absolutely amazing.

06:14.000 --> 06:25.000
And it wouldn't happen if it weren't for the amazing year-round team that helps put on this show together.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Literally, I mean, it is not just me.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I hate it when people are like, oh, it's your thing.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Like, no, no, no, no, no, it's not my thing.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
It is our thing.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
And, you know, we've been able to raise quite a bit of money.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
How much did you pull in this last year?

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
This last year, we're looking, it's around $41,000 this time around.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah, I remember it was about $40,000, yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah, we got a few things also rolled in late.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
So it's about $41,000.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Not a bad chunk of change.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Not bad. Not bad at all.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
That's for a great cause too.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
It's fun to walk on.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Jamie, of course, you know, I know did a lot of graphic design and stuff for it.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
So, yeah, it's a fun way for everybody to get involved.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
Do you have a lot of people that are kind of throwing themselves at you going, let me help?

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, you know, once we get, you know, we're definitely going to be expanding more this year.

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
We really want to expand the headliner program, which was a wild success this year.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
To explain what that is, so Umlaut to Perform, it's a donation.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
Last year was $200 last year for a band package.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And you split that between your band members.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
So it's not that much at all.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
It's $200 a band, but if your band has, what, seven people, three vocalists?

07:46.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah, you know, we have an upper limit of seven just to help manage the stuff, you know, the cards and all that and all that.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
But it's, it doesn't have to be seven.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
So you can't be like Gwar, getting up and having a big cup.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Well, you can't be, well, you know, there's a stage limit as well.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
But, well, like one of the bands, this is one of the headliners, French Kiss,

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
incorporated other friends that had confetti poppers everywhere.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
And we earned our cleaning fee this year with them.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
Oh, man, just confetti everywhere.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
How's the response from the people who can't be there in person?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Have you found that your internet presence has really grown?

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
We had a real boon with a partnership with Twitch.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
They featured us on the website and that just shot up.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
And also with Tim Schafer hosting was definitely an attraction.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
How did you, that's, thank you for reminding me of that because that was quite the feature for Umlaut this year.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
How did you manage that?

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, Joe had already worked with Tim Schafer and his team, Joe Market.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
He's one of the co-founders, one of the fellow co-founders and board members.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
And he had already worked with him on the GDC awards and all that.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
And we were looking for a host and he did the co-found.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Hey, would you be interested in this?

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
And they were, you know, he was, and we had him host our show.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Awesome.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah.

09:17.000 --> 09:27.000
I mean, we kept that under wraps for quite a few months because we wanted it to be Tim Schafer's hosting and here's where you buy tickets.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
Here's a great question for somebody that's been in the industry as long as you have since you brought up keeping secrets.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
And you've worked, you know, you worked for Telltale for many years and obviously they had some huge games over those years.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
You have to keep a lot of secrets when you work in this industry.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
How hard is that?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Very.

09:43.000 --> 09:54.000
The worst, the hardest secret I ever had to keep was keeping from my sister, Carolyn, the fact that we were working on Tales of Monkey Island.

09:54.000 --> 10:03.000
That was the hardest because my sister and I grew up on the scum era and I leaned more towards the Sam and Max.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
She leaned more towards the Monkey Island side.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
But, you know, there's definitely shared love between the two.

10:10.000 --> 10:18.000
But I had to keep that secret for much longer than I would have liked.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
And I certainly heard about it from her.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I bet. I bet.

10:24.000 --> 10:32.000
I told her a half hour before we were going live with the announcement just so I could say that I told her before.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
But if you guys have 30 minutes before, that's great.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
If you guys have questions for SEG, live.vognetwork.com, you can ask whatever you'd like, within reason.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Either about UMLOUD or A Space Between Studios or whatever.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
I do want to talk about your new studio, but I had another quick question about UMLOUD because I know this has got to be something that's on your mind.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
It's on a lot of people's mind when it comes to rock band.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
They've announced no more DLC after, what is it, two weeks?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
It's like the last DLC we're ever going to see.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Which, you know, the end had to happen at some point, right?

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
It's hard to be upset about the end of rock band DLC when no other game in the history of gaming has been supported the way the rock band has been.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah, five years.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Let's be real.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And with as much as they've got, right?

11:17.000 --> 11:25.000
So, are you worried, though, that like, uh-oh, if this means that rock band is sunsetting, what's going to happen to UMLOUD?

11:25.000 --> 11:34.000
Well, you know, this whole shinding does not happen if not for the support of the community.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
And that's ultimately what everyone comes together for.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
That's what this whole thing happens, is the community.

11:43.000 --> 11:51.000
And I see no slowing down from the community of wanting to do this event.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
So, that's what I point to, not just to blindly say, oh, yeah, we're still going to do it.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
No, the evidence of all the people that just want to pour in all the performances who just...

12:04.000 --> 12:16.000
To me, our marketing challenge for our event is getting people to experience for the first time UMLOUD, whether it's online or in person.

12:16.000 --> 12:23.000
Because we know that once people experience it, they're coming back next year or really heavily regretting it.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
So, we know we have a very good event on our hands.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
We know we have an event that people love, that people want to participate in.

12:31.000 --> 12:39.000
And harmonics moving on from rock band hasn't altered that.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
So, maybe it'll be a dance party with Dance Central in a couple years.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Surely you've kicked that idea around.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
We've kicked the idea, yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Obvious conclusion, right?

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
I mean, it's hard to do that on stage because, well, for one, it's only two people.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
And then it's not a main stage thing.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
And we really want to push as many bands and people on stage just because we're only doing it one night.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
We want to make sure that we get as many people to experience the big stage.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
It really is the performance of it all, too.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
And it's funny that if you look back at the history of this show, we started around, what, DDR?

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
We used to do episodes of this show live from Dance Dance Revolution tournaments and stuff.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
So, let me tell you, they'll always be somewhere in gaming, like a performance game.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I think we've seen that ever since, really.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I guess DDR probably was the first of that that I could think of.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
It was a performance-based game.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I want to see a visual K-themed band next year.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
That's my personal challenge out to anybody, by the way.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Anything is possible.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
I try not to meddle in the affairs of bands, but I just want to put out there,

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
I would love to see someone do a mash-up and or a Weird Al rendition of a song.

13:52.000 --> 14:02.000
Because the game's on no-fail, and you don't worry about score anyways.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
I wish people would explore the space.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
That's what we do at my house.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah, I've seen people do, because Born This Way, right?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
So you can do the whole, like, perform this way.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
You can totally do it.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
It's good times.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Isn't Lola in there?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Because I think we've done Yoda.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Perhaps.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
What else do I want to ask about?

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
Oh, one other question I got about Umlaut, and then I want to talk about some of your other projects, too.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Do you get people, since you have had success on the internet,

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
and you're recognized on Twitch as a national thing now, it's not just something that's NorCal,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
do you get people coming to you going,

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
Segg, how do I have an Umlaut in Tallahassee, Florida?

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Or how do I do an Umlaut in Titicaca?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
There's definitely a request for that.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Bring Umlaut to me.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
There's sort of two prongs to that answer.

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
As far as the Umlaut branding, we don't know exactly how to, for us under the Umlaut brand,

15:03.000 --> 15:15.000
to franchise and do it in such a way that we can ensure that the quality and the organization is up to our standards

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
to make sure that things are above orders.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
It's not that I imagine people being shady about it, but it's not something we can just go,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Oh, yeah, I'll use the Umlaut brand and all that.

15:28.000 --> 15:36.000
So we're protective on it because we want to make sure we do it right if we branch out with the Umlaut brand.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
But not like you need us, either.

15:41.000 --> 15:50.000
It all comes down to, do you have enough people and enough partnerships you can start to make a thing together

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
and to rent out a place?

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
And if you have enough of a community around to pull out the rock band and make it happen.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
It's more event planning than the rock band part because, believe me,

16:06.000 --> 16:13.000
as the sound techs at DNA Lounge, where we have our event, have told me we're one of the easier shows to tech.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I bet.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
Yeah, it's microphones and looped back and the monitors, but the rest of the instruments.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
That part's the easiest, right?

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Well, yeah, and you know, it's funny because we get this, even here at Orange Ons Radio,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
we're coming up on our 500th episode in a few weeks, right?

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
So a lot of people are like, Hey, you guys should have an OLR Con or a VoG network to do a VoG Con or something like that.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
I'm like, do you know what it takes to plan a convention?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
It would not be pretty.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Like the better idea is to take it like Fonami.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Hey, don't you want like an OLR night or something?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Yeah.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Try to leash on to something else.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
That's the only way it's going to happen.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
I think part of a first gen con, its first ever, it was called Ground Zero Con in Mobile, Alabama.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
It was held in.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
It's Christmas at Ground Zero.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
No, not that one.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
It was, my friend had this like gaming group called Ground Zero Techno Mage.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Okay.

17:09.000 --> 17:17.000
And he ran a con in the theater room in the school's student center.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
But everything's got to start somewhere. It'd be little, but you know, it's possible.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Yeah.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
I think he started it with 200 bucks.

17:23.000 --> 17:31.000
The proto umlaut was actually Fuendrauser, which was in a bar, 200 capacity.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
And I didn't get involved, but I went to it and that packed the place up.

17:35.000 --> 17:43.000
And that's like, okay, if they have advertising able to get that many people rolling in, and then it was a scale up from there.

17:43.000 --> 17:50.000
If that was all umlaut ever was, now obviously it's turned into something bigger, but even if it's just that, you're still raising money for a good cause.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Exactly.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
So why not, why not dream a little bigger?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
All right.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Speaking of dream big, you started your own game studio.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Yeah.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Okay.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
No pressure.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Okay.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
You were at Telltale.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Layoffs happen in the industry.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
It doesn't matter who you work for, right?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
These types of things happen.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
So you worked on, did you work on Walking Dead?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Yes.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
So that's got to feel real good though, that you were a part of that because that was such a huge success, right?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:50.000
Working through the years and building up the studio and really having all of us really come to a point where we're really recognized for our work is just a testament to the years of dedication we all put in to make that go.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
So, you know, there's that old saying, when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade.

18:54.000 --> 19:01.000
So you certainly have done that in some regard with this whole thing because, you know, unfortunately you took that bad news that happened there.

19:01.000 --> 19:08.000
And you know, that's just an inevitable fact of that industry, unfortunately, is that, you know, as projects come and go, people come and go, right?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
We've reported it.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
How many times on this show?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
How many times on this show?

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
But here we are now, you know, that'll happen at the end of last year.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And now here we are March of this year.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
And you're like, okay, I'm not going to be the type that just sits on my butt and watches Oprah all day.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I'm going to.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Oprah's off the air.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
She has a network now.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
What's the line when life gives you lemons, you demand to see life's manager.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
But you've turned that into a game studio.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
So where how did that did you just did you wake up one day and go, you know, I should start a game studio.

19:41.000 --> 19:48.000
Well, I should really talk more about the project and, you know, the studio kind of comes after that a little bit.

19:48.000 --> 19:58.000
And I wanted to, you know, after the layoff, I was thinking of why why I love video games so much.

19:58.000 --> 20:05.000
Why why I've dedicated my my life, my career to video games and all that.

20:05.000 --> 20:19.000
And I've I've had this idea floating around of making a a a project that explained how video games communicate as an art form.

20:19.000 --> 20:30.000
And it's you know, I mean, I went through school for it and actually kind of made my own curriculum because I was the first person to go through my program.

20:30.000 --> 20:51.000
And there's a lot of things that we know, but no one, you know, very few have really pinned it down, put some definitions onto it, put some context on it and delivered in a way that a general public would actually participate, you know, like play playthrough and all that.

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
So I wanted to make a video game, a video games, trying to wrap my head around this idea a lot.

20:58.000 --> 21:05.000
I know we talk about like artistic video games. We think a lot about like Flower and Journey and other things that that game company have done.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
The art in that maybe even like so much the art of storytelling in a game like Walking Dead.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Certainly it affected a lot of people and it's storytelling.

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
So what's what's the difference between like a artsy video game? Because that's not what you're talking about.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You're not talking about making an artsy video game.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
You're talking about making a video game that tell like.

21:25.000 --> 21:39.000
I'm trying to wrap my head. Well, think of think, you know, in high school or in college, you know, there are film appreciation classes like a film appreciation one on one class where, you know, that class you're walking in there.

21:39.000 --> 21:58.000
You know, there's it's not like you haven't experienced film before, but those classes are to bring some terminology and some understanding and perspective about how artists use this particular form of media to communicate ideas.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
I want to make the video games appreciation one on one class.

22:02.000 --> 22:12.000
And rather than making it a book where I would be going like, oh, this concept, like in this game, assuming you played that game.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
But if you're going in for a video game appreciation textbook, you know, you can assume that they haven't played that particular game.

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
So rather, I wanted to make a game. So instead of just textually writing about it and talking about it and all that, it's like, no, here is the concept.

22:27.000 --> 22:34.000
Let's put it out in front of you. Let's have you experience it the way it's intended to in that form of media.

22:34.000 --> 22:40.000
So you can actually really get a deep understanding by doing rather than wrote.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
So this is the game that will make Roger Ebert understand.

22:43.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah, you know, I'm trying not. Well, I will say that I'm not the piece won't spend much time of, you know, trying to prove, you know, answer the question, is video games art?

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Because it's just simply, yes, they are. Let's move on.

22:58.000 --> 23:07.000
That's that's that's the opinionated opinion I'm starting with this piece of just like, yes, there are. Let's go into it.

23:07.000 --> 23:14.000
So you know, you know, the result you want. How do you how we how are we going to get there?

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Good question.

23:17.000 --> 23:28.000
So I have a few people that are working on it sort of part time and part part time on it.

23:28.000 --> 23:37.000
I have Jessica Johnson being a writer for me and being sort of the foil and keeping me into focus of the actual content of it.

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
I have Dan as a programmer that's very interested in working with me on the project.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
But really, it comes down to is funding, to be quite honest.

23:48.000 --> 23:54.000
And the bugger about this kind of project is I usually when you go out for funding for a game and all that,

23:54.000 --> 24:05.000
when you're doing it professionally, air quotes, is that you say, well, here's similar games that we're trying to make.

24:05.000 --> 24:12.000
And here was their return on investment. Here's where their profitability and here's where we're going to twist and make something different.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
I don't have any game to point to that is anywhere similar to this.

24:18.000 --> 24:27.000
No one has made the real the video game about video games to the kind of depth and length that I'm searching for with this piece.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
So it turns me to do the inevitable Kickstarter.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
I was going to ask because, yeah, we like a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to ask you.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
But now that we're in 2013, is Kickstarter the answer for this?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
That currently is my answer.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Or Indiegogo or any of those.

24:43.000 --> 24:54.000
I'm doing Kickstarter because I want to if I'm doing this, I want to do it in a way that actually funds the game.

24:54.000 --> 25:05.000
And that's going to be six figures easy because I want to respect the people that are going to work on this for me.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
And that means paying them decently.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
So it ends up being a six figure.

25:10.000 --> 25:18.000
The figure and Indiegogo is just not producing those kinds of adult results consistently.

25:18.000 --> 25:25.000
There is a branding of Kickstarter that you can't dismiss.

25:25.000 --> 25:33.000
I mean, sure, I would love to have, you know, some capital investment come in, swoop down and make it go.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
But barring that, I really need to prove that there's an audience for this.

25:39.000 --> 25:46.000
And really the available way to do that in this case, I believe, is through Kickstarter.

25:46.000 --> 25:53.000
Because then I can say here are these people who actually put money down to that actually want to have this thing happen.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
How are you how are you preparing for this Kickstarter?

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
So, you know, it's a lot of, you know, this budget for one.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
I have a spreadsheet that is so dynamic.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Well, thank God you've had to do some financial planning for UMLoud in the past.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Yeah, I know, right?

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
You're not going into this totally blind.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Yeah.

26:12.000 --> 26:20.000
You know, I have quite a bit of experience of doing budgets and all that.

26:20.000 --> 26:29.000
And I have to say that I've had a really good business teacher and that's my father or Uncle Ed to you.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Hi, Dad.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
I think I see him in chat.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah.

26:33.000 --> 26:40.000
He had a comment earlier in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com about Tim Schafer at UMLoud and that he was a great addition to UMLoud this year.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
And Uncle Ed is a great addition to UMLoud.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
He does the books and everything, among many other things.

26:49.000 --> 26:56.000
But anyway, but he is a former Ford employee.

26:56.000 --> 27:07.000
And I learned I learned enough about business to go about knowing enough about business to know when I need an adult.

27:07.000 --> 27:26.000
And which, man, that's a bit, you know, through the years, really realizing how special and unique that is, because, boy, we all have seen people who really don't know how to business and don't understand for themselves.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Heck yeah.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
There's been so many moments during the times of OLR in the past where, you know, we're trying to do something.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
It's like, I need an adult.

27:36.000 --> 27:51.000
So, you know, I'm not going in this completely blindly, but so that, you know, there's making the budget and figure out, OK, how much you know, how much is needed, what is going to be the markup of Kickstarter fees and credit card fees and all that.

27:51.000 --> 28:04.000
And then the fulfillment fees of the actual prizes and all that, that run down from how much is bandwidth going to cost to deliver on final thing to all the physical items, what's good, what's not good.

28:04.000 --> 28:19.000
You know, and trying to balancing all those numbers so that if this thing gets green lighted, I'm not going, well, I have these thousands of dollars worth of stuff I have to pay for in order to get to people.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Well, crap.

28:21.000 --> 28:29.000
You may not have the answer to this question yet, but let me try to throw it out there anyway, just because this is the question that people will be asking once this goes live.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
But, you know, why am I going to want to donate to this?

28:33.000 --> 28:39.000
Why will I want to donate and help space between studios create this game?

28:39.000 --> 29:02.000
What this game is intending to do is be the community's way of illustrating to the rest of the world why video games, why we love video games in the way and why we think video games is unique as a form of art that communicates ideas.

29:02.000 --> 29:17.000
And to answer that in the way of what makes video games work to communicate ideas, why are we attracted to the things that we like about video games?

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
Why are we dissuade about the things that don't work about video games?

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
Will you be able to answer the question why we've been sitting here for the past 11 years every Sunday night talking about this crap?

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
Well, you know, that's more in the psychology.

29:30.000 --> 29:37.000
And that was the nice way of saying nobody can answer that.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
That would be an exercise.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
That would be a true exercise in recursive thinking.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
I'm sorry.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
He's a game designer, not a head doctor.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
I didn't mean to make it about us.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
It's about us.

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
It's on our show about that.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
But no, this is this is this is also a piece.

29:59.000 --> 30:06.000
I mean, we don't have this fully fleshed out as far as the outline, because I also want to hear from the community at large.

30:06.000 --> 30:22.000
And this is development and players of what are the things about video games we would want to communicate to people who may not know or play video games all that well, but have an interest just to know more.

30:22.000 --> 30:34.000
And not and I don't think throwing people to a particular any one particular game is going to begin to answer what the diaspora of video games are.

30:34.000 --> 30:46.000
So this is going to be a piece that is a sort of neutral ground where it doesn't make an assumption of what experience level and what you've played before.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
That's both in the not played before or super experience.

30:49.000 --> 30:57.000
I'm not making initial assumptions of audience that way will customize based off of how you approach things.

30:57.000 --> 31:08.000
We'll take those creative choices there, but really want to present something that that we can go, hey, oh, you want to know more about video games?

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
You just just get this game and play and then we'll talk about it after.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
And if you really want to know, it's going to cost you because we hear gamers love microtransactions.

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
Oh, no, no, I'm not doing that now.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah, I do.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Will your game be always online required?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
No.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Get out now.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
All right.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
No, I, you know, well, I'll have the game that's DRM free.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
Windows, Linux, Mac.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
You know, no.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Is it coming to the OUYA?

31:43.000 --> 31:58.000
Well, you know, that's the other plan, you know, other consoles and platforms and definitely not saying no to I'm sticking to the big three desktop platforms because I can 100 percent promise that 100 percent go and all that.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
We are using Unity, so it's not gating other platforms outright.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
It's just I'd rather promise things we can deliver on.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
And it's not that I mean, there are other avenues that I am exploring.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Sure.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
I just know that I want to promise.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Don't second, don't write checks.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Your ass can't cash.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Right. I heard that before.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
All right.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
It's not like I'm mentioning that Minecraft will be on a dot, dot, dot.

32:24.000 --> 32:30.000
If I'm torn on whether to ask you this question or not, because this question can be perceived as a negative from our chat room.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
But I think it's a tough question.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
And I've been through worse.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm going to say if you're going to take it to the Internet, you're going to get this.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
So let me ask you this question from Ross.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Do you see in the chat room that says so.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
So this is a testament to the community's insecurity and need for approval.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Are gamers insecure?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Well, no, it's not it's not a statement.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
I'm sorry.

32:51.000 --> 33:00.000
It's not the impression of just gamers need to themselves need to like defend or whatever.

33:00.000 --> 33:08.000
It's just there hasn't been a really good academic text that's approachable.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Could this be a celebration?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Yes.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Of gaming.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
It's a celebration of gaming.

33:13.000 --> 33:21.000
I mean, I'm making my pitch a little bit geared towards more of people who have played games, because I think if you're listening to this show, I can make that assumption.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
That's that's a good.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Yeah.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Good way of thinking.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Yeah.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Just say it.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Just, you know, no judging.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
But, you know.

33:28.000 --> 33:37.000
Well, going back to the academic approach, though, what about having it as a tool for like, say, officials, you know, people who are making those legislation about.

33:37.000 --> 33:44.000
Well, I don't want to I don't want the piece to become an out and out political tool.

33:44.000 --> 33:52.000
I'm making very, very consciously not going into topical things or even current topics that I'm including.

33:52.000 --> 34:02.000
Like, for example, I'm not going to touch behavior of online chat and XBLA and all that.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Comment threads on the Internet.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Because that's not there's nothing artistic.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
Just keep Tumblr out of it because all anyone does is talk about Mass Effect.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
But like, you know, like I'm bringing that up.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
It's not even so much like this is a text of the community.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
This is not a text.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
This is just how video games communicate as an art form.

34:23.000 --> 34:46.000
But to to that end, as tools, one of the plans I have for the the Kickstarter tier reward tiers is you get a digital copy, but you can pick a library classroom, whatever academic it's, you know, whatever can be leaving a little bit broad.

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
You know, some people if people come up with something that we haven't thought about that would fit in their community, community service, community service, whatever.

34:52.000 --> 35:03.000
But a kit that's so far speccing us to physical DVDs, a site license documentation saying, yes, this institution has a site license for the game.

35:03.000 --> 35:15.000
So it's not limited to the two physical copies and two physical copies of the softcover handbook that we're also going to produce as a sort of companion piece with it.

35:15.000 --> 35:26.000
And that's a you know, you get the thing, but then you can send out a thing and that's going to be on the little on the little more upper range because that's an expensive share, you know, more expensive than a digitally downloadable thing.

35:26.000 --> 35:35.000
But, you know, I am putting the cut ins for library in that educational text, but I'm also not trying to make this edutainment.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
You know, this isn't just the pure academic. I'm trying to make I'm trying to take the approach.

35:40.000 --> 35:58.000
This is actually more speaking to where I want to go in a studio perspective is I want to take my my approach of how I've approached all of these licensed properties and all that that I worked in and telltale and all that.

35:58.000 --> 36:07.000
Where I take this canon from strong bad and, you know, it has it has this very well documented wiki, which was such a boon.

36:07.000 --> 36:27.000
I have to say that the Homestar Wiki helped out so much by taking the approach and care I've done to all these fictional franchises and take that same approach, but to non fictional things where the canon is reality.

36:28.000 --> 36:41.000
So and understanding video games is the piece that is my first piece in in that approach, because what I guess for the most part when it comes to edutainment or serious games,

36:42.000 --> 36:59.000
I'm not trying to make a complete blanket statement, but it just there just seems to be this disconnect of all the all the rich development and decisions being made on fictional games that are wonderful and awesome.

36:59.000 --> 37:06.000
But it's just not transferring over to other fields and other things that just that would really benefit from it.

37:06.000 --> 37:18.000
And this is sort of my my particular answer to try and give the perspective of we don't necessarily need to do straight straight up fiction work with our art form.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.000
Well, you've got quite quite a path ahead of you until you get to the end.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
I do kind of want to wrap up so you move on, talk about the weekend news.

37:27.000 --> 37:34.000
But if somebody wants to keep tabs on your project, on the Kickstarter, that'll be coming eventually, how can they do that?

37:34.000 --> 37:41.000
Spacebetweenstudios.com and it has all the social media, blah, blah, blah.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
The Twitters, the Facebooks.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
The Twitters, the Facebooks, the Google Plus even, because why not?

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
And oh, no, Harrison's there?

37:53.000 --> 37:59.000
What's up, Harrison? Sorry, I'm totally reading Chad and totally distracting myself. Damn you, Harrison.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
It took us forever. We used to do the same thing. It would be like our show would be us reading the chat.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
Yeah, well, I'm just seeing and Bobby going Harrison.

38:09.000 --> 38:16.000
I would actually love SAG because there are there is kind of like a spirited debate going on about, you know, what what is what is the purpose of this?

38:16.000 --> 38:23.000
So I would love for you to get actually read your chat room after after we're done talking here and we get into the news.

38:23.000 --> 38:29.000
But so Spacebetweenstudios.com and on the Twitters and all that stuff.

38:29.000 --> 38:35.000
I know this is probably so early, but I'd be made fun of if I didn't ask this as a commentator.

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
Any idea on the time frame? Any time, time assuming Green Line and everything.

38:40.000 --> 38:48.000
If if the Kickstarter passes, passes and I'm able to be solvent on that, I'm currently looking at it.

38:48.000 --> 38:59.000
Well, it'd be ambitious if I said December 2014, but it's probably going to be January 2015 for digital release.

38:59.000 --> 39:08.000
And I'm purposefully putting a two month block of the physical releases of stuff because I want to make sure things are.

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
Completely bug free.

39:13.000 --> 39:22.000
Before I meant the final physical disks or anything, but everyone would get the digital when it's, you know, I'm not spinning hairs there.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
Well, good luck.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I'll need it.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
I, I, I, I am so I just want to I can't wait to just see it.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
You know what I mean? Like, it's it's one thing to kind of hear you describe it.

39:35.000 --> 39:41.000
And then I'm kind of like, I just can't wait to kind of like jumping because there is so, you know, when you think about it, less like a celebration.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I mean, you know what we're talking about here.

39:43.000 --> 39:50.000
I mean, this this show, my life would be dramatically different if video games didn't exist.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
Right. And, you know, I'm sure we all have that story of mom growing up saying you keep playing those games.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
You'll never amount to anything. Isn't that right, Uncle Ed?

39:58.000 --> 40:06.000
Now, well, video video games have helped you raise over the years, probably one hundred thousand dollars at this point for charity.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
Right. Over the five. We're at 40.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
OK, well, it's about I'm going to say 80K.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
I mean, regardless, a huge number.

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
And that is because of your love of video games, our love for video games.

40:21.000 --> 40:33.000
You know, wanting to perform that, wanting to, you know, show the community gamers aren't just crazy people on Xbox with guns that shoot children.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
You know, that's not what gamers are at all.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
The the one point I do want to make and then we can actually continue on.

40:40.000 --> 40:48.000
When with the Kickstarter and all that, I I am and you can you can you can hold me to the fire in this.

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
You when we go into development with this, you are going to hear from us constantly.

40:54.000 --> 41:01.000
We're going to make sure we do at least once a month general like, you know, what what we did in the past month thing.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
But it's also trying to be available in forums and all that.

41:04.000 --> 41:12.000
So we're not going to be one of those kickstarters that, like, don't say anything for a few months and everyone's like, ah.

41:12.000 --> 41:20.000
You know, so we and this piece won't exist if it won't if the community doesn't participate with it.

41:20.000 --> 41:29.000
So, you know, this isn't I mean, also, you know, yes, ultimately we make final decisions with the piece, but it is not going to be in a vacuum.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
It is going to need everyone else's participation.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
I love these comments in the chat room. I've got I've got to read these before we move on.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I haven't been looking. Sorry, John.

41:38.000 --> 41:44.000
Harrison Pink in our chat room, H.G. Pink says, everyone back say he's a smart guy who loves games and won't steal from you.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Oh, thank you, Harrison. I miss you, man.

41:46.000 --> 41:51.000
Uncle Ed just defending himself a little bit in chat. So I think it's fair to read this.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
I gave you the TRS 80 in the early 80s. Your mother's the one that had issues with it.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
That's why I was saying like that. That was like that's why I met with that comment.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
Is that right? That mom said that Uncle Ed.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Fair enough. Fair enough. All right.

42:05.000 --> 42:14.000
Well, again, best of luck to you, not just with Space Between Studios, but with UMLoud, you know, going into this year and whatever else may come.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
You will be a PAX East as an attendee.

42:16.000 --> 42:23.000
I am a crazy person because I'm doing PAX this week.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
We leave hopefully Tuesday. Apparently this is going to be fun time weather, so we'll see.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
But Tuesday, Sin and I will be going to Boston.

42:31.000 --> 42:41.000
And it's bless Sin, her birthday is Wednesday and I'm throwing her a birthday party in Boston to which she knows no one there.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
She has never met anyone there because she doesn't know anyone in Boston.

42:44.000 --> 42:50.000
There's one friend from her from here that's also coming along with like everyone else is like, meet my friends.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Parties with strangers can be the best kind.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
Yes, they can. But so so I'll be at PAX this weekend.

42:57.000 --> 43:04.000
I think I make it make a sign that says, ask me about video games and park myself somewhere and see what happens.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
Why not? Yeah, exactly. It works for the free hugs guy. I know. Right.

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
And then you're going to GDC and then GDC because I'm I'm a crazy person and I get back the Monday.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
I mean, GDC starts Monday, but I have the Wednesday through Friday pass.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
But apparently there's stuff I can go to on the Tuesday.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
So I'm going to go to the it's like the Facebook day and the Google day.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
It's all these sponsored ones and I figured, hey, with Pocky, come equipped with Pocky.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
Why? You are right. Free candy.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
You can be a stranger with candy. Yes.

43:39.000 --> 43:46.000
OK, so and by the way, just, you know, Uncle Ed said in chat, ouch, she just hit me.

43:46.000 --> 43:51.000
There you go. That's that's hilarious. Well, have fun at PAX East, have fun at GDC.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
So apparently, if the listeners want to say hi to you at PAX East, talk to you in person about this.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
Look for the guy who has the sign that says, ask me about video games.

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
Perfect. I'm sure at some point you will find the VOG contingent, Bobby Blackwell.

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
I'm sure they'll find me. They'll find you. Absolutely. Absolutely. Let's be realistic here.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
There is a social media that I think you should add to the list. Tumblr.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
Oh, God. Oh, oh, there is much wank on Tumblr, but much spreading of information.

44:20.000 --> 44:26.000
Don't I'm not hating on Tumblr. I'm not I would never want to incur that wrath.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
But Tumblr is almost all social media for Tumblr. Tumblr is a very interesting place.

44:30.000 --> 44:36.000
I love the gifts. Yeah, there's a few people I thought friends that I follow on on the Tumblr.

44:36.000 --> 44:41.000
I do not have a Tumblr. I say thanks again for being here tonight.

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
And you will stay and talk about the week in news. Of course, because I have opinions.

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
Excellent. All right. So let's talk about our gaming week. So we'll move a little quickly tonight because we are.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
Because I talk forever. You know what? You know what?

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
You earned it. All right. Dark soccer. How was your game? What the crap else do I play?

45:01.000 --> 45:06.000
Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. Because I was actually playing around with modding Mass Effect 2.

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
I love that that BioWare is like, yeah, go ahead. Mod it all you want. E a patch.

45:11.000 --> 45:19.000
Damn it. So, yeah, I've been playing a lot of a lot more Mass Effect and a little bit more to the moon.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
Because that game is absolutely. Just it causes the feels to happen.

45:24.000 --> 45:31.000
It makes the feels happen and they hurt. And then I've been looking at a few other things.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
But honestly, my job right now is going to the gym and looking for a job.

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
So. Yeah, that's about it. Well, then we'll move on to Loki.

45:41.000 --> 45:47.000
How was your gaming week? Actually, I've been playing a ton of Saints Row the third, ironically enough.

45:47.000 --> 45:55.000
And so I started playing again with my coworker, which probably getting that pretty soon because he's leaving.

45:55.000 --> 46:04.000
We've been playing co-op on 360 with the full package and actually haven't really been playing a DLC because it sucks.

46:04.000 --> 46:09.000
But main game. And so we've been messing around with that a little bit.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
And then on PC, I, you know, finally got my car.

46:14.000 --> 46:21.000
Well, I had my copy since that THQ sale on the humble indie bundle, THQ bundle.

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
And so I've been playing a heavily modded version of the game,

46:26.000 --> 46:32.000
mainly just so I get the additional cheat that was actually missing from the console version, which was the evil car code.

46:32.000 --> 46:38.000
I love the evil car code from the other games. And I was really sad when it wasn't in Saints Row the third.

46:38.000 --> 46:46.000
But apparently there was a lot of rushing on that game. And so a lot of the features that they would have put in there got cut.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
So I've been playing with that and having actually quite a bit of fun with it.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
And going through and just trying to get all my achievements and stuff on the Steam version.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
And hopefully going to do the same on the console version because I've been trying to finish missions differently.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
Because I lost my save that I had. I had an in-game save with almost everything done.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
And sure enough, I don't know where it is. So.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
You need to save your games in the cloud.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
Oh, fuck that. I am not saving shit in the cloud.

47:17.000 --> 47:24.000
But clearly gamers want their saves in the cloud because they keep losing them.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
That's what gamers want. We're hearing gamers loud and clear on what they want.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
In the cloud. You know what I used to call the cloud? The internet!

47:32.000 --> 47:37.000
That's what it is. It's a fucking internet, okay? You're saving it to a server somewhere else, okay?

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
Why would I want to do that when I can just save it to a memory card that I know where the fuck it is?

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
Oh, and hey, if the internet's down, guess what? My save still works because it's on a memory card.

47:47.000 --> 47:52.000
And not in the fucking cloud. So, no, I'm fine not saving to the cloud.

47:52.000 --> 47:58.000
Although I do have one cloud save right now. It's my old Minecraft save for Xbox Live Arcade.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
I actually agree with you. I turn off all of my cloud storage stuff.

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
I am thinking about taking it out because I hate having the second option pop up all the time for saves.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
I turn it on. It's not hurting anything.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
What I don't like about it is that sometimes it overwrites some of my save files on Mass Effect.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Oh, well, I can see that.

48:14.000 --> 48:19.000
So, yeah, I've been playing that and then a little Call of Duty. I'm still, you know, playing Call of Duty.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
If that's it, then Seg, how about you? What have you been playing?

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
What do you play when you're not designing and all this other stuff?

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
And moving, because I also moved.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
I've been slowly getting back to Team Fortress 2.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
I say as I wear my Mann Co. shirt.

48:37.000 --> 48:46.000
And I used to play on 242 Furious, which is just a crazy server.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
But Floormaster, I guess, closed it down. I don't know what happened there.

48:49.000 --> 48:54.000
So, I'm trying to find a new permanent home for a server. So, I'm shopping around there.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Any Team Fortress players want to adopt a Seg?

48:56.000 --> 49:09.000
Yes, I have. So, it's funny when I play Team Fortress 2, because I have the rarest, most sought-after item that wasn't the gold wrench in TF2.

49:09.000 --> 49:19.000
I have a self-made Max hat, because everyone that was working on Telltale at the time, when we were releasing Season 3 of Sam and Max,

49:20.000 --> 49:26.000
we all got the self-made Max hat, so it sparkles, because I'm fabulous.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
That was my role on this show.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
You've just been out-fabbed.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
And it's funny, because I'll play, and then someone will go like,

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
Dude, there's someone with the self-made. And we're like, dude, why is your hat sparkling?

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
Or, dude, can I trade for your hat?

49:47.000 --> 49:53.000
Yes, random internet stranger. I am going to trade the most rarest hat ever to...

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
I'm going to assume they just don't know how rare it is, or something. I don't know.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
The ones that asked do. And they're that dumb.

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
They actually took out the tradable flag, so I can't even trade if I wanted to.

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
Because there were other problems that happened. Like, someone's account got hacked for it.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
So they just clamped that down.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Over a freaking hat!

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
I know!

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
People like their E-peen.

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
Why do you think it went free-to-play? It still makes money.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
And I don't blame Valve at all for it.

50:29.000 --> 50:35.000
And especially since they're doing it in such a way that's much more open than they could've.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
Or that they didn't need to.

50:38.000 --> 50:45.000
I mean, there was a story a few weeks ago that Newell was talking that they had to talk to PayPal.

50:45.000 --> 50:51.000
And say, no, he isn't trading drugs. He actually is getting this from digital hats.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
But anyway, so I've been playing TF2.

50:54.000 --> 51:01.000
I've also been going back to Newgrounds and playing all the small little itty-bitty things there.

51:02.000 --> 51:08.000
There was one in particular I was really attracted to, and I'm actually going to look it up.

51:08.000 --> 51:15.000
It had like a death state, so you either were alive and could do certain things,

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
or then you died and you could do other things and then get back to life and all that.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
It was a nice little...

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
While you find the name of that, some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
sj100matt says, Segg just said he was fabulous, dropped the mic and walked away.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Yes, he did. He did do that.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
Well, I didn't quite walk away. I'm kind of boxed in here in the seats.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
ActDeaf is suggesting one called TF2NewbiesOnly.com.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
But you're not a noob.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
Oh, yeah. I know how to point and click.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
All right.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Revive is the name of it.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
Which is a really nice little fun game. I do recommend it.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Oh, and Harrison's like, congregate, please.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
And I'm like, and please, I've been on Newgrounds.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
You wouldn't have YouTube if it weren't for Newgrounds. I'll go on the record in saying that.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
Because Newgrounds started when I was in high school, which was forever ago.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
And it's still ticking.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
You better watch it.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
How old are you again? Because I think I'm a little older.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
That's why I'm not saying a number.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
It's all right.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
But anyway, that's been most of my time.

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
Crawling around Newgrounds and TF2.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Oh, and moving.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Tetris in real life.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Yeah, Tetris in real life.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
ActDeaf in our chat room just to clarify a previous comment saying,

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
it's called NewbiesOnly to welcome new players, but there are a lot of vets there.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
So, to be fair to that server.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
Anything else for the gaming week you want to share before we go to me?

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Oh, we'll go to you.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
All right. Honestly, I don't have a lot of new stuff to talk about, so I'll just be real quick.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
Continuing to progress in Diablo 3.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I'm officially way further than I was before.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
I'm in Act 3 now, which before the furthest I got was the beginning of Act 2.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
So, yeah, I guess I'm kind of enjoying it this time.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
I can't even explain it. Don't ask me why.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
I think because I'm taking it at my own pace.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
I'm actually exploring the auction house stuff a little bit.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
Not the money auction house, but the gold one.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
Trying to figure out the ins and outs on how to make money there.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
And that's kind of a fascinating little meta game in and of itself.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
But the real money auction house, forget it.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
I mean, all that stuff is the real high-end stuff.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Otherwise, been playing Warcraft.

53:30.000 --> 53:34.000
Yes, more Mass Effect, but playing a lot of the multiplayer this week.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
I don't know. There was just kind of like a...

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
One night, we even did some streaming this week, didn't we, Darkseid?

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Yeah, that was really...

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
Shane?

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
That was when my character was twitching and spasming on your screen.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Yeah, we were just laughing and having a good time.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
We need to do more game streaming. That was actually fun.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
And of course, more Tomb Raider.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I'm still getting closer to the end on that one.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
And then you're going to lend it to me.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
Sure, I guess, if you'll actually play it. Absolutely.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
I tried playing Mass Effect, but now I bought it on PC.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
That is true.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
That is true.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
So maybe we'll finally get Jamie to talk about another game.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
If for no other reason, I will loan her Tomb Raider for that fact.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
You know what, though? I love To the Moon.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Oh, yeah.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Have you played it?

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Yes, you need to play To the Moon.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
You need to play To the Moon.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
I have not played To the Moon.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
You need to play To the Moon.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
I will. Yes, yes, sir.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Internet, you need to play To the Moon.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
I'm probably where he's about middle-aged now.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
I've just been sort of slowly going through it, but...

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
Have tissues.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
I know. I already sobbed a little bit, because...

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Oh.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
But I found my favorite line.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Oh, you don't know.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
I found my favorite line in the game.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
It was like, that's a problem with you neurotypicals always telling us what to do.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
That was my favorite line in the game so far.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
I did play Civ V because I had to try it.

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
Somebody has built a custom mod that allows you to play as certain Mass Effect civilizations.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
And my fandom...

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I want to be a Krogan.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
I don't know if they have those yet.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
They have Asari and they have Volus.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
It's kind of fun.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
All right.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
So I could talk like this the entire time.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Yes.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
All right.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
There we go.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
That's that for now.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
That's my gaming week.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Let's move on.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
That's the best hat ever.

55:08.000 --> 55:13.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
use the passphrase RING.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Housekeeping tonight.

55:17.000 --> 55:21.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us on Twitter or of course on Facebook.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
We're also on Google Plus.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
We do have a great FOOGLE Question of the Week coming up later in the show,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
so make sure you've answered it if you haven't already.

55:29.000 --> 55:34.000
And I should plug that we are three weeks away from episode 500.

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
Still don't know how we're going to celebrate it, but we'll think of something.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
That's going to be in April, won't it?

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
It will be in April.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
It's going to be right before your birthday.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
It will be.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Ooh, we should definitely have cake.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Yeah.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Jamie's like, throw me a party.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Yay.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
It's my present.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Episode 500.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
And I quit.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
I quit.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
No.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
So see if somebody quits on episode 500.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
That alone is worth tuning in for.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
No, but I should have a diva breakdown.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
It's about time for me to have one.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
Yeah, I'm like, I've had at least two of those, so.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
What's going on in the gaming industry this week,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
now that we're only an hour into the show?

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Loki.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
Oh, I should have talked more.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
Yes.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
There is a brand new Pokémon game coming out in Japan,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
and I'm assuming over here at some point.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
It'll probably be a console release, like a physical release,

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
when it comes out over here.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
But Pokémon Rumble You.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
It's...

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
No, Rumble Me.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
I'm sorry, but the system is the Wii U, not the Wii Me.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Because Wii Me would be really weird.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
That's what I call my cat.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
If you want Pokémon to Rumble You,

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
you have issues of fandom beyond anything that Dark Sakura has for Garris,

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
I'm just saying.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
You can make them Rumble You if you want,

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
because they do sell some individual figures that go along with this game.

56:52.000 --> 56:57.000
That's right, it's going to be using the near-field communication technology

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
of the Wii U to hoard this game like Skylanders.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
The inevitable has happened.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
They have said,

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Hey, guess what?

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
There's a game that involves collectible figures,

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
and they're making money off these figures like crazy.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
Well, I like money.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
We like money.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
Nintendo needs more money, so that's what they're doing.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
They're launching with seven figures.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Of course, one of those figures being Pikachu.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
They're reasonably priced, I guess.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
I guess 1,800 yen, or...

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
1,800 yen is the actual price of the game.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
19 bucks, 20 bucks, whatever.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
And the figures themselves are around 2 bucks, or 200 yen.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
So 2 bucks each.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
However, if you look at those figures, you're like,

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Yeah, that's way too much for a figure.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
They're like the Burger King figures, aren't they?

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
Yeah, they're like shit that you get out of a fucking quarter machine,

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
in the little bubbles, okay?

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
But they're Pokémon!

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
Oh, well in that case, let's charge the Pokémon Premium!

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
It prints money.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
It's evolved into more money!

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
No, but they're gonna be doing this.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
And my guess is this would probably launch over here in the fourth quarter,

58:02.000 --> 58:07.000
just in time for the whole collectible figure game fad

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
to hit its Guitar Hero meltdown phase.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
I am really curious how retail stores are gonna react to this,

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
because there's gonna be a point.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
You know, there's already, like at the Target, or Toys R Us,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
there's already like a Skylanders Isle.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
So now, it's gonna...

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
There's gonna be Disney Infinity, there's gonna be Pokémon,

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
like there's gonna come a point where the retailers are gonna say,

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
Enough! No more.

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
Or it's now a competition to see which one of these we're gonna carry.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
Or, here's a thought, and totally on speculation train.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
You're seeing all these more physical item things,

58:41.000 --> 58:47.000
so that sort of a bait and switch of going more digital for most things,

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
and then just having enough more retail presence things,

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
things that are justifiable beyond bits.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Hmm, interesting.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Just a thought.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Interesting.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
A possible replacement for the Software Isle in the future.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
Yeah.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
Oh my gosh.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Here's my thing.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
Is all the Pokémon that are included in this little pack or whatever,

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
or the figures that they have available, they all look the same.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
I mean, I'm serious.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
I don't know shit about Pokémon, and I'm not about to pretend that I do,

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
but all of these Pokémon in the screenshot look exactly the same,

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
except for color palette swaps or something like that.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
I mean, it's just, they all look the same.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
I just thought of a fun game for a future episode of OLR,

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
is that we'll show Loki pictures of various Pokémon,

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
and say, What do you think this one's called?

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
It's fine, because I don't know.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
As long as it's multiple choice.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
I'm pretty good at guessing.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
No, but seriously, I...

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
I'm not going to say that they're not going to make money from this,

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
because there's people like Shane,

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
that will buy anything that has to do with Pokémon,

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
so I'm not surprised.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
And he will get other people to buy it too.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I'm sure he's super excited to hear that Pokémon Pikachu system

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
is coming out over here.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
He's probably going to pick that up.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
He was trying to convince me I needed one.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
He's your pusher, man.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I'm telling you.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So, yeah.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
They're going to try.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
My thing is, I don't know if it's going to be successful.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And the fact that, you know...
