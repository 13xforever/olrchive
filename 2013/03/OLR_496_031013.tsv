14116	25985	Tonight, March 10th, 2013, one 10-year-old game is discovered hidden inside another, SimCity launches to connection errors in deleted cities, and could more chat functions be coming to the Wii U?
31704	37489	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37569	44334	It's Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 496 for this March 10th, 2013.
44674	51620	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host.
52000	54783	First up, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
54903	56224	How are you doing?
56684	57485	I'm a happy camper.
57505	58766	You're in a very good mood tonight.
58786	60067	I can't possibly imagine why.
60609	62029	No, no reason at all.
81434	83296	I am still very sad.
83757	85719	It had no ice either, so it was all soda.
85779	88822	Whatever that was you got from Jack in the Box smelled very bacon-y.
89162	90183	It's a bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger.
90203	91404	Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger, alright.
92085	93486	Heart attack in a burger.
93667	95288	It's not a heart attack, please.
95308	96830	Come on, you're not going to have a heart attack from that.
97230	101511	Now, if I considered, and I've been thinking about it, but it's just so much food.
101611	108273	If I consider getting the hamburger from Lumberjacks that is the size of a cake.
108774	114535	Yes, it is a large... Is that that restaurant down on Howe with the giant... Lumberjack?
114575	115336	It's horrible.
115516	116196	It is horrible.
116236	116956	I've been there before.
116976	120837	Okay, I remember when Lumberjacks was like a Home Depot type store.
121518	122298	Am I just old?
122998	123558	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
145174	145974	DarkSakura.com
170223	172145	Anyhow, say hello to our chatters.
172225	180955	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
181615	186721	And going to our chat room, a lot of chatters talking about Loki's dinner choice tonight.
187321	191806	Dark Tetsuya saying, like Loki would do the show without eating something with bacon on it.
191994	194917	That's not true, the other, was it last week or the week before?
195137	195938	No, it wasn't last week.
196278	204065	Actually, no, last week I had McNuggets from McDonald's, and the week before they had cheese pizza, so both of us have no bacon on them.
204145	206948	It's very possible that I would do that.
207128	210511	Sometimes you get on a health kick, and I've seen you bring Subway in here.
211412	213793	Um, the only reason, no, I still like Subway.
213833	222715	The only reason I didn't bring Subway is because, um, I tend to get it with onions on it and it just, it stinks for like three days.
222815	224495	Like, the amount of onions that I get.
224875	230977	Basically, the way, like, my wife has ordered Subway for me before and she, here's how she explains it to them.
231437	236798	Put the amount of onions that no human on earth would want on a sandwich and then, like, double that.
237418	239939	You know what, when I order one for Dan, I tell him to make it noxious.
240686	241286	Oh my gosh.
241526	243107	So they put a lot of onion on there.
244147	245587	I like a lot of onion, a lot of garlic.
245887	247408	So stinky stuff, I guess.
247708	249608	Just no vampires near you.
250108	251889	Or like infections or something.
251929	252289	I don't know.
252329	253369	It's just... All right.
253569	255489	Well, it's not a food podcast, believe it or not.
255569	256910	It is a video game podcast.
257390	266692	Before we get into our gaming weeks and the types of things we've been playing tonight, I thought I would give a little plug to Bobby because his show's on before ours at the Voice of Geeks Network.
266712	266732	I
266952	267272	DarkSakura.com
288140	289400	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
311425	314586	So, you know, she's a very, very prominent game actor.
314926	323629	So, Bobby actually had her on the show tonight and was kind enough to name drop Jamie's Tumblr all about Mass Effect.
323989	326329	It's masseffecting.tumblr.com.
326409	327350	Plug, plug, plug, plug.
328910	331713	And you can find the link to my other Tumblr there too, my main Tumblr.
331853	336977	But lots of activity on the Mass Effect blogs everywhere this week because of the last DLC, sad face.
337558	338078	Yeah.
338118	338959	That was on Tuesday.
339920	341321	The wank has been enormous.
342702	342982	Absolutely.
343142	343923	So much wank.
344083	350288	And basically, yes, the Citadel DLC has been like everybody's fanfiction ever.
350409	354432	It really was just a giant glob of fanfic, wasn't it?
354592	356554	Except Tali's singing WTF.
357395	363124	Well, there was a whole... There's a reference where Tali... What was it?
363164	368351	There's a reference to a meme about what does her sweat taste like or something like that?
368371	368892	Yeah.
369273	371816	I mean, there's a scene... Which, A, ew.
373558	400385	I've done actually the rowdy party twice and I've done the calm hanging out party and Tali ends up hung over like piss drunk in the bathroom just saying all kinds of random things every time you click on her if you do the rowdy party it's grunt in the shower talking in his sleep quoting Scarface
402805	403646	It is hilarious.
403666	404226	That's awesome.
406168	408129	Well, I guess we're moving into our gaming weeks.
408249	410790	All I really wanted to do at the top of the show was plug Bobby's interview.
410930	411571	Thank you, Bobby.
411611	413152	Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
413992	417354	But yeah, so obviously Citadel, big deal for you and me being Mass Effect fans.
417795	419656	I plopped my ass in that chair right over there.
420376	422798	I was actually coincidentally working from home that day.
422858	426680	Not because of, I didn't do that because of games, but I had other stuff going on.
427120	444398	so I had to just walk from the office to that chair at 4.30 I plopped there and I didn't leave until 10.30 after I'd beaten everything in that DLC I didn't do it multiple times but I played from start to finish and it was I kind of had a case of the feels oh I did it multiple times I bet you did
445879	446820	I had a case of the feels.
447000	449401	I don't know about you, but I was getting a little choked up.
449461	449821	You know what?
449921	456264	I managed to hold everything together until that one last part when it's very ended over.
456904	458045	And then I lost my shit.
459765	460946	And then I played it again that night.
461486	464447	Which is funny because you and I are in the same boat.
464487	466788	We didn't even get into the series until a year ago.
468109	469530	I've got other friends in the same boat.
469650	469910	I mean...
470550	474691	Becky wasn't even a gamer and she's a Thane shipper.
475971	478772	And so there were feels.
479072	479632	Oh, I bet.
479672	480352	There were feels.
481432	481933	I bet.
482093	483473	They did that very well, by the way.
484533	486153	I didn't even romance Thane.
486734	491215	By the time I watched the third video, I was like, that was so much fan service.
491795	492135	I came.
492155	492955	I came.
496744	498465	Except like typical guides only once, so.
500966	501626	No, no, no.
501946	511370	But I've actually gone through on two playthroughs of the content with who I'm referring to as my head canon, FemShep.
512351	519074	And then I have my primary one who is basically rehashed off of my very, very first female shepherd, my redhead.
519734	521875	If anyone has looked at my blog, it's the redhead.
522816	530664	I have a game file saved right after Horizon, right before you go beat Tim's ass.
531685	534929	And so I got to do everything with that one.
534989	536490	And I did the calmer party.
536971	539654	I have now five save files at the Tango with Garrus.
540942	541563	Just saying.
541783	545306	Which you totally don't get if you are BroShep and you didn't romance.
545466	547468	I mean, it's like a totally different scene.
547668	552632	You know, I went back and watched the dude version of that one and I have to say BroShep is a pretty good wingman.
552913	553093	Yeah.
554034	555395	Poor CluelessTorian.
556696	557356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
586317	588899	Yeah, I've heard that is not a pleasant scene to watch.
588939	592703	That made me feel incredibly uncomfortable.
593784	595125	I'm not going to say gross or dirty or anything.
595145	595946	But the fandom wanted it.
596747	597287	And you know what?
597407	599269	Even the shippers don't really care for it.
599649	599990	I bet.
600703	607606	But it's what, you know, it was, it just seemed, a lot of it, there was some, you know, out of character stuff.
607646	608487	I mean, it was really funny.
608607	609447	It was done the right way.
609527	612749	It was in character, but fourth wall breaking kind of thing.
613129	615310	That just didn't seem in character to me.
615370	616611	What is happening to this show?
616791	618692	I mean, seriously, what is happening to this show?
619572	620873	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
639068	648874	By the way, we've got this thing called E3 and you guys have been at the end of this brand new Mass Effect.
649254	654738	It's not going to have all the characters that they've been so emotionally attached to.
654758	664504	I already said I am dying to go to E3 and be at EA's press conference so I can break down sighing uncontrollably when they unveil a Mass Effect 4 and Bobby will have to hug me.
665925	669128	Well, they've already said their... Whatever.
669188	670329	Whatevs.
671270	671810	W hands.
671970	672491	Whatevs.
674112	675654	Well, I'll tell you what's happening to this show.
675714	679197	Gamer Girl in chat says, Thanks to DarkSakura, I am a Mass Effect whore.
679397	679717	LOL.
679777	680037	Yes!
681339	681879	One of us.
682900	684021	Another one indoctrinated.
684600	686581	Yes, you are in my cult of... Never.
686821	687862	I will never play Mass Effect.
687882	689062	Join the cult of Shepard.
690483	690823	Right, Rob?
691284	691484	Yes.
692744	693385	Okay.
693625	698928	Let me ask a serious question that dives into the anti-Mass Effect-ing a little bit, okay?
699068	699488	Fuckballs.
701029	710114	People didn't like the ending to Mass Effect 3, the large and whole, so I don't see the DLC as a substitute ending, but it is certainly an ending.
710694	713676	Does this make up for the lackluster original ending?
714699	715119	or even Extended Cut.
715139	719602	Well, remember, I went back and had to watch the original ending after I watched Extended Cut.
720102	723385	Which, by the way, I still hate the synthesis ending because it's all fucking space magic.
723485	724545	But, anyway.
724565	725486	So, I...
732219	735501	I actually got into discussions about this with a couple of people.
736042	741165	An apology isn't really a good word for it.
741826	744848	It's more of a, you know what, thank you for sticking with us.
744908	746549	We know we might have screwed up here and there.
746589	748331	We know it wasn't quite what you wanted it to be.
749271	778076	and and I'm actually gonna disagree that I didn't really care for all of the writing in three I mean it seemed like a pretty natural progression from two but I didn't really care for the plot in two it was a great game don't get me wrong it just I didn't care for I didn't care for the whole elusive man bit I thought that was just a pain but um I think it was more of an acknowledgement it was it was a little bit of yeah we've been paying attention here you go
779170	805036	for me it was a send off it was very much the made for TV movie that comes out like two years after the series ended you know it was kind of like the whole let's do let's do one more hurrah let's have the cast of Facts of Life go to Australia for one last hurrah and they get into let's have Blair and Tootie get into a relationship we just need to hang out with Blair and Joe and Tootie it would be shipping Blair and Tootie laughing
808956	810378	Put that on the back of the box.
810558	812540	Mass Effect 3 Citadel DLC.
812600	814142	It was like shipping Blair and Tootie.
814803	819328	Oh, Alan, if I was going to romance Cortez, then I'd have to play a dude.
820149	821150	I'm just not feeling it.
821971	822532	Oh, boy.
822852	825375	But going back into it, I...
826736	854875	I really enjoyed the content I actually enjoyed it more than Omega and really the things I liked about Omega was I liked Nireen's character and I just thought it was cool seeing Arya be a huge bitch and then oh god Rob you're not even okay Leviathan was okay I really more liked just the space waifu parts of that hold on I need some background music for while you're talking about all of this here hold on I'm gonna give you some background music I'm gonna smack a bitch
856892	860637	You take the good, you take the bad You take them both and there you have the bad
861738	864940	I mean, it is kind of the story about Mass Effect.
864980	868863	You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and there you have it.
868903	870524	And you ship everybody.
871064	876027	There was a comment on Tumblr where someone said Mass Effect, where all relationships are canon.
877208	880250	And Charlotte Rae does kind of look like an Asari a little bit.
880670	880871	No.
882151	882332	No.
883112	883412	Anyhow.
883833	888656	But yeah, this is probably the most fun I've had in the game.
889336	892319	I mean... There's a lot of cool extra stuff like the arena is actually a lot of fun.
892640	895102	Getting to have Kasumi in my party again gives me life.
895262	897885	Did you find the secret box in the casino?
898585	899506	I don't think so, no.
899606	901608	Okay, I'm going to tell you how to... Everyone listen up.
901849	903090	Story time with Auntie Jamie.
904233	915076	When you go up the stairs from the bottom floor, and you have the bar that's to your right, that sort of semi-circular bar, go to the end of it, closest to the back wall.
915516	916896	There's a little device down there.
916976	918497	Click on that one, Kasumi pops up.
918717	919897	I couldn't find that thing.
920177	921098	It's upstairs?
921518	923638	It's in the middle level, technically.
923958	926139	The ground level is the flight of stairs leading into the casino.
926259	927539	Right.
927719	929120	No, it didn't show up in the mid-level for me.
929140	930180	I looked everywhere for it.
930895	935158	I ran over the place and I actually found it by complete accident, but I can tell you exactly where it is.
935779	939041	Because Shane and I were having discussions on this because I never got the bonus Kasumi scene.
939651	948154	So, but I'm actually going to go back through with my Renegon, my real bitch of a character, and try to do the whole content as a Renegade, just for fun.
948254	948735	Just for fun.
948855	949355	Just for fun.
949535	949775	All right.
950775	952876	The people that aren't into Mass Effect are falling asleep.
952896	953457	I played other things.
953477	953697	Yep.
953937	954157	All right.
954197	955317	So let's talk about, shut up.
955577	956398	I played something else.
956498	958038	Let's talk about the rest of your gaming week then.
958118	958338	All right.
958358	960199	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week besides Mass Effect?
960379	963721	Oh, I thought we were already talking about my gaming week because that was really my week.
965381	990669	That and Fun Employment, of course But I played a little bit more of To The Moon I put it aside because DLC after DLC kept coming out I really like the game To The Moon It's basically just a story that you click and pick up some things and that's about it I don't really think there's any way to play the game badly But it has such a sweet story that I've really been enjoying it I'm going back and playing it quite a bit
991429	997932	and I started on the last Tomb Raider game, The Guardian of Light, since one of our listeners was kind enough to get it for me.
998593	998933	Oh, nice.
999613	1000613	I didn't get very far.
1000894	1002754	Although Guardian of Light's kind of more of a side story.
1002814	1007657	It's not... Yeah, and I wanted to check it out, you know, so... It's a good game.
1007717	1008037	It's fun.
1009492	1018935	But I mean, really, the other thing that I actually did for Mass Effect type stuff was, not playing the game, I have learned how to mod Xbox files.
1020096	1027779	And then how to copy, we finally got it to work, how to get original PC save files into a temp file so that they will load on the Xbox.
1028679	1030259	You're getting into the hacking a little bit.
1030560	1031300	A little bit of the hacking.
1031320	1032320	Creeping up on Loki's turf.
1032600	1034421	But... Only this is a game he'd never touch.
1035287	1058577	all my stuff I mean basically they are legitimately played games I got to where I did well I cheated a little bit but I mean I was able to recreate and save them and I've been able to reload head morphs on to basically you know how I have like my shepherds typically have NPC hair and different skin textures things that are in the game that all I've done is unlock them with the gibbed editor and
1059037	1067623	Well, I've managed to get head morphs saved from Xbox, get them to work on PC, and get my PC head morphs working on the Xbox so that the hacked data will show up.
1068303	1071465	Basically, Becky got my Shepard to work, my redhead.
1071725	1071925	Nice.
1072326	1075328	I will link a picture in the chat room so you can see exactly how modded she is.
1076228	1076528	Alrighty.
1076568	1077629	So that's what I've been doing.
1078169	1078450	Alright.
1078990	1082192	Alright, Loki, I know you're dying to talk about a different game, so how was your gaming week?
1083013	1083853	My game week is alright.
1083913	1085194	I didn't play a whole ton of things.
1086374	1086855	Maybe I did.
1086975	1088395	Let's see.
1088435	1089656	Stuff I've been playing.
1089936	1096638	Far Cry 2, I've been still trying to recreate the part of the map that we used to play the multiplayer map from Grand Theft Auto 4.
1097019	1100840	Although I'm not sure if I'm actually going to be able to do it now because I'm running out of objects.
1101240	1107863	I've used about a quarter of them already and I still have to duplicate the whole building over to another spot and then
1108523	1109304	Build another one.
1109544	1111625	I think I'm going to run out of objects before I get the map done.
1113406	1116148	Might be a whole lot of wasted time for nothing.
1116308	1118550	I was pimping it last week.
1118630	1120031	The Free Bundle.
1120531	1123233	You can go online to freebundle.com and download free games.
1123433	1126315	They put out a new set of games each week or so.
1126936	1127936	They actually had a new set.
1128697	1130398	One of the games in it was called Zenith.
1131378	1135001	Zenith is kind of a weird game, but it's fun.
1135321	1137903	It reminds me a lot of Jet Grind Radio.
1138563	1146550	And it's basically this, looks like this character is wearing a cowboy hat and some sort of mech suit thing, but you skate along the ground, you can grind on the walls and all sorts of stuff.
1146590	1154816	And it has like the story that goes along with it, but it's just a fun game and very trippy, very stylized look to it.
1155997	1160041	But it's a lot of fun, and it also uses the Xbox 360 controller on the PC, so...
1161102	1165328	Definitely go check that out if you can, because it's free, so that's the best price.
1167471	1174762	Speaking of stuff that's on PC, I happened to... There was one of those... It wasn't the Humble Bundle, but it was...
1176244	1179488	One of those other ones, I actually pimped it out on Twitter earlier this week.
1180008	1183593	They had Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon as one of the games you can unlock.
1183653	1184974	So I got that for five bucks.
1185495	1185875	Nice.
1186636	1192864	And even though I've already beaten it on the console, I figured I'd try it on PC again.
1192884	1193404	Nice.
1194457	1194837	It's fun.
1195637	1199099	I actually modded the game to unlock the frame rate from 30 to 60.
1200359	1205261	They have some field of view mods you can do to it, so that's kind of fun.
1206121	1213364	Other than that, we're starting to start a co-op game on the Xbox for Borderlands.
1213604	1220429	Yeah, wanted to do Borderlands 2 but that DLC just fucked up all of our games so I can't really start that again.
1220910	1228696	But we're going to start Saints Row the 3rd again and do co-op through that so hopefully I can get the rest of my achievements by finishing some of the missions in different ways and stuff.
1229816	1236862	And Call of Duty, I made a record on one of my deathmatch games, 62 kills in 10 minutes.
1237881	1238442	That's impressive.
1238662	1239584	That's a lot of murder.
1239624	1240765	It was ridiculous.
1241006	1243509	It was like my fun house of carnage.
1243529	1246073	I had so many perks up at one time.
1246093	1250139	It was not fun for them.
1250620	1251882	That's pretty much it.
1252082	1253404	That's all I kind of played this week.
1253820	1261042	Well, Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Jamie talks about Mass Effect, Loki talks about Grand Theft Auto, what will Rob talk about?
1261182	1261522	Wow.
1262242	1263342	Funny you should mention that.
1263443	1265583	There was a new patch in World of Warcraft this week, 5.2.
1266023	1266523	Oops.
1269644	1276506	Look, most of the talk is on my other show, Plug Plug, Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, Plug Plug, live Wednesday nights at VOG Network, Plug Plug.
1277006	1279528	But I'll just quickly say, yes, I explored the new patch.
1280469	1290476	A big part of the patch is that there's a new island, lots more dailies to do, which I know a lot of the fandom has collectively eye-rolled at how much this expansion is relying on dailies.
1290776	1294178	But these really aren't so bad, except for the fact that it's super crowded.
1294538	1296820	So the best way to do dailies, group up with friends.
1297160	1305306	So most every weeknight, like later at night, 10, 11, myself, Alan, Shane, and Evan, who's in our Horde House guild for the other show,
1306026	1333509	uh we've been grouping up to do dailies every night and it's it's so much easier that way and just kind of looking at the new content lots of little fan servicey things much easier to get elder charms and spirits of harmony and there's this treasure room now so like you can get a key and you go on this quest to go in a solo scenario so it's actually a legit solo instance and it's a treasure room and it's just there's all these traps everywhere but you have five minutes to grab as much treasure as you can
1333649	1335791	Oh my god, it's that part from that video game show that I liked.
1336231	1337412	Where you had the Velcro vest?
1337472	1340234	Yes, they like turned that into a scenario in WoW.
1340414	1341635	Okay, I have to play again.
1341775	1343436	Is leveling any faster?
1344276	1346558	Um, no, they didn't reduce the XP or anything.
1346938	1349360	I think there might be new heirlooms, I could be wrong though.
1349952	1377122	so that's so stolen also from Borderlands the secret armory of General Nox same situation well you know what Warcraft is really great at taking a lot of pop culture stuff and kind of implementing it in their game I mean you know it's part of what's made the game last as long as it has so that's all I'll say about World of Warcraft but yes I've been enjoying the new patch probably won't get to enjoy the new raid though I hear it's pretty tough so we'll see when the LFR version opens up next week
1379083	1380004	Other games I've been playing.
1380164	1382645	Talked about Mass Effect Citadel already.
1383346	1389630	Not going to go back to that territory, but I will say, you know, plot myself down on the couch, played it start to finish.
1390170	1395594	I can't remember the last time a video game kind of just, like, commanded my attention like that.
1395674	1398456	So, you know, I know Mass Effect has its haters.
1399536	1400396	And they can leave!
1400556	1401097	No, I'm kidding.
1401557	1415320	No, you can stay, but just realize that, you know, Shane and I were talking about it, you know, after we'd both beaten it, and he said, you know, yes, I can replay the DLC over and over again because it's a lot like Battlestar Galactica, which I can watch over and over again.
1415360	1417381	You know, and I think that's a decent comparison.
1417441	1422362	It's like, the Mass Effect plot is a really good sci-fi show, like Battlestar Galactica.
1422862	1424642	But even that show has its haters, too, so whatever.
1424662	1425743	The wank, Rob, the wank.
1425823	1426083	The wank.
1427363	1427843	Other stuff.
1427963	1428684	Brand new game.
1428964	1430284	This is a busy week for games.
1430444	1435565	I didn't even touch SimCity, which is the game everybody's talking about this week, and I don't think any of us did.
1436186	1437606	Because I'm smart.
1437826	1439206	I didn't care.
1439887	1443748	I haven't really played a SimCity game since... I didn't even like SimCity 2000, to be honest.
1444728	1448771	I love the Super Nintendo one, and the original one on PC was awesome.
1449011	1454254	And we always joke about the CD-ROM remake, but, you know, I never really got into the future SimCity games.
1454974	1457016	Three, four, I didn't really care for them.
1457076	1470504	So when they said there was a new one and it was going to rely on your friend's input, all this hubba-ba-ba about DRM aside, which I know is a story coming up later on we'll get into, but all that crap aside, it's like, I just wasn't interested in the game.
1472583	1473443	is that so wrong?
1473784	1476585	that it's just a game I didn't seem interested in?
1477365	1479246	when these things cost 60 bucks a pop?
1479366	1483588	it's okay, I didn't care either alright, so you know what I did spend my 60 dollars on?
1484089	1492373	Tomb Raider which in some ways was a leap of faith because, real talk Tomb Raider series, last few games little stale, right?
1492553	1494054	last few games, all have been reboots
1495134	1501963	So now they really have rebooted Tomb Raider, and honestly, it's the kick in the ass the series needed.
1502143	1506189	It's intense.
1507531	1511416	I know I've brought up this movie on OLR before, but it's the best comparison I can honestly think of.
1511676	1512156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1537404	1546749	It's just, it is a tense movie, and the entire side, it's like, you are just sitting on the edge of your seat going, and like, at the end of the movie, you just have to unclench.
1546989	1548730	Like, seriously, it's like that tense.
1549030	1558355	Okay, Tomb Raider is a lot like that, because like, right from the get-go, I mean, you've all seen the little cutscene that the game starts with, the same thing they showed at E3, but then it's like,
1558915	1573592	it don't stop it's like it's a cave-in and now there's people down this island that are chasing you and now like you you start to just feel bad for Laura Croft because bad things won't stop happening to her and do
1573592	1578055	Do you remember the early, early leaks about Tomb Raider said it was a survival horror?
1578075	1584779	Do you remember they leaked several years ago that this was happening, that Tomb Raider was getting rebooted and it was going to be a survival horror game?
1585640	1586260	I don't remember that.
1586280	1594806	A lot of people kind of lost the survival horror thing, but there's a lot in common with like a lot of like jump scares, oh shit moments, like...
1595186	1619528	I'm walking along the path, da-da-da, I've got to get to this, I've got to get to this radio tower so I can be in the transmission, I've got to go, I've got to go, I'm running, I'm running, and fuck, I'm in a spring trap, and, like, now I'm hanging upside down, having to kill guards, like, it's just, like, it's, like, non-stop, like, stuff like that, so, um, and on top of that, the game is kind of like a, one of my friends said it was, like, Metroidvania type of, and I was like, really?
1619588	1621550	But the more I played it, I'm like, it
1621770	1622210	and so on.
1648005	1650367	Link's Grappling Hook
1670825	1679530	I would say maybe the only reservation some people may have is that I'm a third of the way through the game and I've only been playing for about four hours, maybe four and a half.
1679990	1685833	So the single player campaign appears to be 12 hours, maybe 15 hours tops if you're very meticulous about everything.
1687214	1689896	So just kind of for a $60 game, take that with a grain of salt.
1690016	1690296	But
1692017	1697120	You know, it's a very doesn't let up 15 hours.
1698300	1703823	The tomb raiding is optional, which I know has said a lot of people's kind of been giving them a question mark.
1703843	1706745	Like, okay, what the hell is a Tomb Raider game where you're not actually raiding tombs?
1707305	1733931	well here's the deal there's these hidden tombs that you'll find and you can go inside and it's basically a giant puzzle and if you solve the puzzle you get a treasure chest at the end that will not only give you like maybe an upgrade for your bow or you know something like that but it will also reveal random things on your main map that you may have missed like you missed this relic here you missed this document here and da da da da so yes the tomb raiding is optional but if you're going to go for 100 completion rate
1735231	1737493	That stuff's going to go a very long way in doing so.
1739435	1740916	And again, I haven't even touched multiplayer.
1741356	1746700	Haven't heard good things about it, but I want to refrain from making further comment until I've actually had a chance to try it myself.
1748021	1749282	I really don't want to play with strangers.
1749442	1751504	I want to try to get some VOG people.
1751844	1752865	Anybody got Tomb Raider for 360?
1753225	1756428	Because we need to have a night on Tomb Raider pretty soon.
1758089	1759190	What else did I want to say about Tomb Raider?
1759350	1760912	There was another negative thing I had to say.
1761212	1762653	Oh, here's the negative.
1764628	1768971	I want to find whoever invented the shaky cam technique and punch them in the face.
1770012	1773314	There's a lot of shaky cam, especially in the beginning of the game.
1774375	1779859	It's lessened itself a little bit now that we're a little ways in the game, but the very beginning of the game had a lot of shaky cam.
1780680	1788065	I don't usually get sick playing video games, but I had to close my eyes and look down and listen and be like, fucking stop with the shaky cam.
1788556	1789076	DarkSakura.com
1810166	1833068	but you know I can always look away it didn't detract from the game as a whole but I did want to kind of just point that out like stop stop shaky cam stop it Dungeon Buster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says thanks a lot Blair Witch that's from Dungeon Buster Degenerate Johnny says shaky cam equals JJ Abrams yeah thanks a lot JJ Abrams
1834069	1836392	TigerClaw says, Rob, any lens flares?
1836913	1837894	No, not that I've seen.
1838715	1841698	You do get a torch.
1842940	1843821	Maybe it wasn't Michael Bay.
1843861	1845483	It was the guy that did Gladiator.
1845503	1847726	Remember Gladiator was very shaky cam too.
1847826	1849328	That kind of got popular after that.
1851097	1855859	Ragenator in chat says, there's one thing missing from Tomb Raider games, a full-on lesbian scene.
1856499	1857920	Oh, you silly boys.
1859560	1862922	Tigerclaw says, I hear you can play the entire game using just the bow.
1864362	1865683	Hypothetically, I guess you could.
1866543	1868764	It's more fun to use the machine gun, but okay.
1869164	1870225	Play however you want.
1872666	1896488	Dungeon Buster also says it's a torrent of bad news that never ends for Croft in the reboot it's great yeah you know all these things you were hearing about in the preamp about how you will see how Laura Croft had to toughen up and all this it's like yeah yeah I can see it I can definitely see it all right anyhow that's enough that's all I want to say about Tomb Raider for now I'll let you know more when I actually beat the game let's get to housekeeping tonight
1897809	1912936	follow us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR and you can also follow us on Facebook facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and we're on Google Plus I don't think we have anything else really big coming up show wise I should go ahead I was going to do this at the end of the show but I'll plug it now
1913516	1914357	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1929634	1930655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1953092	1954333	for Seg's project.
1954413	1960875	So we're going to talk to Seg about starting a gaming studio and what his whole vision is and all that.
1960995	1963336	And I'll talk to him next week about that.
1963356	1964037	Looking forward to having him.
1964257	1967958	You should have heard me yell at my computer.
1968839	1969059	Why?
1969539	1974621	Because I would get like one thing perfect and it was missing something.
1974701	1977923	So I would go back and try to retweak it and lose everything I did.
1978003	1978983	And it was awful.
1979423	1980704	And I would scream obscenities.
1982406	1983907	Well, but you worked your way through it.
1983987	1988312	So we'll interview Seg about any obscenities he may or may not have yelled.
1989073	1990794	I didn't yell any at him because he's nice.
1991295	1991796	I know, I know.
1991816	1992356	He is very nice.
1993457	1995319	Okay, anyhow, let's get into gaming news then.
1995419	1998703	We will start off with Loki with what's going on in gaming news this week.
2000086	2004308	So there's a lot of stuff coming out about Steam Box.
2004809	2007790	They were showing some of those piston computers and stuff.
2008190	2009451	Man, $1,000 for that thing.
2010311	2011612	Nope, not going to buy it.
2012252	2026839	But yeah, the Xi3 is one of the first Steam Box computers or third-party Steam Boxes, not necessarily something made by Steam or Valve, but it's to spec, I guess.
2027299	2036229	I don't know, but $1,000, man, for something that's just a really small form factor, I would just spend probably less than that and make something even better spec-wise.
2037290	2038972	And who cares if it takes up a little extra space?
2038992	2042536	You know, full tower, you can put it inside of a TV stand, you'll never notice it.
2043197	2049383	But one of the things that they're saying they could do is that the Steam Box could actually expand the PC landscape.
2049683	2054568	And this is according to the hardware manufacturer MSI.
2054948	2059493	They do a lot of third-party graphics cards and motherboards.
2060093	2061014	Thank you for watching!
2076342	2077122	I kind of agree with that.
2077142	2077563	I've kind of...
2096605	2096906	and many more.
2119086	2129316	That's the only thing that kind of holds a lot of people back, I guess, from buying a PC to game on is because, oh, hey, cool, I've got this awesome PC I spent a lot of money on.
2129456	2133800	Oh, crap, now I've got to buy another $300 graphics card.
2133920	2135261	Oh, now I've got to buy some more RAM.
2135341	2136682	Oh, I need to upgrade my processor.
2136702	2139244	Well, the upgrade my processor, I've got to upgrade my motherboard.
2139505	2141126	And now I've got to buy another graphics card.
2141146	2144229	Wouldn't that also just randomly go with a regular PC anyway?
2146198	2146899	That's what I'm saying.
2147059	2148360	I'm talking PC in general.
2148380	2149941	I'm not necessarily saying Steam boxes.
2150381	2153123	I'm just saying that, you know, that's what holds people back a lot of times.
2153183	2166153	And I think originally with the Steam box, it was kind of this, okay, listen, we're going to put out this thing that's going to cost an X amount of money and it's going to be able to run everything on, you know, Steam or, you know, whatever these games are going to be.
2167073	2173096	Also, they're saying that Valve is actually going to be sharing some of the Steam Box prototypes within the next few months.
2175017	2183742	Whether they're going to be giving them to customers or developers or whatever, but I guess they're going to be out there in the next few months, so we'll hopefully get to see some of those prototypes.
2184522	2191627	and, hey, if you happen to be interested in the piston, you can get $100 off of it right now.
2191647	2192127	That's right, $100.
2192167	2195289	And then it'll run you, what, $999?
2199668	2199969	I don't know.
2200269	2208782	And also, you can get an extra 128 gig solid state drive for... Or I guess you upgrade the 128 gig solid state drive to 512 gigs for $750.
2209343	2210144	That's really, really nice.
2216212	2226343	Yeah, seriously, if you're going to make a PC that's going to run on your TV, just build a PC because all graphics cards nowadays, they output the HDMI, just shove it next to your TV, done.
2226603	2229987	No need to pay extra money for this really small PC.
2230227	2234572	We've had a computer hooked up to our TV for the past seven years.
2236093	2236293	Oops.
2238638	2243881	Alright, well, we are going to switch gears here a little bit before we get into the next story.
2244462	2252647	You know, Orange Lawns Radio, it is the show where every gamer has a voice, and many of these voices are going to be coming together at PAX East next week.
2253347	2254868	Is it next weekend?
2256309	2257109	No, it's in two weeks.
2257590	2258110	I don't even know.
2258150	2258590	Soon.
2259070	2259571	Soon.
2259751	2262392	The very gaming term of soon.
2262712	2263933	We're on the wrong coast.
2263993	2264993	I wish I was going.
2265393	2267974	But we have one of the folks that's going to be at PAX East.
2268455	2269535	I want to bring on to the show.
2269655	2270616	It's somebody kind of special.
2270936	2278099	Somebody well known, not just for her cosplay, but for a very cool achievement of sorts when it comes to the Omegathon with PAX.
2278499	2281321	So I want to give our buddy, and this is one of Ranma's buddies.
2281381	2283563	I'm very excited he let us have her on the show.
2284664	2286825	Our buddy from Anime Jam Session, plug, plug, Tuesday nights.
2287586	2289988	This is Pork Buns, but we can call her Tina.
2290508	2296613	And we're going to get her on the line right now and talk a little bit about PAX East and what's going on.
2296913	2297834	She sounds delicious.
2298034	2298855	Hey, Tina, you there?
2299520	2302221	Yes, I am, and I heard that bit about me being delicious.
2302341	2305523	Well, pork buns are delicious, magically delicious.
2305543	2306063	Yes, they are.
2306303	2307544	Well, welcome to the show, Tina.
2307564	2308204	How are you doing?
2308865	2309845	I'm doing all right.
2310025	2315168	I am slightly exhausted from sculpting for eight hours, but I think I'll be fine.
2315188	2316468	What exactly are you sculpting?
2317269	2327054	I am sculpting the mask for Corvo from Dishonored, and I'm doing a clay sculpt of it before I do a mold of it and then cast it.
2327954	2340091	Now, my understanding is that, and you'll have to excuse me, I'm on the wrong coast, so I don't get to a lot of cons on the East Coast, but my understanding is you do some real bang-up awesome cosplay at a lot of the East Coast cons.
2341052	2344637	Is there some characters that you've done that folks may recognize you as, our East Coast listeners?
2345559	2352001	Um, um, I think most people know me as the Amon from Legend of Korra.
2352122	2354642	I know that's been, um, passed around a lot.
2355723	2361665	And I've also done the Journey cosplay from the PSN, the PSN indie hit.
2361905	2362305	Oh, of course.
2362365	2362986	So I've done that.
2363046	2366127	And I've also designed a tutorial so people might know me from that too.
2366147	2368148	Uh, basically no one sees my face.
2368588	2368808	Yeah.
2370973	2372755	But I see your face on Skype right now.
2372795	2373556	It's a pretty face.
2373596	2374497	You should show it.
2374517	2374858	Thank you.
2375579	2378623	Now, Journey on PlayStation Network, am I right?
2379163	2382047	You actually got complimented on this by some important people, right?
2382625	2385187	Yes, we got a feature done.
2385227	2390592	Me and my friends, Chris, Morgan, Kate, and Nicole, we got featured on Kotaku.
2391693	2395956	And we've also gotten some attention from the company that made it, which is That Game Company.
2396157	2401741	And of course, the Grammy-nominated composer, Austin Wintory.
2402242	2404144	So we got some buzz for that, which was really nice.
2404844	2408027	Oh yeah, absolutely, and it's even better when no one can see my face.
2428224	2434010	All my popular cosplays, so-called popular cosplays, no one ever sees my face.
2434590	2435511	Is that a trademark thing?
2435551	2437633	You sound very proud of that, that nobody sees your face.
2437653	2444020	I do, I do, because I feel like I take away that control for someone to judge how good I look.
2444280	2447063	And I'm just like, well, you can't judge because there's something covering my face.
2447443	2449746	So I'm forced you to look at my craftsmanship.
2450296	2453999	Actually, I have a friend who has a and had an excellent costume.
2454479	2462205	But it was go as a larva at AX for a few years in a row and had an excellent costume.
2462685	2464687	But it was from a Vampire Princess Miu.
2464707	2465607	I don't know if you've seen it, Rob.
2465968	2466148	No.
2466228	2466388	Yeah.
2466568	2475835	But but yeah, she used to do a larva costume just for the sake of showing off the good costume and not having to, you know, with the mask and everything.
2476533	2477253	Yeah, exactly.
2477313	2488078	Because I feel like when you have your face out there, people tend to look at whether you look similar to the character, whether you're good looking, whether you're bad looking, if there's any kind of flaws in your face.
2488399	2491260	And I just take that control from people when I have a masked costume.
2491300	2493021	So that's why it's my favorite thing to do.
2493921	2496943	That's a very powerful way of looking at it.
2496983	2501044	I'm kind of like... Throw it the opposite way with my bike and costume a few years ago.
2501084	2502865	I showed off my racks so no one would look at my face.
2503526	2504166	Yeah.
2504851	2505212	DarkSakura.com
2523969	2537266	Hot Chicks, and, you know, Dressed as Mai, and Chun-Li Not that there's anything wrong with that, you know, those are great characters and so forth But, you know, when you focus on that, like, that's not cool, right?
2539929	2558788	well to each their own and you know for people who can show off their body and they're comfortable with that that's fantastic really really fantastic for them I'm just not that kind of person and I like to be as kind of float by and have people just recognize me for my craftsmanship because that's what I really care about so
2559804	2563105	I don't like to show off my body either, and the internet is very thankful for that.
2563185	2564905	So are the rest of us, Rob.
2566985	2568526	I've actually checked out some of your costumes.
2568546	2570166	I think that your work is impeccable.
2570626	2572246	Actually, I wanted to ask you about something.
2572346	2575147	Have you seen that material that they put out that's in the jar?
2575407	2576207	What's that stuff called?
2576827	2582508	It's like $10, and it's supposed to be not like Sculpey, but you pour it in the mold and you'll bake it.
2583328	2584968	And it's supposed to be really inexpensive.
2585108	2587749	I was actually wondering if you had an opinion about that or if you've ever used it.
2588149	2589270	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2611088	2638775	for example like Wonderflex or the new popular material right now, Worbla and put paper clay on top of it which is basically very very fine paper mache but for this mask that I'm making what I'm doing is I'm actually taking a modeling clay so it never dries and I'm probably going to do a brush on rubber silicone mode and I'm going to cast it out of I believe it's a resin, I'm not exactly sure it's called smooth cast and
2639395	2641876	It's a really lightweight, very, very durable material.
2641936	2643437	It's really, really hard to sand, though.
2644117	2645098	So I'm not looking forward to that.
2645778	2651100	I haven't done cons in quite a while, but I've told you this before, Rob.
2651120	2653721	I'm actually planning on doing a Shepard cosplay myself.
2653922	2655122	Oh, my.
2655942	2658944	But I have a friend who is a ceramic sculptor.
2659824	2660024	Oh, wow.
2660064	2663186	And I was actually going to have her make my helmet and part of the ceramic.
2664201	2665481	That's actually pretty good, yeah.
2665681	2667142	Are you a Mass Effect fan, Tina?
2667442	2668882	I am a huge Mass Effect fan.
2668902	2669422	Oh, you're good.
2669442	2670242	Take that, Loki.
2670543	2671363	Are you on Tumblr?
2671463	2672003	Another one.
2672903	2673863	I am on Tumblr, yes.
2674443	2675364	We'll have to talk later.
2675404	2678184	Your Mass Effect fans do nothing for me.
2678304	2678805	I don't care.
2678985	2679665	You know what, Tina?
2679705	2686826	That's the reason we were running late tonight is the guy before us here at VOG Network tonight had an interview with Jennifer Hale and we couldn't shut up about it.
2687207	2688367	That's why we were running late.
2688427	2690427	I had some serious... Jennifer Hale loves Fangirl Link.
2690447	2691168	That's understandable.
2693789	2694029	All right.
2694389	2706661	Well, Tina, something else I want to talk to you about, which I'm sure we definitely have our listeners that are into cosplay and so forth, but there might be some that don't follow that as much, but they're certainly following what's going on at the various conventions.
2706681	2715049	And we're going to have quite a few people and listeners that are going to be at PAX East who are going to get to see you participate in this year's Omegathon, right?
2715069	2715149	Yeah.
2715660	2721484	Tina is the runner-up of last year's Omegathon, and if I am not mistaken, I have heard that you are the first female to make the finals.
2739662	2740823	Actually, that is untrue.
2740843	2745746	I am only the second female to make Omegathon.
2745806	2750710	The record was broken by Cassandra Leis two years ago.
2751170	2752531	So she made it to the finals too.
2753112	2754793	And I was only the second one to make it.
2754973	2758495	And then there was another female that made it to the finals for this Prime.
2758596	2760337	And I believe she was the first one for Prime.
2761252	2764274	Somebody lied to me, but you know what?
2764374	2767577	It still does not lessen the girl power any.
2767597	2771379	That's three PAXs in a row, so congratulations, right?
2772000	2773441	Yeah, absolutely.
2773941	2778684	So what was the game that unfortunately knocked you out of contention last year?
2778785	2779265	What was it?
2780015	2788337	This game called Crokinole, it's a Canadian game, and the best way I can describe it is like hand curling.
2788897	2791118	It's like curling, but you're using your fingers instead.
2792018	2806041	And what happened was, we were head to head for a while, and unfortunately, my partner, Michael Tolan, he had done one shot that gave them 30 points off the bat, and they won it, and we were like, oh, well, that's what happens.
2807082	2808542	You don't play a game, like, ever.
2809182	2813167	What was your reaction when the game was unveiled?
2813207	2816691	Because it's always a mystery what the big last game is going to be at the Omegathon.
2817211	2820495	And it's always unveiled right at the last minute while you're there on stage.
2820855	2824019	What was your reaction when they showed, oh, it's this obscure Canadian.
2824099	2825641	It's not even a freaking video game.
2826400	2827020	No, it isn't.
2827040	2834724	Well, before, what they did was they teased us beforehand by playing the Canadian National Anthem, which they had Jonathan Coulton sing.
2836185	2836705	I love him.
2837786	2838666	I know, I love him too.
2839166	2842728	And we were watching it, and we were just like, oh crap, what the hell is it?
2842948	2846630	And when they revealed it, I think we all looked at each other and was like, what the F?
2849591	2854854	Like, we were all dressed up really mobile, just in case it was a mobile game or something, and we were all like...
2855936	2856977	Thanks for watching!
2875703	2879824	Is that tough to do in that arena where there's just all those people?
2879924	2883325	Or are you able to just block it out and be like, I gotta focus on the game?
2883365	2887606	Or is that really just a huge distraction when it's all those people?
2888987	2896949	Well, I'm used to being on stage in much more embarrassing situations because I've been in cosplay skits and cosplay events and stuff.
2897269	2898649	And yeah, it wasn't as hard.
2899930	2904171	So it's like all your years of cosplaying helped you prepare for that moment.
2904191	2904271	Yeah.
2904551	2906351	I was hamming it up, though.
2906431	2915854	I was giving Hunger Games signs, like the three-finger salute to people in the front, and people were cheering for me, starting chants and stuff.
2915894	2916514	It was really fun.
2917034	2919034	And may the odds be ever in your favor.
2919695	2920275	Pretty much.
2920995	2926436	So do you know what games are going to be involved with this Omegathon at PAX East in a couple weeks?
2927016	2927256	Yes.
2927857	2929777	They revealed it to us last week.
2930356	2931898	Bomberman, NBA Jam, Jenga
2944766	2945286	Oh, no.
2945346	2947647	Yeah, they usually throw a board game or something in there.
2947687	2949507	I've seen Jenga before.
2949767	2951407	So what are you doing to prepare?
2951447	2956388	Are you preparing at all, or are you just like, I'm going to wing it?
2956488	2960169	I'm actually just practicing with my friends.
2960229	2969911	I have a friend named Norm who is a tournament winner of Bomberman, so he's been coaching me, and all we're really missing is I, the tiger, playing in the background.
2969931	2970371	Ha ha ha!
2971992	2972732	I'm terrible.
2973053	2974253	I am terrible right now.
2974393	2977295	I have just made a pass not killing myself.
2978576	2981678	And Jenga, I don't think I can prepare for at all.
2981898	2988983	And NBA Jam, I'm going to move on to as soon as I feel like I don't suck abysmally at bottom, man.
2990484	2993325	Can I give you a hint on Jenga that doesn't involve ibuprofen?
2993866	2994126	Sure.
2994646	2995527	Practice with your left hand.
2996347	2997388	Practice with my left hand.
2997468	2999109	That's a very good tip.
2999169	3000070	I'll have to practice that.
