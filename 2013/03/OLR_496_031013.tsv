7000	14000	Loserhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, March 10th, 2013, one 10-year-old game is discovered hidden inside another, SimCity launches to connection errors in deleted cities, and could more chat functions be coming to the Wii U?
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 496 for this, March 10th, 2013.
44000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host.
51000	56000	First up, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. How are you doing?
56000	57000	I'm a happy camper.
57000	60000	You're in a very good mood tonight, I can't possibly imagine why.
60000	62000	No, no reason at all.
62000	64000	Let me talk about, let me come back to that in a minute.
64000	66000	Also, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
66000	67000	Hi.
67000	70000	Who's not in a good mood tonight, has no reason to be.
70000	72000	I'm fine, I've fed myself.
72000	74000	Alright, then you're in a great mood.
74000	83000	I am out of soda, and even though I had this like, what is this, I don't know, large container, I am still very sad.
83000	85000	And it had no ice either, so it was all soda.
85000	88000	Whatever that was you got from Jack in the Box smelled very bacon-y.
88000	90000	It's a Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger.
90000	91000	Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger, alright.
91000	93000	Heart attack in a burger.
93000	96000	It's not a heart attack, please, come on, you're not gonna have a heart attack from that.
96000	108000	Now, if I considered, and I've been thinking about it, but it's just so much food, if I considered getting the hamburger from Lumberjacks, that is the size of like, a cake.
108000	109000	Pizza?
110000	115000	Is that that restaurant down on Howe with the giant, like, Lumberjack in front of Jack?
115000	117000	It's horrible, it is horrible, I've been there before.
117000	122000	Okay, I remember when Lumberjacks was like a Home Depot type store, is that just, am I just old?
122000	123000	Alright, forget it.
123000	130000	I don't know, but they have delicious breakfast, and they have this thing that apparently is so large that they take pictures of people that buy it, so.
130000	131000	By delicious you mean horrible.
131000	132000	It's large.
132000	134000	It's a man versus food type of challenge.
134000	135000	Yes, exactly.
135000	144000	It makes me think of the pho place that does the pho king challenge where you eat the, what is it, two pounds of meat and noodles in the broth or whatever?
144000	145000	I could do that.
145000	146000	Oh my gosh.
146000	147000	Only two pounds? That's not that bad.
147000	149000	No, I think it's two pounds of meat, two pounds of noodles.
149000	151000	It's a huge bowl.
151000	155000	I'd like have to not eat for a week and then go in and let my stomach explode.
156000	166000	Ever since my gallbladder got taken out and all those other medical issues I had a few years ago, I don't think I'm suited for those man versus food challenges.
166000	169000	I will leave that stuff to Loki and maybe DarkSira.
169000	172000	Anyhow, say hello to our chatters.
172000	181000	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
181000	187000	And I'm going to our chat room, a lot of chatters talking about Loki's dinner choice tonight.
187000	192000	Dark Tetsuya saying, like Loki would do the show without eating something with bacon on it.
192000	196000	That's not true. The other, was it last week or the week before? No, it wasn't last week.
196000	202000	Actually, no, last week I had McNuggets from McDonald's and the week before they had cheese pizza.
202000	204000	So both of those have no bacon on them.
204000	206000	It's very possible that I would do that.
206000	208000	It doesn't, you don't have.
208000	211000	Sometimes you get on a health kick and I've seen you bring Subway in here.
211000	214000	The only reason, no, I still like Subway.
214000	219000	The only reason I didn't bring Subway is because I tend to get it with onions on it.
219000	223000	And that just, it stinks for like three days.
223000	225000	Like the amount of onions that I get.
225000	231000	Basically the way, like my wife has ordered Subway for me before and she, here's how she explains it to them.
231000	237000	Put the amount of onions that no human on earth would want on a sandwich and then like double that.
237000	240000	You know what, when I order one for Dan, I tell them to make it noxious.
240000	241000	Oh my gosh.
241000	243000	So they put a lot of onion on there.
243000	245000	I like a lot of onion, a lot of garlic.
245000	247000	So stinky stuff, I guess.
247000	249000	There's just no vampires near you.
249000	252000	Or like infections or something. I don't know. It's just.
252000	255000	All right. Well, it's not a food podcast, believe it or not.
255000	257000	It is a video game podcast.
257000	260000	Before we get into our gaming weeks and the types of things we've been playing tonight,
260000	266000	I thought I would give a little plug to Bobby because, you know, his show's on before ours at the Voice of Geeks Network.
266000	268000	I think there's like two weeks in a row I've plugged his show.
268000	272000	Well, I mean, we plug it every week, but this week was especially special.
272000	274000	And that's why Dark Soccer was squeaking earlier.
274000	276000	It was super special.
276000	280000	Because Bobby, I don't know how this man is able to get away with this stuff.
280000	281000	Well, I do.
281000	284000	And it wasn't like very special as in after school special type thing.
284000	285000	No, no, it was actually special.
285000	286000	Nor was it short bus.
286000	288000	No, it was actually very special.
288000	289000	It was special in a true form.
290000	296000	He had an interview tonight with Jennifer Hale, a.k.a. Fem Shep, although she's certainly done.
296000	297000	I mean, she has a huge resume.
297000	298000	She's done a lot of other stuff.
298000	301000	What was Marvel Marvel in the current Avengers thing?
301000	304000	She did one of the voices in the Old Republic.
304000	306000	I know she seems to turn up in a lot of video.
306000	308000	She was in Wreck-It Ralph.
308000	311000	She did background noises, but still she was a part of it.
311000	314000	So, you know, she's a very, very prominent game actor.
314000	323000	So, Bobby actually had her on the show tonight and was kind enough to name drop Jamie's Tumblr all about Mass Effect.
323000	326000	It's masseffecting.tumblr.com.
326000	327000	Blood, blood, blood, blood.
327000	331000	And you can find the link to my other Tumblr there, too. My main Tumblr.
331000	337000	But lots of activity on the Mass Effect blogs everywhere this week because of the last DLC, Sad Face.
337000	338000	Yeah.
338000	339000	That was on Tuesday.
339000	341000	The wank has been enormous.
341000	343000	Absolutely.
343000	344000	So much wank.
344000	350000	And basically, yes, the Citadel DLC has been like everybody's fanfiction ever.
350000	354000	It really was just a giant glob of fanfic, wasn't it?
354000	357000	Except Tali singing WTF.
357000	358000	Well, there was a whole...
358000	362000	There's a reference where Tali...
362000	363000	What was it?
363000	368000	There's a reference to a meme about what does her sweat taste like or something like that?
368000	369000	Yeah.
369000	370000	I mean, it was...
370000	371000	There's a scene...
371000	373000	Which, A, ew.
373000	378000	I've done actually the rowdy party twice.
378000	384000	And I've done the calm hanging out party.
384000	394000	And Tali ends up hungover, like piss drunk in the bathroom just saying all kinds of random things every time you click on her.
394000	400000	If you do the rowdy party, it's grunt in the shower, talking in his sleep, quoting Scarface.
400000	401000	Scarface.
401000	403000	It is hilarious.
403000	405000	That's awesome.
405000	408000	Well, I guess we're moving into our gaming weeks.
408000	411000	All I really wanted to do at the top of the show was plug Bobby's interview.
411000	413000	Thank you, Bobby. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
413000	417000	But yeah, so obviously, Citadel, big deal for you and me being Mass Effect fans.
417000	420000	I plopped my ass in that chair right over there.
420000	424000	I was actually coincidentally working from home that day, not because of...
424000	427000	I didn't do that because of games, so I had other stuff going on.
427000	431000	So I had to just walk from the office to that chair at 4.30.
431000	436000	I plopped there and I didn't leave until 10.30 after I'd beaten everything in that DLC.
436000	439000	I didn't do it multiple times, but I played from start to finish.
439000	442000	And it was... I kind of had a case of the feels at the end.
442000	443000	Oh, I did it multiple times.
443000	445000	I bet you did.
445000	447000	But I had a case of the feels.
447000	449000	I don't know about you, but I was getting a little choked up.
449000	456000	You know what? I managed to hold everything together until that one last part when it's very ended over.
456000	458000	And then I lost my shit.
458000	461000	And then I played it again that night.
461000	464000	Which is funny because you and I are in the same boat.
464000	467000	We didn't even get into the series until a year ago.
467000	469000	I've got other friends in the same boat.
469000	475000	I mean, Becky wasn't even a gamer and she's a Thane shipper.
475000	479000	And so there were feels.
479000	481000	Oh, I bet. I bet.
481000	483000	They did that very well, by the way.
483000	485000	I didn't even romance Thane.
485000	492000	By the time I watched the third video, I was like, that was so much fan service, I came.
496000	498000	Except typical guys only once.
500000	501000	No, no, no.
501000	511000	But I've actually gone through on two playthroughs of the content with who I'm referring to as my headcanon, FemShep.
512000	519000	And then I have my primary one who is basically rehashed off of my very, very first female Shepard, my redhead.
519000	522000	If anyone has looked at my blog, it's the redhead.
522000	529000	And I have a game file saved right after Horizon, right before you go beat Tim's ass.
529000	531000	You need to be a lucid fan.
531000	536000	And so I got to do everything with that one and I did the calmer party.
536000	540000	I have now five saved files at the Tango with Garrus.
540000	541000	Just saying.
541000	545000	Which you totally don't get if you are broshep and you didn't romance.
545000	547000	I mean, it's like a totally different scene.
547000	552000	You know, I went back and watched the dude version of that one and I had to say broshep is a pretty good wingman.
552000	553000	Yeah.
553000	555000	Poor, clueless Torian.
556000	558000	Yeah, it's like totally different, huh?
558000	566000	Well, I'm also doing like this sort of thing on my Tumblr for actually evaluating all the little relationship scenes.
566000	569000	You know, I'm doing kind of a little review of that because I didn't see anybody else doing it.
569000	574000	People are pretty much sailing their own ships and I'm trying to give everybody's equal coverage.
574000	582000	So I've been actually going through there, but there is one romance in there that totally made me feel gross.
582000	586000	And that's the one nightstand with Vega.
586000	589000	Yeah, I've heard that is not a pleasant scene to watch.
589000	593000	That made me feel incredibly uncomfortable.
593000	594000	Yeah.
594000	595000	I'm not going to say gross or dirty or anything.
595000	596000	But the fandom wanted it.
596000	599000	And you know what, even the shippers don't really care for it.
599000	600000	I bet.
600000	605000	But it's what, you know, it was, it just seemed a lot of it.
605000	607000	There was some, you know, out of character stuff.
607000	608000	I mean, it was really funny.
608000	609000	It was done the right way.
609000	613000	It was in character, but fourth wall breaking kind of thing.
613000	615000	That just didn't seem in character to me.
615000	616000	What is happening to this show?
616000	618000	I mean, seriously, what is happening to this show?
618000	620000	I don't even know.
620000	623000	I like the more you talk about this DLC, the less I want to play this game.
623000	625000	And I already don't want to play it.
625000	628000	So go back in your corner and play Earth Defense Force.
628000	629000	Give us our moment.
629000	630000	It's the look.
630000	631000	Look at it this way.
631000	633000	It's the last DLC.
633000	634000	No, it's not.
634000	635000	It's not.
635000	636000	Come on.
636000	637000	It is.
637000	638000	Yeah.
638000	639000	The last DLC.
639000	640000	Whoa.
640000	647000	Hey, we've got this thing called E3 and you guys have been at the end of this.
647000	648000	Yeah.
648000	649000	Brand new Mass Effect.
649000	652000	Well, it's not going to have all the characters that they've they've.
652000	653000	Oh, who cares?
653000	655000	So emotionally attached to.
655000	659000	I already said I am dying to go to E3 and be at EA's press conference so I can break
659000	664000	down sign uncontrollably when they unveil a Mass Effect 4 and Bobby will have to hug
664000	665000	me.
665000	668000	Well, they've already said they're.
668000	669000	Whatever.
669000	670000	What?
670000	671000	Eves.
671000	672000	W hands.
672000	673000	What Eves?
673000	676000	Well, I'll tell you what's happening to the show.
676000	678000	Gamergirl in chat says, thanks to Dark Sakura.
678000	680000	I am a Mass Effect 4 lol.
680000	681000	Yes.
681000	683000	One of us.
683000	684000	Another one indoctrinated.
684000	685000	Yes.
685000	686000	You are in my cult.
686000	687000	Never.
687000	688000	I will never play.
688000	690000	Join the cult of Shepard.
690000	691000	Right, Rob?
691000	692000	Yes.
692000	693000	OK.
693000	694000	Let me ask this.
694000	699000	This is a serious question that dives into the anti mass effecting a little bit.
699000	701000	Fuck balls.
701000	703000	People didn't like the ending of Mass Effect 3.
703000	705000	So the large and whole.
705000	710000	So I don't see the DLC as a substitute ending, but it is certainly an ending.
710000	715000	Well, this make up for the lackluster original ending or even.
715000	720000	Remember, I went back and had to watch the original ending after I watched extended cut,
720000	723000	which, by the way, I still hate the synthesis ending because it's all fucking space magic.
723000	732000	But anyway, so I.
732000	740000	I actually got into discussions about this with a couple of people, and it's an apology isn't really a good word for it.
740000	743000	You know, it's more of a you know what?
743000	746000	Thank you for sticking with us. We know we might have screwed up here and there.
746000	749000	We know it wasn't quite what you wanted it to be.
749000	754000	And and I'm actually going to disagree that I didn't really care for all of the writing in three.
754000	760000	I mean, it seemed like a pretty natural progression from two, but I didn't really care for the plot in two.
760000	763000	It was great game. Don't get me wrong. It just I didn't care for.
763000	767000	I didn't care for the whole elusive man, but I thought that was just a pain.
767000	773000	But I think it was more of an acknowledgment.
773000	777000	It was it was a little bit of. Yeah, we've been paying attention.
777000	781000	Here you go. For me, it was a send off.
781000	788000	It was very much the made for TV movie that comes out like two years after the series ended.
788000	791000	You know, it was kind of like the whole let's do let's do one more hurrah.
791000	798000	Let's have the cast of Facts of Life go to Australia for one last hurrah and they get into Blair and Tootie.
799000	806000	We just hang out with Blair and Joe. It would be shipping, shipping Blair and Tootie.
808000	814000	Put that on the back of the box. Mass Effect three Citadel DLC. It was like shipping Blair and Tootie.
814000	819000	Oh, Alan, if I was going to romance Cortez, then I'd have to play a dude.
819000	822000	I'm just not feeling it. Oh, boy.
822000	828000	But going going back into it, I I really enjoyed the content.
828000	836000	I actually enjoyed it more than Omega. And really, the things I liked about Omega was I liked Nirene's character.
836000	843000	And I just thought it was cool seeing Aria be a huge bitch. And then, oh, God, Rob, you're not even OK.
843000	848000	Leviathan was OK. I really more like just the space waifu parts of that.
848000	851000	Hold on. I need some background music for while you're talking about all of this.
851000	856000	Here, hold on. I'm going to give you some background music. I'm going to smack a bitch.
856000	861000	You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life.
861000	864000	I mean, it is kind of the story about Mass Effect.
864000	867000	You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both.
867000	870000	And you ship everybody and everybody.
870000	876000	There was a comment on Tumblr where someone said Mass Effect where we're all relationships are canon.
877000	880000	And Charlotte Ray does kind of look like an asari a little bit.
880000	889000	No, no. Anyhow, but but yeah, the whole this is probably the most fun I've had in the game.
889000	892000	I mean, there's a lot of cool extra stuff like the arena is actually a lot of fun.
892000	895000	Getting to have Kasumi in my party again gives me life.
895000	899000	Did you find the secret box in the casino? I don't think so.
899000	901000	No. OK. I'm going to tell you how to everyone listen up.
901000	904000	Story time with Auntie Jamie. OK.
904000	910000	When you you know, when you go up the stairs from the bottom floor and you have the bar that's to your right,
910000	915000	that sort of semicircular bar, go to the end of it closest to the back wall.
915000	918000	There's a little device down there. Click on that one. Kasumi pops up.
918000	921000	I couldn't find that thing. It's upstairs.
921000	926000	It's in the middle level. Technically, the ground level is the flight of stairs leading into the casino.
926000	930000	Right. It is. No, it didn't show up in the middle for me. I looked everywhere for it.
930000	933000	I ran over the place and I actually found it by complete accident.
933000	939000	But I can tell you exactly where it is because Shane and I were having discussions on this because I never got the bonus Kasumi scene.
939000	944000	So but I'm actually going to go back through with my renegone, my real bitch of a character,
944000	949000	and try to do the whole content as a renegade just for fun, just for fun, just for fun.
949000	953000	All right. The people that aren't into Mass Effect are falling asleep.
953000	956000	Yep. All right. So let's shut up. I played something else.
956000	958000	Let's talk about the rest of your gaming week then. All right.
958000	960000	Dark soccer. How was your gaming week besides Mass Effect?
960000	965000	Oh, I thought we were talking about my gaming week because that was really my week.
965000	969000	That and fun employment, of course. But I played a little bit more to the moon.
969000	974000	I put it aside because like DLC after DLC kept coming out.
974000	980000	I really like the game to the moon. It's basically just a story that you, you know, click and pick up some things.
980000	984000	And that's about it. I don't really think there's any way to play the game badly,
984000	988000	but it has such a sweet story that I've really been enjoying it.
988000	990000	I'm going back and playing it quite a bit.
990000	995000	And I started on the last Tomb Raider game, the Guardian of Light,
995000	998000	since one of our listeners was kind enough to get it for me.
998000	999000	Oh, nice.
999000	1000000	I didn't get very far.
1000000	1003000	Although Guardian of Light is kind of more of a side story. It's not.
1003000	1006000	Yeah. And I wanted to check it out, you know, so.
1006000	1008000	It's a good game. It's fun.
1009000	1017000	But I mean, really, the other thing that I actually did for Mass Effect type stuff was not playing the game.
1017000	1021000	I have learned how to mod Xbox files and then how to copy.
1021000	1028000	We finally got it to work. How to get original PC save files into a temp file so that they will load on the Xbox.
1028000	1030000	You're getting into the hacking a little bit.
1030000	1031000	A little bit of the hacking.
1031000	1032000	Keeping up on Loki's turf.
1032000	1033000	But.
1033000	1034000	Only this is a game he'd never touch.
1034000	1038000	But all my stuff. I mean, basically, they are legitimately played games.
1038000	1044000	I got to where I did cheat a little bit, but I mean, I was able to recreate and save them.
1044000	1054000	And I've been able to reload head morphs on to basically, you know, how I have like my shepherds typically have NPC hair and different skin textures,
1054000	1058000	things that are in the game that all I've done is unlock them with the gibbed editor.
1058000	1067000	Well, I've managed to get head morphs saved from Xbox to get them to work on PC and get my PC head morphs working on the Xbox so that the hacked data will show up.
1067000	1071000	Basically, Becky got my shepherd to work. My red head.
1071000	1072000	Nice.
1072000	1075000	And I will link a picture in the chatroom so you can see exactly how modded she is.
1075000	1076000	All right.
1076000	1077000	So that's what I've been doing.
1077000	1078000	All right.
1078000	1081000	All right, Loki, I know you're dying to talk about a different game.
1081000	1082000	So how was your gaming week?
1082000	1085000	My game week is all right. I didn't play a whole ton of things.
1086000	1088000	Maybe I did not see stuff.
1088000	1096000	I've been playing a far cry tube and still trying to recreate the part of the map that we used to play the multiplayer map from Grand Theft Auto four,
1096000	1101000	although I'm not sure if I'm actually going to be able to do it now because I'm running out of objects.
1101000	1109000	I've used about a quarter of them already and I still have to duplicate the whole building over to another spot and then build another one.
1109000	1111000	And so I think I'm gonna run out of objects before I get the map done.
1111000	1115000	So might be a whole lot of wasted time for nothing.
1115000	1123000	And then I played I was pimping it last week, the the free bundle, which you can go online, the free bundle dot com and download free games.
1123000	1126000	And they put out like a new set of games each week or so.
1126000	1128000	And so they actually had a new set.
1128000	1130000	One of the games in it was called Zenith.
1130000	1138000	And Zenith is kind of a it's a weird game, but it's fun because it reminds me a lot of like Jet Grind Radio.
1138000	1144000	It's basically this looks like this character is wearing a cowboy hat and some sort of mech suit thing, but you skate along the ground.
1144000	1146000	You can grind on the walls and all sorts of stuff.
1146000	1148000	And it has like the story that goes along with it.
1148000	1155000	But it's just a fun game and very trippy, very stylized look to it.
1155000	1157000	But it's a lot of fun.
1157000	1160000	And it also uses the Xbox 360 controller on the PC.
1160000	1164000	So definitely go check that out if you can, because it's free.
1164000	1167000	So that's the best price.
1167000	1172000	Speaking of stuff that's on PC, I happen to there was one of those.
1172000	1177000	It wasn't the humble bundle, but it was one of the other ones.
1177000	1179000	I actually pimped it out on Twitter earlier this week.
1179000	1183000	And they had Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon as one of the games you can unlock.
1183000	1185000	So I got that for five bucks.
1185000	1193000	And even though I've already beaten it on the console, I figured, you know, I think I'd try it on PC again.
1193000	1195000	And it's fun.
1195000	1200000	I actually modded the game so it unlocked the framerate from 30 to 60.
1200000	1203000	And they have some field of view mods you can do to it.
1203000	1205000	So that's kind of fun.
1205000	1214000	And other than that, we're starting to start a co-op game on the Xbox for Borderlands.
1214000	1218000	Wanted to do Borderlands 2, but that DLC just fucked up all of our games.
1218000	1221000	So I can't really start that again.
1221000	1224000	But we're going to start seeing sort of the third again and do co-op through that.
1224000	1228000	So hopefully I can get the rest of my achievements by finishing some of the missions in different ways and stuff.
1228000	1231000	And Call of Duty.
1231000	1235000	I made a record on one of my Deathmatch games.
1235000	1237000	62 kills in 10 minutes.
1237000	1238000	That's impressive.
1238000	1239000	That's a lot of murder.
1239000	1240000	It was ridiculous.
1240000	1243000	It was like my fun house of carnage.
1243000	1246000	I had so many perks up at one time.
1246000	1248000	It was not fun for them.
1248000	1251000	That's pretty much it.
1251000	1253000	That's all I kind of played this week.
1253000	1256000	Well, actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
1256000	1259000	Jamie talks about Mass Effect. Loki talks about Grand Theft Auto.
1259000	1261000	What will Rob talk about? Wow.
1261000	1263000	Funny you should mention that.
1263000	1265000	There was a new patch in World of Warcraft this week.
1265000	1266000	5.2.
1266000	1267000	Oops.
1267000	1271000	Look, most of the talk is on my other show.
1271000	1272000	Plug plug.
1272000	1273000	Best little Horde house in Azeroth.
1273000	1274000	Plug plug.
1274000	1276000	Live Wednesday nights at VOG Network.
1276000	1277000	Plug plug.
1277000	1279000	But I'll just quickly say yes, I explored the new patch.
1279000	1282000	A big part of the patch is that there's a new island.
1282000	1284000	Lots more dailies to do.
1284000	1290000	Which I know a lot of the fandom has collectively eye rolled at how much this expansion is relying on dailies.
1290000	1294000	But these really aren't so bad except for the fact that it's super crowded.
1294000	1296000	So the best way to do dailies, group up with friends.
1296000	1300000	So most every weeknight, like later at night, 10, 11.
1300000	1305000	Myself, Alan, Shane, and Evan who's in our Horde house guild for the other show.
1305000	1307000	We've been grouping up to do dailies every night.
1307000	1309000	And it's so much easier that way.
1309000	1311000	And just kind of looking at the new content.
1311000	1313000	Lots of little fan service-y things.
1313000	1317000	Much easier to get Elder Charms and Spirits of Harmony.
1317000	1319000	And there's this treasure room now.
1319000	1323000	So like you can get a key and you go on this quest to go on a solo scenario.
1323000	1326000	So it's actually a legit solo instance.
1326000	1327000	And it's a treasure room.
1327000	1330000	And it's just, there's all these traps everywhere.
1330000	1333000	But you have five minutes to grab as much treasure as you can.
1333000	1336000	Oh my god, it's that part from that video game show that I liked.
1336000	1337000	Where you had the Velcro vest?
1337000	1340000	Yes, they like turned that into a scenario in WoW.
1340000	1341000	Okay, I have to play again.
1341000	1342000	And there's like statues.
1342000	1344000	Is leveling any faster?
1344000	1346000	No, they didn't reduce the XP or anything.
1346000	1349000	I think there might be new heirlooms, I could be wrong though.
1349000	1356000	That's so stolen also from Borderlands, the secret armory of General Knox.
1356000	1358000	Same situation.
1358000	1363000	Well, you know what, Warcraft is really great at taking a lot of pop culture stuff and kind of implementing it in their game.
1363000	1367000	I mean, you know, it's part of what's made the game last as long as it has.
1367000	1369000	So that's all I'll say about World of Warcraft.
1369000	1371000	But yes, I've been enjoying the new patch.
1371000	1373000	Probably won't get to enjoy the new raid though.
1373000	1374000	I hear it's pretty tough.
1374000	1377000	So we'll see when the LFR version opens up next week.
1377000	1380000	Other games I've been playing.
1380000	1382000	Talked about Mass Effect Citadel already.
1382000	1384000	Not going to go back to that territory.
1384000	1389000	But I will say, you know, plopped myself down on the couch, played it start to finish.
1390000	1395000	I can't remember the last time a video game kind of just, like, commanded my attention like that.
1395000	1399000	So, you know, I know Mass Effect has its haters, but...
1399000	1401000	And they can leave. No, I'm kidding.
1401000	1407000	No, you can stay, but just realize that, you know, Shane and I were talking about it, you know, after we'd both beaten it.
1407000	1415000	And he said, you know, yes, I can replay the DLC over and over again because it's a lot like Battlestar Galactica, which I can watch over and over again.
1415000	1417000	You know what I think? I think that's a decent comparison.
1417000	1422000	It's like, the Mass Effect plot is a really good sci-fi show, like Battlestar Galactica.
1422000	1424000	But even that show has its haters too, so whatever.
1424000	1425000	The wank, Rob. The wank.
1425000	1426000	The wank.
1426000	1428000	Okay, other stuff. Brand new game.
1428000	1430000	This is a busy week for games.
1430000	1435000	I didn't even touch SimCity, which is the game everybody's talking about this week, and I don't think any of us did.
1435000	1436000	And I just...
1436000	1437000	Because I'm smart.
1437000	1439000	Well, I just, I didn't care.
1439000	1442000	Like, I haven't really played a SimCity game since...
1442000	1444000	I didn't even like SimCity 2000, to be honest.
1444000	1448000	I loved the Super Nintendo one, and the original one on PC was awesome.
1448000	1454000	And we always joke about the CD-ROM remake, but, you know, I never really got into the future SimCity games.
1454000	1457000	Three, four, I didn't really care for them.
1457000	1461000	So, when they said there was a new one and it was going to rely on your friend's input and all, like...
1461000	1468000	All this hubba-buh-buh-buh about DRM aside, which I know is a story coming up later on, we'll get into, but all that crap aside, it's like...
1468000	1470000	I just wasn't interested in the game.
1471000	1476000	Is that so wrong? That it's just a game I didn't seem interested in?
1476000	1478000	When these things cost 60 bucks a pop?
1478000	1480000	It's okay, I didn't care either.
1480000	1483000	Alright, so you know what I did spend my $60 on?
1483000	1484000	Tomb Raider.
1484000	1491000	Which in some ways was a leap of faith, because, real talk, Tomb Raider series, last few games, a little stale, right?
1491000	1493000	Last few games, all been reboots.
1494000	1501000	So, now they really have rebooted Tomb Raider, and this was, honestly, it's the kick in the ass the series needed.
1501000	1503000	It's, it's...
1505000	1506000	It's intense.
1506000	1511000	Have you ever seen, I know I've brought up this movie on OLR before, but it's the best comparison I can honestly think of.
1511000	1513000	Have you ever seen a movie called The Descent?
1513000	1516000	Scariest movie I've ever seen in my entire life.
1516000	1519000	And it's probably because I saw it on the big screen, and not everybody's going to agree with me.
1519000	1529000	But it was like, it was, it's the story about this girl who has a tragic family thing happen, so her girlfriends, they're all really big into exploring caves.
1529000	1536000	So they go into a cave, and they find this whole, like, underground, like they get trapped in there, and they're trying to find their way out, but they're not alone.
1536000	1546000	It's just, it is a tense movie, and the entire side, it's like, you are just sitting on the edge of your seat going, and like, at the end of the movie, you just have to unclench.
1547000	1549000	Seriously, it's like that tense.
1549000	1557000	Okay, Tomb Raider is a lot like that, because like, right from the get-go, I mean, you've all seen the little cutscene that the game starts with, the same thing they showed at E3, da da da.
1557000	1560000	But then it's like, it don't stop.
1560000	1572000	It's like, it's a cave-in, and now there's people on this island that are chasing you, and now, like, you start to just feel bad for Lara Croft, because bad things won't stop happening to her.
1573000	1585000	Do you remember the early, early leaks about Tomb Raider said it was a survival horror? Do you remember they leaked several years ago that this was happening, that Tomb Raider was getting rebooted, and it was going to be a survival horror game?
1585000	1586000	I don't remember that.
1586000	1610000	A lot of people kind of lost the survival horror thing, but there's a lot in common with, like, a lot of, like, jump scares, oh shit moments, like, I'm walking along the path, da da da, I've got to get to this, I've got to get to this radio tower so I can be in the transmission, I've got to go, I've got to go, I'm running, I'm running, and fuck, I'm in a spring trap, and like, now I'm hanging upside down, having to kill guards, like, it's just, like, it's like non-stop, like, stuff like that.
1610000	1631000	So, um, and on top of that, the game is kind of like a, and one of my friends said it was, like, Metroidvania type of, and I was like, really? But the more I played it, I'm like, it kind of does have that whole Metroid vibe to it, where you can fast travel back to different parts of the game you've done before, it's a giant world map, the island, and there's just hidden shit all over.
1632000	1657000	Relics, documents, GPS things you find, and just, like, like, you know, you get items that will allow you to access new areas, which is, like, a key component to, you know, any Metroid game, right, the ice beam allows you to freeze enemies and get to new parts, well, there's a rope arrow thing that you get that allows you to create rope bridges to places you couldn't access before, so, um, yeah.
1658000	1659000	It's like Link's grappling hook.
1659000	1669000	Kind of, yeah. So, I'm only about a third of the way through the game, honestly, just, you know, and I haven't even touched multiplayer, but the experience has been very good so far.
1670000	1685000	I would say maybe the only reservation some people may have is that I'm a third of the way through the game, and I've only been playing for about four hours, maybe four and a half, so the single player campaign appears to be 12 hours, maybe 15 hours tops, if you're very meticulous about everything.
1686000	1697000	So, just kind of, you know, for a $60 game, take that with a grain of salt, but, you know, it's a, it's a very, doesn't let up, um, 15 hours.
1698000	1706000	The tomb raiding is optional, which I know has said a lot of people's kind of been giving them a question mark, like, okay, what the hell is a tomb raider game where you're not actually raiding tombs?
1707000	1726000	Well, here's the deal. There's these hidden tombs that you'll find, and you can go inside, and it's basically a giant puzzle, and if you solve the puzzle, you get a treasure chest at the end that will not only give you, like, maybe an upgrade for your bow, or, you know, something like that, but it will also reveal random things on your main map that you may have missed.
1727000	1738000	Like, you missed this relic here, you missed this document here, and dah, dah, dah, dah. So, yes, the tomb raiding is optional, but if you're going to go for 100% completion rate, that stuff's going to go a very long way in doing so, so, you know.
1739000	1746000	And again, I haven't even touched multiplayer, haven't heard good things about it, but I want to refrain from making further comment until I've actually had a chance to try it myself.
1747000	1756000	I really don't want to play with strangers. I want to try to get some VoG people. Anybody got Tomb Raider for 360? Because we need to have a night on Tomb Raider pretty soon.
1757000	1762000	What else do I see about Tomb Raider? There was another negative thing I had to say. Oh, here's the negative.
1763000	1788000	I want to find whoever invented the shaky cam technique and punch them in the face. There's a lot of shaky cam, especially in the beginning of the game. It's lessened itself a little bit now that we're, you know, a little ways in the game, but the very beginning of the game had a lot of shaky cam, and, like, I don't usually get sick playing video games, but I was, like, going, like, I had to close my eyes and look down and listen and be, like, fucking stop with the shaky cam.
1789000	1790000	I think that person works for MTV.
1791000	1809000	Perhaps. So I want to be able to turn that fucking shaky cam off. Like, it's just, it's in some of the cut scenes where I'm just, like, okay, I get that you're trying to build intensity and drama, but, like, you're building stomach acid in my stomach, and I'm about to barf from all this, so stop.
1810000	1819000	But, you know, I can always look away. It didn't detract from the game as a whole, but I did want to kind of just point that out, like, stop. Stop shaky cam. Stop it.
1821000	1828000	Dungeonbuster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, thanks a lot, Blair Witch. That's from Dungeonbuster.
1828000	1833000	Degenerate Johnny says, shaky cam equals JJ Abrams. Yeah, thanks a lot, JJ Abrams.
1834000	1839000	Tigerclaw says, Rob, any lens flares? No, not that I've seen. Not that I've seen. You do get a torch.
1840000	1849000	Shaky cam's more of, it wasn't, maybe it wasn't Michael Bay. It was the guy that did Gladiator. Remember, Gladiator was very shaky cam, too, and that kind of got popular after that.
1850000	1858000	Ragenator in chat says, there's one thing missing from Tomb Raider games, a full-on lesbian scene. Oh, you silly boys.
1859000	1870000	Tigerclaw says, I hear you can play the entire game using just the bow. Hypothetically, I guess you could. It's more fun to use the machine gun, but okay. Play however you want.
1870000	1877000	Dungeonbuster also says, it's a torrent of bad news that never ends for Croft in the reboot. It's great.
1878000	1888000	Yeah, you know, all these things you were hearing about in the preamp about how you will see how Lara Croft had to toughen up and all this. It's like, yeah, yeah, I can see it. I can definitely see it.
1889000	1893000	Alright, anyhow, that's enough. That's all I want to say about Tomb Raider for now. I'll let you know more when I actually beat the game.
1894000	1905000	Let's get to housekeeping tonight. Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and we're on Google+.
1906000	1913000	I don't think we have anything else really big coming up show-wise. I should go ahead. I was going to do this at the end of the show, but I'll plug it now.
1914000	1920000	Next week on the show, an old friend of ours is going to be back to visit, and the cool thing is he's actually going to be here live in studio. He's driving in from the Bay Area.
1920000	1930000	It's our pal Seg. You may remember Seg is one of the masterminds behind Umlaud, the charity event, Rock Band Night for Child's Play, in December.
1931000	1940000	So we're going to talk to Seg about some of the stuff that he's doing when it's not December, because even though I'm sure planning Umlaud takes all year, he's really not in that mode right now so much.
1941000	1948000	He's working on some other projects, and we're going to talk to him about that, and one of the big, big things we're going to talk to him about is starting your own game studio.
1948000	1951000	Which, Dark Soccer, you've actually been involved with this a little bit as well, right?
1952000	1953000	I've done logo design.
1954000	1964000	Yeah, for Seg's project. So we're going to talk to Seg about starting a gaming studio and what his whole vision is and all that, and we'll talk to him next week about that. Looking forward to having him.
1965000	1968000	You should have heard me yell at my computer.
1969000	1970000	What, the designing?
1970000	1980000	I would get one thing perfect, and it was missing something, so I would go back and try to re-tweak it and lose everything I did, and it was awful, and I would scream obscenities.
1981000	1988000	Well, but you worked your way through it, so we'll interview Seg about any obscenities he may or may not have yelled.
1989000	1990000	I didn't yell any at him, because he's nice.
1991000	1998000	I know, I know, he is very nice. Okay, anyhow, let's get into gaming news then. We will start off with Loki, with what's going on in gaming news this week.
1998000	2011000	Uh, so there's a lot of stuff coming out about Steam Box. If they were showing some of those piston computers and stuff, man, a thousand dollars for that thing. Nope, not gonna buy it.
2011000	2026000	But yeah, the Xi3 is one of the first Steam Box computers, or third-party Steam Boxes, not necessarily something made by Steam, or Valve, but it's to spec, I guess.
2027000	2036000	I don't know, but a thousand dollars, man, for something that's just a really small form factor, I would just spend probably less than that and make something even better spec-wise.
2036000	2042000	And who cares if it takes up a little extra space. You know, full tower, you can put it inside of a TV stand, you'll never notice it.
2043000	2054000	But one of the things that they're saying they could do is that the Steam Box could actually expand the PC landscape, and this is according to the hardware manufacturer MSI.
2055000	2059000	They do a lot of third-party graphics cards and motherboards.
2059000	2074000	But basically, it's kind of expanding the PC landscape in terms of slowly pushing the gap between the average console user that may not ever want to touch a PC versus some of the hardcore PC gamers that will never want to touch a console.
2075000	2084000	Basically, if we can get more users to accept the fact that, hey, you can buy a PC and have incremental upgrades, that would be a big impact on the gaming performance.
2085000	2092000	And if people actually realize that, then that would expand the PC gaming market by several magnitudes.
2093000	2104000	See, now, I kind of agree with that. I've kind of, aside from my laptop being able to play a little bit more recent games, my older laptop, I actually spent like, I want to say $1,700 on the thing.
2104000	2109000	I mean, it was pretty beefy at the time because of the max-out crisis pretty well.
2110000	2118000	But then like two years later, it's just junk because you'd have to upgrade everything in order to be able to play something on it.
2119000	2129000	That's the only thing that kind of holds a lot of people back, I guess, from buying a PC to game on is because, oh hey, cool, I've got this awesome PC I spent a lot of money on.
2129000	2136000	Oh crap, now I've got to buy another $300 graphics card. Oh, now I've got to buy some more RAM. Oh, I need the upgradement processor.
2137000	2141000	Well, the upgradement processor, I've got to upgrade my motherboard. And now I've got to buy another graphics card.
2142000	2144000	Wouldn't that also just randomly go with a regular PC anyway?
2145000	2153000	That's what I'm saying. I'm talking PC in general, I'm not necessarily saying Steam boxes. I'm just saying that that's what holds people back a lot of times.
2153000	2166000	And I think originally with the Steam box, it was kind of this, okay, listen, we're going to put out this thing that's going to cost an X amount of money and it's going to be able to run everything on Steam or whatever these games are going to be.
2167000	2173000	Also, they're saying that Valve is actually going to be sharing some of the Steam box prototypes within the next few months.
2174000	2183000	They're going to be giving them to customers or developers or whatever, but I guess they're going to be out there in the next few months, so we'll hopefully get to see some of those prototypes.
2184000	2192000	And hey, if you happen to be interested in the piston, you can get $100 off of it right now. That's right, $100.
2193000	2214000	And then it'll run you, what, $999? I don't know. And also, you can get an extra 128GB solid state drive for, or I guess you upgrade the 128GB solid state drive to 512GB for $750. That's really nice.
2214000	2226000	Yeah, seriously, if you're going to make a PC that's going to run on your TV, just build a PC because all graphics cards nowadays, they output the HDMI, just shove it next to your TV, done.
2227000	2230000	No need to pay extra money for this really small PC.
2231000	2236000	We've had a computer hooked up to our TV for the past seven years. Oops.
2236000	2243000	All right. Well, we are going to switch gears here a little bit before we get into the next story.
2244000	2252000	You know, Orange Lawns Radio, it is the show where every gamer has a voice, and many of these voices are going to be coming together at PAX East next week.
2253000	2257000	Or is it next weekend? No, it's in two weeks. I don't even know.
2258000	2259000	Soon.
2259000	2265000	Soon. The very gaming term of soon. We're on the wrong coast. I wish I was going.
2266000	2278000	But we have one of the folks that's going to be at PAX East. I want to bring onto the show, it's somebody kind of special, somebody well known, not just for her cosplay, but for a very cool achievement of sorts when it comes to the Omega-thon with PAX.
2279000	2284000	So I want to give our buddy, and this is one of Rama's buddies, I'm very excited he let us have her on the show.
2284000	2290000	Our buddy from Anime Jam Session, Plug Plug Tuesday Nights. This is Pork Buns, but we can call her Tina.
2291000	2296000	And we're going to get her on the line right now and talk a little bit about PAX East and what's going on.
2297000	2298000	She sounds delicious.
2299000	2300000	Hey Tina, you there?
2301000	2302000	Yes I am. And I heard that bit about me being delicious.
2303000	2305000	Well, Pork Buns are delicious. Magically delicious.
2306000	2307000	Yes they are.
2308000	2309000	Well welcome to the show, Tina. How are you doing?
2309000	2315000	I'm doing alright. I am slightly exhausted from sculpting for eight hours, but I think I'll be fine.
2316000	2317000	What exactly are you sculpting?
2318000	2327000	I am sculpting the mask for Corvo from Dishonored, and I'm doing a clay sculpt of it before I do a mold of it and then cast it.
2328000	2334000	Now, my understanding is that, and you'll have to excuse me, I'm on the wrong coast, so I don't get to a lot of cons on the East Coast,
2335000	2340000	but my understanding is you do some real bang up awesome cosplay at a lot of the East Coast cons.
2341000	2345000	Is there some characters that you've done that folks may recognize you as, our East Coast listeners?
2346000	2354000	I think most people know me as the Amon from Legend of Korra. I know that's been passed around a lot.
2355000	2361000	And I've also done the Journey cosplay from the PSN, the PSN indie hit.
2362000	2363000	Oh, of course.
2364000	2366000	So I've done that, and I've also designed a tutorial so people might know me from that too.
2367000	2368000	Basically no one sees my face.
2371000	2374000	But I see your face on Skype right now. It's a pretty face. You should show it.
2375000	2382000	Now, Journey on PlayStation Network, am I right? You actually got complimented on this by some important people, right?
2383000	2390000	Yes, we got a feature done. Me and my friends, Chris, Morgan, Kate, and Nicole, we got featured on Kotaku,
2391000	2395000	and we've also gotten some attention from the company that made it, which is That Game Company,
2396000	2404000	and of course the Grammy nominated composer, Austin Wintory. So we got some buzz for that, which was really nice.
2405000	2411000	That is amazing. Especially, you know, a lot of people have been talking about Austin Wintory and the whole Grammy nomination.
2412000	2416000	I mean, Journey has just been the game of the year, and everybody's wanted a piece of their time.
2417000	2421000	So for them to acknowledge you like, hey, this girl does some awesome cosplay, that's got to feel great.
2422000	2426000	Oh, yeah, absolutely. And it's even better when no one can see my face.
2427000	2433000	All my popular cosplays, so-called popular cosplays, no one ever sees my face.
2433000	2437000	Is that a trademark thing? You sound very proud of that, that nobody sees your face.
2438000	2443000	I do, I do, because I feel like I give, I take away that control for someone to judge how good I look,
2444000	2449000	and I'm just like, well, you can't judge because there's something covering my face. So I'm forced you to look at my craftsmanship.
2450000	2455000	Actually, I have a friend who has a, and had an excellent costume, but it was, um,
2455000	2461000	go as a larva at AX for a few years in a row, and had an excellent costume.
2462000	2465000	But it was from Vampire Princess Miyu, I don't know if you've seen it, Rob.
2466000	2467000	No, no.
2468000	2475000	But yeah, she used to do a larva costume just for the sake of showing off the good costume and not having to, you know, with the mask and everything.
2476000	2480000	Yeah, exactly, because I feel like when people, when you have your face out there,
2480000	2486000	people tend to look at whether you look similar to the character, whether you're good looking, whether you're bad looking,
2487000	2491000	if there's any kind of flaws in your face, and I just take that control from people when I have a mask costume,
2492000	2493000	so that's why it's my favorite thing to do.
2494000	2498000	That's a very powerful way of looking at it, I'm just like, I'm kind of like, that's a neat way to look at it.
2499000	2503000	Throw it the opposite way with my bikin costume a few years ago, I showed off my rack so no one would look at my face.
2504000	2506000	I don't know if that's the same thing there.
2507000	2508000	My husband hated that costume.
2508000	2516000	Well, let me ask this, because I know, I get a little, I see where the cosplay community has got to find this irritating,
2517000	2523000	but you know there's those websites and they do nothing but they go to cons and they take pictures of, and I'm using my air quotes,
2524000	2532000	hot chicks and, you know, dressed as Mai and Chun Li, not that there's anything wrong with that, you know, those are great characters and so forth,
2532000	2538000	but, you know, when you focus on that, like, that's not cool, right?
2539000	2545000	Well, to each their own and, you know, for people who can show off their body and they're comfortable with that,
2546000	2549000	that's fantastic, really, really fantastic for them, I'm just not that kind of person,
2550000	2558000	and I like to be as, kind of, float by and have people just recognize me for my craftsmanship because that's what I really care about, so.
2558000	2562000	Well, I don't like to show off my body either and the internet is very thankful for that, so.
2563000	2564000	So are the rest of us, Rob.
2565000	2569000	I've actually checked out some of your costumes, I think that your work is impeccable.
2570000	2574000	Actually, I wanted to ask you about something. Have you seen that material that they put out that's in the jar?
2575000	2582000	What's that stuff called? It's like $10 and it's supposed to be, not like Sculpey, but you pour it in the mold and you'll bake it,
2583000	2587000	and it's supposed to be really inexpensive. I was actually wondering if you had an opinion about that or if you've ever used it.
2588000	2593000	No, I don't think I've actually heard of a material like that, but it sounds really interesting and I would love to give it a try.
2594000	2599000	I posted something about it a long time ago on my Tumblr, I'll have to find it for you, but what do you usually do for your sculpts?
2600000	2601000	Do you do like a vinyl or resin or?
2602000	2606000	Actually, this is the first time I've done a clay and mold thing.
2607000	2612000	For most of my masks, I used to use a combination of a thermoplastic, for example, like Wonderflex,
2612000	2620000	or the new popular material right now, Worbla, and put paper clay on top of it, which is basically a very, very fine paper mache.
2621000	2629000	But for this mask that I'm making, what I'm doing is I'm actually taking a modeling clay so it never dries,
2630000	2638000	and I'm going to do a brush-on rubber silicone mold and I'm going to cast it out of, I believe it's a resin, I'm not exactly sure, it's called Smoothcast.
2638000	2645000	It's a really lightweight, very, very durable material, it's really, really hard to sand though, so I'm not looking forward to that.
2646000	2653000	I haven't done cons in quite a while, but I told you this before, Rob, I'm actually planning on doing a Shepard cosplay myself.
2654000	2655000	Oh my.
2656000	2663000	But I have a friend who is a ceramic sculptor, and I was actually going to have her make my helmet and part of a ceramic.
2664000	2665000	That sounds pretty good, yeah.
2666000	2667000	Are you a Mass Effect fan, Tina?
2668000	2669000	I'm a huge Mass Effect fan.
2670000	2671000	Are you on Tumblr?
2672000	2673000	Another one.
2674000	2675000	I am on Tumblr, yes.
2676000	2677000	We'll have to talk later.
2678000	2679000	Your Mass Effect fans do nothing for me, I don't care.
2680000	2687000	You know what, Tina, that's the reason we were running late tonight, is the guy before us here at VOG Network tonight had an interview with Jennifer Hale, and we couldn't shut up about it.
2688000	2689000	That's why we were running late.
2690000	2691000	I had some serious sand girl ink.
2692000	2693000	That's understandable.
2693000	2715000	Alright, well Tina, something else I want to talk to you about, which I'm sure we definitely have our listeners that are into cosplay and so forth, but there might be some that don't follow that as much, but they're certainly following what's going on at the various conventions, and we're going to have quite a few people and listeners that are going to be at PAX East who are going to get to see you participate in this year's Omega-thon, right?
2716000	2717000	Yes, that's correct.
2717000	2723000	You are one of the Omega-nauts for the Omega-thon, but what people may not know, or maybe they do, is that this is not going to be your first time at the rodeo, right?
2724000	2728000	No, unfortunately not. They're dragging me back into the fire because I was a runner-up last year.
2729000	2738000	Ah, so Tina was actually the runner-up of last year's Omega-thon, and if I am not mistaken, I have heard that you are the first female to make the finals.
2739000	2740000	Actually, that is untrue.
2741000	2742000	Oh, no.
2742000	2760000	I am only the second female to make Omega-thon. The record was broken by Cassandra Leis two years ago, so she made it to the finals, too, and I was only the second one to make it, and then there was another female that made it to the finals for this Prime, and I believe she was the first one for Prime.
2761000	2771000	Somebody lied to me, but you know what? It still does not lessen the girl power any, so that's three PAXes in a row, so, I mean, congratulations, right?
2772000	2773000	Yeah, absolutely.
2774000	2779000	So, what was the game that unfortunately knocked you out of contention last year? What was it?
2780000	2791000	This game called Crokinole. It's a, well, it's a Canadian game, and the best way I can describe it is like hand-curling. It's like curling, but you're using your fingers instead.
2791000	2808000	And what happened was we were head-to-head for a while, and unfortunately, my partner, Michael Toland, he had done one shot that gave them 30 points, like, off the bat, and they won it, and we were like, oh, well, that's what happens. You don't play a game, like, ever.
2809000	2819000	What was your reaction when the game was unveiled? Because it's always a mystery what the big last game is going to be at the Omega-thon, and it's always unveiled right at the last minute.
2820000	2825000	While you're there on stage, what was your reaction when they showed, oh, it's this obscure Canadian, it's not even a freaking video game?
2826000	2835000	No, it isn't. Well, before, what they did was they teased us beforehand by playing the Canadian national anthem, which they had Jonathan Coulton sing for us.
2836000	2837000	I love him.
2838000	2847000	No, I love him, too. And we were watching it, and we were just like, oh, crap, what the hell is it? And when they revealed it, I think we all looked at each other as, like, what the F?
2849000	2860000	Like, we were all dressed up really mobile, just in case it was a mobile game or something, and we were all having, like, we were like, oh, is it a video game? Is it going to be the claw machine? Is it going to be something obscure?
2861000	2865000	And we looked at each other, and we were like, I don't have any clue what the hell this is.
2865000	2867000	So you just had to roll with it.
2868000	2874000	Yeah, I mean, we all had to roll with it, and, you know, apparently we gave them a good show because it was pretty much head to head up until the toad.
2875000	2887000	Is that tough to do in that arena where there's just all those people, or are you able to just block it out and be like, I gotta focus on the game, or does that, is that really just a huge distraction when it's all those people?
2887000	2898000	Well, I'm used to being on stage in much more embarrassing situations because I've been in cosplay skits and cosplay events and stuff, and, yeah, it wasn't as hard.
2899000	2903000	So it's like all your years of cosplaying helped you prepare for that moment.
2904000	2916000	I was hamming it up, though. I was giving, like, Hunger Games signs, like the three finger salute to people in the front, and people were, like, cheering for me, starting chants and stuff. It was really fun.
2917000	2919000	And may the odds be ever in your favor.
2920000	2921000	Pretty much.
2922000	2926000	So do you know what games are going to be involved with this Omega-Thon at PAX East in a couple weeks?
2927000	2943000	Yes. They revealed it to us last week. The first one is Bomberman, the live version, the one that's on Xbox Live Arcade. The second one is NBA Jam, also the On Fire edition. And then the third round is Jenga.
2944000	2953000	Oh, no. Yeah, they usually throw a board game or something in there. I've seen Jenga before. So what are you doing to prepare? Are you preparing at all, or are you just, like, eh, I'm going to wing it?
2954000	2956000	I'd be perfect. I'd be perfect for Fortnite.
2957000	2970000	I was actually just practicing with my friends. I have a friend named Norm who is a tournament winner of Bomberman, so he's been coaching me, and all we're really missing is Eye the Tiger playing in the background.
2970000	2989000	But I'm terrible. I'm terrible right now. I have just made a pass not killing myself, and Jenga I don't think I can prepare for at all, and NBA Jam I'm going to move on to as soon as I feel like I don't suck abysmally at Bomberman.
2990000	2993000	Can I give you a hint on Jenga that doesn't involve Ibuprofen?
2994000	2995000	Sure.
2996000	2997000	Practice with your left hand.
2997000	3000000	That's a good, that's a very good tip. I'll have to practice that.
