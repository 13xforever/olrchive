7000	14000	Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, March 3, 2013, two companies promise new games at PAX East.
19000	22000	Gran Turismo 6 will be out before year's end.
22000	27000	And could Shenmue 3 happen via Kickstarter?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 495 for this March the 3rd of 2013.
46000	50000	We're here to talk about video games and gaming and gaming culture with my co-host.
50000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts. Over here is DarkSakura.
53000	54000	Hi.
54000	56000	How are you, DarkSakura? Welcome back tonight.
56000	57000	Thank you.
57000	59000	You're welcome. Hope you're feeling better.
59000	60000	Yes.
60000	63000	As you said before the show, because you were looking at the show and you said,
63000	66000	495, why have we been doing this for 495 weeks?
66000	70000	And I said, chicks. To get chicks.
70000	71000	Yeah.
71000	73000	It hasn't worked.
73000	74000	I did have chicken the other day.
74000	78000	Hello over there, tech master Loki, who claims it has not worked.
78000	79000	Nah, it hasn't worked.
79000	82000	It has not worked.
82000	87000	Well, you've been, how long have you and Nelly been together since the start of OLR, right?
87000	88000	You guys were together around there.
88000	89000	Yeah, around there.
89000	90000	Wow, so.
90000	91000	I think 2001.
91000	92000	And you and Dan have been together that long too.
92000	94000	Well, we've been together for 15 years.
94000	95000	Oh my gosh.
95000	97000	As of the 23rd of January.
97000	102000	This show just, you know, fosters long-term relationships.
102000	106000	Meanwhile, over the course of the show, I think I've had four or five different.
106000	109000	I did get married after we started the show.
109000	111000	But the one I'm on is the last one.
111000	112000	Cause he's listening.
112000	113000	So you know he's a keeper.
113000	115000	Cause he's, you know, supportive and all that stuff.
115000	116000	Right?
116000	124000	Yes, and he's officially my hero for re-reblogging one of my posts on my Mass Effect blog.
124000	125000	Cause I totally agree with him.
125000	129000	Oh, you guys and your Mass Effect lolsy stuff.
129000	130000	Hey, you know what?
130000	131000	Huh?
131000	133000	You were talking about Shitadel earlier.
135000	138000	Are we already dogging the DLC before anybody's played it?
138000	140000	Yeah, that's just my special nickname for the Citadel.
140000	141000	Oh, okay.
141000	142000	The Shitadel?
142000	143000	That's very clever.
143000	144000	That's very creative.
144000	145000	Yeah, Becky and I call it that sometimes.
145000	146000	Funny you.
146000	150000	I was going to do a kickoff topic for the start of the show tonight.
150000	152000	But I didn't really have a lot going on.
152000	155000	I thought I would give a cheap plug to Bobby.
155000	157000	He's always up before us.
157000	160000	We do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,
160000	164000	every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right before Bobby Black Wolf.
164000	168000	And on his show tonight, a really cool interview with Ken Allen.
168000	171000	You may not recognize that name, but I'm sure you recognize his work.
171000	174000	Especially if you're like a 30-something or a late 20-something.
174000	176000	You probably played Sierra Adventure games back in the day.
176000	180000	Yeah, he was a composer for Space Quest, the old Space Quest games.
180000	182000	I have a confession, Rob.
182000	183000	What's that?
183000	184000	I really didn't play many of them.
184000	185000	Yeah, what's up with that?
185000	187000	What were you playing in the early 90s?
187000	188000	Were you strictly console?
188000	191000	I was strictly console, except for my addiction to Doom.
191000	199000	When I hit my last year of high school and beginning of college, I was really into Doom and Descent.
199000	200000	Interesting.
200000	206000	And I did like Phantasmagoria, but I played the LucasArts games.
206000	207000	I played Loom.
207000	209000	Okay, well that was all kind of around that same time.
209000	214000	Yeah, it was around that same time, but I just wasn't as into it myself.
214000	215000	Oh God, I love to be-
215000	216000	I was a console girl.
216000	223000	I will admit, I was not as into Space Quest as I was in the Hero's Quest, and especially King's Quest.
223000	226000	That series was so amazing to me.
226000	231000	I think everybody remembers King's Quest IV, Rosella, because that's the one that incorporates all the old fairy tales and stuff.
231000	233000	Oh my gosh, great, great classic game.
233000	234000	I just didn't get into them.
234000	242000	I think the only real thing I played on a PC before that were the text-based, like Gemstone.
242000	245000	And then of course your favorite, Civilization, the old school one.
245000	247000	I got into that early on.
247000	249000	I was never into Civ.
249000	253000	I should give a plug for this. I'm curious what you guys think about this.
253000	261000	Microsoft is doing a huge sale on their Games on Demand right now, where you can get a lot of these, not really a lot of new stuff.
261000	267000	I think there were some things in there like Borderlands 2 and stuff, but mostly a couple years old games from the archives.
267000	271000	But it's like $9.99 for most of these games that are on sale right now.
272000	274000	Borderlands 2 is a little more and some of the other current ones.
274000	279000	But for the most part, you're getting games that still retail for $30-$40 for $9.99.
279000	282000	A lot of people calling it Microsoft's answer to a Steam sale.
282000	285000	And in some ways, it's kind of accurate.
285000	287000	Today, the reason why I brought it up was Civilization.
287000	293000	Civilization Revolution, one of those games that's only $10 right now, which I think is a great buy.
293000	296000	I think it's a great enabler for the Civ series.
296000	299000	So if I was going to try and get Jamie into Civ, I would be all like,
299000	303000	Poke, poke, here's a $10 gift card. Poke, poke, here's what you go spend it on. Poke, poke.
303000	305000	But I know that won't work, so I'm not even going to bother.
305000	307000	I'm not giving her money.
307000	311000	If you gave me money right now, I'd probably just pay bills with it.
311000	320000	What do you guys think about Microsoft responding to this really deep cut sale thing of sorts?
320000	324000	Well, I think they're just trying to push digital sales.
324000	328000	Trying to figure out how to get people interested in that stuff.
328000	332000	And it's all about getting them more exposure.
332000	345000	Maybe kind of trying to hype up stuff as we approach a supposed announcement of some sort.
345000	352000	So maybe, I don't know, it seems to have worked for Steam and stuff to help drive sales.
352000	354000	Maybe that's why they want to hype.
354000	357000	Hey guys, you know we do sell games digitally as well, right?
357000	361000	It's not just Sony and Steam. We do that as well.
361000	364000	So hey, buy something.
364000	368000	A tiny correction to what I had stated earlier.
368000	372000	Bobby says it was Space Quest 4 was the one in the series that Ken Allen did.
373000	374000	Oops, my bad.
374000	376000	But I will say that I know this one for a fact.
376000	378000	Because Bobby and I have both fawned over this one.
378000	381000	And our mutual love of an old ass Sierra game I bet none of you have heard of.
381000	383000	It's called Jones in the Fast Lane.
383000	385000	Awesome computer game back in the day.
385000	389000	They kind of tried to make a CD-ROM game out of a board game type of thing.
389000	390000	It was really weird.
390000	395000	You had these marbles that would go around, but it was kind of like life.
395000	397000	And you would have a job.
397000	400000	It was hard for me to explain.
400000	401000	It was fun, dammit.
401000	403000	Did they ever make a board game based on that?
403000	406000	No, but you would see your little character actually walking.
406000	409000	You could pick your little CD-ROM character and they would actually walk.
409000	413000	It was back in the day when all that video capture stuff was really new on CD.
413000	416000	And then I think they had a disc version of it too
416000	420000	where it would substitute in animated characters, if I remember right.
420000	423000	So I know that was one because I loved that game growing up.
423000	427000	That was right around the same time I got into Civ and all that, in fact.
427000	429000	I want to know something, Rob.
429000	430000	What?
430000	435000	Why people on Tumblr think that I want to see animated gifs of Caden's butt.
435000	438000	Because you're following those Tumblrs.
438000	441000	It's all about what you want to follow on the tumbles.
441000	443000	Wasn't there one called Caden's Ass?
443000	445000	There's one called Shepherd's Butt.
445000	450000	It's because it's like, hey, we saw that you viewed alien penises.
450000	452000	You may like Caden's butt.
452000	456000	There's also one that's called Shepherd's Left Boob.
456000	458000	I don't know what you want me to tell you.
458000	459000	I have no idea.
459000	460000	I can't even.
460000	462000	You get out of the internet whatever you want.
462000	465000	If you want to use Tumblr for nothing but porn, you can do it very easily.
465000	467000	That's my side boob.
467000	469000	Or so I've heard.
469000	471000	And that's probably someone's Tumblr too.
471000	473000	That's my side boob.
473000	474000	That's from Family Guy.
474000	475000	I'm going to see if that exists.
475000	478000	Fuck yeah, side boob.
478000	481000	I'm pretty sure that's out there.
481000	483000	I'm looking.
483000	487000	Alright, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
487000	489000	BlackWolf, again trying to correct me here.
489000	494000	The only difference between the disc and CD version was the CD version had full spoken audio.
494000	496000	The animated characters were still there.
496000	502000	I thought in the CD version they were actual digitized characters and in the disc one they were cartoons.
502000	503000	And on the disc version they-
503000	504000	Yes it exists.
504000	506000	There is a fuck yes I boob Tumblr.
506000	509000	And on the disc version it came on like 48 discs, right?
509000	511000	Because that's the equivalent of a CD.
511000	514000	The disc version of Jones I think was only like four.
514000	516000	Like four discs or so.
516000	517000	I remember, what was it?
517000	518000	Willy Beamish I think it was.
518000	521000	Was a game I was playing way back in the day.
521000	522000	I remember that game.
522000	524000	It was on like 12 discs.
524000	527000	Yeah, I had an anime fighting game.
527000	530000	It was called, I don't remember what it was called.
530000	531000	Something Lace.
531000	532000	I don't remember what it was called now.
532000	535000	It was like Metal and Lace or something like that.
535000	540000	I got into it like software etc. back in the day.
540000	542000	Never did get that game to run correctly.
542000	546000	But damn it took a long time with like eight plus discs installing.
546000	548000	That was the whole reason you needed a hard drive.
548000	551000	Was because you had to have something to install all those stinking discs to.
551000	554000	Eh, no the 14 disc descent.
554000	555000	Oh yeah, yeah.
555000	556000	Ugh.
556000	559000	That's where you had to have like a rubber band to bind all the discs together.
559000	560000	Good times.
560000	562000	I still have it somewhere.
562000	564000	My stack of descent discs.
564000	566000	Classic gaming, what a trip.
566000	571000	Alright, let's get into what we've been playing this week as far as modern games go.
571000	573000	Not that classics are bad by any means.
573000	576000	I mean, I've been playing Capcom Arcade a lot lately.
576000	577000	Playing classics.
577000	579000	Why don't we just start with Rob?
579000	581000	Well you, well no I was going to say, no that was last week not this week.
581000	584000	But I was going to say you missed last week and I was talking about Capcom Arcade.
584000	589000	Did you know that the freebie game that you can just get for free on Playstation 3 is Black Tiger?
589000	591000	Which you've talked about on the show before.
591000	592000	Yeah.
592000	594000	And you can flip between the Japanese and the English versions.
594000	596000	I was so excited to tell you last week and then you weren't here.
596000	599000	Uh, I think Dan might have already gotten it.
599000	600000	I don't know.
600000	601000	It's cool.
601000	602000	Yeah, it's an e-game.
602000	603000	And...
603000	604000	It's one of Dan's favorites.
604000	606000	Next week they're putting out Gun.Smoke.
606000	607000	Gun.Smoke.
607000	608000	Gun.Smoke.
608000	609000	Yeah.
609000	610000	I have a demo for Gun.Smoke.
610000	611000	It's good times.
611000	612000	Alright, we'll start with you.
612000	613000	What were you going to say?
613000	614000	Something sassy over there, Logan?
614000	618000	I wonder, you know, because now that they are allowing you to get all these weird like
618000	622000	URL names, I wonder if someday we will have Gun.Smoke.
622000	625000	As an actual URL.
625000	628000	Like a smoke dot, like a dot com or a dot...
628000	629000	Yeah, it'd be dot smoke.
629000	630000	It'd be dot smoke.
630000	633000	Like, they had it at one point where you could get pretty much anything you want.
633000	634000	Yeah, yeah.
634000	635000	So...
635000	640000	Well, I would imagine maybe cigarette companies or in Washington and Colorado, dot smoke might
640000	641000	be very popular.
641000	645000	You could get Gun.SMO.KE, like Kenya or something.
645000	646000	See, now you're thinking.
646000	647000	Now you're playing with power.
647000	648000	I'm playing internationally.
648000	651000	Alright, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
651000	652000	Mass Effect.
652000	653000	Of course.
653000	655000	No, because I got the Reckoning DLC.
655000	658000	Oh yes, the last multiplayer DLC.
658000	659000	Yeah.
659000	662000	I love your little quote fingers that no one can see.
662000	663000	Yeah, well.
663000	669000	Um, it's actually really good, although my little lore nerd in my head is going, fucking
669000	670000	collector adepts, what?
670000	672000	Yeah, that was a weird choice, wasn't it?
672000	673000	Fucking bizarre.
673000	678000	I just, it just goes to show just how crap the writing in 3 was.
678000	679000	Aww.
679000	684000	No, 3 has like some of my favorite scenes and it's my favorite to play, like actually
684000	685000	play.
686000	690000	But there's just writing in that game that makes me go, sparkly turd.
690000	692000	But the multiplayer is so good.
692000	694000	The multiplayer is fantastic.
694000	698000	You guys wonder why we don't shut up about Mass Effect 3 like ever, ever.
698000	701000	Like, for Dark Soccer, it's a lot of this fandom and all this stuff she kind of keeps
701000	702000	perpetuating.
702000	703000	For me, it's the multiplayer.
703000	706000	Like, I can keep going back and playing that and it's so much fun.
706000	708000	I've been playing a lot of multiplayer.
708000	709000	Yeah.
709000	713000	The bulk of my playing's been multiplayer because I, it's like my freebie pack, I got
713000	717000	the Geth, no, I got the Krogan Warlord in it.
717000	725000	And then I got, the first one that I actually got with my saved up points had the Turian
725000	726000	Cabal in it.
726000	727000	That was good.
727000	728000	The Lady Turian.
728000	733000	That was good of BioWare, by the way, to give everybody a free character new.
733000	737000	Like, you know, I think, I wish, like looking back, I wish I'd done that for each piece
737000	738000	of DLC they did.
738000	744000	Like, I understand their whole little micro transaction model is to make people save up
744000	749000	the in-game credits or be tempted to spend, you know, three bucks on a pack to maybe get
749000	750000	a character.
750000	753000	But I think it was a good, good gesture to give everybody a freebie.
753000	756000	Well, usually whenever DLC comes out that I have to pay for, I just go ahead and put
756000	763000	a 20 on it and then use my leftovers for multiplayer, which is what I'm going to do when I get Shenadel.
763000	769000	But, uh, I really, I never enjoyed playing a Vanguard until this one, because like the
769000	772000	moves are all like poison this and blades that.
772000	774000	It's like playing a Wolverturian.
774000	775000	Mm hmm.
775000	776000	I got Hawkeye.
776000	777000	Oh yeah.
777000	779000	The, um, I have, I have one of him too.
779000	780000	The Zaid wannabe.
780000	781000	Oh yeah.
781000	783000	But like with the, the bow and arrow, I, it's weird.
783000	784000	The omnibo.
784000	788000	I love engineers, but I wasn't like, it was cool for a little bit, but I'm not, I went
788000	791000	back to my human cause I don't have a Korean engineer on PC.
791000	796000	Well, I finally though, like this is the first time I've actually gotten a character up to
796000	797000	20 and promoted.
797000	798000	Nice.
798000	799000	My class.
799000	803000	So now I have to start over and I like, I hate the starting over cause like they put
803000	808000	us on a collector map right when I just started over and we all know the collectors are bullshit.
808000	809000	Yeah.
809000	810000	Yep.
810000	816000	So I, the second one thankfully was a, um, Cerberus thing, but it was, it was really
816000	817000	fun.
817000	823000	And the first game I was in though, I had to roll my eyes cause we had a collector adapt.
823000	827000	We had a juggernaut and we had a Krogan, a warlord.
827000	830000	So it was like almost all of the, all the misfits.
830000	831000	Yeah.
831000	832000	And it was such, I was amazed.
832000	835000	It was such a balanced party.
835000	837000	We just flew through everything.
837000	838000	Like it was no big deal.
838000	843000	It was, it was like a hot knife through butter.
843000	848000	Um, technus in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, um, he's kinda done with the mass effect
848000	849000	universe for now.
849000	850000	Good for you.
850000	851000	Do you?
851000	852000	Well, I mean, but, but I get it.
852000	854000	Like, is it, is it time?
854000	856000	You mean this is the last multiplayer DLC.
856000	858000	We have the last single player DLC next week.
858000	859000	Is it time?
859000	860000	I mean, nothing good lasts forever, right?
860000	863000	Is it time to move on to whatever's next for the Mass Effect series?
863000	864000	Three words.
864000	867000	Final Fantasy seven.
867000	868000	No.
868000	869000	Still going on.
869000	871000	Still going.
871000	872000	It took a while.
872000	875000	It took a while though to come back and then there was all the movies and everything.
875000	876000	All right.
876000	877000	Anything else you want to share?
877000	879000	Should I move on to Loki?
879000	881000	Um, that's really all I played.
881000	883000	I'm probably gonna be canceling a while.
883000	884000	Sad face.
884000	886000	Just for a little while until I get a job.
886000	887000	Makes sense.
887000	888000	All right.
888000	889000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
889000	891000	Um, my gaming week was all right.
891000	892000	It started off okay.
892000	893000	At least.
893000	897000	Um, I started, we were playing Borderlands two and kind of going through that stuff and
897000	904000	then that wonderful, um, add on content pack came out from, um, you know, 2k.
904000	906000	So, I was like, okay, cool.
906000	908000	I'm gonna go ahead and get this.
908000	912000	Yes, I know I could have saved some money by buying the DLC, either the season pass
912000	916000	or, um, you know, buying just the DLC straight from the marketplace.
916000	922000	Um, but here's the thing though is that I want to put it on more than one system because
922000	926000	I play with a friend and I don't want to buy the DLC twice and the add on content packs
926000	927000	do not have DRM on them.
927000	934000	They also apparently don't work very well because, um, the true nature of Gearbox is
934000	935000	finally coming out.
935000	937000	It's like, huh, you know, Borderlands is such an awesome game.
937000	942000	Why did they really fuck up Duke Nukem, you know, forever in Aliens Colonial Marines?
942000	945000	It's because it's a fluke because they fuck up everything.
945000	949000	Apparently, Borderlands is just, I guess, some weird fluke for this company.
949000	954000	Maybe they took some of that Duke Nukem money and Aliens Colonial Marines money and made
954000	955000	the game better or something.
955000	959000	I mean, but the disc does not, the disc broke the game.
959000	961000	Like, the disc broke the DLC.
961000	966000	Well, I, first off, couldn't get any of the DLC to work on either system.
966000	970000	Um, the people that did get it to work, they're having problems with the DLC not quite working
970000	973000	because they can't pick up any of the weapons that are exclusive to the game.
973000	978000	You get an error saying, this weapon is for this piece of DLC, which you don't have.
978000	982000	And, so that kind of sucks for everyone else.
982000	986000	Well, I mean, we could probably just remove the DLC and probably have to, I don't know,
986000	988000	clear a cache or something, re-download something.
988000	989000	I don't know.
989000	990000	But, it's still annoying though.
990000	993000	I don't want to have to go through this process and try to figure out, okay, which series
993000	995000	of events do I have to do to get this to work?
995000	1001000	Um, so anyways, so I was trying to get this thing to work and, uh,
1001000	1004000	Shadownextgen has an opinion on Gearbox.
1004000	1007000	Shadownextgen says, Gearbox cannot be blamed for Duke Nukem.
1007000	1011000	All they did was they put their existing material and made it playable.
1011000	1014000	Gearbox is totally to blame though for aliens.
1014000	1015000	Alright, that's fine.
1015000	1016000	Meeting you halfway.
1016000	1017000	That's fine.
1017000	1018000	I'll accept that.
1018000	1022000	But, the thing is, so, okay, so it's all fucked up in one way or another.
1022000	1025000	For me, it's a little bit more fucked up than some of the people that have the game
1025000	1030000	and just, they can't either access certain DLC or can't access the guns in certain DLC
1030000	1032000	or, you know, the waypoint's not showing up.
1032000	1036000	And their solution is, well, we're just gonna have to put out a patch for it.
1036000	1039000	The disc is for people that don't have fucking online.
1039000	1044000	How are you gonna download this patch to make the fucking offline thing work correctly?
1044000	1047000	Oh, that makes total sense.
1047000	1050000	It's like, fucking, did you guys test this at all?
1050000	1053000	Does that mean you have to do one of those weird things where you download it to a USB stick?
1053000	1055000	No, there is no way.
1055000	1057000	You can do that for system updates.
1057000	1063000	Like, the console firmware, you can't do that for game, I mean, you can't do that legitimately
1063000	1066000	with, you know, you can get tools to do that.
1066000	1070000	So you're telling me that the technology's there, it's just that for whatever reason
1070000	1072000	they don't let the publishers use it.
1072000	1076000	Yeah, it's basically you can download a system update that someone's dumped off their machine
1076000	1081000	off the internet and have, hopefully, a tool to be able to put it on a memory stick or something like that,
1081000	1085000	which is, it's out there, you can do that.
1085000	1088000	I guess it wouldn't be that hard if you used USB storage.
1088000	1090000	It used to be a lot harder, though.
1090000	1093000	So anyway, so that's all fucking broken, so that's great.
1094000	1099000	So for now, we've been playing emulator stuff, because I have these modded Xboxes
1099000	1105000	that we were messing around with, and so we've been playing Super Nintendo and Nintendo games and stuff.
1105000	1112000	I also started trying Far Cry 2, because my thought is, hey, I remember Far Cry Instinct's
1112000	1116000	Predator had a pretty awesome map editor, and you can make your own levels and stuff like that,
1116000	1118000	and the game's not that bad.
1118000	1122000	And then I was like, oh wait, Far Cry 2 even has a better emulator, or level editor,
1122000	1127000	and that might be kind of fun to play with, so I'm actually working with the Far Cry 2 level editor,
1127000	1129000	because I know I could do three.
1129000	1135000	I don't really know, three actually requires that you have, well, first of all, the game's pretty expensive.
1135000	1137000	It's under 20 bucks now.
1139000	1143000	So I would have probably picked three first, but two seems to be pretty good, price point wise.
1143000	1149000	So I'm recreating my favorite maps from other games in the Far Cry map editor.
1149000	1157000	So I've got, I've started from Grand Theft Auto 4, Valet of Gay Tony,
1157000	1163000	I've got the Ziggurat map, which is the ferry terminal that's under construction.
1163000	1165000	So I've started that, and it looks pretty awesome.
1165000	1170000	So hopefully I'm going to just take all my favorite levels, or I'll just download some if I'm too damn lazy,
1170000	1176000	because it is quite a process to get that stuff looking right, and actually getting it to work correctly.
1177000	1182000	So I may just download some other maps and stuff like that, and hopefully maybe we can switch over that,
1182000	1188000	because I think right now we bought another map pack for Call of Duty a couple weeks ago,
1188000	1190000	and we're kind of already sick of them.
1190000	1194000	It's like, you know, we don't want to keep purchasing $15 map packs
1194000	1198000	if we're just going to get sick of these maps in a couple weeks.
1198000	1202000	It's just, we need something to kill the time between now and Grand Theft Auto 5.
1202000	1208000	Which, by the way, my fucking asshole boss, who didn't fucking take me to Destination PlayStation,
1208000	1213000	Dick's like, hey, I got the Z-Grand Theft Auto 5 being played, twice,
1213000	1218000	because the guy died midway through one of the missions, so I got to see it all over again.
1218000	1220000	I'm like, I fucking hate you.
1220000	1222000	But anyways, it sounds really awesome, though.
1222000	1225000	They were just talking about how you can switch between the three characters during the game.
1225000	1230000	They showed off one of the levels that, I don't think it was in the trailer, I think it was a screenshot.
1230000	1233000	It was basically where the guy's repelling down the side of an office building.
1233000	1237000	And so he's like, oh yeah, so one of the guys you're controlling is flying the helicopter,
1237000	1240000	and the other one's like a sharpshooter on one of the other buildings,
1240000	1242000	and then the other guy's the one that's repelling.
1242000	1244000	And actually, as you're repelling the detail in the game,
1244000	1247000	you have people coming in the offices and going up to one of them,
1247000	1249000	hey, what's going on, you know, what is that?
1249000	1251000	So it's just, I don't know, it sounds really awesome.
1251000	1254000	And of course, he reiterated the size of the game and stuff,
1254000	1258000	and he just says it looks fucking amazing, so I can't wait.
1259000	1262000	So fuck the next gen, I don't care, I just want this game.
1262000	1263000	That's right.
1264000	1267000	But what about those games analysts that say, oh for sure,
1267000	1270000	Grand Theft Auto 5 will come to next gen consoles?
1270000	1274000	Yeah, here's what he said, it'll come to next gen consoles eventually.
1274000	1278000	And the only way I believe that is if they do a PC port, which they're not doing right away.
1278000	1283000	They may do one later on, or they may go the Red Dead Redemption route and say fuck it, we're not gonna do one.
1283000	1285000	Especially if they're worried that the game's gonna get hacked,
1285000	1288000	because that's where you get your fucking keys for,
1288000	1292000	well, they're stupid enough anyways to put the fucking keys for Grand Theft Auto
1292000	1294000	and have it be all the same across platforms,
1294000	1296000	which is, I don't know why they do that.
1298000	1300000	So let's assume that they don't do that,
1300000	1302000	and when they do put out a PC port, it would enable hacking,
1302000	1305000	or at least that's how it's been.
1305000	1308000	So I think that yeah, they could do a PC port,
1308000	1310000	and if they do that, then they'll probably do a next gen port,
1310000	1312000	because they're gonna be uprising everything,
1312000	1316000	or making it run better, have better particle effects and that kind of stuff.
1316000	1320000	But it's not gonna be at launch, and it would be like eventually,
1320000	1324000	like maybe next year or a year after that,
1324000	1329000	depending on what their release schedule is as far as what Rockstar are gonna be working on next.
1329000	1334000	Probably DLC for Grand Theft Auto V, which would be pretty awesome.
1334000	1337000	So I don't know, they're gonna be busy for a while,
1337000	1340000	so I don't think they can really split the resources.
1340000	1343000	I am kind of surprised that it's not in the Wii U,
1343000	1346000	but I don't know, whatever.
1347000	1350000	Alright, let's see.
1351000	1354000	Shadow next gen in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
1354000	1357000	He wouldn't take Loki and then was bragging about getting to see Grand Theft Auto V.
1357000	1358000	That ain't right.
1358000	1361000	Well, it's just, you know, they took our buyer and stuff,
1361000	1366000	and you know, our, well he was the vice president of sales now,
1366000	1368000	he's some new business guy.
1368000	1371000	So it's just all the management people and the buyer.
1371000	1374000	Don't worry, I'm working on getting rid of the buyer.
1374000	1376000	Soon enough, I'll be going.
1376000	1377000	It'll just be a matter of time.
1377000	1381000	But I did say, I'm like, so, you're taking me along with, you know,
1381000	1383000	DPS, because they're gonna have Grand Theft Auto there.
1383000	1386000	I mean, we don't need to send this VP guy, he doesn't know anything about games.
1388000	1390000	Alright, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
1391000	1393000	Minecraft, played a little bit more Minecraft.
1393000	1395000	Yeah, how's the server going?
1395000	1397000	It's empty there.
1397000	1398000	I played some last week.
1398000	1399000	Okay.
1399000	1400000	It's very empty.
1400000	1402000	I hardly see a soul on there.
1402000	1405000	I do check the logs every now and then to see if people are actually connecting.
1405000	1409000	I would like to thank whoever built the ginormous N7 in front of my house.
1409000	1410000	Oh, that wasn't you?
1410000	1412000	No, it wasn't me.
1413000	1415000	I do keep an eye on it every now and then.
1415000	1420000	I read the forums, and I also check my 3D map every once in a while
1420000	1422000	to see if something new is on the way.
1422000	1424000	Hey, that's different.
1424000	1428000	Now, I was working on... I don't even know what it is now.
1428000	1432000	I was trying to create this little airship thing that I have a picture of,
1432000	1435000	and not necessarily create it exactly, but just something similar.
1435000	1439000	And then I was like, okay, I'm gonna make this giant castle inside this mountain.
1439000	1442000	And then I was like, I'm wasting so much damn time in Minecraft.
1442000	1444000	I could be doing something more productive,
1444000	1447000	but I just didn't want to be productive that day.
1448000	1450000	We need to build Hogwarts.
1450000	1452000	Oh, I remember what it was now, why I was playing Minecraft.
1452000	1456000	Because my wife was watching Hulu, which is being streamed through my Xbox,
1456000	1458000	and I wanted to build maps in Far Cry.
1458000	1462000	And so I was waiting for Far Cry to download or something like that,
1462000	1464000	because I bought it on PC as well.
1464000	1468000	So, you know, instead of buying stuff on the sale on Xbox,
1468000	1470000	I bought PC games.
1470000	1472000	SSJ100Matt says, I'll be getting Minecraft soon.
1472000	1474000	You know, I saw at Target, those little...
1474000	1478000	It's mixed in with all the cards for the crap online stuff you're never gonna play,
1478000	1480000	like Club Penguin and all those...
1480000	1482000	You know how they sell tons of those cards?
1482000	1484000	There was a card for Minecraft.
1484000	1486000	So you can buy Minecraft at Target and stuff now.
1486000	1491000	I am eventually, at some point, once I get motivated enough to finish the website and stuff,
1491000	1494000	to setting up nights to do things.
1494000	1496000	So I haven't quite done that yet.
1496000	1501000	I know Code Man's going in there, and he's doing videos of some of the Mob Arena stuff,
1501000	1506000	which that needs to be fixed and balanced.
1506000	1508000	He's good at all that fancy YouTube stuff.
1508000	1511000	He's helping do a trailer for the server, so I don't know what he's up to.
1511000	1513000	Yeah, the cricket sounds and no one there.
1513000	1515000	That'd be awesome.
1515000	1516000	It's empty!
1516000	1519000	I almost thought about making it not whitelisted,
1519000	1520000	but it's still...
1520000	1521000	All you get is griefers, then.
1521000	1522000	Yeah, you know, no.
1522000	1523000	Whitelist is a good idea.
1523000	1524000	You should keep it that way.
1524000	1525000	You really should.
1525000	1527000	I've actually just been having fun digging my holes,
1527000	1529000	which is pretty much all my houses are.
1529000	1530000	They're holes in the ground.
1530000	1531000	Like you do on the show.
1531000	1533000	Just dig your own holes all night.
1533000	1535000	You've seen my house, haven't you?
1535000	1537000	My prairie doggy?
1537000	1538000	Minecraft house? No, I haven't.
1538000	1539000	Minecraft house.
1539000	1541000	It's a series of underground tunnels.
1541000	1543000	I haven't been on Minecraft in like a month.
1543000	1544000	Shame on me.
1544000	1545000	I get yelled at all the time.
1545000	1547000	Yelled at over it.
1547000	1548000	All right.
1548000	1550000	I know, I keep looking at your half-finished house all the time.
1550000	1551000	I know, I need to finish it.
1551000	1553000	All right, anything else you want to share for your gaming week?
1553000	1554000	That's it.
1554000	1555000	Wait until you hear what I have been playing.
1555000	1556000	You're gonna be like, God damn it, Rob.
1556000	1557000	All right, so my gaming week.
1557000	1560000	Well, I was driving around town hoping somebody broke street on Tomb Raider
1560000	1563000	because I heard a lot of places were selling Tomb Raider early,
1563000	1565000	but I couldn't find any,
1565000	1567000	so I guess I'll have to wait like everybody else.
1567000	1568000	Boo.
1568000	1572000	But how can you not want Tomb Raider after the Conan review?
1574000	1575000	Although...
1575000	1578000	The Conan, I love his video, the review thing,
1578000	1580000	it's kind of hit and miss and stuff,
1580000	1585000	but my God are the deaths in that so violent and frequent.
1585000	1589000	It's kind of, I think Jamie would like the game actually for that reason.
1589000	1590000	What game?
1590000	1591000	Tomb Raider.
1591000	1592000	Oh, the new one?
1592000	1594000	Yes, because there's stuff, you know,
1594000	1595000	okay, you got to go left.
1595000	1596000	Oh, you got to go right.
1596000	1598000	Oh, you didn't go right fast enough.
1598000	1602000	And now she impales her neck on a stick very violently.
1602000	1604000	That sounds awesome.
1604000	1605000	Yeah, I wasn't...
1605000	1607000	One of our listeners got me the last one, the Guardian of Light.
1607000	1608000	Oh, yeah?
1608000	1609000	So thank you.
1609000	1610000	I wasn't...
1610000	1611000	Well, Guardian of Light is so different.
1611000	1612000	I love Guardian of Light though.
1612000	1613000	That was a great game.
1613000	1615000	But yeah, I wasn't really prepared.
1615000	1617000	I mean, I should have known better because like, you know,
1617000	1620000	I know Tomb Raider, it was all about the death scenes back in the day,
1620000	1622000	but it was a little more cartoony back then.
1622000	1624000	Locking the butler in the fridge.
1624000	1627000	Some of that stuff now, like when I saw that whole impale scene,
1627000	1630000	I was like, oh, maybe, maybe I don't know.
1630000	1633000	Maybe I'm having second thoughts about this purchase because, you know,
1633000	1636000	I'm not huge on the violence, but I'll deal with it.
1636000	1638000	From what I hear, it's limited.
1638000	1641000	I wonder if you can still make her break her own neck.
1641000	1642000	Oh, yeah.
1642000	1643000	Oh, I'm sure you can.
1643000	1644000	It wouldn't be Tomb Raider if you couldn't.
1644000	1645000	Because that's fun.
1645000	1647000	And I still want to lock the butler in the freezer.
1647000	1648000	Maybe.
1648000	1649000	Because that was the only thing I ever did in two.
1649000	1650000	Maybe you can.
1650000	1652000	It wouldn't surprise me if they have throwbacks to.
1652000	1654000	Well, then again, her mansion's not really in this one.
1654000	1655000	This is a reboot.
1655000	1656000	It's a prequel.
1656000	1658000	She doesn't have a butler yet.
1658000	1659000	You'll have to hope for a new one.
1659000	1662000	Maybe at the end of the game when she gets to her mansion or something
1662000	1663000	like that, she's like.
1663000	1665000	She gets a letter from her butler.
1665000	1667000	Dear ma'am, I'm still in the freezer.
1667000	1668000	Please let me out.
1668000	1671000	Sincerely, your butler.
1671000	1672000	Oh, God.
1672000	1675000	S2-100 Matt in chat says, Rob, just get it and have your mom play it.
1676000	1680000	It could top the Conan's review things, though.
1680000	1681000	Having my mother do it.
1681000	1682000	Because my mom is.
1682000	1683000	Kids react to Tomb Raider.
1683000	1684000	Oh, my God, Rob.
1684000	1685000	What's this game?
1685000	1686000	Rob.
1686000	1687000	Oh, Rob, that is gross.
1687000	1690000	People, you paid $60 for this, Rob.
1690000	1692000	You should be trying to rape her.
1692000	1694000	You should be saving your money, Rob.
1694000	1696000	Get a 401k.
1696000	1699000	SSG-100 Matt does the best.
1699000	1701000	You should reread that in your mom's voice.
1701000	1703000	Rob, that's gross, Rob.
1703000	1704000	Through her neck.
1704000	1705000	Come on, Rob.
1705000	1706000	I would totally be here.
1706000	1707000	All right.
1707000	1708000	So let's talk about what.
1708000	1709000	I adore your mom.
1709000	1710000	Oh, no.
1710000	1711000	Who doesn't?
1711000	1713000	Let's talk about what I have been playing.
1713000	1715000	I have been playing.
1715000	1719000	OK, here's your LOL WTF BBQ moment.
1719000	1723000	Like, all weekend, I've been playing Diablo 3.
1723000	1724000	What?
1724000	1725000	Right?
1725000	1727000	Like, what am I smoking?
1727000	1728000	I don't know.
1728000	1732000	I think the fact that I've been, like, into Path of Exile lately, like, made me go like,
1732000	1736000	maybe I should go back and try Diablo 3 because I was enjoying Path of Exile.
1736000	1740000	And, you know, people say Diablo 3 is extra for was like, you need to go back because
1740000	1743000	a lot of it's, you know, patches and all this.
1743000	1744000	And I've actually been enjoying it.
1744000	1748000	I've got to admit, I think part of that is the fact that nobody else is playing Diablo
1748000	1749000	3 right now.
1749000	1752000	So, well, I have to get people jumping in on your game.
1752000	1753000	Well, yeah, exactly.
1753000	1758000	Actually, yes, I have one or two people that play on my friends list, but they're all like
1758000	1760000	super high paragon level and all that stuff.
1760000	1761000	You know, they play a lot more than I do.
1761000	1764000	So, I'm actually kind of getting to take the game at my own pace.
1764000	1771000	And, yeah, just on the off chance that somebody on my friends list is, like, you know, a total
1771000	1775000	noob and getting an itch to play Diablo 3 like me, I actually turned it off where people
1775000	1777000	can't join my game anymore.
1777000	1781000	And I said, you know what, I'm going to play this through one time, just me at my own pace
1781000	1785000	because I think part of what broke the game for me was that having people jump in your
1785000	1790000	game, as much as it's nice to be social and all that, like, it paces the game a lot differently
1790000	1793000	because people will be off kind of doing their own thing.
1793000	1796000	You got to go back to town and sell stuff, but you don't want to miss some of the exploration
1796000	1799000	and the XP and, you know, I don't know.
1799000	1803000	Like, so I kind of want to just, I want to play this game by myself for a little bit
1803000	1804000	one time.
1804000	1805000	But always connected to the internet.
1805000	1809000	Yes, but it's always connected to the internet, which is ridiculous in its own right.
1809000	1815000	But, hey, at least I got the game complimentary with the whole Warcraft pass thing.
1815000	1816000	So, I can't complain too much about that.
1816000	1818000	I may have to reinstall it and give it another go.
1818000	1820000	I didn't dislike it.
1820000	1824000	I just didn't like not being able to rotate the camera and getting a better view.
1824000	1828000	So, that was really my biggest, that and people jumping in my game, which I had turned it
1828000	1830000	off and people were still jumping in my game.
