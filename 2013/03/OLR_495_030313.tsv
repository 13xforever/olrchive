8767	25408	Sakura, Sky, and Loku Tonight, March 3rd, 2013 Two companies promise new games at PAX East Gran Turismo 6 will be out before year's end And could Shenmue 3 happen via Kickstarter?
31789	32089	DarkSakura
54332	55053	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
76926	78227	Who claims it has not worked.
78247	78947	Nah, it has not worked.
78967	79828	It has not worked.
81989	86712	Well, you've been... How long have you and Nellie been together since the start of OLR, right?
86832	87752	You guys were together.
87992	88953	Yeah, around there.
88993	89513	Wow, so... I think 2001.
89794	91975	And you and Dan have been together that long, too.
92275	94176	Well, we've been together for 15 years.
94596	95177	Oh, my gosh.
95497	97078	As of the 23rd of January.
97803	101787	This show just, you know, fosters long-term relationships.
101847	108492	Meanwhile, over the course of the show, I think I've had four or five different... I did get married after we started the show.
109533	112175	But the one I'm on is the last one, because he's listening.
112776	115478	So you know he's a keeper, because he's supportive and all that stuff.
115998	116298	Right?
117139	125526	Yes, and he's officially my hero for re-reblogging one of my posts on my Mass Effect blog, because I totally agree with him.
126398	129000	Oh, you guys and your Mass Effect lulzy stuff.
129040	129820	Hey, you know what?
131001	132822	You were talking about Shitadel earlier.
135904	138445	Are we already dogging the DLC before anybody's played it?
138725	140627	That's just my special nickname for the Citadel.
140747	141207	Oh, okay.
141507	142067	The Shitadel?
142127	142928	That's very clever.
142968	143828	That's very creative.
143908	145529	Yeah, Becky and I call it that sometimes.
145549	146170	Funny you.
147030	148412	Bobby Blackwolf Ken Allen
169031	171074	I have a confession, Rob I really didn't play many of them
184150	185351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
201420	206265	and I did like Phantasmagoria, but I played the LucasArts games.
207085	207706	I played Loom.
207786	209628	Okay, well that was all kind of around that same time.
209668	214252	Yeah, it was around that same time, but I just wasn't as into it myself.
214392	215053	Oh God, I loved it.
215073	215874	I was a console girl.
216834	222939	I will admit, I was not as into Space Quest as I was into Heroes Quest, and especially King's Quest.
223299	225721	That series was so amazing to me.
225821	231145	I think everybody remembers King's Quest IV, Rosella, because that's the one that incorporates all the old fairy tales and stuff.
231666	233627	Oh my gosh, great, great classic game.
233647	234668	I just didn't get into them.
234708	241553	I think the only real thing I played on a PC before that were the text-based gemstones.
242540	245723	And then of course your favorite, Civilization, the old school one.
245804	247405	I got into that early on.
247846	248807	I was never into Civ.
249347	251129	Which I should give a plug for this.
251189	252571	I'm curious what you guys think about this.
253171	258537	You know, Microsoft is doing a huge sale on their games on demand right now where you can get a lot of these...
259758	260339	Thanks for watching!
274551	275552	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
296703	301047	If I was going to try and get Jamie into Civ, I would be all like, poke, poke, here's a $10 gift card.
301087	302369	Poke, poke, here's what you go spend it on.
302409	302829	Poke, poke.
303249	304811	But I know that won't work, so I'm not even going to bother.
305612	306532	I'm not giving her money.
308735	311217	If you gave me money right now, I'd probably just pay bills with it.
312558	319965	What do you guys think about Microsoft responding to this really deep cut sale thing of sorts?
320683	327726	Well, I think they're just trying to push digital sales, trying to figure out, you know, how to get people interested in that stuff.
328526	331387	And it's all about getting them more exposure.
332208	346193	Maybe, you know, kind of trying to, I don't know, hype up stuff and, you know, as we approach a supposed announcement of some sort, you know, so maybe...
348166	351910	I don't know, it seems to have worked for Steam and stuff to help drive sales.
351930	356895	Maybe that's why they want to... Hey guys, you know we do sell games digitally as well, right?
357415	359497	It's not just Sony and Steam.
360078	360959	We do that as well.
361039	363461	So, hey, buy something.
364642	367705	A tiny correction to what I had stated earlier.
367805	371568	Bobby says it was Space Quest 4 was the one in the series that Ken Allen did.
371628	371848	Not 2.
372769	373550	Oops, my bad.
374310	381596	But I will say that I know this one for a fact because Bobby and I are both fond over this one and our mutual love of an old-ass Sierra game I bet none of you have heard of.
381616	382957	It's called Jones in the Fast Lane.
383698	384659	Thank you for watching!
401502	402263	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
427290	429272	I want to know something, Rob.
429512	429752	What?
430072	434676	Why people on Tumblr think that I want to see animated gifs of Caden's butt.
435797	438039	Because you're following those Tumblrs.
438259	440801	It's all about what you want to follow on the Tumbles.
441241	443143	Wasn't there one called Caden's ass?
443543	444864	This one's called Shepard's butt.
445645	449688	It's because it's like, hey, we saw that you viewed alien penises.
450208	451429	You may like Caden's butt.
452850	454752	There's also one that's called Shepard's left boob.
456181	456941	I have no idea.
483655	487138	All right, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
487198	489179	Black Wolf, yet again trying to correct me here.
489559	494083	The only difference between the disc and CD version was the CD version had full spoken audio.
494383	495984	The animated characters were still there.
496364	500047	I thought in the CD version, they were actual like digitized characters.
500107	501988	And in the disc one, they were cartoons.
502269	505431	And on the disc version, there is a fuck yes, I boob tumbler.
505891	508773	And on the disc version, it came on like 48 discs, right?
508833	511255	Because, you know, that's the equivalent of a CD.
511275	514076	The disc version of Jones, I think, was only like four.
514197	515457	Like four discs or so.
515918	517219	No, I remember, what was it?
517299	518639	Willy Beamish, I think it was.
518700	520981	It was a game I was playing way back in the day.
521001	521762	I remember that game.
522002	523803	It was on like 12 discs.
523823	527145	Yeah, I had an anime fighting game.
527385	527966	It was called...
529838	530599	I don't remember what it was called.
530619	531259	Something lace.
531439	532420	I don't remember what it was called now.
532440	535463	It was like metal and lace or something like that.
535864	540127	I got into like software, et cetera, you know, back in the day.
541329	546694	Never did get that game to run correctly, but damn, it took a long time with like eight plus disks installing.
546934	551618	That was the whole reason you needed a hard drive was because you had to have something to install the stinking disks to.
552659	554240	No, the 14 disk descent.
555040	556321	Oh yeah, yeah.
556682	559604	That's where you had to have like a rubber band to bind all the discs together.
560285	560685	Good times.
560745	561886	I still have it somewhere.
562667	563808	My stack of Descent discs.
564946	565866	Classic Gaming.
565906	566327	What a trip.
566367	571108	Alright, let's get into what we've been playing this week as far as modern games go.
571208	572849	Not that classics are bad by any means.
572869	575590	I mean, I've been playing Capcom Arcade a lot lately.
576210	578571	Why don't we just start with Rob?
578731	581612	Well, no, I was going to say... No, that was last week, not this week.
581632	584393	But I was going to say, you missed last week, and I was talking about Capcom Arcade.
584433	591196	Did you know that the freebie game that you can just get for free on PlayStation 3 is Black Tiger, which you've talked about on the show before?
591216	591296	Yeah.
591938	594168	and you can flip between the Japanese and the English versions.
594188	596096	I was so excited to tell you last week and then you weren't here.
597332	599694	I think Dan might have already gotten it.
599794	600254	I don't know.
600414	600815	It's cool.
601155	602296	Yeah, it's a neat game.
603036	604137	It's one of Dan's favorites.
604217	605919	Next week they're putting out Gun.Smoke.
606499	607060	Gun.Smoke.
607180	607720	Gun.Smoke.
608121	608581	Yeah.
608881	610102	I have a demo for Gun.Smoke.
610563	611123	It's good times.
611523	612804	All right, we'll start with you.
613245	613925	What were you going to say?
613945	614946	Something sassy over there, Loki?
614966	622432	I wonder, you know, because now that they're allowing you to get all these weird URL names, I wonder if someday we will have Gun.Smoke.
623053	623293	Yeah.
624033	625674	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
650757	654140	Mass Effect, The Reckoning DLC, The Last Multiplayer DLC, The
672159	673960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
689965	691587	But the multiplayer is so good.
691627	693709	The multiplayer is fantastic.
693909	697453	You guys wonder why we don't shut up about Mass Effect 3 ever, ever.
698173	701717	For DarkSakura, it's a lot of this fandom and all this stuff she keeps perpetuating.
701737	702758	For me, it's the multiplayer.
702918	706181	I can keep going back and playing that and it's so much fun.
706481	707683	I've been playing a lot of multiplayer.
708343	709785	The bulk of my playing has been multiplayer because I...
710445	713327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
728317	734823	That was good of Bioware, by the way, to give everybody a free character new.
735384	737846	Looking back, I wish they'd done that for each piece of DLC they did.
738327	749398	I understand their whole little microtransaction model is to make people save up the in-game credits or be tempted to spend three bucks on a pack to maybe get a character.
749798	752841	But I think it was a good gesture to give everybody a freebie.
753001	753381	I got Hawkeye.
776986	779610	Oh yeah, I have one of him too, the Zayid wannabe.
779951	782395	Oh yeah, but like with the bow and arrow, it's weird.
782996	783737	The omni-bow.
784017	790467	I love engineers, but I wasn't, like it was cool for a little bit, but I went back to my human because I don't have a quarian engineer on PC.
791072	798458	Well, I finally, though, like, this is the first time I've actually gotten a character up to 20 and promoted my class.
799319	808307	So now I have to start over, and I, like, I hate the starting over, because, like, they put us on a collector map right when I just started over, and we all know the collectors are bullshit.
808367	808867	Yeah, yeah.
809448	814733	So, the second one, thankfully, was a Cerberus thing, but...
815753	816894	It was really fun.
818254	827418	The first game I was in, though, I had to roll my eyes because we had a Collector Adept, we had a Gath Juggernaut, and we had a Krogan Warlord.
827458	829899	So it was almost all of the new classes.
830919	832800	And I was amazed.
832840	834781	It was such a balanced party.
835621	838322	We just flew through everything like it was no big deal.
838442	841944	It was like a hot knife through butter.
841964	842824	Yeah.
843728	849370	Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says he's kind of done with the Mass Effect universe for now.
849750	850250	Good for you.
850970	852531	Well, I mean, but I get it.
852591	853851	Like, is it time?
853871	856332	I mean, this is the last multiplayer DLC.
856352	858033	We have the last single player DLC next week.
858353	858873	Is it time?
859073	860553	I mean, nothing good lasts forever, right?
860694	863274	Is it time to move on to whatever's next for the Mass Effect series?
863294	863754	Three words.
864415	865135	Final Fantasy VII.
867472	867652	No.
867912	868852	Still going on.
869052	869633	Still going.
871293	872013	It took a while.
872133	873334	It took a while, though, to come back.
873814	875074	And there was all the movies and everything.
875534	875854	All right.
875974	877695	Anything else you want to share or should I move on to Loki?
879715	880616	That's really all I played.
880856	881996	I'm probably going to be canceling a while.
882756	883336	Sad face.
883916	885077	Just for a little while until I get a job.
885677	886057	Makes sense.
886897	887237	All right.
887337	888458	Loki, how was your gaming week?
889278	890918	My gaming week was all right.
891078	892459	It started off okay, at least.
893559	896960	I started, we were playing Borderlands 2 and kind of going through that stuff.
896980	904183	And then that wonderful add-on content pack came out from 2K.
904443	905784	So I was like, okay, cool.
905884	907545	I'm going to go ahead and get this.
907605	916088	Yes, I know I could have saved some money by buying the DLC, either the season pass or buying just the DLC straight from the marketplace.
917028	921370	But here's the thing, though, is that I want to put it on more than one system.
921790	924371	Because I play with a friend, and I don't want to play DLC twice.
924711	927092	And the add-on content packs do not have DRM on them.
927793	929453	They also apparently don't work very well.
929533	934936	Because the true nature of Gearbox is finally coming out.
934996	935556	It's like, huh...
936076	937477	Borderlands is such an awesome game.
937537	941678	Why did they really fuck up Duke Nukem Forever and Aliens Colonial Marines?
941998	943178	It's because it's a fluke.
943218	946079	Because they fuck up everything, apparently.
946339	949500	Borderlands is just, I guess, some weird fluke for this company.
949540	955042	Maybe they took some of that Duke Nukem money and Aliens Colonial Marines money and made the game better or something.
955462	958943	But the disc broke the game.
959303	962104	The disc broke the DLC.
962324	965305	First off, I couldn't get any of the DLC to work on either system.
966505	972408	The people that did get it to work, they're having problems with the DLC not quite working because they can't pick up any of the weapons that are exclusive to the game.
973088	977230	You get in there saying, this weapon is for this piece of DLC which you don't have.
980163	982264	So that kind of sucks for everyone else.
982644	988686	Well, I mean, we could probably just remove the DLC and probably have to, I don't know, clear our cache or something, re-download something, I don't know.
989266	990246	But it's still annoying, though.
990266	994928	I don't want to have to go through this process and try to figure out, okay, which series of events do I have to do to get this to work?
997149	999710	So anyways, so I was trying to get this thing to work, and...
1001897	1004338	Shadow Next Gen has an opinion on Gearbox.
1004478	1007239	Shadow Next Gen says, Gearbox cannot be blamed for Duke Nukem.
1007660	1010761	All they did was they put their existing material and made it playable.
1011101	1013062	Gearbox is totally to blame, though, for aliens.
1014142	1014703	All right, that's fine.
1015083	1015823	Meeting you halfway.
1016743	1017124	That's fine.
1017144	1017664	I'll accept that.
1018124	1047244	but the thing is so okay so it's all fucked up in one way or another and for me it's a little bit more fucked up than some of the people that have the game and just like can't either access certain DLC or can't access the guns in certain DLC or you know the waypoint's not showing up and their solution is well we're just gonna have to put out a patch for it the disc is for people that don't have fucking online how are you gonna download this patch to make the fucking offline thing work correctly oh that makes total sense
1048695	1050016	Did you guys test this at all?
1050096	1053599	Does that mean you have to do one of those weird things where you download it to a USB stick?
1053919	1055100	No, there is no way.
1055120	1057101	You can do that for system updates.
1057462	1059943	The console firmware, you can't do that for game updates.
1060644	1063366	You can't do that legitimately.
1064306	1066528	You can get tools to do that.
1066628	1072232	You're telling me that the technology's there, it's just that for whatever reason they don't let the publishers use it.
1072432	1073193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1094171	1104420	So for now we've been playing like emulator stuff because I have these modded Xboxes that we were messing around with and so we've been playing like Super Nintendo and Nintendo games and stuff.
1106021	1117371	I also started trying Far Cry 2 because my thought is, hey, you know, I remember Far Cry Instinct's Predator had a pretty awesome map editor and you can make your own levels and stuff like that and the game's not that bad.
1117931	1118951	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1139557	1142978	So I would have probably picked three first, but two seems to be pretty good price point-wise.
1143458	1149240	So I'm recreating my favorite maps from other games in the Far Cry map editor.
1149700	1156922	So I've got, I've started from Grand Theft Auto IV, Bellative, Gay Tony.
1157142	1163204	I've got the Ziggurat map, which is the ferry terminal that's under construction.
1163324	1165025	So I've started that, and it looks pretty awesome.
1165605	1176309	So hopefully I'm going to just take all my favorite levels or I'll just download some if I'm too damn lazy because it is quite a process to get that stuff looking right and actually getting it to work correctly.
1178370	1190034	So I may just download some other maps and stuff like that and hopefully maybe we can switch over that because I think right now we bought another map pack for Call of Duty a couple weeks ago and we're kind of already sick of them.
1190254	1190494	It's like...
1191434	1192094	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1209045	1215634	Dicks like, hey, I got to see Grand Theft Auto V being played twice because the guy died midway through one of the missions.
1215734	1217917	So I got to see it all over again.
1217957	1219919	I'm like, I fucking hate you.
1220520	1221822	But anyways, it sounds really awesome though.
1221842	1224666	They're just talking about how you can switch between the three characters during the game.
1225606	1228788	They showed off one of the levels that... I don't think it was in the trailer.
1228828	1230189	I think it was a screenshot.
1230369	1233550	It was basically where the guy's rappelling down the side of an office building.
1233991	1240254	And so he's like, oh yeah, so one of the guys you're controlling is flying a helicopter and another one's a sharpshooter on one of the other buildings.
1240654	1242075	And then the other guy's the one that's rappelling.
1242415	1247778	And actually as you're rappelling, the detail in the game, you have people coming in the offices and going, hey, what's going on?
1248318	1248738	What is that?
1249219	1249719	So it's just...
1250259	1270053	I don't know, it sounds really awesome and of course he reiterated the size of the game and stuff and he just says it looks fucking amazing so I can't wait so fuck the next gen, I don't care, I just want this game that's right but what about those games analysts that say oh for sure Grand Theft Auto 5 will come to next gen consoles
1270894	1272115	Yeah, here's what he said.
1272396	1274217	It'll come to next-gen consoles eventually.
1274498	1278501	And the only way I believe that is if they do a PC port, which they're not doing right away.
1278582	1282906	They may do one later on, or they may go the Red Dead Redemption route and say, fuck it, we're not going to do one.
1283246	1294017	Especially if they're worried that the game's going to get hacked, because that's where you get your fucking keys for... Well, they're stupid enough anyways to put the fucking keys for Grand Theft Auto and have it be all the same across platforms.
1294998	1295979	I don't know why they do that.
1298181	1299843	So let's assume that they don't do that.
1300083	1302385	And when they do put out a PC port, it would enable hacking.
1302425	1304928	Or at least that's how it's been.
1305408	1308712	So I think that, yeah, they could do a PC port.
1308732	1315719	And if they do that, then they'll probably do a next-gen port because they're going to be up-resing everything or making it run better, have better particle effects and that kind of stuff.
1316480	1345571	but it's not going to be at launch and it would be like eventually like maybe next year or a year after that depending on what their release schedule is as far as what Rockstar is going to be working on next probably DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5 which would be pretty awesome so I don't know they're going to be busy for a while so I don't think they can really split the resources I am kind of surprised that it's not on the Wii U but I don't know whatever
1347245	1373234	Alright, let's see ShadowNextGen in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com He wouldn't take Loki and then was bragging about getting to see Grand Theft Auto 5 That ain't right Well, it's just, you know, they took our buyer and stuff and, you know, our Well, he was the vice president of sales, now he's some new business guy So it's just all the management people and the buyer Don't worry, I'm working on getting rid of the buyer
1374801	1375823	Soon enough, I'll be going.
1376324	1377366	It'll just be a matter of time.
1377386	1382957	But I did say, I'm like, so, you're taking me along with, you know, DPS, because they're going to have Grand Theft Auto there.
1383178	1384921	I mean, we don't need to send this VP guy.
1384961	1385843	He doesn't know anything about games.
1388154	1389795	Alright, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
1391056	1391476	Minecraft.
1391636	1392756	Played a little bit more Minecraft.
1392796	1393017	Yeah?
1393057	1393797	How's the server going?
1394978	1396538	It's empty.
1397219	1398299	I played some last week.
1399340	1400060	It's very empty.
1400480	1402061	I hardly see a soul on there.
1402401	1405083	I do check the logs every now and then to see if people are actually connecting.
1405643	1409165	I would like to thank whoever built the ginormous N7 in front of my house.
1409525	1410285	Oh, that wasn't you?
1410746	1412006	No, it wasn't me!
1413607	1415808	I do keep an eye on it every now and then.
1415868	1421890	I read the forums and I also check my 3D map every once in a while to see if something is new.
1421930	1424270	I'm like, hey, that's different.
1424690	1428672	No, I was working on... I don't even know what it is now.
1428712	1432633	I was trying to create this little airship thing that I have a picture of.
1433033	1435794	Not necessarily create it exactly, but just something similar.
1436274	1439095	And then I was like, okay, I'm going to make this giant castle inside this mountain.
1439375	1442317	And I was like, I'm wasting so much damn time in Minecraft.
1442377	1447541	I could be doing something more productive, but I just didn't want to be productive that day.
1448562	1449583	We need to build Hogwarts.
1450463	1452805	Oh, I remember what it was now, why I was playing Minecraft.
1452825	1458169	Because my wife was watching Hulu, which is being streamed through my Xbox, and I wanted to build maps in Far Cry.
1458589	1462492	And so I was waiting for Far Cry to download or something like that.
1462972	1464894	Because I bought it on PC as well, so...
1466601	1469803	instead of buying stuff on the sale on Xbox I bought PC games.
1470443	1472584	SSJ100 Matt says I'll be getting Minecraft soon.
1472904	1481927	You know I saw at Target those little like it's mixed in with all the cards for the crap online stuff you're never going to play like Club Penguin and all those you know how like they sell tons of those cards.
1482287	1483508	There was a card for Minecraft.
1483668	1483828	Yeah.
1483968	1486509	So like you can buy Minecraft at like Target and stuff now.
1487149	1491231	I am eventually at some point once I get motivated enough to finish the website and stuff to
1491611	1493734	Settling up nights to do things.
1494014	1495736	I haven't quite done that yet.
1495756	1501102	I know Codeman's going in there and he's doing videos of some of the Mob Arena stuff.
1501642	1505687	That needs to be fixed and balanced.
1506038	1506578	Thanks for watching!
1524687	1529050	I've actually just been having fun digging my holes, which is pretty much all my houses are.
1529111	1529971	They're holes in the ground.
1529991	1530792	Like you do on the show.
1530892	1532413	Just dig your own holes all night.
1533254	1535876	You've seen my house, haven't you?
1536056	1536677	My prairie dog?
1536697	1537537	Well, your Minecraft house?
1537577	1537857	No, I haven't.
1537877	1538438	Minecraft house.
1538478	1538678	No.
1539098	1541160	It's a series of underground tunnels.
1541821	1543242	I haven't been on Minecraft in like a month.
1543302	1543802	Shame on me.
1543862	1544923	I get yelled at all the time.
1545464	1546024	Yelled at over it.
1547355	1547635	Alright.
1547915	1549876	I know, I keep looking at your half-finished house all the time.
1549896	1550936	I know, I need to finish it.
1551276	1552736	Alright, anything else you want to share for Gaming Week?
1552756	1553056	That's it.
1553157	1555577	Wait until you hear what I have been playing and you're going to be like, God damn it, Rob.
1556017	1557398	Alright, so my Gaming Week.
1557438	1567040	Well, I was driving around town hoping somebody broke street on Tomb Raider, because I heard a lot of places were selling Tomb Raider early, but I couldn't find any, so I guess I'll have to wait like everybody else.
1567440	1567780	Boo.
1570001	1572141	How can you not want Tomb Raider after the Conan review?
1574622	1585552	Although, Conan, I love his review thing, it's kind of hit and miss and stuff, but my god are the deaths in that so violent and frequent.
1586132	1589415	It's kind of, I think Jamie would like the game actually for that reason.
1589635	1590015	What game?
1590456	1590996	Tomb Raider.
1591276	1591797	Oh, the new one?
1592017	1602321	Yes, because there's stuff, you know, okay, you gotta go left, oh, you gotta go right, oh, you didn't go right fast enough, and now she impales her neck on a stick very violently.
1602621	1603482	That sounds awesome.
1604222	1607323	Yeah, I wasn't... One of our listeners got me the last one, the Guardian of Light.
1607663	1607964	Oh, yeah?
1608524	1608984	So, thank you.
1609244	1611345	I wasn't... Well, Guardian of Light is so different, though.
1611365	1612265	I love Guardian of Light, though.
1612285	1612865	That was a great game.
1612905	1615386	But, yeah, I wasn't really prepared.
1615486	1621589	I mean, I should have known better because, like, you know, I know Tomb Raider was all about the death scenes back in the day, but it was a little more cartoony back then.
1622469	1624150	Locking the butler in the fridge.
1624290	1634834	Some of that stuff now, like, when I saw that whole, like, impale scene, I was like, oh, maybe, maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm having second thoughts about this purchase because, you know, I'm not huge on the violence, but...
1635634	1636234	I'll deal with it.
1636614	1638655	From what I hear, it's limited.
1638675	1640636	I wonder if you can still make her break her own neck.
1641096	1641756	Oh yeah, probably.
1641776	1642776	Oh, I'm sure you can.
1643356	1644237	It wouldn't be Tomb Raider if you couldn't.
1644257	1645057	Because that's fun.
1645297	1647058	And I still want to lock the butler in the freezer.
1647398	1648978	Because that was the only thing I ever did in 2.
1649098	1649678	Maybe you can.
1649698	1651759	It wouldn't surprise me if they have throwbacks to...
1652139	1654441	Well, then again, her mansion's not really in this one, huh?
1654461	1655262	Because it's a reboot.
1655802	1656543	It's a prequel.
1656763	1658044	She doesn't have a butler yet.
1658084	1659245	You'll have to hope for a new one.
1659465	1663569	Maybe at the end of the game when she gets to her mansion or something like that.
1664149	1665710	She gets a letter from her butler.
1666051	1667772	Dear ma'am, I'm still in the freezer.
1667852	1668773	Please let me out.
1669454	1670755	Sincerely, your butler.
1671688	1672589	Rob, that is gross.
1672609	1673129	You paid $60 for this, Rob.
1691184	1692685	You should be trying to rape her.
1692785	1694725	You should be saving your money, Rob.
1694765	1696046	Get a 401k.
1696366	1698867	SSG 100 Matt said the best.
1699807	1701408	You should reread that in your mom's voice.
1701768	1703209	Rob, that's gross, Rob.
1703229	1703889	Through her neck.
1704009	1704609	Come on, Rob.
1704629	1706210	That would totally be her.
1706710	1707590	All right.
1707610	1709171	So let's talk about what I... I adore your mom.
1709491	1710191	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
1725900	1726860	What am I smoking?
1727060	1727620	I don't know.
1728121	1735682	I think the fact that I've been into Path of Exile lately made me go like, maybe I should go back and try Diablo 3 because I was enjoying Path of Exile.
1736462	1742623	People say Diablo 3 is... Extrofer was like, you need to go back because a lot of it's patches and all this.
1743423	1744724	And I've actually been enjoying it.
1744764	1749024	I've got to admit, I think part of that is the fact that nobody else is playing Diablo 3 right now.
1749584	1752345	You don't get people jumping in on your game?
1752805	1753746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1777485	1805301	and I said you know what I'm going to play this through one time just me at my own pace because I think part of what broke the game for me was that having people jump in your game as much as it's nice to be social and all that like it paces the game a lot differently because people will be off kind of doing their own thing you got to go back to town and sell stuff but you don't want to miss some of the exploration and the XP and you know I don't know like so I kind of want to just I want to play this game by myself for a little bit one time but always connected to the internet
1805925	1816354	Yes, but it's always connected to the internet, which is ridiculous in its own right, but hey, at least I got the game complimentary with the whole Warcraft Pass thing, so I can't complain too much about that.
1816374	1818375	I may have to reinstall it and give it another go.
1819036	1826322	I didn't dislike it, I just didn't like not being able to rotate the camera and getting a better view, so that was really my biggest pet peeve.
1826382	1830245	That and people jumping in my game, which I had turned it off and people were still jumping in my game.
