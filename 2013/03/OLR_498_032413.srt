00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight, March 24th, 2013, new games are shown at PAX East

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Wii U shop age restrictions are lifted in Europe

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and could an exploit in Origin allow malicious code on your PC?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, it's called Origin. Hi!

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hey, that was my line.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello, everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live for this March 24th, 2013, the 498th episode of our show.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining over the next few hours to talk about video games with my co-host.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Please say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm eating something evil thanks to Loki.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And I totally stole her joke and it was funny.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You bitch.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know. Here, here's a quarter for that joke. Here's a cup of coffee for that joke.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I love this coffee. It's very delicious.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Alright, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I ate so many breadsticks that my head hurts now.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who's bringing the food? Supply and Oil, our studios with breadsticks.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I ate most of it. It's just I couldn't finish the last two. I mean, ten was enough.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You guys didn't know this, but every week at OLR is a potluck, you know, where everybody brings a dish.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I bring the coffee, which is funny because Loki doesn't drink coffee.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Loki brings the pizza and breadsticks and DarkSakura brings...

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Healthy stuff.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Gross.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Salad and Chinese food.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Who wants that? Chinese food isn't that healthy.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I bring you coffee sometimes.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It depends what you get at Chinese food, right? Depends what you get.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I went to Panda and I had the Mandarin chicken with no sauce over vegetables and fried rice.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Delicious.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Alright, we're not a food show, believe it or not, but we are a show about video games.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sure PAX East, on a lot of your minds, we're going to be talking about some of the news that came out of PAX East.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Sadly, I didn't get a chance to go this year.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I went to PAX East the very first year, which was, I think, 2010, right?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I went to PAX East that year. I had a great time.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sadly, it's a little tricky to get out to Boston from here, you know.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's a bit of a plane trip.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And just with my day job and everything, there was no way I was going to get out there this year.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But I'll tell you what, y'all made me jealous through your Twitter updates and your forum posts and all that stuff I was watching.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Y'all made me jealous I wasn't at PAX East.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But keep the pictures coming.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I saw a lot of VOG people, it looked like, were in somebody's hotel room drinking responsibly, I hope.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Playing Cards Against Humanity at 3 a.m., pictures were going up.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, good times.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Very happy to see that all you guys are having a good time.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I know we had some of our shows at the Voice of Geeks Network.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Remember, Orange Launch Radio does tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or VOGNetwork.com.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Not tonight, though, because Bobby is one of those folks that was at PAX East and he's on a plane home right now.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, Bobby. So this is now the Mass Effect show.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I think the entire group from Anime Jam Session was there.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think Rama, Giovanni, Ari Rockefeller, they were all there.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And Critical Myth, I know, was there.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's see, we're trying to think who else from VOG shows.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I think that was it from the show shows, because obviously the gals from Britain didn't come out for it.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And British Invaders, ones in Canada, ones in Britain.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't think they went out for it either.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But certainly a lot of shows. So they'll be giving you some updates throughout the week.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm hoping some of our regulars, because a lot of our regulars were there.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Misty was there, Matt was there, Rama was there.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm hoping to get some calls from people a little later on tonight to talk about PAX East and all that good stuff.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
For now, though, we weren't there. We're going to get into the big news that came out of PAX East in a little bit.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I have to ask, because this is what I ask every time there's a PAX...

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What was the Megafon event this year?

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, I was watching SEG's Twitter and he posted it and I forgot already.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It didn't sound like a new game or anything to me.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Maybe somebody in chat can help us out there.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Live.vognetwork.com is our chat room.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And act deft in our chat room live tonight, confirming yes, Critical Myth, AJS, and Bobby Blackwall for all there.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So, awesome. I'm looking forward to hearing their commentary on the show throughout the week.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But the real party is here.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's right. And as we get closer to our 500th episode here at Orange Lounge Radio.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
One thing I wanted to talk about tonight, we were talking about just before we went live tonight.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We were kind of looking back because, what was it? Somebody joined chat.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What's this guy's name? Catastrophic Moggy joined chat.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And I was getting that name confused in my head with a guy that used to be here locally that was Moogle Hunter.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I think it was his name or something like that.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So we were talking about all these people from, I'm talking like the old school O.L.R. days.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Like back when we had the edit contest of the DDR machine and some of the people we had on the show.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Like I was talking about, remember Rick and Paul and Dave, I was thinking about them.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And we were thinking about it. We're like, God, I wonder where they are now.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And I think Jamie had started to say, well, they were in high school or something like that.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I was going to a high paid school.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, and I was like, oh, my God, like Dave was like 17 back when the show started.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He's like 27. He probably has kids now.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So here's my little request for what it's worth.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And another old school person is in the mailbag tonight.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I know we're going to get to that later.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I would really love to hear from some of these really old school people that used to be on the show a long time ago.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My house is open to you all that can make it on April 14th, which is the big show.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Bring me birthday presents.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, just so y'all know, no show next week.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm registered.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Easter, Episode 499 is April 7th.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is that right? Yeah, April 7th. And then Episode 500 is April 14th.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So I would really love for the old school people to show up.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I would love to see Anita, who I know is the DDR angel, if she can make it.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You know, just some of the old school people would crack me up.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I chatted with her on Steam the other day. Yeah, it was nice.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, yeah, I see her. I see her hubby on Google Plus all the time.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We sometimes exchange our recipes and things, too. Sometimes.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, I know she runs a blog now and all that.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Her blog is awesome. It's called The Eco Maker.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Anyone who wants good home stuff, check it out.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It was Space Team. Space Team. Is that an old school game?

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No, it's a new Android mobile game. It's a cooperative team game or something.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't know.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I heard a girl won, which is interesting because it was not Pork Buns.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It was on the show last week, two weeks ago.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The gal we had on the show last week, sadly, she got eliminated the first round in Bomberman.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's the curse of coming on OLR.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Come on this show after you're done with your competition.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Remember when we had that girl from The Tester on the show and then she was off the show?

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She was after it, though.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's true. It was all pre-taped.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I still like to think there's a bit of a curse here at Orange Lounge Radio.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So, yes. Episode 500, I want you old school Sacramento's DDR community.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I want you guys here in the house.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I remember trying to register that as an address.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, really?

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Why I had to get Sacbimani instead.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know who I know?

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Because some Catholic organization registered it.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know who I know would come?

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Who?

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And who I am friends with on Facebook and I literally haven't seen.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We just keep in touch on Facebook. Miss Janae.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And she married Dark Child. Did you know that?

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes. And she has a little one.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes. They had a baby.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes.

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This show is so fucking old.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't have a baby. I have a cat.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
She's a lot better than a baby.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I have a cat, too. I love kitties.

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She doesn't drool on me. However, she does chew on cords.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Loki has a baby. Well, not even a baby anymore. He's like a toddler.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You guys weren't bowling the other day, right?

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You have a small person.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He's like almost three.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, my God. The video was adorable, though. The bowling.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Did you guys have fun?

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's a short video.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah. The long video. Yeah.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He didn't let us bowl.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Because we have the little ramp thing.

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Because he can't carry the ball.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I mean, the latest ball is like six pounds.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He might be able to carry that, but I'm not going to have him carry a big ball that's got the oil from the lane on it and stuff.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You know, with his feet. No, that's not a good idea.

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So he had fun just pushing it down the little ramp so that it would knock stuff over.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But he wouldn't let us have a turn.

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I managed to bowl twice and my wife once and he bowled like, you know, two whole games worth of, you know, turns for three people.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Catastrophic Moggy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What is this? A show about gaming or a trip down memory lane?

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now, I'm sure that comment is tongue in cheek and you don't really mean anything negative by it.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But you know what? When you've been gaming with the same crowd for so long.

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And, you know, you guys have to remember when we did the DDR stuff, we were really heavy into Dance Dance Revolution.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We would meet at the arcade every Wednesday.

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It was it was like clockwork every Wednesday or whatever day it was at the time.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We'd go, we'd play some DDR for a few hours.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Then we'd go and have dinner, sit down.

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You kind of build up a little bit of a family.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So, yeah, you know why? It is a little more than just video games.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's about family, just like a lot of my second cat.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A lot of the same people turn up here and chat every week.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm on my second cat.

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I know. We've been through a lot.

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But we'll reminisce more in a couple of weeks.

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Memory all alone.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You just want an excuse to sing songs from cats.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
All right. Let's see. That's it.

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I think for the pre-week gaming banter, we'll get into the actual news from PAX East in a minute.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But we're going to start off the show tonight, as we do always, talking about our gaming weeks

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and the video games that we've been playing this week.

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
DarkSakura.

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Of course, I played Mass Effect because I got the high-res mod working on Mass Effect 3.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You have all of it.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No.

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
OK.

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's OK.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I played, yeah, I played Mass Effect 3, got the high-res mod working,

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and then it started crashing whenever I would do the Tango.

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I figured out that the problem was my coalesced.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And I was what was doing it to me.

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Because I had everything set by the old version of the high-res mod.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And the new version doesn't require you to change any of your texture settings in the coalesced file.

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So I went and used my old coalesced file. Everything worked fine.

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The only problem that I have with it is that it makes all of James' textures black.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Just like the textures won't load on him.

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So I still don't know how to fix that.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Otherwise everything works and it looks beautiful.

198
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Tango down. Tango down.

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But the cool thing about this mod is that one of the textures that comes with it

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
is one where you can sort of see Tali's face through her mask.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And she's got the extra little bits they photoshopped on that one picture in Mass Effect 3

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
if you happen to be romancing her.

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So I thought it was a neat touch.

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
She's got the little bits on her eyebrows.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So anyway, I also played some Mass Effect 2.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Which I have now figured out how to use Ashley's skin and hair.

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Except with a completely different face structure so it doesn't quite look like Ashley.

208
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And I'm using Morin's outfit.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So I've been playing around a little bit.

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I've gotten the game to crash once. I was proud of myself.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And then... I'm not doing the fandango act daft.

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I also started The Secret World.

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And the problem is that I've had a sinus infection all week.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
As I've said on a previous episode, this time of year, sinus infections.

215
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Like you wouldn't believe. Allergies all over the place.

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And so I got through the very beginning of the Templar scenario.

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And then I was like, oh my god, gunfire. My head hurts.

218
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can't look at this anymore. Bleh.

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So...

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The Secret World's at MMO. I remember playing this too in beta.

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Is it totally free now? Or is it paid a Guild Wars model?

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You can pay a subscription and get all the premium shit.

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Or you can buy a few things here and there.

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I just have the completely freebie model.

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And it's okay. I haven't gotten too much into it. The control's alright.

226
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But I did sign up for the next Final Fantasy XIV beta.

227
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So hopefully that'll work out for me.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I haven't cancelled WoW yet. Every time I think I am, I was like, oh but I'll miss everybody.

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Just a tip on that Final Fantasy XIV beta though.

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If you do get in, it's under NDA. And you're not even supposed to say if you're in the beta.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I know.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Trust me, it would be a real shame if you got into the beta for Final Fantasy XIV.

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You couldn't talk about it on this show.

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Even though you very much wanted to talk about everything that you were seeing in the beta.

235
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But you couldn't do that if you're under NDA. Trust me, I've heard from very close, very respected, very handsome sources.

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
All I said is that I applied for it.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I applied and said, yeah, I own every single one of these consoles that's on this list. What's your point?

238
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Except for the 3DS and the Vita. I own the good consoles on that list.

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hey, the Vita and the 3DS are cool.

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And god, I was going to play Mirror's Edge and Dan's like, you're going to throw up, you're going to get sick, don't play it, you're going to get sick, you're going to get sick.

241
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm like, fine, I'm going to play it.

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes, the show is on whoever you are, VOG155.

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Tell us about your week. Don't re-chat.

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, shit.

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, I played Mass Effect 3. Shut up, Raginator.

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So, uh, yeah.

247
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Alright, see, they derail you when you go to look at chat when they're in mid-science, it derails you.

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's just, most of the time, I didn't really have much of an energy to play much of anything.

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Just because I was on so many damn sinus medicines.

250
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Like, I was on Daquil, Sudafed, Benadryl, and Allegra in various doses, and then Nyquil.

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, get better, dammit.

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I feel much better today. It's just, my nose feels like it's, you know, the Sahara.

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
ActDeft is asking about Mirror's Edge. Was that something you were supposed to start this week?

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, that's what I was going to start this week was Mirror's Edge.

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And that's the one that Dan says, you're going to get sick.

256
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm like, fine, I'm going to get sick, meh.

257
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's pretty, though.

258
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, I'm going to play it. I just want to wait until, because the other problem is that all this week I've had bad equilibrium issues.

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And I don't know if I've made it evident to our lovely listeners yet, I've started drawing again.

260
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And we actually rearranged the vault slash computer room to where I have my year old desk, pretty much, the table.

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And there is my drawing surface. So I've actually been dedicating quite a bit of time to rebuilding lost skills.

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And it's been, but I've been trying to, when I play a game, if I'm, you know, pausing at a point in it,

263
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm actually starting to sketch out what's on my screen, just to sort of help me with proportion and space and distance and that type of thing.

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's been a pretty interesting exercise. But I figured my first love has been, you know, video games and art. So why not?

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And your second love is Garrus.

266
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
My second love is Dan. Garrus is third.

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Alright. Loki, how was your-

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh, followed by the Guardian Legend.

269
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's see, I played Garry's Mod this week. I actually bought that on their little Steam sale that they have for some indie stuff. It was only three bucks.

271
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And I was trying to get to work with the game, you know, the Xbox 360 controller.

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And it's a little awkward because they don't have the keys mapped out quite correctly. So I couldn't really do a whole ton.

273
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And also I kept losing my gravity gun, which was kind of annoying because I can't arrange stuff without that.

274
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And so basically all I was able to do was throw a large iron beam in the air and crush myself with it.

275
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And so that was kind of boring.

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Instead I went and tried to- well, that kind of prompted me to look into some other games that supported controllers.

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And I had Cave Story Plus, which I knew that supported controllers, but for some reason I couldn't find-

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I didn't look, I guess, for the options for the controller support.

279
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And then I found it, and so I started playing that. And so I'm enjoying that quite a bit.

280
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I also played more Saints Row the Third, both on PC and Xbox 360.

281
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And going through grinding through the activities, man. I hope the next game doesn't do that.

282
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh, let me introduce you to these activities that you've played before. They didn't do that in the second game.

283
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They didn't even do that in the first game. They just had the activities there.

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The third game, half the missions are just like, hey, you have to do this activity for this reason,

285
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
even though it doesn't really quite apply to the game.

286
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Before Saints Row 2 and 1, it was like drug trafficking. Now it's merchandise trafficking.

287
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's like, really? Come on, these guys are like big time gangsters now, and we're trafficking merchandise?

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Like bobbleheads and shit? That's kind of stupid.

289
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Or, you know, oh, hey, you're kind of even going along with that.

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There's like an escort mission where you have to escort them with a chopper.

291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's like Guardian Angel is what it's called.

292
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And half the time you're firing rockets out of the side of a helicopter,

293
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and then the other time you're, for some reason, repelled down the side of a building and sniping.

294
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Like, you could snipe on top of the building.

295
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You have to repel down the building a little bit for some damn reason to snipe.

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Because, you know, snipers never take position on roofs. They always repel halfway down the roof, you know.

297
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It just makes no sense.

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And it's one of the things I didn't really like originally in the game.

299
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That and the Saints book activities are kind of annoying too, but I haven't gotten to that again yet.

300
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Which is why I'm so pissed off that I lost my save in the first place, because I had all that shit done.

301
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I was one activity, or one car theft away from completing all of the activities and all the Saints book stuff.

302
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And then, of course, you know, lost my save.

303
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So, that was fun.

304
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Unfortunately, I also had Bioshock Infinite to play.

305
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Haven't gotten the chance to do that, because I was cooking this morning.

306
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And also the Defiance Beta on 360.

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But, by the time I get to play it, the beta is going to be over and Defiance will be out next week.

308
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Or, the week after next.

309
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
All those Bioshock Infinite reviews ought to start hitting tomorrow, right?

310
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Because the game's out Tuesday?

311
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah.

312
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Am I right? Yeah.

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, I mean, there was the one from IGN, because, you know.

314
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
They bought it.

315
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah, they bought it.

316
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But I'm sure the game's great.

317
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's going to be fantastic.

318
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm sure the game's great, yeah.

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Unlike the Walking Dead game, holy shit.

320
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's been a source of comedy this week, hasn't it?

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's like, yeah.

322
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
EA's been, I bet they're glad that, you know, the Walking Dead game.

323
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's like, seriously, one company after the next.

324
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I wonder who's going to have this shitty game next.

325
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Is Injustice going to be any good?

326
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I hope so.

327
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Or, like, you know, maybe Defiance.

328
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Because it is based off a sci-fi series.

329
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So, that's not absolutely positive.

330
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah, my money's on Injustice, actually.

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But, we'll see, we'll see.

332
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I can't shade a game.

333
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Dead Island Riptide, maybe.

334
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I can't shade a game I haven't played Saints Row IV.

335
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's a ways away.

336
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Some of the feedback coming out of PAX East is pretty good.

337
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Again, I can't shade a game I haven't played.

338
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's the thing, that's what's confusing me.

339
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Because, like, I've been, you know, I'm going to buy Saints Row IV.

340
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Just because...

341
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You're a whore for Saints Row, and that's fine.

342
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I like Saints Row, but at the same time, what they've shown me

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
isn't necessarily giving me the most confidence that this game's going to be good.

344
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Like, first off, Saints Row III, I really wish it was more toned back towards 2.

345
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
2 was the best.

346
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It was, like, the best, you know, balance between, like, a gritty game

347
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and, like, you know, ridiculous, you know.

348
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But then 3 just, like, we're just going to go crazy.

349
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And then 4, like, we're going even crazier.

350
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, and we're going to have a...

351
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
A dubstep gun.

352
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Come on, that's hilarious.

353
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

354
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's funny.

355
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We're going to have a...

356
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
We're going to have a...

357
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Was it a...

358
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
A lot of DLC, basically.

359
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm like, yeah, I remember the DLC from Saints Row III.

360
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Your 20-minute mission.

361
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I need someone who is at PAX East and played the game to call in and tell...

362
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No one played the game.

363
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
No one played the game.

364
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They watched a video.

365
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh.

366
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
A short video.

367
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It wasn't playable?

368
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Nope.

369
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
10-minute video they watched.

370
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It would have been playable, but anyway.

371
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's why it's not coming to the Wii.

372
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's not because they fucking hate the Wii.

373
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's because they have the engine done already and they're not going to port it.

374
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
All right.

375
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

376
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's it.

377
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
My gaming week.

378
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I had a very Blizzard-tastic week because, obviously, I played a lot of WoW.

379
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I've been working on a Hunter, who's, like, my PvP character and been having fun with

380
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
her.

381
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Did I mention last week on the show?

382
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I can't remember when this happened, but I sold an item on the Real Money Auction House

383
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
on Diablo III.

384
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No, you didn't mention that.

385
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yes, I sold...

386
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Guess how much I made?

387
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
A dollar.

388
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I made 25 cents.

389
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah.

390
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Woohoo.

391
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Because the minimum you can list an item for is $1.25.

392
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So that's what I put the item up for.

393
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And then the transaction fee is always $1.

394
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
No matter what it sells for.

395
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So $1.25 minus $1.

396
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
25 cents, baby.

397
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Woohoo.

398
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It worked for you.

399
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I can put that towards a card pack in Hearthstone, but we'll get to that later.

400
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So, yeah, I've been having fun with Diablo III, believe it or not.

401
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Like, I'm just...

402
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm kind of into it right now.

403
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's good.

404
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Also, I played StarCraft.

405
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
No, I did not play that new expansion, but all my friends kind of going back to StarCraft

406
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
because of that expansion made me want to load up the game.

407
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And I was like, whoa, the launcher, like, totally changed for this.

408
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But I loaded up Star Jeweled, because Star Jeweled is, like, the reason for me to play

409
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
StarCraft.

410
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And no, I don't have the new expansion.

411
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And until I sell about, oh, I don't know, 100 more items on that real money auction

412
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
house.

413
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I mean, if I can raise 40 bucks in Diablo III, I'll buy it.

414
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But if I make a quarter every two weeks, I don't think that's going to happen pretty

415
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
soon.

416
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So, there was that.

417
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I've been playing some console stuff, too.

418
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I have to admit, I played the Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate demo on Wii U.

419
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The demo's awful, you guys.

420
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It is awful.

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And here's the thing.

422
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Like, I have friends that are really into that game right now that are, like, having

423
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
a lot of fun with it.

424
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And one way it was kind of described to me is that it's, like, Phantasy Star Online,

425
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
kind of, but a lot more grindy because it's a JRPG.

426
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But I played this demo on Wii U.

427
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And I just, like, the reason why I want to bring it up, not that I like to review games

428
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
based on the demo, but here's the reality.

429
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That's what happens.

430
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
A lot of people do make their opinions based on the full game on the demo.

431
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I mean, we've heard Bobby to death on his show talking about the Ni No Kuni and how

432
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
he hated that demo.

433
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And, yeah, that was a pretty shitty demo, too.

434
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And, again, here we have a case of a demo that's even worse.

435
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Like, it just, it doesn't tell you anything about the game.

436
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It doesn't set up anything.

437
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What you're doing, there's this assumption that you'll just figure it out.

438
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And it's just unacceptable.

439
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Like, I can't figure out, like, why gaming companies don't know that or why they can't

440
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
invest 25 cents to create a splash screen that at least kind of details, like, we're

441
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
throwing you midway into the game and here's what's going on and here's the controls.

442
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
But I just thought it was fucking boring.

443
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Like, it was seriously fucking boring.

444
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I got this guy with a giant sword and I figured out that the monster I wanted was on my mini

445
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
map.

446
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So I went to him and I button mashed to figure out what the attack buttons were for about

447
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
20 minutes.

448
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And, finally, I caught it and it was like, doo doo, demo done.

449
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And I was like, that was the most boring fucking thing I've done all week long.

450
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Like, way to sell your game.

451
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And so now I'm like, okay, but my friends like really-

452
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Was laundry more fun?

453
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It was.

454
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Like, I know there are Monster Hunter fans that listen to this show that are like, Rob,

455
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
you're so ignorant.

456
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The demo doesn't show this.

457
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That doesn't work for me.

459
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Like, if the company is going to sell me on the game, sell me on the game.

460
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So now if I'm to be sold on this game, either I'm going to have to go play it at a friend's

461
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
house who's going to have to explain to me what's going on.

462
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Maybe I'll put it in my Gamefly queue, but it's not like something I'm like-

463
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The urgency of doing so just dropped a whole lot.

464
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let me just put it that way.

465
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So, let's see.

466
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Go into comments from chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

467
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
ActDef says, Rob, you need to play Team Fortress 2 more.

468
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You can sell stuff for over a hundred US dollars.

469
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You know, I actually like, I was seriously going to boot up Team Fortress 2 the other

470
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
night and then I got distracted and did something else.

471
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And it was because of like last week's show.

472
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Orange Right in our chat room agrees with me about Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate.

473
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That demo did not sell me on the game at all.

474
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And it's a pity.

475
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And you know what?

476
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And I kind of have to remind myself.

477
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Ni No Kuni had a pretty bad demo too.

478
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But the full game's great.

479
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And like, I don't know what convinced me to take the leap of faith there.

480
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Or like I refused to do it in Monster Hunter.

481
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
But maybe because the Ni No Kuni demo, I kind of figured it out.

482
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And it was fun in the long run once I finally figured it out.

483
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't know.

484
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
One other game I played this week.

485
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I just bought it today.

486
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So I haven't had a lot of time to play it.

487
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But I did buy Luigi's Mansion on 3DS.

488
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And so I've only got to do some of the early levels.

489
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Like where you go into that first little mansion.

490
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I did not play the GameCube version.

491
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Which I know a lot of people might be like, what?

492
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But I didn't get my GameCube until well after the launch stuff.

493
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
In fact, I remember Loki bought me the GameCube.

494
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's a really awesome present.

495
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
When Animal Crossing came out.

496
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Hell yeah.

497
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
At that point, Animal Crossing was all the rage at that point.

498
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
We didn't have time for Luigi's Mansion or any of the launch titles.

499
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So I never played the original one.

500
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But I've played the new one.

501
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But only a little bit.

502
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So I can't really give it a full review.

503
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But I will say, some pretty good 3D effects.

504
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And it really reminds me.

505
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And this is a compliment.

506
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It really reminds me of an old school PC game.

507
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Like just in the way you're kind of walking around the mansion on the top screen.

508
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And it's like you're finding items.

509
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It for some reason kind of reminds me of an old school puzzler.

510
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Like an old LucasArts game almost.

511
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
With a little more action though, obviously.

512
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Because you're sucking in the ghosts and all that.

513
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And you can find him hanged.

514
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
No multiplayer or anything like that yet.

515
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Because I've literally only played the game like 30 minutes.

516
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So I can't tell you anymore about it at this time.

517
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But it was fun and the 3D effects were fun.

518
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I like the whole little pixelator thing.

519
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It looks like something out of Tron.

520
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That cracked me up.

521
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So, yeah. So Luigi's Mansion 3DS.

522
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And that was my gaming week.

523
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

524
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Again, I think I mentioned this before.

525
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But I just want to make sure you all know there is no Orange Lounge Radio next week.

526
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Have a great Easter or Sunday off.

527
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'll be drunk on mimosas.

528
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Will ya? Oh, from brunch?

529
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No, where we're going for brunch, Murray Calendars, they give you like never-ending mimosas.

530
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
A lot of places do that for brunch.

531
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm so happy.

532
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
That's like the friends that I have downtown that we like to go to brunch with all the time.

533
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Like, we can't go to a place unless they have endless mimosas.

534
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Because our one friend is like, no, I'm not going if I can't get mimosas.

535
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So, good times.

536
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Anyhow, so no show next week, but we will be back on April 7th.

537
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I believe Bobby's here next week.

538
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So, those of you guys that turn out here pretty loyally on Sunday night,

539
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
you'll have something to look forward to next week.

540
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
There may be a best of or something, but there won't be a pre-recorded show

541
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
because we're intentionally setting it up so that we know episode 500 is on this day.

542
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So, that way we can kind of plan a little bit.

543
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Alright, I think that's it.

544
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio, yada yada.

545
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Let's get into gaming news. Loki.

546
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Well, this was completely unexpected, but Capcom announced, I guess,

547
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
a little bit ahead of their World of Capcom panel.

548
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Or even, actually, I think it was teased before, but announced after World of Capcom panel

549
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
that they're going to be remastering DuckTales, like the old NES DuckTales game,

550
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
which is pretty fantastic.

551
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You should have seen the flappy hands I made when I heard that news.

552
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That was really unexpected.

553
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yes, very unexpected.

554
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And basically, it's going to have hand-drawn sprites.

555
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's going to have all the original voices.

556
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And it's coming to Wii U, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade, 15 bucks.

557
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Probably, I want to say it was, I think it was this summer, maybe?

558
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I don't know if they had a date yet on that.

559
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
But yes, all the original voice actors are supposed to be coming back,

560
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
including, I guess, the guy, the Scrooge, who's in his 90s.

561
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Wow.

562
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
No, no.

563
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
He's in his 70s. Somebody else on the cast.

564
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The Magic of Dispel voice actress is 90.

565
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh, okay.

566
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But she's been doing voices for Disney for years.

567
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Right, exactly.

568
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
No, I think the guy-

569
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Wasn't she also a Granny Gummy?

570
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
She might have been.

571
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
The guy who does Uncle Scrooge was also Mr. Ed way back in the day.

572
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Wow.

573
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Remember that show?

574
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah.

575
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We weren't even alive when that show was on.

576
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But we had Nick at Night.

577
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah, they used to rerun the shit out of it on Nickelodeon when we were younger,

578
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
so that's how I remember it.

579
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I freaking loved Mr. Ed.

580
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm just, it's really surprising that they are redoing this.

581
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm surprised they would even do that.

582
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I think it's great.

583
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But seriously, when you're watching that trailer for the first time,

584
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and SSJ100Matt, who is at the show, is saying in chat room,

585
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
PAX East blew up when I was there.

586
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I can only imagine.

587
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And how epic was that trailer?

588
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Did you see the trailer they put out for it,

589
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
where it has those quotes that are like,

590
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
this is the series that defined a generation,

591
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and all these inspirational quotes.

592
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And then it says, come on everybody, sing along.

593
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Did you see this Dark Sakura?

594
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Oh.

595
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
No, I didn't.

596
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Well then, now I have an excuse to play it.

597
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Stop asking me for quotes, Tim Schafer.

598
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You had an excuse already, Rob.

599
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm going to give you the clip notes version, though, here, okay?

600
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So, like, here's Capcom, and like the inspirational music,

601
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and the few games are so rich with such a wealth of, right?

602
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So it's like setting up for it.

603
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And then, okay, so after all that.

604
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Ready, sing along.

605
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I like that it has the bopping head.

606
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But look how it looks.

607
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I mean, it looks awesome.

608
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah.

609
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
How can I cut this off early?

610
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Like, I have to let it play.

611
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The only thing I'm disappointed is they didn't show the moon.

612
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Well, they got to keep something a secret.

613
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
They got to save something.

614
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It looks like there was only Transylvania in there and one other stage.

615
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Well, it also can't be complete.

616
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah, it's probably not done yet.

617
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I didn't watch gameplay.

618
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Apparently, they retweeted all the bosses, so they're harder now.

619
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Nice.

620
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Like, they have more sequences to them.

621
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You have to remember, as awesome as the game as DuckTales was,

622
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
it really was only like six stages.

623
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It was about as long as the first Mega Man game, right?

624
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah.

625
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It wasn't a whole lot to it, so I don't know if they're like adding or whatever.

626
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But seriously, when I just heard, I was like, oh, WayForward and Capcom?

627
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Who brokered that deal?

628
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Because that is like inspired genius for real.

629
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Because WayForward did a great job with the Double Dragon Neon,

630
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and they did some of these other remakes too.

631
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
They did the Contra game on DS.

632
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
They've done a lot of good stuff, and to trust them with DuckTales was genius.

633
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So when I saw the trailer, I was just like, yes.

634
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Didn't we all kind of go like, Capcom has made a lot of bad decisions in the past year,

635
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and this is the first time where you're like, oh my god, I can like them again.

636
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Like, we're sorry. Please love us.

637
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It's cool to like Capcom again.

638
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Here you go. Here's something you want to see.

639
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Have WayForward redo Link to the Past.

640
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Ah!

641
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Or, let's just see if we can take that further.

642
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Have them redo Super Metroid.

643
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Go into some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

644
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Gamergirl says, LOL, I'm still laughing because I had the lyrics wrong for so long.

645
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The trailer did kind of make a lot of you guys realize that, huh?

646
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah, but Dan regularly breaks into that theme song at my house,

647
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
so I have no excuse not to know that and the Darkwing Duck theme.

648
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Extover says, I admit that I didn't play much of the original NES game since we only rented it once,

649
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
but I'm amused and excited by the remaster.

650
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I didn't own it either, and I'm in the same boat.

651
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
We rented it like three times. I mean, you used to rent it all the time.

652
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I think I did own the game. I want to say I did own that.

653
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But that's what makes me more, because now that I'm an adult and I can buy whatever the hell I want,

654
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm going to own this. It's going to be great.

655
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Let's see.

656
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I should actually text Dan and see if he knows about it.

657
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Dark Tetsuya says, There's your list list.

658
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Series WayForward needs to update for 2013.

659
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That's a great idea, Dark Tetsuya. We're going to do that.

660
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Maybe not tonight, but soon.

661
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Let's see.

662
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Act F says, The moon is going to sound so fucking awesome.

663
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Technus says, $15, huh?

664
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah, it took five seconds for it to make me want to buy it.

665
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Ditto. Ditto.

666
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But here's the bottom line, as excited as we all are,

667
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
please don't fuck this up.

668
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Like, this is sacred territory, people, right?

669
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Please don't fuck this up.

670
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Just say it.

671
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Stop raping your childhood.

672
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
All right. Was that it on the start? Wasn't there another?

673
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah, that was it.

674
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Did we talk about the other series?

675
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The possibility that they said they were going to do

676
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Rescue Rangers, possibly, and some of this other stuff?

677
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh, God, that'd be awesome.

678
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah, no, it's in one of the other, I think it's in the second link.

679
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
They said that if this does well,

680
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
that there is the potential that they'll do, like,

681
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Rescue Rangers and some of the other Capcom Disney stuff.

682
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And I'm sitting there going, Mickey Mascarpane, Mickey Mascarpane.

683
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Which is kind of basic, but I loved it.

684
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You know what?

685
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I literally tripped over that cartridge the other day.

686
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Because Midna has been trying to get up on the shelves

687
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
to get to stuff, and she knocked it down.

688
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It was in the case and everything.

689
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Now, would this mean that maybe we'd start getting into

690
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
some of the later games, like Aladdin?

691
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Yeah, that was one of the other things they said.

692
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
They said, Chippendale Rescue Rangers, Darkwing Duck, and Aladdin.

693
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Darkwing Duck, I would be happy about.

694
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
SSJ-100 Matt says, from what I saw at the show,

695
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
they didn't mess it up.

696
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Thank heavens.

697
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Thank heavens.

698
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yeah, it looked good from what I saw.

699
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
They had the boss fight against, uh...

700
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Who was it? Magica the Spell.

701
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It was pretty awesome.

702
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So excited.

703
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.

704
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Here's the other thing I wanted to say about this.

705
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
They need to make sweet, sweet Disney love.

706
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I know we've got a Mega Man thing coming up later on,

707
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
but I have to bring this up.

708
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Like, why not just let WayForward do Mega Man?

709
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Dark Soccer.

710
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That made me spaz so hard, I dropped my mic.

711
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Like...

712
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I know, right?

713
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Why not just let them do Mega Man?

714
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Because they'll probably do the game we all want, right?

715
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So hopefully this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

716
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
We'll see.

717
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Actually, you know who should really be doing the next Mega Man,

718
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
if they did one,

719
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
would be letting the people who did the Street Fighter

720
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
cross Mega Man.

721
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh, the...

722
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I know what you're talking about.

723
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
The anniversary of the freebie that was on the internet.

724
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yeah.

725
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

726
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Maybe, maybe.

727
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
One of the other big games that came out of PAX East

728
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
was somewhat of a surprise announcement from Blizzard.

729
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You know, I have the other show, Hoard House,

730
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
where we talk a lot about World of Warcraft and things,

731
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and there were a lot of people thinking

732
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
that it was going to be, like, a big thing.

733
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Like, it was going to be another expansion

734
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
or that it was Titan,

735
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
even though Blizzard said time and time again it's not Titan.

736
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Well, it kind of did come out of left field.

737
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
This is not something people were predicting.

738
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
The game that Blizzard announced at PAX East

739
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
was called Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft.

740
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's a card game, basically.

741
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's a virtual card game.

742
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's going to be playable on PC, Mac, and iPad.

743
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Kind of think very similar to that Magic the Gathering game

744
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
they have on, you know, Xbox and PlayStation and iPad.

745
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But in fact, they even say,

746
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
hey, this is inspired partially out of our love of,

747
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
you know, Magic the Gathering and these other games.

748
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But I'm getting the feeling this is going to be really simplified,

749
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and obviously has Warcraft lore really woven into it.

750
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Don't they have a card game already?

751
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Blizzard?

752
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah.

753
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
They have a tangible, wow, trading card game.

754
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That's what I meant.

755
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
But this isn't that.

756
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I think it's a simpler version of that,

757
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and it's not meant to be a tangible game.

758
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It is a little weird because both of those exist,

759
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
but I think there's room for both.

760
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I mean, if Magic the Gathering can be successful

761
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
in both a tangible game and an online game,

762
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I don't see why Blizzard can't have two properties out there.

763
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Now, here's the thing.

764
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It is going to be a free game, but it's freemium.

765
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You earn more cards.

766
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You can earn them through playing the game,

767
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and you win medals when you do PVP against people.

768
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But you will also be able to buy expansion packs,

769
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
of course, with real money.

770
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
They're thinking about one dollar.

771
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's what they're thinking right now for the packs.

772
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Hearthstone will have 300 cards in the initial collection,

773
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and it's hero versus hero.

774
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You play as one of the nine Central Warcraft classes,

775
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
each represented by a hero.

776
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Thrall!

777
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You can play, I believe Thrall is the shaman.

778
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I know Anduin is the priest.

779
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Malfurion, I think, is the druid.

780
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You can play as one of the big characters,

781
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
and it looks really good.

782
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Dark Saga, did you see this at all?

783
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I think this is their trailer that talks about,

784
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
actually, let me see if I can find the match.

785
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So that Jaina would be mage.

786
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
If you buy me a little time here, I'll try to find the...

787
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Well, I'm broke, so I can't buy you anything.

788
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But, well, I'm trying to think over who...

789
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Here it is. Here's the gameplay video where it's...

790
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm going to go kind of midway into this here.

791
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Let me make this a little bigger so you can actually see it here.

792
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Your turn.

793
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You'll notice it's very cartoony and animated in the way it looks.

794
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh, you've got little panda houses.

795
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah, it definitely has some of the newer...

796
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Even though we only see old Warcraft characters in this,

797
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
it definitely has some of the newer inspired stuff.

798
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I quit playing Magic for a reason.

799
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Yeah, you don't think you'd be into this?

800
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
There was a time sink.

801
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Now, Loki, I could see them wanting people like you

802
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
who don't touch any Blizzard IPs as of right now.

803
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Someone like you would be great to get into this game.

804
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Any interest in this for you?

805
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Nope.

806
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Why not?

807
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I just don't care. I really don't care.

808
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But you're not a big card game person.

809
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
No, I'm not.

810
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Makes sense.

811
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Well, I'll give it a try.

812
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Some reason it reminds me of, like, Pagle.

813
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I mean, the screen looks like Pagle.

814
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Is it going to be free? Why not?

815
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah, that's where I'm at.

816
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That's how they get you hooked.

817
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
There was a lot of people on Twitter that were like,

818
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
this is going to be stupid.

819
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Well, at least they don't charge you to play it like Tetra Master.

820
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That's where my mind went, too,

821
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
is I was like, oh, remember when Tetra Master was in Final Fantasy XI?

822
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
He had to pay like a dollar a month to play it.

823
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
God, I never touched that.

824
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I did my 30-day free trial of Tetra Master,

825
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
and I think I maybe paid for one more month.

826
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It was fun.

827
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I didn't bother.

828
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
But it was like ten years ago, you know?

829
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And, I mean, technology's come a long way.

830
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I hated it.

831
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'll try this.

832
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yeah, I'll try this. Why not?

833
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I download it. If it sucks, delete it.

834
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It can't be worse than Yaris.

835
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That's right. It already looks better than Yaris.

836
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Ain't that the truth?

837
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And then if I keep selling stuff in Diablo,

838
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I can buy the expansion packs,

839
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
although that's exactly what Blizzard wants.

840
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And I bet we're going to see more of this,

841
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
especially when the Titan thing is revealed, the MMO.

842
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I bet there's going to be a lot of mini-

843
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I bet there'll be real money woven into that somehow

844
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
in its own little economy,

845
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
where Blizzard gets a little chunk of it every time.

846
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's an extremely profitable avenue for them.

847
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So, uh, yeah.

848
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Let's move on with more news.

849
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
By the way, we will have-

850
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Well, it's not a surprise to you anymore,

851
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
because I told you what it is.

852
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
We will have something special for the fifth-

853
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
for our, um, fifth, uh, centiversary.

854
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I guess that's how it would be for hundreds.

855
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Um, so here's glorious, beautiful news.

856
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Rob, we need to have Ding Dong the Witch's Dead

857
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
playing in the background.

858
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Um, but the, uh, CEO of EA, John Riccitello,

859
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
is that how you pronounce his name?

860
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Is stepping down on the 30th.

861
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yay, because he has butchered some of our favorite stuff.

862
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Um, basically the whole reason he's stepping down too

863
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
is because of fiscal, um, uh, depreciation in the company.

864
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Um, yeah, and like, he's basically saying that it has to do,

865
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
and I'm going to read you the quote,

866
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
My decision to leave EA is really all about my accountability

867
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
for the shortcomings in our, uh, financial results this year.

868
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It looks like we will likely come in at the low end

869
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
or slightly below the financial guidance we issued to the street.

870
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So, yeah, and you know what?

871
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I- you should have seen the wank on Twi- on a- on a Tumblr

872
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
when this- in the Mass Effect fan community.

873
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It was glorious and beautiful,

874
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and there were lots of dancing gifs.

875
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yep.

876
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Oh my God, those clothes.

877
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Is it really- is it really going to change anything?

878
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Well, the people next in line, let's see, we have, um,

879
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
right now the interim leader is going to be Larry Probst,

880
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
who was the, uh, CEO from 1991 to 2007,

881
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and likely candidates to replace, uh, is, uh, Frank Gibbo,

882
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
who is the president of EA Labels,

883
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
or their, um, COO Peter Moore,

884
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
who was, uh, once in charge of EA Sports

885
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
and worked for Microsoft during the Xbox 360 launch.

886
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Ah, I could see Peter Moore, yeah, yeah.

887
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Uh, let's see, Xtopher in chat says,

888
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
At least he took responsibility.

889
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Uh, yeah, I mean, at least he was-

890
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
it- it wasn't as good as the Groupon guy's goodbye letter.

891
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't know if you guys saw that a few weeks ago,

892
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
but that was good.

893
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You know- you know shit's bad if Valve says no.

894
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Uh, let's see, um, bonds006,

895
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I have to agree with this comment in our chatroom,

896
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
live.vognetwork.com, uh,

897
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Someone will take John's place and EA will be EA.

898
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And I don't think this is really going to change it.

899
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I think he's just the fall guy for, you know,

900
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
all this bam, bam, bam.

901
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Star Wars Old Republic didn't do as well as it was supposed to.

902
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Mass Effect 3's ending just, you know,

903
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
as much as I hate the link behind that.

904
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Well, yeah, but you know- you know the-

905
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
the whole big rush on that, the pressure came from EA.

906
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
True, okay, true, good point.

907
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Uh, and now SimCity, you know,

908
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and all that, they had to give free games away.

909
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
He's just, uh, head of the Hydra.

910
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
On top of that, though, this is coming out right before, um,

911
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
well, right after they found out that they're gonna be next, um,

912
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
again on the top ten list of worst companies to work for.

913
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So...

914
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Not to mention that they are also in the running for,

915
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and at least I haven't seen the voting, though, for it yet,

916
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
so I'm not sure if they've made it through the first round.

917
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
They're also on the, uh, list for worst company in America.

918
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I- who cares?

919
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I mean, isn't that all just a-

920
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yes, it's a popularity contest, or unpopularity contest.

921
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It's an internet trolling contest.

922
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's the reverse of a popularity contest.

923
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
At any rate, I- I would like to be hopeful

924
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
to see better things come out, to see a new direction,

925
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
you know, to see them stop snatching up companies left and right

926
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
and ruining their, uh-

927
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
fixed goddamn origin.

928
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I sat there for thirty- thirty minutes last night.

929
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Myself, Alan, Shane, and Tim all wanted to play multiplayer, right?

930
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So we're trying to play multiplayer Mass Effect,

931
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
but because Alan and I are in the same house,

932
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
we keep running into these problems where two of us can connect,

933
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
but then the others can't get in, it keeps timing out,

934
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
literally takes us thirty minutes to figure out,

935
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
we gotta crack the code.

936
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Okay, here's how we form the game.

937
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'll host the game, then Alan, you join.

938
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Now, Rob is gonna invite Tim, Alan will invite Shane,

939
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and then it'll work.

940
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That's what it took, honestly.

941
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
We had to mix and match the order of who joined when,

942
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
just to play stinkin' Mass Effect multiplayer.

943
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah.

944
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Fix origin.

945
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Do you want us to take it seriously?

946
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
More like butt-gin.

947
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh.

948
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But- but I'm- I'm still gonna-

949
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I mean, honestly, I think that origin, in and of itself,

950
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
is a bad business decision to go through, but I mean,

951
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
it's like I was saying before, you know shit's bad when Valve refuses your money.

952
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Well, but- but here's the thing, speaking of all that,

953
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
we have to remember Steam was pretty bad when it first launched,

954
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
everybody was pissed because it was bundled with Half-Life 2 and you had no choice,

955
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
there's a lot of that, so like, I wanna be hopeful and say,

956
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
maybe there's a light at the end of the tunnel and maybe this'll all turn out okay,

957
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
but I'm just- I just-

958
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
They keep fucking it up.

959
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I just don't have that same level of trust in EA right now.

960
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
They keep fucking it up. End of the story.

961
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And I mean, I love the entire Mass Effect series, even if there are-

962
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I like- I like to joke around and call 3 a sparkly turd.

963
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And there's lots of stuff in 3 that I love, I love the gameplay,

964
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I love scenes, I love parts of the story.

965
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It's just the whole lack of- what's the word I'm thinking of?

966
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Continuity, really going from game to game, changing writing staff,

967
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and you know that that pressure came from EA.

968
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Dungeon Buster in our chat room, kind of with another perspective,

969
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
like what about the good things Rickatello did?

970
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Dungeon Buster says the board probably forced him out,

971
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
EA stock has been on a brutal decline in the last few years,

972
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I don't disagree with that for sure.

973
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Dungeon Buster says Rickatello was also known for taking gambles

974
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
backing Dante's Inferno, Mirror's Edge, et cetera.

975
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I mean, for better or for worse, those were some original games.

976
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You know, I would say for better, Mirror's Edge, for worse.

977
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Don't think that.

978
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But for better or worse, got to work.

979
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
That's like asking what did Bush do good for the country?

980
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Oh, I knew you'd take it down a political route.

981
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:00,000
No, but seriously, I think I remembered reading on one other article

982
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
that their stock increased after the announcement.

983
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Just saying.

984
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Let's see, Raginator in chat at live.vognetwork.com says

985
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
which is worse to work for?

986
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
EA, Gamestop, or Emperor Palpatine?

987
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Which would be the worst to work for?

988
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I'd probably say...

989
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Mmm, that's really tough.

990
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
That was really tough.

991
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I mean, at least with Palpatine, like,

992
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
you don't have to worry about being unemployed

993
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
because you'd just be dead.

994
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Well, and as long as you're on the Death Star that they don't blow up,

995
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
you might have it pretty good.

996
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yeah, they fucked up every Death Star.

997
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I don't know. EA's going to hire me at corporate or game,

998
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
so I was going to hire me at corporate.

999
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Now, if you're working a death job on Coruscant, you're usually fine.

1000
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Just saying.

1001
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm not saying that, you know, they're that bad to work for.

1002
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But...

1003
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1004
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
use the passphrase, draw.

1005
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
All right, let's move on with more news

1006
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
because, Loki, I think you have something very related to this, right?

1007
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I mean, I know we're talking about, you know, Origin,

1008
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
but what could they possibly fix with Origin?

1009
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I mean, Origin's perfect, right?

1010
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Uh...

1011
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, what's this?

1012
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Origin has an exploit where you can use hyperlinks to run malicious code?

1013
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
No, that's not good.

1014
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yes, apparently there is a way that, um...

1015
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
What do you mean, run Origin?

1016
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
No, it's not just running Origin, it's Origin Plus.

1017
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Uh, it's...

1018
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
They have this stew...

1019
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And I don't even know why you would need this in the first place,

1020
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
why this is even part of a feature or something,

1021
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
but they have these URI hyperlinks

1022
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
that basically you click on a link on a webpage or something like that,

1023
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
it launches Origin and whatever game, you know, that it's specifying.

1024
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But on top of that, not only can you do that,

1025
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
but you can also have these hyperlinks

1026
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and then have this, like, you know, command parameters and stuff.

1027
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So you can actually have, basically, you change the hyperlink

1028
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
instead of saying, you know, Origin, launch game, blah, blah, blah.

1029
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It'll be Origin, launch game, blah, blah.

1030
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
With this command parameter, I want you to open this, you know,

1031
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
DLL at this IP address.

1032
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Well, that's not good.

1033
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And you're opening, you know, some sort of malicious file

1034
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
on a remotely controlled server.

1035
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Because that's a thing that they have in there.

1036
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And I love their comment on it, though.

1037
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Our team is constantly investigating hypotheticals like this one

1038
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
as we continually update our security infrastructure,

1039
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
considering investigating or constantly investigating.

1040
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
But I don't see a patch for this right now.

1041
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I mean, they know about it.

1042
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Just to say...

1043
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It's being worked on soon, trademark.

1044
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
The best thing you can do is if you have like a web browser

1045
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
or something like that,

1046
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
if you haven't yet clicked on one of these URI links

1047
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
or something like that,

1048
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
one, you know, you get a prompt in like Firefox

1049
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
or something like that that says, you know,

1050
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
use this program to launch this type of file going forward.

1051
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Just have it say, you know, let me choose.

1052
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I mean, how often are you really going to be launching

1053
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
URI links through your web browser?

1054
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Probably not very.

1055
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And then, of course, you know,

1056
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
where they say they're constantly investigating stuff.

1057
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I got a wonder, though, is it...

1058
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Something very similar now with the Play for Free

1059
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
or Battlefield Play for Free.

1060
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Very similar with that is they have another thing.

1061
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It's an exploit for older versions of Windows,

1062
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
anything before Vista,

1063
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
where someone can launch a mod file.

1064
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I guess it's used to customize games and settings.

1065
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And that mod file could queue also some malicious code

1066
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
somewhere else.

1067
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
So very similar, but with a whole different game,

1068
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
not necessarily Origin, but that's not good.

1069
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And I guess they say that it's successful

1070
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
because it overwrites a whitelist

1071
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
that's supposed to restrict sites

1072
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
because of this mod file or like a batch file

1073
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
or something like that.

1074
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yeah, they upload a malicious batch file.

1075
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
They'll execute the next time the computer is restarted.

1076
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I don't know.

1077
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Fun!

1078
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
That's kind of lame.

1079
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I mean, I'll keep your Windows updated, I guess,

1080
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
but not everyone's going to be buying

1081
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Vista.

1082
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
But there are people out there with Windows XP still.

1083
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Who has it better, the people with Windows XP

1084
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
or the people with Windows 8?

1085
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I'm just trolling.

1086
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Windows 8 apparently isn't that bad, really.

1087
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I'm glad I don't have it.

1088
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I had to use it on my wife's sister's laptop

1089
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
to try to like...

1090
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I don't like how everything's arranged in there.

1091
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's very odd.

1092
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
But I mean, I'm sure it's a little bit of a learning curve.

1093
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
But yeah, the regular desktop's there.

1094
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It's just... it's odd.

1095
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I don't know. That's the best way I could describe it.

1096
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Well, I know you play Origin every day, Loki,

1097
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
so you have a lot to be worried about with this.

1098
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
No, I have not installed Origin at all.

1099
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I know I probably have somewhere like an EA account

1100
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
because I did for Burnout Paradise.

1101
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I think it's Paradise.

1102
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
But I have yet to...

1103
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You know whose fault it is I have Origin on PC, right?

1104
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Shane's. Totally Shane's fault.

1105
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Yeah, Shane.

1106
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Didn't you play Burnout Paradise way back in the day?

1107
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Way back in the day, too, though.

1108
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Didn't you play Burnout Paradise way back in the day?

1109
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah, but that was not my PC. It was on Xbox.

1110
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
With oodles and oodles of love,

1111
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
thank you for introducing me to the series.

1112
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Alright, I probably would have had to do it eventually

1113
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
because Alan's a big PC.

1114
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
He doesn't really play stuff on consoles anymore.

1115
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
But anyway, let's talk about better news

1116
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
and things that put a smile on your face

1117
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
as opposed to angry little, you know,

1118
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
slanted eyebrows that indicate an angry face.

1119
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I have a sound for that face.

1120
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yes, face.

1121
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
This is actually really exciting news.

1122
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I was very happy to hear this.

1123
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
The Final Fantasy X HD remaster on PlayStation 3,

1124
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
it's going to include Final Fantasy X-2,

1125
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
which I think is great.

1126
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
That is as reported in Jump Magazine.

1127
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Both games based on the International Edition,

1128
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
and yes, apparently both are getting that HD remaster treatment.

1129
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Because they're both the same engine.

1130
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
The first trailer for Final Fantasy X just hit,

1131
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I think today, so you can actually check that out.

1132
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It looks nice.

1133
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I will definitely be picking this up.

1134
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I love that both these games are on one disc for PlayStation 3.

1135
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Now the Vita, the Vita will be getting both these games,

1136
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
but they have to be purchased separately.

1137
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
However, the games are supposed to come out this year,

1138
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
which is pretty exciting.

1139
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
That'll be fun.

1140
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And yet another reason to not get a PlayStation 4,

1141
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
where there's all this good stuff still coming out on PlayStation 3.

1142
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Maybe I'll actually beat one of them.

1143
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
You know what my problem was?

1144
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I breezed all the way through both of them

1145
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and still wasn't high enough level.

1146
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I didn't really play.

1147
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I mean, I watched you, I think, play some of X-2,

1148
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
and I've certainly seen my fair share of YouTubes.

1149
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I didn't really play a lot of X-2.

1150
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
So I'm kind of, I'd like to give it a fair shot.

1151
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Well, I mean, if you had let me know this,

1152
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I would have just loaned you my copy.

1153
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah.

1154
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Well, I've also got X International.

1155
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So.

1156
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
ActDeftInChat says,

1157
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Final Fantasy X sucks though.

1158
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Wrong.

1159
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Incorrect.

1160
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I see where people take issue to it.

1161
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I do get the issues with it.

1162
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
What can I do for you?

1163
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
But as the game itself, I really like it.

1164
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
That's where every gamer has a voice

1165
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
and everybody gets their own opinion,

1166
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
even when they're wrong.

1167
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
DarkSakura.

1168
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Even when they're being a butt.

1169
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
No, I didn't mean that.

1170
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Only minorly.

1171
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
So here's some good news,

1172
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
and I actually have to thank CatastrophicMaggie

1173
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
for sharing some nice stuff with me.

1174
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
The European Wii U eShop lifted the age restriction

1175
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
that they were having, you know,

1176
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
where you can only buy the games after like,

1177
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
what, nine o'clock?

1178
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Yeah, it was.

1179
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah, you can only buy them after.

1180
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Oh, after eleven.

1181
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
On the Wii U eShop.

1182
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
All night.

1183
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
What was her name?

1184
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Rhonda Shear.

1185
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I still remember that show.

1186
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Rhonda Shear.

1187
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Oh my God.

1188
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You know what?

1189
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
She was hilarious.

1190
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
So I've watched every single Toxic Avenger movie

1191
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
thanks to Rhonda Shear.

1192
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Just saying.

1193
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
But yeah, it had to do with German law.

1194
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Hold on, hold on.

1195
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
This is very important.

1196
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Hi, it's Rhonda, and we'll be watching

1197
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Hats and Surf Nazis Must Die next on USA Up All Night.

1198
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah, it wasn't because of the voice that I remembered that.

1199
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
The 80s hair and the...

1200
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
No, it wasn't the hair.

1201
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It was not the hair.

1202
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Even I have to look at that and go, damn.

1203
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
What's she doing now?

1204
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Now I'm gonna have to Wikipedia.

1205
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Oh, great, Rob.

1206
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Thank you.

1207
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Car shows, I'm sure.

1208
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Rhonda Shear.

1209
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Anyway, so yeah, I think it's really hilarious

1210
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
that we're talking about her and Germany.

1211
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Oh, she died.

1212
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Did she?

1213
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
No, I just made that up.

1214
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Fuck you.

1215
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Okay.

1216
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And you said I couldn't troll people.

1217
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
She's had some surgery too.

1218
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Let's see, her last film that she did in 2003,

1219
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Prison A Go-Go.

1220
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Fun.

1221
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
But let's see, she's been doing Sheer Intimates LLC.

1222
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So she's doing panties basically.

1223
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
In 2010, Rhonda designed the Abra.

1224
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Isn't that a Pokemon?

1225
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Makes sense, yeah.

1226
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Isn't that a Pokemon?

1227
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
What does the Abra do?

1228
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And the product was an overnight success.

1229
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
The Abra is the number one selling bra worldwide.

1230
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
That reads like a sales pitch.

1231
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
She plans to add cosmetic swimwear fragrance

1232
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and boomer hottie into, I think that's,

1233
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
somebody just edited that fucking article.

1234
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I want to know what the Abra is now.

1235
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Charity work, since we're giving her a hard time.

1236
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
In 2011, Rhonda was the event chair and a sponsor

1237
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
for American Cancer Society's Making Strides

1238
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Put On Your Pink Bra event.

1239
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
If I remember correctly from my infomercials,

1240
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
the Abra is a bra that you don't see the bra lines.

1241
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Uh, I just went to look it up.

1242
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Loki?

1243
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Oh, dude, this is things that they sell at the

1244
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
seen on TV store.

1245
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
You guys, Loki knows what an Abra is.

1246
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I watch TV, okay?

1247
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Yes, infomercials.

1248
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I also know what a slap chop is.

1249
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
What is a slap chop?

1250
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
A slap chop is a thing that you can chop garlic in.

1251
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I own one.

1252
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And I had the knockoff brand, it sucked.

1253
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Because the garlic is stuck up in the goddamn thing.

1254
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
USA chop all night.

1255
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Yes.

1256
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Um, so, can I go back to the story that I was trying

1257
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
so professionally to discuss?

1258
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
No, because I'm reading a comment from Marissa

1259
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1260
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Marissa, do you have an Abra?

1261
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Uh, Marissa says,

1262
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Abra is a lazy, saggy bra for wusses.

1263
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Yes, according to their website-

1264
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Well, then again, she has utas brasiers.

1265
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
According to their website, it says,

1266
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Say goodbye to pinching, binding, chafing, and discomfort.

1267
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Prevents bra bulge and underarm cleavage.

1268
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Fits perfectly even if you gain or lose weight.

1269
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It's a chest girdle.

1270
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And it's machine washable.

1271
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Can I get an aw-

1272
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You know what?

1273
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Can I get an aw brief?

1274
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
You know what, first of all?

1275
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
What?

1276
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I have a comfortable bra.

1277
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Just saying.

1278
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And I can wash it in the washing machine!

1279
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It looks like a tank top made out of spandex

1280
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
or something like that.

1281
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
It's like, bulgy boob cups.

1282
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Alright, back to the stuff, video games.

1283
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It's a boob girdle.

1284
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
What gamers really want to know.

1285
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Boobs.

1286
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I don't know, look at our demographic.

1287
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Anyway.

1288
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Um, so yeah.

1289
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Basically they made some, uh,

1290
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I guess they had to have discussed something

1291
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
with the German government

1292
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
or found some loophole to get out of it.

1293
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
But now you can, uh,

1294
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
you can shop for games before 11.

1295
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Now I imagine she's talking about the aw bra.

1296
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
They had to make a deal with the German government

1297
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
in order to be able to sell it.

1298
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
First of all, they had to strike a deal with David Hasselhoff.

1299
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Because he secretly uses the aw bra for his man boobs.

1300
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Awesome.

1301
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm done.

1302
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I'm leaving the room done.

1303
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Bye.

1304
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
God.

1305
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Alright, uh,

1306
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
let's travel around the world and check-

1307
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
But we need to get Marissa to call in

1308
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and do Utz's brassieres now.

1309
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Well, we also have the PAX East calls tonight.

1310
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I have to keep it on topic a little bit,

1311
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
but Marissa's more than welcome to come to episode 500.

1312
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Anyway, uh, release dates.

1313
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Let's travel around the world

1314
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and check out what is coming out in a lingerie store near you.

1315
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Loki.

1316
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Uh, today, uh, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,

1317
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Gates to Infinity, and 3DS,

1318
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
and I believe today was also...

1319
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Luigi's Mansion.

1320
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah, it's Luigi's Mansion.

1321
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I can't remember if that was earlier than today or today.

1322
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Anyways, so there was that.

1323
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And then, of course, next week, also some big stuff.

1324
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Bioshock Infinite on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1325
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Of course, um, Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel

1326
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1327
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,000
WRC-FIA World Rally Championship 2012 on PlayStation 3.

1328
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Uh, Final Fantasy XI,

1329
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
The Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition on Xbox 360

1330
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
on PC and 360.

1331
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Final Fantasy XI, Seekers of Alduin.

1332
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Um, Tiger Woods, PGA Tour 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1333
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Also, the Master's Historic Edition

1334
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
if you really want to spend extra money for a few extra courses.

1335
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And...

1336
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I believe that's it.

1337
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Let's go to Japan and check out the release dates over there.

1338
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
On the PlayStation 3 on March 28th,

1339
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel comes out on PlayStation 3,

1340
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
as well as Sengoku Basara Triple Pack.

1341
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I am assuming that is all three games in the, uh,

1342
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
it's Sengoku Basara 3, Utage, and HD Collection

1343
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
are all the games that are that.

1344
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Uh, what series is this? Is this...

1345
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
That would be Three Kingdoms, Sengoku...

1346
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Sengoku Basara is Devil Kings over here.

1347
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Thank you. I was like, I know it's over here, but it's...

1348
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's the Capcom Fantasy Warriors game.

1349
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
It's a little more, like, cultish over here, I guess, for lack of a better term.

1350
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
They don't release any over here, that's why.

1351
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I thought, no, they have Devil Kings.

1352
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
They had Devil Kings on PlayStation 2,

1353
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and then they had Sengoku Basara on the Wii,

1354
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
and PlayStation 3, like, a couple years ago.

1355
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Uh, the Final Fantasy XI expansion makes its way to Japan as well,

1356
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
and the Xbox 360, for all you guys playing it on the 360 in Japan.

1357
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Uh, as well as Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel,

1358
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Cave Shooting Collection, that ought to be pretty good,

1359
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
and Love Torre Chocolate.

1360
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And the Cave Shooting Collection, by the way,

1361
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
since it is a Cave title, I believe those are region-free.

1362
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Nice.

1363
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
What, is that something that might come to the store, then?

1364
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Um, I'm sure that...

1365
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Some of them hit the, uh, direct download.

1366
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Well, Cave, the Shooting Collection,

1367
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I mean, all the Cave titles have been out on Xbox Live Arcade.

1368
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Okay.

1369
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I want to say that it's, um...

1370
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Probably...

1371
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
They probably will bring it over here.

1372
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Axis Games might bring it over.

1373
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Axis or... Yeah.

1374
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Yeah, it would be Axis Games, I think. They would be the ones.

1375
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
By the way, I looked up Basara.

1376
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
It means crazy or over-the-top, but also stylish.

1377
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Better than Basura in Spanish.

1378
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
What does that mean? Junk? Trash?

1379
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Trash, yeah.

1380
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Alright, uh, PlayStation Vita this week in Japan.

1381
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
On the 28th, Oboro Muramasa comes out this week from Marvelous Entertainment.

1382
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
It has to do with a sword.

1383
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Muramasa Rebirth, the remake.

1384
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Seimadu Monogatari comes out as well from Compile.

1385
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Compile! Yay!

1386
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Who needs to remake the Guardian Legend somehow.

1387
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Cotton!

1388
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Alright.

1389
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
And Guardian Legend.

1390
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Yes.

1391
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Lastly, but not leastly, on the 3DS this week,

1392
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Nano Assault gets a price reduction,

1393
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:02,000
and Shoshinsha Kata Nai Honnichi Made Soroban Anzan Flash Anzan.

1394
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That's a mouthful. What game is this?

1395
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Duff.

1396
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
No pictures of it, but the related games are all, like...

1397
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Puppies.

1398
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Puppies and Kitty Cafe and things like that,

1399
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
so it's one of those games.

1400
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Alright, how about the UK? Dark Sakura?

1401
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Some stuff.

1402
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
In the UK, we have, starting with the 26th, we have Bioshock Infinite.

1403
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
On the 27th, Lego City Undercover and Sly Cooper Thieves in Time.

1404
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
The 28th, we have Luigi's Mansion 2 and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14.

1405
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
And on the 29th, we have Army of Four.

1406
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
That's it.

1407
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
There you go. Just a couple more news stories for you guys,

1408
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and then the classic game of the week.

1409
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
But first, Loki.

1410
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Now, even though War Z may try to convince you that they were part of this program,

1411
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
they actually don't have this program out yet, or they just started it.

1412
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It's the early access program.

1413
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,000
It allows you to play and purchase games that are still in development.

1414
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
They have a few games, starting off with Arma 3 and Star Forge.

1415
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Also, a game I think should be at least a nominee for the best title of a game in 2013,

1416
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Drunken Robot Pornography.

1417
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Sign me up.

1418
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I mean, that sounds awesome.

1419
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yes, and then, let's see, was it Kenshi?

1420
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Kenshi, an open-ended squad-based strategy RPG.

1421
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
That's too big of a subtitle.

1422
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

1423
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
You're going to have to change that.

1424
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Basically, so, yeah.

1425
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
They're going to add features, and stuff will be available over time.

1426
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Plus, I guess you'll be able to maybe provide some feedback for the titles.

1427
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
But that's kind of cool that you can do that.

1428
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Arma 3, I actually kind of want to try that, but Arma's so simulation

1429
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
that I just would want to mod the hell out of it, you know,

1430
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
get laser beams and stuff.

1431
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
That'd be ridiculous.

1432
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I kind of like that whole idea about getting in early on the game's development

1433
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
and kind of getting to give that instant feedback,

1434
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
and maybe your angry internet comments really can influence the game.

1435
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Yeah.

1436
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Kind of neat.

1437
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Especially in this Kickstarter world we live in now,

1438
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
this seems like a great place to launch a project that started on Kickstarter

1439
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
where your investors, essentially, really can have their say on the game's development.

1440
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
There is one I saw.

1441
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
It wasn't Kickstarter.

1442
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
It was another.

1443
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I don't know if they were doing it through their own website.

1444
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
No.

1445
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It was, actually, it was a train simulation game.

1446
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
But the difference was is they were asking people to crowdfund it,

1447
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
but the people that crowdfunded it also get a portion of the profits

1448
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
that they receive from the game.

1449
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
So you're profit sharing, I guess, which is kind of cool.

1450
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
That'd be kind of neat to do with Kickstarter.

1451
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Hmm.

1452
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I might have missed it.

1453
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Are there any games you're looking forward to being a part of with this?

1454
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
No.

1455
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Not right now.

1456
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I mean, Arma 3 looks kind of cool.

1457
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I may have to check out robot, you know, the robot pornography game

1458
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
because that's an awesome title, and I like giant robot games,

1459
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
so it'd be interesting to check out.

1460
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
It'd be interesting to check out.

1461
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
All right.

1462
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Well, one more story for you guys, and I alluded to this earlier

1463
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
when we were talking about DuckTales,

1464
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
but there was some talk about Mega Man at PAX East

1465
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
at the World of Capcom panel.

1466
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Brett Elston, the Capcom community manager,

1467
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
said that Capcom is developing a new game in the Mega Man series,

1468
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
but they're not ready to fully announce it just yet.

1469
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I think this is kind of a duh.

1470
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I mean, despite the canceled projects,

1471
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I mean, like, would you really just drop something like Mega Man?

1472
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
No, I think you put it to bed for a few years,

1473
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
and then it comes back better than ever, right?

1474
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
That's probably what's happening here.

1475
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
However, since this story first broke on the internet,

1476
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Capcom kind of came behind the community manager here and said,

1477
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
now, now, now, now, no Mega Man game has been confirmed.

1478
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
The company is having ongoing discussions about Mega Man,

1479
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
but it won't announce anything until something is ready.

1480
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So don't hold your breath that that's necessarily this year.

1481
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
It could be a long time.

1482
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Now, Shane was sending me some private messages

1483
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
when we were talking about the whole DuckTales and WayForward thing

1484
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
and saying, what else should WayForward do?

1485
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And Shane was reminding me, Rob, WayForward doesn't always strike gold.

1486
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Let's pull up WayForward's resume

1487
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and see some of the other games that they've done in the past.

1488
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Godzilla Domination on the Game Boy Advance,

1489
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
SpongeBob SquarePants Lights Camera Pants,

1490
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
the A Boy and His Blob on the Wii,

1491
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
although, to be fair, I never really gave that a try,

1492
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
so I don't know how.

1493
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I really wanted to play that too because I love the first one.

1494
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Let's see, the Silent Hill Book of Memories game on the Vita,

1495
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
but see, Shane didn't like that.

1496
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I didn't think it was terrible.

1497
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I just didn't think it was great, but it's decent.

1498
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
It wasn't very Silent Hilly, was it?

1499
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
But here, here's the biggest sin WayForward has ever committed.

1500
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
You ready for this?

1501
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
A Nintendo DS game called Ping Pals.

1502
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Oh.

1503
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Do you remember this game?

1504
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Yes.

1505
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I didn't play it, but I remember.

1506
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
It was like somebody put out PictoChat as a game.

1507
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
But how long ago was that?

1508
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
2004, glad you asked.

1509
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I mean, think about it.

1510
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
They've done their time.

1511
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
They did their time in jail.

1512
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
They've learned their lesson.

1513
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
They made some bad mistakes as kids, and now they're adults.

1514
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Do I have Queen's We Are the Champions going through my head?

1515
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Okay, let's look at their more recent resume.

1516
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
So there's Silent Hill Book of Memories, the Adventure Time game,

1517
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Hey Ice King, Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?

1518
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Yeah, that was fantastic.

1519
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Mighty Switch Force Hyperdrive Edition, which was actually pretty good.

1520
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Double Dragon Neon, which was great.

1521
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Blood Rain Betrayal.

1522
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Considering the source material, yeah.

1523
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And Shantae, I keep wanting to say Shantae.

1524
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Shantae, you stay.

1525
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Shantae, Risky's Revenge.

1526
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That's supposed to be pretty good.

1527
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Okay, so they made a few mistakes as kids.

1528
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I did want to mention, because I do happen to follow them on Facebook,

1529
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
the 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3,

1530
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:20,000
They did post a wonderful update regarding a fan-made game in the Mega Man series.

1531
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It's called The Master System.

1532
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It's an action brawler game based in the Mega Man Legends series.

1533
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
They have two unique characters, and you fight a bunch of the Reaverbots.

1534
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And you can check it out for free right now.

1535
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:43,000
It's arcade.legends-station.com?sp equals Master System.

1536
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
So check it out, or follow the 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3,

1537
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
which they are now 101,000 strong.

1538
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Just saying.

1539
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
101,000.

1540
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Tigerclaw in chat linking us to some Ping Pals gameplay.

1541
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Check that out.

1542
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Where you have an actual little keyboard you can type on, or you can draw,

1543
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
and you have coins to buy stuff for your avatar.

1544
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
But here's the thing with Ping Pals, man.

1545
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Can you imagine? Remember there was that Boyfriend Simulator game

1546
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
that had the really fucked up chatbot engine that was in there?

1547
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It will say some weird shit to you.

1548
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
If they re-released that game with that in there, that could actually be entertaining.

1549
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Here's the thing about Ping Pals.

1550
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Just trying to cut this game a little slack.

1551
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
What if, when this game started development,

1552
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
they didn't know that Nintendo was going to put PictoChat into the system?

1553
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
What if there had been no PictoChat?

1554
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Would we be giving Ping Pals such shit?

1555
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I think we might still be a little bit less.

1556
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
A little bit less.

1557
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
But a little bit less, yeah.

1558
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I don't think we'd remember it quite as horrifically as we do, because...

1559
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
It wouldn't seem as ridiculous.

1560
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah.

1561
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Alright, well, let's go back to a much simpler time.

1562
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Let's go back before WayForward and all this stuff, before even Ping Pals.

1563
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
We're going to go back to a much simpler time in a segment we call

1564
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
The Classic Game of the Week,

1565
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
where Dark Soccer is going to walk into the gaming vault

1566
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
and find a game that she thinks,

1567
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Hey, you kids and your frickin' HD reboots.

1568
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
In this case it's, Hey, I can't believe I haven't done this one yet.

1569
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Go play this pixelated classic and love it.

1570
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1571
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Eternal Champions.

1572
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
How have I never done this?

1573
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
You say that every week. How have I never done this?

1574
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I was sitting down trying to go through all of the...

1575
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Oh, fuck.

1576
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I hate...

1577
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Do your... Read your thing.

1578
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Anyway, so anyway, Eternal Champions came out in 1993.

1579
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:48,000
It was a 2D fighting game, and they came out for the Mega Drive or Sega Genesis that same year.

1580
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And it was sort of like a Mortal Kombat-y type of thing,

1581
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,000
where there were over-kills and special moves and things.

1582
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But it did spawn like one of the best sequels ever,

1583
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
which was Eternal Champions Challenge for the Dark Side,

1584
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
which was basically the Sega CD version.

1585
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And two other spin-offs, there was a...

1586
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
It's just set in that universe,

1587
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
and it's also out on the Wii Virtual Console account in 2007.

1588
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
So basically, it's just this typical fighting game.

1589
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I mean, it works a lot like Street Fighter II.

1590
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
It uses the six-button controller, though, so that you can have the different ones.

1591
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
And the version of this that I have, I got with Sega Activator.

1592
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Do you remember the Activator?

1593
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Oh, he had one of those Activators.

1594
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
He was trying to build a Para Para machine out of it.

1595
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Yeah, I think I threw it away.

1596
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'm gonna tell you how we got our Activator.

1597
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Right before Virgin went out of business, we bought it for eight bucks.

1598
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
A Genesis Activator.

1599
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So that's how we have our copy.

1600
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
When was that long ago when Virgin Megastore went out of business?

1601
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
It was very soon after I moved out here.

1602
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Wow, okay.

1603
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Longer than ten years ago.

1604
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I guess you're right. It seems like that wasn't that long ago.

1605
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Of course I'm right. It's me.

1606
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
So basically, you block by holding away.

1607
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Like I said, very Street Fighter, you don't have an actual block button.

1608
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
But if you get hit several times in a row, you get dizzy, and then your opponent gets a free attack.

1609
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Blah, blah, blah. The usual stuff.

1610
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:26,000
You also had a special attack meter, so that you could do different specials.

1611
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
And then you had your overkills.

1612
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And that was stage specific.

1613
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I'm getting tongue tied today.

1614
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,000
These are basically, you have to defeat your opponent where they fall in a certain area of the ground.

1615
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
If they land in the right spot, the life bars disappear.

1616
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And something in the background kills them to death.

1617
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Like for example...

1618
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Wow, this person just got set on fire.

1619
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Yeah.

1620
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Awesome.

1621
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
If you're, you can get vaporized by neon sign and shadows level.

1622
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
A Tyrannosaurus can kill you and slash a level.

1623
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Good lord, that goes on forever.

1624
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Not only did the guy get set on fire, but then you see a skeleton, and then the head falls off the skeleton.

1625
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Like...

1626
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Yeah.

1627
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Ew.

1628
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
There's a drive by shooting in Larsen's level.

1629
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
And a napalm bomb in Midnight's level.

1630
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:23,000
So yeah, there were a bunch of characters, and I'm gonna go through the character list real quick.

1631
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Just because some of them had some fun names.

1632
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
And there were some of the, I thought some of the better characters were in the second one.

1633
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:36,000
But you had Shadow Miyamoto, Rax Coswell, Jonathan Blade, Jetta Max.

1634
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Slash Trident, Xavier Pendragon, Mitchell Middleton Knight, who was Midnight.

1635
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Haha, with a K.

1636
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Larsen Tyler, the Eternal Champion.

1637
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
You had Chin Wo, Dawson McShane, who was kind of fun.

1638
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Ramses the Third, Raven Gendar, Senator, and Riptide De Medici.

1639
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
People love to hate on those De Medicis, I swear, but they were all busy killing each other and being Pope.

1640
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Then you had Blast Chavez, and then some animals.

1641
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
This game looks kind of derpy though.

1642
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
It is kind of derpy, but it was classic.

1643
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Fair enough, fair enough.

1644
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Classically derpy.

1645
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
There was the Slurpee flavor that was Sega Eternal Champions Cherry.

1646
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And it was at 7-Eleven, of course.

1647
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Then there were game books that came out that were released by Puffin Books.

1648
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:34,000
There was a comic about this that was called Eternal Champions Special that was done by the UK Sega Magazine, Sonic the Comic.

1649
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Do you remember the group Bone Thugs and Harmony?

1650
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Yes, I do.

1651
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:51,000
They basically sampled Eternal Champions for their songs Eternal and Crossroad.

1652
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Really? Crossroad samples Eternal Champions? That was like their biggest hit.

1653
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And Courage the Cowardly Dog also used some of the same audio loops from the game.

1654
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:10,000
EGM actually sponsored Eternal Champions tournaments, which I remember a few people...

1655
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I think I knew one person who actually was in one of those a while back, but don't quote me on that.

1656
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And then, like I said, it came with the Activator.

1657
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,000
There is a special moves edition that was a handheld tiger game.

1658
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It basically was just a really crappy version of Eternal Champions.

1659
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And basically it was a pretty mediocre game.

1660
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I mean, I thought that the Sega CD one was better.

1661
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And then they were going to do Eternal Champions the Final Chapter for the Saturn, but they cancelled it so that they could push Virtua Fighter in the US.

1662
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I would like to know if there is a prototype of this sitting around because I would love to see it.

1663
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
So yeah, as far as the spin-offs, there was one called Chicago Syndicate.

1664
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:06,000
It came out on the Game Gear in 1995 that was based on an alternate reality where Lars and Tyler didn't die in 1920.

1665
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And then there's Expert X-PERTS.

1666
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:16,000
There's a side-scrolling beat-em-up that is based on one where Shadow Yamato didn't die.

1667
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
So, yeah.

1668
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Eternal Champions.

1669
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Overkill.

1670
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I think this one you get eaten by a shark.

1671
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Yeah, I'm waiting to see if they get to the...

1672
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
They keep pausing it, so I'm assuming they're looking up the fatality or whatever.

1673
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Or whatever is followed in this game.

1674
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Overkill.

1675
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
What was the game that had the ones that were called Cinekills?

1676
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Do you remember that one?

1677
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
There was a game that called it that and I don't remember what it is.

1678
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Was it Time Killers?

1679
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Maybe it was Time Killer. Hold on, I'll find out.

1680
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Time Killer was the one where you chopped off the body parts. It was funny.

1681
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Alright, there it is. Your classic Game of the Week Eternal Champions for the Mega Drive.

1682
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,000
They were Cinekills in Eternal Champion CD is what they were.

1683
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
That's what it was.

1684
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I knew it was one of them.

1685
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Alright, we are going to take a quick break and then we'll be back with more Orange Laundry tonight.

1686
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
We have a not-so-serious Fugu Question of the Week tonight that should be fun.

1687
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
A little more news out of PAX East. Hopefully some calls, we're hoping.

1688
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
And, yes, Jamie's going to talk a little more about Mass Effect.

1689
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
But don't worry guys, not too much.

1690
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Hey!

1691
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
All that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1692
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1693
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Live on this Sunday evening, March the 24th, 2013.

1694
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Episode number 498 of our program in progress.

1695
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Hello to those of you guys.

1696
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Apparently we've got a few folks, I've been messaging IRC and just got some text messages,

1697
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
that are listening to us in the car on the way back from PAX East.

1698
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
So, hello you lucky shits.

1699
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Drive safely.

1700
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
No, drive recklessly. Faster, faster. I'm kidding. Please drive safe.

1701
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Don't be driving drunk either.

1702
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Dark Sakura will kick your ass.

1703
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Alright, let's get back into some rapid fire news.

1704
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Rob, there are things that are more painful to kick than the ass.

1705
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Dark Sakura will kick you in the taint, or the ah-bra.

1706
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
She will snap your ah-bra.

1707
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I will cut a bitch.

1708
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Alright.

1709
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And she'll say, you mad bra?

1710
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Rapid fire news time, Loki.

1711
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And there's things locally I wish I could buy.

1712
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Borderlands 2, they're teasing a while back, South by Southwest,

1713
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
that there is going to be a brand new character class.

1714
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Well, PAX East, they finally revealed what that's going to be.

1715
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:50,000
It is Krieg the Psycho, or Krieg the, I guess, I don't know what you call it,

1716
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
the Reformed Psycho.

1717
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
He's basically a psycho from the game.

1718
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:01,000
His primary form of attack is melee, which sounds lame actually when you think about it,

1719
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
because this is a game about guns,

1720
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
and also because the character I've been actually playing as Zero has a melee attack,

1721
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and I fucking hate using it, because I thought it cool.

1722
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I'm like, hey, cool, I have a samurai sword, I'm going to chop through people.

1723
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
No, I just shoot them in the head and kill them.

1724
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And of course also there's going to be an Ultimate Vault Hunter upgrade pack on April 2nd.

1725
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It's going to raise the game's level cap from 50 to 61.

1726
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Not 60, but 61.

1727
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That's so much bigger.

1728
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And I guess the upgrade pack will be part of the season pass, so that's cool.

1729
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
The psycho pack will not be part of the season pass content.

1730
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And also I guess the upgrade pack is going to have the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode,

1731
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
which of course will raise the level caps of all the enemies in the third playthrough.

1732
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
And of course the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, that's going to be,

1733
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
if you don't have the season pass, five bucks for 400 Microsoft points.

1734
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Also the psycho pack is 999 or 800 Microsoft points.

1735
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
That's coming in May at some point.

1736
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And last piece of DLC I guess is coming out in June, and that's going to be part of the campaign.

1737
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Let's see here.

1738
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Now I'm laughing because I just got a text from Bobby Blackwolf saying,

1739
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I'm driving recklessly.

1740
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Yell at Bobby Thar, Sakura. Yell at him.

1741
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Ehh!

1742
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Fi! Fi!

1743
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
That's my new word by the way.

1744
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
No, we haven't done anything worthy of cancellation tonight.

1745
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Yet.

1746
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
In this half of the show.

1747
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Alright. Sorry, Loki.

1748
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Dust and Lesion Tales coming to Steam.

1749
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
And nowhere to win, but it is coming.

1750
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:02,000
They're going to be, I guess, not going to be doing a whole lot different than the other versions.

1751
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
But at least it'll look nice if I didn't see them.

1752
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And then the thing I want to know, is anyone going to fucking buy this game?

1753
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Because I kind of want to buy this game, but I want people to play with it.

1754
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
No one answered me on Twitter, so fuck them.

1755
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I'm sure that they had more important things to do.

1756
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Wait, I think that was actually before PAX, so fuck you guys for not responding back in the first place.

1757
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And I bet if you ask on Tumblr, you'll just get a bunch of likes and no answers.

1758
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Yeah. So, but yes. Duke Nukem 3D has come out on Steam as part of this Megaton edition.

1759
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:42,000
It's basically Duke Nukem kind of remastered with all the, basically, you know, I knew that they had expansion packs, but I never knew anything was actually kind of official.

1760
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I thought it was just kind of this third, like a company making like a skin or something and selling it.

1761
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Yeah, I always thought it was a bunch of homegrown shit.

1762
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
But apparently it was official stuff.

1763
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Wait, but I have the actual Duke Nukem 3D Mega Edition CD-ROM. I can't just use that. I have to get the Steam version so I can play through Steam, right?

1764
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I think so, yeah.

1765
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Bitches. How much is it?

1766
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Ten dollars.

1767
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
You know, I may have to do this. I'm tempted.

1768
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It's Duke Nukem 3D, the Atomic Edition, so you got your four campaigns right there.

1769
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Plus the three bundled expansions, Duke's Caribbean, Life is a Beach, Duke, Nuclear Winter, and Duke it Out in DC.

1770
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:23,000
And I guess, you know, the PC and Mac, and they're the OpenGL versions of the game.

1771
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Duke Nukem's in our chat right now. Well, hail to the king, baby!

1772
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Saying, I used to have the Kiloton collection. That was official, I believe. That's the one we have.

1773
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Actually, Alan has it, and I just stole it.

1774
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Well, I got to Duke Nukem 3D when they were doing that thing with, was it, Good Ol' Games a while back, so I got that.

1775
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:46,000
But they're going to add online multiplayer later on, I guess, via Steamworks and Linux support.

1776
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
What? It doesn't have it right now?

1777
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
No.

1778
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Then why would I buy it?

1779
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Instant gratification.

1780
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I don't care about that. I want, here's what I want, as part of, you know, Steamworks, I want custom app supports.

1781
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Because, man, I used to make Duke Nukem apps all day long, man.

1782
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,000
That was, I had one, I love this story.

1783
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I had one where it was basically a water park, or water slide. It was just the moving water, and you would kind of go along with it and move really fast.

1784
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And there was a drop, because you take no fall damage, you fall in water.

1785
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
So, the drop was done with holding page down, it would lower the floor.

1786
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I put a paperweight on page down and went and had lunch, and it came back later on.

1787
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
That drop was five minutes long!

1788
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
It was great!

1789
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
But then how do you get back up to the top?

1790
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Super fast elevator. And if you hit the super fast elevator the wrong way, it will cause you to explode. But, it was awesome.

1791
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I'm only interested in this when it gets online multiplayer. I can't believe you set this whole thing up and you can't play it.

1792
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Like, why would I buy it right now?

1793
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I forgot, okay? Because I haven't bought it yet.

1794
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
But you should buy it here. This is Duke Nukem.

1795
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I'll buy it when it's online multiplayer.

1796
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Yeah, exactly. Maybe we should wait until Steam Sale comes.

1797
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Yeah, I was going to say, and it'll be, the summer Steam Sale gets here, it'll be like $350.

1798
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Excited.

1799
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Well, I mean, in the meantime, Gary's Mod, $3.

1800
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
They should just give it to anybody who bought Duke Nukem Forever.

1801
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Right? Like an apology?

1802
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
We're sorry, here.

1803
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Like the SimCity thing.

1804
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Or like boob wall mode.

1805
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Alright, meanwhile, here's what I'll be playing on Steam.

1806
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Civilization V, a great Steam game. Another expansion coming out.

1807
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I was not expecting this, but Civ V Brave New World is the next expansion.

1808
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
It will be launching in July.

1809
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I didn't catch everything that's supposed to be in this game,

1810
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
but apparently one of the things they're adding are units from XCOM squads,

1811
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
which is a little silly, but okay, it can work.

1812
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
There are going to be paratroopers who drop in 40 units away,

1813
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
as opposed to 9 units away.

1814
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
So, alright, I can kind of see why they're doing that.

1815
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
But I kind of missed what else was supposed to be big about this expansion.

1816
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Damn, there's not even the video of the XCOM units there anymore.

1817
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
But, alright, if it's a Civ V expansion, I'm going to get it anyway.

1818
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I will buy that just as fast as Dark Tetsuya will be buying this next game.

1819
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
It's La Mulana, which has a launch date now for Steam.

1820
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It's April 15th, just in time.

1821
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
File your taxes, and then play an even greater enemy in La Mulana.

1822
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Or someone can get it for me for my birthday.

1823
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Perhaps, but your birthday isn't yet.

1824
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Not on April 15th.

1825
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
It isn't yet, but it's that week.

1826
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
But your birthday is a two-week celebration, correct?

1827
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
My birthday is a fucking month celebration. What are you talking about?

1828
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
It's a holiday in my universe.

1829
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
So, anyhow, La Mulana is going to be on Steam on April 15th.

1830
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
It's the remake of La Mulana, they say.

1831
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Anyhow, it'll be $15, but if you pre-order, you get a whole 10% off.

1832
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
That's $13.50, y'all.

1833
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:51,000
This is the version that's based on the WiiWare game, which took forever to come out.

1834
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
But the Steam version will have the WiiWare DLC, Hell Temple.

1835
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Because, you know, the game wasn't hard enough.

1836
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:03,000
You can plug in a USB controller, like your Xbox 360 controller, and the controller away.

1837
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Interesting comment this week from some of the folks behind Super Meat Boy.

1838
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Tommy Refens, talking about DRM in the wake of all the SimCity hubble blue going on.

1839
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Saying that basically DRM is how developers shoot themselves in the foot.

1840
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Companies try to combat piracy of their software with DRM, but if loss due to pirated software is not calculable to an accurate amount,

1841
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
does the implementation of DRM provide a return on investment?

1842
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
It is impossible to say yes to this statement.

1843
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:39,000
The reality of our current software age is the internet is more efficient at breaking things than companies are at creating them.

1844
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
A company will spend massive amounts of money on DRM and the internet will break it in a matter of days in most cases.

1845
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
When the DRM is broken, is it worth the money spent to implement it?

1846
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Did the week of unbroken DRM for your game gain you any sales from potential pirates due to the inability to pirate at launch?

1847
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Again, there's no way of telling, and as such, cannot be used as an accurate justification for spending money.

1848
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Now, hold on though.

1849
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:11,000
As much as you want to go, yeah, DRM sucks, and I do think overdoing DRM is pretty bad.

1850
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:17,000
The Steam DRM doesn't annoy me, but some of these DRMs that we've heard about in the past where you get knocked offline and so forth,

1851
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:23,000
that stuff annoys me. And the SimCity stuff, for me, that was really never an issue with the DRM.

1852
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I didn't really care. Just the fact that you had to play SimCity through Origin, I knew it was going to be bad.

1853
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
But some folks are playing it and enjoying it, so you know what, more power to you.

1854
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I'm having fun with my games, you have fun with yours.

1855
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
But here's the thing about this whole comment.

1856
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Did the week of unbroken DRM for your game gain you any sales from potential pirates?

1857
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:51,000
See, I would argue maybe, because the most critical time for new game sales is that first week.

1858
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:58,000
So yeah, if a copy protection or whatever scheme can hold things off for a week, then yeah, actually it might be worth it.

1859
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
But at what price?

1860
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And that's the problem I have, is that when that DRM starts to step on the toes of the legitimate player, that's when I have a problem with it.

1861
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And when you have a game like SimCity where the DRM is really bad, as far as the launch week was all messed up,

1862
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
you may have people that are just like, you know what, I'm just not going to pirate that game.

1863
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Because I don't want to play it.

1864
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And also, the next game that someone put out, they just may not care anymore.

1865
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
They say, I had such a bad experience with this, I'm not going to buy this game.

1866
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I'm kind of done dumping on SimCity. There's just a million other games right now that are worthy of my time that I'll play instead.

1867
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Like The Walking Dead. The intro video. I kid you not, and you can even see this in the reviews.

1868
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Yeah, I saw the video. That was bad. The mouse is still there.

1869
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
The mouse pointer.

1870
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
That's bad.

1871
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Really? Really? Come on. That just says, I'm bragging about how little effort I put into this game. That's what that says.

1872
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And it's so sad that there's like, there's bad walking dead and there's good walking dead.

1873
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And the bad walking dead, people bought a lot, I'm sure a lot of people bought a lot of because,

1874
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
or stores brought in copies of because the last one did really well.

1875
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Not knowing that the two have nothing in common except that they're based loosely on the same thing,

1876
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
even though the good ones from the comics and the bad ones from the TV show, right?

1877
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Yeah.

1878
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
That's unfortunate.

1879
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:41,000
ActDeft in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says, everyone should play The Walking Dead. The telltale game, of course.

1880
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Dungeon Buster speaking about SimCity in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says, it has other issues outside of the always online thing.

1881
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Let's watch the broken traffic go in circles. I find the whole limited space, extremely limited space for the city kind of interesting.

1882
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Now, granted, the old SimCity games had that too.

1883
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:09,000
But the fact that people have broken it so that you can go outside those lines is really curious to me.

1884
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:17,000
But again, I had no interest in SimCity before. I really don't now. Let's move on.

1885
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I like a nap instead of SimCity. That sounds better.

1886
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
No nap. Stories.

1887
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Eh. Rap.

1888
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
This is supposedly rapid fire news that's been going on for 20 minutes now.

1889
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I know, right?

1890
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Speaking of The Walking Dead, by the way, it's supposed to be coming out on Vita, the telltale version, that is, as in the good one.

1891
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:41,000
So you can play it on the Vita. They don't know when, or if it's even going to be episodic or if it's going to be all at once.

1892
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
But it'll be there, so they say.

1893
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
There's also the Indie Springs sale going on Steam right now.

1894
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Which, Rob, like I told you earlier, you need to get to the moon.

1895
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Everybody who is listening to my voice, get to the moon.

1896
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I even was considering getting Dark Souls Prepare to Die, because it was half off too.

1897
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I also picked up DLC Quest. I forgot to mention. I didn't play it, but I picked it up. It was like three packs.

1898
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I need to get that.

1899
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Incredibly short.

1900
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
About an hour worth of your time.

1901
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
For three bucks.

1902
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Three bucks, that's not a waste.

1903
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
There's a lot worse things I could spend for an hour of my time.

1904
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:30,000
There's also Runner 2, Future Legend of the Rhythm Alien, Super Hexagon, Proteus, Retro City Rampage, and VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV

1905
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I'm just gonna call it VVVVVVVVVVVVV

1906
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Which is a flipping great game, but everybody should've got it in that bundle.

1907
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Ah ha!

1908
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
A flipping great game.

1909
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Home in Jamestown, and Kentucky Route Zero.

1910
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
To the Moon, though, I am in love with that game.

1911
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I'm playing it very slowly on purpose.

1912
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
To the Moon, Jamie! To the Moon!

1913
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I'm basically playing a level a week so that I can sort of draw out the game.

1914
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Because it's really, I really think it's adorable.

1915
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
As I mentioned, Gary's mod for three bucks.

1916
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And Diablo 3 is supposed to be on consoles, but not necessarily exclusive to the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4.

1917
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It has been confirmed for both, but they're not saying that that's the only place it's gonna be.

1918
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Can you imagine if they brought it to the Vita?

1919
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
That'd be pretty sweet.

1920
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
That'd be cool.

1921
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Leaving the door open, though, for the Xbox 360 and the Wii U.

1922
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I could see the Wii U.

1923
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I want unicorns and ponies edition.

1924
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
There's nothing but that map.

1925
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
You need to go to Whimsieville or whatever it's called.

1926
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Yeah, they need to have the Whimsieville edition.

1927
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
There's nothing but Whimsieville quests.

1928
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Whimsieville's kinda hard, actually, but...

1929
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Isn't it Whimsie Shire or something?

1930
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Who cares?

1931
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Ponies and unicorns.

1932
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
And fairies and rainbows and barf.

1933
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Specific, specific, specifics.

1934
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
CatastrophicMoggie in our chat room wants to know, are you excited for the To the Moon sequel?

1935
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Yes!

1936
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Called To the Venus.

1937
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
No, I just made that up.

1938
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
To the Butt.

1939
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
No, I will be excited when I finish To the Moon.

1940
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Alright, that does it for rapid fire news tonight, so let's go to our FUGL question of the week.

1941
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
It's very awkward.

1942
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
We ask a question on Facebook and a question on Google.

1943
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
We collect your responses.

1944
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
You slam Facebook and Google together, you get Google.

1945
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
And this week, you guys, not a serious question.

1946
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
We decided to have a little fun with it this week.

1947
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
In the spirit of PAX East and our upcoming 500th episode,

1948
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:37,000
a lot of you have joked in the past that you'd like to see a VOGCON or some type of IRL event.

1949
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
What would a VOGCON or your dream convention consist of?

1950
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
So we're talking about people's dream conventions.

1951
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
GamerGirl on Facebook starting us off saying,

1952
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I think it would consist of DDR event in house, whoever's it would be at, pizza, Mass Effect, and Pinkberry.

1953
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
That's just a Friday night at Jamie's. What are you talking about?

1954
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Actually, that literally is a Friday night at my house.

1955
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Because that's exactly what I was doing.

1956
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
VOGCON is suddenly she comes to slumber party at Jamie's.

1957
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
That would be fun.

1958
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Haseo Tsumuragawa says, VOGCON should have Loki in the Tingle costume. Just saying.

1959
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Just get over it. I mean, seriously.

1960
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,000
If you really want it to happen, Eye of Judgment would have worked. It just didn't, okay?

1961
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
You know what, you should actually, you just should wear your Sackboy outfit.

1962
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I should have made that same bet with, you know, the frickin' wonder books.

1963
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
That thing flopped almost faster than.

1964
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
You should have made the same bet with the Wii U.

1965
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Oh, alright. Moving on.

1966
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
That did still mill and copy, so.

1967
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Well then yes, you should have made the same bet with the Wii U.

1968
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
In January, no.

1969
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Alright, AZHP responds and says, as someone who goes to conventions.

1970
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Don't we all go to conventions at some point?

1971
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Alright, as someone who goes to conventions, I don't really care what actually happens at the event.

1972
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
As long as there are cool people to hang out with.

1973
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Which basically means that a VOGCON would automatically be the second best convention ever behind Fanime.

1974
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Let's be honest, guys. Fair enough.

1975
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I like Fanime.

1976
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:12,000
James S. replies and says, alls I know is if Dan and Dark Sakura are in the same building,

1977
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
they're not allowed to fight or bicker at one another at all.

1978
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Just kidding. Love you guys.

1979
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I lolled.

1980
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Dark Tetsuya said, I think each show on the network should be represented with a different event.

1981
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Like for us, I'm assuming meaning OLR, it would have to be either a classic game or a music game competition.

1982
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Celebrating both our roots and video game's roots in general.

1983
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I think we'd have to do the music game and let Bobby have the classic game.

1984
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Because he, you know, I can't remember his tag on off the top of my head.

1985
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
But you know, he talks about gaming's history and all that.

1986
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Fabrice A. replies and says, Dan should host a DDR tournament called Dan's Central.

1987
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
He would, you know what Dan's reply to that would be?

1988
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Dan's Central.

1989
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
He'd make his gorilla face and go, really?

1990
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
That got a like from Tiara, essentially. She replied and said seconded, essentially.

1991
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
She would.

1992
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Alright. Osefer has an answer. Oh boy.

1993
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:22,000
A vogcon would consist of different gingerbread treats and fuzzy red teddy bears named Rob.

1994
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Your sexy gingerbread legs.

1995
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:32,000
The rave would only play disco disco and main dinner entrees would always be garnished with oranges.

1996
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Mmm, vog themed alcoholic drinks.

1997
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
A gingerbread legs martini sounds nice.

1998
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Some cinnamon rum and butterscotch schnapps.

1999
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
You got problems.

2000
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Eww, that sounds nasty.

2001
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
That's so nasty.

2002
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Let's go to Code Man with hopefully a...

2003
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I like Code Man.

2004
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Less scary answer.

2005
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Hanging with the people that I listen to so much and finally, in other words, putting faces to the people that I love listening to.

2006
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Oh, and of course, DDR, Pinkberry, because I've never had it.

2007
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Loki in a tingle costume.

2008
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,000
And most of all, and I repeat this, everyone that makes VOG a network meshing together and having a great time.

2009
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Because in the end, that's what matters most.

2010
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,000
And then you follow that up with, oh, and Taco Cabana for Shane, which Shane liked.

2011
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
See, I like Code Man.

2012
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Who doesn't like tacos?

2013
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I'm gonna give a like for tacos as well.

2014
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I like Code Man. Code Man's cool.

2015
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Yeah, he's cool.

2016
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
We've been supposedly playing Mass Effect 3 online for like two weeks.

2017
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
You know what? My next lol effect picture is going to involve tacos.

2018
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Amazing.

2019
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Everything should involve tacos.

2020
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
In this case, it'll be indigestion.

2021
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Daniel N. replies and says, if I can see the OLR cast and Bobby get back on a DDR pad, and Bobby is in caps,

2022
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:57,000
get back on a DDR pad on Heavy as they are now and a tattoo artist on hand to do Mass Effect art, that would be a good VOG con.

2023
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I believe, and I'm sure I'll get a text message in a few minutes here if I'm incorrect,

2024
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I don't believe Bobby was ever a DDR player.

2025
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
He was way more into Beatmania and all that.

2026
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
You know what's actually funny?

2027
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Well, since I've been getting on my big fitness kick, we're actually gonna be hooking back up the DDR in my house.

2028
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I would play DDR. I would bring back my alter ego, Dr. Dick, one last time at VOG con.

2029
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I liked Mr. Spanky.

2030
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
But you wouldn't cosplay him.

2031
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Remember when I did the DDR tour?

2032
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Do you still have the hat?

2033
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I'm too fat to cosplay Mr. Spanky, and if you think these comments from Ossifer are creepy now...

2034
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Rob, Mr. Spanky was bigger than you.

2035
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Okay? I saw Mr. Spanky and that was disgusting.

2036
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
That is true.

2037
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
By the way, do you still have the hat?

2038
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
That orange fuzzy hat?

2039
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I might, actually.

2040
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,000
You know what I found when I was looking for my art supplies the other day?

2041
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
The orange bat.

2042
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I still have that. I know I have that.

2043
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I have my orange bat.

2044
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I think mine might still have the signatures on it.

2045
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Mine does.

2046
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Nice.

2047
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Some comments from Google+. We can't forget Google+.

2048
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Flaco Jones saying,

2049
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:05,000
How about a trophy presentation to the winningest VOG the game participant of all time?

2050
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Seriously though, any kind of hangout with each show getting a chance to take the stage would be cool.

2051
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
And in Vegas, of course.

2052
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Nobody else suggesting the location.

2053
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I mean, we're in Sacramento, but there's lots of people on VOG.

2054
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
So, we'd have to hold it in some type of central location.

2055
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
So, anyhow.

2056
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Going next to actdeft.

2057
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:30,000
For me, a VOGCon would just simply consist of hanging with all my fellow VOG staffers in the VOG community.

2058
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Playing games, talking or discussing.

2059
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Maybe doing a special show for all the listeners.

2060
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
And doing what friends do. Enjoying the moment with each other.

2061
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Aww.

2062
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Excuse me, hairball.

2063
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And lastly, Rettertainment.

2064
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Loki in a tingle costume.

2065
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
That is like three people that said that.

2066
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
It's not gonna happen.

2067
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
You got the closest thing.

2068
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
The Sackboy was pretty epic.

2069
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
An artistic reenactment of what that would look like.

2070
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
And that was it.

2071
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Alright, awesome.

2072
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I actually read all the answers tonight.

2073
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
But join us on Facebook or Google Plus for future questions.

2074
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
We'll do some more serious ones next time.

2075
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
But I thought that would be a fun question to ask.

2076
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
What's your dream convention?

2077
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I will say this.

2078
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
VOG may not be having a convention this year.

2079
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
But we're gonna be heavily represented at DragonCon this year.

2080
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,000
So I would say if you're in that southeast part of the country.

2081
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Or even if you're not.

2082
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Because I'm not. Really try to plan on that.

2083
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Because I'll be there representing OLR.

2084
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Travis will be there representing Under Sedation Live.

2085
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I'm pretty sure Pod Culture usually goes.

2086
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I'm sure they're still figuring it out.

2087
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Critical Myth I'm positive will be there.

2088
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Bobby will be there. British Invaders went last year.

2089
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
So they'll probably go this year.

2090
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
The only show that probably won't be there.

2091
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I even think Rama is talking about going.

2092
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I could be wrong.

2093
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
But he went to Atlanta for something else.

2094
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
So he can go to DragonCon.

2095
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,000
The only one that I wouldn't know would be Girls Gone Wow.

2096
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
And if we can make that happen.

2097
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Then Lordy we will fly one of their asses in from the UK if we could.

2098
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
So that would be fun.

2099
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Wouldn't you want to party with Sil?

2100
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I would love for people to send me a ticket so I can go to DragonCon.

2101
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
You can get on a bus.

2102
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Dark Sakura across America.

2103
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Alright.

2104
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
There you go.

2105
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Our foogle question of the week.

2106
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Let's get back into some more news about video games.

2107
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Loki.

2108
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Alright.

2109
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
So let's see.

2110
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Double Fine.

2111
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,000
You remember they had that wonderful Kickstarter that kind of brought Kickstarter to the forefront?

2112
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Well Double Fine Adventures now has a name.

2113
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
It is called Broken Age.

2114
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And I guess it was revealed at PAX East.

2115
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
They even have a website now for it at brokenagegame.com.

2116
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
And basically here's what it is.

2117
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Broken Age is a point and click adventure game telling the stories of a young boy and girl leading parallel lives.

2118
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:58,000
The girl has been chosen by her village to be sacrificed to a terrible monster but she decides to fight back.

2119
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Meanwhile a boy on a spaceship is living a solitary life under the care of a motherly computer.

2120
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
But wants to break free and lead an adventure and do good in the world.

2121
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Adventure ensues.

2122
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Adventure ensues.

2123
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
That's the most important part.

2124
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Yes.

2125
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Hijinks occur.

2126
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:24,000
If you didn't back the Kickstarter you can preorder the game via the website.

2127
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
And yeah.

2128
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
So it looks neat.

2129
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I don't really know.

2130
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I'll have to see when the game comes out.

2131
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Well a lot of people already bought it.

2132
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Yeah.

2133
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:45,000
It's going to be one of the first games to come out that just besides maybe what Diablo 3 where they just give a million of them away because people already bought them.

2134
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Yeah.

2135
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
So.

2136
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Alright.

2137
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Anyhow.

2138
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Some updates from Xbox games on demand.

2139
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Some reasons why day and date launches don't always make it to games on demand.

2140
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:06,000
You know there's a big push to try and get games delivered digitally at the exact same time they show up in stores because you know the convenience of downloading them and needing to have that game right now.

2141
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Really goes a long way in selling them.

2142
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I know a lot of people bought Luigi's Mansion digitally because it came out right at midnight.

2143
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,000
And a lot of people were like I can't even wait the six hours to get to the store.

2144
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Or I guess more than six.

2145
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
But you know what I mean.

2146
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Anyhow.

2147
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Eric Yeager the senior business manager of Xbox games on demand.

2148
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:29,000
This is why titles don't launch day and date alongside retail releases.

2149
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Quote.

2150
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
We have a lot of strong partnerships with retailers.

2151
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
We really need them to do a lot for us.

2152
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
They're the ones out there selling the consoles.

2153
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Selling the peripherals.

2154
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:42,000
And in this time we're trying to figure out how to fit that into the whole digital landscape shift.

2155
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
We're just taking a bit of measured pace with it.

2156
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
So very interesting.

2157
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Sort of kind of the converse of what you're seeing with Nintendo.

2158
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:54,000
That they're actually purposely giving a little breathing room to the retailers.

2159
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Which is ironic considering those rumors that gained yet again more steam this week.

2160
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:04,000
We didn't put it on the show roll tonight because it's the same fucking rumor we've heard for a couple months.

2161
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:10,000
But more stuff out there apparently indicating that Xbox the new one will always be online.

2162
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I don't think it's actually going to be online only.

2163
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
What do you think?

2164
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I think that people are misinterpreting what it is.

2165
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
You think it's more of a.

2166
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I was on that.

2167
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I was on that boat too until I read closer and thought about a little bit.

2168
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
I think the wording just a little weird.

2169
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
But what they basically said makes sense.

2170
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
And I think it's going to be.

2171
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
First off there's a few reasons.

2172
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
One.

2173
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
It's incredibly risky to do that.

2174
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Because if they're the only company doing that.

2175
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Remember they have shareholders to answer to.

2176
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,000
And they can't necessarily just go do this thing where.

2177
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Hey we're going to go ahead and cut out all of the retail marketplace.

2178
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Hahaha.

2179
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
You know we're going to sell games digitally only.

2180
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Or you know we're going to basically prevent you from buying.

2181
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
You know selling your game used and that kind of thing.

2182
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Here's what they basically said.

2183
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:00,000
This is coming from some screenshots of the software development kit.

2184
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
On vgleaks.com.

2185
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
And basically they said.

2186
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Where I'm trying to find this exact.

2187
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Durango will implement different power states.

2188
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
So it can be powered on.

2189
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
We'll draw minimal electricity blah blah blah.

2190
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Kind of like the Playstation 4.

2191
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
It says with this always on always connected design.

2192
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
And now but see that's where everyone's like.

2193
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Oh always on always connected.

2194
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
They said the console will be ready instantly when users want to play.

2195
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:32,000
And will maintain a network connection so that the console software and games are always current.

2196
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I think the always on always connected means that it's going to have a standby.

2197
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
And it's going to download those updates for your game.

2198
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
And system updates when it's in standby.

2199
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
So you don't have to fucking wait for an update to happen.

2200
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
That makes more sense.

2201
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:50,000
So I mean this was the same marketing spiel behind we connect 24.

2202
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Even though obviously that didn't do the system updates and stuff.

2203
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I mean the way that reads is an awful lot like they pitched we connect 24.

2204
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:01,000
But see all these blogging sites and some of these guys that are trying to get near these headlines.

2205
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And trust me I bought into it too until I finally read it.

2206
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Always on always connected like oh there you go.

2207
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
It's got to always be connected to the internet.

2208
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
No I think if you want to use this feature where your console updates itself.

2209
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,000
In standby so you don't have to wait for these updates and doesn't have to reset and stuff.

2210
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
That's what they mean by this.

2211
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:24,000
It's a feature so that because no one fucking likes waiting for these updates to happen.

2212
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
You're trying to play a game and oh I got to wait five minutes for this shit to download.

2213
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
That's what they're trying to prevent.

2214
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
And so I think that no use games will be a thing.

2215
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I think that this is what they're trying to do.

2216
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,000
And I think that everyone's going to be like very mistaken when they come out and announce this shit.

2217
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Well thank God it'll all be settled in less than a month hopefully at this point.

2218
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Because the announcement is supposed to be in April right?

2219
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
The end of April.

2220
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Please let this be over with soon.

2221
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Dark Soccer in the meantime.

2222
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Well I have Mass Effect news.

2223
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
As we warned you.

2224
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
But this is actually really sad.

2225
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:05,000
They're basically going into how seamless it was to get the character of Nirene the Female Turian in the Omega DLC.

2226
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
That it was actually really smooth to get her accepted.

2227
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Except that that's really an exception to the case.

2228
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:18,000
We've had plenty of games go through where a female character has been proposed.

2229
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:24,000
And the game is shot down simply because of the gender of the main player, the protagonist.

2230
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Like Remember Me was shot down for the same reason.

2231
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
And that there's a statement going out that basically.

2232
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:38,000
And I really liked this statement here that's by the creative director for Remember Me.

2233
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Jean Maxime Morris said if you think that there's no way this medium is going to mature.

2234
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
So it's really a lot of misogyny we need to.

2235
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Those stats they put out for that Mass Effect 3 panel were pretty eye opening though.

2236
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
What was it only 18%?

2237
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
18% of players beat it with Female Shepherd.

2238
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
But that is, if you'll notice, the loudest part of the fandom.

2239
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Is that 18%.

2240
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
And honestly I chalk that up to bros.

2241
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Caden is a squadmate less than 2% of the time.

2242
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
I couldn't believe that.

2243
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
That's because he was a whiny bitch.

2244
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Kidding.

2245
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
So are you but you've been on 100% of these shows.

2246
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2247
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Yeah I've been on more like 95%.

2248
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Still.

2249
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
But the other thing too is that they almost didn't make Tally playable in Mass Effect 3.

2250
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Which would have been a shame.

2251
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Basically enough people were passionate about it that they made her playable.

2252
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:41,000
But I guess that might have to be why she wasn't even available until like halfway through the game.

2253
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
And I mean I've been running across people who say,

2254
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Oh she's so irritating, she's so annoying.

2255
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I was like, hell she was great.

2256
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Even though she's not like a very strong squadmate.

2257
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I remember reading some story and I don't know if there's something you'd put on Tumblr or where.

2258
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
But that a lot of characters weren't playable in Mass Effect 2.

2259
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Because they didn't want you to get them killed before 3.

2260
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Well yeah that was it too.

2261
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:10,000
They were saying because they were part of I guess something that they had in mind for 3.

2262
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
So that's why they didn't have them playable.

2263
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
But still I think that everybody should have been playable for the last one.

2264
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
There's a lot of stuff that could have gone better about Mass Effect 3.

2265
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

2266
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Some of those PAX East panels weren't broadcast. I hope they post them online like the BioWare one.

2267
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Me too. I'd love to see that actually.

2268
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Yeah.

2269
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Alright. Well we'll get to the mailbag shortly.

2270
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Or no. Do we get any emails this week?

2271
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
No. Just the one that was just more for direction.

2272
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Are we reading it or no? I guess not.

2273
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Alright.

2274
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I checked. There's nothing else so.

2275
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Well shame on all of you guys for not emailing us.

2276
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Yeah how dare you.

2277
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

2278
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Well we still have some news stories.

2279
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Well thank you capstrapootmoggy. I like tally as well.

2280
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Alright we still have some news stories for you guys.

2281
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Loki.

2282
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,000
So this is kind of cool. There's a partnership that was announced by Sony and Unity.

2283
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Basically the Unity engine will now have ways to port games to the Playstation platform.

2284
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Including Playstation 4, PS3, Vita and Playstation Mobile.

2285
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:21,000
And using these I guess it will be easier to take advantage of different system stuff.

2286
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Like the cameras and the touchpads and that kind of stuff.

2287
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Playstation Network.

2288
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:35,000
And they say also because of that it will allow people to port titles easier to iOS and Android as well.

2289
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
And I guess there's already some games that have used this.

2290
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Including Might and Delight's PID and Funbit's Escape Plan.

2291
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Oh I saw Funbit's Escape Plan.

2292
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Oh that was built in that game? That's pretty cool.

2293
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Remember that. That was the launch title.

2294
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
PID and Funbit. Or PID.

2295
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
What's PID?

2296
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I have no idea. PID is.

2297
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
But yeah. Escape Plan looked kind of cool.

2298
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
So cool.

2299
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
And I know a lot of people use Unity for all sorts of things.

2300
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
So porting games will be easier.

2301
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
And it sounds like that they kind of are embracing kind of indie development a little bit better.

2302
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I think they're finding out that hey these indie titles that we're bringing over to like the Vita and stuff seem to be doing well for us.

2303
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Let's get them more involved with other consoles.

2304
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Making it easier to get your game on there. So I like that.

2305
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Is this something that will be for PlayStation 3 and 4?

2306
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Yeah. It's all stuff. 3, 4, Vita and mobile.

2307
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Well that's pretty cool.

2308
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Again it's with a new console coming out this year it seems like there's so much still on the PlayStation 3.

2309
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Yeah it's kind of hard to sell your next console when there's all this stuff coming to your current console.

2310
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Well you guys remember Street Fighter X Tekken.

2311
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:05,000
And it was okay. I don't think it was as good as a lot of people were hoping it would be.

2312
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
On Disney or DLC.

2313
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
That's one of the things it will be remembered for forever.

2314
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Well remember Street Fighter X Tekken wasn't the only game that was supposed to happen there.

2315
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
There was supposed to be another game, Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

2316
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Which was Namco's version of the game basically.

2317
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
As more of a Tekken style fighter.

2318
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
No news on that in a while.

2319
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:30,000
But producer Katsuhiro Harada responding to a fan on Twitter said quote.

2320
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
We are changing and considering platform strategy.

2321
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
That's why we don't say anything.

2322
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
So a lot of people are speculating that based on that message.

2323
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Oh they're going to move it up to PlayStation 4 and the new Xbox.

2324
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
As opposed to the current gen which would make a lot of sense.

2325
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
It would also kind of give them a chance to really reinvent some things.

2326
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:55,000
And hopefully make people forget about the fact that they didn't care for Street Fighter X Tekken.

2327
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
So you can't really see how this is bad news.

2328
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Except the fact that it's going to be a little while longer before this game comes out.

2329
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
DarkSakura, I know you're a fighting girl fan.

2330
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
You're a fighting game girl fan.

2331
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Are you excited about Tekken Cross Street Fighter?

2332
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I'm reserving judgement.

2333
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I'm not going to get it right away.

2334
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Okay.

2335
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Unless that trailer comes out and you're like oh my god.

2336
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Oh my god Jen. Oh my god Ryu.

2337
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
So we'll see.

2338
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
I like even this little teaser image. Ryu looks great.

2339
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I like him kind of the Tekken style.

2340
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Well I even have to say that I've always been a fan of the Street Fighter characters done in the style of another game.

2341
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Like remember SNK?

2342
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I loved their renditions of the Street Fighter characters.

2343
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Not on the show roll tonight but I want to say I heard that CVS2 is supposed to be coming out for PlayStation Classics or something like that.

2344
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
So you can get it on PS3.

2345
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
That would sort of be a big why for me.

2346
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Because it's awesome.

2347
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Because I've already got it.

2348
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Yeah.

2349
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I would like to see it re-release. You could do like online battles would be pretty cool but.

2350
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,000
For matching service. We need more games that say for matching service in the title.

2351
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
We do need.

2352
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
You know I've actually got the Vampire Savior for matching service.

2353
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
That I forgot completely that we actually owned that game.

2354
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
So I might sell it.

2355
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Did you ever read gamer girl's comment in chat here Loki about PID?

2356
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
PID is a side scroller in which you play a little boy who gets lost and gets put on a planet and has to find his way home.

2357
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
And she gives you a link there to PID.

2358
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
All right.

2359
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Tigerclaw following up with the Mass Effect information from earlier saying there was some mention about the Mass Effect movie during that panel.

2360
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
But nothing like when it's coming out because I don't think they even started.

2361
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
They've never even. They haven't even started yet.

2362
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,000
You know I'd probably see it out of morbid fascination but I just wouldn't.

2363
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:56,000
For me. I am so deeply entrenched into the game playing as a female shepherd that to think of playing it as a guy is inconceivable to me.

2364
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I really hope somebody puts their foot down and makes it a fem chef.

2365
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
I can. I really do.

2366
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I think it would be a great character but I don't know.

2367
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I also kind of want them to really fuck with the fandom and do something really atrocious in the game like do a decision that like can't even happen in the game.

2368
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Like have Caden and Ashley survive Vermaier or like something that just totally like makes fan boys and fan girls just like what are you doing.

2369
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I really want that to happen.

2370
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I want Dark Soccer to twitch nervously when she's watching Mass Effect.

2371
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Honestly. I wouldn't care.

2372
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I want Garrus to die.

2373
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
No! No!

2374
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Oh my god Rob I can't believe you'd say something so horrible.

2375
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Okay.

2376
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I'm done. I'm gonna leave right now to get my soda.

2377
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Alright. This is the part where we would do the mailbag.

2378
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Fuck you.

2379
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
But you didn't email us. Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

2380
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Maybe you should do that for next time.

2381
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:07,000
So instead we'll go right into the FUs of the week even though this is really not a good time to be doing that but it is what it is.

2382
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:23,000
This is fucked up.

2383
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I have two FUs really. One of them is to my iPad for not supporting Java so that I can sign up for something that Rob's gonna be talking about later.

2384
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:40,000
And then my other one goes to the stupid bitch face.

2385
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Okay I actually have another one than that.

2386
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,000
To bitch face number one who was in the car in front of me and one of those homeless guy panhandlers was outside.

2387
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And she turned on her windshield wipers for the entire period of time that we were at the light and started flinging water at him.

2388
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
And it was clearly on purpose because her car was not dirty.

2389
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
You could see all the way through her windshield and back windshield.

2390
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
She's just doing it to be a bitch.

2391
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
So I gave him 50 cents.

2392
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Instead I apologize on behalf of humanity.

2393
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Not really. But I did give him money.

2394
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,000
And then to my former boss bitch face.

2395
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I don't care if you fuck with me. Don't fuck with my friends.

2396
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I'm done.

2397
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Logie.

2398
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Um. I guess I have to be the fact that my coworkers gone so I got no one to talk to.

2399
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Yeah.

2400
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Fuck my hand for being weak. Thank you Rob.

2401
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I opened a bottle for Dark Sakura.

2402
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Cause I'm strong.

2403
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Cause all the pressure builds up inside.

2404
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Alright.

2405
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
And fuck the Mass Effect movie.

2406
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,000
F you to the freaking wild turkeys in this neighborhood.

2407
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
They're all assholes.

2408
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Like one of them literally flew right in front of my car today with a death wish.

2409
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Wanting me to hit.

2410
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
So I have to slam on the brakes.

2411
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Thank god there wasn't a car behind me or I probably would have been in an accident.

2412
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I probably would have gotten whiplash thanks to the stupid fucking turkey that lives near here.

2413
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
So F you to the turkeys.

2414
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Why you so stupid turkeys?

2415
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Tell me.

2416
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Did you know that actually turkeys were rated as one of the most stupid animals to live?

2417
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Well thank god we eat so many of them once a year.

2418
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I wouldn't eat the wild turkeys in this neighborhood.

2419
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Who knows what the fuck they've been eating.

2420
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
That's true.

2421
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
They probably taste like radiation.

2422
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Alright.

2423
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
That does it for the FUs of the week.

2424
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
A couple more news stories for you guys.

2425
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2426
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Or our username on Skype.

2427
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2428
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
But first a couple stories.

2429
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:54,000
So apparently there has been some research into video games and their effects on kids with dyslexia.

2430
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
And actually allowing them to be able to read.

2431
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
And this is kind of cool.

2432
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,000
They did a study basically where they had 20 kids.

2433
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,000
20 dyslexic children playing Rayman's Raving Rabbids.

2434
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Which is crazy as it is.

2435
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
For a total of 12 hours over 9 days.

2436
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:19,000
And of course the game has a ton of crazy mini games and that kind of fun stuff.

2437
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:28,000
And basically before and after the 9 days of game playing the researchers tested the kids on several different tasks.

2438
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Including reading speed and accuracy, word recognition, and their ability to pay attention to multiple types of input.

2439
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Sight and sound at once.

2440
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Before playing the games the two groups were both equivalent in these tasks.

2441
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:50,000
But after 12 hours of the games the kids that played the mini games showed significant improvements in their ability to read.

2442
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:56,000
They read faster, more accurately, and they recognized more words than they had before the treatment.

2443
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Meanwhile the children that had played non-active mini games didn't do any better on the tests.

2444
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
So that's kind of neat.

2445
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I think that's a great story with all the crap that video games get sometimes.

2446
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I'm glad to hear something where it's bona fide showing that it's helping in a particular scenario here.

2447
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
You know, helping children with this. It's great.

2448
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:23,000
It's almost like all those years spent telling mom it improves my hand-eye coordination.

2449
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Like now there's the science to back it up.

2450
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Yes.

2451
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
But the science has always been there.

2452
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I mean for the sake of reading.

2453
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
And this is something actually we learned in typography.

2454
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:38,000
The human brain will read lowercase letters better than it will read anything that's all caps.

2455
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,000
A good reader reads the shape of the words, not the individual letters.

2456
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:50,000
So doing something that's going to improve time cognition for getting instinctive action over slow and methodical picking it out

2457
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:55,000
would definitely, I think, improve that skill when it comes to actually reading a shape of a word.

2458
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:59,000
You know that's really funny because when I was studying broadcast journalism

2459
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:04,000
whenever you look at scripts for TV shows and stuff or the teleprompters, everything's always written in caps.

2460
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,000
And it's not, you know, everybody makes that joke like, why are you yelling though?

2461
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
But they actually say it's to make you slow down.

2462
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
That's why they write scripts like that.

2463
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Exactly.

2464
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Because it's the opposite of what you're saying.

2465
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I'll say one more thing on the subject.

2466
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,000
They were doing a study of different types of readers.

2467
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,000
You know, basically really slow, really low level readers and then higher level readers.

2468
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,000
And they timed blink rates and pause rates for when people were reading.

2469
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:40,000
And the slower readers would blink and pause more often, usually in the middle of a word as opposed to at the end of sections of words.

2470
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Very cool.

2471
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
All right. One more news story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.

2472
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:50,000
And it's about a sequel to an old favorite here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2473
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Gravity Entertainment recently announced Ragnarok Online 2.

2474
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Actually, this wasn't years ago they announced this.

2475
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Yeah, yeah, but I don't care because I'm signing up.

2476
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Ragnarok Online 2, Legend of the Second.

2477
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
With music done by Yoko Kanno.

2478
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Really?

2479
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Yeah.

2480
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
That's awesome.

2481
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Apparently, this game is now finally almost here.

2482
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
It's supposed to be an open beta in mid-April.

2483
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Pre-registration is available.

2484
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
You can also check it out on the Facebook page.

2485
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I want to check out this little trailer here in studio.

2486
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:26,000
And if it goes anything like the last Ragnarok Online, it's going to be in beta for seven years.

2487
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Most likely.

2488
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Is there any actual gameplay in this video, or is it just a bunch of frickin' cutscenes?

2489
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
No, but there's YouTube video from the alpha.

2490
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Will I get to fight, what were they called, Prinnies, the little slime people?

2491
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Pourings.

2492
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Pourings.

2493
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Oh, Prinnies are the dudes from Disgaea. What am I thinking?

2494
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Oh my god, the alphas look so awesome.

2495
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Okay, how long did I play Ragnarok Online, Rob?

2496
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I don't know, how long until they banned you!

2497
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
No, no they didn't. I actually played, I was one of, let's put it this way,

2498
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,000
if I go back and play the International Ragnarok Online right now,

2499
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I can get all of my characters back and all of my old stuff because I was in the alpha.

2500
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Because you're a super nerd and you have a badge to prove it.

2501
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
I sure do.

2502
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Alright, well let us know if you're able to get in the beta for Ragnarok Online 2 and don't get banned.

2503
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Alright.

2504
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
I've never been banned!

2505
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
You're banned from this show, get out.

2506
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I used to be friends with some of the GMs, shit.

2507
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Alright, we are at the end of our news, so we're going to open up the Skype line.

2508
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:33,000
And I'm hoping we're going to hear from some people that went to PAX East tonight.

2509
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
So we're going to open up the phones and see what happens.

2510
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:39,000
1-877-GAME-OLR is the toll free number you can use to call.

2511
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

2512
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:48,000
But remember, if you do call us on Skype, you want to call ECHO123 first, just to test your connection.

2513
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Oh, phone's already lighting up, we got a call.

2514
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2515
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
I'm driving recklessly, guys.

2516
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Hey, Bobby!

2517
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I just got in the door.

2518
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
You just literally walked in the door back from PAX East.

2519
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
But is the fence still intact?

2520
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Yes! It is.

2521
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Is it offensive?

2522
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
No, did you hear about Bobby's fence drama?

2523
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
No.

2524
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Oh, about the people cutting through his yard?

2525
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Yeah.

2526
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,000
And then the kids that decided once I locked it that they needed to teach me a lesson by tearing it down?

2527
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Fuck them.

2528
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Then didn't you get it all fixed and then a little mini tornado took it out anyway or something?

2529
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:32,000
They took one of the other signs. The mini tornado took my 99 cent no trespassing sign.

2530
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
So I had to replace that.

2531
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
I'm not reporting that to my insurance, though.

2532
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
You were not having luck this week.

2533
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
But then you got to go to PAX East and hopefully that made it all better, right?

2534
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Yes, it did.

2535
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Well, how was it?

2536
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:51,000
It was great. I had a great time. I met a lot of people, especially from the community, and I wanted to open up with this.

2537
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,000
And I told him I was going to say this.

2538
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Because I've been listening to OLR for a long time. Maybe not all ten years.

2539
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:07,000
But I've been listening to OLR and a lot of times during OLR I always roll my eyes because what do I hear near the end of the show?

2540
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Hi, this is Legend of Zaku. How are you doing, Rob?

2541
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
So I actually got to meet Legend of Zaku.

2542
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:22,000
And he's actually an energetic, interesting, fun person to be around.

2543
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
He's nothing like what you hear on Sunday night.

2544
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,000
He's a great guy, and I hope he's on to hear this.

2545
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Because people in the past have actually said, like, why do you let that guy on your show?

2546
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:38,000
And I'm like, because if you meet him, he's actually kind of cool, so stay pressed.

2547
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Every gamer has a voice, right?

2548
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
And he's basically saying, yeah, I'm just chill because I have to work the next morning and everything.

2549
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,000
But Friday night he's bouncing off the walls and everything.

2550
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Good times.

2551
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I just wanted to give that little insight to OLR.

2552
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Yeah, he's like, hi, this is Legend of Zaku.

2553
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,000
No, he actually does have a personality, and it's a good one.

2554
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,000
You've got to pound on the keyboard.

2555
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Alright.

2556
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
So you got to meet a lot of people, right?

2557
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Like, SSJ100Matt was there, right?

2558
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I met SSJ100Matt a couple times.

2559
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I met Jon from Critical Myth.

2560
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Met up with him.

2561
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Met up with Ranma and a bunch of people from the cosplay group that he's in.

2562
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Anime Jam Session.

2563
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I got to meet Misty.

2564
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
And Hitstun found us.

2565
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
And met some other people from the community.

2566
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
It was a good time. I didn't get to see Havoc978.

2567
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:37,000
I didn't go to the Bring Your Own Computer area all that often, so that's kind of where he hangs out.

2568
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:45,000
But comparing PAX East to PAX Prime, I can see why they're saying that PAX East is the real PAX.

2569
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Just because that convention center is huge.

2570
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I don't know if the one you went to was in this convention center.

2571
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:56,000
No, I went to the very first one that was at that other convention center downtown that I don't think they have it at anymore.

2572
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,000
It's the same one that Anime Boston, I think, is at.

2573
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I think, yeah, it's the Boston Convention Center, which is really close to the airport, which is great.

2574
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Because I'm so used to, like, in Los Angeles and Seattle, it's like a 40-minute cab ride to get from the airport to the convention center.

2575
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
In this one, it's like, you know, 10 bucks.

2576
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Well, the problem is LA is gigantic, and then the Seattle airport is actually Seattle-Tacoma.

2577
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
So it's in between the two.

2578
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
We had that nice limo ride.

2579
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Yeah, that was the first limo ride I ever took in my life was when we went to Penny Arcade Expo from the airport there.

2580
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Because we were like, we're rock stars, we're taking a limo.

2581
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Actually, when we did the DDR Freak moderator trip, they sprung for us to get limos from the...

2582
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Must be nice.

2583
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
It was fun in Las Vegas.

2584
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Didn't you get to ride the limos for the Windows 7, the Microsoft Windows thing?

2585
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
That was the second, that was after that PAX.

2586
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Okay, that was the E3, yeah.

2587
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,000
And that video we made that never got put on the internet, but whatever.

2588
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Yeah, they stopped at the one that me and Glenn did.

2589
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
That was the one they stopped at.

2590
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
And they're like, we can send you the raw assets if you want to cut something together.

2591
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
And we're like, no, that's not why we did it.

2592
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:14,000
So the thing that's kind of funny is because I did a podcast with the Boston Bastard Brigade and Electric Sistahood,

2593
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:21,000
and there was a whole bunch of other podcasters, and we did a podcast that's going to be coming out this week sometime.

2594
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
We recorded it this morning at 10 AM.

2595
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
It was actually a lot of fun being in there.

2596
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
It was a round table type podcast.

2597
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:33,000
But what struck me as interesting, and they had to cut off the end of the podcast because they were losing that room,

2598
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:37,000
was that they were treating this a lot like E3.

2599
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,000
And they're like, what do you think of PAX? What games did you play on the show floor?

2600
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,000
And I couldn't get in that I'm like, I think they missed the point of PAX.

2601
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:50,000
I mean, the show floor is a big part of it, but PAX is so much bigger than that.

2602
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:55,000
And some of the stuff that I saw at PAX that really blew me away was not on the show floor.

2603
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I walked in, and this just hit my nostalgia bone. Two things hit my nostalgia bone.

2604
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I walked into one room. It's really dark.

2605
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:10,000
And all it had in there, and I'm not kidding, 16 fully functional steel battalions.

2606
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
That sounds awesome.

2607
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Eight of them were system link with the multiplayer game, and then they had four playing the single player.

2608
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
That sounds like my house, except I have two.

2609
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Sixteen, all fully functional, and they had the one enforcer who knew everything about the game,

2610
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:32,000
and he was yelling at people kind of military style and giving them, kind of like the old,

2611
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:37,000
kind of like the spiel that you would get from Mecor if you're doing the battle tech pods and stuff.

2612
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
So that was really neat. And then they had the classic console room.

2613
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:46,000
And they actually did, in the corner, have like a Commodore 64 with a five and a quarter inch disk drive.

2614
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:51,000
That you could load in, and they had the Apple IIe with the disks.

2615
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:58,000
And just going through there, and that and MagFest, the music and game convention,

2616
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:04,000
they had a room, and it was jam sessions, and Megaran performed in there outside of the normal concerts,

2617
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,000
like the big name concerts. They had the smaller, lesser known bands actually perform in this room,

2618
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:16,000
and it was all day. And that's what sets PAX apart from E3, even though if you listen to most podcasts,

2619
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,000
they're going to concentrate on the E3 aspects of PAX.

2620
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:27,000
But what about that show floor? Because there were some games that showed up that we hadn't heard of yet,

2621
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:34,000
like Hearthstone, and we talked earlier in the show about Saints Row IV, and the DuckTales game from Capcom.

2622
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Okay, let me start here, okay? Because we rag on Capcom, right?

2623
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Right, of course.

2624
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:46,000
We mess everything up. I mean, I thought that I had played the worst demo in the world, Ni No Kuni.

2625
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:52,000
And then Capcom comes along and Capcom's the demo. Because Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate,

2626
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:57,000
the worst demo I have ever played. Ni No Kuni is no longer the worst demo I've ever played.

2627
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Yeah, no, I actually mentioned, you were surprised on the plane we were doing Gaming Week,

2628
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:07,000
but I actually mentioned you and that whole thing in Gaming Week, because I hated the demo as well.

2629
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:11,000
But I have friends that love Monster Hunter, and I'm like, I wouldn't know that from this demo.

2630
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:17,000
And so, yeah, I think I landed, and we were on the Classic Game of the Week when I got in my car from the airport.

2631
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Anyway, I'll catch the podcast. So, I learned, okay, they're doing DuckTales, and I'm like, they can't mess this up.

2632
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:33,000
How can Capcom mess this up? I just, I just, you can't, I mean, it was perfect, and stuff.

2633
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
You want to know how Capcom messed this up?

2634
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
They let the Pink Palace developers do it.

2635
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
No, no, no, here's how they messed it up at PAX.

2636
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:41,000
How?

2637
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:45,000
There's only one copy of the game in the entire city of Boston.

2638
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:51,000
One copy on one single kiosk. It's a seven-minute demo.

2639
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:58,000
The line went around the corner of the booth, and they had to cap it because it was already four hours long.

2640
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:02,000
To play the seven-minute demo. It was the only copy they had.

2641
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,000
They did not have any other copies for press to go behind the scenes.

2642
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,000
They do a GDC. They're going to be shown at a GDC behind the scenes to people who are going to be there.

2643
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:15,000
But that was the only copy they had, and, see, here's the thing that a lot of people probably don't realize,

2644
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
is that Capcom in that panel announced two games.

2645
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:24,000
They announced DuckTales, and they announced this remake of the old Dungeons & Dragons four-player arcade game.

2646
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:29,000
And so their idea was they were going to have those two games just next, side by side, next to each other.

2647
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Nobody's playing the Dungeons & Dragons game.

2648
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Oh, that's sad.

2649
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I know, that game is absolutely awesome.

2650
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
To be fair, though, news about that one had leaked last week.

2651
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Because I remember talking about it on last week's show.

2652
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
We already kind of knew that was coming.

2653
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
But the DuckTales one was a complete surprise.

2654
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:47,000
And so I was up there, and I asked the lady from Capcom,

2655
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,000
I'm like, so, why do you only have one kiosk of this, that?

2656
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
And she shot me this look.

2657
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Like, oh my god, I wish you had not asked that question.

2658
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,000
And this is like an hour after they had unveiled that side of the booth.

2659
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
It was covered up until the panel.

2660
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,000
And so I, in order to save her, I was like, is that the million dollar question?

2661
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,000
She's like, that's the five million dollar question.

2662
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:13,000
So they are, they knew, like I think when everybody started singing in that panel,

2663
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I think they realized they messed up only bringing one copy of the game.

2664
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I think it's because it's running on dev kits, and they only have minimum amounts of dev kits.

2665
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:27,000
That's exactly my thought, because remember, GDC is happening literally, what, tomorrow or Tuesday?

2666
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Starts Tuesday.

2667
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Yeah, when GDC starts, all the dev kits are probably in San Francisco.

2668
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
They can't be in two places at once.

2669
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
No, Rob, Passover starts tomorrow.

2670
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Anyway.

2671
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,000
But what they could have done is since nobody's touching that stupid Dungeons and Dragons game,

2672
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
make that DuckTales!

2673
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
That's not stupid!

2674
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Put on the last stage, you know, cover up the Dungeons and Dragons with like a really,

2675
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:52,000
you know, crude notebook paper and Sharpie saying DuckTales.

2676
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
And just do that.

2677
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:57,000
And then that four hour wait would have been a two hour wait.

2678
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I'm gonna get the one dude to come by.

2679
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Where's Dungeons and Dragons?

2680
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I heard there was a Dungeons and Dragons game, I wanna play it.

2681
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Dude, okay, the Dungeons and Dragons game is awesome, and I probably would have played that

2682
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:10,000
if everyone else was over DuckTales.

2683
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Yeah, you could have walked right up to play that one.

2684
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,000
But then there's the long line of everybody trying to watch DuckTales.

2685
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:20,000
And what does it say about, I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing,

2686
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,000
so this is an open question, what does this say about PAX in terms of game announcements,

2687
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:29,000
considering this was not the only game announced there, that the most excited people got

2688
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:34,000
over an announcement at PAX was a remake of an NES game?

2689
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
It's one that's near and dear to everybody's hearts, though.

2690
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I mean, you go great NES games, and people remember, DuckTales is on a lot of lists.

2691
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
So, I mean, I can kind of see it.

2692
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,000
And it does look great.

2693
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
I hope it delivers.

2694
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:57,000
But aside from that, the best part about PAX is that they embrace the indie culture.

2695
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:02,000
And the indie games. And the indie games take up pretty much half the show floor, is all indie games.

2696
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Probably even more so than your AAA titles.

2697
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Because you gotta realize Activision wasn't there, Sony really wasn't there that much,

2698
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,000
they had The Last of Us, and that was about it.

2699
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:17,000
But indie games, like just all these crazy ideas, I actually played on an Ouya.

2700
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Oh my gosh, they exist!

2701
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,000
It exists, the controller is terrible.

2702
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Aw, Quincy!

2703
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:28,000
It's unresponsive, but I actually played a game that actually makes use of that touchpad

2704
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
in a way that makes sense.

2705
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:35,000
In the same touchpad that's gonna be on the Playstation 4, the game I played there is a Saturday morning RPG.

2706
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:41,000
It's an 8-bit, kind of, turn-based RPG, but with a lot of, like, some of the minigames in there,

2707
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:44,000
you're playing Simon, and stuff like that.

2708
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,000
It's about, like, basically Saturday morning cartoons or this kid's real life.

2709
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:51,000
But right before each battle, you scratch off stickers.

2710
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,000
And that's what you use the touchpad for.

2711
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
By scratching, you act like you're scratching off a sticker.

2712
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:03,000
So, it was a neat game, and it's actually a launch title for the Ouya, so I played that a little bit.

2713
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:07,000
And the buttons on the Ouya controller, it's O-U-Y-A.

2714
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Of course.

2715
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:12,000
And so it's like, press O to do this, so I press what winds up being the A button on the controller,

2716
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:15,000
because that's the circle button on the Playstation controller.

2717
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
It's gonna take some getting used to.

2718
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,000
And even the developer said, I don't like the button placement.

2719
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Like, I don't like the way they did that.

2720
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Like, you know, they should have been some kind of standard or something.

2721
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
But I did play that.

2722
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,000
But there were some other neat things that I saw that I wasn't able to get interviews with.

2723
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:35,000
There's, for the hardcore of the hardcore, I'm talking, like, I don't know if Dungeon Buster's in chat,

2724
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
because, like, this is up his alley.

2725
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
He is in chat.

2726
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Okay, he is in chat.

2727
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Dungeon Buster, this is straight up your alley.

2728
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
The game's called Artemis.

2729
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:50,000
And this is a spacecraft simulator, in the sense like the old Star Trek.

2730
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
So imagine the Enterprise.

2731
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Except it's multiplayer across PC, iPad, iPhone, I think even Android.

2732
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,000
And you are basically a crew member.

2733
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:04,000
And so what they had set up, they had them on laptops there.

2734
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
And they had five stations.

2735
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:13,000
You have your captain, your science officer, your engineering officer, your navigation, and your weapons guy.

2736
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
And you're all cross-talking.

2737
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
You have your screen.

2738
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,000
And the way they had it set up there is you had your screen that had, like, a radar and things you could do.

2739
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Then they had a main screen that actually had the 3D render of what it was doing.

2740
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,000
And they were all talking to each other.

2741
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Okay, you know, turn the ship to 160 degrees.

2742
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
You know, get close.

2743
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Okay, comm officer, request docking.

2744
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Comm officer will say, okay, you know, we've got permission to dock.

2745
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,000
And then the navigation perk guy would actually dock with the station.

2746
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
And then, you know, battle stuff.

2747
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
They would look at, you know, okay, when do I turn on the shields?

2748
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
And the captain would start yelling out orders.

2749
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:49,000
And it's this social game where basically all of you are working together to fly the spaceship,

2750
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:53,000
have space battles, and I guess deliver cargo and stuff.

2751
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:57,000
It was amazingly interesting.

2752
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I didn't get a chance to play it because it was a 20-minute demo.

2753
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
So it was kind of hard to get in on it.

2754
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
But that's actually out now.

2755
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:09,000
And here's the thing about Artemis, is that they don't like DRM.

2756
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:16,000
And so what you can do is when you buy the game, you're actually buying a license to the ship.

2757
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:21,000
So basically you buy that one ship, and they don't check for this.

2758
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
So this is honor system.

2759
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:27,000
But then you can send the game to five of your buddies as long as they're all flying on your ship.

2760
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:31,000
So only one person has to buy the game for five people to fly the ship and play the game.

2761
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,000
That's pretty cool.

2762
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,000
It's kind of like a DS title where everybody can download from the one person.

2763
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
I don't know, kind of.

2764
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
That's kind of what I'm thinking of when you say that.

2765
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
That's really cool.

2766
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
So that was one of the games that I saw.

2767
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Another game that a lot of people were probably talking about,

2768
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I don't know if you ever heard of this game called Divekick.

2769
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
I think so, yeah.

2770
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Divekick, this is the most complex fighting game ever.

2771
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,000
And it's coming out for PlayStation 3 and Vita and stuff like that.

2772
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:02,000
And the way that they had it there was that they actually had an arcade-style controller.

2773
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,000
There are two buttons, dive and kick.

2774
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,000
And so you select your character, and there were five characters in the game.

2775
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,000
And one of them is kind of funny because the name of the character was Wolverine.

2776
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,000
And so they got a cease and desist letter.

2777
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:21,000
So the name of that character is now redacted with a strike through it.

2778
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:25,000
So basically in Divekick, it's the standard thing.

2779
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:29,000
And you have the little guy go, okay, ready? Divekick!

2780
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:34,000
And then you can jump with the dive button and then kick with the kick button.

2781
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Or if you just hit the kick button, you dive.

2782
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:40,000
And it's basically whoever hits the other person first, it's a one-shot kill.

2783
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Even though it shows all these health bars at the stop, but it's a one-hit thing.

2784
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:46,000
And you're basically just jumping and diving, and that's all you're doing.

2785
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:52,000
And it is the most hilarious, funny fighting game I've ever played.

2786
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:56,000
So it sounds like you saw a lot of gems, really, like these little indie gems.

2787
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
I did not see a bad game.

2788
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
That's good.

2789
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I did not see a bad game. Even in the card game, board game section, I did not see a bad game.

2790
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Because the area was probably just as big as the video game section,

2791
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:13,000
but they had the whole tabletop section, and the entire perimeter of the tabletop section

2792
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:19,000
were vendors and people showing off tabletop board games, card games, things like that.

2793
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
And that was in there, and that's where I actually played a game that I actually did buy,

2794
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:28,000
a card game called Flame War, which triggered my PTSD of the G4 forums thing.

2795
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Because you're playing as a forum moderator, trying to create forum threads and then closing them,

2796
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
but the way that you attack other players, you flame on their threads.

2797
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:40,000
And all the cards have internet memes on them.

2798
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Awesome.

2799
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:45,000
And so I did buy it, and one of the cards is the ban hammer.

2800
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:49,000
And so people that were around in the G4 days, they actually were selling a shirt of the ban hammer,

2801
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:53,000
which was basically a hammer that said ban in it, and yes, I did buy that shirt.

2802
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Of course, you have to.

2803
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:58,000
I have the ban hammer shirt, so anybody that remembers me from the G4 days will appreciate that.

2804
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
That is amazing.

2805
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Obviously, you say PAX is a lot more than just the expo floor, the community and all that.

2806
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I saw some pictures on Facebook.

2807
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:13,000
It looks like you guys were up very late playing Cards Against Humanity.

2808
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Yes, and that was pretty much like...

2809
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,000
At Dragon Con, I'm used to seeing people in a circle playing Are You a Werewolf?

2810
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
And here, everybody was playing Cards Against Humanity.

2811
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Because they released the third expansion, which sold out on Saturday.

2812
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:33,000
But they also had these three PAX East exclusive packs that you could get.

2813
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
If you found them, you got them.

2814
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:39,000
And they were either in the swag bag or if you went to the Kickstarter room, you could get it from them.

2815
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
And they were handing them out.

2816
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Cards Against Humanity was huge at PAX.

2817
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:48,000
A lot of people were playing that everywhere that you looked.

2818
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:52,000
I think that game took off.

2819
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,000
I think that's a Kickstarter success story right there.

2820
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Probably Streetpassed with about 11 billion people.

2821
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Yes, I would have Streetpassed with more if I kept at it, but I wound up filling all my pieces and completing Find Me.

2822
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,000
But I now have, I think, over 1,000 Streetpasses total.

2823
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:14,000
And that's from all the E3 and all the other stuff that I've done with it.

2824
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,000
I'm only up to 500 and I thought I had a ton from...

2825
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Well, you see, I thought I had a ton too.

2826
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
And then I was sitting next to somebody when I went into the Rock Band panel.

2827
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Which is the only panel I went to, which was the behind the scenes.

2828
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:28,000
They named names and everything. It was awesome. It's never going to be broadcast.

2829
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
But I was sitting there and he had like 2,800.

2830
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,000
And I remarked on it and he just looked at me and was like, I'm a cast member at Disney World.

2831
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,000
And so the Rock Band panel was, you're never going to see it broadcast.

2832
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Because they actually spent about 10 minutes saying, we could get in so much trouble if you...

2833
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:52,000
And they're looking right at the IGN and the Polygon guys in the front row with their laptops out.

2834
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,000
And they kept looking and they're like, don't write this. Please don't write this.

2835
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Because they actually were naming names.

2836
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:03,000
And talking about, here's where we fucked up, is basically what it was.

2837
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:08,000
And they went through, hey, we announced Rock Band Japan. Yeah, let's tell you what happened with that.

2838
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,000
And they were showing video, like concept video of Rock Band Japan.

2839
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:17,000
And basically Rock Band Japan died because Japanese licensing is worse than American music licensing.

2840
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
And people in Japan have small rooms.

2841
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:26,000
But they also talked about Pearl Jam Rock Band, which actually was announced by Pearl Jam.

2842
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:33,000
But they actually showed concept video of that and how it was going to be about the Pearl Jam live experience.

2843
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Because Pearl Jam is a very active bootlegging culture and live video.

2844
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
So they were actually putting it around their...

2845
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:43,000
And the video in the background was actually going to be video footage from a lot of these concerts.

2846
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Iconic Pearl Jam concerts.

2847
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,000
And it just, for whatever reason, it didn't work out.

2848
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,000
And they then coughed and said, any better.

2849
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
But then they talked about, yes, we know you want Muse.

2850
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:01,000
And they basically kind of explained how something happened and that's why they don't have Muse.

2851
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:08,000
They actually talked about Pink Floyd and actually how they made concept video of doing Dreamscape type of stuff with Pink Floyd tracks.

2852
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,000
The Beatles Pink style stuff.

2853
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:16,000
And they actually had concept art that they sent off to Pink Floyd and it just never happened.

2854
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Same, Led Zeppelin also had a little bit of that.

2855
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
They had some stuff like that.

2856
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
And then they talked about the Guns N' Roses debacle.

2857
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:29,000
And just kind of the highlight of this was where apparently there was a leaked video that came out.

2858
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:35,000
A viral video that went out of an unnamed harmonics employee, which everybody tried to name.

2859
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Saying, hey, we got the entire Guns N' Roses library, Appetite for Destruction, everything.

2860
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
And we're going to do this and this and this and this.

2861
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
And it was a hoax.

2862
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
It was a hoax video, but it was an extremely believable hoax.

2863
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
And it turns out it was by somebody who at the time was just a dumb kid.

2864
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Now he's in the game industry and they're like, should we name him?

2865
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Yeah, we're going to name him.

2866
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Dan Rickert, who was like one of the head guys at Game Informer now.

2867
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Is the person who actually made that video and made harmonics life a living hell.

2868
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Oh my gosh.

2869
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,000
For several months.

2870
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Wow.

2871
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:09,000
So, but of course no news on the future.

2872
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I mean, I know we got the news about American Pie being the last DLC song.

2873
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
That's the big song.

2874
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
But nothing about the future, of course, right?

2875
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:21,000
No, but I did get to, because I do know both Nick Chester and John Drake.

2876
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,000
And I was up to see both of them during the show.

2877
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:28,000
And I didn't ask them what they were working on because I knew they couldn't tell me about that.

2878
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
And I asked them, will I think it's cool?

2879
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,000
And I told them, hey, I've been with you guys since frequency days.

2880
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
And John looked at me and he's like, you will find this cool.

2881
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
You will find what we're doing cool.

2882
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
We're going to announce it.

2883
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
We're hoping to announce it at E3.

2884
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,000
He's like 95% sure.

2885
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
He doesn't want to say anything more than that.

2886
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:49,000
But I told him, yeah, I was with you in the frequency and amplitude days and all that stuff.

2887
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
And he's like, it's not rock band.

2888
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:56,000
But considering what I like of Harmonics' past, he says, I will think that what they're coming up with is cool.

2889
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
And he's very excited about it.

2890
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
And that's all I could get out of him.

2891
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Well, Bobby, it sure sounds like we missed a heck of a show.

2892
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I'm sad, but it is what it is.

2893
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:09,000
But anything else about PAX East you want to share with us?

2894
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:13,000
I got a whole ton of interviews.

2895
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:17,000
I am going to be probably putting them out on my podcast, or some of them on my podcast feed.

2896
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Because if I did one a week, every week, they would go until June.

2897
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Tell us more about Saints Row IV.

2898
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Well, I did see Saints Row IV.

2899
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,000
And I'm going to break this news.

2900
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
I told Rob about this.

2901
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Because now Deep Silver is handling Saints Row IV.

2902
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:39,000
I have a very good relationship with Deep Silver.

2903
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:44,000
So, you know, THQ never gave me the time of day, but Deep Silver did.

2904
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:50,000
And they were showing Saints Row IV to the press in the hotel that's connected to the convention center.

2905
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Instead of having to wait in line.

2906
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:56,000
And also that way they weren't bumping people out of the line, bumping attendees.

2907
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
They had press in a different area.

2908
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:01,000
And so I went in there, and it's the same video.

2909
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
The same ten minute video that they were showing everybody else.

2910
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:07,000
And they had developers in there, and they're like, yeah, interviews and stuff.

2911
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
You know, do interviews.

2912
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
So I went up to our PR contact.

2913
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Her name is Stephanie Shop.

2914
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
She is amazing.

2915
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,000
And I went up, and Stephanie Shop also, if you listen to my show,

2916
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
she was responsible for getting the MechWarrior online, and the Devolver Digital,

2917
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:23,000
and all those interviews, the ones I did kind of in November.

2918
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:26,000
She was responsible for setting all those up.

2919
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:30,000
And I was like, hey, you know, so can I get an interview with one of the Saints Row guys?

2920
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,000
The developers.

2921
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:34,000
And she looked at me and said, no, you can't.

2922
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
And I'm like, okay.

2923
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:40,000
And she's like, because I'd rather you do one of your long form Skype interviews

2924
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
in a couple weeks with them.

2925
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Nice. Very nice.

2926
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Because it would be a five to ten minute quickie interview there,

2927
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:53,000
and she's like, I'd rather you do one of your long form ones with these guys.

2928
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
So you don't have a date yet, though, right?

2929
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
No date.

2930
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Well, because she's heading off to GDC.

2931
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I'm not bugging her until after GDC.

2932
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Sure, sure.

2933
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:06,000
But she said she does want to do it in the next couple weeks, so it could be pretty soon.

2934
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Awesome.

2935
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Well, it sounds like you made a lot of great connections at PAX East.

2936
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:13,000
You had a really good time, making us all jealous we didn't go.

2937
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:17,000
But hey, there's Dragon Con and E3, hopefully.

2938
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,000
You're going to have a great time at Dragon Con.

2939
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
We are going to have a great time at Dragon Con.

2940
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
No, I'm seriously looking forward to it.

2941
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
It's going to be great.

2942
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:26,000
And yeah, I mean, I probably do have more stories.

2943
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:31,000
I saw a lot of other great indie games, some that weren't even on the show floor that I got to see.

2944
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:35,000
And those interviews are going to be airing throughout the next couple weeks,

2945
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:38,000
and we're going to be getting some review copies of those.

2946
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:44,000
And it's a good time to be a gamer. Shut up with the hate.

2947
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Of all the stuff I did, I did not see a single bad game, even looking through all the indie stuff.

2948
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:54,000
I did not see a single bad game.

2949
02:29:54,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Transistor. I think that's the Supergiant games from Bastion.

2950
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
If you want to know what my game of show is.

2951
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,000
That?

2952
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,000
That's it.

2953
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Interesting.

2954
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
That was the last thing I played.

2955
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:12,000
That was the last thing I did before going to the airport was I got to play that game.

2956
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
And it is Bastion in the future with...

2957
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:21,000
It's different enough from Bastion, but you can tell that it's a love of Bastion.

2958
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Logan Cunningham comes back to do the voice, but he's doing a little bit different voice,

2959
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:27,000
and instead of being the narrator, he's actually the voice of your sword.

2960
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:30,000
That's how they work the narration into it.

2961
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
So your sword's constantly talking to you.

2962
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:37,000
And it's not narration, the sword's actually giving you direction and advice.

2963
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:42,000
And you can stop time and queue up actions, and it's all badass and everything.

2964
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:45,000
That probably is my game of show.

2965
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:49,000
SSG100Matt says his girlfriend agrees with you. Transistor's the game of the show.

2966
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Didn't the talking sword thing happen in a Mercedes Lackey novel?

2967
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:55,000
I think it's distant enough that it's alright.

2968
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,000
It actually did.

2969
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
I think it's distant enough that it's alright.

2970
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Well, Bobby, I know you're going to have plenty to say on the next episode of your show.

2971
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I can't imagine there's a person listening to this that doesn't know about your show,

2972
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,000
but just in case, please plug away.

2973
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:12,000
I am the opening band, not the band that you came to see.

2974
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:16,000
But I'll only be here for five or six songs, and then I'll go away.

2975
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:22,000
An hour before O.O.R., 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific on Sunday nights.

2976
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Usually it's me doing a monologue for 30 minutes, taking calls from Break Man for another 20 minutes,

2977
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
and then talking to you guys for 10 minutes.

2978
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:34,000
And that's my show, and we've got a lot of great interviews coming up.

2979
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:41,000
A game book being put into iPad, an old-style 80s game book, Steve Jackson's Sorcery.

2980
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:45,000
It plays like an Infocom text adventure as well, but looks really great.

2981
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
We're going to talk to them.

2982
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:53,000
An iPad brawler that does not use virtual controls, and it plays more like Fruit Ninja,

2983
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
and it actually does work.

2984
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,000
I do get to talk to Phoenix Online Studios with Cognition and the silver lining

2985
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:02,000
in the next game that they're doing with Jane Jensen.

2986
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:07,000
I got to talk to Mommy's Best Games about guns on top of guns and on top of guns.

2987
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Nathan Fouts, he's also been on Fox News a lot recently,

2988
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:13,000
and we talk about why that happened and what he thinks of that.

2989
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:19,000
So there's a lot of great content that I've got in my suitcase that is still locked up

2990
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
and sitting in the hallway because I ran in here.

2991
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
All right, Bobby, go unpack.

2992
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
We're going to let you go so we can get a couple more calls,

2993
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
but thanks so much for spending some time with us tonight.

2994
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,000
No problem, and remember, if Legend of Zaku calls in and he's all like,

2995
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
That's not him.

2996
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
It's really a funny guy.

2997
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
It's an act.

2998
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
It's an act.

2999
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:43,000
All right, Bobby Black Wolf Show calling out the OLR regulars tonight.

3000
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
All right, have a good one, Bobby.

3001
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Take care.

3002
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Take care. Bye.

3003
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
The one and only Bobby Black Wolf, everybody.

3004
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:53,000
We let him go a little long tonight, but you know what?

3005
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I'm excited to hear from some people that were at PAX East.

3006
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:00,000
He always has us on our show, or he always has us on his show.

3007
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,000
It's the least we can do, and he has a lot of great info from the floor.

3008
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I'm hoping we'll get some more PAX East-related calls,

3009
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
like maybe this next one that's coming in right now.

3010
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3011
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Hey, it's Legend of Zaku here.

3012
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Well, were your ears burning?

3013
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Because someone was just talking about you.

3014
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Yeah, I heard it in the car right over.

3015
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:24,000
I heard it right as the car was pulling up to my house.

3016
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
So, Zaku, is it all an act?

3017
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Is this all an act?

3018
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Maybe, but not like sidebar and focus on the real task at hand,

3019
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
which was PAX East.

3020
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:42,000
All right, well, let's talk about the real reason why you called tonight.

3021
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:45,000
PAX East, so you were obviously at the show, too, because you met Bobby.

3022
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,000
How was it?

3023
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
I was rooming with him, actually.

3024
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Were you really? Awesome.

3025
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:54,000
But then it got shifted when we got into the other hotel.

3026
02:33:54,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I'm not going to say as to the reasons why, but he knows it very well,

3027
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
and we'll leave it at that.

3028
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Long story short, this PAX, the way I put it, it was average.

3029
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Last year's PAX, amongst all the swag and the parties, it doesn't hold a candle.

3030
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Case in point, Curse's PAX East party this year wasn't even open bar,

3031
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,000
and they oversold it to the point where you only had one free drink,

3032
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:33,000
and then everything else you had to pay at the cash bar.

3033
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:39,000
The economy is really sons of bitches close to the open bar.

3034
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
That's why I came to this thing.

3035
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
You know what, though? Perfectly legit.

3036
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:49,000
PAX East, not as good, because they closed the open bar this year.

3037
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Fuck them.

3038
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:55,000
That is true, and then it was surprising,

3039
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:59,000
aside from trying my best to play some of these things,

3040
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,000
given the fact that there were lines just about everywhere,

3041
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:05,000
so I only got to play very few things.

3042
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:09,000
I was able to get Hawken to play that game.

3043
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I also tried out the Nvidia Shield, the new handheld controller device that they have,

3044
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:21,000
which is kind of nifty, though, because it's using the latest version of Android.

3045
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:25,000
The latest one that you see on the Nexus 4 and the latest tablets,

3046
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
that's exactly the one they're running.

3047
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:35,000
It really feels like a top-tier device.

3048
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
I'm not just bullshitting or anything.

3049
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:40,000
I'm just saying it also has touchscreen,

3050
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:50,000
but it feels like you're actually playing a recent, current-gen console.

3051
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,000
And the graphics are on par.

3052
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:59,000
They're like 360 graphics from launch titles.

3053
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:09,000
It's gotten to the point where mobile's pretty much at or tailing right now the big-boy consoles.

3054
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:13,000
You talked about a lot of these lines for games.

3055
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Did you wait in any of them?

3056
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Did you stand in that epic line to play DuckTales?

3057
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
No, that's the thing.

3058
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:26,000
I was just going around the con, around the expo hall.

3059
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I did my best to try to score as much free swag as possible,

3060
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
but yeah, it was slim pickings this year.

3061
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:32,000
You're a fan of free stuff.

3062
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:35,000
I wouldn't be able to guess from your talk about the Curse party.

3063
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:41,000
What fun nightlife did these Paxis have? Anything?

3064
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:49,000
I mean, most of the nightlife was either you went to the local bars near the hotels,

3065
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:52,000
which was like the day before the con,

3066
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:57,000
which was a pub crawl that basically stayed in one place because it took too long.

3067
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:01,000
But other than that, it was just like whatever you had in your room,

3068
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
if you had Cards Against Humanity,

3069
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:07,000
you were basically playing not only with your roommates,

3070
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:12,000
but with random strangers that would just bring bottles of high-end liquor,

3071
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:17,000
like Johnny Walker, like a leader Johnny Walker for that table.

3072
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:20,000
And I was like, we're taking big swigs of it.

3073
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:23,000
And as a result, I had to nurse a hangover this morning.

3074
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
I was just about to ask, I was going to say,

3075
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:30,000
your eyes are looking a little bit like you haven't slept in about four days.

3076
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:33,000
No, it's like I puked this morning.

3077
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Yeah.

3078
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I was going to say you have that sort of Prize Fighter look about you.

3079
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Like I wasn't going to say he got in a fight,

3080
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:45,000
but he definitely has that whole like, I had a hell of a weekend,

3081
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:46,000
don't you ask me?

3082
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
My face was just crunching up, tightening up,

3083
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:52,000
because I was lurching over the toilet trying to puke.

3084
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,000
Were you offering your sacrifices to the porcelain goddess?

3085
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Porcelain goddess, yes.

3086
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Sacrificing my dignity.

3087
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:06,000
But aside from the newer games that were out

3088
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:10,000
and the fact that they were just like, you know,

3089
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
aside from the lines and everything else,

3090
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:16,000
board games were pretty much another huge aspect of it.

3091
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:21,000
It got to the point where I actually have gotten my girlfriend.

3092
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:25,000
I know, well, for those who probably can't see the camera, but...

3093
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
That's our weekend.

3094
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Spartacus board game.

3095
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Is that based on the TV show?

3096
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Yes.

3097
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
How much full frontal is in the board game?

3098
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Huh?

3099
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
How much full frontal is in the board game?

3100
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:40,000
None.

3101
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,000
My girlfriend would be disappointed, yeah.

3102
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
That's all she watches it for, full frontal,

3103
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:51,000
and then her dad watches along with her for the boobs.

3104
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:54,000
That's kind of awkward, but all right.

3105
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Yeah, I mean, everywhere, like, yeah, board games,

3106
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:03,000
like, it got to the point where it was like,

3107
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:07,000
at this point, it's like a good third board games,

3108
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:11,000
another third indie, or more importantly,

3109
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:14,000
probably like a quarter indie, and then everything else.

3110
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:15,000
All right, let me ask...

3111
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
I'm still waiting for Mass Effect Risk.

3112
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Let me ask you one more question, Zaku.

3113
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Since you say you weren't as big on PAX East this year

3114
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
as you were, like, last year,

3115
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:26,000
what can PAX 2014 learn from this year?

3116
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:30,000
How can PAX East 2014 set up to be the most kick-ass one yet,

3117
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
besides open bars?

3118
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:39,000
All right, I guess it's the panels that I tried my best

3119
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
to actually go to.

3120
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Like, this year I did better than the fact that I did,

3121
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:47,000
like, one, two, three, four...

3122
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
I think I did, like, six panels,

3123
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
one of which I had to duck out because of my hangover,

3124
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:55,000
but, yeah, it's gotten better.

3125
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
The content has gotten a lot better.

3126
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Obviously, it still packs up pretty badly.

3127
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Like, obviously, the Bioshock panel fills up rather quickly.

3128
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Of course.

3129
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:08,000
But it's just like trying to...

3130
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:11,000
I guess they can't please everybody.

3131
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:14,000
So the best they could do is stay where they are

3132
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
because they have...

3133
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Their venue can handle whatever crowd size

3134
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:21,000
they're throwing in.

3135
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
I wouldn't be surprised if next year

3136
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
it'll be almost, like, 100 grand, 100,000 attendees.

3137
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Oh, my gosh.

3138
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
But then, yeah, that's gonna, like, you're...

3139
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:33,000
It's gonna get to the point where people are just gonna get in the way

3140
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:37,000
and then it's gonna be massive line waiting for, like, you know,

3141
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
for stuff like Watch Dogs,

3142
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
which I heard was a major disappointment over there,

3143
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:46,000
which was showing, like, clips and rehash footage that was already out.

3144
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Oh, that's gotta be irritating.

3145
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,000
You're waiting a big old long line

3146
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:52,000
and then it's just some damn movie you already saw on the internet.

3147
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Square Enix Theater.

3148
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Yeah, right.

3149
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:59,000
The only cool thing about PAX this year was

3150
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
the classic gaming had...

3151
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Well, aside from having the standard setup,

3152
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:07,000
like, one room dedicated to just classic gaming of consoles,

3153
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:08,000
they had another one.

3154
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
They had a featured room.

3155
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
And this year's feature was Steel Battalion.

3156
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Like, they had 12 of these.

3157
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3158
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:19,000
Just playing Steel Battalion is not even fun.

3159
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,000
It's just work.

3160
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:25,000
Start up the next computer.

3161
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Do systems check.

3162
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Next time it needs to come with some vodka.

3163
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:30,000
It'll be a whole lot better.

3164
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,000
Alright.

3165
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls,

3166
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
but thanks so much for the report,

3167
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:39,000
and I'm glad to hear at least you had a decent enough times

3168
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
that you were regretting it this morning.

3169
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Yeah.

3170
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Also, they were giving away free Android Bluetooth controllers.

3171
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Nice.

3172
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:48,000
For Android-owned users.

3173
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Yeah.

3174
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Where's mine?

3175
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Alright.

3176
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Alright, Zaku.

3177
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Gotta let you go, buddy.

3178
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Take care.

3179
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Okay.

3180
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Bye.

3181
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Props to Zaku, an OLR gold store.

3182
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:58,000
A gold store?

3183
02:41:58,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Well, he can have a whole store.

3184
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:02,000
A gold star for Zaku for doing a video call

3185
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
so we can actually see the Spartacus game that he bought.

3186
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Good times.

3187
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Alright, we'll see if anybody else wants to call.

3188
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

3189
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3190
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Making us all jealous we weren't there.

3191
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,000
You alright?

3192
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I just saw something terrifying.

3193
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:18,000
What's that?

3194
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
A goblin shark.

3195
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,000
That does sound terrifying.

3196
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
They have retractable jaws.

3197
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Much less terrifying this next phone call.

3198
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Hi.

3199
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Hello, Olarians.

3200
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Hello, what's up?

3201
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Hi.

3202
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:31,000
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3203
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Who's this?

3204
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:33,000
It's CatastrophicMoggie.

3205
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Hello.

3206
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:35,000
Nice to meet you.

3207
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:36,000
And we even...

3208
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,000
I thought I'd never get through.

3209
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:38,000
You never get through.

3210
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Wow.

3211
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,000
Yay.

3212
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:41,000
Wait.

3213
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Hold on.

3214
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:47,000
The clock on the wall behind you, 3.52 in the morning?

3215
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Yes.

3216
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Oh my.

3217
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:50,000
You told me it was going to stay up for us.

3218
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Wow.

3219
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Yeah, I did say to that was Kara I would.

3220
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:58,000
We usually do our chatting when it's four in the morning for me.

3221
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
And here you are.

3222
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Well, what's up?

3223
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:04,000
I was going to complain about region locking

3224
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:10,000
and how I'm so unexcited by the current news about consoles.

3225
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:13,000
But I thought you've already had so much time.

3226
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
I thought I'd bring up something from weeks ago.

3227
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Sure.

3228
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Go for it.

3229
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:20,000
The last...

3230
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Oh, pardon me.

3231
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Sorry.

3232
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
I'm completely fumbling over my words now.

3233
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:25,000
That's all right.

3234
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,000
I do it all the time.

3235
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:27,000
It's true.

3236
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:28,000
He does.

3237
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Yeah.

3238
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:30,000
We have to listen to three hours of it.

3239
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Hey.

3240
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
I get to make fun of me.

3241
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Me.

3242
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Weeks ago, you were talking, I can't remember what it was about, about your other halves

3243
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
guesting on OLR.

3244
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Was it?

3245
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:49,000
And I thought, your last episode.

3246
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Go on.

3247
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Go on.

3248
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Go.

3249
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:55,000
After your last episode, you should...

3250
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Okay.

3251
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
He's on.

3252
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:58,000
He's on.

3253
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,000
He's on.

3254
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,000
He's on.

3255
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Okay.

3256
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
He's on the internet.

3257
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Yes.

3258
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Where is it?

3259
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,000
It's Fourn and Horning.

3260
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Shh.

3261
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Quiet.

3262
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:12,000
For your last episode, you should have...

3263
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Or for your E3 special, you should have the other half special with Alan, Dan, and...

3264
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Nelly.

3265
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Nelly.

3266
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Pardon.

3267
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Or and with your mum being a guest co-spond.

3268
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:27,000
That would be hilarious.

3269
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:30,000
We've talked about him before, and I'm sure Dan and Alan would be down.

3270
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:35,000
It would just be about convincing Nelly that it's a really funny idea, but that might be

3271
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
difficult.

3272
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Nelly would probably punch my husband.

3273
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:41,000
And then I'd have to be here to see that.

3274
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
You'd have to video it.

3275
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Yes.

3276
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,000
It would have to be a video thing.

3277
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,000
I don't know.

3278
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Maybe the only way I could see that happening is if we promised Nelly it was the last episode

3279
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:56,000
of the show ever, because she'd be like, yay, Matt can have a life now.

3280
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Yeah, you should do it either for the last episode or an E3 special.

3281
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:03,000
We'll see.

3282
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,000
We'll see.

3283
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:07,000
It'd be like we couldn't be bothered to show up, so our spouses do it.

3284
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:11,000
So we've had a bunch of people calling in to talk about PAX East tonight.

3285
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Obviously, you're a little far away, so I'm imagining you didn't make it to PAX East,

3286
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:17,000
but what do you think about everything you're hearing?

3287
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Honestly, I've not heard much news from PAX East.

3288
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Most of what I've heard is from you.

3289
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:28,000
My biggest reaction is I wish DuckTales was coming to PC.

3290
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:29,000
Oh, yeah.

3291
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
They didn't announce it for PC, did they?

3292
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:37,000
I have a policy of not getting digital content on consoles.

3293
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
I can see why.

3294
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:40,000
You know what, though?

3295
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:45,000
One time when it won't transfer over, and at least with physical stuff you can trade

3296
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:48,000
it in with digital stuff, you're stuck with it for now.

3297
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:54,000
If it does well enough, though, they'll put it on disk.

3298
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:58,000
If it's going to be on Xbox, though, it shouldn't be that hard to port it to PC.

3299
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Yeah.

3300
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,000
I hope so.

3301
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Anyway, I take up too much of your time, so I'll get off now.

3302
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:05,000
No worries.

3303
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:09,000
It's a pleasure to hear from you and to get to see you, and I know you've got to shut

3304
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:12,000
up because people are trying to sleep, but thank you for breaking all the rules in your

3305
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
household to call us tonight.

3306
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
I'm getting shouted at.

3307
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:17,000
Bye.

3308
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Bye.

3309
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Bye.

3310
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Bye.

3311
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Bye.

3312
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Bye.

3313
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Bye.

3314
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Bye.

3315
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Bye.

3316
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Bye.

3317
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Bye.

3318
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:28,000
We got someone in trouble.

3319
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:29,000
We got someone in trouble.

3320
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Alright.

3321
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:33,000
One eight seven seven game OLR, or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

3322
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:36,000
That was a great call, though.

3323
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:37,000
It's true, though.

3324
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:41,000
I usually, because I'm up around like four in the morning, and usually that's right when

3325
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:46,000
he's on, so we end up chatting about stuff.

3326
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Bobby and ActDeft in our chat room talking a little bit about the DuckTales on PC thing.

3327
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:55,000
ActDeft was convinced it was coming to PC, and BlackWolf says his sources say it's a

3328
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
possibility eventually.

3329
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,000
Not at launch, though.

3330
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:04,000
I mean, after all, Resident Evil 6 I think just or is about to come out on Steam.

3331
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Sometimes PC's a little bit later, so just hold out.

3332
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Just hold out, guys.

3333
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,000
It might happen.

3334
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3335
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:11,000
Who's this?

3336
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Hey, hey, hey.

3337
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:15,000
It's Anime Jam Session calling live from the Mobile Jersey Mobile.

3338
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Holy crap.

3339
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:17,000
It's all you guys.

3340
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:18,000
I hope you're not driving.

3341
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:19,000
No, I'm driving.

3342
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Okay.

3343
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Okay.

3344
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:27,000
I was going to say, because if Ron shouldn't have been the one driving, we would have hung

3345
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:28,000
up.

3346
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Just because you do not talk on your phone and drive.

3347
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,000
I do it all the time.

3348
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Don't listen to me.

3349
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Yeah, and you're going to kill somebody, namely a turkey.

3350
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:35,000
No, I'm not.

3351
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
No, I'm not.

3352
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:37,000
What?

3353
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:38,000
All right.

3354
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Enough of Dark Soccer's lecturing.

3355
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
You guys are coming back from PAX East.

3356
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Did you have a good time?

3357
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Yes, yes, yes, and I would like to let you know that as Executive Vice Chair of VOGCON

3358
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:56,000
East 2013, we went over attendance capacity with the special guest of Cards Against Humanity.

3359
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:03,000
We went to a total of 16 guests with special guest stars Johnny Walker Red.

3360
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Now, wait a minute.

3361
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:09,000
We've had two other callers so far tonight from VOG at PAX East.

3362
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
You're the first one to mention this con.

3363
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
What exactly ended up happening?

3364
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Hello?

3365
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Are we losing them?

3366
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,000
What was that?

3367
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
We're kind of breaking in and out here.

3368
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,000
That's okay.

3369
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:25,000
We're breaking in and out here.

3370
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:28,000
What ended up happening at this VOGCON?

3371
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Let's see.

3372
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Jovay Dea did Alcohol Bingo.

3373
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:43,000
Zaku went game over because he drank not as much as everybody else.

3374
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:49,000
And we did game plus inception equals game-ception.

3375
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
You don't say?

3376
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Yes.

3377
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Yeah, we were playing a dice game.

3378
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:01,000
The rules of the game were roll dice, make up rule, drink.

3379
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Those were the rules of the game.

3380
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Yes.

3381
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Patent pending.

3382
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:11,000
The name of the game is called game.

3383
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:18,000
How many minutes were you sober during PAX East?

3384
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Too stupid.

3385
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
More or less, yeah.

3386
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:22,000
All right.

3387
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:25,000
What did you guys see on the show floor that kicked ass?

3388
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Did you see anything out there?

3389
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Or even if it wasn't on the show floor, like in a side room or a panel or whatever,

3390
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
what did you see that kicked ass?

3391
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
DuckTales.

3392
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Did you actually wait in that hideous line to play it or did you just run up and-

3393
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Hell no!

3394
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:44,000
No, DuckTales is one of those games where I will be buying it regardless.

3395
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Yeah, that's true.

3396
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
You don't need a demo to sell you, huh?

3397
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Nope.

3398
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:52,000
I will say this though.

3399
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Twitch TV was having a giveaway for the DuckTales poster.

3400
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:59,000
They wanted people to sing the DuckTales theme.

3401
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:02,000
So me, my brother, and Jove were there.

3402
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
I tried to get Jove to sing.

3403
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Yeah, right.

3404
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:10,000
I went up there with my bro, and the camera was on us, and after we sang the song,

3405
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
dude in the booth's like,

3406
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
yeah, give the dude with the Vox shirt a poster,

3407
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,000
because he actually sang the words.

3408
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Nice.

3409
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Way to- good job name checking the station too.

3410
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
It's always a good thing.

3411
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,000
We love-

3412
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Well, we got-

3413
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Well, we got to thank Ukchon for that because of how big the VOG logo is on our shirts.

3414
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Mm-hmm.

3415
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Good job.

3416
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Well, I know you guys are on your way home, and you got to get there safe and everything,

3417
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:43,000
but since you guys are going to be talking about this undoubtedly on Anime Jam Session this Tuesday,

3418
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
what do we have to look forward to?

3419
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Our complete review, a whole lot of stuff.

3420
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
But before we go, a couple of things.

3421
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Another game that's worth picking up is Lego City Undercover.

3422
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Really?

3423
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Yes. Are you a fan of the Shawshank Redemption?

3424
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Yes.

3425
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:08,000
The game has a lot of pop culture references, including a scene from the Shawshank Redemption.

3426
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,000
That's kind of random in a Lego game.

3427
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,000
It's a prison break.

3428
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Basically, you have to go undercover into a prison and talk to one of the characters.

3429
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
The character's name is Blue.

3430
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Okay, okay.

3431
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:27,000
And you come to pick, and he starts talking like Morgan Freeman.

3432
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:33,000
And some of the stuff he says, I was kind of hearing it.

3433
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
I'm like, why do I know this?

3434
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:38,000
And then he said something, and I'm like, Blue.

3435
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:41,000
I'm like, aw, crap! It's Shawshank!

3436
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
I love games that do that, though.

3437
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Actually, Shane was just showing me a screenshot earlier from the new Pokémon game that came out.

3438
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Earlier today, actually.

3439
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:54,000
And what was the line here in this?

3440
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Hold on, I'm bringing it up right now.

3441
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:59,000
I want to do this justice, because it's a great reference.

3442
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Especially if you're Grandpa from Hoard House.

3443
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:06,000
One of the characters saying, you can call me Swanna if you want.

3444
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Just don't call me maybe.

3445
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:13,000
That was bad.

3446
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Just as bad as the Nvidia Shield Controller.

3447
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Oh, was that on the show floor?

3448
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Yes, I played it. The controls were...

3449
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
The controlling was weak.

3450
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:30,000
The outline for doing the directional cross was really bad.

3451
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:34,000
And the demo game was Sonic 4.

3452
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:39,000
And when the song would end, it would pause for a half second and replay the track again.

3453
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:40,000
I'm like, yeah, no.

3454
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Oh, lord.

3455
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:45,000
You know, Bobby was not a big fan of the Ouya Controller.

3456
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Did you get to see that in comparison to the Nvidia one?

3457
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Ah, I did not know the Ouya was on display.

3458
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:53,000
I did not know.

3459
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:56,000
There's not enough time to see everything at one PAX.

3460
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
It doesn't matter, I'll be getting in like a week.

3461
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Alright.

3462
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:01,000
Um, okay.

3463
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
I gotta let you know, guys, so we can go wrap up the show.

3464
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
But any other last thoughts on PAX?

3465
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Get your butts out here for 2014 so we can do VOGCON 2014.

3466
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:17,000
And unfortunately for ActDeaf, since he's a staffer, he does tech.

3467
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:21,000
He'll be staffing the con for all three days, so by the time he gets off a shift,

3468
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
all the fun stuff's already happened.

3469
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Womp womp.

3470
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:30,000
Uh, you know, though, VOGCON 2013 is DragonCon,

3471
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
and you got to Atlanta for one con this year,

3472
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:35,000
so I expect you're gonna be able to make it twice.

3473
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Well, look at it this way.

3474
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:41,000
If I graduate from college and I get those marks and I land the job,

3475
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:44,000
we'll be partying our fabulous little asses off.

3476
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
Awesome. We can play game.

3477
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:49,000
Yes!

3478
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
I challenge you to game.

3479
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:56,000
That's not a challenge. That's a fun thing to do.

3480
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:59,000
And you have to do it in deep Russian voices.

3481
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Oh, okay.

3482
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,000
You know what, though?

3483
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:04,000
It has to be better than what we did at Fonami,

3484
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:08,000
which was just the one bottle of Malibu and us going all over the place looking for a soda.

3485
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
How about this for the tagline?

3486
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:13,000
In Soviet Russia, game play you!

3487
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:15,000
That was it.

3488
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:19,000
And Ookchan, if we're going to do that, Jovideh will be there with our kinky vodka.

3489
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
Oh my god, the kinky vodka was so good.

3490
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Alright, I'm getting drunk off this conversation.

3491
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Rama, I gotta let you go.

3492
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Take care, you guys.

3493
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Big hug to all you guys at Anime Jam Session, Jovideh and whoever else might be with you.

3494
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Um, take care, guys, okay?

3495
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:34,000
You got it. Thank you.

3496
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Bye!

3497
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Love it.

3498
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Alright, guys, sadly it is time I shut down the Skype line.

3499
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
We have been taking Skype calls for about 40 minutes, you know.

3500
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:43,000
But most of it was Bobby.

3501
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
Well, yes, but, you know, with good reason.

3502
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:49,000
But we had a lot from Zaku and Magi and, you know, Rama as well, so.

3503
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Appreciate everybody who called.

3504
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
If you didn't get through tonight but you have something to say,

3505
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:54,000
for the love of god, email us.

3506
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:57,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

3507
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
Give Dark Sakura some work to do next week.

3508
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:05,000
In the meantime, some quick Twitter topics before I go for last minute stories.

3509
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:11,000
TigerClaw305 wants to remind us that XCOM Enemy Unknown was announced for iOS.

3510
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
I forgot about this but I did hear about this.

3511
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:17,000
They're talking about they're going to be charging probably a little more money for it.

3512
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
It's not going to be a 99 cent game.

3513
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Think more along like the lines of a $15 game.

3514
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:26,000
But that would be in line with Squeenix pricing on iOS so it would make a lot of sense.

3515
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:31,000
But, yeah, they say it's going to be just like you're playing it on PC or any of those.

3516
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:35,000
I mean, XCOM makes sense to be on iPad.

3517
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,000
It would work.

3518
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
iPhone would be a little too tiny.

3519
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:39,000
I don't know about that one.

3520
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
Even iPad Mini might be a little much.

3521
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:42,000
I don't know.

3522
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Dartusuya wanted to follow up on the rapid fire news.

3523
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:52,000
If you bought La Mulana on Playism or Desura, you will get a Steam key after April 15th.

3524
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:55,000
So some of you already are going to own this new La Mulana.

3525
02:55:55,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Also, for next week, since we're so close to 500 and with all the old school talk,

3526
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:03,000
can we air Best Hits Part 1 next week?

3527
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Maybe.

3528
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:06,000
We'll see.

3529
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:07,000
I don't want to promise anything yet.

3530
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
You never know what we might come up with.

3531
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:15,000
And ActDeft also posted a story about Dust and Elysian Tail that was covered in our rapid fire news earlier.

3532
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Must have been in the restroom when we went over that.

3533
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:22,000
But I will say this story does say that a sequel may be in the works.

3534
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:23,000
Which, you know, game does well.

3535
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Sequel comes out.

3536
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
That's no big surprise there.

3537
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us there and tweet us for a future week.

3538
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Last minute stories tonight.

3539
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Loki.

3540
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:34,000
This is kind of cool.

3541
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:41,000
They have put together this project called The Unleashed Project.

3542
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:47,000
And what it is is a total conversion for Sonic Generations that's Sonic Unleashed.

3543
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Sonic Unleashed has been ported to PC completely.

3544
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
And it runs better than it did on console.

3545
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:55,000
Nice.

3546
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:59,000
Because they're using the Generations engine.

3547
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:08,000
And Unleashed, I'm talking about all the actual non-werewolf, werehog levels.

3548
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:11,000
We're talking about all the good levels.

3549
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:12,000
All the good ones.

3550
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Nice.

3551
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:16,000
Alright, that's it?

3552
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Yeah, that's it.

3553
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Alright, that's it.

3554
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Well, that's going to wrap us up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3555
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
This episode's going to have to suit you for two weeks.

3556
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:29,000
But, you know, we've got an archive of about 497 episodes before this one.

3557
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:32,000
So, if you need something to hold you over next week, go back and grab it.

3558
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:39,000
All the podcasts are still on our server back through about 320.

3559
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
So, there's plenty that are on the feed to grab.

3560
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:45,000
If you need something before that, hit up Dark Tetsuya who's in our chat room.

3561
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:51,000
He's got the link to the O-L archive where they dug up fucking episodes of Vanilla Sky.

3562
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
And Guys on a Show.

3563
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:56,000
They probably have your music show you used to do.

3564
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Somebody probably recorded that.

3565
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Which was all like, if I had to go out and run errands, I'd just put on Eddie Izzard.

3566
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:07,000
People used to bootleg the shit out of Orange Lounge Radio, the station.

3567
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Now, all this time later, it's awesome that they did that, really.

3568
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:15,000
I am also planning this Wednesday to be in Turntable.

3569
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Ah, I miss Turntable. Good times.

3570
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Doing, basically, what I used to do on my Pump of the Volume.

3571
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
That's awesome. I miss Turntable. I always forget there.

3572
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Should we pop in there with me, Rob?

3573
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
I very well might. Just let me know what night.

3574
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
As long as it isn't when, what's the night?

3575
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:31,000
It's still Wednesday.

3576
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Oh, Wednesday is Hoard House.

3577
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:33,000
I'm doing it after Hoard House.

3578
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:34,000
Okay, after Hoard House is fine.

3579
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:38,000
This week is actually, I need to give this a shout out, Hoard House episode 100 is this Wednesday.

3580
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:39,000
Nice.

3581
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Yeah, big milestone.

3582
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Milestone.

3583
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Giveaways on this week's show.

3584
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Give me some interest in WoW.

3585
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
You've got the secret world, ain't it?

3586
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Oh, you know, I got it because it was on sale for 22 bucks instead of the full 30, so.

3587
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:54,000
I don't blame you.

3588
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Yeah.

3589
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:56,000
Check it out.

3590
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:57,000
All right.

3591
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:58,000
And I got yelled at for spending money.

3592
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Well, that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

3593
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:05,000
We just want to thank you guys for tuning in, supporting independent radio.

3594
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:09,000
You know, we just do this because, you know, somebody brought this up before,

3595
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:12,000
just kind of the whole talk about, like, you know, the family.

3596
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:15,000
And that really is, you guys that are so enthusiastic about this show,

3597
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:21,000
there may not be 10,000 of you, but even like the fact that there's five of you

3598
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:24,000
makes like this so worth doing week in and week out.

3599
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:28,000
And as we are coming up on episode 500 has really made it worth it

3600
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:31,000
and why we've been stuck with it for so long.

3601
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
We don't charge for the show.

3602
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:38,000
We're not going to be asking you for twelve thousand dollars to do this here in person.

3603
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
But I am every other week.

3604
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
I am working on a gift for our listeners, though.

3605
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:43,000
What's that?

3606
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:44,000
We talked about it earlier.

3607
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
Oh, yeah. She's not in a future way.

3608
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:50,000
But I just wanted to say, fortunately, though, we have to raise the limit of friends.

3609
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:53,000
You have to or the minimum of friends you have to ask.

3610
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
You have to tell 500 of your friends.

3611
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:56,000
That's right. That's right.

3612
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
You're going to have to tell way more your friends.

3613
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
We have conventions we want to go to.

3614
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
We don't charge you guys to listen to this show.

3615
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:08,000
I can tell you it does not take ten thousand dollars to put on this show.

3616
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:14,000
It takes passion and dedication and wanting to do it for the loyal listeners.

3617
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:17,000
And that is what we get out of it.

3618
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:20,000
And so all we ask is help us grow our family.

3619
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:23,000
Spread the word about the show. Tell a friend or two about it.

3620
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:26,000
Give us a thumbs up on Stitcher.

3621
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:30,000
And if you're on Tumblr, reblog when I freaking post it and not just hit like.

3622
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:33,000
Jamie is just here for her tumbles and wanting more followers.

3623
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:34,000
No, I'm not.

3624
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:39,000
I've been I've figured since I've been using my Tumblr to promote the show.

3625
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:43,000
I'm also using my Mass Effect Tumblr to promote the show.

3626
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
So don't give me that, Rob. All right.

3627
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
That does it. Thank you, guys.

3628
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:50,000
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought for these two weeks.

3629
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
And then we'll be back on April 7th.

3630
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
Dark soccer. Your final thought tonight.

3631
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
I have a headache. Stupid sinus infection.

3632
03:00:56,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Sorry. My final thought is hazelnut frappuccinos.

3633
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Pretty good. I'm going to go get one.

3634
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
Pretty good. Is that Starbucks on the way?

3635
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Any of them. It's all I use the app.

3636
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:10,000
The app will tell you when I have the app.

3637
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:13,000
You can go for me. Get with the time.

3638
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
Last but not least, it's a grind. Hello, Loki.

3639
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:19,000
Your final thought. You know, I'm not a huge fan of these games.

3640
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:24,000
It's really unfair that there's a Beatmania third mix final.

3641
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:30,000
And I'm sorry, Beatmania three final and a keyboard third mix or keyboard

3642
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:33,000
being a third mix in Sacramento.

3643
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:37,000
They want one hundred dollars for both Rob.

3644
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:40,000
Do you see what the price of Beatmania and you take the keyboard mania?

3645
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Where am I going to put a keyboard mania in this house? In my backyard.

3646
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:46,000
If you if you can hold on to the other machine for me until we get a house,

3647
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:49,000
then yes, I'll do it. I thought to Dan. All right.

3648
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:52,000
But it's someone's already been on it. So on one of them.

3649
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:56,000
So you got to outbid them. But I mean, the concept ninety nine dollars.

3650
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:59,000
We'll do we can. All right. That's it.

3651
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Have a great week, everybody. Be safe. Don't be a dick online.

3652
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:06,000
I know you guys won't be. And I hope all you guys had a blast.

3653
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
It packs and have fun. A game developers conference.

3654
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:12,000
If you're one of those guys to go into that picture didn't happen.

3655
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
And we'll see you back here in a couple of weeks on orange launch radio.

3656
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Episode four ninety nine. When we come back on April 7th.

3657
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
Have a great week, everybody. Good night.

3658
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:24,000
