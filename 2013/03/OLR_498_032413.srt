1
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:12,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Sky, and Loku.

2
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:17,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Tonight, March 24th, 2013, new games are shown at PAX East.

3
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Wii U shop age restrictions are lifted in Europe.

4
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:23,924
[SPEAKER_12]: And could an exploit in Origin allow malicious code on your PC?

5
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,014
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

6
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:57,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm eating something evil thanks to Loki.

7
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And I totally stole her joke.

8
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,110
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was funny.

9
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:01,031
[SPEAKER_17]: You bitch.

10
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:01,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

11
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:03,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, here's a quarter for that joke.

12
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:05,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a cup of coffee for that joke.

13
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:06,474
[SPEAKER_17]: I love this coffee.

14
00:01:06,514 --> 00:01:07,355
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very delicious.

15
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:08,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

16
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

17
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:12,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I ate so many breadsticks that my head hurts now.

18
00:01:13,058 --> 00:01:16,480
[SPEAKER_08]: who's bringing the food, supplying OLR Studios with breadsticks.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I ate most of it.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just I couldn't finish the last two.

21
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:20,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, ten was enough.

22
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:25,784
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys didn't know this, but every week at OLR is a potluck, you know, where everybody brings a dish.

23
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:29,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I bring the coffee, which is funny because Loki doesn't drink coffee.

24
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:32,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki brings the pizza and breadsticks, and DarkSakura brings...

25
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:34,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Healthy stuff.

26
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:35,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Gross.

27
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Salad and Chinese food.

28
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:37,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Who wants that?

29
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Chinese food isn't that healthy.

30
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I bring you coffee sometimes.

31
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,752
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends what you get at Chinese food, right?

32
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:42,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Depends what you get.

33
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:47,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Panda and I had the mandarin chicken with no sauce over vegetables and fried rice.

34
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:49,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Delicious.

35
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:54,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're not a food show, believe it or not, but we are a show about video games.

36
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:59,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure PAX East, on a lot of your minds, we're going to be talking about some of the news that came out of PAX East.

37
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, I didn't get a chance to go this year.

38
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,811
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to PAX East the very first year, which was I think 2010, right?

39
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:06,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to PAX East that year.

40
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:07,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a great time.

41
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, it's a little tricky to get out to Boston from here.

42
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:13,334
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a bit of a plane trip.

43
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,556
[SPEAKER_08]: And just with my day job and everything, there was no way I was going to get out there this year.

44
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:24,119
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll tell you what, y'all made me jealous through your Twitter updates and your forum posts and all that stuff I was watching.

45
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all made me jealous I wasn't at PAX East.

46
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,241
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:59,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, Orange Lounge Radio does tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or VOGnetwork.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

48
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:04,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Not tonight, though, because Bobby is one of those folks that was at PAX East, and he's on a plane home right now.

49
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Bobby.

50
00:03:05,258 --> 00:03:06,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is now the Mass Effect show.

51
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,942
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the entire group from Anime Jam Session was there.

52
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Ranma, Geovidea, R.A.

53
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:15,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Rockefeller, they were all there.

54
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:18,507
[SPEAKER_08]: And Critical Myth, I know, was there.

55
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

56
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:22,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to think who else from VOG shows.

57
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:28,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was it from the show shows, because obviously the gals from Britain didn't come out for it, and British Invaders.

58
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:29,836
[SPEAKER_08]: One's in Canada, one's in Britain.

59
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:31,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they went out for it either.

60
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:34,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but certainly a lot of shows.

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So they'll be giving you some updates throughout the week.

62
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:39,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping some of our regulars, because a lot of our regulars were there.

63
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:42,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Misty was there, Matt was there, Ranma was there.

64
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:47,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping to get some calls from people a little later on tonight to talk about PAX East and all that good stuff.

65
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:48,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

66
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:50,095
[SPEAKER_08]: For now though, we weren't there.

67
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,356
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get into the big news that came out of PAX East in a little bit.

68
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:55,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to ask because this is what I ask every time there's a PAX.

69
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:58,160
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the Megafon event this year?

70
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I was watching... The final... I was watching Seg's Twitter and he posted it and I forgot already.

71
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:07,145
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't sound like a new game or anything to me.

72
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:09,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe somebody in chat can help us out there.

73
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:12,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Live.VogNetwork.com is our chatroom.

74
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:17,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And ActDeft in our chatroom live tonight confirming, yes, Critical Myth, AJS, and Bobby Black were all there.

75
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:18,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

76
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:19,793
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

77
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:36,095
[SPEAKER_08]: We were kind of looking back because what was it?

78
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:37,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody joined chat.

79
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,297
[SPEAKER_08]: What's this guy's name?

80
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:39,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Catastrophic Moggy joined chat.

81
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:40,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

82
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:44,782
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was getting that name confused in my head with a guy that used to be here locally that was Moogle Hunter.

83
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:45,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was his name or something like that.

84
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:46,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

85
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:49,246
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were talking about all these people from I'm talking like the

86
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:50,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Old School OLR Days

87
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:20,500
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's my little request for what it's worth.

88
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And another old school person is in the mailbag tonight.

89
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:25,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know we're going to get to that later.

90
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:31,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I would really love to hear from some of these really old school people that used to be on the show a long time ago.

91
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:38,990
[SPEAKER_08]: My house is open to you all that can make it on April 14th, which is the big show.

92
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring me birthday presents.

93
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,352
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

94
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so y'all know, no show next week.

95
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:44,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm registered.

96
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:45,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Easter.

97
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:48,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Episode 499 is April 7th.

98
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:50,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that right?

99
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:50,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, April 7th.

100
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And then episode 500 is April 14th.

101
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:57,405
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would really love for the old school people to show up.

102
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:02,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to see Anita, who I know is a DDR angel, if she can make it.

103
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:04,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Just some of the old school people would crack me up.

104
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I chatted with her on Steam the other day.

105
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:06,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?

106
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:06,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice.

107
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:10,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I see her hubby on Google Plus all the time.

108
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:11,474
[SPEAKER_02]: He put out an Android game.

109
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:13,754
[SPEAKER_02]: We sometimes exchange recipes and things too.

110
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:17,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know she runs a blog now and all that.

111
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:18,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Her blog is awesome.

112
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:19,475
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called The Eco Maker.

113
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:22,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who wants good home stuff, check it out.

114
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:23,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Space Team.

115
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:25,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Space Team.

116
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:27,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that an old school game?

117
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:29,977
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a new Android mobile game.

118
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:33,558
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cooperative team game or something.

119
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:34,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

120
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:41,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard a girl won, which is interesting because it was not Pork Buns who was on the show last week, two weeks ago.

121
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,817
[SPEAKER_08]: The gal we had on the show last week, sadly, she got eliminated the first round in Bomberman.

122
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:47,979
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the curse of coming on OLR.

123
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember trying to register that as an address Oh really?

124
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,622
[SPEAKER_02]: and why I had to get Sackbimani instead.

125
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:17,564
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who I know?

126
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some Catholic organization registered it.

127
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:21,890
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who I know would come?

128
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:22,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Who?

129
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:25,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And who I am friends with on Facebook and I literally haven't seen.

130
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:26,117
[SPEAKER_08]: We just keep in touch on Facebook.

131
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:26,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Miss Janae.

132
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,402
[SPEAKER_08]: And she married Dark Child.

133
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:29,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know that?

134
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and she has a little one.

135
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:32,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they had a baby.

136
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:33,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

137
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:34,745
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is so fucking old.

138
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:36,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a baby.

139
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:37,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a cat.

140
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:39,568
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a lot better than a baby.

141
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:40,429
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a cat too.

142
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:41,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I love kitties.

143
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,571
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't drool on me.

144
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:44,052
[SPEAKER_02]: However, she does chew on cords.

145
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:46,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki has a baby, but well, not even a baby anymore.

146
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:47,474
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a toddler.

147
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,155
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys went bowling the other day, right?

148
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,216
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a small person.

149
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:51,437
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like almost three.

150
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:52,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.

151
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:54,339
[SPEAKER_08]: The video was adorable though, the bowling.

152
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:54,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys have fun?

153
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:55,840
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a short video.

154
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the long video, yeah.

155
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:03,662
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't let us bowl, because we have the little ramp thing, because he can't carry the ball.

156
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:14,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the lightest ball is like six pounds, and he might be able to carry that, but I'm not going to have him carry a big ball that's got the oil from the lane on it and stuff with his feet.

157
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:15,645
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not a good idea.

158
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:21,507
[SPEAKER_05]: So he had fun just pushing it down the little ramp so that it would knock stuff over, but he wouldn't let us have a turn.

159
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:37,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I managed to bowl twice and my wife once and he bowled like two whole games worth of turns for three people Catastrophic Moggy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says What is this?

160
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:40,300
[SPEAKER_08]: A show about gaming or a trip down memory lane?

161
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm sure that comment is tongue in cheek and you don't really mean anything negative by it but you know what?

162
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:49,867
[SPEAKER_08]: When you've been gaming with the same crowd for so long and you know

163
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:54,408
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys have to remember when we did the DDR stuff, we were really heavy into Dance Dance Revolution.

164
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,689
[SPEAKER_08]: We would meet at the arcade every Wednesday.

165
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:57,569
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like clockwork.

166
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Every Wednesday or whatever day it was at the time, we'd go, we'd play some DDR for a few hours.

167
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:04,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we'd go and have dinner, sit down.

168
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,673
[SPEAKER_08]: You kind of build up a little bit of a family.

169
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,233
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, you know what?

170
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:10,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a little more than just video games.

171
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:11,894
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about family.

172
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:13,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on my second cat.

173
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:16,656
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of sane people turn up here and chat every week.

174
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:17,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on my second cat.

175
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:18,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

176
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,237
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been through a lot.

177
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Memory, all alone in your life

178
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:47,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I played Mass Effect because I've got the high-res mod working on Mass Effect 3.

179
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,754
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Oliver.

180
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:50,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

181
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:51,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

182
00:09:51,995 --> 00:09:52,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

183
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

184
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:58,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Mass Effect 3, got the high-res mod working, and then it started crashing whenever I would do...

185
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:04,221
[SPEAKER_02]: The Tango, and I figured out that the problem was my Coalesce INI was what was doing it to me.

186
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:16,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I had everything set by the old version of the Hi-Rez mod, and the new version doesn't require you to change any of your texture settings in the Coalesce file.

187
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:19,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and used my old Coalesce file, everything worked fine.

188
00:10:20,314 --> 00:10:24,197
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem that I have with it is that it makes all of James' textures black.

189
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:26,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Tango down, tango down.

190
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:44,827
[SPEAKER_02]: The cool thing about this mod is that one of the textures that comes with it is one where you can sort of see Tali's face through her mask.

191
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:51,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's got the extra little bits they photoshopped on that one picture in Mass Effect 3 if you happen to be romancing her.

192
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it was a neat touch.

193
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:55,454
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got little bits on her eyebrows.

194
00:10:56,334 --> 00:11:04,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I also played some Mass Effect 2, which I have now figured out how to use Ashley's skin and hair, except with a completely different face structure so it doesn't quite look like Ashley.

195
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm using Warren's outfit.

196
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been playing around a little bit.

197
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:11,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten the game to crash once.

198
00:11:11,702 --> 00:11:12,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I was proud of myself.

199
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:33,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, I'm not doing the Fandango Actdeft Um, I also started The Secret World And the problem is that I've had a sinus infection all week As I've said on a previous episode This time of year, sinus infections Like you wouldn't believe, allergies all over the place

200
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:56,341
[SPEAKER_02]: and um so I got through like the very beginning of the uh Templar uh scenario and then I was like oh my god gunfire my head hurts I can't look at this anymore so um Secret World's that MMO I remember playing this too in beta is it totally free now or is it yeah like Guild Wars model

201
00:11:56,767 --> 00:12:00,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's... You can pay a subscription and get all the premium shit.

202
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,451
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy a few things here and there.

203
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:04,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have the completely freebie model.

204
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:05,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's okay.

205
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:08,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of... I mean, I haven't gotten too much into it.

206
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:09,696
[SPEAKER_02]: The controls are alright.

207
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:15,260
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did sign up for the next Final Fantasy XIV beta.

208
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully that'll work out for me.

209
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't cancelled WoW yet.

210
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:24,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I think I am, I was like, Oh, but I'll miss everybody.

211
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:25,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Weh.

212
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a tip on that Final Fantasy XIV beta, though.

213
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:32,453
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do get in, it's under NDA, and you're not even supposed to say if you're in the beta.

214
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:44,695
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, trust me, it would be a real shame if you got in the beta of Final Fantasy XIV, you couldn't talk about it on this show, even though you very much wanted to talk about everything that you were seeing in the beta.

215
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,516
[SPEAKER_08]: But you couldn't do that if you're under NDA.

216
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:51,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Trust me, I've heard from very close, very respected, very handsome sources.

217
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:53,957
[SPEAKER_02]: All I said is that I applied for it.

218
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:59,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I applied and said yeah, I own every single one of these consoles that's on this list.

219
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,260
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your point?

220
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for the 3DS and the Vita.

221
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:04,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I own the good consoles on that list.

222
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:07,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, the Vita and the 3DS are cool.

223
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:15,722
[SPEAKER_02]: and God, I started playing, I was going to play Mirror's Edge and Dan's like, you're going to throw up, you're going to get sick, don't play it, you're going to get sick, you're going to get sick.

224
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:16,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, fine, I'm going to play it.

225
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:19,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the show is on whoever you are, VOG 155.

226
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:24,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about your week, don't re-chat.

227
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:25,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, shit.

228
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:28,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I played Mass Effect 3, shut up, Rageinator.

229
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:31,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

230
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:34,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

231
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:36,981
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

232
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:38,342
[SPEAKER_08]: See, they derail you.

233
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:41,583
[SPEAKER_08]: When you go to look at chat window, you've been saying it derails you.

234
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:51,647
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just most of the time, I didn't really have much of an energy to play much of anything just because I was on so many damn sinus medicines.

235
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:59,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on Dayquil, Sudafed, Benadryl, and Allegra in various doses, and then NyQuil.

236
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, get better, damn it.

237
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:02,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel much better today.

238
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:05,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just my nose feels like it's the Sahara.

239
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft is asking about Mirror's Edge.

240
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that something you were supposed to start this week?

241
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:11,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I was going to start this week was Mirror's Edge.

242
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:14,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the one that Dan says, you're going to get sick.

243
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:17,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine, I'm going to get sick.

244
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:18,403
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty though.

245
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm gonna play it.

246
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:25,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to wait until... Because the other problem is that all this week I've had bad equilibrium issues.

247
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:29,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if I've made it evident to our lovely listeners yet.

248
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:31,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started drawing again.

249
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:37,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually rearranged the vault slash computer room to where I have my... Your old desk, pretty much.

250
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:38,422
[SPEAKER_02]: The table.

251
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:40,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is my drawing surface.

252
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,866
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've actually been dedicating quite a bit of time to rebuilding lost skills.

253
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:46,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

254
00:14:47,868 --> 00:15:01,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been, but I've been trying to, when I play a game, if I'm pausing at a point in it, I'm actually starting to sketch out what's on my screen just to sort of help me with proportion and space and distance and that type of thing.

255
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:10,868
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a pretty interesting exercise, but I figured my first love has been video games and art, so why not?

256
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:12,289
[SPEAKER_08]: And your second love is Garrus.

257
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:15,123
[SPEAKER_02]: My second love is Dan.

258
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:15,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Garrus is third.

259
00:15:16,344 --> 00:15:17,625
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

260
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:19,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your... Oh, followed by The Guardian Legend.

261
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

262
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:23,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

263
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Gary's Mod this week.

264
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:29,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually bought that on their little Steam sale that they have for some indie stuff.

265
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:30,535
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only three bucks.

266
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:40,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was trying to get to work with the game, you know, the Xbox 360 controller, and it's a little awkward because they don't have the keys mapped out quite correctly.

267
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So I couldn't really do a whole ton...

268
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:50,106
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I kept losing my gravity gun, which was kind of annoying because I can't arrange stuff without that.

269
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:55,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And so basically all I was able to do was throw a large iron beam in the air and crush myself with it.

270
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:57,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that was kind of boring.

271
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:05,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, I went and tried to... Well, that kind of prompted me to look into some other games that supported controllers.

272
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had Cave Story Plus, which I knew that supported controllers, but for some reason I couldn't find...

273
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:15,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't look, I guess, for the options for the controller support.

274
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:17,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I found it, and so I started playing that.

275
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:19,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm enjoying that quite a bit.

276
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:28,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I also played more Saints Row the Third, both on PC and Xbox 360.

277
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And going through, grinding through the activities, man.

278
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:34,743
[SPEAKER_05]: There's...

279
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:39,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope the next game doesn't do that.

280
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, let me introduce you to these activities that you've played before.

281
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:43,907
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't do that in the second game.

282
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:45,267
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't even do that in the first game.

283
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,488
[SPEAKER_05]: They just had the activities there.

284
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:55,832
[SPEAKER_05]: But the third game, half the missions are just like, hey, you have to do this activity for this reason, even though it doesn't really quite apply to the game.

285
00:16:56,952 --> 00:17:01,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Before Saints Row 2 and 1, it was drug trafficking.

286
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:04,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's merchandise trafficking.

287
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:05,076
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like,

288
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:05,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

289
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:06,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

290
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:14,500
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are like, you know, big time gangsters now and we're trafficking merchandise like, you know, bobbleheads and shit.

291
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,601
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of stupid.

292
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:18,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, oh, hey, um...

293
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:21,644
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't even go along with that.

294
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:24,967
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an escort mission where you have to escort them with a chopper.

295
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:27,329
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Guardian Angel is what it's called.

296
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Half the time, you're firing rockets out of the side of a helicopter.

297
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:40,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other time, you're, for some reason, repelled down the side of a building and sniping.

298
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,741
[SPEAKER_05]: You could snipe on top of the building.

299
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:47,125
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to repel down the building a little bit for some damn reason to snipe.

300
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:48,506
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

301
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:16,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I was one activity or one car theft away from completing all of the activities and all the Saints book stuff.

302
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:18,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, you know, lost my safe.

303
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:19,368
[SPEAKER_05]: That was always fun.

304
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:25,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I also had Bioshock Infinite to play.

305
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't gotten the chance to do that because I was cooking this morning and also the Defiance beta on 360.

306
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:35,714
[SPEAKER_05]: But by the time I get to play it, the beta is going to be over and Defiance will be out next week or the week after next.

307
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:39,398
[SPEAKER_08]: All those Bioshock Infinite reviews ought to start hitting tomorrow, right?

308
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the game's out Tuesday?

309
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

310
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:41,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I right?

311
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

312
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, there was the one from IGN because, you know.

313
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:45,143
[SPEAKER_08]: They bought it.

314
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:46,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they bought it.

315
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:49,668
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm sure the game's great.

316
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,509
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be fantastic.

317
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure the game's great.

318
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlike the Walking Dead game.

319
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.

320
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,376
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been a source of comedy this week, hasn't it?

321
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:57,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like.

322
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:02,956
[SPEAKER_05]: EA's, I bet they're glad that, you know, The Walking Dead came.

323
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:05,377
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like seriously one company after the next.

324
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:08,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder who's going to have this shitty game next.

325
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Injustice going to be any good?

326
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:10,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

327
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:14,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like, you know, maybe Defiance because it is based off a sci-fi series.

328
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's not absolutely positive.

329
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:20,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my money's on Injustice actually.

330
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:21,603
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll see.

331
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:21,963
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

332
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:23,604
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't shade a game.

333
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:24,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Island Riptide maybe.

334
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't shade a game I haven't played Saints Row 4.

335
00:19:28,246 --> 00:19:29,087
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a ways away.

336
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:31,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the feedback coming out of backseas is pretty good.

337
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:32,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I can't shade a game I haven't played.

338
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,111
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.

339
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,793
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's confusing me.

340
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:40,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to buy Saints Row 4 just because... You're a whore for Saints Row.

341
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:48,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Saints Row, but at the same time, what they've shown me isn't necessarily giving me the most confidence that this game is going to be good.

342
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:49,648
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, I...

343
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:54,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Saints Row the Third, I really wish it was more toned back towards two.

344
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Two was the best.

345
00:19:55,354 --> 00:20:02,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like the best balance between a gritty game and ridiculous.

346
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,623
[SPEAKER_05]: But then three is just like, we're just going to go crazy.

347
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And four is like, we're going even crazier.

348
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:10,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and we're going to have a dubstep gun.

349
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:11,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, that's hilarious.

350
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,591
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.

351
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:19,577
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a lot of DLC, basically.

352
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:23,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, I remember the DLC from Saints Row the Third, your 20-minute mission.

353
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,765
[SPEAKER_08]: I need someone who was at PAX East and played the game to call in and tell Loki.

354
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:28,525
[SPEAKER_05]: No one played the game.

355
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:31,068
[SPEAKER_05]: They watched a video, a short video.

356
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:31,728
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't playable?

357
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, 10-minute video they watched.

358
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:36,193
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have been playable, but anyway.

359
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,154
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it's not coming to the Wii.

360
00:20:38,174 --> 00:20:39,455
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not because they fucking hate the Wii.

361
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:42,577
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because they have the engine done already and they're not going to port it.

362
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:43,838
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

363
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:45,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else for your gaming week?

364
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:46,059
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

365
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:47,440
[SPEAKER_08]: My gaming week.

366
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a very Blizzard-tastic week because obviously I played a lot of WoW.

367
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:55,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been working on a Hunter who's like my PvP character and been having fun with her.

368
00:20:56,565 --> 00:20:57,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Played some more Diablo 3.

369
00:20:57,586 --> 00:21:03,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I mention last week on the show, I can't remember when this happened, but I sold an item on the Real Money Auction House.

370
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,450
[SPEAKER_08]: on Diablo 3.

371
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,250
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you didn't mention that.

372
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I sold, guess how much I made?

373
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:08,411
[SPEAKER_08]: A dollar.

374
00:21:08,731 --> 00:21:09,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I made 25 cents.

375
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:10,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

376
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:11,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo-hoo.

377
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:17,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the minimum you can list an item for is a buck 25, so that's what I put the item up for.

378
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the transaction fee is always one dollar, no matter what it sells for.

379
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:24,936
[SPEAKER_08]: So a dollar 25 minus a dollar, 25 cents, baby.

380
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:29,190
[SPEAKER_08]: It worked for you.

381
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I can put that towards a card pack and Hearthstone, but we'll get to that later.

382
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:36,236
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I've been having fun with Diablo 3, believe it or not.

383
00:21:36,436 --> 00:21:37,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of into it right now.

384
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:38,598
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good.

385
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:41,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I played StarCraft.

386
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:48,626
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I did not play that new expansion, but all my friends kind of going back to StarCraft because of that expansion made me want to load up the game.

387
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, whoa, the launcher totally changed for this.

388
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:53,611
[SPEAKER_08]: But I loaded up Star Jeweled.

389
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:57,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Jeweled is the reason for me to play StarCraft.

390
00:21:57,135 --> 00:21:58,376
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't have the new expansion.

391
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:06,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Until I sell about 100 more items on that real money auction house, if I can raise $40 on Diablo 3, I'll buy it.

392
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:12,211
[SPEAKER_08]: If I make a quarter every two weeks, I don't think that's going to happen pretty soon.

393
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:14,422
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there was that.

394
00:22:16,123 --> 00:22:18,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Been playing some console stuff too.

395
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:26,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to admit, I played the Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate demo on Wii U. The demo's awful, you guys.

396
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:27,947
[SPEAKER_08]: It is awful.

397
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:35,250
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's the thing, like, I have friends that are really into that game right now that are, like, having a lot of fun with it.

398
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And one way it was kind of described to me is that it's like Phantasy Star Online, kind of, but a lot more grindy because it's a JRPG.

399
00:22:42,532 --> 00:22:52,737
[SPEAKER_08]: but I played this demo on Wii U and I just like the reason why I want to bring it up not that I like to review games based on the demo but here's the reality

400
00:22:54,554 --> 00:22:55,375
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

401
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,252
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

402
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:39,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

403
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:02,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, way to sell your game.

404
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:06,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now I'm like, okay, but my friends like really- Was Laundry more fun?

405
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:07,623
[SPEAKER_08]: It was.

406
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:12,148
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, I know there are Monster Hunter fans that listen to this show that are like, Rob, you're so ignorant.

407
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:13,570
[SPEAKER_08]: The demo doesn't show this.

408
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

409
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:15,812
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't work for me.

410
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:20,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if the company is going to sell me on the game, sell me on the game.

411
00:24:20,797 --> 00:24:38,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So now, if I'm to be sold on this game, either I'm going to have to go play it at a friend's house who's going to have to explain to me what's going on, maybe I'll put it in my Gamefly queue, but it's not like something I'm like... The urgency of doing so just dropped a whole lot.

412
00:24:38,337 --> 00:24:39,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just put it that way.

413
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:40,219
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

414
00:24:41,840 --> 00:25:07,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, go into comments from the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Actdeft says, Rob, you need to play Team Fortress 2 more You can sell stuff for over 100 US dollars You know, I actually, like, I was seriously going to boot up Team Fortress 2 the other night And then I got distracted and did something else And it was because of, like, last week's show Orange Right in our chatroom agrees with me about Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate That demo did not sell me on the game at all And it's a pity And you know what?

415
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:28,984
[SPEAKER_08]: and I kind of have to remind myself Nino Cooney had a pretty bad demo too but the full game's great and like I don't know what convinced me to take the leap of faith there or I would like I refuse to do it in Monster Hunter but maybe because the Nino Cooney demo I kind of figured it out and it was fun in the long run once I finally figured it out I don't know

416
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:32,425
[SPEAKER_08]: One other game I played this week.

417
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:38,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I just bought it today, so I haven't had a lot of time to play it, but I did buy Luigi's Mansion on 3DS.

418
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:43,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I've only got to do some of the early levels, like where you go into that first little mansion.

419
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:49,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not play the GameCube version, which I know a lot of people might be like, what?

420
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:52,055
[SPEAKER_08]: But I didn't get my GameCube until well after the launch stuff.

421
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:56,837
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I remember Loki bought me the GameCube as a really awesome present when Animal Crossing came out.

422
00:25:57,017 --> 00:25:57,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.

423
00:25:57,457 --> 00:26:01,340
[SPEAKER_08]: So by that point, you know, Animal Crossing was all the rage at that point.

424
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:04,303
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have time for Luigi's Mansion or any of the launch titles.

425
00:26:04,323 --> 00:26:05,403
[SPEAKER_08]: So I never played the original one.

426
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:08,326
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've played the new one, but only a little bit.

427
00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:11,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't really give it a full review, but I will say some pretty good 3D effects.

428
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:18,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And it really reminds me, and this is a compliment, it really reminds me of an old school PC game.

429
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:24,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Like just in the way you're kind of walking around the mansion on the top screen and it's like you're finding items.

430
00:26:24,478 --> 00:26:24,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's...

431
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:34,843
[SPEAKER_08]: for some reason kind of reminds me of an old school puzzler like an old LucasArts game almost with a little more action though obviously because you know you're sucking in the ghosts and all that.

432
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:37,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can find him hanged.

433
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:48,370
[SPEAKER_08]: No multiplayer or anything like that yet because I've literally only played the game like 30 minutes so I can't tell you any more about it at this time but it was fun and the 3D effects were fun.

434
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the whole little pixelator thing.

435
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:51,711
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like something out of Tron.

436
00:26:52,031 --> 00:26:52,652
[SPEAKER_08]: That cracked me up.

437
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:53,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

438
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:57,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so Luigi's Mansion 3DS and that was my gaming week.

439
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:01,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

440
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:07,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I think I mentioned this before, but just want to make sure you all know there is no Orange Lounge Radio next week.

441
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:09,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great Easter or Sunday off.

442
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:10,539
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be drunk on mimosas.

443
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:11,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you?

444
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:12,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, from brunch?

445
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,821
[SPEAKER_02]: No, where we're going for brunch, Marie Callender's, they give you like never-ending mimosas.

446
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:18,242
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of places do that for brunch.

447
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:19,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so happy.

448
00:27:20,143 --> 00:27:24,586
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like the friends that I have downtown that we like to go to brunch with all the time.

449
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:32,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we can't go to a place unless they have endless mimosas because our one friend is like, no, I'm not going if I can't get have mimosas.

450
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:33,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

451
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:34,494
[SPEAKER_08]: So good times.

452
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:38,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, so no show next week, but we will be back on April 7th.

453
00:27:38,755 --> 00:27:45,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Bobby's here next week, so those of you guys that turn out here pretty loyally on Sunday night, you'll have something to look forward to next week.

454
00:27:45,937 --> 00:27:58,321
[SPEAKER_08]: There may be a best of or something, but there won't be a pre-recorded show because we're intentionally setting it up so that we know episode 500 is on this day, so that way we can kind of plan a little bit.

455
00:27:59,501 --> 00:27:59,781
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

456
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:01,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's it.

457
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:04,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook, Orange Launch Radio, yada yada.

458
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:05,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into gaming news.

459
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:05,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

460
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:13,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this was completely unexpected, but Capcom announced, I guess, a little bit ahead of their World of Capcom panel.

461
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:27,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think it was teased before that, but announced at their World of Capcom panel that they're going to be remastering DuckTales, like the old NES DuckTales game, which is pretty fantastic.

462
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:27,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

463
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,472
[SPEAKER_08]: You should have seen the flappy hands I made when I heard that news.

464
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:33,412
[SPEAKER_08]: That was really unexpected.

465
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:35,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, very unexpected.

466
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:38,153
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically it's going to have hand-drawn sprites.

467
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:40,814
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have all the original voices.

468
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:46,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's coming to Wii U, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade.

469
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:46,755
$15.

470
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:50,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably, I want to say it was, I think it was this summer maybe?

471
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they had a date yet on that.

472
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:54,277
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, all the...

473
00:28:56,226 --> 00:28:56,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Granny Gummy

474
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:22,795
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy who does Uncle Scrooge was also Mr. Ed way back in the day.

475
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:40,845
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

476
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:08,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

477
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:08,816
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I didn't.

478
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then, now I have an excuse to play it.

479
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop asking me for quotes, Tim Schafer.

480
00:30:15,018 --> 00:30:17,579
[SPEAKER_17]: You had an excuse already, Rob.

481
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give you the Cliff Notes version, though, here, okay?

482
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:31,624
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, here's, you know, Capcom and, like, the inspirational music and the few games are so rich with such a wealth, right?

483
00:30:31,644 --> 00:30:33,084
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like setting up for it.

484
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:34,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, okay, so after all that...

485
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:39,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready?

486
00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:41,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Sing along!

487
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that it has the bopping head.

488
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:46,584
[SPEAKER_08]: But look how it looks.

489
00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:47,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it looks awesome.

490
00:30:47,384 --> 00:30:49,326
[SPEAKER_11]: How can I cut this off early?

491
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:52,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I have to let it play.

492
00:30:59,844 --> 00:31:03,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what, I'm very, the only thing I'm disappointed in is that they didn't show the moon.

493
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:06,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they gotta keep something a secret.

494
00:31:06,228 --> 00:31:06,969
[SPEAKER_08]: They gotta save something.

495
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:10,571
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like there was only Transylvania in there and one other stage.

496
00:31:10,591 --> 00:31:11,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it also can't be complete.

497
00:31:12,192 --> 00:31:13,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's probably not done yet.

498
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:14,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't watch gameplay.

499
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:16,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they retweaked all the bosses so they're harder now.

500
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:17,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

501
00:31:17,115 --> 00:31:19,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they have more sequences to them.

502
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:25,241
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to remember, as awesome as the game as DuckTales was, it really was only, like, six stages.

503
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,522
[SPEAKER_08]: It was about as long as the first Mega Man game, right?

504
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:28,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

505
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:30,985
[SPEAKER_08]: There wasn't a whole lot to it, so I don't know if they're, like, adding or whatever.

506
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:34,407
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, seriously, when I just heard it, I was like, oh, way forward?

507
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:35,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And Capcom, like...

508
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Who brokered that deal?

509
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that is like inspired genius for real.

510
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:46,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Because WayForward did a great job with the Double Dragon Neon, and they did some of these other remakes too.

511
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:48,238
[SPEAKER_08]: They did the Contra game on DS.

512
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:52,742
[SPEAKER_08]: They've done a lot of good stuff, and to trust them with DuckTales was...

513
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:55,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Genius.

514
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:58,966
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I saw the trailer, I was just like, yes.

515
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:07,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we all kind of go like, Capcom has made a lot of bad decisions in the past year, and this is the first time where you're like, oh my god, I can like them again.

516
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:08,208
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sorry.

517
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:09,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Please love us.

518
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:11,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool to like Capcom again.

519
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:11,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

520
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:12,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's something you want to see.

521
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Have WayForward redo Link to the Past.

522
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:20,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, let's just see if we can take that further.

523
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:22,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Have them redo Super Metroid.

524
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:31,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Go into some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Gamer Girl says, LOL, I'm still laughing because I had the lyrics wrong for so long.

525
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:35,562
[SPEAKER_08]: The trailer did kind of make a lot of you guys realize that, huh?

526
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:40,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Dan regularly breaks into that theme song at my house.

527
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:46,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have no excuse not to know that and the Darkwing Duck theme.

528
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:53,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Extover says, I admit that I didn't play much of the original NES game since we only rented it once, but I'm amused and excited by the remaster.

529
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:55,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't own it either, and I'm in the same boat.

530
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,675
[SPEAKER_08]: We rented it like three times.

531
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you used to rent it all the time.

532
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:01,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I did own the game.

533
00:33:01,497 --> 00:33:02,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say I did own that.

534
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:08,720
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's what makes me more, because now that I'm an adult and I can buy whatever the hell I want, I'm going to own this.

535
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,440
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be great.

536
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:10,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

537
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:13,563
[SPEAKER_17]: I should actually text Dan and see if he knows about it.

538
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:16,345
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya says, there's your list list.

539
00:33:16,545 --> 00:33:18,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Series way forward needs to update for 2013.

540
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:21,609
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great idea, DarkTetsuya.

541
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:22,249
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do that.

542
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not tonight, but soon.

543
00:33:25,032 --> 00:33:25,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

544
00:33:25,432 --> 00:33:30,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says, the moon is going to sound so fucking awesome.

545
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:32,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Technus says, $15, huh?

546
00:33:32,857 --> 00:33:36,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it took five seconds for it to make me want to buy it.

547
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:36,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Ditto.

548
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:38,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Ditto.

549
00:33:38,862 --> 00:33:38,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Ditto.

550
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:44,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the bottom line, as excited as we all are, please don't fuck this up.

551
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:47,287
[SPEAKER_08]: This is sacred territory, people.

552
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:49,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Please don't fuck this up.

553
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop raping our childhoods.

554
00:33:54,052 --> 00:33:55,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that it?

555
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:57,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we talk about the other series?

556
00:33:57,374 --> 00:34:00,776
[SPEAKER_08]: The possibility that they said they were going to do Rescue Rangers possibly and some of this other stuff?

557
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:02,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God, that'd be awesome.

558
00:34:02,116 --> 00:34:04,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, it's in one of the other, I think it's in the second link.

559
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:13,601
[SPEAKER_08]: They said that if this does well, that there is the potential that they'll do like Rescue Rangers and some of the other Capcom Disney stuff.

560
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:18,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sitting there going, Mickey Mousecapade, Mickey Mousecapade, which is kind of basic, but I loved it.

561
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:19,503
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

562
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:22,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally tripped over that cartridge the other day.

563
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:29,590
[SPEAKER_02]: because Midna has been trying to get up on the shelves to get the stuff and she knocked it down.

564
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,771
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the case and everything.

565
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:36,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, would this mean that maybe we'd start getting into some of the later games like Aladdin and Lion King?

566
00:34:36,317 --> 00:34:38,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was one of the other things they said.

567
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,423
[SPEAKER_05]: They said Chippendale Rescue Rangers, Darkwing Duck, and Aladdin.

568
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Darkwing Duck I would be happy about.

569
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:47,689
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says, from what I saw at the show, they didn't mess it up.

570
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:49,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank heavens.

571
00:34:49,618 --> 00:34:51,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looked good from what I saw.

572
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:56,303
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the boss fight against, who was it, Magica the Spell.

573
00:34:57,223 --> 00:34:57,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked pretty awesome.

574
00:34:58,524 --> 00:34:59,164
[SPEAKER_08]: So excited.

575
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:02,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.

576
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:04,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the other thing I wanted to say about this.

577
00:35:04,248 --> 00:35:05,749
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to make sweet, sweet Disney love.

578
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:09,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we've got a Mega Man thing coming up later on, but I have to bring this up.

579
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:10,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not just let WayForward do Mega Man?

580
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:15,758
[SPEAKER_02]: That made me spat so hard I dropped my mic.

581
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:17,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?

582
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not just let them do Mega Man?

583
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they'll probably do the game we all want, right?

584
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:30,225
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

585
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:32,006
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

586
00:35:32,206 --> 00:35:41,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, you know who should really be doing the next Mega Man, if they did one, would be letting the people who did the Street Fighter cross Mega Man.

587
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:45,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I know what you're talking about.

588
00:35:45,328 --> 00:35:48,510
[SPEAKER_08]: The anniversary, the freebie that was on the internet.

589
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:50,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, maybe.

591
00:35:51,772 --> 00:35:56,776
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the other big games that came out of PAX East was somewhat of a surprise announcement from Blizzard.

592
00:35:57,717 --> 00:36:01,580
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I had the other show, Horde House, where we talk a lot about World of Warcraft and things.

593
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,143
[SPEAKER_08]: And there were a lot of people thinking that it was going to be like a big thing.

594
00:36:06,203 --> 00:36:11,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was going to be another expansion or that it was Titan, even though Blizzard said time and time again it's not Titan.

595
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:11,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

596
00:36:11,747 --> 00:36:13,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it kind of did come out of left field.

597
00:36:13,489 --> 00:36:15,111
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not something people were predicting.

598
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:20,077
[SPEAKER_08]: The game that Blizzard announced at PAX East was called Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft.

599
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,460
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a card game, basically.

600
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,581
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a virtual card game.

601
00:36:23,842 --> 00:36:27,125
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be playable on PC, Mac, and iPad.

602
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:28,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of think...

603
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:31,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't they have a card game already?

604
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:31,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Blizzard?

605
00:36:55,202 --> 00:37:19,364
[SPEAKER_08]: they have a tangible WoW trading card game but this isn't that I think it's a simpler version of that and it's not meant to be a tangible game it is a little weird because both of those exist but I think there's room for both I mean if Magic the Gathering can be successful in both a tangible game and an online game I don't see why Blizzard can't have two properties out there

606
00:37:20,464 --> 00:37:21,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Now here's the thing.

607
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:24,287
[SPEAKER_08]: It is going to be a free game, but it's freemium.

608
00:37:24,407 --> 00:37:25,668
[SPEAKER_08]: You earn more cards.

609
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:29,511
[SPEAKER_08]: You can earn them through playing the game and you win medals when you do PvP against people.

610
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:35,255
[SPEAKER_08]: But you'll also be able to buy expansion packs, of course, with real money.

611
00:37:35,635 --> 00:37:36,576
[SPEAKER_08]: They're thinking about $1.

612
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:39,498
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they're thinking right now for the packs.

613
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:42,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Hearthstone will have 300 cards in the initial collection.

614
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,499
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's hero versus hero.

615
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:48,880
[SPEAKER_08]: You play as one of the nine Central Warcraft classes, each represented by a hero.

616
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,221
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, you can play, I believe Thrall is the shaman.

617
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:55,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Anduin is the priest.

618
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:57,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Malfurion, I think, is the druid.

619
00:37:57,682 --> 00:37:59,882
[SPEAKER_08]: You can play as one of the big characters.

620
00:38:00,242 --> 00:38:01,203
[SPEAKER_08]: And it looks really good.

621
00:38:01,343 --> 00:38:02,563
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, did you see this at all?

622
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:08,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is their trailer that talks about... Actually, let me see if I can find the match.

623
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:09,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jaina would be mage.

624
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,539
[SPEAKER_08]: If you buy me a little time here, I'll try to find the...

625
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:15,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm broke, so I can't buy you anything.

626
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:19,341
[SPEAKER_02]: But, well, I'm trying to think over who would be better.

627
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:19,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Here it is.

628
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:24,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the gameplay video where it's... I'm going to go kind of midway into this here.

629
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:26,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me make this a little bigger so you can actually see it here.

630
00:38:28,128 --> 00:38:28,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Your turn.

631
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:33,592
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll notice it's very cartoony and animated in the way it looks.

632
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:35,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you've got little panda houses.

633
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:45,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it definitely has some of the newer, even though we only see old Warcraft characters in this, it definitely has some of the newer inspired stuff.

634
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:46,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit playing Magic for a reason.

635
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you don't think you'd be into this?

636
00:38:49,755 --> 00:38:50,556
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a time sink.

637
00:38:51,678 --> 00:38:57,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Loki, I could see them wanting people like you who don't touch any Blizzard IPs as of right now.

638
00:38:58,162 --> 00:39:00,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone like you would be great to get into this game.

639
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:01,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Any interest in this for you?

640
00:39:01,384 --> 00:39:01,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

641
00:39:02,124 --> 00:39:02,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

642
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:04,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't care.

643
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:05,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't care.

644
00:39:06,026 --> 00:39:08,088
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're not a big card game person.

645
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:09,348
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not.

646
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:09,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes sense.

647
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:12,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'll give it a try.

648
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:35,344
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where my mind went, too, is I was like, oh, remember when Tetra Master was in Final Fantasy XI and you had to pay like a dollar a month to play it?

649
00:39:35,384 --> 00:39:36,745
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I never touched that.

650
00:39:37,845 --> 00:39:41,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I did my 30-day free trial of Tetra Master and I think I maybe paid for one more month.

651
00:39:41,486 --> 00:39:42,106
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fun.

652
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:43,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't bother.

653
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:45,567
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was like 10 years ago, you know?

654
00:39:45,907 --> 00:39:49,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And, I mean, you know, technology's come a long way.

655
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:50,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I hated it.

656
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,048
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll try this.

657
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:52,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll try this.

658
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:52,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

659
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:53,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I downloaded it.

660
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:55,130
[SPEAKER_08]: If it sucks, delete it.

661
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,890
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't be worse than Yaris.

662
00:39:59,091 --> 00:39:59,511
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

663
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:00,871
[SPEAKER_08]: It already looks better than Yaris.

664
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:01,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Ain't that the truth?

665
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:08,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if I keep selling stuff in Diablo, I can buy the expansion packs, although that's exactly what Blizzard wants.

666
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:13,115
[SPEAKER_08]: And I bet we're going to see more of this, especially when the Titan thing is revealed, the MMO.

667
00:40:13,515 --> 00:40:23,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet there's going to be a lot of mini... I bet there'll be real money woven into that somehow in its own little economy where Blizzard gets a little chunk of it every time.

668
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:23,939
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an...

669
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:29,735
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an extremely profitable avenue for them.

670
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:31,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with more news.

671
00:40:33,246 --> 00:40:37,607
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, we will have... Well, it's not a surprise to you anymore because I told you what it is.

672
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:43,209
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have something special for our fifth centiversary.

673
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's how it would be for hundreds.

674
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's glorious, beautiful news.

675
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:53,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, we need to have Ding Dong the Witch's Dad playing in the background.

676
00:40:54,392 --> 00:40:59,814
[SPEAKER_02]: But the CEO of EA, John Riccitello... Is that how you pronounce his name?

677
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:00,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

678
00:41:00,994 --> 00:41:03,215
[SPEAKER_02]: is stepping down on the 30th.

679
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:03,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

680
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:06,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he has butchered some of our favorite stuff.

681
00:41:07,537 --> 00:41:13,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the whole reason he's stepping down, too, is because of fiscal depreciation in the company.

682
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and like,

683
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,411
[SPEAKER_02]: He's basically saying that it has to do, and I'm going to read you the quote.

684
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:27,738
[SPEAKER_02]: My decision to leave EA is really all about my accountability for the shortcomings in our financial results this year.

685
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:36,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like we will likely come in at the low end or slightly below the financial guidance we issued to the street.

686
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, and you know what?

687
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:45,443
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have seen the wank on a Tumblr in the Mass Effect fan community.

688
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It was glorious and beautiful and there were lots of dancing gifs.

689
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, those clothes.

690
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:08,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it really going to change anything?

691
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:11,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the people next in line, let's see.

692
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:19,992
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, right now, the interim leader is going to be Larry Probst, who was the CEO from 1991 to 2007.

693
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:35,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And likely candidates to replace is Frank Gibbo, who is the president of EA Labels, or their COO, Peter Moore, who was once in charge of EA Sports and worked for Microsoft during the Xbox 360 launch.

694
00:42:35,396 --> 00:42:36,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see Peter Moore, yeah, yeah.

695
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, let's see.

696
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:40,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Extifer in chat says, at least he took responsibility.

697
00:42:40,778 --> 00:42:46,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah, I mean, at least he was, it wasn't as good as the Groupon guy's goodbye letter.

698
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:49,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you guys saw that a few weeks ago, but that was good.

699
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:51,305
[SPEAKER_08]: You know shit's bad if Valve says no.

700
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:52,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, let's see.

701
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:57,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Bonds006, I have to agree with this comment in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.

702
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, someone will take Jon's place and EA will be EA.

703
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:02,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think this is really going to change it.

704
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:06,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he's just the fall guy for all this bam, bam, bam.

705
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:10,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Wars Old Republic didn't do as well as it was supposed to.

706
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:15,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Mass Effect 3's ending, just as much as I hate the length behind that.

707
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:17,981
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the whole big rush on that, the pressure came from EA.

708
00:43:18,641 --> 00:43:18,941
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

709
00:43:19,261 --> 00:43:19,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, true.

710
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:20,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

711
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:23,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And now SimCity, you know, and all that.

712
00:43:23,123 --> 00:43:24,203
[SPEAKER_08]: They had to give free games away.

713
00:43:24,243 --> 00:43:26,464
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just the head of the Hydra.

714
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:35,228
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, though, this is coming out right before, well, right after they found out that they're going to be next, again, on the top ten list of worst companies to work for.

715
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:36,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

716
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:39,343
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

717
00:44:00,729 --> 00:44:13,035
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, I would like to be hopeful to see better things come out, to see a new direction, you know, to see them stop snatching up companies left and right and ruining their... Fix goddamn Origin.

718
00:44:13,435 --> 00:44:16,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I sat there for 30 minutes last night.

719
00:44:16,777 --> 00:44:20,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Myself, Alan, Shane, and Tim all wanted to play multiplayer, right?

720
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:24,201
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're trying to play multiplayer Mass Effect, but because Alan and I are in the same house...

721
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:25,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Fix Origin

722
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,097
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want us to take it seriously.

723
00:44:56,117 --> 00:44:57,139
[SPEAKER_02]: More like butt gin.

724
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:05,652
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm still gonna... I mean, honestly, I think that Origin in and of itself is a bad business decision to go through.

725
00:45:05,672 --> 00:45:09,838
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it's like I was saying before, you know shit's bad when Valve refuses your money.

726
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:10,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but...

727
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:36,802
[SPEAKER_08]: but here's the thing speaking of all that we have to remember Steam was pretty bad when it first launched everybody was pissed because it was bundled with Half-Life 2 and you had no choice there's a lot of that so like I want to be hopeful and say maybe there's a light at the end of the tunnel and maybe this will all turn out okay but I'm just I just don't have that same level of trust in EA right now they keep fucking it up end of story and I mean

728
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:47,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the entire Mass Effect series, even if there are... I like to joke around and call 3 a sparkly turd.

729
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's lots of stuff in 3 that I love.

730
00:45:51,287 --> 00:45:52,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the gameplay.

731
00:45:52,247 --> 00:45:53,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I love scenes.

732
00:45:53,588 --> 00:45:54,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I love parts of the story.

733
00:45:55,689 --> 00:46:01,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the whole lack of, what's the word I'm thinking of?

734
00:46:02,257 --> 00:46:02,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Continuity.

735
00:46:03,498 --> 00:46:07,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Really going from game to game.

736
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Changing writing staff.

737
00:46:10,106 --> 00:46:11,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that that pressure came from EA.

738
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:11,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

739
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:16,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Dungeon Buster in our chat room, kind of with another perspective.

740
00:46:16,327 --> 00:46:18,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what about the good things Riccatello did?

741
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:21,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Dungeon Buster says the board probably forced him out.

742
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:24,710
[SPEAKER_08]: EA stock has been on a brutal decline in the last few years.

743
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't disagree with that for sure.

744
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:34,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Dungeon Buster says Riccatello was also known for taking gambles backing Dante's Inferno, Mirror's Edge, etc.

745
00:46:34,652 --> 00:46:38,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for better or for worse, those were some original games.

746
00:46:38,774 --> 00:46:40,854
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I would say for better, Mirror's Edge.

747
00:46:40,914 --> 00:46:42,475
[SPEAKER_08]: For worse, Dante's Inferno.

748
00:46:43,656 --> 00:46:45,718
[SPEAKER_08]: But for better or worse, you know.

749
00:46:46,498 --> 00:46:51,143
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's like asking what did Bush do good for the country?

750
00:46:51,924 --> 00:46:53,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew you'd take it down a political route.

751
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:53,866
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

752
00:46:54,406 --> 00:47:01,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, I think I remembered reading on one other article that their stock increased after the announcement.

753
00:47:02,214 --> 00:47:02,714
Yeah.

754
00:47:04,608 --> 00:47:05,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

755
00:47:06,249 --> 00:47:06,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

756
00:47:06,629 --> 00:47:10,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragenator in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, which is worse to work for?

757
00:47:11,952 --> 00:47:14,933
[SPEAKER_08]: EA, GameStop, or Emperor Palpatine?

758
00:47:15,353 --> 00:47:16,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Which would be the worst to work for?

759
00:47:17,514 --> 00:47:21,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably say... That's really tough.

760
00:47:21,776 --> 00:47:22,697
[SPEAKER_08]: That is really tough.

761
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:27,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at least with Palpatine, you don't have to worry about being unemployed because you'd just be dead.

762
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and as long as you're on the Death Star that they don't blow up, you might have it pretty good.

763
00:47:35,317 --> 00:48:02,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I fucked up every Death Star I don't know, EA's gonna hire me a corporate or GameStop's gonna hire me a corporate office Now, if you're working a desk job on Coruscant, you're usually fine I'm just saying I'm not saying that, you know, they're that bad to work for To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase, draw Alright, let's move on with more news because Loki, I think you have something very related to this, right?

764
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:06,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know we're talking about, you know, Origin, but what could they possibly fix with Origin?

765
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:07,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Origin's perfect, right?

766
00:48:08,513 --> 00:48:10,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, oh, wait, wait, wait, what's this?

767
00:48:11,657 --> 00:48:14,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Origin has an exploit where you can use hyperlinks to run malicious code?

768
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:15,802
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not good.

769
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:19,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, apparently there is a way that, um... You mean run Origin?

770
00:48:19,947 --> 00:48:22,408
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not just running Origin, it's Origin Plus.

771
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:36,473
[SPEAKER_05]: They have this, and I don't even know why you would need this in the first place, why this is even part of a feature or something, but they have these URI hyperlinks that basically you click on a link on a webpage or something like that, it launches Origin and whatever game

772
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:39,536
[SPEAKER_05]: DLL at this IP address.

773
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:05,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not good.

774
00:49:07,158 --> 00:49:14,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Opening some sort of malicious file on a remotely controlled server because that's a thing that they have in there.

775
00:49:15,064 --> 00:49:17,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love their comment on it, though.

776
00:49:17,685 --> 00:49:23,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Our team is constantly investigating hypotheticals like this one as we continually update our security infrastructure.

777
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:30,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Constantly investigating, but I don't see a patch for this right now.

778
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they know about it.

779
00:49:34,336 --> 00:49:35,517
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being worked on.

780
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:36,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon, trademark.

781
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:52,767
[SPEAKER_05]: The best thing you can do is if you have a web browser or something like that, if you haven't yet clicked on one of these URI links or something like that, one, you get a prompt in Firefox or something like that that says, use this program to launch this type of file going forward.

782
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:55,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Just have it say, let me choose.

783
00:49:56,489 --> 00:49:59,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how often are you really going to be launching URI links through your web browser?

784
00:49:59,991 --> 00:50:00,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not very often.

785
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:07,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, you know, where they say they're constantly investigating stuff.

786
00:50:08,257 --> 00:50:09,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't wonder, though.

787
00:50:11,498 --> 00:50:16,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Something very similar now with the Battlefield Play for Free.

788
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:20,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Very similar with that is they have another thing.

789
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,020
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an exploit for older versions of Windows.

790
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:24,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything before Vista.

791
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:38,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Where someone can launch a mod file, I guess it's used to customize games and settings, and that mod file could queue also some malicious code somewhere else.

792
00:50:39,705 --> 00:50:45,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So very similar, but with a whole different game, not necessarily Origin, but that's not good.

793
00:50:47,868 --> 00:51:03,862
[SPEAKER_05]: and I guess they say that it's successful because I guess it overwrites a whitelist as opposed to restrict sites because of this mod file or like a batch file or something like that yeah they upload a malicious batch file they'll execute the next time the computer is restarted

794
00:51:06,796 --> 00:51:07,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun!

795
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:08,877
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of lame.

796
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:17,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll keep your Windows updated, I guess, but not everyone's going to be buying Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Vista.

797
00:51:18,122 --> 00:51:20,083
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are people out there with Windows XP still.

798
00:51:24,925 --> 00:51:25,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Who has it better?

799
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:27,647
[SPEAKER_08]: The people with Windows XP or the people with Windows 8?

800
00:51:29,928 --> 00:51:31,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trolling.

801
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Windows 8 apparently isn't that bad, really.

802
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:34,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I don't have it.

803
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:42,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to use it on my wife's sister's laptop to try to like... I don't like how everything's arranged in there.

804
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,546
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very odd.

805
00:51:44,086 --> 00:51:46,227
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, I'm sure it's a little bit of a learning curve.

806
00:51:46,267 --> 00:51:47,708
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the regular desktop's there.

807
00:51:47,728 --> 00:51:49,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just... It's odd.

808
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:50,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

809
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:51,510
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best way I could describe it.

810
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:59,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I know you play Origin every day, Loki, so you have a lot to be worried about with this.

811
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:15,046
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have not installed Origin at all, and I know I probably have somewhere like an EA account because I did for Burnout Paradise, I think is Paradise, but I have yet to... You know whose fault it is I have Origin on PC, right?

812
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:16,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Shane's.

813
00:52:17,048 --> 00:52:17,829
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

814
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:31,526
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

815
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:34,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably would have had to do it eventually because Alan's a big PC.

816
00:52:34,228 --> 00:52:35,709
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't really play stuff on consoles anymore.

817
00:52:35,749 --> 00:52:48,259
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, let's talk about better news and things that put a smile on your face as opposed to angry little slanted eyebrows and angry face.

818
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:49,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a sound for that face.

819
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, mmm face.

820
00:52:52,421 --> 00:52:54,742
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually really exciting news.

821
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:56,063
[SPEAKER_08]: I was very happy to hear this.

822
00:52:56,343 --> 00:53:04,427
[SPEAKER_08]: The Final Fantasy X HD remaster on PlayStation 3, it's going to include Final Fantasy X too, which I think is great.

823
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:07,489
[SPEAKER_08]: That is as reported in Jump Magazine.

824
00:53:07,929 --> 00:53:15,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Both games based on the International Edition, and yes, apparently both are getting that HD remaster treatment.

825
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:17,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're both the same engine.

826
00:53:17,254 --> 00:53:17,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

827
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:22,157
[SPEAKER_08]: The first trailer for Final Fantasy X just hit, I think, today.

828
00:53:22,497 --> 00:53:23,478
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can actually check that out.

829
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:24,659
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks nice.

830
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I will definitely be picking this up.

831
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that both these games are on one disc for PlayStation 3.

832
00:53:29,822 --> 00:53:35,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the Vita will be getting both these games, but they have to be purchased separately.

833
00:53:35,906 --> 00:53:39,088
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the games are supposed to come out this year, which is pretty exciting.

834
00:53:39,148 --> 00:53:39,709
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be fun.

835
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet another reason to not get a PlayStation 4.

836
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:45,112
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all this good stuff still coming out on PlayStation 3.

837
00:53:45,172 --> 00:53:46,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll actually beat one of them.

838
00:53:49,155 --> 00:53:49,995
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what my problem was?

839
00:53:50,015 --> 00:53:52,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I breezed all the way through both of them and still wasn't high enough level.

840
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:58,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really play... I mean, I watched you, I think, play some of 10-2 and I've certainly seen my fair share of YouTubes.

841
00:53:59,021 --> 00:54:00,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really play a lot of 10-2.

842
00:54:00,201 --> 00:54:04,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm kind of... I'd like to give it a fair shot and play again.

843
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, if you had let me know this, I would have just loaned you my copy.

844
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've also got 10 International.

845
00:54:12,815 --> 00:54:15,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft in chat says Final Fantasy X sucks though.

846
00:54:15,936 --> 00:54:16,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Wrong.

847
00:54:17,177 --> 00:54:17,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Incorrect.

848
00:54:18,117 --> 00:54:20,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I see where people take issue to it.

849
00:54:20,698 --> 00:54:21,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I do get the issues of it.

850
00:54:21,978 --> 00:54:22,719
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I do for you?

851
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:27,400
[SPEAKER_08]: But as the game itself, I really like it.

852
00:54:29,261 --> 00:54:32,902
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where every gamer has a voice and everybody gets their own opinion even when they're wrong.

853
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:34,082
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

854
00:54:34,402 --> 00:54:36,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when they're being a butt.

855
00:54:36,663 --> 00:54:37,964
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't mean that.

856
00:54:38,444 --> 00:54:39,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Only minorly.

857
00:54:39,978 --> 00:54:45,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, here's some good news, and I actually have to thank CatastrophicMagi for sharing some nice stuff with me.

858
00:54:46,823 --> 00:54:55,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, uh, European Wii U eShop lifted the age restriction that they were having, you know, where you could only buy the games after, like, what, 9 o'clock?

859
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:57,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was, uh, no, yeah, you could only buy them after 11.

860
00:54:57,911 --> 00:54:58,011
[SPEAKER_02]: After 11.

861
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:00,012
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Wii U eShop, all night.

862
00:55:00,273 --> 00:55:00,693
[SPEAKER_05]: All night.

863
00:55:03,885 --> 00:55:04,465
[SPEAKER_02]: What was her name?

864
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:05,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Ronda Shearer.

865
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:08,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I still remember that show.

866
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:09,009
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

867
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,210
[SPEAKER_02]: She was hilarious.

868
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:17,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched every single Toxic Avenger movie thanks to Ronda Shearer.

869
00:55:18,197 --> 00:55:20,819
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it had to do with German law.

870
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:21,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, hold on.

871
00:55:21,759 --> 00:55:22,580
[SPEAKER_08]: This is very important.

872
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:31,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, it's Ronda and we'll be watching Hats and Surf Nazis Must Die next on USA Up All Night.

873
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:38,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it wasn't because of the voice.

874
00:55:38,195 --> 00:55:38,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.

875
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:45,941
[SPEAKER_02]: The 80s hair and the... No, it wasn't the hair.

876
00:55:46,121 --> 00:55:46,942
[SPEAKER_08]: It was not the hair.

877
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:51,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Even I have to look at that and go, damn.

878
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,227
[SPEAKER_02]: What's she doing now?

879
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:53,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to have to Wikipedia.

880
00:55:53,748 --> 00:55:54,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great, Rob.

881
00:55:54,509 --> 00:55:54,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

882
00:55:55,309 --> 00:55:56,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Car shows, I'm sure.

883
00:55:57,251 --> 00:55:57,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Rhonda Shearer.

884
00:55:59,332 --> 00:56:04,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so yeah, I think it's really hilarious that we're talking about her and Germany.

885
00:56:05,017 --> 00:56:05,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, she died.

886
00:56:05,898 --> 00:56:06,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Did she?

887
00:56:06,478 --> 00:56:07,419
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just made that up.

888
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:09,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you!

889
00:56:11,963 --> 00:56:14,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and you said I couldn't troll people.

890
00:56:14,845 --> 00:56:16,206
[SPEAKER_02]: She's had some surgery too.

891
00:56:16,867 --> 00:56:18,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, her last film that she did in 2003, Prisoner Go-Go.

892
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:21,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun.

893
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:22,490
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's see.

894
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:26,292
[SPEAKER_08]: She's been doing Sheer Intimates LLC.

895
00:56:26,512 --> 00:56:28,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So she's doing panties, basically.

896
00:56:29,293 --> 00:56:31,553
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2010, Ronda designed the Ah!

897
00:56:31,613 --> 00:56:32,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Bra.

898
00:56:33,234 --> 00:56:34,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that a Pokemon?

899
00:56:34,034 --> 00:56:34,954
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes sense, yeah.

900
00:56:35,514 --> 00:56:36,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that a Pokemon?

901
00:56:36,135 --> 00:56:36,655
[SPEAKER_16]: What does the Ah!

902
00:56:36,675 --> 00:56:37,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Bra do?

903
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:39,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And the product was an overnight success.

904
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:39,696
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ah!

905
00:56:39,716 --> 00:56:41,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Bra is the number one selling bra worldwide.

906
00:56:42,617 --> 00:56:43,837
[SPEAKER_08]: That reads like a sales pitch.

907
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:50,059
[SPEAKER_08]: She plans to add cosmetic swimwear fragrance and Boomer Hottie into... I think that's... Somebody just edited that fucking article.

908
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to know what the odd bra is.

909
00:57:11,439 --> 00:57:12,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went to look it up.

910
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:16,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, this is things that they sell at the scene on TV store.

911
00:57:16,421 --> 00:57:18,483
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, Loki knows what an opera is.

912
00:57:18,963 --> 00:57:20,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I watch TV, okay?

913
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, infomercials.

914
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:25,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I also know what a slap chop is.

915
00:57:25,327 --> 00:57:26,247
[SPEAKER_08]: What is a slap chop?

916
00:57:26,287 --> 00:57:28,549
[SPEAKER_05]: A slap chop is a thing that you can chop garlic in.

917
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:30,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had the knockoff brand.

918
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:33,552
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucked because the garlic is stuck up in the goddamn thing.

919
00:57:33,652 --> 00:57:35,373
[SPEAKER_08]: USA chop all night.

920
00:57:36,854 --> 00:57:37,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

921
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:45,204
[SPEAKER_02]: So, can I go back to the story that I was trying so professionally to discuss?

922
00:57:45,324 --> 00:57:50,108
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because I'm reading a comment from Marissa in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Marissa, do you have an ah bra?

923
00:57:50,928 --> 00:57:54,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Marissa says, ah bra is a lazy, saggy bra for wusses.

924
00:57:57,073 --> 00:58:03,920
[SPEAKER_05]: According to their website, it says, say goodbye to pinching, binding, chafing, and discomfort.

925
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Prevents bra bulge and underarm cleavage.

926
00:58:07,765 --> 00:58:10,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Fits perfectly even if you gain or lose weight.

927
00:58:10,768 --> 00:58:11,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a chest girdle.

928
00:58:11,308 --> 00:58:12,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's machine washable.

929
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:15,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get an ah brief?

930
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:15,953
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

931
00:58:16,194 --> 00:58:18,796
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I have a comfortable bra.

932
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:22,391
[SPEAKER_05]: and I can wash it in the washing machine.

933
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:26,377
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a tank top made out of spandex or something like that.

934
00:58:26,597 --> 00:58:27,999
[SPEAKER_05]: It's seriously what it looks like.

935
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:29,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, back to the video games.

936
00:58:30,182 --> 00:58:30,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a boob girdle.

937
00:58:32,726 --> 00:58:34,288
[SPEAKER_08]: What gamers really want to know.

938
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:34,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Boobs.

939
00:58:36,132 --> 00:58:37,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, look at our demographic.

940
00:58:37,412 --> 00:58:50,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so yeah, basically they made some, I guess they had to have discussed something with the German government or found some loophole to get out of it, but now you can shop for games before 11.

941
00:58:51,837 --> 00:58:54,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I imagine she's talking about the Abra.

942
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:57,379
[SPEAKER_08]: They had to make a deal with the German government in order to be able to sell it.

943
00:58:57,399 --> 00:59:05,301
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, they had to strike a deal with David Hasselhoff because he secretly uses the Abra for his man boobs.

944
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:07,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

945
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:08,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

946
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm leaving the room done.

947
00:59:11,563 --> 00:59:12,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

948
00:59:13,604 --> 00:59:14,005
[SPEAKER_08]: God.

949
00:59:14,825 --> 00:59:15,166
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

950
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:18,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's travel around the world.

951
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:21,170
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need to get Marissa to call in and do Uta's brassieres now.

952
00:59:22,231 --> 00:59:24,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we also have the PAX East calls tonight.

953
00:59:25,634 --> 00:59:28,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to keep it on topic a little bit, but Marissa is more than welcome to come to episode 500.

954
00:59:29,797 --> 00:59:31,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, release dates.

955
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out in a lingerie store near you.

956
00:59:35,564 --> 00:59:35,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

957
00:59:36,245 --> 00:59:44,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Gates to Infinity and 3DS, and I believe today was also... Luigi's Mansion.

958
00:59:45,016 --> 00:59:45,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Luigi's Mansion.

959
00:59:46,337 --> 00:59:48,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember if that was earlier than today or today.

960
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:50,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so there's that.

961
00:59:50,178 --> 00:59:53,079
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, next week, also some big stuff.

962
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock Infinite on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

963
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:02,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

964
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:05,722
[SPEAKER_05]: WRC FIA World Rally Championship 2012 on PlayStation 3.

965
01:00:09,163 --> 01:00:34,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XI, the Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition on Xbox 360 on PC and 360 Final Fantasy XI, Seekers of Alduin Tiger Woods, PGA Tour 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 also the Master's Historic Edition if you really want to spend extra money for a few extra courses and I believe that's it

966
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:38,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to Japan and check out the release dates over there.

967
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:46,362
[SPEAKER_08]: On the PlayStation 3 on March 28th, Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel comes out on PlayStation 3, as well as Sengoku Basara Triple Pack.

968
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:56,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I am assuming that is all three games in the... It's Sengoku Basara 3, Utage, and HD Collection are all the games that are that.

969
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:57,765
[SPEAKER_08]: What series is this?

970
01:00:58,025 --> 01:01:01,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this... That would be Three Kingdoms, Sengoku...

971
01:01:03,342 --> 01:01:05,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Sengoku Basara is Devil Kings over here.

972
01:01:05,924 --> 01:01:06,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

973
01:01:06,585 --> 01:01:08,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I know it's over here.

974
01:01:08,086 --> 01:01:10,428
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Capcom Dynasty Warriors game.

975
01:01:10,508 --> 01:01:13,451
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little more cultish over here, I guess.

976
01:01:13,831 --> 01:01:15,272
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't release any over here, that's why.

977
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:25,041
[SPEAKER_05]: They had Devil Kings on PlayStation 2 and then they had Sengoku Basara on the Wii and PlayStation 3 a couple years ago.

978
01:01:26,802 --> 01:01:33,064
[SPEAKER_08]: The Final Fantasy XI expansion makes its way to Japan as well on the Xbox 360 for all you guys playing it on the 360 in Japan.

979
01:01:33,885 --> 01:01:40,408
[SPEAKER_08]: As well as Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel, Cave Shooting Collection, that ought to be pretty good, and Love Toray Chocolate.

980
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:46,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Cave Shooting Collection, by the way, since it is a cave title, I believe, those are region free.

981
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:46,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

982
01:01:48,472 --> 01:01:50,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something that might come to the store then?

983
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:53,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them hit the direct download.

984
01:01:53,955 --> 01:01:59,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Cave, the shooting collection, I mean all the Cave titles have been out on Xbox Live Arcade.

985
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:05,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say that it's probably, they probably will bring it over here.

986
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Axis Games might bring it over.

987
01:02:07,884 --> 01:02:11,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Axis or, yeah, it would be Axis Games I think they would be the ones bringing it over.

988
01:02:11,997 --> 01:02:17,590
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I looked up Basara means crazy or over the top, but also stylish.

989
01:02:19,522 --> 01:02:21,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Better than Basura in Spanish.

990
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:22,864
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?

991
01:02:22,904 --> 01:02:23,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Junk?

992
01:02:23,184 --> 01:02:23,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Trash?

993
01:02:23,524 --> 01:02:25,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Trash, yeah.

994
01:02:25,946 --> 01:02:29,828
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation Vita this week in Japan on the 28th.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1001
01:02:43,795 --> 01:02:46,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Who needs to remake the Guardian Legends somehow.

1002
01:02:47,277 --> 01:02:47,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1003
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:48,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And Guardian Legend.

1004
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:49,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1005
01:02:50,077 --> 01:02:57,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly but not leastly on the 3DS this week, Nano Assault gets a price reduction and Shoshinsha Kata...

1006
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,485

1007
01:03:02,906 --> 01:03:03,727
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a mouthful.

1008
01:03:03,787 --> 01:03:04,608
[SPEAKER_08]: What game is this?

1009
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:05,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff.

1010
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:13,579
[SPEAKER_08]: No pictures of it, but the related games are all like puppies and kitty cafe and things like that, so it's one of those games.

1011
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, how about the UK, DarkSakura?

1012
01:03:17,662 --> 01:03:18,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff.

1013
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:24,648
[SPEAKER_02]: In the UK, we have, starting with the 26th, we have Bioshock Infinite.

1014
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:29,431
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 27th, Lego City Undercover and Sly Cooper Thieves in Time.

1015
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:33,034
[SPEAKER_02]: The 28th, we have Luigi's Mansion 2 and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14.

1016
01:03:33,514 --> 01:03:34,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the 29th, we have Army 4.

1017
01:03:36,677 --> 01:03:37,057
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1018
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:38,218
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1019
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:41,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1020
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,161
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, Loki.

1021
01:03:42,939 --> 01:04:11,432
[SPEAKER_05]: WarZ may try to convince you that they were part of this program they actually don't have this program out yet or they just started it it's the early access program it allows you to play and purchase games that are still in development they have a few games starting off with Arma 3 and Starforge also a game I think should be at least a nominee for the best title of a game in 2013 Drunken Robot Pornography

1022
01:04:12,673 --> 01:04:13,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Sign me up!

1023
01:04:13,894 --> 01:04:15,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that sounds awesome.

1024
01:04:17,737 --> 01:04:20,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and then, let's see, was it Kenshi?

1025
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Kenshi, an open-ended squad-based strategy RPG.

1026
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:27,064
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too big of a subtitle.

1027
01:04:27,225 --> 01:04:27,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1028
01:04:27,745 --> 01:04:29,366
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to change that.

1029
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:38,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, basically, so yeah, so they're gonna add features and stuff that will be available over time, plus I guess you'll be able to maybe provide some feedback for the titles.

1030
01:04:39,734 --> 01:04:41,055
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's kinda cool that you can do that.

1031
01:04:41,636 --> 01:04:51,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Arma 3, I actually kinda wanna try that, but Arma's so simulation that I just would wanna mod the hell out of it, you know, get laser beams and stuff that are ridiculous.

1032
01:04:52,644 --> 01:04:52,784
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

1033
01:04:53,004 --> 01:05:02,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of like that whole idea about getting in early on the game's development and kind of getting to give that instant feedback and maybe your angry internet comments really can influence the game.

1034
01:05:02,588 --> 01:05:02,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1035
01:05:02,888 --> 01:05:03,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of neat.

1036
01:05:05,309 --> 01:05:07,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially in this Kickstarter world we live in now.

1037
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:13,252
[SPEAKER_08]: This seems like a great place to launch a project that started on Kickstarter where your investors, essentially, really can...

1038
01:05:13,712 --> 01:05:15,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Have their say on the game's development.

1039
01:05:15,052 --> 01:05:16,033
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one I saw.

1040
01:05:16,153 --> 01:05:17,273
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't Kickstarter.

1041
01:05:17,453 --> 01:05:20,654
[SPEAKER_05]: It was another... I don't know if they were doing it through their own website.

1042
01:05:21,114 --> 01:05:21,254
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1043
01:05:21,734 --> 01:05:25,695
[SPEAKER_05]: It was... Actually, it was a train simulation game.

1044
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:35,337
[SPEAKER_05]: But the difference was they were asking people to crowdfund it, but the people that crowdfunded it also get a portion of the profits that they receive from the game.

1045
01:05:35,757 --> 01:05:37,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're profit sharing, I guess.

1046
01:05:38,538 --> 01:05:39,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is kind of cool.

1047
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:41,959
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of neat to do with Kickstarter.

1048
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I might have missed it.

1049
01:05:46,561 --> 01:05:50,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any games you're looking forward to being a part of with this?

1050
01:05:51,385 --> 01:05:52,446
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not right now.

1051
01:05:52,966 --> 01:05:55,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Arma 3 looks kind of cool.

1052
01:05:55,188 --> 01:06:01,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I may have to check out the robot pornography game because that's an awesome title and I like giant robot games.

1053
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:03,615
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be interesting to check out.

1054
01:06:04,372 --> 01:06:14,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well one more story for you guys and I alluded to this earlier when we were talking about DuckTales but there was some talk about Mega Man at PAX East at the World of Capcom panel.

1055
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:23,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Brett Elston, the Capcom community manager said that Capcom is developing a new game in the Mega Man series but they're not ready to fully announce it just yet.

1056
01:06:23,607 --> 01:06:25,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is kind of a duh.

1057
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:29,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, despite the canceled projects, I mean, like, would you really just drop something like a Mega Man?

1058
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:34,416
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think you put it to bed for a few years and then it comes back better than ever, right?

1059
01:06:34,776 --> 01:06:36,618
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably what's happening here.

1060
01:06:36,738 --> 01:06:48,867
[SPEAKER_08]: However, since this story first broke on the internet, Capcom kind of came behind the community manager here and said, now, now, now, now, no Mega Man game has been confirmed.

1061
01:06:48,887 --> 01:06:49,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1062
01:06:49,628 --> 01:06:54,938
[SPEAKER_08]: The company is having ongoing discussions about Mega Man but it won't announce anything until something is ready.

1063
01:06:55,459 --> 01:06:58,104
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't hold your breath that that's necessarily this year.

1064
01:06:58,164 --> 01:06:59,447
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be a long time.

1065
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:07,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Shane was sending me some private messages when we were talking about the whole DuckTales and WayForward thing and saying, what else should WayForward do?

1066
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:12,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And Shane was reminding me, Rob, WayForward doesn't always strike gold.

1067
01:07:12,914 --> 01:07:17,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's pull up WayForward's resume and see some of the other games that they've done in the past.

1068
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Godzilla Domination on the Game Boy Advance.

1069
01:07:22,424 --> 01:07:36,705
[SPEAKER_08]: SpongeBob SquarePants, Lights, Camera, Pants The A Boy and His Blob on the Wii Although to be fair, I never really gave that a try I really wanted to play that too because I love the first one Let's see, the Silent Hill Book of Memories game on the Vita But see

1070
01:07:37,746 --> 01:07:38,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Shane didn't like that.

1071
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:40,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think it was terrible.

1072
01:07:40,288 --> 01:07:43,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't think it was great, but it's decent.

1073
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:45,431
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't very Silent Hill-y, was it?

1074
01:07:45,651 --> 01:07:50,174
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the biggest sin WayForward has ever committed.

1075
01:07:50,194 --> 01:07:50,835
[SPEAKER_08]: You ready for this?

1076
01:07:51,315 --> 01:07:54,697
[SPEAKER_08]: A Nintendo DS game called Ping Pals.

1077
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:55,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

1078
01:07:55,778 --> 01:07:56,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember this game?

1079
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,142
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't play it, but I remember.

1080
01:08:01,242 --> 01:08:03,823
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like somebody put out PictoChat as a game.

1081
01:08:03,843 --> 01:08:07,126
[SPEAKER_08]: But how long ago was that?

1082
01:08:07,146 --> 01:08:07,846
[SPEAKER_08]: 2004, glad you asked.

1083
01:08:08,246 --> 01:08:09,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, think about it.

1084
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:12,529
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done their time.

1085
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,250
[SPEAKER_05]: They did their time in jail.

1086
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:17,192
[SPEAKER_05]: They've learned their lesson.

1087
01:08:18,593 --> 01:08:22,856
[SPEAKER_05]: They made some bad mistakes as kids, and now they're adults.

1088
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:26,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I have Queen's We Are the Champions going through my head?

1089
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:27,820
[SPEAKER_08]: BloodRayne Betrayal

1090
01:08:45,976 --> 01:08:46,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Shantae Risky's Revenge

1091
01:09:05,443 --> 01:09:20,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want to mention, because I do happen to follow them on Facebook, the 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3, they did post a wonderful update regarding a fan-made game in the Mega Man series.

1092
01:09:20,472 --> 01:09:22,293
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called The Master System.

1093
01:09:22,793 --> 01:09:27,696
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an action brawler game based in the Mega Man Legends series.

1094
01:09:27,716 --> 01:09:31,098
[SPEAKER_05]: They have two unique characters, and you fight a bunch of the Reaverbots.

1095
01:09:31,778 --> 01:09:51,031
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can check it out for free right now it's arcade.legends-station.com slash question mark SP equals master system so check it out or follow the 100,000 strong for Bring Back Mega Legends 3 which they are now 101,000 strong just saying

1096
01:09:59,016 --> 01:10:02,058
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw in chat linking us to some Ping Pals gameplay.

1097
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:03,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Check that out.

1098
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:11,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you have an actual little keyboard you can type on or you can draw and you have coins to buy stuff for your avatar.

1099
01:10:12,464 --> 01:10:12,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1100
01:10:32,518 --> 01:10:38,466
[SPEAKER_08]: What if, when this game started development, they didn't know that Nintendo was going to put PictoChat into the system?

1101
01:10:38,806 --> 01:10:40,428
[SPEAKER_08]: What if there had been no PictoChat?

1102
01:10:40,709 --> 01:10:42,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Would we be giving Ping Pals such shit?

1103
01:10:43,675 --> 01:10:44,716
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1104
01:11:12,549 --> 01:11:15,152
[SPEAKER_08]: You kids and your frickin' HD reboots.

1105
01:11:15,812 --> 01:11:18,075
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case it's, hey, I can't believe I haven't done this one yet.

1106
01:11:18,295 --> 01:11:21,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Go play this pixelated classic and love it.

1107
01:11:21,959 --> 01:11:23,500
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1108
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Eternal Champions.

1109
01:11:25,442 --> 01:11:26,483
[SPEAKER_02]: How have I never done this?

1110
01:11:27,524 --> 01:11:28,405
[SPEAKER_08]: You say that every week.

1111
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:29,426
[SPEAKER_08]: How have I never done this?

1112
01:11:30,648 --> 01:11:33,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like sitting down trying to go through all of the, oh fuck.

1113
01:11:35,729 --> 01:11:36,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Do your, read your thing.

1114
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:39,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, Eternal Champions came out in 1993.

1115
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:47,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a 2D fighting game and they came out for the Mega Drive or Sega Genesis that same year.

1116
01:11:48,495 --> 01:11:58,780
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was sort of like a Mortal Kombat-y type of thing where there were overkills and special moves and things.

1117
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:08,009
[SPEAKER_02]: But, it did spawn one of the best sequels ever, which was Eternal Champion's Challenge from the Dark Side, which was basically the Sega CD version.

1118
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:16,559
[SPEAKER_02]: And two other spin-offs, there was a, it's just set in that universe, and it's also out on the Wii Virtual Console account, 2007.

1119
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:20,373
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, it's just this typical fighting game.

1120
01:12:20,413 --> 01:12:22,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it works a lot like Street Fighter II.

1121
01:12:23,836 --> 01:12:28,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It uses the six-button controller, though, so that you can have the different ones.

1122
01:12:28,618 --> 01:12:31,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And the version of this that I have, I got with Sega Activator.

1123
01:12:32,261 --> 01:12:33,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the Activator?

1124
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:34,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he had one of those Activators.

1125
01:12:34,902 --> 01:12:36,703
[SPEAKER_08]: He was trying to build a para-para machine out of it.

1126
01:12:37,584 --> 01:12:38,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think I threw it away.

1127
01:12:39,915 --> 01:12:41,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you how we got our activator.

1128
01:12:41,716 --> 01:12:45,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Right before Virgin went out of business, we bought it for $8.

1129
01:12:46,277 --> 01:12:48,418
[SPEAKER_02]: A Genesis activator.

1130
01:12:49,658 --> 01:12:52,459
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we have our copy.

1131
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,660
[SPEAKER_08]: It was that long ago when Virgin Megastore went out of business?

1132
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:59,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was very soon after I moved out here.

1133
01:12:59,401 --> 01:12:59,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, okay.

1134
01:13:01,382 --> 01:13:02,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Longer than 10 years ago.

1135
01:13:02,714 --> 01:13:03,775
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1136
01:13:20,071 --> 01:13:46,516
[SPEAKER_02]: you also had a special attack meter so that you could do different specials and then you had your overkills and that was stage specific I'm getting tongue tied today these are basically you have to defeat your opponent where they fall in a certain area of the ground if they land in the right spot the life bars disappear and something in the background kills them to death

1137
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:50,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for example... Wow, this person just got set on fire.

1138
01:13:50,518 --> 01:13:50,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1139
01:13:51,018 --> 01:13:51,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1140
01:13:51,838 --> 01:13:55,520
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're... You can get vaporized by neon sign in Shadows level.

1141
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:00,402
[SPEAKER_02]: A Tyrannosaurus can kill you in Slashes level.

1142
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:00,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Good lord!

1143
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:02,643
[SPEAKER_08]: That goes on forever.

1144
01:14:02,703 --> 01:14:08,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, not only did the guy get set on fire, but then you see a skeleton, and then the head falls off the skeleton.

1145
01:14:08,806 --> 01:14:09,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Like... Yeah.

1146
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:12,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

1147
01:14:12,088 --> 01:14:13,929
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a drive-by shooting in Larsen's level.

1148
01:14:14,289 --> 01:14:16,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And a napalm bomb in Midnight's level.

1149
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:24,594
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there were a bunch of characters, and I'm going to go through the character lists real quick, just because some of them had some fun names.

1150
01:14:25,554 --> 01:14:41,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were some of the, I thought some of the better characters were in the second one, but you had Shadow Miyamoto, Rax Coswell, Jonathan Blade, Jetta Max, Slash Trident, Xavier Pendragon, Mitchell Middleton Knight, who was Midnight, ha ha with a K, and

1151
01:14:42,302 --> 01:14:53,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Larson Tyler, The Eternal Champion, you had Qin Wo, Dawson McShane, who was kind of fun, Ramsey's the third, Raven Gendar, Senator, and Riptide de Medici.

1152
01:14:54,793 --> 01:14:58,236
[SPEAKER_02]: People love to hate on those de Medici's, I swear, but they were all busy killing each other and being Pope.

1153
01:14:58,796 --> 01:15:00,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you had Blast Chavez, and then some animals.

1154
01:15:01,604 --> 01:15:03,306
[SPEAKER_08]: This game looks kind of derpy, though.

1155
01:15:03,546 --> 01:15:05,328
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of derpy, but it was classic.

1156
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:05,869
[SPEAKER_02]: It's classic.

1157
01:15:06,289 --> 01:15:07,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough, fair enough.

1158
01:15:08,352 --> 01:15:09,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Classically derpy.

1159
01:15:10,194 --> 01:15:14,219
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the slurpy flavor that was Sega Eternal Champions Cherry.

1160
01:15:16,102 --> 01:15:17,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was at 7-Eleven, of course.

1161
01:15:17,844 --> 01:15:21,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there were game books that came out that were released by Puffin Books.

1162
01:15:23,709 --> 01:15:28,033
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a comic about this.

1163
01:15:28,093 --> 01:15:35,480
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Eternal Champions Special that was done by the UK Sega magazine, Sonic the Comic.

1164
01:15:38,022 --> 01:15:39,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony?

1165
01:15:41,345 --> 01:15:41,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.

1166
01:15:41,966 --> 01:15:42,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1167
01:15:43,035 --> 01:15:50,298
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically sampled Eternal Champions for their songs Eternal and Crossroad.

1168
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:52,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1169
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:54,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Crossroad samples Eternal Champions?

1170
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,680
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like their biggest hit.

1171
01:15:57,021 --> 01:16:00,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And Courage the Cowardly Dog also used some of the same audio loops.

1172
01:16:01,863 --> 01:16:08,665
[SPEAKER_02]: EGM actually sponsored Eternal Champions tournaments, which I remember a few people...

1173
01:16:11,797 --> 01:16:16,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I knew one person who actually was in one of those a while back, but don't quote me on that.

1174
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:20,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like I said, it came with the Activator.

1175
01:16:20,422 --> 01:16:24,865
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a Special Moves Edition that was a handheld Tiger game.

1176
01:16:25,465 --> 01:16:28,227
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically was just a really crappy version of Eternal Champions.

1177
01:16:30,661 --> 01:16:53,721
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically it was a pretty mediocre game I mean I thought that the Sega CD one was better and then they were going to do Eternal Champions the final chapter for the Saturn but they cancelled it so that they could push Virtua Fighter in the US I would like to know if there's a prototype of this sitting around because I would love to see it

1178
01:16:55,082 --> 01:17:05,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, as far as the spinoffs, there was one called Chicago Syndicate that came out on the Game Gear in 95 that was based on an alternate reality where Larson Tyler didn't die in 1920.

1179
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:09,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's Xperts, X-P-E-R-T-S.

1180
01:17:10,391 --> 01:17:15,594
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a side-scrolling beat-em-up that is based on one where Shadow Yamato didn't die.

1181
01:17:17,275 --> 01:17:18,176
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1182
01:17:18,196 --> 01:17:20,537
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all champions.

1183
01:17:22,145 --> 01:17:22,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Overkill.

1184
01:17:23,586 --> 01:17:25,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this one you get to be eaten by a shark.

1185
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:29,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm waiting to see if they get to the... They keep pausing it, so I'm assuming they're looking up the fatality or whatever.

1186
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:31,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Or whatever it's called in this game.

1187
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:31,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Overkill.

1188
01:17:33,871 --> 01:17:37,433
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the game that had the ones that were called CineKills?

1189
01:17:37,893 --> 01:17:38,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember that one?

1190
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,175
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a game that called it that, and I don't remember what it is.

1191
01:17:41,195 --> 01:17:41,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that TimeKillers?

1192
01:17:42,016 --> 01:17:42,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's TimeKiller.

1193
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:43,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I'll find out.

1194
01:17:43,756 --> 01:17:45,958
[SPEAKER_08]: TimeKiller was the one where you chopped off the body parts.

1195
01:17:45,998 --> 01:17:46,398
[SPEAKER_08]: It was funny.

1196
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:52,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Eternal Champions for the Mega Drive.

1197
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:57,778
[SPEAKER_02]: They were CineKills in Eternal Champions CD, is what they were.

1198
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:58,838
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it was.

1199
01:17:59,398 --> 01:18:00,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it was one of them.

1200
01:18:01,328 --> 01:18:05,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we are going to take a quick break and then we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio tonight.

1201
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:08,312
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a not-so-serious Google Question of the Week tonight that should be fun.

1202
01:18:08,452 --> 01:18:09,793
[SPEAKER_08]: A little more news out of PAX East.

1203
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully some calls, we're hoping.

1204
01:18:12,434 --> 01:18:15,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, Jamie's going to talk a little more about Mass Effect.

1205
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:16,817
[SPEAKER_08]: But don't worry guys, not too much.

1206
01:18:18,618 --> 01:18:22,220
[SPEAKER_08]: All that and more when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1207
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:35,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, March the 24th, 2013.

1208
01:18:35,971 --> 01:18:40,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Episode number 498 of our program in progress.

1209
01:18:41,212 --> 01:18:42,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello to those of you guys.

1210
01:18:42,373 --> 01:18:50,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently we've got a few folks, I've been messaging IRC and just got some text messages, that are listening to us in the car on the way back from PAX East.

1211
01:18:50,494 --> 01:18:52,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hello you lucky shits.

1212
01:18:53,015 --> 01:18:53,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive safely.

1213
01:18:53,935 --> 01:18:54,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1214
01:18:54,995 --> 01:18:56,236
[SPEAKER_08]: No, drive recklessly.

1215
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:57,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Faster, faster.

1216
01:18:57,076 --> 01:18:57,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

1217
01:18:57,536 --> 01:18:58,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Please drive safe.

1218
01:18:58,717 --> 01:18:59,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be driving drunk either.

1219
01:19:00,697 --> 01:19:02,078
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura will kick your ass.

1220
01:19:02,478 --> 01:19:02,758
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1221
01:19:04,579 --> 01:19:06,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into some rapid fire news.

1222
01:19:06,099 --> 01:19:09,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, there are things that are more painful to kick than the ass.

1223
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:13,722
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura will kick you in the taint or the ah bra.

1224
01:19:14,022 --> 01:19:15,043
[SPEAKER_08]: She will snap your ah bra.

1225
01:19:16,829 --> 01:19:17,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I will cut a bitch.

1226
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:19,850
[SPEAKER_05]: And she'll say, you mad brah?

1227
01:19:24,213 --> 01:19:25,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Rapid fire news time, Loki.

1228
01:19:27,494 --> 01:19:30,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's things locally I wish I could buy.

1229
01:19:31,896 --> 01:19:39,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Borderlands 2, they were teasing a while back at South by Southwest that there was going to be a brand new character class.

1230
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:42,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, PAX East, they finally revealed what that's going to be.

1231
01:19:42,801 --> 01:19:44,062
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Krieg

1232
01:19:44,622 --> 01:19:51,425
[SPEAKER_05]: The Psycho, or Kreek the, I guess, I don't know what you call it, the reformed Psycho.

1233
01:19:51,886 --> 01:19:53,927
[SPEAKER_05]: He's basically a Psycho from the game.

1234
01:19:54,987 --> 01:20:08,734
[SPEAKER_05]: His primary form of attack is melee, which sounds lame, actually, when you think about it, because this is a game about guns, and also because the character I've been actually playing as Zero has a melee attack, and I fucking hate using it.

1235
01:20:09,014 --> 01:20:09,394
[SPEAKER_05]: It's disgusting.

1236
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:12,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, there's going to be an Ultimate Vault Hunter upgrade pack on April 2nd.

1237
01:20:12,999 --> 01:20:14,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to raise the game's level cap from 50 to 61.

1238
01:20:29,545 --> 01:20:30,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Not 60, but 61.

1239
01:20:30,986 --> 01:20:30,506
61.

1240
01:20:32,707 --> 01:20:33,867
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so much bigger.

1241
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:40,111
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess the upgrade pack will be part of the season pass.

1242
01:20:40,651 --> 01:20:43,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's cool.

1243
01:20:43,733 --> 01:20:48,336
[SPEAKER_05]: The Psycho Pack will not be part of the season pass content.

1244
01:20:49,857 --> 01:21:00,923
[SPEAKER_05]: and also I guess the upgrade pack is going to have the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode which of course will raise level caps of all the enemies in the third playthrough.

1245
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:08,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode that's going to be if you don't have the season pass $5 for 400 Microsoft points.

1246
01:21:09,589 --> 01:21:14,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Also the Psycho pack is $9.99 or 800 Microsoft points.

1247
01:21:14,492 --> 01:21:16,413
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming in May at some point.

1248
01:21:18,115 --> 01:21:21,418
[SPEAKER_05]: and, uh, last piece of DLC, I guess, is coming out in June.

1249
01:21:21,698 --> 01:21:22,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's gonna be part of the campaign.

1250
01:21:25,901 --> 01:21:26,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, let's see here.

1251
01:21:27,603 --> 01:21:31,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm laughing because I just got a text from Bobby Blackwolf saying, I'm driving recklessly.

1252
01:21:33,628 --> 01:21:34,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Yell at Bobby DarkSakura.

1253
01:21:34,869 --> 01:21:35,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Yell at him.

1254
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:35,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh!

1255
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:37,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1256
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:37,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1257
01:21:38,031 --> 01:21:38,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Bobby.

1258
01:21:38,612 --> 01:21:38,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1259
01:21:39,552 --> 01:21:40,393
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my new word, by the way.

1260
01:21:40,413 --> 01:21:43,636
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we haven't done anything worthy of cancellation tonight.

1261
01:21:45,854 --> 01:21:46,615
[SPEAKER_08]: in this half of the show.

1262
01:21:47,956 --> 01:21:48,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Loki.

1263
01:21:49,178 --> 01:21:50,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Dust and Elysian Tales coming to Steam.

1264
01:21:52,462 --> 01:21:56,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And no word on when, but it is coming.

1265
01:21:56,387 --> 01:22:02,254
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be, I guess, not going to be doing a whole lot different than the other versions.

1266
01:22:03,135 --> 01:22:23,819
[SPEAKER_05]: but at least it'll look nice if I didn't see them and then the thing I want to know is anyone going to fucking buy this game because I kind of want to buy this game but I want people to play with and you know no one answered me on Twitter so fuck them I'm sure that they had you know more important things to do wait I think that was actually before PAX so fuck you guys for not responding back in the first place and I bet if you ask on Tumblr you'll just get a bunch of likes and no answers

1267
01:22:24,099 --> 01:22:31,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so, but yes, Duke Nukem 3D has come out on Steam as part of this Megaton edition.

1268
01:22:31,684 --> 01:22:42,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically Duke Nukem, kind of remastered, with all the, basically, you know, I knew that they had expansion packs, but I never knew anything was actually kind of official.

1269
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:45,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was just kind of this third, like a company making like a skin or something.

1270
01:22:45,892 --> 01:22:47,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I always thought it was a bunch of homegrown stuff.

1271
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:53,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, but I have the actual Duke Nukem 3D Mega Edition CD-ROM.

1272
01:22:53,377 --> 01:22:54,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't just use that.

1273
01:22:55,099 --> 01:22:57,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to get the Steam version so I can play through Steam, right?

1274
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so, yeah.

1275
01:22:58,842 --> 01:22:59,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitches.

1276
01:22:59,402 --> 01:22:59,902
[SPEAKER_08]: How much is it?

1277
01:23:00,703 --> 01:22:59,902
$10.

1278
01:23:00,743 --> 01:23:02,885
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I may have to do this.

1279
01:23:03,265 --> 01:23:03,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tempted.

1280
01:23:03,706 --> 01:23:16,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Duke Nukem 3D, the Atomic Edition, so you got your four campaigns right there, plus the three bundled expansions, Duke's Caribbean, Life is a Beach, Duke, Nuclear Winter, and Duke It Out in D.C.,

1281
01:23:17,116 --> 01:23:23,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess, you know, the PC and Mac and they're the OpenGL versions of the game.

1282
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:25,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Duke Nukem's in our chat right now.

1283
01:23:25,142 --> 01:23:26,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hail to the king, baby.

1284
01:23:26,743 --> 01:23:29,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Saying, I used to have the Kiloton collection.

1285
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:30,446
[SPEAKER_08]: That was official, I believe.

1286
01:23:30,486 --> 01:23:31,207
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one we have.

1287
01:23:31,947 --> 01:23:34,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Alan has it and I just stole it.

1288
01:23:34,429 --> 01:23:34,649
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1289
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:35,831
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have it right now?

1290
01:23:35,851 --> 01:23:35,891
[SPEAKER_05]: No...

1291
01:23:49,497 --> 01:23:50,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Instant gratification.

1292
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:50,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1293
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:55,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I want... Here's what I want as part of Steamworks.

1294
01:23:56,226 --> 01:24:01,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I want custom map supports because, man, I used to make Duke Nukem maps all day long, man.

1295
01:24:01,913 --> 01:24:03,515
[SPEAKER_05]: That was... I had one...

1296
01:24:05,216 --> 01:24:05,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this story.

1297
01:24:06,197 --> 01:24:09,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one where it was basically a water park or a water slide.

1298
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:13,121
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just the moving water and you would kind of go along with it and move really fast.

1299
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:14,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a drop.

1300
01:24:14,761 --> 01:24:16,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you take no fall damage, you fall in water.

1301
01:24:17,363 --> 01:24:20,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So the drop was done with holding Paige down.

1302
01:24:20,865 --> 01:24:21,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It would lower the floor.

1303
01:24:23,006 --> 01:24:25,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I put a paperweight on Paige down and went and had lunch.

1304
01:24:25,707 --> 01:24:26,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And I came back later on.

1305
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:29,009
[SPEAKER_05]: That drop was five minutes long.

1306
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:31,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

1307
01:24:35,348 --> 01:24:37,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Superfast Elevator Superfast Elevator

1308
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:06,042
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1309
01:25:31,378 --> 01:25:40,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't catch everything that's supposed to be in this game, but apparently one of the things they're adding are units from XCOM squads, which is a little silly, but okay, it can work.

1310
01:25:41,609 --> 01:25:49,797
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be paratroopers who drop in 40 units away as opposed to 9 units away, so alright, I can kind of see where they're doing that.

1311
01:25:50,037 --> 01:26:17,359
[SPEAKER_08]: but I kind of missed what else was supposed to be big about this expansion damn and there's not even the video of the XCOM units there anymore but alright if it's a Civ 5 expansion I'm gonna get it anyway I will buy that just as fast as Dark Tetsuya will be buying this next game it's La Mulana which has a launch date now for Steam it's April 15th just in time file your taxes and then play an even greater enemy in La Mulana or someone can get it for me for my birthday

1312
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:18,919
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

1313
01:26:45,929 --> 01:26:51,054
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the version that's based on the WiiWare game, which took forever to come out.

1314
01:26:51,154 --> 01:26:56,860
[SPEAKER_08]: But the Steam version will have the WiiWare DLC Hell Temple, because you know the game wasn't hard enough.

1315
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:02,205
[SPEAKER_08]: You can plug in a USB controller like your Xbox 360 controller and controller away.

1316
01:27:03,766 --> 01:27:08,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting comment this week from some of the folks behind Super Meat Boy.

1317
01:27:08,769 --> 01:27:19,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Tommy Refens talking about DRM in the wake of all the SimCity hubble-blue going on, saying that basically DRM is how developers shoot themselves in the foot.

1318
01:27:19,855 --> 01:27:20,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote,

1319
01:27:20,675 --> 01:27:21,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching.

1320
01:27:39,219 --> 01:27:47,766
[SPEAKER_08]: A company will spend massive amounts of money on DRM and the internet will break it in a matter of days in most cases When the DRM is broken, is it worth the money spent to implement it?

1321
01:27:47,926 --> 01:27:54,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Did the week of unbroken DRM for your game gain you any sales from potential pirates due to the inability to pirate at launch?

1322
01:27:54,991 --> 01:27:59,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, there's no way of telling and as such cannot be used as an accurate justification for spending money

1323
01:28:01,411 --> 01:28:11,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, hold on though, as much as you want to go, yeah, DRM sucks, and I do think overdoing DRM is pretty bad.

1324
01:28:11,058 --> 01:28:18,424
[SPEAKER_08]: The Steam DRM doesn't annoy me, but some of these DRMs that we've heard about in the past where you get knocked offline and so forth, that stuff annoys me.

1325
01:28:18,744 --> 01:28:22,987
[SPEAKER_08]: And the SimCity stuff, for me, that was really never an issue with the DRM.

1326
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:23,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really care.

1327
01:28:25,009 --> 01:28:28,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the fact that you had to play SimCity through Origin, I knew it was going to be bad.

1328
01:28:31,058 --> 01:28:33,099
[SPEAKER_08]: But some folks are playing it and enjoying it.

1329
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:33,839
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know what?

1330
01:28:33,859 --> 01:28:34,719
[SPEAKER_08]: More power to you.

1331
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having fun with my games.

1332
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:36,840
[SPEAKER_08]: You have fun with yours.

1333
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,041
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the thing about this whole comment.

1334
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:44,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Did the week of unbroken DRM for your game gain you any sales from potential pirates?

1335
01:28:44,403 --> 01:28:51,086
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I would argue maybe because the most critical time for new game sales is that first week.

1336
01:28:51,586 --> 01:28:58,749
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, if a copy protection or whatever scheme can hold things off for a week, then yeah, actually it might be worth it.

1337
01:28:59,269 --> 01:29:00,410
[SPEAKER_08]: But at what price?

1338
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:08,656
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the problem I have is that when that DRM starts to step on the toes of the legitimate player, that's when I have a problem with it.

1339
01:29:08,716 --> 01:29:17,402
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you have a game like SimCity where the DRM is really bad as far as like the launch week was all messed up, you may have people that are just like, you know what?

1340
01:29:18,282 --> 01:29:22,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not going to pirate that game because I don't want to play it.

1341
01:29:22,485 --> 01:29:23,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1342
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:25,920
[SPEAKER_05]: The Walking Dead Intro Video

1343
01:29:45,638 --> 01:29:48,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I kid you not, and you can even see this in the reviews.

1344
01:29:48,599 --> 01:29:49,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I saw the video.

1345
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:51,499
[SPEAKER_08]: That was bad.

1346
01:29:51,639 --> 01:29:54,020
[SPEAKER_08]: The mouse is still there, right?

1347
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:54,820
[SPEAKER_05]: The mouse pointer.

1348
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:55,420
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bad.

1349
01:29:56,521 --> 01:29:56,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1350
01:29:57,381 --> 01:29:57,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1351
01:29:59,661 --> 01:30:04,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, that just says... I'm bragging about how little effort I put into this game.

1352
01:30:05,183 --> 01:30:06,023
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what that says.

1353
01:30:06,812 --> 01:30:33,458
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's so sad that there's like there's bad Walking Dead and there's good Walking Dead like really good Walking Dead and the bad Walking Dead people bought a lot I'm sure a lot of people bought a lot of because or you know stores brought in copies of because the last one did really well and they're like not knowing that the two have nothing in common except that they're based loosely on the same thing even though the good ones from the comics and the bad ones from the TV show right that's unfortunate

1354
01:30:35,261 --> 01:30:41,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says everyone should play The Walking Dead, the Telltale game, of course.

1355
01:30:43,175 --> 01:31:10,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Dungeon Buster speaking about SimCity in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says it has other issues outside of the always online thing let's watch the broken traffic go in circles I find the whole limited space extremely limited space for the city kind of interesting now granted the old SimCity games had that too but the fact that people have broken it so that you can go outside those lines is really curious to me but again I'm

1356
01:31:11,573 --> 01:31:16,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no interest in SimCity before I really don't now let's move on

1357
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:20,215
[SPEAKER_17]: I like a nap in SimCity.

1358
01:31:20,755 --> 01:31:21,376
[SPEAKER_17]: That sounds better.

1359
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:22,116
[SPEAKER_08]: No nap.

1360
01:31:22,557 --> 01:31:23,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Stories.

1361
01:31:24,878 --> 01:31:28,121
[SPEAKER_08]: This is supposedly rapid fire news that's been going on for 20 minutes now.

1362
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:34,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of The Walking Dead, by the way, it's supposed to be coming out on Vita, the Telltale version that is, as in the good one.

1363
01:31:35,206 --> 01:31:36,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can play it on the Vita.

1364
01:31:36,948 --> 01:31:42,031
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know when, or if it's even going to be episodic or if it's going to be all at once, but it'll be there.

1365
01:31:42,972 --> 01:31:46,155
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1366
01:32:02,887 --> 01:32:05,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I also picked up DLC Quest.

1367
01:32:06,352 --> 01:32:07,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to mention.

1368
01:32:07,373 --> 01:32:08,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play it, but I picked it up.

1369
01:32:08,835 --> 01:32:09,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like three bucks.

1370
01:32:09,596 --> 01:32:10,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get that.

1371
01:32:10,177 --> 01:32:11,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredibly short.

1372
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:11,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1373
01:32:12,379 --> 01:32:13,781
[SPEAKER_05]: About an hour worth of your time.

1374
01:32:14,122 --> 01:32:15,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for three bucks.

1375
01:32:15,063 --> 01:32:16,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Three bucks, that's not a waste.

1376
01:32:16,505 --> 01:32:18,047
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot worse things I could spend.

1377
01:32:19,522 --> 01:32:20,183
[SPEAKER_08]: for an hour of my time.

1378
01:32:20,203 --> 01:32:31,033
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also Runner 2, Future Legend of the Rhythm Alien, Super Hexagon, Proteus, Retro City Rampage, and VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV

1379
01:32:44,506 --> 01:32:48,169
[SPEAKER_02]: but To The Moon though, I am in love with that game.

1380
01:32:48,269 --> 01:32:49,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing it very slowly on purpose.

1381
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:50,492
[SPEAKER_08]: To The Moon, Jamie!

1382
01:32:50,692 --> 01:32:51,312
[SPEAKER_08]: To The Moon!

1383
01:32:51,553 --> 01:32:57,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm basically playing a level a week so that I can sort of draw out the game because it's really, I really think it's adorable.

1384
01:32:58,019 --> 01:32:59,401
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned, Gary's mine for three bucks.

1385
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:10,877
[SPEAKER_02]: and Diablo 3 is supposed to be on consoles, but not necessarily exclusive to the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4.

1386
01:33:11,677 --> 01:33:16,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been confirmed for both, but they're not saying that that's the only place it's going to be.

1387
01:33:17,501 --> 01:33:18,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine if they brought it to the Vita?

1388
01:33:19,656 --> 01:33:20,376
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be pretty sweet.

1389
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:21,037
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be cool.

1390
01:33:21,217 --> 01:33:27,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Leaving the door open, though, for the Xbox 360 and the Wii U. I could see the Wii U. I want Unicorns and Ponies edition.

1391
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,301
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing but that map.

1392
01:33:29,361 --> 01:33:31,402
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to go to Whimsyville or whatever it's called.

1393
01:33:31,442 --> 01:33:33,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they need to have the Whimsyville edition.

1394
01:33:33,463 --> 01:33:34,923
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing but Whimsyville Quest.

1395
01:33:34,963 --> 01:33:36,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Whimsyville's kind of hard, actually.

1396
01:33:36,664 --> 01:33:37,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it Whimsy Shire?

1397
01:33:37,885 --> 01:33:40,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

1398
01:33:40,666 --> 01:33:45,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Ponies and Unicorns and Fairies and Rainbows and Barf.

1399
01:33:45,469 --> 01:33:47,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Specific, specific, specifics.

1400
01:33:49,028 --> 01:33:52,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Catastrophic Moggy in our chatroom wants to know, are you excited for the To the Moon sequel?

1401
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:53,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

1402
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:55,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Called To the Venus.

1403
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:56,331
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just made that up.

1404
01:33:56,471 --> 01:33:57,292
[SPEAKER_02]: To the butt.

1405
01:33:57,812 --> 01:34:01,133
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I will be excited when I finish To the Moon.

1406
01:34:02,514 --> 01:34:04,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that does it for Rapid Fire News tonight.

1407
01:34:04,495 --> 01:34:06,976
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's go to our Fugle Question of the Week.

1408
01:34:15,069 --> 01:34:17,370
[SPEAKER_08]: We ask a question on Facebook and a question on Google.

1409
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:18,711
[SPEAKER_08]: We collect your responses.

1410
01:34:19,091 --> 01:34:21,692
[SPEAKER_08]: You slam Facebook and Google together, you get Google.

1411
01:34:22,313 --> 01:34:25,234
[SPEAKER_08]: And this week, you guys, not a serious question.

1412
01:34:25,314 --> 01:34:27,155
[SPEAKER_08]: We decided to have a little fun with it this week.

1413
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:37,220
[SPEAKER_08]: In the spirit of PAX East and our upcoming 500th episode, a lot of you have joked in the past that you'd like to see a VOGCon or some type of IRL event.

1414
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:41,483
[SPEAKER_08]: What would a VOGCon or your dream convention consist of?

1415
01:34:41,543 --> 01:34:43,284
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're talking about people's dream conventions.

1416
01:34:44,005 --> 01:34:53,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamer Girl on Facebook starting us off saying, I think it would consist of DDR event in-house, whoever's it would be at, pizza, Mass Effect, and Pinkberry.

1417
01:34:53,892 --> 01:34:55,453
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just a Friday night at Jamie's.

1418
01:34:55,473 --> 01:34:56,493
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you talking about?

1419
01:34:57,214 --> 01:35:02,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that literally is a Friday night at my house because that's exactly what I was doing.

1420
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:05,160
[SPEAKER_08]: VOGCon has suddenly become slumber party at Jamie's.

1421
01:35:05,885 --> 01:35:06,646
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

1422
01:35:07,567 --> 01:35:12,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Haseo Tsuburagawa says, VOGCon should have Loki in the Tingle costume.

1423
01:35:12,253 --> 01:35:12,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

1424
01:35:13,054 --> 01:35:13,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Get over it.

1425
01:35:14,856 --> 01:35:15,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

1426
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:21,313
[SPEAKER_05]: If you really wanted it to happen, Eye of Judgment would have worked.

1427
01:35:21,433 --> 01:35:22,374
[SPEAKER_05]: It just didn't, okay?

1428
01:35:22,974 --> 01:35:23,314
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1429
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:26,436
[SPEAKER_02]: You should actually... I should have made that same... You just should wear your Sackboy outfit.

1430
01:35:26,696 --> 01:35:36,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have made that same bet with, you know, the freaking Wonderbook, because that thing flopped almost faster than... You should have made the same bet with the Wii U. Oh!

1431
01:35:36,482 --> 01:35:37,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on.

1432
01:35:37,623 --> 01:35:39,164
[SPEAKER_05]: That did still mill in copies, so... Oh, it did?

1433
01:35:39,184 --> 01:35:39,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, never mind.

1434
01:35:40,024 --> 01:35:41,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then, yes, you should have made the same bet with me.

1435
01:35:41,705 --> 01:35:42,585
[SPEAKER_05]: In January, no.

1436
01:35:42,905 --> 01:35:43,726
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1437
01:35:44,226 --> 01:35:50,108
[SPEAKER_08]: AZHP responds and says, as someone who goes to conventions, don't we all go to conventions at some point?

1438
01:35:50,128 --> 01:35:50,449
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1439
01:35:50,569 --> 01:36:03,074
[SPEAKER_08]: As someone who goes to conventions, I don't really care what actually happens at the event as long as there are cool people to hang out with, which basically means that a VOGCon would automatically be the second best convention ever behind Fanime.

1440
01:36:03,114 --> 01:36:03,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be honest, guys.

1441
01:36:04,735 --> 01:36:05,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

1442
01:36:06,775 --> 01:36:15,658
[SPEAKER_08]: James S replies and says, all I know is if Dan and DarkSakura are in the same building, they're not allowed to fight or bicker at one another at all.

1443
01:36:17,519 --> 01:36:18,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

1444
01:36:18,219 --> 01:36:18,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you guys.

1445
01:36:23,276 --> 01:36:45,986
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya said I think each show on the network should be represented with a different event like for us I'm assuming meaning OLR it would have to be either a classic game or a music game competition celebrating both our roots and video games roots in general I think we'd have to do the music game and let Bobby have the classic game I can't remember his tagline off the top of my head but he talks about gaming's history and all that

1446
01:36:48,327 --> 01:36:55,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Fabrice A replies and says, Dan should host a DDR tournament called Dan's Central.

1447
01:37:00,219 --> 01:37:01,821
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what Dan's reply to that would be?

1448
01:37:02,101 --> 01:37:03,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan's Central.

1449
01:37:03,983 --> 01:37:05,844
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd make his gorilla face and go, really?

1450
01:37:06,525 --> 01:37:08,968
[SPEAKER_08]: That got a like from Tiara, essentially.

1451
01:37:09,028 --> 01:37:10,969
[SPEAKER_08]: She replied and said seconded, essentially.

1452
01:37:11,693 --> 01:37:12,173
[SPEAKER_16]: She would.

1453
01:37:12,754 --> 01:37:13,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1454
01:37:13,694 --> 01:37:15,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Ossifer has an answer.

1455
01:37:16,256 --> 01:37:16,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh boy.

1456
01:37:17,257 --> 01:37:22,641
[SPEAKER_08]: A VOG con would consist of different gingerbread treats and fuzzy red teddy bears named Rob.

1457
01:37:24,582 --> 01:37:26,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Your sexy gingerbread legs.

1458
01:37:26,363 --> 01:37:31,947
[SPEAKER_08]: The rave would only play disco disco and main dinner entrees would always be garnished with oranges.

1459
01:37:32,488 --> 01:37:32,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Mmm.

1460
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,529
[SPEAKER_08]: VOG themed alcoholic drinks.

1461
01:37:34,929 --> 01:37:37,171
[SPEAKER_08]: A gingerbread legs martini sounds nice.

1462
01:37:37,571 --> 01:37:39,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Some cinnamon rum and butterscotch schnapps.

1463
01:37:40,546 --> 01:37:48,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Hanging with the people that I listen to so much and finally, in other words, putting faces to the people that I love listening to.

1464
01:37:59,267 --> 01:38:11,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and of course, DDR, Pinkberry, because I've never had it, Loki in a Tingle costume, and most of all, and I repeat this, everyone that makes VOG a network meshing together and having a great time, because in the end, that's what matters most.

1465
01:38:11,781 --> 01:38:15,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you follow that up with, oh, and Taco Cabana for Shane, which Shane liked.

1466
01:38:16,245 --> 01:38:18,106
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I like Codeman.

1467
01:38:18,206 --> 01:38:19,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Who doesn't like tacos?

1468
01:38:19,807 --> 01:38:21,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give a like for tacos as well.

1469
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:23,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Codeman.

1470
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:24,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Codeman's cool.

1471
01:38:24,450 --> 01:38:24,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's cool.

1472
01:38:25,311 --> 01:38:26,091
[SPEAKER_08]: We're supposed to play Mass Effect.

1473
01:38:26,111 --> 01:38:28,813
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been supposedly playing Mass Effect 3 online for like two weeks.

1474
01:38:28,913 --> 01:38:29,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1475
01:38:29,954 --> 01:38:33,035
[SPEAKER_02]: My next LOL effect picture is going to involve tacos.

1476
01:38:33,936 --> 01:38:34,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.

1477
01:38:35,537 --> 01:38:36,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything should involve tacos.

1478
01:38:37,858 --> 01:38:39,039
[SPEAKER_08]: In this case, it'll be indigestion.

1479
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:57,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Daniel N replies and says, if I can see the OLR cast and Bobby get back on a DDR pad, and Bobby is in caps, get back on a DDR pad on Heavy as they are now, and a tattoo artist on hand to do Mass Effect art, that would be a good VOGCon.

1480
01:38:58,386 --> 01:39:06,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe, and I'm sure I'll get a text message in a few minutes here if I'm incorrect, I don't believe Bobby was ever a DDR player.

1481
01:39:06,314 --> 01:39:08,296
[SPEAKER_08]: He was way more into Beatmania and all that.

1482
01:39:08,537 --> 01:39:09,478
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's actually funny?

1483
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:10,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

1484
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:15,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, since I've been getting on my big fitness kick, we're actually going to be hooking back up the DDR in my house.

1485
01:39:16,124 --> 01:39:17,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I would play DDR.

1486
01:39:17,246 --> 01:39:21,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I would bring back my alter ego, Dr. Dick, one last time at VOGCon.

1487
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:25,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked Mr. Spanky, but you wouldn't cosplay him.

1488
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:26,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when I did the DDR tour?

1489
01:39:27,015 --> 01:39:27,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still have the hat?

1490
01:39:28,015 --> 01:39:34,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm too fat to cosplay Mr. Spanky, and if you think these comments from Ossifer are creepy now... Mr. Spanky was bigger than you.

1491
01:39:35,982 --> 01:39:36,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

1492
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Mr. Spanky, and that was disgusting.

1493
01:39:38,464 --> 01:39:39,005
[SPEAKER_16]: That is true.

1494
01:39:39,145 --> 01:39:40,186
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, do you still have the hat?

1495
01:39:41,187 --> 01:39:41,987
[SPEAKER_02]: That orange fuzzy hat?

1496
01:39:42,007 --> 01:39:43,068
[SPEAKER_16]: I might, actually.

1497
01:39:43,128 --> 01:39:46,151
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I found when I was looking for my art supplies the other day?

1498
01:39:46,631 --> 01:39:47,232
[SPEAKER_02]: The orange bat.

1499
01:39:48,248 --> 01:39:48,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have that.

1500
01:39:49,268 --> 01:39:49,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I have that.

1501
01:40:12,233 --> 01:40:14,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody else suggesting the location.

1502
01:40:14,355 --> 01:40:20,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're in Sacramento, but there's lots of people on VOG, so we'd have to hold it in some type of central location.

1503
01:40:21,379 --> 01:40:24,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, going next to Actdeft.

1504
01:40:24,782 --> 01:40:38,791
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, a VOGCon would just simply consist of hanging with all my fellow VOG staffers in the VOG community, playing games, talking or discussing, maybe doing a special show for all the listeners, and doing what friends do, enjoying the moment with each other.

1505
01:40:40,272 --> 01:40:40,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Aww.

1506
01:40:42,715 --> 01:40:43,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, hairball.

1507
01:40:44,336 --> 01:40:47,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, Red Entertainment, Loki in a Tingle costume.

1508
01:40:48,477 --> 01:40:50,477
[SPEAKER_08]: That is like three people that said that.

1509
01:40:51,138 --> 01:40:52,178
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to happen.

1510
01:40:53,218 --> 01:40:57,199
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the closest thing, which was a... The Sackboy was pretty epic.

1511
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:01,121
[SPEAKER_05]: An artistic reenactment of what that would look like, and that was it.

1512
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:03,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, awesome.

1513
01:41:04,182 --> 01:41:10,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually read all the answers tonight, but join us on Facebook or Google Plus for future questions.

1514
01:41:10,644 --> 01:41:12,305
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do some more serious ones next time.

1515
01:41:12,325 --> 01:41:13,725
[SPEAKER_08]: But I thought that would be a fun question to ask.

1516
01:41:13,745 --> 01:41:14,686
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your dream convention?

1517
01:41:15,046 --> 01:41:15,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say this.

1518
01:41:15,846 --> 01:41:21,048
[SPEAKER_08]: VOG may not be having a convention this year, but we're going to be heavily represented at DragonCon this year.

1519
01:41:21,948 --> 01:41:28,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would say if you're in that southeast part of the country, or even if you're not, because I'm not, really try to plan on that.

1520
01:41:28,911 --> 01:41:29,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Because

1521
01:41:29,628 --> 01:41:31,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be there representing OLR.

1522
01:41:31,449 --> 01:41:33,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Travis will be there representing Under Sedation Live.

1523
01:41:34,191 --> 01:41:37,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure PodCulture usually goes.

1524
01:41:37,092 --> 01:41:39,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they're still figuring it out.

1525
01:41:39,213 --> 01:41:40,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Critical Myth, I'm positive, will be there.

1526
01:41:40,714 --> 01:41:41,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby will be there.

1527
01:41:41,514 --> 01:41:43,596
[SPEAKER_08]: British Invaders went last year, so they'll probably go this year.

1528
01:41:43,976 --> 01:41:48,138
[SPEAKER_08]: The only show that probably won't be there, I even think Rama is talking about going.

1529
01:41:48,178 --> 01:41:51,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I could be wrong, but he went to Atlanta for something else, so he can go to DragonCon.

1530
01:41:52,701 --> 01:41:58,724
[SPEAKER_08]: The only one that I would know would be Girls Gone Wow, and if we can make that happen, then lordy, we will...

1531
01:41:59,284 --> 01:42:01,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Fly one of their asses in from the UK if we could.

1532
01:42:02,286 --> 01:42:04,047
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that would be fun.

1533
01:42:04,067 --> 01:42:05,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't you want to party with Syl?

1534
01:42:06,488 --> 01:42:09,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love for people to send me a ticket so I can go to DragonCon.

1535
01:42:11,031 --> 01:42:11,972
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get on a bus.

1536
01:42:12,232 --> 01:42:13,613
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura across America.

1537
01:42:16,823 --> 01:42:17,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1538
01:42:18,786 --> 01:42:19,747
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1539
01:42:19,927 --> 01:42:21,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Fugle Question of the Week.

1540
01:42:21,068 --> 01:42:23,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into some more news about video games.

1541
01:42:23,351 --> 01:42:23,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1542
01:42:24,552 --> 01:42:24,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1543
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:27,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see.

1544
01:42:27,656 --> 01:42:28,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Double Fine.

1545
01:42:28,336 --> 01:42:33,002
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember they had that wonderful Kickstarter that kind of brought Kickstarter to the forefront?

1546
01:42:33,582 --> 01:42:35,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Double Fine Adventures now has a name.

1547
01:42:36,085 --> 01:42:41,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Broken Age is a point and click adventure game telling the stories of a young boy and girl leading parallel lives.

1548
01:42:52,973 --> 01:42:53,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh...

1549
01:43:13,778 --> 01:43:14,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Adventure ensues.

1550
01:43:14,879 --> 01:43:16,880
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the most important part, yes.

1551
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Hijinks occur.

1552
01:43:18,882 --> 01:43:24,045
[SPEAKER_05]: If you didn't back the Kickstarter, you can pre-order the game via the website.

1553
01:43:28,268 --> 01:43:28,749
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks neat.

1554
01:43:28,889 --> 01:43:29,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know.

1555
01:43:29,669 --> 01:43:32,171
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to see when the game comes out.

1556
01:43:34,451 --> 01:43:35,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, a lot of people already bought it.

1557
01:43:36,714 --> 01:43:36,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1558
01:43:37,074 --> 01:43:45,223
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be one of the first games to come out that just... Besides maybe, what, Diablo 3, where they just give a million of them away because people already bought them.

1559
01:43:45,644 --> 01:43:46,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1560
01:43:47,165 --> 01:43:47,466
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1561
01:43:48,167 --> 01:43:48,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow...

1562
01:43:49,608 --> 01:44:18,451
[SPEAKER_08]: some updates from Xbox games on demand some reasons why day and date launches don't always make it to games on demand you know there's a big push to try and get games delivered digitally at the exact same time they show up in stores because you know the convenience of downloading them and needing to have that game right now really goes a long way in selling them I know a lot of people bought Luigi's Mansion digitally because it came out right at midnight and a lot of people were like I can't even wait the six hours to get to the store or I guess it's more than six but you know what I mean

1563
01:44:19,331 --> 01:44:46,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, Eric Jaeger, the senior business manager of Xbox Games On Demand This is why titles don't launch day and date alongside retail releases Quote, we have a lot of strong partnerships with retailers We really need them to do a lot for us They're the ones out there selling the consoles, selling the peripherals And in this time, we're trying to figure out how to fit that into the whole digital landscape shift We're just taking a bit of measured pace with it So very interesting

1564
01:44:47,000 --> 01:45:11,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of kind of the converse of what you're seeing with Nintendo That they're actually purposefully giving a little breathing room to the retailers Which is ironic considering those rumors that gained yet again more steam this week We didn't put it on the show roll tonight because it's the same fucking rumor we've heard for a couple months But more stuff out there apparently indicating that Xbox, the new one, will always be online I don't think it's actually going to be online only

1565
01:45:13,328 --> 01:45:14,389
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1566
01:45:30,163 --> 01:45:43,792
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredibly risky to do that because if they're the only company doing that, remember, they have shareholders to answer to and they can't necessarily just go do this thing where, hey, we're going to go ahead and cut out all of the retail marketplace.

1567
01:45:45,553 --> 01:45:52,397
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to sell games digitally only or we're going to basically prevent you from selling your game used and that kind of thing.

1568
01:45:54,358 --> 01:45:55,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what they basically said.

1569
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:02,791
[SPEAKER_05]: This is coming from some screenshots of the software development kit on VGLeaks.com.

1570
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:08,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically they said... I'm trying to find this exact...

1571
01:46:09,638 --> 01:46:13,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Durango will implement different power states so it can be powered on.

1572
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,420
[SPEAKER_05]: It will draw minimal electricity, blah, blah, blah.

1573
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:16,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like the PlayStation 4.

1574
01:46:17,581 --> 01:46:21,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, with this always-on, always-connected design.

1575
01:46:21,443 --> 01:46:23,724
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, that's where everyone's like, oh, always-on, always-connected.

1576
01:46:23,984 --> 01:46:32,667
[SPEAKER_05]: They said the console will be ready instantly when users want to play and will maintain a network connection so that the console software and games are always current.

1577
01:46:33,147 --> 01:46:43,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that always on, always connected means that it's going to have a standby and it's going to download those updates for your games and system updates when it's in standby so you don't have to fucking wait for an update to happen.

1578
01:46:43,991 --> 01:46:45,351
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes more sense.

1579
01:46:45,511 --> 01:46:52,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, this was the same marketing spiel behind WeConnect24, even though obviously that didn't do the system updates and stuff.

1580
01:46:53,214 --> 01:46:56,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the way that reads is an awful lot like they pitched WeConnect24.

1581
01:46:56,074 --> 01:47:00,376
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, all these blogging sites and some of these guys that are trying to get these...

1582
01:47:00,956 --> 01:47:04,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Headlines, and trust me, I bought into it too until I finally read it.

1583
01:47:04,957 --> 01:47:05,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Always on, always connected.

1584
01:47:05,958 --> 01:47:07,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, there you go.

1585
01:47:07,618 --> 01:47:09,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to always be connected to the internet.

1586
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:19,121
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think if you want to use this feature where your console updates itself in standby so you don't have to wait for these updates and doesn't have to reset and stuff, that's what they mean by this.

1587
01:47:19,321 --> 01:47:24,243
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a feature so that, because no one fucking likes waiting for these updates to happen.

1588
01:47:24,263 --> 01:47:27,504
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trying to play a game and, oh, I got to wait five minutes for this shit to download.

1589
01:47:28,649 --> 01:47:29,370
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, in the meantime.

1590
01:47:52,799 --> 01:47:55,502
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1591
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:14,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1592
01:48:28,773 --> 01:48:44,429
[SPEAKER_02]: and that there's a statement going out that basically, and I really liked this statement here that's by the creative director for Remember Me, Jean-Maxime Morris, said, if you think that, there's no way this medium's going to mature.

1593
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:48,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really a lot of misogyny we need to...

1594
01:48:50,259 --> 01:48:53,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Those stats they put out for that Mass Effect 3 panel were pretty eye-opening, though.

1595
01:48:53,683 --> 01:48:54,063
[SPEAKER_08]: What was it?

1596
01:48:54,183 --> 01:48:58,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Only 18% of players beat it with Female Shepard.

1597
01:48:58,307 --> 01:49:01,270
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is, if you'll notice, the loudest part of the fandom.

1598
01:49:02,371 --> 01:49:03,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that 18%.

1599
01:49:03,572 --> 01:49:06,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I chalk that up to bros.

1600
01:49:07,757 --> 01:49:07,977
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.

1601
01:49:09,875 --> 01:49:13,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaden is a squad mate less than 2% of the time.

1602
01:49:14,561 --> 01:49:15,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't believe that.

1603
01:49:15,262 --> 01:49:16,303
[SPEAKER_17]: That's because he was a whiny bitch.

1604
01:49:17,404 --> 01:49:17,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Kidding.

1605
01:49:17,845 --> 01:49:20,027
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you, but you've been on 100% of these shows.

1606
01:49:20,568 --> 01:49:21,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1607
01:49:21,729 --> 01:49:22,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been on more like 95%.

1608
01:49:22,490 --> 01:49:22,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Still.

1609
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:42,110
[SPEAKER_02]: but the other thing too is that they almost didn't make Tali playable in Mass Effect 3 which would have been a shame basically enough people were passionate about it that they made her playable but I guess it might have to be why she wasn't even available until like halfway through the game but

1610
01:49:43,129 --> 01:49:46,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I've been running across people who say, oh, she's so irritating.

1611
01:49:46,231 --> 01:49:46,771
[SPEAKER_02]: She's so annoying.

1612
01:49:46,811 --> 01:49:48,512
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hell, she was great.

1613
01:49:49,672 --> 01:49:51,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though she's not like a very strong squad mate.

1614
01:49:52,594 --> 01:50:01,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember reading some story and I don't know if there's something you'd put on Tumblr or where, but that a lot of characters weren't playable in Mass Effect 2 because they didn't want you to get them killed before 3.

1615
01:50:02,219 --> 01:50:03,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, that was it, too.

1616
01:50:03,941 --> 01:50:09,849
[SPEAKER_02]: They were saying because they were part of, I guess, something that they had had in mind for three.

1617
01:50:10,409 --> 01:50:12,131
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why they didn't have them playable.

1618
01:50:12,192 --> 01:50:15,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, I think that everybody should have been playable for the last one.

1619
01:50:16,195 --> 01:50:18,316
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff that could have gone better about Mass Effect 3.

1620
01:50:18,736 --> 01:50:23,418
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Some of those PAX East panels weren't broadcast.

1621
01:50:23,438 --> 01:50:25,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they post them online like the Bioware one.

1622
01:50:26,019 --> 01:50:26,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.

1623
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:28,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to see that, actually.

1624
01:50:29,141 --> 01:50:29,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1625
01:50:30,582 --> 01:50:30,942
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1626
01:50:31,422 --> 01:50:33,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll get to the mailbag shortly.

1627
01:50:33,683 --> 01:50:35,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Or no, do we get any emails this week?

1628
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:40,353
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just the one that was just more for direction.

1629
01:50:40,413 --> 01:50:41,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we reading it or no?

1630
01:50:41,474 --> 01:50:41,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess not.

1631
01:50:42,615 --> 01:50:43,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I checked.

1632
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:44,558
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing else.

1633
01:50:45,118 --> 01:50:47,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, shame on all of you guys for not emailing us.

1634
01:50:47,241 --> 01:50:48,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, how dare you.

1635
01:50:48,582 --> 01:50:50,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1636
01:50:50,684 --> 01:50:51,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we still have some news stories.

1637
01:50:51,866 --> 01:50:53,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Cabstropic Moggy.

1638
01:50:53,167 --> 01:50:54,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Tally as well.

1639
01:50:55,449 --> 01:50:56,910
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we still have some news stories for you guys.

1640
01:50:57,650 --> 01:50:57,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1641
01:50:58,391 --> 01:50:59,251
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is kind of cool.

1642
01:50:59,271 --> 01:51:03,493
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a partnership that was announced by Sony and Unity.

1643
01:51:03,673 --> 01:51:12,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the Unity engine will now have ways to port games to the PlayStation platforms, including PlayStation 4, PS3.

1644
01:51:13,898 --> 01:51:42,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Vita, and Playstation Mobile and using these I guess it'll be easier to take advantage of different system stuff like the cameras and the touchpads and that kind of stuff, Playstation Network and they say also because of that it'll allow people to port titles easier to iOS and Android as well and I guess there's already some games that have used this including Might and Delight's Pid and Fun Bits Escape Plan

1645
01:51:44,577 --> 01:51:46,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I saw Funbit's escape plan.

1646
01:51:46,519 --> 01:51:47,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was the build of that game?

1647
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:48,520
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

1648
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:50,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that was the launch title.

1649
01:51:50,963 --> 01:51:51,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Pid and Funbit.

1650
01:51:52,384 --> 01:51:52,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Pid?

1651
01:51:54,225 --> 01:51:54,706
[SPEAKER_05]: What's Pid?

1652
01:51:56,465 --> 01:52:26,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what PID is but yeah, escape plan looked kind of cool so cool and I know a lot of people use Unity for all sorts of things so porting games will be easier and it sounds like they kind of are embracing indie development a little bit better I think they're finding out that hey, these indie titles that we're bringing over to the Vita and stuff seem to be doing well for us let's get them more involved with other consoles making it easier to get your game on there so I like that

1653
01:52:31,655 --> 01:52:34,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this something that will be for PlayStation 3 and 4?

1654
01:52:34,797 --> 01:52:37,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's all stuff.

1655
01:52:37,399 --> 01:52:39,601
[SPEAKER_05]: 3, 4, Vita, and mobile.

1656
01:52:39,661 --> 01:52:40,281
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

1657
01:52:40,501 --> 01:52:46,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, with a new console coming out this year, it seems like there's so much still on the PlayStation 3.

1658
01:52:47,367 --> 01:52:54,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's kind of hard to sell your next console when there's all this stuff coming to your current console.

1659
01:52:54,713 --> 01:52:55,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1660
01:52:56,181 --> 01:53:01,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you guys remember Street Fighter X Tekken, you know, and it was okay.

1661
01:53:01,989 --> 01:53:06,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it was as good as a lot of people were hoping it would be.

1662
01:53:06,375 --> 01:53:08,097
[SPEAKER_08]: On disc, DLC.

1663
01:53:08,177 --> 01:53:10,320
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of the things that will be remembered for forever.

1664
01:53:10,981 --> 01:53:14,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, Street Fighter X Tekken wasn't the only game that was supposed to happen there.

1665
01:53:14,562 --> 01:53:22,965
[SPEAKER_08]: There was supposed to be another game, Tekken X Street Fighter, which was Namco's version of the game, basically, as more of a Tekken-style fighter.

1666
01:53:23,785 --> 01:53:25,065
[SPEAKER_08]: No news on that in a while.

1667
01:53:25,826 --> 01:53:30,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But producer Katsuhiro Harada, responding to a fan on Twitter, said, quote,

1668
01:53:33,968 --> 01:54:01,591
[SPEAKER_08]: that's why we don't say anything so a lot of people are speculating that based on that message oh they're going to move it up to PlayStation 4 and the new Xbox as opposed to the current gen which would make a lot of sense it would also kind of give them a chance to really reinvent some things and hopefully make people forget about the fact that they didn't care for Street Fighter X Tekken so can't really see how this is bad news except the fact that it's going to be a little while longer before this game comes out

1669
01:54:02,151 --> 01:54:03,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Sakura, any interest?

1670
01:54:03,232 --> 01:54:04,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're a fighting girl fan.

1671
01:54:05,033 --> 01:54:07,795
[SPEAKER_08]: You are a fighting game girl fan.

1672
01:54:08,115 --> 01:54:10,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you excited about Tekken Cross Street Fighter?

1673
01:54:11,857 --> 01:54:13,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reserving judgment.

1674
01:54:13,959 --> 01:54:15,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to get it right away.

1675
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:16,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1676
01:54:17,241 --> 01:54:19,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless that trailer comes out and you're like, oh my god.

1677
01:54:19,522 --> 01:54:20,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, Jin.

1678
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:21,304
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, Ryu.

1679
01:54:22,224 --> 01:54:22,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

1680
01:54:22,865 --> 01:54:24,506
[SPEAKER_08]: I like even this little teaser image.

1681
01:54:24,626 --> 01:54:25,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryu looks great.

1682
01:54:25,586 --> 01:54:27,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I like him kind of Tekken style.

1683
01:54:27,207 --> 01:54:27,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1684
01:54:28,348 --> 01:54:35,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've, you know, I even have to say that I've always been a fan of the Street Fighter characters done in the style of another game.

1685
01:54:35,974 --> 01:54:36,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, remember SNK?

1686
01:54:37,996 --> 01:54:40,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved their renditions of the Street Fighter characters.

1687
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:47,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Not on the show roll tonight, but I want to say I heard that CVS2 is supposed to be coming out for PlayStation Classics or something like that.

1688
01:54:48,185 --> 01:54:49,586
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can get it on PS3.

1689
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:53,001
[SPEAKER_02]: That would sort of be a big why for me.

1690
01:54:53,021 --> 01:54:53,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's awesome.

1691
01:54:53,802 --> 01:54:54,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've already got it.

1692
01:54:55,262 --> 01:54:55,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1693
01:54:56,523 --> 01:55:00,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see it re-released so you could do like online battles would be pretty cool.

1694
01:55:00,545 --> 01:55:01,505
[SPEAKER_02]: For matching service.

1695
01:55:01,585 --> 01:55:04,047
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more games that say for matching service in the title.

1696
01:55:04,187 --> 01:55:04,707
[SPEAKER_08]: We do need.

1697
01:55:04,807 --> 01:55:10,990
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've actually got the Vampire Savior for matching service that I forgot completely that we actually owned that game.

1698
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:14,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might sell it.

1699
01:55:16,593 --> 01:55:19,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever read Gamer Girl's comment in chat here, Loki, about PID?

1700
01:55:20,115 --> 01:55:25,278
[SPEAKER_08]: PID is a side-scroller in which you play a little boy who gets lost and gets put on a planet and has to find his way home.

1701
01:55:25,758 --> 01:55:27,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And she gives you a link there to PID.

1702
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:29,220
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1703
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:40,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Tigerclaw, following up with the Mass Effect information from earlier, saying, There was some mention about the Mass Effect movie during that panel, but nothing like when it's coming out, because I don't think they've even started it.

1704
01:55:40,567 --> 01:55:41,568
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't even started it yet.

1705
01:55:42,168 --> 01:55:42,629
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1706
01:55:42,869 --> 01:55:55,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably see it out of morbid fascination, but I just wouldn't... For me, I am so deeply entrenched into the game playing as a female Shepard that to think of playing it as a guy is inconceivable to me.

1707
01:55:55,902 --> 01:55:59,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I really hope somebody puts their foot down and makes it a femme Shep.

1708
01:55:59,326 --> 01:55:59,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I can support that.

1709
01:56:00,006 --> 01:56:00,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I seriously do.

1710
01:56:00,487 --> 01:56:00,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do.

1711
01:56:01,848 --> 01:56:04,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be a great character, but...

1712
01:56:05,752 --> 01:56:06,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1713
01:56:06,433 --> 01:56:12,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I also kind of want them to really fuck with the fandom and do something really atrocious in the game.

1714
01:56:12,859 --> 01:56:16,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Like do a decision that like can't even happen in the game.

1715
01:56:17,063 --> 01:56:27,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Like have Kayden and Ashley survive Vermeier or like something that just totally like makes fan boys and fan girls just like, what are you doing?

1716
01:56:30,627 --> 01:56:31,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I really want that to happen.

1717
01:56:32,368 --> 01:56:35,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I want DarkSakura to twitch nervously when she's watching Mass Effect.

1718
01:56:35,549 --> 01:56:37,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I wouldn't care.

1719
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:38,711
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Garrus to die.

1720
01:56:38,751 --> 01:56:39,851
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1721
01:56:40,531 --> 01:56:40,912
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1722
01:56:41,812 --> 01:56:42,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, Rob.

1723
01:56:42,592 --> 01:56:44,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe you'd say something so horrible.

1724
01:56:44,573 --> 01:56:44,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1725
01:56:45,053 --> 01:56:45,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

1726
01:56:46,494 --> 01:56:48,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to leave right now to get my soda.

1727
01:56:50,766 --> 01:56:51,086
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1728
01:56:51,687 --> 01:56:53,388
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the part where we would do the mailbag.

1729
01:56:53,408 --> 01:56:54,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you.

1730
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:56,652
[SPEAKER_08]: But you didn't email us.

1731
01:56:56,752 --> 01:56:59,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Maybe you should do that for next time.

1732
01:57:00,515 --> 01:57:06,822
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead, we'll go right into the FUs of the week, even though this is really not a good time to be doing that, but it is what it is.

1733
01:57:23,218 --> 01:57:26,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my, um, I have two FUs really.

1734
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:34,423
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is to my iPad for not supporting Java so that I can sign up for something that Rob's going to be talking about later.

1735
01:57:36,144 --> 01:57:41,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, my other one goes to this stupid, um, bitch face that, okay, I actually have another one than that.

1736
01:57:42,266 --> 01:57:48,349
[SPEAKER_02]: To, um, bitch face number one who was in the car in front of me and one of those homeless guy panhandlers was outside and

1737
01:57:48,769 --> 01:57:56,854
[SPEAKER_02]: and she turned on her windshield wipers for the entire period of time that we were at the light and started flinging water at him.

1738
01:57:56,974 --> 01:57:59,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was clearly on purpose because her car was not dirty.

1739
01:58:00,097 --> 01:58:03,319
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see all the way through her windshield and back windshield.

1740
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:04,259
[SPEAKER_02]: She just did it to be a bitch.

1741
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gave him 50 cents and said I apologize on behalf of humanity.

1742
01:58:09,643 --> 01:58:10,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, but I did give him money.

1743
01:58:11,824 --> 01:58:15,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to my former boss bitch face.

1744
01:58:17,614 --> 01:58:18,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if you fuck with me.

1745
01:58:18,655 --> 01:58:19,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fuck with my friends.

1746
01:58:21,177 --> 01:58:21,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

1747
01:58:22,118 --> 01:58:22,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1748
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:30,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I guess I have to use the fact that my coworker's gone, so I got no one to talk to.

1749
01:58:32,948 --> 01:58:33,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1750
01:58:36,230 --> 01:58:37,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck my hand for being weak.

1751
01:58:38,032 --> 01:58:38,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Rob.

1752
01:58:40,514 --> 01:58:42,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I opened a bottle for DarkSakura.

1753
01:58:43,337 --> 01:58:44,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm strong.

1754
01:58:46,571 --> 01:58:47,832
[SPEAKER_18]: All the pressure builds up inside.

1755
01:58:48,652 --> 01:58:50,472
[SPEAKER_18]: And fuck the Mass Effect movie.

1756
01:58:51,993 --> 01:58:54,754
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to the freaking wild turkeys in this neighborhood.

1757
01:58:54,814 --> 01:58:56,094
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all assholes.

1758
01:58:56,675 --> 01:59:02,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, one of them literally flew right in front of my car today with a death wish, wanting me to hit it.

1759
01:59:02,177 --> 01:59:03,577
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to slam on the brakes.

1760
01:59:03,957 --> 01:59:07,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God there wasn't a car behind me or I probably would have been in an accident.

1761
01:59:07,158 --> 01:59:11,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably would have gotten whiplash thanks to this stupid fucking turkey that lives near here.

1762
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:13,441
[SPEAKER_08]: So, F you to the turkeys.

1763
01:59:13,541 --> 01:59:15,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you so stupid, turkeys?

1764
01:59:15,062 --> 01:59:16,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me!

1765
01:59:16,442 --> 01:59:22,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that actually turkeys were rated as one of the most stupid animals to live?

1766
01:59:22,985 --> 01:59:26,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank God we eat so many of them once a year.

1767
01:59:26,227 --> 01:59:27,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't eat the wild turkeys in this neighborhood.

1768
01:59:28,248 --> 01:59:29,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what the fuck they've been eating.

1769
01:59:29,309 --> 01:59:29,789
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

1770
01:59:30,109 --> 01:59:31,530
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably taste like radiation.

1771
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:34,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that does it for the FUs of the week.

1772
01:59:34,351 --> 01:59:41,896
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1773
01:59:42,576 --> 01:59:43,537
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, a couple stories.

1774
01:59:44,377 --> 01:59:57,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So, apparently there has been some research into video games and their effects on kids with dyslexia and actually allowing them to be able to read.

1775
01:59:58,946 --> 02:00:21,906
[SPEAKER_05]: and this is kind of cool they did a study basically where they had 20 kids 20 dyslexic children playing Rayman's Raving Rabbids which is crazy as it is for a total of 12 hours over 9 days and of course the game has a ton of crazy mini games and that kind of fun stuff and basically

1776
02:00:23,566 --> 02:00:35,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Before and after the nine days of game playing, the researchers tested the kids on several different tasks, including reading speed and accuracy, word recognition, and their ability to pay attention to multiple types of input, sight and sound at once.

1777
02:00:36,370 --> 02:00:39,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Before playing the games, the two groups were...

1778
02:00:40,951 --> 02:00:50,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Both equivalent in these tasks, but after 12 hours of the games, the kids that played the minigames showed significant improvements in their ability to read.

1779
02:00:50,355 --> 02:00:55,798
[SPEAKER_05]: They read faster, more accurately, and they recognized more words than they had before the treatment.

1780
02:00:55,838 --> 02:01:01,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, the children that had played non-active minigames didn't do any better on the tasks.

1781
02:01:03,021 --> 02:01:04,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of neat.

1782
02:01:06,591 --> 02:01:10,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a great story with all the crap that video games get sometimes.

1783
02:01:11,115 --> 02:01:15,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad to hear something where it's bona fide showing that it's helping in a particular scenario here.

1784
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:18,582
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, helping children with this.

1785
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:19,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.

1786
02:01:19,603 --> 02:01:23,106
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost like all those years spent telling mom it improves my hand-eye coordination.

1787
02:01:23,146 --> 02:01:24,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Like now there's the science to back it up.

1788
02:01:25,828 --> 02:01:54,681
[SPEAKER_02]: but the science has always been there I mean for the sake of reading and this is something actually we learn in typography the human brain will read lowercase letters better than it will read anything that's all caps a good reader reads the shape of the words not the individual letters so doing something that's going to improve time cognition for getting instinctive action over slow and methodical picking it out would definitely I think improve that skill when it comes to actually reading a shape of a word

1789
02:01:55,512 --> 02:02:04,500
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's really funny because when I was studying broadcast journalism, whenever you look at scripts for TV shows and stuff or the teleprompters, everything's always written in caps.

1790
02:02:05,161 --> 02:02:08,504
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not, you know, everybody makes that joke like, why are you yelling though?

1791
02:02:08,784 --> 02:02:11,026
[SPEAKER_08]: But they actually say it's to make you slow down.

1792
02:02:11,447 --> 02:02:12,788
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they write scripts like that.

1793
02:02:13,248 --> 02:02:13,608
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

1794
02:02:14,369 --> 02:02:16,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's the opposite of what you're saying.

1795
02:02:16,691 --> 02:02:17,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say one more thing on the subject.

1796
02:02:19,533 --> 02:02:26,358
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing a study of different types of readers, you know, basically really slow, really low-level readers and then higher-level readers.

1797
02:02:27,058 --> 02:02:31,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And they timed blink rates and pause rates for when people were reading.

1798
02:02:32,362 --> 02:02:40,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And the slower readers would blink and pause more often, usually in the middle of a word as opposed to at the end of sections of words.

1799
02:02:40,507 --> 02:02:40,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1800
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:44,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragnarok Online 2 Legend of the Second Music done by Yoko Kanno

1801
02:03:06,289 --> 02:03:06,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1802
02:03:06,909 --> 02:03:07,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1803
02:03:07,269 --> 02:03:08,150
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

1804
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:12,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently this game is now finally almost here.

1805
02:03:12,391 --> 02:03:15,072
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be in open beta in mid-April.

1806
02:03:15,452 --> 02:03:17,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Pre-registration is available.

1807
02:03:17,153 --> 02:03:19,113
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also check it out on the Facebook page.

1808
02:03:20,034 --> 02:03:22,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to check out this little trailer here in studio.

1809
02:03:22,355 --> 02:03:26,116
[SPEAKER_02]: If it goes anything like the last Ragnarok Online, it's going to be in beta for seven years.

1810
02:03:27,456 --> 02:03:28,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Most likely.

1811
02:03:31,058 --> 02:03:34,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to look at, is there any actual gameplay in this video or is it just a bunch of freaking like cut scenes?

1812
02:03:34,781 --> 02:03:37,522
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but there's YouTube video from the alpha.

1813
02:03:37,883 --> 02:03:41,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Will I get to fight, what were they called, Prinnies?

1814
02:03:41,285 --> 02:03:43,426
[SPEAKER_08]: The little slime people?

1815
02:03:43,566 --> 02:03:44,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Pourings.

1816
02:03:44,367 --> 02:03:44,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Pourings.

1817
02:03:45,788 --> 02:03:47,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Prinnies are the dudes from Disgaea.

1818
02:03:47,449 --> 02:03:47,809
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I thinking?

1819
02:03:47,829 --> 02:03:50,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, the outfits look so awesome.

1820
02:03:50,771 --> 02:03:52,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, how long did I play Ragnarok online, Rob?

1821
02:03:53,033 --> 02:03:53,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1822
02:03:53,393 --> 02:03:54,654
[SPEAKER_08]: How long until they banned you?

1823
02:03:55,174 --> 02:03:55,874
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, they didn't.

1824
02:03:55,974 --> 02:03:59,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually played... Let's put it this way.

1825
02:03:59,256 --> 02:04:05,459
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go back and play the International Ragnarok Online right now, I can get all of my characters back and all of my old stuff because I was in the alpha.

1826
02:04:06,679 --> 02:04:09,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you're a super nerd and you have a badge to prove it.

1827
02:04:09,641 --> 02:04:10,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure do.

1828
02:04:10,861 --> 02:04:14,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let us know if you're able to get in the beta for Ragnarok Online 2 and don't get banned.

1829
02:04:15,465 --> 02:04:16,426
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never been banned!

1830
02:04:17,747 --> 02:04:18,828
[SPEAKER_08]: You're banned from this show.

1831
02:04:18,888 --> 02:04:19,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Get out.

1832
02:04:19,809 --> 02:04:23,513
[SPEAKER_16]: I used to be friends with some of the GMs.

1833
02:04:23,833 --> 02:04:24,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Shit.

1834
02:04:25,755 --> 02:04:29,778
[SPEAKER_08]: We are at the end of our news, so we're going to open up the Skype line.

1835
02:04:30,038 --> 02:04:31,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm hoping we're going to hear from some people.

1836
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:33,461
[SPEAKER_08]: that went to PAX East tonight.

1837
02:04:33,561 --> 02:04:35,463
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to open up the phones and see what happens.

1838
02:04:35,483 --> 02:04:38,985
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the toll-free number you can use to call.

1839
02:04:39,446 --> 02:04:42,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1840
02:04:42,808 --> 02:04:48,512
[SPEAKER_08]: But remember, if you do call us on Skype, you want to call Echo123 first just to test your connection.

1841
02:04:48,612 --> 02:04:50,454
[SPEAKER_08]: And, oh, phone's already lighting up.

1842
02:04:50,514 --> 02:04:51,074
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a call.

1843
02:04:51,755 --> 02:04:52,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1844
02:04:52,755 --> 02:04:53,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1845
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:55,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm driving recklessly, guys.

1846
02:05:12,279 --> 02:05:12,539
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1847
02:05:12,739 --> 02:05:13,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, stupid kids.

1848
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:15,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, about the people cutting through his yard?

1849
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:15,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1850
02:05:15,561 --> 02:05:15,921
[SPEAKER_08]: All these kids.

1851
02:05:15,941 --> 02:05:19,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the kids that decided once I locked it that they needed to teach me a lesson by tearing it down.

1852
02:05:21,083 --> 02:05:21,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them.

1853
02:05:21,483 --> 02:05:26,866
[SPEAKER_08]: And then didn't you get it all fixed and then like a little mini tornado took it out anyway or something?

1854
02:05:27,266 --> 02:05:28,586
[SPEAKER_06]: They took one of the other signs.

1855
02:05:28,666 --> 02:05:31,448
[SPEAKER_06]: The mini tornado took my 99 cent no trespassing sign.

1856
02:05:32,228 --> 02:05:33,769
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1857
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:51,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zaku

1858
02:06:14,591 --> 02:06:15,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Legend of Zaku

1859
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:45,062
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's just, he's basically saying, yeah, I'm just chill because I have to work the next morning and everything.

1860
02:06:45,102 --> 02:06:48,324
[SPEAKER_06]: But like Friday night, he's like, you know, bouncing off the walls and everything.

1861
02:06:49,065 --> 02:07:00,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to give that little insight to OLR that, you know, yeah, he's like, No, he actually does have a personality and it's a good one.

1862
02:07:04,269 --> 02:07:04,549
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1863
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:07,971
[SPEAKER_08]: So you got to meet a lot of people, right?

1864
02:07:08,592 --> 02:07:10,353
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt was there, right?

1865
02:07:10,533 --> 02:07:11,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I met SSJ100Matt a couple times.

1866
02:07:11,954 --> 02:07:13,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I met John from Critical Myth.

1867
02:07:14,776 --> 02:07:16,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Met up with him.

1868
02:07:16,397 --> 02:07:20,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Met up with Ranma and a bunch of people from the cosplay group that he's in.

1869
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:22,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Anime Jam Session.

1870
02:07:22,701 --> 02:07:23,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to meet Misty.

1871
02:07:24,482 --> 02:07:25,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And HitStun found us.

1872
02:07:26,703 --> 02:07:27,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1873
02:07:28,144 --> 02:07:30,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And met some other people from the community.

1874
02:07:30,245 --> 02:07:31,006
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good time.

1875
02:07:31,046 --> 02:07:31,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get to see Havoc978.

1876
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:37,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't go to the Bring Your Own Computer area all that often, so that's kind of where he hangs out.

1877
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:44,594
[SPEAKER_06]: But just comparing PAX East to PAX Prime, I can see why they're saying that PAX East is the real PAX.

1878
02:07:45,535 --> 02:07:47,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because that convention center is huge.

1879
02:07:47,776 --> 02:07:50,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if the one you went to was in this convention center.

1880
02:07:50,398 --> 02:07:56,621
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I went to the very first one that was at that other convention center downtown that I don't think they have it at anymore.

1881
02:07:56,661 --> 02:07:58,863
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same one that Anime Boston, I think, is at.

1882
02:08:00,064 --> 02:08:12,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so, yeah, it's the Boston Convention Center, which is, like, really close to the airport, which is great, because I'm so used to, like, in Los Angeles and Seattle, it's, like, a 40-minute cab ride to get from the airport to the convention center.

1883
02:08:12,292 --> 02:08:14,794
[SPEAKER_06]: In this one, it's, like, you know, 10 bucks, you know.

1884
02:08:15,094 --> 02:08:15,834
[SPEAKER_08]: We had that nice limo ride.

1885
02:08:15,854 --> 02:08:16,274
[SPEAKER_08]: We're rock stars.

1886
02:08:16,294 --> 02:08:17,115
[SPEAKER_08]: We're taking a limo.

1887
02:08:35,459 --> 02:08:40,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, when we did the DDR Freak moderator trip, they sprung for us to get limos from the... Must be nice.

1888
02:08:40,982 --> 02:08:42,743
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun in Las Vegas.

1889
02:08:42,763 --> 02:08:47,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't you get to ride the limos for the Windows 7, the Microsoft Windows thing?

1890
02:08:47,886 --> 02:08:49,647
[SPEAKER_08]: That was after that PAX.

1891
02:08:49,727 --> 02:08:51,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that was at E3, yeah.

1892
02:08:52,188 --> 02:08:54,830
[SPEAKER_08]: And that video we made that never got put on the internet, but whatever.

1893
02:08:55,130 --> 02:08:58,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they stopped at the one that me and Glenn did.

1894
02:08:58,832 --> 02:09:00,333
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the one they stopped at.

1895
02:09:01,104 --> 02:09:03,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, we can send you the raw assets if you want to cut something together.

1896
02:09:03,610 --> 02:09:05,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, no, that's not why we did it.

1897
02:09:07,685 --> 02:09:21,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So the thing that's kind of funny is because I did a podcast with the Boston Bastard Brigade and Electric Sisterhood and there was a whole bunch of other podcasters and we did a podcast that's going to be coming out this week sometime.

1898
02:09:22,055 --> 02:09:23,997
[SPEAKER_06]: We recorded it this morning at 10 a.m.

1899
02:09:24,997 --> 02:09:26,879
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually a lot of fun being in there.

1900
02:09:26,899 --> 02:09:28,139
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a roundtable type podcast.

1901
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:36,806
[SPEAKER_06]: But what struck me as interesting, and they had to cut off the end of the podcast because they were losing that room, was that they were treating this a lot like E3.

1902
02:09:37,906 --> 02:10:03,025
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're like what do you think of PAX what games did you play on the show floor and I couldn't get in that I'm like I think they missed the point of PAX I mean the show floor is a big part of it but PAX is so much bigger than that and you know some of the stuff that I saw at PAX that really blew me away was not on the show floor I walked in and this just you know hit my nostalgia bone two things hit my nostalgia bone I walked into one room it's really dark

1903
02:10:03,926 --> 02:10:10,450
[SPEAKER_06]: and all it had in there, and I'm not kidding, 16 fully functional Steel Battalions.

1904
02:10:11,850 --> 02:10:13,411
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds awesome.

1905
02:10:13,531 --> 02:10:18,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight of them were system link with the multiplayer game and then they had four playing the single player.

1906
02:10:18,294 --> 02:10:19,835
[SPEAKER_17]: That sounds like my house except I have two.

1907
02:10:22,464 --> 02:10:46,697
[SPEAKER_06]: 16 all fully functional and they had the one one enforcer who knew everything about the game and he was you know yelling at people kind of like military style and you know giving them you know kind of like the old kind of like the spiel that you would get from like mech core if you're doing the battle tech pods and stuff so that was really neat and then they had the classic console room and they actually did in the corner have like a Commodore 64 awesome with a five and a quarter inch disk drive

1908
02:10:47,057 --> 02:10:48,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I love it.

1909
02:11:11,267 --> 02:11:18,721
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's what sets PAX apart from E3 even though if you listen to most podcasts they're going to concentrate on the E3 aspects of PAX.

1910
02:11:20,205 --> 02:11:21,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Nino Cooney Capcom

1911
02:11:50,528 --> 02:11:55,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, the worst demo I've ever played.

1912
02:11:55,374 --> 02:11:57,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Ni No Kuni is no longer the worst demo I've ever played.

1913
02:11:57,856 --> 02:12:07,207
[SPEAKER_08]: You were probably still on the plane when we were doing Gaming Week, but I actually mentioned you and that whole thing in Gaming Week because I hated the demo as well.

1914
02:12:07,447 --> 02:12:10,911
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have friends that love Monster Hunter, and I'm like, I wouldn't know that from this demo.

1915
02:12:11,624 --> 02:12:17,107
[SPEAKER_06]: and so, yeah, I think I landed and you were on the classic game of the week when I got in my car from the airport.

1916
02:12:17,267 --> 02:12:18,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'll catch the podcast.

1917
02:12:19,488 --> 02:12:26,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I learned, okay, they're doing DuckTales and I'm like, they can't mess this up.

1918
02:12:26,812 --> 02:12:28,253
[SPEAKER_06]: How can Capcom mess this up?

1919
02:12:28,933 --> 02:12:33,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, you can't, I mean, it was perfect and stuff.

1920
02:12:33,716 --> 02:12:35,157
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to know how Capcom messed this up?

1921
02:12:35,357 --> 02:12:37,018
[SPEAKER_06]: They let the Pink Palace developers do it.

1922
02:12:37,907 --> 02:12:38,327
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1923
02:12:38,387 --> 02:12:39,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's how they messed it up at PAX.

1924
02:12:39,968 --> 02:12:40,168
[SPEAKER_06]: How?

1925
02:12:40,628 --> 02:12:43,210
[SPEAKER_06]: There was only one copy of the game in the entire city of Boston.

1926
02:12:45,071 --> 02:12:47,572
[SPEAKER_06]: One copy on one single kiosk.

1927
02:12:47,632 --> 02:12:49,213
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a seven minute demo.

1928
02:12:51,254 --> 02:12:55,957
[SPEAKER_06]: The line went around the corner of the booth and they had to cap it because it was already four hours long.

1929
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:58,880
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1930
02:13:20,029 --> 02:13:20,789
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1931
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:50,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was up there, and I asked the lady from Capcom, and I'm like, so why do you only have one kiosk of that?

1932
02:13:50,306 --> 02:13:51,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And she shot me this look.

1933
02:13:52,528 --> 02:13:55,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh my god, I wish you had not asked that question.

1934
02:13:55,811 --> 02:13:58,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is like an hour after they had unveiled that side of the booth.

1935
02:13:58,674 --> 02:13:59,915
[SPEAKER_06]: It was covered up until the panel.

1936
02:14:00,836 --> 02:14:04,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in order to save her, I was like, is that the million dollar question?

1937
02:14:04,439 --> 02:14:06,801
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, that's the five million dollar question.

1938
02:14:06,821 --> 02:14:07,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1939
02:14:08,317 --> 02:14:10,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So they knew.

1940
02:14:10,899 --> 02:14:15,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I think when everybody started singing in that panel, I think they realized they messed up only bringing one copy of the game.

1941
02:14:16,182 --> 02:14:19,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's because it's running on dev kits and they only have minimum amounts of dev kits.

1942
02:14:19,785 --> 02:14:26,529
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly my thought because remember, GDC is happening literally, what, tomorrow or Tuesday?

1943
02:14:26,549 --> 02:14:27,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it starts Tuesday.

1944
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:31,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, when GDC starts, all the dev kits are probably in San Francisco.

1945
02:14:32,333 --> 02:14:33,554
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't be in two places at once.

1946
02:14:33,574 --> 02:14:35,135
[SPEAKER_17]: No, Rob, Passover starts tomorrow.

1947
02:14:35,976 --> 02:14:36,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway...

1948
02:14:36,556 --> 02:14:41,078
[SPEAKER_06]: But what they could have done is since nobody's touching that stupid Dungeons & Dragons game, make that DuckTales.

1949
02:14:41,418 --> 02:14:42,698
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not stupid!

1950
02:14:42,898 --> 02:14:50,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Put on the last stage, you know, cover up the Dungeons & Dragons with like a really, you know, crude notebook paper and, you know, Sharpie saying DuckTales.

1951
02:14:52,101 --> 02:14:55,584
[SPEAKER_06]: and just do that and then that four hour wait would have been a two hour wait.

1952
02:14:56,685 --> 02:15:01,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you get the one dude come by, where's Dungeons and Dragons?

1953
02:15:01,850 --> 02:15:03,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard there was a Dungeons and Dragons game, I want to play it.

1954
02:15:03,851 --> 02:15:08,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, okay, the Dungeons and Dragons game is awesome and I probably would have played that if everyone else was over at DuckTales.

1955
02:15:09,917 --> 02:15:11,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you could have walked right up to play that one.

1956
02:15:13,209 --> 02:15:33,896
[SPEAKER_06]: but then there's the long line of everybody trying to watch DuckTales and what does it say about I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing so this is an open question what does this say about PAX in terms of game announcements considering this was not the only game announced there that the most excited people got over an announcement at PAX was a remake of an NES game

1957
02:15:35,077 --> 02:15:35,437
[SPEAKER_08]: IndieCulture

1958
02:15:57,863 --> 02:15:59,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Indie Games All these crazy ideas I actually played on an Ouya

1959
02:16:17,449 --> 02:16:18,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, they exist.

1960
02:16:19,170 --> 02:16:19,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It exists.

1961
02:16:20,091 --> 02:16:21,252
[SPEAKER_06]: The controller is terrible.

1962
02:16:23,713 --> 02:16:30,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unresponsive, but I actually played a game that actually makes use of that touchpad in a way that makes sense.

1963
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:33,119
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, in the same touchpad that's going to be on the PlayStation 4.

1964
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:35,221
[SPEAKER_06]: The game I played there is a Saturday morning RPG.

1965
02:16:35,901 --> 02:16:42,426
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an 8-bit kind of turn-based RPG, but with a lot of like, you know, like some of the minigames in there, you're playing Simon and...

1966
02:16:43,166 --> 02:16:44,026
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, stuff like that.

1967
02:16:44,046 --> 02:16:47,027
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about, like, basically Saturday morning cartoons are this kid's real life.

1968
02:16:47,967 --> 02:16:50,888
[SPEAKER_06]: But right before each battle, you scratch off stickers.

1969
02:16:51,548 --> 02:16:54,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what you use the touchpad for.

1970
02:16:54,509 --> 02:16:54,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1971
02:16:54,849 --> 02:16:56,270
[SPEAKER_06]: You act like you're scratching off a sticker.

1972
02:16:56,790 --> 02:16:57,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

1973
02:16:57,950 --> 02:17:00,811
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it was a neat game, and it's actually a launch title for the Ouya.

1974
02:17:01,751 --> 02:17:02,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So I played that a little bit.

1975
02:17:03,072 --> 02:17:06,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And the buttons on the Ouya controller, it's O-U-Y-A.

1976
02:17:07,113 --> 02:17:07,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

1977
02:17:08,467 --> 02:17:09,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's like, press O to do this.

1978
02:17:10,008 --> 02:17:14,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So I press what winds up being the A button on the controller because that's the circle button on the PlayStation controller.

1979
02:17:15,711 --> 02:17:17,111
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to take some getting used to.

1980
02:17:17,131 --> 02:17:19,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And even the developer said, I don't like the button placement.

1981
02:17:20,733 --> 02:17:22,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the way they did that.

1982
02:17:22,514 --> 02:17:24,415
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have been some kind of standard or something.

1983
02:17:25,396 --> 02:17:26,056
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did play that.

1984
02:17:26,296 --> 02:17:31,259
[SPEAKER_06]: But there were some other neat things that I saw that I wasn't able to get interviews with.

1985
02:17:31,479 --> 02:17:36,601
[SPEAKER_06]: For the hardcore of the hardcore, I'm talking like, I don't know if Dungeon Buster's in chat because this is up his alley.

1986
02:17:36,682 --> 02:17:37,422
[SPEAKER_08]: He is in chat.

1987
02:17:37,742 --> 02:17:38,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, he is in chat.

1988
02:17:38,824 --> 02:17:40,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Dungeon Busters, this is straight up your alley.

1989
02:17:40,926 --> 02:17:41,828
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's called Artemis.

1990
02:17:43,041 --> 02:18:11,876
[SPEAKER_06]: and this is a spacecraft simulator in the sense like the old Star Trek so imagine the Enterprise except it's multiplayer across PC, iPad, iPhone I think even Android and you are basically a crew member and so what they had set up they had them on laptops there and they had five stations you have your captain, your science officer your engineering officer, your navigation and your weapons guy

1991
02:18:13,197 --> 02:18:14,718
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're all cross-talking.

1992
02:18:14,798 --> 02:18:19,481
[SPEAKER_06]: You have your screen and the way they had it set up there is you had your screen that had like a radar and things you could do.

1993
02:18:19,821 --> 02:18:25,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they had a main screen that actually had the 3D render of what it was doing and they were all talking to each other.

1994
02:18:25,305 --> 02:18:28,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, turn the ship to 160 degrees.

1995
02:18:28,667 --> 02:18:29,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Get close.

1996
02:18:29,087 --> 02:18:30,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, comm officer, request docking.

1997
02:18:31,169 --> 02:18:38,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Comm officer will say, okay, we've got permission to dock and then the navigation perk guy would actually dock with the station and then battle stuff.

1998
02:18:38,914 --> 02:18:40,775
[SPEAKER_06]: They would look at, okay, when do I turn on the shields?

1999
02:18:41,255 --> 02:19:08,371
[SPEAKER_06]: and the captain would start yelling out orders and it's this social game where basically all of you are working together to fly the spaceship have space battles and I guess deliver cargo and stuff it was amazingly interesting I didn't get a chance to play it because it was a 20 minute demo so it was kind of hard to get in on it but that's actually out now and here's the thing about Artemis is that they don't like DRM

2000
02:19:09,144 --> 02:19:09,945
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2001
02:19:19,731 --> 02:19:47,394
[SPEAKER_06]: and they don't check for this so this is honor system but then you can send the game to five of your buddies as long as they're all flying on your ship so only one person has to buy the game for five people to fly the ship and play the game that's pretty cool it's kind of like a DS title where like everybody can download from the one person I don't know kind of it's kind of what I'm thinking of when you say that that's really cool so that was one of the games that I saw another game that a lot of people were probably talking about I don't know if you ever heard of this game called dive kick

2002
02:19:49,629 --> 02:19:50,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2003
02:19:51,410 --> 02:19:54,092
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the most complex fighting game ever.

2004
02:19:55,353 --> 02:19:57,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out for PlayStation 3 and Vita and stuff like that.

2005
02:19:57,975 --> 02:20:02,257
[SPEAKER_06]: The way they had it there was that they actually had an arcade style controller.

2006
02:20:02,738 --> 02:20:03,718
[SPEAKER_06]: There are two buttons.

2007
02:20:04,519 --> 02:20:07,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Dive and kick.

2008
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:09,782
[SPEAKER_06]: You select your character and there were five characters in the game.

2009
02:20:10,002 --> 02:20:14,145
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is kind of funny because the name of the character was Wolverine.

2010
02:20:14,685 --> 02:20:15,766
[SPEAKER_06]: They got a cease and desist letter.

2011
02:20:16,386 --> 02:20:18,588
[SPEAKER_06]: The name of that character is now redacted with a strike through it.

2012
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:28,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, in dive kick, it's the standard thing, and you have the little guy go, Okay, ready?

2013
02:20:28,426 --> 02:20:29,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Dive kick!

2014
02:20:29,467 --> 02:20:34,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can jump with the dive button, and then kick with the kick button.

2015
02:20:34,391 --> 02:20:35,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you just hit the kick button, you dive.

2016
02:20:36,033 --> 02:20:39,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's basically, whoever hits the other person first, it's a one-shot kill.

2017
02:20:40,757 --> 02:20:45,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though it shows all these health bars at the stop, but it's a one-hit thing, and you're basically just jumping and diving, and that's all you're doing.

2018
02:20:46,876 --> 02:20:50,610
[SPEAKER_06]: and it is the most hilarious, funny fighting game I've ever played.

2019
02:20:52,625 --> 02:20:55,686
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like you saw a lot of gems, really, like these little indie gems.

2020
02:20:55,766 --> 02:20:57,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not see a bad game.

2021
02:20:58,027 --> 02:20:58,447
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

2022
02:20:58,908 --> 02:20:59,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not see a bad game.

2023
02:20:59,968 --> 02:21:03,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in the card game, board game section, I did not see a bad game.

2024
02:21:03,889 --> 02:21:17,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there was like, it was, the area was probably just as big as the video game section, but they had the whole tabletop section and the entire perimeter of the tabletop section were vendors and people showing off tabletop games, you know, board games, card games, things like that.

2025
02:21:17,955 --> 02:21:18,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2026
02:21:19,137 --> 02:21:39,831
[SPEAKER_06]: and that was in there and that's where I actually played a game that I actually did buy a card game called Flame War which triggered my PTSD of the G4 forums thing because you're playing as a forum moderator trying to create threads, forum threads and then closing them but the way that you attack other players is you flame on their threads and all the cards have internet memes on them

2027
02:21:40,887 --> 02:21:52,895
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff and so I did buy it and you know one of the cards is the Banhammer and so people that were around in the G4 days they actually were selling a shirt of the Banhammer which was basically a hammer that said Ban in it and yes I did buy that shirt.

2028
02:21:52,915 --> 02:21:53,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course you have to.

2029
02:21:54,456 --> 02:21:58,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the Banhammer shirt so anybody that remembers me from the G4 days will appreciate that.

2030
02:21:58,519 --> 02:21:59,620
[SPEAKER_08]: That is amazing.

2031
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:02,201
[SPEAKER_08]: and some of the others.

2032
02:22:02,442 --> 02:22:07,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, you say PAX is a lot more than just the expo floor, the community and all that.

2033
02:22:07,985 --> 02:22:09,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw some pictures on Facebook.

2034
02:22:09,986 --> 02:22:12,708
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like you guys were up very late playing Cards Against Humanity.

2035
02:22:13,449 --> 02:22:19,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and that was pretty much like... At DragonCon, I'm used to seeing people in a circle playing Are You a Werewolf?

2036
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:21,494
[SPEAKER_06]: And here, everybody was playing Cards Against Humanity.

2037
02:22:22,875 --> 02:22:26,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they released the third expansion, which sold out on Saturday.

2038
02:22:27,507 --> 02:22:52,357
[SPEAKER_06]: but they also had these three Pax East exclusive packs that you could get and if you found them you got them and they were either in the swag bag or if you went to the Kickstarter room you could get it from them and they were handing them out so yeah Cards Against Humanity was huge at Pax a lot of people were playing that everywhere that you looked wow so I think that game took off

2039
02:22:53,559 --> 02:22:55,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a Kickstarter success story right there.

2040
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:58,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably street passed with about 11 billion people.

2041
02:22:59,362 --> 02:23:05,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I would have street passed with more if I kept at it, but I wound up filling all my pieces and completing Find Me.

2042
02:23:06,026 --> 02:23:06,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2043
02:23:07,226 --> 02:23:14,070
[SPEAKER_06]: But I now have, I think, over 1,000 street passes total, and that's from all the E3 and all the other stuff that I've done with it.

2044
02:23:14,170 --> 02:23:16,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm only up to 500, and I thought I had a ton.

2045
02:23:16,911 --> 02:23:21,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can see I thought I had a ton too, and then I was sitting next to somebody when I went into the rock band panel.

2046
02:23:21,174 --> 02:23:21,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

2047
02:23:22,114 --> 02:23:25,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is the only panel I went to, which was the behind the scenes, they named names and everything.

2048
02:23:25,657 --> 02:23:26,238
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.

2049
02:23:26,638 --> 02:23:27,599
[SPEAKER_06]: It's never going to be broadcast.

2050
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:30,782
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was sitting there and he had like 2,800.

2051
02:23:31,863 --> 02:23:35,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remarked on it and he just looked at me and he's like, I'm a cast member at Disney World.

2052
02:23:35,786 --> 02:23:36,246
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

2053
02:23:40,074 --> 02:23:48,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, and so the Rock Band panel was, you're never going to see it broadcast because they actually spent about 10 minutes saying, you know, we could get in so much trouble if you, you know.

2054
02:23:48,739 --> 02:23:52,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're looking right at like the IGN and the Polygon guys in the front row with their laptops out.

2055
02:23:52,822 --> 02:23:54,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And they kept looking and they're like, don't write this.

2056
02:23:54,963 --> 02:23:56,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Please don't write this because they actually were naming names.

2057
02:23:57,224 --> 02:23:57,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2058
02:23:57,905 --> 02:24:01,367
[SPEAKER_06]: And talking about, you know, here's what, here's where we fucked up.

2059
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:02,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Pearl Jam Rock Band

2060
02:24:27,277 --> 02:24:50,824
[SPEAKER_06]: but they actually showed video of concept video of that and how it was going to be about the Pearl Jam live experience because Pearl Jam is a very active bootlegging culture and live video so they were actually putting it around their and the video in the background was actually going to be video footage from a lot of these concerts iconic Pearl Jam concerts and it just for whatever reason it didn't work out and they then coughed and said Eddie Vedder

2061
02:24:54,005 --> 02:24:56,108
[SPEAKER_06]: but then they talked about yes we know you want Mews

2062
02:24:57,392 --> 02:25:25,808
[SPEAKER_06]: and they basically kind of explain how Muse something happened and that's why they don't have Muse they actually talked about Pink Floyd and actually how they made concept video of doing dreamscape type of stuff with Pink Floyd tracks the Beatles Pink style stuff and they actually had concept art that they sent off to Pink Floyd and it just didn't ever happen same Led Zeppelin also had a little bit of that they had some stuff like that and then they talked about the Guns N' Roses debacle and this is kind of the highlight of this

2063
02:25:26,508 --> 02:25:41,781
[SPEAKER_06]: was where apparently there was a leaked video that came out or a viral video that went out of an unnamed Harmonix employee, which everybody tried to name, saying, hey, we got the entire Guns N' Roses library, Appetite for Destruction, everything, and we're going to do this and this and this and this.

2064
02:25:42,691 --> 02:25:43,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan Rickert Game Informer

2065
02:25:58,155 --> 02:26:04,117
[SPEAKER_06]: is the person who actually made that video and made Harmonix's life a living hell for several months.

2066
02:26:17,981 --> 02:26:21,423
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I did get to because I do know both Nick Chester and John Drake.

2067
02:26:21,763 --> 02:26:24,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went up to see both of them during the show.

2068
02:26:24,364 --> 02:26:28,546
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't ask them what they were working on because I knew they couldn't tell me about that.

2069
02:26:29,046 --> 02:26:30,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked them, will I think it's cool?

2070
02:26:30,967 --> 02:26:33,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told them, hey, I've been with you guys since Frequency Days.

2071
02:26:33,508 --> 02:26:34,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And John looked at me.

2072
02:26:34,488 --> 02:26:35,809
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, you will find this cool.

2073
02:26:37,065 --> 02:26:38,466
[SPEAKER_06]: You will find what we're doing cool.

2074
02:26:38,487 --> 02:26:40,889
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hoping to announce it at E3.

2075
02:26:40,949 --> 02:26:42,871
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like 95% sure.

2076
02:26:42,891 --> 02:26:44,493
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't want to say anything more than that.

2077
02:26:45,253 --> 02:26:49,177
[SPEAKER_06]: But I told him, yeah, I was with you in the frequency and amplitude days and all that stuff.

2078
02:26:49,197 --> 02:26:56,385
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, it's not Rock Band, but considering what I like of Harmonix's past, he says, I will think that what they're coming up with is cool.

2079
02:26:56,965 --> 02:26:58,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's very excited about it.

2080
02:26:58,127 --> 02:26:59,448
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all I could get out of him.

2081
02:27:00,782 --> 02:27:08,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Well Bobby, it sure sounds like we missed a heck of a show I'm sad, but you know, it is what it is But anything else about PAX East you want to share with us?

2082
02:27:10,057 --> 02:27:38,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a whole ton of interviews I am going to be probably putting them out on my podcast or some of them on my podcast feed because I don't want to because if I did like one a week every week they would go until like June Tell me more about Saints Row 4 Well I did see Saints Row 4 and I'm going to break this news I told Rob about this because now Deep Silver is handling Saints Row 4 I have a very good relationship with Deep Silver

2083
02:27:40,334 --> 02:27:43,755
[SPEAKER_06]: So a THQ never gave me the time of day, but Deep Silver did.

2084
02:27:44,195 --> 02:27:51,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were showing Saints Row 4 to the press in the hotel that's connected to the convention center instead of having to wait in line.

2085
02:27:52,057 --> 02:27:56,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And also that way they weren't bumping people out of the line, bumping attendees.

2086
02:27:56,478 --> 02:27:57,759
[SPEAKER_06]: They had press in a different area.

2087
02:27:58,719 --> 02:28:22,372
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I went in there and it's the same video the same 10 minute video that they were showing everybody else and they had developers in there and they're like yeah interviews and stuff you know do interviews so I went up to our PR contact her name is Stephanie Shop she is amazing and I went up and Stephanie Shop also if you listen to my show she was responsible for getting the MechWarrior online and the Devolver digital and all those interviews the ones I did kind of in November

2088
02:28:23,352 --> 02:28:25,053
[SPEAKER_06]: She was responsible for setting all those up.

2089
02:28:26,774 --> 02:28:30,875
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, hey, so can I get an interview with one of the Saints Row guys, the developers?

2090
02:28:30,975 --> 02:28:32,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And she looked at me and said, no, you can't.

2091
02:28:34,397 --> 02:28:36,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, okay.

2092
02:28:36,518 --> 02:28:40,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, because I'd rather you do one of your long-form Skype interviews in a couple weeks with them.

2093
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:43,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, nice.

2094
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:44,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

2095
02:28:44,261 --> 02:28:51,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it would be a five to ten minute quickie interview there, and she's like, I'd rather you do one of your long-form ones with these guys.

2096
02:28:51,824 --> 02:28:52,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

2097
02:28:52,967 --> 02:28:54,288
[SPEAKER_08]: So you don't have a date yet though, right?

2098
02:28:54,368 --> 02:28:54,748
[SPEAKER_08]: But soon.

2099
02:28:54,888 --> 02:28:55,408
[SPEAKER_06]: No date.

2100
02:28:55,428 --> 02:28:57,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because she's heading off to GDC.

2101
02:28:57,850 --> 02:29:00,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not bugging her until after GDC.

2102
02:29:00,811 --> 02:29:01,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, sure.

2103
02:29:01,812 --> 02:29:04,373
[SPEAKER_06]: But she said she does want to do it in the next couple weeks.

2104
02:29:04,673 --> 02:29:05,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could be pretty soon.

2105
02:29:06,334 --> 02:29:06,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2106
02:29:07,374 --> 02:29:10,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it sounds like you made a lot of great connections at PAX East.

2107
02:29:10,036 --> 02:29:10,876
[SPEAKER_08]: You had a really good time.

2108
02:29:10,916 --> 02:29:12,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Making us all jealous we didn't go.

2109
02:29:13,578 --> 02:29:16,579
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, there's DragonCon and E3 hopefully.

2110
02:29:16,599 --> 02:29:18,360
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have a great time at DragonCon.

2111
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:20,041
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to have a great time at DragonCon.

2112
02:29:20,081 --> 02:29:21,302
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm seriously looking forward to it.

2113
02:29:21,382 --> 02:29:21,882
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be great.

2114
02:29:24,757 --> 02:29:26,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably do have more stories.

2115
02:29:26,638 --> 02:29:28,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a lot of other great indie games.

2116
02:29:28,458 --> 02:29:31,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Some that weren't even on the show floor that I got to see.

2117
02:29:31,639 --> 02:29:35,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Those interviews are going to be airing throughout the next couple weeks.

2118
02:29:35,460 --> 02:29:37,801
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be getting some review copies of those.

2119
02:29:39,141 --> 02:29:42,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good time to be a gamer.

2120
02:29:42,642 --> 02:29:43,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up with the hate.

2121
02:29:45,001 --> 02:29:51,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Of all the stuff, I did not see a single bad game, even looking through all the indie stuff.

2122
02:29:51,769 --> 02:29:53,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not see a single bad game.

2123
02:29:54,411 --> 02:29:59,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Transistor, I think that's the Supergiant games from Bastion.

2124
02:30:01,819 --> 02:30:04,082
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to know what my game of show is, it's that.

2125
02:30:04,582 --> 02:30:05,003
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

2126
02:30:06,007 --> 02:30:06,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

2127
02:30:28,092 --> 02:30:28,132
[SPEAKER_06]: S.J.

2128
02:30:28,152 --> 02:30:30,153
[SPEAKER_06]: 100 Matt says his girlfriend agrees with you.

2129
02:30:30,293 --> 02:30:31,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Transistor's the game of the show.

2130
02:30:31,414 --> 02:30:33,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't the talking sword thing happen in a Mercedes Lackey novel?

2131
02:30:54,412 --> 02:30:55,353
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually did.

2132
02:30:55,413 --> 02:30:58,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's distant enough that it's all right.

2133
02:30:58,616 --> 02:31:01,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Bobby, I know you're going to have plenty to say on the next episode of your show.

2134
02:31:01,719 --> 02:31:06,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine there's a person listening to this that doesn't know about your show, but just in case, please plug away.

2135
02:31:07,674 --> 02:31:15,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I am the opening band, not the band that you came to see, but I'll only be here for five or six songs and then I'll go away.

2136
02:31:17,064 --> 02:31:19,447
[SPEAKER_06]: An hour before OLR, 8 p.m.

2137
02:31:19,507 --> 02:31:20,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Eastern, 5 p.m.

2138
02:31:20,368 --> 02:31:21,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Pacific on Sunday nights.

2139
02:31:22,810 --> 02:31:28,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually it's me doing a monologue for 30 minutes, taking calls from Breakman for another 20 minutes, and then talking to you guys for 10 minutes.

2140
02:31:29,597 --> 02:31:33,838
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's my show and we've got a lot of great interviews coming up.

2141
02:31:34,259 --> 02:31:40,541
[SPEAKER_06]: A game book being put into iPad, an old style 80s game book, Steve Jackson's Sorcery.

2142
02:31:41,681 --> 02:31:45,922
[SPEAKER_06]: It plays like an Infocom text adventure as well but looks really great.

2143
02:31:45,942 --> 02:31:46,803
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk to them.

2144
02:31:48,083 --> 02:31:51,044
[SPEAKER_06]: An iPad brawler that does not use virtual controls.

2145
02:31:52,000 --> 02:32:21,353
[SPEAKER_06]: and it plays more like Fruit Ninja and it actually does work I do get to talk to Phoenix Online Studios with Cognition and the Silver Lining and the next game that they're doing with Jane Jensen I got to talk to Mommy's Best Games about guns, on top of guns and on top of guns Nathan Fouts, he's also been on Fox News a lot recently and we talk about why that happened and what he thinks of that so there's a lot of great content that I've got in my suitcase that is still locked up and sitting in the hallway because I ran in here

2146
02:32:21,613 --> 02:32:23,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright Bobby, go unpack.

2147
02:32:23,094 --> 02:32:25,034
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to let you go so we can get a couple more calls.

2148
02:32:25,115 --> 02:32:27,015
[SPEAKER_08]: But thanks so much for spending some time with us tonight.

2149
02:32:27,576 --> 02:32:28,236
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

2150
02:32:28,276 --> 02:32:32,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember, if Legend of Zaku calls in and he's all like, that's not him.

2151
02:32:33,918 --> 02:32:34,699
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really a funny guy.

2152
02:32:34,719 --> 02:32:35,279
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an act.

2153
02:32:35,979 --> 02:32:36,599
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an act.

2154
02:32:38,580 --> 02:32:43,044
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Bobby Blackwolf Show, calling out the OLR regulars tonight.

2155
02:32:43,765 --> 02:32:45,146
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, have a good one, Bobby.

2156
02:32:45,706 --> 02:32:46,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

2157
02:32:46,227 --> 02:32:46,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, bye.

2158
02:32:47,928 --> 02:32:49,570
[SPEAKER_08]: The one and only Bobby Blackwolf, everybody.

2159
02:32:49,910 --> 02:32:52,512
[SPEAKER_08]: We let him go a little long tonight, but you know what?

2160
02:32:52,873 --> 02:32:53,233
[SPEAKER_08]: It was good.

2161
02:32:53,713 --> 02:32:56,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited to hear from some people that were at PAX East.

2162
02:32:56,075 --> 02:32:59,659
[SPEAKER_08]: He always has us on our show, or he always has us on his show, so...

2163
02:33:00,239 --> 02:33:02,700
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the least we can do, and he has a lot of great info from the floor.

2164
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:07,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping we'll get some more PAX East-related calls, like maybe this next one that's coming in right now.

2165
02:33:07,742 --> 02:33:08,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2166
02:33:08,702 --> 02:33:09,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2167
02:33:09,662 --> 02:33:10,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's Legend of Zaku here.

2168
02:33:11,083 --> 02:33:12,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, were your ears burning?

2169
02:33:13,004 --> 02:33:14,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Because someone was just talking about you.

2170
02:33:15,364 --> 02:33:19,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I heard it in the car right over.

2171
02:33:19,266 --> 02:33:24,568
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard it right as the car was pulling up to my house.

2172
02:33:24,768 --> 02:33:26,328
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Zaku, is it all an act?

2173
02:33:26,809 --> 02:33:27,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this all an act?

2174
02:33:28,530 --> 02:33:36,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe, but I'm just going to sidebar and focus on the real task at hand, which was PAX East.

2175
02:33:37,732 --> 02:33:42,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well let's talk about the real reason why you called tonight, PAX East.

2176
02:33:42,993 --> 02:33:45,174
[SPEAKER_08]: So you were obviously at the show too, because you met Bobby.

2177
02:33:45,534 --> 02:33:46,054
[SPEAKER_08]: How was it?

2178
02:33:46,074 --> 02:33:48,054
[SPEAKER_15]: I was rooming with him, actually.

2179
02:33:48,294 --> 02:33:48,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Were you really?

2180
02:33:48,814 --> 02:33:49,574
[SPEAKER_15]: How awesome.

2181
02:33:49,814 --> 02:33:53,935
[SPEAKER_15]: But then it got shifted when we got into the other hotel.

2182
02:33:53,975 --> 02:33:56,596
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to say as to the reasons why, but...

2183
02:33:58,467 --> 02:34:01,349
[SPEAKER_15]: He knows it very well, and we'll leave it at that.

2184
02:34:01,709 --> 02:34:11,337
[SPEAKER_15]: But long story short, this PAX, the way I put it, it was average.

2185
02:34:11,697 --> 02:34:19,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Last year's PAX, amongst all the swag and the parties, it doesn't hold a candle.

2186
02:34:20,363 --> 02:34:25,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Case in point, Curse's PAX East party this year wasn't even open bar.

2187
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:32,443
[SPEAKER_15]: and they oversold it to the point where you only had one free drink and then everything else you had to pay at the cash bar.

2188
02:34:32,743 --> 02:34:38,366
[SPEAKER_05]: The economy is really... Sons of bitches closing the open bar?

2189
02:34:38,646 --> 02:34:40,086
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I came to this thing.

2190
02:34:43,388 --> 02:34:44,088
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what though?

2191
02:34:44,308 --> 02:34:45,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfectly legit.

2192
02:34:45,549 --> 02:34:48,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Pax East, not as good because they closed the open bar this year.

2193
02:34:48,891 --> 02:34:49,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them.

2194
02:34:51,530 --> 02:35:01,994
[SPEAKER_15]: That is true, and then, you know, it was surprising aside from trying my best to play some of these things, given the fact that there were lines just about everywhere.

2195
02:35:02,934 --> 02:35:05,135
[SPEAKER_15]: So I only got to play very few things.

2196
02:35:06,155 --> 02:35:09,076
[SPEAKER_15]: I was able to get Hawken, you know, play that game.

2197
02:35:09,236 --> 02:35:20,960
[SPEAKER_15]: I also tried out the NVIDIA Shield, the new handheld controller device that they have, which is kind of nifty, though, because it's using the latest version of Android.

2198
02:35:22,315 --> 02:35:27,800
[SPEAKER_15]: The latest one that you see on a Nexus 4 and the latest tablets, that's exactly the one they're running.

2199
02:35:29,121 --> 02:35:34,366
[SPEAKER_15]: It really feels like a top-tier device.

2200
02:35:35,206 --> 02:35:44,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not just bullshitting or anything, I'm just saying it also has touchscreen, but it feels like you're actually playing a recent current-gen console.

2201
02:35:50,177 --> 02:35:52,678
[SPEAKER_15]: The graphics are on par.

2202
02:35:52,698 --> 02:35:59,480
[SPEAKER_15]: They're like 360 graphics from launch titles.

2203
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:08,423
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gotten to the point where mobile's pretty much at or tailing right now the big boy consoles.

2204
02:36:10,804 --> 02:36:13,425
[SPEAKER_08]: You talked about a lot of these lines for games.

2205
02:36:13,485 --> 02:36:14,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you wait in any of them?

2206
02:36:15,025 --> 02:36:17,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you stand in that epic line to play DuckTales?

2207
02:36:18,101 --> 02:36:19,282
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's the thing.

2208
02:36:19,342 --> 02:36:25,245
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like I was just going around the con, around the expo hall.

2209
02:36:25,926 --> 02:36:30,409
[SPEAKER_15]: I did my best to try to score as much free swag as possible, but yeah, it was slim pickings this year.

2210
02:36:31,089 --> 02:36:32,210
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a fan of free stuff.

2211
02:36:32,250 --> 02:36:34,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be able to guess from your talk about the curse party.

2212
02:36:35,191 --> 02:36:38,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay, what fun nightlife did this PAX East have?

2213
02:36:38,814 --> 02:36:39,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything?

2214
02:36:40,405 --> 02:36:56,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I mean, most of the nightlife was either, you know, you went to the local bars near the hotels, which was like the day before the con, which is a pub crawl that basically stayed in one place because it took too long.

2215
02:36:57,429 --> 02:37:16,997
[SPEAKER_15]: But other than that, it was just like whatever you had in your room, if you had Cards Against Humanity, you were basically playing not only with your roommates, with your bunkmates, but with random strangers that would just like bring bottles of high-end liquor, like Johnny Walker, like a liter of Johnny Walker for that table.

2216
02:37:18,038 --> 02:37:20,098
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, we're taking big swigs of it.

2217
02:37:20,579 --> 02:37:23,120
[SPEAKER_15]: And as a result, I had to nurse a hangover this morning.

2218
02:37:24,159 --> 02:37:25,041
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just about to ask.

2219
02:37:25,261 --> 02:37:30,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, you know, your eyes are looking a little bit like you haven't slept in about four days.

2220
02:37:31,071 --> 02:37:33,795
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's like I puked this morning, so yeah.

2221
02:37:33,815 --> 02:37:34,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2222
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:40,081
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to say you have that sort of prize fighter look about you.

2223
02:37:40,741 --> 02:37:45,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I wasn't going to say he got in a fight, but he definitely has that whole, like, I had a hell of a weekend.

2224
02:37:45,423 --> 02:37:52,526
[SPEAKER_15]: My face was just crunching up, tightening up because I was lurching over the toilet trying to puke.

2225
02:37:52,546 --> 02:37:55,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you offering your sacrifices to the porcelain goddess?

2226
02:37:57,047 --> 02:37:58,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Porcelain goddess, yes.

2227
02:37:59,008 --> 02:38:00,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Sacrificing my dignity.

2228
02:38:03,978 --> 02:38:13,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Aside from the newer games that were out and the fact that they were just like... Aside from the lines and everything else, board games were pretty much another...

2229
02:38:14,878 --> 02:38:32,524
[SPEAKER_15]: another huge aspect of it it got to the point where I actually have gotten my girlfriend I know, well for those who probably can't see the camera but that's our weekend Spartacus Spartacus is that based on the TV show?

2230
02:38:33,184 --> 02:38:35,305
[SPEAKER_08]: yes how much full frontal is in the board game?

2231
02:38:36,805 --> 02:38:38,486
[SPEAKER_08]: how much full frontal is in the board game?

2232
02:38:39,606 --> 02:38:44,128
[SPEAKER_15]: none I know my girlfriend would be disappointed yeah

2233
02:38:45,077 --> 02:38:49,900
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all she watches it for, full frontal, and then her dad watches along with her for the boobs.

2234
02:38:51,662 --> 02:38:53,062
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of awkward, but alright.

2235
02:38:54,443 --> 02:39:08,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, everywhere, like, yeah, board games, like, it got to the point where it was like, at this point it's like, a good third board games, another third indie...

2236
02:39:09,935 --> 02:39:13,897
[SPEAKER_15]: or more importantly, probably like a quarter indeed, and then everything else.

2237
02:39:14,497 --> 02:39:16,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still waiting for Mass Effect Risk.

2238
02:39:17,058 --> 02:39:18,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me ask you one more question, Zaku.

2239
02:39:18,739 --> 02:39:26,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Since you say you weren't as big on PAX East this year as you were last year, what can PAX 2014 learn from this year?

2240
02:39:27,002 --> 02:39:32,004
[SPEAKER_08]: How can PAX East 2014 set up to be the most kick-ass one yet, besides open bars?

2241
02:39:33,044 --> 02:39:33,345
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2242
02:39:35,051 --> 02:39:41,523
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess it's the panels that I tried my best to actually go to.

2243
02:39:42,445 --> 02:39:47,414
[SPEAKER_15]: This year I did better in the fact that I did like one, two, three, four.

2244
02:39:48,114 --> 02:39:51,416
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I did like six panels, one of which I had to duck out because of my hangover.

2245
02:39:51,456 --> 02:39:54,577
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, it's gotten better.

2246
02:39:55,658 --> 02:39:57,418
[SPEAKER_15]: The content has gotten a lot better.

2247
02:39:57,579 --> 02:40:00,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, it still packs up pretty badly.

2248
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:04,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, the Bioshock panel fills up rather quickly.

2249
02:40:04,762 --> 02:40:05,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

2250
02:40:05,362 --> 02:40:10,185
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's just like trying to... I guess they can't please everybody.

2251
02:40:11,145 --> 02:40:15,647
[SPEAKER_15]: So the best they could do is stay where they are because their venue is...

2252
02:40:18,041 --> 02:40:18,481
[SPEAKER_15]: and many more.

2253
02:40:32,802 --> 02:40:33,282
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing about...

2254
02:40:55,495 --> 02:41:08,771
[SPEAKER_15]: The only cool thing about PAX this year was the classic gaming had, well, aside from having the standard setup, like one room dedicated to just classic gaming consoles, they had another one.

2255
02:41:08,811 --> 02:41:10,493
[SPEAKER_15]: It had a featured room.

2256
02:41:11,013 --> 02:41:12,896
[SPEAKER_15]: And this year's feature was Steel Battalion.

2257
02:41:13,136 --> 02:41:14,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, they had 12 of these.

2258
02:41:14,097 --> 02:41:14,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2259
02:41:16,035 --> 02:41:18,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Just playing Steel Battalion is not even fun.

2260
02:41:18,896 --> 02:41:19,536
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just work.

2261
02:41:20,517 --> 02:41:27,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Cockpit, start up the Mac's computer, do systems check, ignition.

2262
02:41:27,439 --> 02:41:30,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Next time it needs to come with some vodka, it'll be a whole lot better.

2263
02:41:30,681 --> 02:41:30,961
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2264
02:41:32,501 --> 02:41:34,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Zaku, I got to let you go so we can get more calls.

2265
02:41:34,402 --> 02:41:35,683
[SPEAKER_08]: But thanks so much for the report.

2266
02:41:35,863 --> 02:41:40,785
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad to hear at least you had a decent enough time so that you were regretting it this morning.

2267
02:41:42,148 --> 02:41:47,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, also they were giving away free Android Bluetooth controllers for Android-owned users.

2268
02:41:48,091 --> 02:41:48,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's mine?

2269
02:41:48,791 --> 02:41:49,071
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2270
02:41:49,431 --> 02:41:50,892
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Zaku, got to let you go, buddy.

2271
02:41:51,132 --> 02:41:51,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

2272
02:41:51,552 --> 02:41:54,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, bye.

2273
02:41:54,373 --> 02:41:56,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Props to Zaku, an OLR gold store.

2274
02:41:56,934 --> 02:41:57,575
[SPEAKER_08]: A gold store?

2275
02:41:57,855 --> 02:41:58,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he can have a whole store.

2276
02:41:59,155 --> 02:42:04,418
[SPEAKER_08]: A gold star for Zaku for doing a video call so we can actually see the Spartacus game that he bought.

2277
02:42:04,858 --> 02:42:05,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

2278
02:42:05,698 --> 02:42:14,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll see if anybody else wants to call 1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio Making us all jealous we weren't there You alright?

2279
02:42:15,545 --> 02:42:17,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw something terrifying What's that?

2280
02:42:17,967 --> 02:42:27,634
[SPEAKER_08]: A goblin shark That does sound terrifying They have retractable jaws Much less terrifying in this next phone call Hi!

2281
02:42:27,954 --> 02:42:29,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, what's up?

2282
02:42:29,135 --> 02:42:30,616
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2283
02:42:31,584 --> 02:43:00,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Catastrophic Moggy Nice to meet you I'd never get through You never get through, well you're here now Yay Hold on, the clock on the wall behind you 3.52 in the morning Yes Told you it was going to stay up for us I did say to DarkSakura I would We usually do our chatting when it's 4 in the morning for me And here you are, well what's up?

2284
02:43:01,681 --> 02:43:15,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to complain about region locking and how I'm so unexcited by the current news about consoles, but I thought, you've already had so much time, I thought I'd bring up something from weeks ago.

2285
02:43:15,490 --> 02:43:16,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, go for it.

2286
02:43:19,292 --> 02:43:24,315
[SPEAKER_01]: The last, oh, pardon me, sorry, I'm completely fumbling over my words now.

2287
02:43:24,415 --> 02:43:25,516
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright, I do it all the time.

2288
02:43:26,956 --> 02:43:29,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have to listen to three hours of it.

2289
02:43:30,677 --> 02:43:31,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

2290
02:43:32,577 --> 02:43:33,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I get to make fun of me.

2291
02:43:33,818 --> 02:43:34,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Me.

2292
02:43:35,338 --> 02:43:47,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Weeks ago, you were talking, I can't remember what it was about, about your other halves guesting on OLR.

2293
02:43:48,241 --> 02:43:54,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, for either your last episode... Go on.

2294
02:43:56,992 --> 02:43:57,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Go off, go!

2295
02:43:58,394 --> 02:44:03,999
[SPEAKER_01]: For your last episode, you should, um... He's on the internet!

2296
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:04,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2297
02:44:05,921 --> 02:44:06,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?

2298
02:44:06,602 --> 02:44:08,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It's four in the morning.

2299
02:44:08,804 --> 02:44:09,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Shh, quiet.

2300
02:44:10,326 --> 02:44:20,136
[SPEAKER_01]: For your last episode, you should have, um... Oh, for your E3 special, you should have the other half special with Alan, Dan, and, um... Nellie.

2301
02:44:20,822 --> 02:44:26,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelly, pardon, and with your mum being a guest correspondent.

2302
02:44:26,924 --> 02:44:28,084
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be hilarious.

2303
02:44:28,104 --> 02:44:30,685
[SPEAKER_08]: We've talked about them before, and I'm sure Dan and Alan would be down.

2304
02:44:30,745 --> 02:44:35,666
[SPEAKER_08]: It would just be about convincing Nelly that it's a really funny idea, but that might be difficult.

2305
02:44:35,746 --> 02:44:37,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Nelly would probably punch my husband.

2306
02:44:37,567 --> 02:44:40,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd have to be here to see that.

2307
02:44:40,987 --> 02:44:42,568
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to video it.

2308
02:44:44,252 --> 02:44:45,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it would have to be a video thing.

2309
02:44:45,633 --> 02:44:45,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2310
02:44:46,253 --> 02:44:55,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the only way I could see that happening is if we promised Nellie it was the last episode of the show ever because she'd be like, yay, Matt can have a life now.

2311
02:44:55,819 --> 02:45:01,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you should do it either for the last episode or for an E3 special.

2312
02:45:03,379 --> 02:45:04,300
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see, we'll see.

2313
02:45:04,400 --> 02:45:06,782
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be like we couldn't be bothered to show up, so our spouses do it.

2314
02:45:07,222 --> 02:45:10,765
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we've had a bunch of people calling in to talk about PAX East tonight.

2315
02:45:10,906 --> 02:45:14,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, you're a little far away, so I'm imagining you didn't make it to PAX East.

2316
02:45:14,549 --> 02:45:16,611
[SPEAKER_08]: But what do you think about everything you're hearing?

2317
02:45:17,391 --> 02:45:20,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I've not heard much news from PAX East.

2318
02:45:20,174 --> 02:45:22,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of what I've heard is from you.

2319
02:45:24,077 --> 02:45:27,080
[SPEAKER_01]: My biggest reaction is I wish DuckTales was coming to PC.

2320
02:45:28,613 --> 02:45:31,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a policy of not getting digital content on consoles.

2321
02:45:37,774 --> 02:45:38,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see why.

2322
02:45:38,715 --> 02:45:39,595
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what though?

2323
02:45:40,536 --> 02:45:45,619
[SPEAKER_01]: One time when you can't, it won't transfer over and at least with physical stuff you can trade it in.

2324
02:45:45,639 --> 02:45:47,760
[SPEAKER_01]: With digital stuff, he's stuck with it for now.

2325
02:45:48,101 --> 02:45:53,964
[SPEAKER_08]: If it does well enough though, if it does well enough, they'll put it on disk.

2326
02:45:54,084 --> 02:45:57,747
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's going to be on Xbox though, it shouldn't be that hard to port it to PC.

2327
02:45:58,928 --> 02:45:59,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.

2328
02:45:59,528 --> 02:46:04,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I've taken up too much of your time so I'll get off now.

2329
02:46:04,797 --> 02:46:05,298
[SPEAKER_08]: No worries.

2330
02:46:05,358 --> 02:46:07,339
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a pleasure to hear from you and to get to see you.

2331
02:46:07,819 --> 02:46:10,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know you got to shut up because people are trying to sleep.

2332
02:46:10,481 --> 02:46:13,583
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you for breaking all the rules in your household to call us tonight.

2333
02:46:14,383 --> 02:46:17,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting shut up tonight.

2334
02:46:17,846 --> 02:46:18,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2335
02:46:18,286 --> 02:46:18,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2336
02:46:18,706 --> 02:46:19,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2337
02:46:20,507 --> 02:46:22,188
[SPEAKER_08]: We got someone in trouble.

2338
02:46:22,208 --> 02:46:25,230
[SPEAKER_08]: We got someone in trouble.

2339
02:46:25,851 --> 02:46:27,572
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2340
02:46:27,592 --> 02:46:31,895
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2341
02:46:34,502 --> 02:46:35,443
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a great call though.

2342
02:46:36,685 --> 02:46:37,226
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true though.

2343
02:46:37,266 --> 02:46:41,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually, because I'm up around like four in the morning and usually that's right when he's on.

2344
02:46:41,913 --> 02:46:44,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So we end up chatting like about stuff.

2345
02:46:46,011 --> 02:46:50,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby and Actdeft in our chat room talking a little bit about the DuckTales on PC thing.

2346
02:46:51,154 --> 02:46:56,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft was convinced it was coming to PC and BlackWolf says his sources say it's a possibility eventually.

2347
02:46:57,398 --> 02:46:58,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Not at launch though.

2348
02:46:58,618 --> 02:47:03,741
[SPEAKER_05]: After all, Resident Evil 6 I think just or is about to come out on Steam.

2349
02:47:04,042 --> 02:47:07,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes PC's a little bit later so just hold out guys.

2350
02:47:07,584 --> 02:47:08,104
[SPEAKER_08]: It might happen.

2351
02:47:08,424 --> 02:47:09,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2352
02:47:09,365 --> 02:47:09,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2353
02:47:10,888 --> 02:47:15,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Anime Jam Session calling live from the mobile Jersey Mobile.

2354
02:47:15,291 --> 02:47:16,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy crap, it's all of you guys.

2355
02:47:16,652 --> 02:47:17,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you're not driving.

2356
02:47:19,013 --> 02:47:20,234
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm driving.

2357
02:47:20,494 --> 02:47:26,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay, I was going to say, because if Ranchan had been the one driving, we would have hung up.

2358
02:47:27,859 --> 02:47:30,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because you do not talk on your phone and drive.

2359
02:47:30,360 --> 02:47:31,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I do it all the time, don't listen to me.

2360
02:47:31,661 --> 02:47:33,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you're going to kill somebody, namely a turkey.

2361
02:47:33,602 --> 02:47:34,503
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not, no, I'm not.

2362
02:47:34,583 --> 02:47:34,743
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2363
02:47:37,441 --> 02:47:40,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, enough of DarkSakura's lecturing.

2364
02:47:40,904 --> 02:47:42,545
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are coming back from PAX East.

2365
02:47:42,585 --> 02:47:43,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have a good time?

2366
02:47:44,406 --> 02:47:45,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, yes.

2367
02:47:45,167 --> 02:47:56,235
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to let you know that as Executive Vice Chair of VOGCon East 2013, we went over attendance capacity with the special guest of Cards Against Humanity.

2368
02:47:56,615 --> 02:48:03,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to a total of 16 guests with special guest stars Johnny Walker Redd.

2369
02:48:04,243 --> 02:48:04,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, wait a minute.

2370
02:48:05,324 --> 02:48:09,366
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had two other callers so far tonight from VOG at PAX East.

2371
02:48:09,386 --> 02:48:11,607
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the first one to mention this con.

2372
02:48:11,667 --> 02:48:13,628
[SPEAKER_08]: What exactly ended up happening?

2373
02:48:18,311 --> 02:48:18,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

2374
02:48:19,311 --> 02:48:19,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we losing them?

2375
02:48:21,112 --> 02:48:21,512
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?

2376
02:48:21,552 --> 02:48:22,993
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of breaking in and out here.

2377
02:48:23,113 --> 02:48:23,814
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

2378
02:48:23,834 --> 02:48:24,874
[SPEAKER_04]: What ended up happening at this VOG con?

2379
02:48:31,317 --> 02:48:35,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, JoeVidea did alcohol bingo.

2380
02:48:36,959 --> 02:48:40,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Zaku went game over because he drank not as much as everybody else.

2381
02:48:43,660 --> 02:48:49,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did game plus inception equals game-ception.

2382
02:48:49,742 --> 02:48:50,742
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't say.

2383
02:48:52,002 --> 02:48:52,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2384
02:48:53,082 --> 02:48:54,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we were playing a dice game.

2385
02:48:54,743 --> 02:48:59,484
[SPEAKER_14]: The rules of the game were roll dice, make up rule, drink.

2386
02:49:01,755 --> 02:49:02,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the rules of the game.

2387
02:49:03,436 --> 02:49:03,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2388
02:49:04,997 --> 02:49:05,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Patent pending.

2389
02:49:08,099 --> 02:49:11,140
[SPEAKER_04]: The name of the game is called Game.

2390
02:49:13,342 --> 02:49:16,764
[SPEAKER_08]: How many minutes were you sober during PAX East?

2391
02:49:18,285 --> 02:49:19,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a bit.

2392
02:49:19,725 --> 02:49:21,066
[SPEAKER_04]: More or less, yeah.

2393
02:49:21,727 --> 02:49:25,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what did you guys see on the show floor that kicked ass?

2394
02:49:25,169 --> 02:49:26,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see anything out there?

2395
02:49:26,409 --> 02:49:30,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Or even if it wasn't on the show floor, like in a side room or a panel or whatever, what did you see that kicked ass?

2396
02:49:33,973 --> 02:49:37,856
[SPEAKER_08]: DuckTales Did you actually wait in that hideous line to play it?

2397
02:49:38,096 --> 02:49:39,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell no!

2398
02:49:39,997 --> 02:49:44,140
[SPEAKER_04]: No, DuckTales is one of those games where I will be buying it regardless.

2399
02:49:44,540 --> 02:49:45,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's true.

2400
02:49:46,001 --> 02:49:48,943
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't need a demo to sell you, huh?

2401
02:49:49,463 --> 02:49:49,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

2402
02:49:49,763 --> 02:49:51,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this, though.

2403
02:49:52,845 --> 02:49:56,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitch TV was having a giveaway for the DuckTales poster.

2404
02:49:56,627 --> 02:50:00,010
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted people to sing the DuckTales theme.

2405
02:50:00,210 --> 02:50:01,831
[SPEAKER_04]: My brother and Jove were there.

2406
02:50:02,071 --> 02:50:03,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to get Jove to sing.

2407
02:50:03,956 --> 02:50:04,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

2408
02:50:05,156 --> 02:50:16,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I went up there with my bro, and the camera was on us, and after we sang the song, dude in the booth was like, yeah, give the dude with the VOG shirt a poster, because he actually sang the words.

2409
02:50:16,960 --> 02:50:17,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

2410
02:50:18,661 --> 02:50:21,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Way to, good job name checking the station, too.

2411
02:50:21,582 --> 02:50:22,442
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always a good thing.

2412
02:50:23,563 --> 02:50:24,883
[SPEAKER_08]: We love... Well, we got...

2413
02:50:26,991 --> 02:50:31,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we gotta thank Uk-chan for that because of how big the VOG logo is on our shirts.

2414
02:50:32,193 --> 02:50:33,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

2415
02:50:33,274 --> 02:50:34,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

2416
02:50:35,235 --> 02:50:45,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I know you guys are on your way home and you gotta get there safe and everything, but since you guys are gonna be talking about this undoubtedly on Anime Jam Session this Tuesday, what do we have to look forward to?

2417
02:50:46,660 --> 02:50:47,801
[SPEAKER_04]: A complete review.

2418
02:50:47,821 --> 02:50:49,362
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole lot of stuff.

2419
02:50:49,522 --> 02:50:51,163
[SPEAKER_04]: But before we go, a couple of things.

2420
02:50:51,543 --> 02:50:55,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Another game that's worth picking up is LEGO City Undercover.

2421
02:50:55,785 --> 02:50:56,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

2422
02:50:56,205 --> 02:50:56,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2423
02:50:57,745 --> 02:51:00,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, are you a fan of the Shawshank Redemption?

2424
02:51:00,886 --> 02:51:01,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2425
02:51:04,166 --> 02:51:08,807
[SPEAKER_04]: The game has a lot of pop culture references, including a scene from the Shawshank Redemption.

2426
02:51:08,967 --> 02:51:11,307
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of random in a Lego game.

2427
02:51:11,327 --> 02:51:12,808
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a prison break.

2428
02:51:12,908 --> 02:51:19,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, you have to go undercover into a prison and talk to one of the characters.

2429
02:51:19,909 --> 02:51:21,249
[SPEAKER_13]: The character's name is Blue.

2430
02:51:22,469 --> 02:51:23,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

2431
02:51:24,630 --> 02:51:26,850
[SPEAKER_13]: And he starts talking like Morgan Freeman.

2432
02:51:28,806 --> 02:51:33,248
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of the stuff he says, I was kind of hearing it.

2433
02:51:33,288 --> 02:51:35,149
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, why do I know this?

2434
02:51:36,069 --> 02:51:38,490
[SPEAKER_13]: And then he said something and I'm like, blue.

2435
02:51:38,570 --> 02:51:41,172
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, oh crap, it's Shawshank!

2436
02:51:42,409 --> 02:51:42,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh!

2437
02:51:42,489 --> 02:51:42,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh!

2438
02:52:12,256 --> 02:52:13,197
[SPEAKER_04]: That was bad.

2439
02:52:13,477 --> 02:52:17,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as bad as the Nvidia Shield controller.

2440
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:20,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, was that on the show floor?

2441
02:52:21,461 --> 02:52:22,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I played it.

2442
02:52:22,321 --> 02:52:25,363
[SPEAKER_04]: The controls were... The controlling was weak.

2443
02:52:26,764 --> 02:52:29,745
[SPEAKER_04]: The outline for doing the directional cross was really bad.

2444
02:52:30,145 --> 02:52:33,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And the demo game was Sonic 4.

2445
02:52:34,127 --> 02:52:38,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the song would end, it would pause for a half second and replay the track again.

2446
02:52:38,988 --> 02:52:40,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, no.

2447
02:52:40,389 --> 02:52:40,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Lord.

2448
02:52:41,669 --> 02:52:44,330
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Bobby was not a big fan of the Ouya controller.

2449
02:52:45,050 --> 02:52:47,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get to see that in comparison to the NVIDIA one?

2450
02:52:49,469 --> 02:52:52,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not know that Ouya was on display.

2451
02:52:52,630 --> 02:52:53,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not know.

2452
02:52:53,731 --> 02:52:55,872
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not enough time to see everything at one pass.

2453
02:52:55,892 --> 02:52:56,452
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

2454
02:52:56,472 --> 02:52:57,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be getting in like a week.

2455
02:52:59,474 --> 02:52:59,854
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2456
02:53:00,795 --> 02:53:02,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2457
02:53:03,256 --> 02:53:05,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to let you go, guys, so we can go wrap up the show.

2458
02:53:05,357 --> 02:53:06,918
[SPEAKER_08]: But any other last thoughts on PAX?

2459
02:53:09,279 --> 02:53:13,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your butts out here for 2014 so we can do VOGCon 2014.

2460
02:53:13,581 --> 02:53:15,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately for ActDeft,

2461
02:53:15,512 --> 02:53:17,153
[SPEAKER_04]: since he's a staffer, he does tech.

2462
02:53:17,453 --> 02:53:23,114
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be staffing the con for all three days, so by the time he gets off a shift, all the fun stuff's already happened.

2463
02:53:24,855 --> 02:53:25,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Womp womp.

2464
02:53:27,416 --> 02:53:34,718
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, though, VOGCon 2013 is DragonCon, and you got to Atlanta for one con this year, so I expect you're going to be able to make it twice.

2465
02:53:35,998 --> 02:53:37,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, look at it this way.

2466
02:53:37,819 --> 02:53:41,120
[SPEAKER_04]: If I graduate from college, I get those marks, and I land the job,

2467
02:53:41,673 --> 02:53:48,837
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be partying our fabulous little asses off Awesome, we can play game Yes!

2468
02:53:50,398 --> 02:53:51,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I challenge you to game

2469
02:53:53,646 --> 02:53:56,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a challenge, that's a fun thing to do!

2470
02:53:56,608 --> 02:53:59,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And you had to do it in deep Russian voices.

2471
02:54:00,111 --> 02:54:00,931
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

2472
02:54:01,311 --> 02:54:08,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be better than what we did at Faname, which was just the one bottle of Malibu and us going all over the place looking for a soda.

2473
02:54:08,877 --> 02:54:10,218
[SPEAKER_08]: How about this for the tagline?

2474
02:54:10,438 --> 02:54:13,040
[SPEAKER_08]: In Soviet Russia, gameplay you!

2475
02:54:14,298 --> 02:54:19,001
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it, and Ukchan, if we're going to do that, Jovidea will be there with our kinky vodka.

2476
02:54:19,442 --> 02:54:21,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, the kinky vodka was so good.

2477
02:54:21,543 --> 02:54:24,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm getting drunk off this conversation.

2478
02:54:24,385 --> 02:54:25,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma, I gotta let you go.

2479
02:54:25,626 --> 02:54:26,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, you guys.

2480
02:54:26,387 --> 02:54:30,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Big hello to all you guys at Anime Jam Session, Jovidea, and whoever else might be with you.

2481
02:54:30,930 --> 02:54:31,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, guys, okay?

2482
02:54:33,232 --> 02:54:34,012
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it, thank you.

2483
02:54:34,032 --> 02:54:34,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye!

2484
02:54:36,477 --> 02:54:36,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.

2485
02:54:37,217 --> 02:54:37,817
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys.

2486
02:54:37,897 --> 02:54:40,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, it is time I shut down the Skype line.

2487
02:54:40,098 --> 02:54:42,119
[SPEAKER_08]: We have been taking Skype calls for about 40 minutes, you know.

2488
02:54:42,379 --> 02:54:43,319
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of it was Bobby.

2489
02:54:43,999 --> 02:54:45,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yes, but, you know, with good reason.

2490
02:54:45,740 --> 02:54:49,181
[SPEAKER_08]: But we had a lot from Zaku and Magi and, you know, Ranma as well.

2491
02:54:49,201 --> 02:54:51,202
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate everybody who called.

2492
02:54:51,522 --> 02:54:54,683
[SPEAKER_08]: If you didn't get through tonight, but you have something to say, for the love of God, email us.

2493
02:54:54,823 --> 02:54:56,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2494
02:54:57,264 --> 02:54:59,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Give Dark Sakura some work to do next week.

2495
02:55:01,955 --> 02:55:05,076
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, some quick Twitter topics before I go for last-minute stories.

2496
02:55:05,676 --> 02:55:10,977
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw305 wants to remind us that XCOM Enemy Unknown was announced for iOS.

2497
02:55:11,337 --> 02:55:13,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot about this, but I did hear about this.

2498
02:55:14,117 --> 02:55:17,258
[SPEAKER_08]: They're talking about they're going to be charging probably a little more money for it.

2499
02:55:17,498 --> 02:55:19,459
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be a 99-cent game.

2500
02:55:19,559 --> 02:55:22,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Think more along the lines of a $15 game.

2501
02:55:22,499 --> 02:55:26,380
[SPEAKER_08]: But that would be in line with Squeenix pricing on iOS, so it would make a lot of sense.

2502
02:55:26,920 --> 02:55:31,544
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, they say it's going to be just like you're playing it on PC or any of those.

2503
02:55:31,664 --> 02:55:35,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, XCOM makes sense to be on iPad.

2504
02:55:35,127 --> 02:55:35,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It would work.

2505
02:55:36,448 --> 02:55:38,650
[SPEAKER_08]: iPhone would be a little too tiny.

2506
02:55:38,670 --> 02:55:39,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about that one.

2507
02:55:39,591 --> 02:55:41,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Even iPad Mini might be a little much.

2508
02:55:41,272 --> 02:55:41,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2509
02:55:43,595 --> 02:55:46,038
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura wanted to follow up on the rapid fire news.

2510
02:55:46,238 --> 02:55:52,025
[SPEAKER_08]: If you bought La Mulana on Playism or Desura, you will get a Steam key after April 15th.

2511
02:55:52,085 --> 02:55:54,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of you already are going to own this new La Mulana.

2512
02:55:55,909 --> 02:56:02,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Also for next week, since we're so close to 500 and with all the old school talk, can we air Best Hits Part 1 next week?

2513
02:56:04,487 --> 02:56:04,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

2514
02:56:05,187 --> 02:56:05,507
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2515
02:56:05,648 --> 02:56:06,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to promise anything yet.

2516
02:56:06,829 --> 02:56:08,029
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know what we might come up with.

2517
02:56:09,210 --> 02:56:15,456
[SPEAKER_08]: And Actdeft also posted a story about Dust and Elysian Tale that was covered in our Rapid Fire news earlier.

2518
02:56:15,516 --> 02:56:17,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Must have been in the restroom when we went over that.

2519
02:56:17,637 --> 02:56:21,801
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will say this story does say that a sequel may be in the works.

2520
02:56:22,161 --> 02:56:24,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, you know, game does well, sequel comes out.

2521
02:56:24,143 --> 02:56:25,304
[SPEAKER_08]: That's no big surprise there.

2522
02:56:26,304 --> 02:56:30,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us there and tweet us for a future week.

2523
02:56:31,472 --> 02:56:32,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Last Minute Stories tonight, Loki.

2524
02:56:33,734 --> 02:56:34,634
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of cool.

2525
02:56:34,714 --> 02:56:41,239
[SPEAKER_05]: They have put together this project called the Unleashed Project.

2526
02:56:41,259 --> 02:56:45,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it is, it's a total conversion for Sonic Generations.

2527
02:56:46,202 --> 02:56:47,663
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Sonic Unleashed.

2528
02:56:47,863 --> 02:56:52,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic Unleashed has been ported to PC completely.

2529
02:56:53,007 --> 02:56:54,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And it runs better than it did on console.

2530
02:56:55,108 --> 02:56:55,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice.

2531
02:56:56,409 --> 02:56:59,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're using the Generations engine.

2532
02:57:00,872 --> 02:57:00,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2533
02:57:01,624 --> 02:57:08,570
[SPEAKER_05]: And Unleashed, I'm talking about all the actual non-werewolf, werehog levels.

2534
02:57:09,111 --> 02:57:11,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about all the good levels.

2535
02:57:11,993 --> 02:57:12,654
[SPEAKER_08]: All the good ones.

2536
02:57:13,194 --> 02:57:13,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

2537
02:57:15,456 --> 02:57:16,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's it.

2538
02:57:16,992 --> 02:57:17,994
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's it.

2539
02:57:18,354 --> 02:57:21,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's going to wrap us up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2540
02:57:21,538 --> 02:57:32,812
[SPEAKER_08]: This episode's going to have to suit you for two weeks, but we've got an archive of about 497 episodes before this one, so if you need something to hold you over next week, go back and grab it.

2541
02:57:32,992 --> 02:57:34,894
[SPEAKER_08]: All the podcasts are still...

2542
02:57:35,715 --> 02:57:37,936
[SPEAKER_08]: on our server back through about 320.

2543
02:57:39,456 --> 02:57:41,297
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's plenty that are on the feed to grab.

2544
02:57:41,577 --> 02:57:45,538
[SPEAKER_08]: If you need something before that, hit up Dark Tetsuya, who's in our chat room.

2545
02:57:45,578 --> 02:57:53,740
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got the link to the OL Archive, where they dug up fucking episodes of Vanilla Sky and guys on a show.

2546
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:56,301
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably have your music show you used to do.

2547
02:57:56,321 --> 02:57:57,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody probably recorded that.

2548
02:57:57,841 --> 02:58:03,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Good lord, which was all like, if I had to go out and run errands, I'd just put on Eddie Izzard and I'd come back.

2549
02:58:03,783 --> 02:58:11,386
[SPEAKER_08]: People used to bootleg the shit out of Orange Lounge Radio, the station, so it's pretty, now all this time later, it's awesome that they did that, really.

2550
02:58:11,546 --> 02:58:15,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I am also planning this Wednesday to be in Turntable.

2551
02:58:16,376 --> 02:58:17,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I missed turntable.

2552
02:58:18,217 --> 02:58:18,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

2553
02:58:19,097 --> 02:58:23,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing basically what I used to do on my pump of the volume.

2554
02:58:23,140 --> 02:58:23,660
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

2555
02:58:23,701 --> 02:58:24,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed turntable.

2556
02:58:24,881 --> 02:58:25,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I always forget there.

2557
02:58:25,562 --> 02:58:26,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop in there with me, Robert.

2558
02:58:26,542 --> 02:58:27,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I very well might.

2559
02:58:27,423 --> 02:58:28,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Just let me know what night.

2560
02:58:28,364 --> 02:58:30,545
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as it isn't when, what's the night?

2561
02:58:30,565 --> 02:58:31,125
[SPEAKER_17]: I said Wednesday.

2562
02:58:31,286 --> 02:58:32,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Wednesday's Horde House.

2563
02:58:32,466 --> 02:58:33,287
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm dead after Horde House.

2564
02:58:33,487 --> 02:58:34,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, after Horde House is fine.

2565
02:58:35,088 --> 02:58:39,111
[SPEAKER_08]: This week is actually, I need to give this a shout out, Horde House episode 100 is this Wednesday.

2566
02:58:39,131 --> 02:58:39,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2567
02:58:39,331 --> 02:58:40,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, big milestone.

2568
02:58:40,252 --> 02:58:40,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Mazel tov.

2569
02:58:40,992 --> 02:58:42,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Giveaways on this week's show.

2570
02:58:43,093 --> 02:58:43,874
[SPEAKER_08]: So, unfortunately.

2571
02:58:43,894 --> 02:58:45,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me some interest in WoW.

2572
02:58:46,695 --> 02:58:47,816
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got the secret world.

2573
02:58:48,256 --> 02:58:53,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it because it was on sale for $22 instead of the full $30.

2574
02:58:53,758 --> 02:58:54,939
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't blame you.

2575
02:58:55,599 --> 02:58:56,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out.

2576
02:58:56,639 --> 02:58:57,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got yelled at for spending money.

2577
02:58:58,440 --> 02:59:00,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2578
02:59:01,121 --> 02:59:05,743
[SPEAKER_08]: We just want to thank you guys for tuning in, supporting Independent Radio.

2579
02:59:05,863 --> 02:59:11,145
[SPEAKER_08]: We just do this because somebody brought this up before, just kind of the whole talk about the family issue.

2580
02:59:12,645 --> 02:59:24,693
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys that are so enthusiastic about this show, there may not be 10,000 of you, but even the fact that there's five of you makes this so worth doing week in and week out.

2581
02:59:24,953 --> 02:59:30,636
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we are coming up on episode 500, has really made it worth it and why we've been stuck with it for so long.

2582
02:59:31,677 --> 02:59:32,918
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't charge for this show.

2583
02:59:33,338 --> 02:59:39,822
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to be asking you for $12,000 to do this here in person every other week.

2584
02:59:40,022 --> 02:59:41,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I am working on a gift for our listeners, though.

2585
02:59:42,944 --> 02:59:43,284
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

2586
02:59:43,364 --> 02:59:44,084
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about it earlier.

2587
02:59:44,104 --> 02:59:45,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2588
02:59:45,465 --> 02:59:46,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Tease that in a future way.

2589
02:59:46,365 --> 02:59:53,408
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just wanted to say... Unfortunately, though, we have to raise the limit of friends you have to... Or the minimum of friends you have to ask.

2590
02:59:53,448 --> 02:59:55,389
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to tell 500 of your friends.

2591
02:59:55,609 --> 02:59:56,029
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

2592
02:59:56,069 --> 02:59:56,329
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

2593
02:59:56,349 --> 02:59:57,710
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to tell way more of your friends.

2594
02:59:58,530 --> 02:59:59,891
[SPEAKER_02]: We have conventions we want to go to.

2595
03:00:00,011 --> 03:00:02,111
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't charge you guys to listen to this show.

2596
03:00:03,071 --> 03:00:08,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you it does not take $10,000 to put on this show.

2597
03:00:09,113 --> 03:00:14,695
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes passion and dedication and wanting to do it for the loyal listeners.

2598
03:00:14,935 --> 03:00:15,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is...

2599
03:00:16,275 --> 03:00:17,216
[SPEAKER_08]: What we get out of it.

2600
03:00:17,476 --> 03:00:20,039
[SPEAKER_08]: And so all we ask is help us grow our family.

2601
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:21,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Spread the word about the show.

2602
03:00:22,342 --> 03:00:23,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell a friend or two about it.

2603
03:00:23,563 --> 03:00:25,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Give us a thumbs up on Stitcher.

2604
03:00:25,965 --> 03:00:29,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're on Tumblr, reblog when I freaking post it and not just hit like.

2605
03:00:30,470 --> 03:00:33,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie is just here for her tumbles and wanting more followers.

2606
03:00:33,994 --> 03:00:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I've figured since I've been using my Tumblr to promote the show.

2607
03:00:39,352 --> 03:00:41,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also using my Mass Effect Tumblr to promote the show.

2608
03:00:43,056 --> 03:00:44,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't give me that, Rob.

2609
03:00:44,618 --> 03:00:44,938
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2610
03:00:45,519 --> 03:00:46,019
[SPEAKER_08]: That does it.

2611
03:00:46,119 --> 03:00:46,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, guys.

2612
03:00:46,960 --> 03:00:51,665
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought for these two weeks, and then we'll be back on April 7th.

2613
03:00:52,065 --> 03:00:53,387
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2614
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:54,400
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a headache.

2615
03:00:54,761 --> 03:00:55,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Stupid sinus infection.

2616
03:00:56,161 --> 03:00:56,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

2617
03:00:57,422 --> 03:01:00,424
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is hazelnut frappuccinos.

2618
03:01:00,644 --> 03:01:01,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty good.

2619
03:01:01,545 --> 03:01:02,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go get one.

2620
03:01:02,545 --> 03:01:03,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty good.

2621
03:01:03,606 --> 03:01:04,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Starbucks on the way?

2622
03:01:05,047 --> 03:01:05,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of them.

2623
03:01:05,647 --> 03:01:07,308
[SPEAKER_08]: It's open.

2624
03:01:07,428 --> 03:01:07,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Use the app.

2625
03:01:07,868 --> 03:01:09,489
[SPEAKER_08]: The app will tell you when they're closed.

2626
03:01:10,690 --> 03:01:11,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the app.

2627
03:01:11,270 --> 03:01:12,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Girl, get with the time.

2628
03:01:13,511 --> 03:01:14,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Last but not least, Loki.

2629
03:01:14,512 --> 03:01:15,012
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a grind.

2630
03:01:15,052 --> 03:01:15,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

2631
03:01:15,452 --> 03:01:16,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought.

2632
03:01:16,492 --> 03:01:33,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I'm not a huge fan of these games, it's really unfair that there's a Beatmania 3 final and a Keyboard Mania 3 final in Sacramento.

2633
03:01:34,118 --> 03:01:36,858
[SPEAKER_05]: They want $100 for both.

2634
03:01:36,998 --> 03:01:38,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, do you just want to split the price?

2635
03:01:38,319 --> 03:01:40,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take the Beatmania and you take the Keyboard Mania?

2636
03:01:40,079 --> 03:01:41,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Where am I going to put a Keyboard Mania in this house?

2637
03:01:42,060 --> 03:01:42,700
[SPEAKER_02]: In my backyard.

2638
03:01:43,841 --> 03:01:47,662
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can hold on to the other machine for me until we get a house, then yes, I'll do it.

2639
03:01:47,822 --> 03:01:48,483
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll talk to Dan.

2640
03:01:50,123 --> 03:01:54,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone's already bid on it, on one of them, so you gotta outbid them.

2641
03:01:54,865 --> 03:01:56,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, it's at $99.

2642
03:01:56,206 --> 03:01:57,626
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do what we can.

2643
03:01:58,587 --> 03:01:59,007
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2644
03:01:59,247 --> 03:02:00,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great week, everybody.

2645
03:02:00,307 --> 03:02:00,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Be safe.

2646
03:02:01,228 --> 03:02:02,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be a dick online.

2647
03:02:02,368 --> 03:02:04,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you guys won't be.

2648
03:02:04,689 --> 03:02:09,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope all you guys had a blast at PAX and have fun at Game Developers Conference if you're one of those guys going to that.

2649
03:02:10,813 --> 03:02:11,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Pixar didn't happen.

2650
03:02:12,155 --> 03:02:17,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll see you back here in a couple weeks on Orange Lawn Tradio episode 499 when we come back on April 7th.

2651
03:02:18,349 --> 03:02:19,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great week, everybody.

2652
03:02:19,712 --> 03:02:20,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.

2653
03:02:20,808 --> 03:02:23,830
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2654
03:02:24,471 --> 03:02:28,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

2655
03:02:29,274 --> 03:02:38,140
[SPEAKER_12]: To join us for a live show, tune in to VOGnetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

2656
03:02:38,780 --> 03:02:50,208
[SPEAKER_12]: The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

2657
03:02:51,208 --> 03:02:52,169
[SPEAKER_12]: See you next week!
