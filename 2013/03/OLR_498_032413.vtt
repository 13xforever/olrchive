00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, March 24th, 2013, new games are shown at PAX East

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Wii U shop age restrictions are lifted in Europe

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
and could an exploit in Origin allow malicious code on your PC?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Yeah, it's called Origin. Hi!

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Hey, that was my line.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Hello, everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.000 --> 00:48.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live for this March 24th, 2013, the 498th episode of our show.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining over the next few hours to talk about video games with my co-host.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Please say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm eating something evil thanks to Loki.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
And I totally stole her joke and it was funny.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
You bitch.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
I know. Here, here's a quarter for that joke. Here's a cup of coffee for that joke.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I love this coffee. It's very delicious.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Alright, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I ate so many breadsticks that my head hurts now.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Who's bringing the food? Supply and Oil, our studios with breadsticks.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
I ate most of it. It's just I couldn't finish the last two. I mean, ten was enough.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
You guys didn't know this, but every week at OLR is a potluck, you know, where everybody brings a dish.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
I bring the coffee, which is funny because Loki doesn't drink coffee.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Loki brings the pizza and breadsticks and DarkSakura brings...

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Healthy stuff.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Gross.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Salad and Chinese food.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Who wants that? Chinese food isn't that healthy.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I bring you coffee sometimes.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
It depends what you get at Chinese food, right? Depends what you get.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
I went to Panda and I had the Mandarin chicken with no sauce over vegetables and fried rice.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Delicious.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Alright, we're not a food show, believe it or not, but we are a show about video games.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
I'm sure PAX East, on a lot of your minds, we're going to be talking about some of the news that came out of PAX East.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Sadly, I didn't get a chance to go this year.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I went to PAX East the very first year, which was, I think, 2010, right?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I went to PAX East that year. I had a great time.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Sadly, it's a little tricky to get out to Boston from here, you know.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
That's a bit of a plane trip.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And just with my day job and everything, there was no way I was going to get out there this year.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
But I'll tell you what, y'all made me jealous through your Twitter updates and your forum posts and all that stuff I was watching.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Y'all made me jealous I wasn't at PAX East.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
But keep the pictures coming.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
I saw a lot of VOG people, it looked like, were in somebody's hotel room drinking responsibly, I hope.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Playing Cards Against Humanity at 3 a.m., pictures were going up.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
So, good times.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Very happy to see that all you guys are having a good time.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
I know we had some of our shows at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:46.000 --> 02:55.000
Remember, Orange Launch Radio does tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or VOGNetwork.com.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Not tonight, though, because Bobby is one of those folks that was at PAX East and he's on a plane home right now.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Yeah, Bobby. So this is now the Mass Effect show.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
I think the entire group from Anime Jam Session was there.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
I think Rama, Giovanni, Ari Rockefeller, they were all there.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
And Critical Myth, I know, was there.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Let's see, we're trying to think who else from VOG shows.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
I think that was it from the show shows, because obviously the gals from Britain didn't come out for it.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
And British Invaders, ones in Canada, ones in Britain.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I don't think they went out for it either.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
But certainly a lot of shows. So they'll be giving you some updates throughout the week.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm hoping some of our regulars, because a lot of our regulars were there.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Misty was there, Matt was there, Rama was there.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm hoping to get some calls from people a little later on tonight to talk about PAX East and all that good stuff.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
For now, though, we weren't there. We're going to get into the big news that came out of PAX East in a little bit.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I have to ask, because this is what I ask every time there's a PAX...

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
What was the Megafon event this year?

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh, I was watching SEG's Twitter and he posted it and I forgot already.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
It didn't sound like a new game or anything to me.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Maybe somebody in chat can help us out there.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Live.vognetwork.com is our chat room.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
And act deft in our chat room live tonight, confirming yes, Critical Myth, AJS, and Bobby Blackwall for all there.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
So, awesome. I'm looking forward to hearing their commentary on the show throughout the week.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
But the real party is here.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
That's right. And as we get closer to our 500th episode here at Orange Lounge Radio.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
One thing I wanted to talk about tonight, we were talking about just before we went live tonight.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
We were kind of looking back because, what was it? Somebody joined chat.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
What's this guy's name? Catastrophic Moggy joined chat.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yes.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
And I was getting that name confused in my head with a guy that used to be here locally that was Moogle Hunter.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I think it was his name or something like that.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yes.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
So we were talking about all these people from, I'm talking like the old school O.L.R. days.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Like back when we had the edit contest of the DDR machine and some of the people we had on the show.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
Like I was talking about, remember Rick and Paul and Dave, I was thinking about them.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
And we were thinking about it. We're like, God, I wonder where they are now.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
And I think Jamie had started to say, well, they were in high school or something like that.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I was going to a high paid school.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
Oh, and I was like, oh, my God, like Dave was like 17 back when the show started.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
He's like 27. He probably has kids now.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
So here's my little request for what it's worth.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And another old school person is in the mailbag tonight.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And I know we're going to get to that later.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
I would really love to hear from some of these really old school people that used to be on the show a long time ago.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
My house is open to you all that can make it on April 14th, which is the big show.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Bring me birthday presents.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
No, just so y'all know, no show next week.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
I'm registered.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Easter, Episode 499 is April 7th.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Is that right? Yeah, April 7th. And then Episode 500 is April 14th.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
So I would really love for the old school people to show up.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
I would love to see Anita, who I know is the DDR angel, if she can make it.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
You know, just some of the old school people would crack me up.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I chatted with her on Steam the other day. Yeah, it was nice.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah, yeah, I see her. I see her hubby on Google Plus all the time.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
We sometimes exchange our recipes and things, too. Sometimes.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Yeah, I know she runs a blog now and all that.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Her blog is awesome. It's called The Eco Maker.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Anyone who wants good home stuff, check it out.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
It was Space Team. Space Team. Is that an old school game?

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
No, it's a new Android mobile game. It's a cooperative team game or something.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I don't know.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
I heard a girl won, which is interesting because it was not Pork Buns.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
It was on the show last week, two weeks ago.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
The gal we had on the show last week, sadly, she got eliminated the first round in Bomberman.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
It's the curse of coming on OLR.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Come on this show after you're done with your competition.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Remember when we had that girl from The Tester on the show and then she was off the show?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
She was after it, though.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
That's true. It was all pre-taped.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Yeah.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
I still like to think there's a bit of a curse here at Orange Lounge Radio.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
So, yes. Episode 500, I want you old school Sacramento's DDR community.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I want you guys here in the house.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I remember trying to register that as an address.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Oh, really?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Why I had to get Sacbimani instead.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
You know who I know?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Because some Catholic organization registered it.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You know who I know would come?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Who?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
And who I am friends with on Facebook and I literally haven't seen.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
We just keep in touch on Facebook. Miss Janae.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And she married Dark Child. Did you know that?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yes. And she has a little one.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yes. They had a baby.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Yes.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
This show is so fucking old.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I don't have a baby. I have a cat.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
She's a lot better than a baby.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I have a cat, too. I love kitties.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
She doesn't drool on me. However, she does chew on cords.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Loki has a baby. Well, not even a baby anymore. He's like a toddler.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
You guys weren't bowling the other day, right?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
You have a small person.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
He's like almost three.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Oh, my God. The video was adorable, though. The bowling.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Did you guys have fun?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
That's a short video.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah. The long video. Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
He didn't let us bowl.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Because we have the little ramp thing.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Because he can't carry the ball.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I mean, the latest ball is like six pounds.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
He might be able to carry that, but I'm not going to have him carry a big ball that's got the oil from the lane on it and stuff.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
You know, with his feet. No, that's not a good idea.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
So he had fun just pushing it down the little ramp so that it would knock stuff over.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
But he wouldn't let us have a turn.

08:21.000 --> 08:33.000
I managed to bowl twice and my wife once and he bowled like, you know, two whole games worth of, you know, turns for three people.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Catastrophic Moggy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
What is this? A show about gaming or a trip down memory lane?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Now, I'm sure that comment is tongue in cheek and you don't really mean anything negative by it.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
But you know what? When you've been gaming with the same crowd for so long.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
And, you know, you guys have to remember when we did the DDR stuff, we were really heavy into Dance Dance Revolution.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
We would meet at the arcade every Wednesday.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
It was it was like clockwork every Wednesday or whatever day it was at the time.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
We'd go, we'd play some DDR for a few hours.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Then we'd go and have dinner, sit down.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
You kind of build up a little bit of a family.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
So, yeah, you know why? It is a little more than just video games.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
It's about family, just like a lot of my second cat.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
A lot of the same people turn up here and chat every week.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
I'm on my second cat.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I know. We've been through a lot.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
But we'll reminisce more in a couple of weeks.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Memory all alone.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
You just want an excuse to sing songs from cats.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
All right. Let's see. That's it.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
I think for the pre-week gaming banter, we'll get into the actual news from PAX East in a minute.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
But we're going to start off the show tonight, as we do always, talking about our gaming weeks

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
and the video games that we've been playing this week.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
DarkSakura.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
Of course, I played Mass Effect because I got the high-res mod working on Mass Effect 3.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You have all of it.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
No.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
OK.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
It's OK.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
I played, yeah, I played Mass Effect 3, got the high-res mod working,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
and then it started crashing whenever I would do the Tango.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
And I figured out that the problem was my coalesced.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
And I was what was doing it to me.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Because I had everything set by the old version of the high-res mod.

10:09.000 --> 10:16.000
And the new version doesn't require you to change any of your texture settings in the coalesced file.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
So I went and used my old coalesced file. Everything worked fine.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
The only problem that I have with it is that it makes all of James' textures black.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Just like the textures won't load on him.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
So I still don't know how to fix that.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Otherwise everything works and it looks beautiful.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Tango down. Tango down.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
But the cool thing about this mod is that one of the textures that comes with it

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
is one where you can sort of see Tali's face through her mask.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
And she's got the extra little bits they photoshopped on that one picture in Mass Effect 3

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
if you happen to be romancing her.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
So I thought it was a neat touch.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
She's got the little bits on her eyebrows.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
So anyway, I also played some Mass Effect 2.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Which I have now figured out how to use Ashley's skin and hair.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
Except with a completely different face structure so it doesn't quite look like Ashley.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
And I'm using Morin's outfit.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
So I've been playing around a little bit.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I've gotten the game to crash once. I was proud of myself.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
And then... I'm not doing the fandango act daft.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
I also started The Secret World.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
And the problem is that I've had a sinus infection all week.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
As I've said on a previous episode, this time of year, sinus infections.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Like you wouldn't believe. Allergies all over the place.

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
And so I got through the very beginning of the Templar scenario.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
And then I was like, oh my god, gunfire. My head hurts.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I can't look at this anymore. Bleh.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
So...

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
The Secret World's at MMO. I remember playing this too in beta.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Is it totally free now? Or is it paid a Guild Wars model?

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
You can pay a subscription and get all the premium shit.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Or you can buy a few things here and there.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I just have the completely freebie model.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
And it's okay. I haven't gotten too much into it. The control's alright.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
But I did sign up for the next Final Fantasy XIV beta.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
So hopefully that'll work out for me.

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
I haven't cancelled WoW yet. Every time I think I am, I was like, oh but I'll miss everybody.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Just a tip on that Final Fantasy XIV beta though.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
If you do get in, it's under NDA. And you're not even supposed to say if you're in the beta.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I know.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
Trust me, it would be a real shame if you got into the beta for Final Fantasy XIV.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
You couldn't talk about it on this show.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Even though you very much wanted to talk about everything that you were seeing in the beta.

12:45.000 --> 12:52.000
But you couldn't do that if you're under NDA. Trust me, I've heard from very close, very respected, very handsome sources.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
All I said is that I applied for it.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
I applied and said, yeah, I own every single one of these consoles that's on this list. What's your point?

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Except for the 3DS and the Vita. I own the good consoles on that list.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Hey, the Vita and the 3DS are cool.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
And god, I was going to play Mirror's Edge and Dan's like, you're going to throw up, you're going to get sick, don't play it, you're going to get sick, you're going to get sick.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I'm like, fine, I'm going to play it.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Yes, the show is on whoever you are, VOG155.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Tell us about your week. Don't re-chat.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Well, shit.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah, I played Mass Effect 3. Shut up, Raginator.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
So, uh, yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
Alright, see, they derail you when you go to look at chat when they're in mid-science, it derails you.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
It's just, most of the time, I didn't really have much of an energy to play much of anything.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Just because I was on so many damn sinus medicines.

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
Like, I was on Daquil, Sudafed, Benadryl, and Allegra in various doses, and then Nyquil.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Well, get better, dammit.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
I feel much better today. It's just, my nose feels like it's, you know, the Sahara.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
ActDeft is asking about Mirror's Edge. Was that something you were supposed to start this week?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah, that's what I was going to start this week was Mirror's Edge.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
And that's the one that Dan says, you're going to get sick.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I'm like, fine, I'm going to get sick, meh.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
It's pretty, though.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah, I'm going to play it. I just want to wait until, because the other problem is that all this week I've had bad equilibrium issues.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
And I don't know if I've made it evident to our lovely listeners yet, I've started drawing again.

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
And we actually rearranged the vault slash computer room to where I have my year old desk, pretty much, the table.

14:38.000 --> 14:45.000
And there is my drawing surface. So I've actually been dedicating quite a bit of time to rebuilding lost skills.

14:45.000 --> 14:54.000
And it's been, but I've been trying to, when I play a game, if I'm, you know, pausing at a point in it,

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
I'm actually starting to sketch out what's on my screen, just to sort of help me with proportion and space and distance and that type of thing.

15:01.000 --> 15:11.000
It's been a pretty interesting exercise. But I figured my first love has been, you know, video games and art. So why not?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And your second love is Garrus.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
My second love is Dan. Garrus is third.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Alright. Loki, how was your-

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Oh, followed by the Guardian Legend.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

15:22.000 --> 15:31.000
Let's see, I played Garry's Mod this week. I actually bought that on their little Steam sale that they have for some indie stuff. It was only three bucks.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
And I was trying to get to work with the game, you know, the Xbox 360 controller.

15:36.000 --> 15:43.000
And it's a little awkward because they don't have the keys mapped out quite correctly. So I couldn't really do a whole ton.

15:43.000 --> 15:50.000
And also I kept losing my gravity gun, which was kind of annoying because I can't arrange stuff without that.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
And so basically all I was able to do was throw a large iron beam in the air and crush myself with it.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And so that was kind of boring.

15:59.000 --> 16:06.000
Instead I went and tried to- well, that kind of prompted me to look into some other games that supported controllers.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
And I had Cave Story Plus, which I knew that supported controllers, but for some reason I couldn't find-

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
I didn't look, I guess, for the options for the controller support.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
And then I found it, and so I started playing that. And so I'm enjoying that quite a bit.

16:21.000 --> 16:29.000
I also played more Saints Row the Third, both on PC and Xbox 360.

16:29.000 --> 16:39.000
And going through grinding through the activities, man. I hope the next game doesn't do that.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
Oh, let me introduce you to these activities that you've played before. They didn't do that in the second game.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
They didn't even do that in the first game. They just had the activities there.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
The third game, half the missions are just like, hey, you have to do this activity for this reason,

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
even though it doesn't really quite apply to the game.

16:56.000 --> 17:05.000
Before Saints Row 2 and 1, it was like drug trafficking. Now it's merchandise trafficking.

17:05.000 --> 17:12.000
It's like, really? Come on, these guys are like big time gangsters now, and we're trafficking merchandise?

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Like bobbleheads and shit? That's kind of stupid.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
Or, you know, oh, hey, you're kind of even going along with that.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
There's like an escort mission where you have to escort them with a chopper.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It's like Guardian Angel is what it's called.

17:27.000 --> 17:33.000
And half the time you're firing rockets out of the side of a helicopter,

17:33.000 --> 17:40.000
and then the other time you're, for some reason, repelled down the side of a building and sniping.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Like, you could snipe on top of the building.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
You have to repel down the building a little bit for some damn reason to snipe.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
Because, you know, snipers never take position on roofs. They always repel halfway down the roof, you know.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
It just makes no sense.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
And it's one of the things I didn't really like originally in the game.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
That and the Saints book activities are kind of annoying too, but I haven't gotten to that again yet.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
Which is why I'm so pissed off that I lost my save in the first place, because I had all that shit done.

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
I was one activity, or one car theft away from completing all of the activities and all the Saints book stuff.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
And then, of course, you know, lost my save.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
So, that was fun.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
Unfortunately, I also had Bioshock Infinite to play.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
Haven't gotten the chance to do that, because I was cooking this morning.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
And also the Defiance Beta on 360.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
But, by the time I get to play it, the beta is going to be over and Defiance will be out next week.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Or, the week after next.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
All those Bioshock Infinite reviews ought to start hitting tomorrow, right?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Because the game's out Tuesday?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Yeah.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Am I right? Yeah.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Well, I mean, there was the one from IGN, because, you know.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
They bought it.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah, they bought it.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
But I'm sure the game's great.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
It's going to be fantastic.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I'm sure the game's great, yeah.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Unlike the Walking Dead game, holy shit.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
That's been a source of comedy this week, hasn't it?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
It's like, yeah.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
EA's been, I bet they're glad that, you know, the Walking Dead game.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
It's like, seriously, one company after the next.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I wonder who's going to have this shitty game next.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Is Injustice going to be any good?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I hope so.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Or, like, you know, maybe Defiance.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Because it is based off a sci-fi series.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
So, that's not absolutely positive.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Yeah, my money's on Injustice, actually.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
But, we'll see, we'll see.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I can't shade a game.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Dead Island Riptide, maybe.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I can't shade a game I haven't played Saints Row IV.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
That's a ways away.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Some of the feedback coming out of PAX East is pretty good.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Again, I can't shade a game I haven't played.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
That's the thing, that's what's confusing me.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Because, like, I've been, you know, I'm going to buy Saints Row IV.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Just because...

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
You're a whore for Saints Row, and that's fine.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
I like Saints Row, but at the same time, what they've shown me

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
isn't necessarily giving me the most confidence that this game's going to be good.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
Like, first off, Saints Row III, I really wish it was more toned back towards 2.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
2 was the best.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
It was, like, the best, you know, balance between, like, a gritty game

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
and, like, you know, ridiculous, you know.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
But then 3 just, like, we're just going to go crazy.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
And then 4, like, we're going even crazier.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Oh, and we're going to have a...

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
A dubstep gun.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Come on, that's hilarious.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
That's funny.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
We're going to have a...

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
We're going to have a...

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Was it a...

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
A lot of DLC, basically.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
I'm like, yeah, I remember the DLC from Saints Row III.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Your 20-minute mission.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
I need someone who is at PAX East and played the game to call in and tell...

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
No one played the game.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
No one played the game.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
They watched a video.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Oh.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
A short video.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
It wasn't playable?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Nope.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
10-minute video they watched.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
It would have been playable, but anyway.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
That's why it's not coming to the Wii.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
It's not because they fucking hate the Wii.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
It's because they have the engine done already and they're not going to port it.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
All right.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
That's it.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
My gaming week.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
I had a very Blizzard-tastic week because, obviously, I played a lot of WoW.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
I've been working on a Hunter, who's, like, my PvP character and been having fun with

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
her.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Did I mention last week on the show?

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
I can't remember when this happened, but I sold an item on the Real Money Auction House

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
on Diablo III.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
No, you didn't mention that.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Yes, I sold...

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Guess how much I made?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
A dollar.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I made 25 cents.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Yeah.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Woohoo.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Because the minimum you can list an item for is $1.25.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
So that's what I put the item up for.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
And then the transaction fee is always $1.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
No matter what it sells for.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
So $1.25 minus $1.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
25 cents, baby.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Woohoo.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
It worked for you.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
I can put that towards a card pack in Hearthstone, but we'll get to that later.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
So, yeah, I've been having fun with Diablo III, believe it or not.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Like, I'm just...

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I'm kind of into it right now.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
It's good.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Also, I played StarCraft.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
No, I did not play that new expansion, but all my friends kind of going back to StarCraft

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
because of that expansion made me want to load up the game.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
And I was like, whoa, the launcher, like, totally changed for this.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
But I loaded up Star Jeweled, because Star Jeweled is, like, the reason for me to play

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
StarCraft.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
And no, I don't have the new expansion.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
And until I sell about, oh, I don't know, 100 more items on that real money auction

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
house.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
I mean, if I can raise 40 bucks in Diablo III, I'll buy it.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
But if I make a quarter every two weeks, I don't think that's going to happen pretty

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
soon.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
So, there was that.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
I've been playing some console stuff, too.

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
I have to admit, I played the Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate demo on Wii U.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
The demo's awful, you guys.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
It is awful.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
And here's the thing.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
Like, I have friends that are really into that game right now that are, like, having

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
a lot of fun with it.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
And one way it was kind of described to me is that it's, like, Phantasy Star Online,

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
kind of, but a lot more grindy because it's a JRPG.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
But I played this demo on Wii U.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
And I just, like, the reason why I want to bring it up, not that I like to review games

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
based on the demo, but here's the reality.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
That's what happens.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
A lot of people do make their opinions based on the full game on the demo.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
I mean, we've heard Bobby to death on his show talking about the Ni No Kuni and how

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
he hated that demo.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And, yeah, that was a pretty shitty demo, too.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
And, again, here we have a case of a demo that's even worse.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Like, it just, it doesn't tell you anything about the game.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
It doesn't set up anything.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
What you're doing, there's this assumption that you'll just figure it out.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
And it's just unacceptable.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
Like, I can't figure out, like, why gaming companies don't know that or why they can't

23:24.000 --> 23:32.000
invest 25 cents to create a splash screen that at least kind of details, like, we're

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
throwing you midway into the game and here's what's going on and here's the controls.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
But I just thought it was fucking boring.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Like, it was seriously fucking boring.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
I got this guy with a giant sword and I figured out that the monster I wanted was on my mini

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
map.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
So I went to him and I button mashed to figure out what the attack buttons were for about

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
20 minutes.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
And, finally, I caught it and it was like, doo doo, demo done.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
And I was like, that was the most boring fucking thing I've done all week long.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Like, way to sell your game.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
And so now I'm like, okay, but my friends like really-

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Was laundry more fun?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
It was.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
Like, I know there are Monster Hunter fans that listen to this show that are like, Rob,

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
you're so ignorant.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
The demo doesn't show this.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I'm sorry.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
That doesn't work for me.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
Like, if the company is going to sell me on the game, sell me on the game.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
So now if I'm to be sold on this game, either I'm going to have to go play it at a friend's

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
house who's going to have to explain to me what's going on.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
Maybe I'll put it in my Gamefly queue, but it's not like something I'm like-

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
The urgency of doing so just dropped a whole lot.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Let me just put it that way.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
So, let's see.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Go into comments from chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
ActDef says, Rob, you need to play Team Fortress 2 more.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
You can sell stuff for over a hundred US dollars.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
You know, I actually like, I was seriously going to boot up Team Fortress 2 the other

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
night and then I got distracted and did something else.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
And it was because of like last week's show.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Orange Right in our chat room agrees with me about Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
That demo did not sell me on the game at all.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
And it's a pity.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And you know what?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And I kind of have to remind myself.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Ni No Kuni had a pretty bad demo too.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
But the full game's great.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
And like, I don't know what convinced me to take the leap of faith there.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Or like I refused to do it in Monster Hunter.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
But maybe because the Ni No Kuni demo, I kind of figured it out.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
And it was fun in the long run once I finally figured it out.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I don't know.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
One other game I played this week.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I just bought it today.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
So I haven't had a lot of time to play it.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
But I did buy Luigi's Mansion on 3DS.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
And so I've only got to do some of the early levels.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Like where you go into that first little mansion.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
I did not play the GameCube version.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
Which I know a lot of people might be like, what?

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
But I didn't get my GameCube until well after the launch stuff.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
In fact, I remember Loki bought me the GameCube.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
It's a really awesome present.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
When Animal Crossing came out.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Hell yeah.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
At that point, Animal Crossing was all the rage at that point.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
We didn't have time for Luigi's Mansion or any of the launch titles.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
So I never played the original one.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
But I've played the new one.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
But only a little bit.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
So I can't really give it a full review.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
But I will say, some pretty good 3D effects.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
And it really reminds me.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
And this is a compliment.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
It really reminds me of an old school PC game.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
Like just in the way you're kind of walking around the mansion on the top screen.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
And it's like you're finding items.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
It for some reason kind of reminds me of an old school puzzler.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Like an old LucasArts game almost.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
With a little more action though, obviously.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Because you're sucking in the ghosts and all that.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
And you can find him hanged.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
No multiplayer or anything like that yet.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Because I've literally only played the game like 30 minutes.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
So I can't tell you anymore about it at this time.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
But it was fun and the 3D effects were fun.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I like the whole little pixelator thing.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It looks like something out of Tron.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
That cracked me up.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
So, yeah. So Luigi's Mansion 3DS.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
And that was my gaming week.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
So, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Again, I think I mentioned this before.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
But I just want to make sure you all know there is no Orange Lounge Radio next week.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Have a great Easter or Sunday off.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
I'll be drunk on mimosas.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Will ya? Oh, from brunch?

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
No, where we're going for brunch, Murray Calendars, they give you like never-ending mimosas.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
A lot of places do that for brunch.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I'm so happy.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
That's like the friends that I have downtown that we like to go to brunch with all the time.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
Like, we can't go to a place unless they have endless mimosas.

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
Because our one friend is like, no, I'm not going if I can't get mimosas.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
So, good times.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Anyhow, so no show next week, but we will be back on April 7th.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
I believe Bobby's here next week.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
So, those of you guys that turn out here pretty loyally on Sunday night,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
you'll have something to look forward to next week.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
There may be a best of or something, but there won't be a pre-recorded show

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
because we're intentionally setting it up so that we know episode 500 is on this day.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
So, that way we can kind of plan a little bit.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Alright, I think that's it.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio, yada yada.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Let's get into gaming news. Loki.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
Well, this was completely unexpected, but Capcom announced, I guess,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
a little bit ahead of their World of Capcom panel.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
Or even, actually, I think it was teased before, but announced after World of Capcom panel

28:19.000 --> 28:26.000
that they're going to be remastering DuckTales, like the old NES DuckTales game,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
which is pretty fantastic.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
You should have seen the flappy hands I made when I heard that news.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
That was really unexpected.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Yes, very unexpected.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
And basically, it's going to have hand-drawn sprites.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
It's going to have all the original voices.

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
And it's coming to Wii U, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade, 15 bucks.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
Probably, I want to say it was, I think it was this summer, maybe?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I don't know if they had a date yet on that.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
But yes, all the original voice actors are supposed to be coming back,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
including, I guess, the guy, the Scrooge, who's in his 90s.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Wow.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
No, no.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
He's in his 70s. Somebody else on the cast.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
The Magic of Dispel voice actress is 90.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Oh, okay.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
But she's been doing voices for Disney for years.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Right, exactly.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
No, I think the guy-

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Wasn't she also a Granny Gummy?

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
She might have been.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
The guy who does Uncle Scrooge was also Mr. Ed way back in the day.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Wow.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Remember that show?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Yeah.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
We weren't even alive when that show was on.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
But we had Nick at Night.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
Yeah, they used to rerun the shit out of it on Nickelodeon when we were younger,

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
so that's how I remember it.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
I freaking loved Mr. Ed.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
I'm just, it's really surprising that they are redoing this.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
I'm surprised they would even do that.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
I think it's great.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
But seriously, when you're watching that trailer for the first time,

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
and SSJ100Matt, who is at the show, is saying in chat room,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
PAX East blew up when I was there.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I can only imagine.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
And how epic was that trailer?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Did you see the trailer they put out for it,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
where it has those quotes that are like,

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
this is the series that defined a generation,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
and all these inspirational quotes.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
And then it says, come on everybody, sing along.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Did you see this Dark Sakura?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Oh.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
No, I didn't.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Well then, now I have an excuse to play it.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Stop asking me for quotes, Tim Schafer.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
You had an excuse already, Rob.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
I'm going to give you the clip notes version, though, here, okay?

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
So, like, here's Capcom, and like the inspirational music,

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
and the few games are so rich with such a wealth of, right?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
So it's like setting up for it.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
And then, okay, so after all that.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
Ready, sing along.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
I like that it has the bopping head.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
But look how it looks.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I mean, it looks awesome.

30:48.000 --> 30:56.000
Yeah.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
How can I cut this off early?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
Like, I have to let it play.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
The only thing I'm disappointed is they didn't show the moon.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Well, they got to keep something a secret.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
They got to save something.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
It looks like there was only Transylvania in there and one other stage.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Well, it also can't be complete.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Yeah, it's probably not done yet.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
I didn't watch gameplay.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Apparently, they retweeted all the bosses, so they're harder now.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Nice.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
Like, they have more sequences to them.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
You have to remember, as awesome as the game as DuckTales was,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
it really was only like six stages.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
It was about as long as the first Mega Man game, right?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Yeah.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
It wasn't a whole lot to it, so I don't know if they're like adding or whatever.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
But seriously, when I just heard, I was like, oh, WayForward and Capcom?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Who brokered that deal?

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
Because that is like inspired genius for real.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
Because WayForward did a great job with the Double Dragon Neon,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
and they did some of these other remakes too.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
They did the Contra game on DS.

31:48.000 --> 31:55.000
They've done a lot of good stuff, and to trust them with DuckTales was genius.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
So when I saw the trailer, I was just like, yes.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
Didn't we all kind of go like, Capcom has made a lot of bad decisions in the past year,

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
and this is the first time where you're like, oh my god, I can like them again.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Like, we're sorry. Please love us.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
It's cool to like Capcom again.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Here you go. Here's something you want to see.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Have WayForward redo Link to the Past.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Ah!

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Or, let's just see if we can take that further.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Have them redo Super Metroid.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
Go into some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

32:27.000 --> 32:33.000
Gamergirl says, LOL, I'm still laughing because I had the lyrics wrong for so long.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
The trailer did kind of make a lot of you guys realize that, huh?

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Yeah, but Dan regularly breaks into that theme song at my house,

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
so I have no excuse not to know that and the Darkwing Duck theme.

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
Extover says, I admit that I didn't play much of the original NES game since we only rented it once,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
but I'm amused and excited by the remaster.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
I didn't own it either, and I'm in the same boat.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
We rented it like three times. I mean, you used to rent it all the time.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
I think I did own the game. I want to say I did own that.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
But that's what makes me more, because now that I'm an adult and I can buy whatever the hell I want,

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
I'm going to own this. It's going to be great.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Let's see.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
I should actually text Dan and see if he knows about it.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Dark Tetsuya says, There's your list list.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Series WayForward needs to update for 2013.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
That's a great idea, Dark Tetsuya. We're going to do that.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Maybe not tonight, but soon.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Let's see.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Act F says, The moon is going to sound so fucking awesome.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Technus says, $15, huh?

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
Yeah, it took five seconds for it to make me want to buy it.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Ditto. Ditto.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
But here's the bottom line, as excited as we all are,

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
please don't fuck this up.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
Like, this is sacred territory, people, right?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Please don't fuck this up.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Just say it.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Stop raping your childhood.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
All right. Was that it on the start? Wasn't there another?

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Yeah, that was it.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Did we talk about the other series?

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
The possibility that they said they were going to do

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Rescue Rangers, possibly, and some of this other stuff?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Oh, God, that'd be awesome.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Yeah, no, it's in one of the other, I think it's in the second link.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
They said that if this does well,

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
that there is the potential that they'll do, like,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
Rescue Rangers and some of the other Capcom Disney stuff.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
And I'm sitting there going, Mickey Mascarpane, Mickey Mascarpane.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Which is kind of basic, but I loved it.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
You know what?

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
I literally tripped over that cartridge the other day.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
Because Midna has been trying to get up on the shelves

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
to get to stuff, and she knocked it down.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
It was in the case and everything.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Now, would this mean that maybe we'd start getting into

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
some of the later games, like Aladdin?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Yeah, that was one of the other things they said.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
They said, Chippendale Rescue Rangers, Darkwing Duck, and Aladdin.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Darkwing Duck, I would be happy about.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
SSJ-100 Matt says, from what I saw at the show,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
they didn't mess it up.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Thank heavens.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Thank heavens.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Yeah, it looked good from what I saw.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
They had the boss fight against, uh...

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Who was it? Magica the Spell.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
It was pretty awesome.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
So excited.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Here's the other thing I wanted to say about this.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
They need to make sweet, sweet Disney love.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
I know we've got a Mega Man thing coming up later on,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
but I have to bring this up.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Like, why not just let WayForward do Mega Man?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Dark Soccer.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
That made me spaz so hard, I dropped my mic.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Like...

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
I know, right?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Why not just let them do Mega Man?

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Because they'll probably do the game we all want, right?

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
So hopefully this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
We'll see.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
Actually, you know who should really be doing the next Mega Man,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
if they did one,

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
would be letting the people who did the Street Fighter

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
cross Mega Man.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Oh, the...

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
I know what you're talking about.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
The anniversary of the freebie that was on the internet.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Yeah.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Maybe, maybe.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
One of the other big games that came out of PAX East

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
was somewhat of a surprise announcement from Blizzard.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
You know, I have the other show, Hoard House,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
where we talk a lot about World of Warcraft and things,

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
and there were a lot of people thinking

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
that it was going to be, like, a big thing.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Like, it was going to be another expansion

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
or that it was Titan,

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
even though Blizzard said time and time again it's not Titan.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Well, it kind of did come out of left field.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
This is not something people were predicting.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
The game that Blizzard announced at PAX East

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
was called Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
It's a card game, basically.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
It's a virtual card game.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
It's going to be playable on PC, Mac, and iPad.

36:27.000 --> 36:32.000
Kind of think very similar to that Magic the Gathering game

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
they have on, you know, Xbox and PlayStation and iPad.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
But in fact, they even say,

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
hey, this is inspired partially out of our love of,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
you know, Magic the Gathering and these other games.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
But I'm getting the feeling this is going to be really simplified,

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
and obviously has Warcraft lore really woven into it.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Don't they have a card game already?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Blizzard?

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Yeah.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
They have a tangible, wow, trading card game.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
That's what I meant.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
But this isn't that.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I think it's a simpler version of that,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
and it's not meant to be a tangible game.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
It is a little weird because both of those exist,

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
but I think there's room for both.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
I mean, if Magic the Gathering can be successful

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
in both a tangible game and an online game,

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
I don't see why Blizzard can't have two properties out there.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Now, here's the thing.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
It is going to be a free game, but it's freemium.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
You earn more cards.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
You can earn them through playing the game,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
and you win medals when you do PVP against people.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
But you will also be able to buy expansion packs,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
of course, with real money.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
They're thinking about one dollar.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
That's what they're thinking right now for the packs.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
Hearthstone will have 300 cards in the initial collection,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
and it's hero versus hero.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
You play as one of the nine Central Warcraft classes,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
each represented by a hero.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Thrall!

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
You can play, I believe Thrall is the shaman.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I know Anduin is the priest.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Malfurion, I think, is the druid.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
You can play as one of the big characters,

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
and it looks really good.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Dark Saga, did you see this at all?

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
I think this is their trailer that talks about,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
actually, let me see if I can find the match.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
So that Jaina would be mage.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
If you buy me a little time here, I'll try to find the...

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Well, I'm broke, so I can't buy you anything.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
But, well, I'm trying to think over who...

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
Here it is. Here's the gameplay video where it's...

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
I'm going to go kind of midway into this here.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
Let me make this a little bigger so you can actually see it here.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Your turn.

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
You'll notice it's very cartoony and animated in the way it looks.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Oh, you've got little panda houses.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
Yeah, it definitely has some of the newer...

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
Even though we only see old Warcraft characters in this,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
it definitely has some of the newer inspired stuff.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
I quit playing Magic for a reason.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Yeah, you don't think you'd be into this?

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
There was a time sink.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
Now, Loki, I could see them wanting people like you

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
who don't touch any Blizzard IPs as of right now.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Someone like you would be great to get into this game.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Any interest in this for you?

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Nope.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Why not?

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
I just don't care. I really don't care.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
But you're not a big card game person.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
No, I'm not.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Makes sense.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Well, I'll give it a try.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Some reason it reminds me of, like, Pagle.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I mean, the screen looks like Pagle.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Is it going to be free? Why not?

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Yeah, that's where I'm at.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
That's how they get you hooked.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
There was a lot of people on Twitter that were like,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
this is going to be stupid.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
Well, at least they don't charge you to play it like Tetra Master.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
That's where my mind went, too,

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
is I was like, oh, remember when Tetra Master was in Final Fantasy XI?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
He had to pay like a dollar a month to play it.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
God, I never touched that.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I did my 30-day free trial of Tetra Master,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
and I think I maybe paid for one more month.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
It was fun.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
I didn't bother.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
But it was like ten years ago, you know?

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
And, I mean, technology's come a long way.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
I hated it.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
I'll try this.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Yeah, I'll try this. Why not?

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
I download it. If it sucks, delete it.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
It can't be worse than Yaris.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
That's right. It already looks better than Yaris.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Ain't that the truth?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
And then if I keep selling stuff in Diablo,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I can buy the expansion packs,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
although that's exactly what Blizzard wants.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
And I bet we're going to see more of this,

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
especially when the Titan thing is revealed, the MMO.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
I bet there's going to be a lot of mini-

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
I bet there'll be real money woven into that somehow

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
in its own little economy,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
where Blizzard gets a little chunk of it every time.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
It's an extremely profitable avenue for them.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
So, uh, yeah.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Let's move on with more news.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
By the way, we will have-

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Well, it's not a surprise to you anymore,

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
because I told you what it is.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
We will have something special for the fifth-

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
for our, um, fifth, uh, centiversary.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
I guess that's how it would be for hundreds.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Um, so here's glorious, beautiful news.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Rob, we need to have Ding Dong the Witch's Dead

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
playing in the background.

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
Um, but the, uh, CEO of EA, John Riccitello,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
is that how you pronounce his name?

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
Is stepping down on the 30th.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Yay, because he has butchered some of our favorite stuff.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
Um, basically the whole reason he's stepping down too

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
is because of fiscal, um, uh, depreciation in the company.

41:13.000 --> 41:20.000
Um, yeah, and like, he's basically saying that it has to do,

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
and I'm going to read you the quote,

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
My decision to leave EA is really all about my accountability

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
for the shortcomings in our, uh, financial results this year.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
It looks like we will likely come in at the low end

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
or slightly below the financial guidance we issued to the street.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
So, yeah, and you know what?

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
I- you should have seen the wank on Twi- on a- on a Tumblr

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
when this- in the Mass Effect fan community.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
It was glorious and beautiful,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
and there were lots of dancing gifs.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Yep.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Oh my God, those clothes.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Is it really- is it really going to change anything?

42:08.000 --> 42:14.000
Well, the people next in line, let's see, we have, um,

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
right now the interim leader is going to be Larry Probst,

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
who was the, uh, CEO from 1991 to 2007,

42:21.000 --> 42:27.000
and likely candidates to replace, uh, is, uh, Frank Gibbo,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
who is the president of EA Labels,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
or their, um, COO Peter Moore,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
who was, uh, once in charge of EA Sports

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
and worked for Microsoft during the Xbox 360 launch.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Ah, I could see Peter Moore, yeah, yeah.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Uh, let's see, Xtopher in chat says,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
At least he took responsibility.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Uh, yeah, I mean, at least he was-

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
it- it wasn't as good as the Groupon guy's goodbye letter.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
I don't know if you guys saw that a few weeks ago,

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
but that was good.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
You know- you know shit's bad if Valve says no.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
Uh, let's see, um, bonds006,

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
I have to agree with this comment in our chatroom,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
live.vognetwork.com, uh,

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
Someone will take John's place and EA will be EA.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
And I don't think this is really going to change it.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I think he's just the fall guy for, you know,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
all this bam, bam, bam.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
Star Wars Old Republic didn't do as well as it was supposed to.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
Mass Effect 3's ending just, you know,

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
as much as I hate the link behind that.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Well, yeah, but you know- you know the-

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
the whole big rush on that, the pressure came from EA.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
True, okay, true, good point.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Uh, and now SimCity, you know,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
and all that, they had to give free games away.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
He's just, uh, head of the Hydra.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
On top of that, though, this is coming out right before, um,

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
well, right after they found out that they're gonna be next, um,

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
again on the top ten list of worst companies to work for.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
So...

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
Not to mention that they are also in the running for,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
and at least I haven't seen the voting, though, for it yet,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
so I'm not sure if they've made it through the first round.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
They're also on the, uh, list for worst company in America.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I- who cares?

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
I mean, isn't that all just a-

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
Yes, it's a popularity contest, or unpopularity contest.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
It's an internet trolling contest.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
It's the reverse of a popularity contest.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
At any rate, I- I would like to be hopeful

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
to see better things come out, to see a new direction,

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
you know, to see them stop snatching up companies left and right

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
and ruining their, uh-

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
fixed goddamn origin.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
I sat there for thirty- thirty minutes last night.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Myself, Alan, Shane, and Tim all wanted to play multiplayer, right?

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
So we're trying to play multiplayer Mass Effect,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
but because Alan and I are in the same house,

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
we keep running into these problems where two of us can connect,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
but then the others can't get in, it keeps timing out,

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
literally takes us thirty minutes to figure out,

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
we gotta crack the code.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Okay, here's how we form the game.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I'll host the game, then Alan, you join.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
Now, Rob is gonna invite Tim, Alan will invite Shane,

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
and then it'll work.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
That's what it took, honestly.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
We had to mix and match the order of who joined when,

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
just to play stinkin' Mass Effect multiplayer.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Yeah.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Fix origin.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Do you want us to take it seriously?

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
More like butt-gin.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Oh.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
But- but I'm- I'm still gonna-

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
I mean, honestly, I think that origin, in and of itself,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
is a bad business decision to go through, but I mean,

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
it's like I was saying before, you know shit's bad when Valve refuses your money.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Well, but- but here's the thing, speaking of all that,

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
we have to remember Steam was pretty bad when it first launched,

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
everybody was pissed because it was bundled with Half-Life 2 and you had no choice,

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
there's a lot of that, so like, I wanna be hopeful and say,

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
maybe there's a light at the end of the tunnel and maybe this'll all turn out okay,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
but I'm just- I just-

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
They keep fucking it up.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
I just don't have that same level of trust in EA right now.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
They keep fucking it up. End of the story.

45:35.000 --> 45:44.000
And I mean, I love the entire Mass Effect series, even if there are-

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
I like- I like to joke around and call 3 a sparkly turd.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
And there's lots of stuff in 3 that I love, I love the gameplay,

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
I love scenes, I love parts of the story.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
It's just the whole lack of- what's the word I'm thinking of?

46:02.000 --> 46:10.000
Continuity, really going from game to game, changing writing staff,

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
and you know that that pressure came from EA.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Dungeon Buster in our chat room, kind of with another perspective,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
like what about the good things Rickatello did?

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
Dungeon Buster says the board probably forced him out,

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
EA stock has been on a brutal decline in the last few years,

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
I don't disagree with that for sure.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
Dungeon Buster says Rickatello was also known for taking gambles

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
backing Dante's Inferno, Mirror's Edge, et cetera.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
I mean, for better or for worse, those were some original games.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
You know, I would say for better, Mirror's Edge, for worse.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Don't think that.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
But for better or worse, got to work.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
That's like asking what did Bush do good for the country?

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Oh, I knew you'd take it down a political route.

46:53.000 --> 47:00.000
No, but seriously, I think I remembered reading on one other article

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
that their stock increased after the announcement.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
Just saying.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
Let's see, Raginator in chat at live.vognetwork.com says

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
which is worse to work for?

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
EA, Gamestop, or Emperor Palpatine?

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Which would be the worst to work for?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I'd probably say...

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Mmm, that's really tough.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
That was really tough.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
I mean, at least with Palpatine, like,

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
you don't have to worry about being unemployed

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
because you'd just be dead.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
Well, and as long as you're on the Death Star that they don't blow up,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
you might have it pretty good.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Yeah, they fucked up every Death Star.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I don't know. EA's going to hire me at corporate or game,

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
so I was going to hire me at corporate.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Now, if you're working a death job on Coruscant, you're usually fine.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
Just saying.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
I'm not saying that, you know, they're that bad to work for.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
But...

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
use the passphrase, draw.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
All right, let's move on with more news

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
because, Loki, I think you have something very related to this, right?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I mean, I know we're talking about, you know, Origin,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
but what could they possibly fix with Origin?

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
I mean, Origin's perfect, right?

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Uh...

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, what's this?

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
Origin has an exploit where you can use hyperlinks to run malicious code?

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
No, that's not good.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Yes, apparently there is a way that, um...

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
What do you mean, run Origin?

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
No, it's not just running Origin, it's Origin Plus.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Uh, it's...

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
They have this stew...

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
And I don't even know why you would need this in the first place,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
why this is even part of a feature or something,

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
but they have these URI hyperlinks

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
that basically you click on a link on a webpage or something like that,

48:34.000 --> 48:40.000
it launches Origin and whatever game, you know, that it's specifying.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
But on top of that, not only can you do that,

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
but you can also have these hyperlinks

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
and then have this, like, you know, command parameters and stuff.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
So you can actually have, basically, you change the hyperlink

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
instead of saying, you know, Origin, launch game, blah, blah, blah.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
It'll be Origin, launch game, blah, blah.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
With this command parameter, I want you to open this, you know,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
DLL at this IP address.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Well, that's not good.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
And you're opening, you know, some sort of malicious file

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
on a remotely controlled server.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Because that's a thing that they have in there.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
And I love their comment on it, though.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Our team is constantly investigating hypotheticals like this one

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
as we continually update our security infrastructure,

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
considering investigating or constantly investigating.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
But I don't see a patch for this right now.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
I mean, they know about it.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Just to say...

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
It's being worked on soon, trademark.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
The best thing you can do is if you have like a web browser

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
or something like that,

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
if you haven't yet clicked on one of these URI links

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
or something like that,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
one, you know, you get a prompt in like Firefox

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
or something like that that says, you know,

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
use this program to launch this type of file going forward.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
Just have it say, you know, let me choose.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
I mean, how often are you really going to be launching

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
URI links through your web browser?

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Probably not very.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
And then, of course, you know,

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
where they say they're constantly investigating stuff.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
I got a wonder, though, is it...

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
Something very similar now with the Play for Free

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
or Battlefield Play for Free.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Very similar with that is they have another thing.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
It's an exploit for older versions of Windows,

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
anything before Vista,

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
where someone can launch a mod file.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
I guess it's used to customize games and settings.

50:32.000 --> 50:37.000
And that mod file could queue also some malicious code

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
somewhere else.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
So very similar, but with a whole different game,

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
not necessarily Origin, but that's not good.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
And I guess they say that it's successful

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
because it overwrites a whitelist

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
that's supposed to restrict sites

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
because of this mod file or like a batch file

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
or something like that.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
Yeah, they upload a malicious batch file.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
They'll execute the next time the computer is restarted.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
I don't know.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
Fun!

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
That's kind of lame.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
I mean, I'll keep your Windows updated, I guess,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
but not everyone's going to be buying

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Vista.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
But there are people out there with Windows XP still.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Who has it better, the people with Windows XP

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
or the people with Windows 8?

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I'm just trolling.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Windows 8 apparently isn't that bad, really.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I'm glad I don't have it.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
I had to use it on my wife's sister's laptop

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
to try to like...

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I don't like how everything's arranged in there.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
It's very odd.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
But I mean, I'm sure it's a little bit of a learning curve.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
But yeah, the regular desktop's there.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
It's just... it's odd.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
I don't know. That's the best way I could describe it.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
Well, I know you play Origin every day, Loki,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
so you have a lot to be worried about with this.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
No, I have not installed Origin at all.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
I know I probably have somewhere like an EA account

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
because I did for Burnout Paradise.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I think it's Paradise.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
But I have yet to...

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
You know whose fault it is I have Origin on PC, right?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Shane's. Totally Shane's fault.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Yeah, Shane.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Didn't you play Burnout Paradise way back in the day?

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Way back in the day, too, though.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Didn't you play Burnout Paradise way back in the day?

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Yeah, but that was not my PC. It was on Xbox.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
With oodles and oodles of love,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
thank you for introducing me to the series.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Alright, I probably would have had to do it eventually

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
because Alan's a big PC.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
He doesn't really play stuff on consoles anymore.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
But anyway, let's talk about better news

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
and things that put a smile on your face

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
as opposed to angry little, you know,

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
slanted eyebrows that indicate an angry face.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I have a sound for that face.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Yes, face.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
This is actually really exciting news.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
I was very happy to hear this.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
The Final Fantasy X HD remaster on PlayStation 3,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
it's going to include Final Fantasy X-2,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
which I think is great.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
That is as reported in Jump Magazine.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Both games based on the International Edition,

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
and yes, apparently both are getting that HD remaster treatment.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
Because they're both the same engine.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
The first trailer for Final Fantasy X just hit,

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
I think today, so you can actually check that out.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
It looks nice.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I will definitely be picking this up.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
I love that both these games are on one disc for PlayStation 3.

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
Now the Vita, the Vita will be getting both these games,

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
but they have to be purchased separately.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
However, the games are supposed to come out this year,

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
which is pretty exciting.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
That'll be fun.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
And yet another reason to not get a PlayStation 4,

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
where there's all this good stuff still coming out on PlayStation 3.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Maybe I'll actually beat one of them.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
You know what my problem was?

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I breezed all the way through both of them

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
and still wasn't high enough level.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
I didn't really play.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
I mean, I watched you, I think, play some of X-2,

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
and I've certainly seen my fair share of YouTubes.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
I didn't really play a lot of X-2.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
So I'm kind of, I'd like to give it a fair shot.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
Well, I mean, if you had let me know this,

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
I would have just loaned you my copy.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
Yeah.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Well, I've also got X International.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
So.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
ActDeftInChat says,

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Final Fantasy X sucks though.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Wrong.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Incorrect.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
I see where people take issue to it.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
I do get the issues with it.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
What can I do for you?

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
But as the game itself, I really like it.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
That's where every gamer has a voice

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
and everybody gets their own opinion,

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
even when they're wrong.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
DarkSakura.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Even when they're being a butt.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
No, I didn't mean that.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
Only minorly.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
So here's some good news,

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
and I actually have to thank CatastrophicMaggie

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
for sharing some nice stuff with me.

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
The European Wii U eShop lifted the age restriction

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
that they were having, you know,

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
where you can only buy the games after like,

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
what, nine o'clock?

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Yeah, it was.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Yeah, you can only buy them after.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Oh, after eleven.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
On the Wii U eShop.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
All night.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
What was her name?

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Rhonda Shear.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I still remember that show.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Rhonda Shear.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Oh my God.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
You know what?

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
She was hilarious.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
So I've watched every single Toxic Avenger movie

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
thanks to Rhonda Shear.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Just saying.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
But yeah, it had to do with German law.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
Hold on, hold on.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
This is very important.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
Hi, it's Rhonda, and we'll be watching

55:26.000 --> 55:32.000
Hats and Surf Nazis Must Die next on USA Up All Night.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Yeah, it wasn't because of the voice that I remembered that.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
The 80s hair and the...

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
No, it wasn't the hair.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
It was not the hair.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
Even I have to look at that and go, damn.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
What's she doing now?

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Now I'm gonna have to Wikipedia.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Oh, great, Rob.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Thank you.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Car shows, I'm sure.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
Rhonda Shear.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
Anyway, so yeah, I think it's really hilarious

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
that we're talking about her and Germany.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Oh, she died.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
Did she?

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
No, I just made that up.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
Fuck you.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Okay.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
And you said I couldn't troll people.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
She's had some surgery too.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Let's see, her last film that she did in 2003,

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
Prison A Go-Go.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
Fun.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
But let's see, she's been doing Sheer Intimates LLC.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
So she's doing panties basically.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
In 2010, Rhonda designed the Abra.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Isn't that a Pokemon?

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
Makes sense, yeah.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
Isn't that a Pokemon?

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
What does the Abra do?

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
And the product was an overnight success.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
The Abra is the number one selling bra worldwide.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
That reads like a sales pitch.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
She plans to add cosmetic swimwear fragrance

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
and boomer hottie into, I think that's,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
somebody just edited that fucking article.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I want to know what the Abra is now.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Charity work, since we're giving her a hard time.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
In 2011, Rhonda was the event chair and a sponsor

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
for American Cancer Society's Making Strides

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Put On Your Pink Bra event.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
If I remember correctly from my infomercials,

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
the Abra is a bra that you don't see the bra lines.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Uh, I just went to look it up.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
Loki?

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Oh, dude, this is things that they sell at the

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
seen on TV store.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
You guys, Loki knows what an Abra is.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I watch TV, okay?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Yes, infomercials.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I also know what a slap chop is.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
What is a slap chop?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
A slap chop is a thing that you can chop garlic in.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
I own one.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
And I had the knockoff brand, it sucked.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Because the garlic is stuck up in the goddamn thing.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
USA chop all night.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Yes.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
Um, so, can I go back to the story that I was trying

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
so professionally to discuss?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
No, because I'm reading a comment from Marissa

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Marissa, do you have an Abra?

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
Uh, Marissa says,

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
Abra is a lazy, saggy bra for wusses.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Yes, according to their website-

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Well, then again, she has utas brasiers.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
According to their website, it says,

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
Say goodbye to pinching, binding, chafing, and discomfort.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
Prevents bra bulge and underarm cleavage.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
Fits perfectly even if you gain or lose weight.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
It's a chest girdle.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
And it's machine washable.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Can I get an aw-

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
You know what?

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
Can I get an aw brief?

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
You know what, first of all?

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
What?

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I have a comfortable bra.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
Just saying.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
And I can wash it in the washing machine!

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
It looks like a tank top made out of spandex

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
or something like that.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
It's like, bulgy boob cups.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Alright, back to the stuff, video games.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
It's a boob girdle.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
What gamers really want to know.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
Boobs.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
I don't know, look at our demographic.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
Anyway.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Um, so yeah.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Basically they made some, uh,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
I guess they had to have discussed something

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
with the German government

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
or found some loophole to get out of it.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
But now you can, uh,

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
you can shop for games before 11.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
Now I imagine she's talking about the aw bra.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
They had to make a deal with the German government

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
in order to be able to sell it.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
First of all, they had to strike a deal with David Hasselhoff.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
Because he secretly uses the aw bra for his man boobs.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Awesome.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
I'm done.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
I'm leaving the room done.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
Bye.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
God.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Alright, uh,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
let's travel around the world and check-

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
But we need to get Marissa to call in

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
and do Utz's brassieres now.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
Well, we also have the PAX East calls tonight.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I have to keep it on topic a little bit,

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
but Marissa's more than welcome to come to episode 500.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Anyway, uh, release dates.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Let's travel around the world

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
and check out what is coming out in a lingerie store near you.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Loki.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Uh, today, uh, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Gates to Infinity, and 3DS,

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
and I believe today was also...

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
Luigi's Mansion.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Yeah, it's Luigi's Mansion.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I can't remember if that was earlier than today or today.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Anyways, so there was that.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
And then, of course, next week, also some big stuff.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
Bioshock Infinite on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Of course, um, Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000
WRC-FIA World Rally Championship 2012 on PlayStation 3.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Uh, Final Fantasy XI,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
The Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition on Xbox 360

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
on PC and 360.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Final Fantasy XI, Seekers of Alduin.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Um, Tiger Woods, PGA Tour 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Also, the Master's Historic Edition

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
if you really want to spend extra money for a few extra courses.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And...

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I believe that's it.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Let's go to Japan and check out the release dates over there.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
On the PlayStation 3 on March 28th,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel comes out on PlayStation 3,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
as well as Sengoku Basara Triple Pack.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I am assuming that is all three games in the, uh,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
it's Sengoku Basara 3, Utage, and HD Collection

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
are all the games that are that.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Uh, what series is this? Is this...

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
That would be Three Kingdoms, Sengoku...

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Sengoku Basara is Devil Kings over here.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Thank you. I was like, I know it's over here, but it's...

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's the Capcom Fantasy Warriors game.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
It's a little more, like, cultish over here, I guess, for lack of a better term.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
They don't release any over here, that's why.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I thought, no, they have Devil Kings.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
They had Devil Kings on PlayStation 2,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
and then they had Sengoku Basara on the Wii,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
and PlayStation 3, like, a couple years ago.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Uh, the Final Fantasy XI expansion makes its way to Japan as well,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
and the Xbox 360, for all you guys playing it on the 360 in Japan.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Uh, as well as Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Cave Shooting Collection, that ought to be pretty good,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
and Love Torre Chocolate.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And the Cave Shooting Collection, by the way,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
since it is a Cave title, I believe those are region-free.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Nice.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
What, is that something that might come to the store, then?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Um, I'm sure that...

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Some of them hit the, uh, direct download.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Well, Cave, the Shooting Collection,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I mean, all the Cave titles have been out on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Okay.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I want to say that it's, um...

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Probably...

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
They probably will bring it over here.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Axis Games might bring it over.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Axis or... Yeah.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Yeah, it would be Axis Games, I think. They would be the ones.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
By the way, I looked up Basara.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
It means crazy or over-the-top, but also stylish.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Better than Basura in Spanish.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
What does that mean? Junk? Trash?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Trash, yeah.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Alright, uh, PlayStation Vita this week in Japan.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
On the 28th, Oboro Muramasa comes out this week from Marvelous Entertainment.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It has to do with a sword.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Muramasa Rebirth, the remake.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Seimadu Monogatari comes out as well from Compile.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Compile! Yay!

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Who needs to remake the Guardian Legend somehow.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Cotton!

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Alright.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
And Guardian Legend.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Yes.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Lastly, but not leastly, on the 3DS this week,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Nano Assault gets a price reduction,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and Shoshinsha Kata Nai Honnichi Made Soroban Anzan Flash Anzan.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
That's a mouthful. What game is this?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Duff.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
No pictures of it, but the related games are all, like...

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Puppies.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Puppies and Kitty Cafe and things like that,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
so it's one of those games.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Alright, how about the UK? Dark Sakura?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Some stuff.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000
In the UK, we have, starting with the 26th, we have Bioshock Infinite.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
On the 27th, Lego City Undercover and Sly Cooper Thieves in Time.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
The 28th, we have Luigi's Mansion 2 and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And on the 29th, we have Army of Four.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
That's it.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
There you go. Just a couple more news stories for you guys,

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and then the classic game of the week.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
But first, Loki.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Now, even though War Z may try to convince you that they were part of this program,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
they actually don't have this program out yet, or they just started it.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
It's the early access program.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000
It allows you to play and purchase games that are still in development.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
They have a few games, starting off with Arma 3 and Star Forge.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Also, a game I think should be at least a nominee for the best title of a game in 2013,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Drunken Robot Pornography.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Sign me up.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I mean, that sounds awesome.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Yes, and then, let's see, was it Kenshi?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Kenshi, an open-ended squad-based strategy RPG.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
That's too big of a subtitle.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I'm sorry.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
You're going to have to change that.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Basically, so, yeah.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
They're going to add features, and stuff will be available over time.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Plus, I guess you'll be able to maybe provide some feedback for the titles.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
But that's kind of cool that you can do that.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Arma 3, I actually kind of want to try that, but Arma's so simulation

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
that I just would want to mod the hell out of it, you know,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
get laser beams and stuff.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
That'd be ridiculous.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I kind of like that whole idea about getting in early on the game's development

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
and kind of getting to give that instant feedback,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
and maybe your angry internet comments really can influence the game.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yeah.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Kind of neat.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Especially in this Kickstarter world we live in now,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
this seems like a great place to launch a project that started on Kickstarter

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
where your investors, essentially, really can have their say on the game's development.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
There is one I saw.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
It wasn't Kickstarter.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
It was another.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I don't know if they were doing it through their own website.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
No.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
It was, actually, it was a train simulation game.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
But the difference was is they were asking people to crowdfund it,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
but the people that crowdfunded it also get a portion of the profits

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
that they receive from the game.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
So you're profit sharing, I guess, which is kind of cool.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
That'd be kind of neat to do with Kickstarter.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Hmm.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I might have missed it.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Are there any games you're looking forward to being a part of with this?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
No.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Not right now.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I mean, Arma 3 looks kind of cool.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I may have to check out robot, you know, the robot pornography game

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
because that's an awesome title, and I like giant robot games,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
so it'd be interesting to check out.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
It'd be interesting to check out.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
All right.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Well, one more story for you guys, and I alluded to this earlier

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
when we were talking about DuckTales,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
but there was some talk about Mega Man at PAX East

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
at the World of Capcom panel.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Brett Elston, the Capcom community manager,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
said that Capcom is developing a new game in the Mega Man series,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
but they're not ready to fully announce it just yet.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I think this is kind of a duh.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I mean, despite the canceled projects,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I mean, like, would you really just drop something like Mega Man?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
No, I think you put it to bed for a few years,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
and then it comes back better than ever, right?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
That's probably what's happening here.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
However, since this story first broke on the internet,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Capcom kind of came behind the community manager here and said,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
now, now, now, now, no Mega Man game has been confirmed.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
The company is having ongoing discussions about Mega Man,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
but it won't announce anything until something is ready.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
So don't hold your breath that that's necessarily this year.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
It could be a long time.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Now, Shane was sending me some private messages

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
when we were talking about the whole DuckTales and WayForward thing

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
and saying, what else should WayForward do?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And Shane was reminding me, Rob, WayForward doesn't always strike gold.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Let's pull up WayForward's resume

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
and see some of the other games that they've done in the past.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Godzilla Domination on the Game Boy Advance,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
SpongeBob SquarePants Lights Camera Pants,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
the A Boy and His Blob on the Wii,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
although, to be fair, I never really gave that a try,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
so I don't know how.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I really wanted to play that too because I love the first one.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Let's see, the Silent Hill Book of Memories game on the Vita,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
but see, Shane didn't like that.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I didn't think it was terrible.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I just didn't think it was great, but it's decent.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
It wasn't very Silent Hilly, was it?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
But here, here's the biggest sin WayForward has ever committed.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
You ready for this?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
A Nintendo DS game called Ping Pals.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Oh.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Do you remember this game?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Yes.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I didn't play it, but I remember.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
It was like somebody put out PictoChat as a game.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But how long ago was that?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
2004, glad you asked.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I mean, think about it.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
They've done their time.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
They did their time in jail.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
They've learned their lesson.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
They made some bad mistakes as kids, and now they're adults.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Do I have Queen's We Are the Champions going through my head?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Okay, let's look at their more recent resume.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
So there's Silent Hill Book of Memories, the Adventure Time game,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Hey Ice King, Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Yeah, that was fantastic.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Mighty Switch Force Hyperdrive Edition, which was actually pretty good.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Double Dragon Neon, which was great.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Blood Rain Betrayal.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Considering the source material, yeah.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And Shantae, I keep wanting to say Shantae.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Shantae, you stay.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Shantae, Risky's Revenge.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
That's supposed to be pretty good.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Okay, so they made a few mistakes as kids.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I did want to mention, because I do happen to follow them on Facebook,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
the 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:20.000
They did post a wonderful update regarding a fan-made game in the Mega Man series.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It's called The Master System.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
It's an action brawler game based in the Mega Man Legends series.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
They have two unique characters, and you fight a bunch of the Reaverbots.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And you can check it out for free right now.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It's arcade.legends-station.com?sp equals Master System.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
So check it out, or follow the 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
which they are now 101,000 strong.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Just saying.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
101,000.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Tigerclaw in chat linking us to some Ping Pals gameplay.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Check that out.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Where you have an actual little keyboard you can type on, or you can draw,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
and you have coins to buy stuff for your avatar.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
But here's the thing with Ping Pals, man.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Can you imagine? Remember there was that Boyfriend Simulator game

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
that had the really fucked up chatbot engine that was in there?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
It will say some weird shit to you.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
If they re-released that game with that in there, that could actually be entertaining.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Here's the thing about Ping Pals.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Just trying to cut this game a little slack.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
What if, when this game started development,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
they didn't know that Nintendo was going to put PictoChat into the system?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
What if there had been no PictoChat?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Would we be giving Ping Pals such shit?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I think we might still be a little bit less.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
A little bit less.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
But a little bit less, yeah.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I don't think we'd remember it quite as horrifically as we do, because...

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
It wouldn't seem as ridiculous.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Yeah.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Alright, well, let's go back to a much simpler time.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Let's go back before WayForward and all this stuff, before even Ping Pals.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
We're going to go back to a much simpler time in a segment we call

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
The Classic Game of the Week,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
where Dark Soccer is going to walk into the gaming vault

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and find a game that she thinks,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Hey, you kids and your frickin' HD reboots.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
In this case it's, Hey, I can't believe I haven't done this one yet.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Go play this pixelated classic and love it.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Eternal Champions.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
How have I never done this?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
You say that every week. How have I never done this?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I was sitting down trying to go through all of the...

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Oh, fuck.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I hate...

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Do your... Read your thing.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Anyway, so anyway, Eternal Champions came out in 1993.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:48.000
It was a 2D fighting game, and they came out for the Mega Drive or Sega Genesis that same year.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
And it was sort of like a Mortal Kombat-y type of thing,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000
where there were over-kills and special moves and things.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
But it did spawn like one of the best sequels ever,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
which was Eternal Champions Challenge for the Dark Side,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
which was basically the Sega CD version.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And two other spin-offs, there was a...

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
It's just set in that universe,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
and it's also out on the Wii Virtual Console account in 2007.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
So basically, it's just this typical fighting game.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I mean, it works a lot like Street Fighter II.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.000
It uses the six-button controller, though, so that you can have the different ones.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
And the version of this that I have, I got with Sega Activator.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Do you remember the Activator?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Oh, he had one of those Activators.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
He was trying to build a Para Para machine out of it.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Yeah, I think I threw it away.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I'm gonna tell you how we got our Activator.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Right before Virgin went out of business, we bought it for eight bucks.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
A Genesis Activator.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
So that's how we have our copy.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
When was that long ago when Virgin Megastore went out of business?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It was very soon after I moved out here.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Wow, okay.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Longer than ten years ago.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I guess you're right. It seems like that wasn't that long ago.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Of course I'm right. It's me.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
So basically, you block by holding away.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Like I said, very Street Fighter, you don't have an actual block button.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
But if you get hit several times in a row, you get dizzy, and then your opponent gets a free attack.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Blah, blah, blah. The usual stuff.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:26.000
You also had a special attack meter, so that you could do different specials.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
And then you had your overkills.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And that was stage specific.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I'm getting tongue tied today.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.000
These are basically, you have to defeat your opponent where they fall in a certain area of the ground.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
If they land in the right spot, the life bars disappear.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
And something in the background kills them to death.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Like for example...

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Wow, this person just got set on fire.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Yeah.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Awesome.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
If you're, you can get vaporized by neon sign and shadows level.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
A Tyrannosaurus can kill you and slash a level.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Good lord, that goes on forever.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Not only did the guy get set on fire, but then you see a skeleton, and then the head falls off the skeleton.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Like...

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Yeah.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Ew.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
There's a drive by shooting in Larsen's level.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And a napalm bomb in Midnight's level.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:23.000
So yeah, there were a bunch of characters, and I'm gonna go through the character list real quick.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Just because some of them had some fun names.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
And there were some of the, I thought some of the better characters were in the second one.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.000
But you had Shadow Miyamoto, Rax Coswell, Jonathan Blade, Jetta Max.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Slash Trident, Xavier Pendragon, Mitchell Middleton Knight, who was Midnight.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Haha, with a K.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Larsen Tyler, the Eternal Champion.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
You had Chin Wo, Dawson McShane, who was kind of fun.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Ramses the Third, Raven Gendar, Senator, and Riptide De Medici.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
People love to hate on those De Medicis, I swear, but they were all busy killing each other and being Pope.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Then you had Blast Chavez, and then some animals.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
This game looks kind of derpy though.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
It is kind of derpy, but it was classic.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Fair enough, fair enough.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Classically derpy.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
There was the Slurpee flavor that was Sega Eternal Champions Cherry.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And it was at 7-Eleven, of course.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Then there were game books that came out that were released by Puffin Books.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:34.000
There was a comic about this that was called Eternal Champions Special that was done by the UK Sega Magazine, Sonic the Comic.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Do you remember the group Bone Thugs and Harmony?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Yes, I do.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:51.000
They basically sampled Eternal Champions for their songs Eternal and Crossroad.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Really? Crossroad samples Eternal Champions? That was like their biggest hit.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And Courage the Cowardly Dog also used some of the same audio loops from the game.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:10.000
EGM actually sponsored Eternal Champions tournaments, which I remember a few people...

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I think I knew one person who actually was in one of those a while back, but don't quote me on that.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And then, like I said, it came with the Activator.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000
There is a special moves edition that was a handheld tiger game.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
It basically was just a really crappy version of Eternal Champions.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And basically it was a pretty mediocre game.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I mean, I thought that the Sega CD one was better.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:50.000
And then they were going to do Eternal Champions the Final Chapter for the Saturn, but they cancelled it so that they could push Virtua Fighter in the US.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I would like to know if there is a prototype of this sitting around because I would love to see it.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
So yeah, as far as the spin-offs, there was one called Chicago Syndicate.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:06.000
It came out on the Game Gear in 1995 that was based on an alternate reality where Lars and Tyler didn't die in 1920.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And then there's Expert X-PERTS.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000
There's a side-scrolling beat-em-up that is based on one where Shadow Yamato didn't die.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
So, yeah.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Eternal Champions.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Overkill.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I think this one you get eaten by a shark.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Yeah, I'm waiting to see if they get to the...

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
They keep pausing it, so I'm assuming they're looking up the fatality or whatever.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Or whatever is followed in this game.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Overkill.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
What was the game that had the ones that were called Cinekills?

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Do you remember that one?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
There was a game that called it that and I don't remember what it is.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Was it Time Killers?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Maybe it was Time Killer. Hold on, I'll find out.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Time Killer was the one where you chopped off the body parts. It was funny.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Alright, there it is. Your classic Game of the Week Eternal Champions for the Mega Drive.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.000
They were Cinekills in Eternal Champion CD is what they were.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
That's what it was.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
I knew it was one of them.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Alright, we are going to take a quick break and then we'll be back with more Orange Laundry tonight.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
We have a not-so-serious Fugu Question of the Week tonight that should be fun.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
A little more news out of PAX East. Hopefully some calls, we're hoping.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
And, yes, Jamie's going to talk a little more about Mass Effect.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
But don't worry guys, not too much.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Hey!

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
All that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Live on this Sunday evening, March the 24th, 2013.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Episode number 498 of our program in progress.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Hello to those of you guys.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Apparently we've got a few folks, I've been messaging IRC and just got some text messages,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
that are listening to us in the car on the way back from PAX East.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
So, hello you lucky shits.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Drive safely.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
No, drive recklessly. Faster, faster. I'm kidding. Please drive safe.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Don't be driving drunk either.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Dark Sakura will kick your ass.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Alright, let's get back into some rapid fire news.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Rob, there are things that are more painful to kick than the ass.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Dark Sakura will kick you in the taint, or the ah-bra.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
She will snap your ah-bra.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I will cut a bitch.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Alright.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And she'll say, you mad bra?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Rapid fire news time, Loki.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And there's things locally I wish I could buy.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Borderlands 2, they're teasing a while back, South by Southwest,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
that there is going to be a brand new character class.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Well, PAX East, they finally revealed what that's going to be.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:50.000
It is Krieg the Psycho, or Krieg the, I guess, I don't know what you call it,

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
the Reformed Psycho.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
He's basically a psycho from the game.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.000
His primary form of attack is melee, which sounds lame actually when you think about it,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
because this is a game about guns,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
and also because the character I've been actually playing as Zero has a melee attack,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
and I fucking hate using it, because I thought it cool.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I'm like, hey, cool, I have a samurai sword, I'm going to chop through people.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
No, I just shoot them in the head and kill them.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And of course also there's going to be an Ultimate Vault Hunter upgrade pack on April 2nd.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
It's going to raise the game's level cap from 50 to 61.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Not 60, but 61.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
That's so much bigger.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And I guess the upgrade pack will be part of the season pass, so that's cool.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.000
The psycho pack will not be part of the season pass content.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And also I guess the upgrade pack is going to have the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.000
which of course will raise the level caps of all the enemies in the third playthrough.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
And of course the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, that's going to be,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
if you don't have the season pass, five bucks for 400 Microsoft points.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Also the psycho pack is 999 or 800 Microsoft points.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
That's coming in May at some point.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And last piece of DLC I guess is coming out in June, and that's going to be part of the campaign.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Let's see here.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Now I'm laughing because I just got a text from Bobby Blackwolf saying,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I'm driving recklessly.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Yell at Bobby Thar, Sakura. Yell at him.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Ehh!

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Fi! Fi!

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
That's my new word by the way.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
No, we haven't done anything worthy of cancellation tonight.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Yet.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
In this half of the show.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Alright. Sorry, Loki.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Dust and Lesion Tales coming to Steam.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And nowhere to win, but it is coming.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.000
They're going to be, I guess, not going to be doing a whole lot different than the other versions.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
But at least it'll look nice if I didn't see them.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And then the thing I want to know, is anyone going to fucking buy this game?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Because I kind of want to buy this game, but I want people to play with it.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
No one answered me on Twitter, so fuck them.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I'm sure that they had more important things to do.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Wait, I think that was actually before PAX, so fuck you guys for not responding back in the first place.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And I bet if you ask on Tumblr, you'll just get a bunch of likes and no answers.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Yeah. So, but yes. Duke Nukem 3D has come out on Steam as part of this Megaton edition.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:42.000
It's basically Duke Nukem kind of remastered with all the, basically, you know, I knew that they had expansion packs, but I never knew anything was actually kind of official.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I thought it was just kind of this third, like a company making like a skin or something and selling it.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Yeah, I always thought it was a bunch of homegrown shit.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
But apparently it was official stuff.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Wait, but I have the actual Duke Nukem 3D Mega Edition CD-ROM. I can't just use that. I have to get the Steam version so I can play through Steam, right?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
I think so, yeah.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Bitches. How much is it?

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Ten dollars.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
You know, I may have to do this. I'm tempted.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
It's Duke Nukem 3D, the Atomic Edition, so you got your four campaigns right there.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Plus the three bundled expansions, Duke's Caribbean, Life is a Beach, Duke, Nuclear Winter, and Duke it Out in DC.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:23.000
And I guess, you know, the PC and Mac, and they're the OpenGL versions of the game.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Duke Nukem's in our chat right now. Well, hail to the king, baby!

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Saying, I used to have the Kiloton collection. That was official, I believe. That's the one we have.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Actually, Alan has it, and I just stole it.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Well, I got to Duke Nukem 3D when they were doing that thing with, was it, Good Ol' Games a while back, so I got that.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000
But they're going to add online multiplayer later on, I guess, via Steamworks and Linux support.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
What? It doesn't have it right now?

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
No.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Then why would I buy it?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Instant gratification.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I don't care about that. I want, here's what I want, as part of, you know, Steamworks, I want custom app supports.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Because, man, I used to make Duke Nukem apps all day long, man.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:06.000
That was, I had one, I love this story.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I had one where it was basically a water park, or water slide. It was just the moving water, and you would kind of go along with it and move really fast.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And there was a drop, because you take no fall damage, you fall in water.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
So, the drop was done with holding page down, it would lower the floor.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I put a paperweight on page down and went and had lunch, and it came back later on.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
That drop was five minutes long!

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
It was great!

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
But then how do you get back up to the top?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Super fast elevator. And if you hit the super fast elevator the wrong way, it will cause you to explode. But, it was awesome.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I'm only interested in this when it gets online multiplayer. I can't believe you set this whole thing up and you can't play it.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Like, why would I buy it right now?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I forgot, okay? Because I haven't bought it yet.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
But you should buy it here. This is Duke Nukem.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
I'll buy it when it's online multiplayer.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Yeah, exactly. Maybe we should wait until Steam Sale comes.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Yeah, I was going to say, and it'll be, the summer Steam Sale gets here, it'll be like $350.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Excited.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Well, I mean, in the meantime, Gary's Mod, $3.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
They should just give it to anybody who bought Duke Nukem Forever.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Right? Like an apology?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
We're sorry, here.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Like the SimCity thing.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Or like boob wall mode.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Alright, meanwhile, here's what I'll be playing on Steam.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Civilization V, a great Steam game. Another expansion coming out.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I was not expecting this, but Civ V Brave New World is the next expansion.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
It will be launching in July.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I didn't catch everything that's supposed to be in this game,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
but apparently one of the things they're adding are units from XCOM squads,

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
which is a little silly, but okay, it can work.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
There are going to be paratroopers who drop in 40 units away,

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
as opposed to 9 units away.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
So, alright, I can kind of see why they're doing that.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
But I kind of missed what else was supposed to be big about this expansion.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Damn, there's not even the video of the XCOM units there anymore.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:02.000
But, alright, if it's a Civ V expansion, I'm going to get it anyway.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I will buy that just as fast as Dark Tetsuya will be buying this next game.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
It's La Mulana, which has a launch date now for Steam.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It's April 15th, just in time.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
File your taxes, and then play an even greater enemy in La Mulana.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Or someone can get it for me for my birthday.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Perhaps, but your birthday isn't yet.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Not on April 15th.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
It isn't yet, but it's that week.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
But your birthday is a two-week celebration, correct?

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
My birthday is a fucking month celebration. What are you talking about?

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
It's a holiday in my universe.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
So, anyhow, La Mulana is going to be on Steam on April 15th.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
It's the remake of La Mulana, they say.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Anyhow, it'll be $15, but if you pre-order, you get a whole 10% off.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
That's $13.50, y'all.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.000
This is the version that's based on the WiiWare game, which took forever to come out.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
But the Steam version will have the WiiWare DLC, Hell Temple.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Because, you know, the game wasn't hard enough.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000
You can plug in a USB controller, like your Xbox 360 controller, and the controller away.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Interesting comment this week from some of the folks behind Super Meat Boy.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Tommy Refens, talking about DRM in the wake of all the SimCity hubble blue going on.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Saying that basically DRM is how developers shoot themselves in the foot.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Companies try to combat piracy of their software with DRM, but if loss due to pirated software is not calculable to an accurate amount,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
does the implementation of DRM provide a return on investment?

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
It is impossible to say yes to this statement.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:39.000
The reality of our current software age is the internet is more efficient at breaking things than companies are at creating them.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.000
A company will spend massive amounts of money on DRM and the internet will break it in a matter of days in most cases.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
When the DRM is broken, is it worth the money spent to implement it?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Did the week of unbroken DRM for your game gain you any sales from potential pirates due to the inability to pirate at launch?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Again, there's no way of telling, and as such, cannot be used as an accurate justification for spending money.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Now, hold on though.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:11.000
As much as you want to go, yeah, DRM sucks, and I do think overdoing DRM is pretty bad.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:17.000
The Steam DRM doesn't annoy me, but some of these DRMs that we've heard about in the past where you get knocked offline and so forth,

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.000
that stuff annoys me. And the SimCity stuff, for me, that was really never an issue with the DRM.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I didn't really care. Just the fact that you had to play SimCity through Origin, I knew it was going to be bad.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But some folks are playing it and enjoying it, so you know what, more power to you.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I'm having fun with my games, you have fun with yours.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But here's the thing about this whole comment.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Did the week of unbroken DRM for your game gain you any sales from potential pirates?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:51.000
See, I would argue maybe, because the most critical time for new game sales is that first week.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:58.000
So yeah, if a copy protection or whatever scheme can hold things off for a week, then yeah, actually it might be worth it.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
But at what price?

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And that's the problem I have, is that when that DRM starts to step on the toes of the legitimate player, that's when I have a problem with it.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And when you have a game like SimCity where the DRM is really bad, as far as the launch week was all messed up,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
you may have people that are just like, you know what, I'm just not going to pirate that game.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Because I don't want to play it.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And also, the next game that someone put out, they just may not care anymore.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
They say, I had such a bad experience with this, I'm not going to buy this game.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I'm kind of done dumping on SimCity. There's just a million other games right now that are worthy of my time that I'll play instead.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Like The Walking Dead. The intro video. I kid you not, and you can even see this in the reviews.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Yeah, I saw the video. That was bad. The mouse is still there.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
The mouse pointer.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
That's bad.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Really? Really? Come on. That just says, I'm bragging about how little effort I put into this game. That's what that says.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.000
And it's so sad that there's like, there's bad walking dead and there's good walking dead.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And the bad walking dead, people bought a lot, I'm sure a lot of people bought a lot of because,

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
or stores brought in copies of because the last one did really well.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Not knowing that the two have nothing in common except that they're based loosely on the same thing,

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
even though the good ones from the comics and the bad ones from the TV show, right?

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Yeah.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
That's unfortunate.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:41.000
ActDeft in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says, everyone should play The Walking Dead. The telltale game, of course.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Dungeon Buster speaking about SimCity in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says, it has other issues outside of the always online thing.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Let's watch the broken traffic go in circles. I find the whole limited space, extremely limited space for the city kind of interesting.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Now, granted, the old SimCity games had that too.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:09.000
But the fact that people have broken it so that you can go outside those lines is really curious to me.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:17.000
But again, I had no interest in SimCity before. I really don't now. Let's move on.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I like a nap instead of SimCity. That sounds better.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
No nap. Stories.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Eh. Rap.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
This is supposedly rapid fire news that's been going on for 20 minutes now.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I know, right?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Speaking of The Walking Dead, by the way, it's supposed to be coming out on Vita, the telltale version, that is, as in the good one.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:41.000
So you can play it on the Vita. They don't know when, or if it's even going to be episodic or if it's going to be all at once.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
But it'll be there, so they say.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
There's also the Indie Springs sale going on Steam right now.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Which, Rob, like I told you earlier, you need to get to the moon.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Everybody who is listening to my voice, get to the moon.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I even was considering getting Dark Souls Prepare to Die, because it was half off too.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:09.000
I also picked up DLC Quest. I forgot to mention. I didn't play it, but I picked it up. It was like three packs.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I need to get that.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Incredibly short.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
About an hour worth of your time.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
For three bucks.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Three bucks, that's not a waste.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.000
There's a lot worse things I could spend for an hour of my time.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:30.000
There's also Runner 2, Future Legend of the Rhythm Alien, Super Hexagon, Proteus, Retro City Rampage, and VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I'm just gonna call it VVVVVVVVVVVVV

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Which is a flipping great game, but everybody should've got it in that bundle.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Ah ha!

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
A flipping great game.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Home in Jamestown, and Kentucky Route Zero.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000
To the Moon, though, I am in love with that game.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I'm playing it very slowly on purpose.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
To the Moon, Jamie! To the Moon!

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I'm basically playing a level a week so that I can sort of draw out the game.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Because it's really, I really think it's adorable.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
As I mentioned, Gary's mod for three bucks.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:11.000
And Diablo 3 is supposed to be on consoles, but not necessarily exclusive to the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It has been confirmed for both, but they're not saying that that's the only place it's gonna be.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Can you imagine if they brought it to the Vita?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
That'd be pretty sweet.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
That'd be cool.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Leaving the door open, though, for the Xbox 360 and the Wii U.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I could see the Wii U.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I want unicorns and ponies edition.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
There's nothing but that map.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
You need to go to Whimsieville or whatever it's called.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Yeah, they need to have the Whimsieville edition.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
There's nothing but Whimsieville quests.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Whimsieville's kinda hard, actually, but...

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Isn't it Whimsie Shire or something?

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Who cares?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Ponies and unicorns.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
And fairies and rainbows and barf.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Specific, specific, specifics.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000
CatastrophicMoggie in our chat room wants to know, are you excited for the To the Moon sequel?

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Yes!

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Called To the Venus.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
No, I just made that up.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
To the Butt.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
No, I will be excited when I finish To the Moon.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Alright, that does it for rapid fire news tonight, so let's go to our FUGL question of the week.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
It's very awkward.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
We ask a question on Facebook and a question on Google.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
We collect your responses.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
You slam Facebook and Google together, you get Google.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
And this week, you guys, not a serious question.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
We decided to have a little fun with it this week.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
In the spirit of PAX East and our upcoming 500th episode,

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:37.000
a lot of you have joked in the past that you'd like to see a VOGCON or some type of IRL event.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
What would a VOGCON or your dream convention consist of?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
So we're talking about people's dream conventions.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
GamerGirl on Facebook starting us off saying,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:53.000
I think it would consist of DDR event in house, whoever's it would be at, pizza, Mass Effect, and Pinkberry.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
That's just a Friday night at Jamie's. What are you talking about?

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Actually, that literally is a Friday night at my house.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Because that's exactly what I was doing.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
VOGCON is suddenly she comes to slumber party at Jamie's.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
That would be fun.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Haseo Tsumuragawa says, VOGCON should have Loki in the Tingle costume. Just saying.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Just get over it. I mean, seriously.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000
If you really want it to happen, Eye of Judgment would have worked. It just didn't, okay?

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
You know what, you should actually, you just should wear your Sackboy outfit.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I should have made that same bet with, you know, the frickin' wonder books.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
That thing flopped almost faster than.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
You should have made the same bet with the Wii U.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Oh, alright. Moving on.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
That did still mill and copy, so.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Well then yes, you should have made the same bet with the Wii U.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
In January, no.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Alright, AZHP responds and says, as someone who goes to conventions.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Don't we all go to conventions at some point?

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Alright, as someone who goes to conventions, I don't really care what actually happens at the event.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
As long as there are cool people to hang out with.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Which basically means that a VOGCON would automatically be the second best convention ever behind Fanime.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Let's be honest, guys. Fair enough.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
I like Fanime.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:12.000
James S. replies and says, alls I know is if Dan and Dark Sakura are in the same building,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
they're not allowed to fight or bicker at one another at all.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Just kidding. Love you guys.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I lolled.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Dark Tetsuya said, I think each show on the network should be represented with a different event.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Like for us, I'm assuming meaning OLR, it would have to be either a classic game or a music game competition.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Celebrating both our roots and video game's roots in general.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I think we'd have to do the music game and let Bobby have the classic game.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Because he, you know, I can't remember his tag on off the top of my head.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
But you know, he talks about gaming's history and all that.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Fabrice A. replies and says, Dan should host a DDR tournament called Dan's Central.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
He would, you know what Dan's reply to that would be?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Dan's Central.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
He'd make his gorilla face and go, really?

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.000
That got a like from Tiara, essentially. She replied and said seconded, essentially.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
She would.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Alright. Osefer has an answer. Oh boy.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:22.000
A vogcon would consist of different gingerbread treats and fuzzy red teddy bears named Rob.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Your sexy gingerbread legs.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000
The rave would only play disco disco and main dinner entrees would always be garnished with oranges.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Mmm, vog themed alcoholic drinks.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
A gingerbread legs martini sounds nice.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Some cinnamon rum and butterscotch schnapps.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
You got problems.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Eww, that sounds nasty.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
That's so nasty.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Let's go to Code Man with hopefully a...

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I like Code Man.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Less scary answer.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Hanging with the people that I listen to so much and finally, in other words, putting faces to the people that I love listening to.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Oh, and of course, DDR, Pinkberry, because I've never had it.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Loki in a tingle costume.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.000
And most of all, and I repeat this, everyone that makes VOG a network meshing together and having a great time.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Because in the end, that's what matters most.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.000
And then you follow that up with, oh, and Taco Cabana for Shane, which Shane liked.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
See, I like Code Man.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Who doesn't like tacos?

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I'm gonna give a like for tacos as well.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I like Code Man. Code Man's cool.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Yeah, he's cool.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
We've been supposedly playing Mass Effect 3 online for like two weeks.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
You know what? My next lol effect picture is going to involve tacos.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Amazing.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Everything should involve tacos.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
In this case, it'll be indigestion.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Daniel N. replies and says, if I can see the OLR cast and Bobby get back on a DDR pad, and Bobby is in caps,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:57.000
get back on a DDR pad on Heavy as they are now and a tattoo artist on hand to do Mass Effect art, that would be a good VOG con.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I believe, and I'm sure I'll get a text message in a few minutes here if I'm incorrect,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I don't believe Bobby was ever a DDR player.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
He was way more into Beatmania and all that.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
You know what's actually funny?

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Well, since I've been getting on my big fitness kick, we're actually gonna be hooking back up the DDR in my house.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I would play DDR. I would bring back my alter ego, Dr. Dick, one last time at VOG con.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I liked Mr. Spanky.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
But you wouldn't cosplay him.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Remember when I did the DDR tour?

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Do you still have the hat?

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I'm too fat to cosplay Mr. Spanky, and if you think these comments from Ossifer are creepy now...

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Rob, Mr. Spanky was bigger than you.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Okay? I saw Mr. Spanky and that was disgusting.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
That is true.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
By the way, do you still have the hat?

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
That orange fuzzy hat?

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I might, actually.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.000
You know what I found when I was looking for my art supplies the other day?

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
The orange bat.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I still have that. I know I have that.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I have my orange bat.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I think mine might still have the signatures on it.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Mine does.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Nice.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Some comments from Google+. We can't forget Google+.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Flaco Jones saying,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.000
How about a trophy presentation to the winningest VOG the game participant of all time?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Seriously though, any kind of hangout with each show getting a chance to take the stage would be cool.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And in Vegas, of course.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Nobody else suggesting the location.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I mean, we're in Sacramento, but there's lots of people on VOG.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
So, we'd have to hold it in some type of central location.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
So, anyhow.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Going next to actdeft.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000
For me, a VOGCon would just simply consist of hanging with all my fellow VOG staffers in the VOG community.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Playing games, talking or discussing.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Maybe doing a special show for all the listeners.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And doing what friends do. Enjoying the moment with each other.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Aww.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Excuse me, hairball.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
And lastly, Rettertainment.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Loki in a tingle costume.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
That is like three people that said that.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
It's not gonna happen.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
You got the closest thing.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
The Sackboy was pretty epic.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000
An artistic reenactment of what that would look like.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
And that was it.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Alright, awesome.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I actually read all the answers tonight.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000
But join us on Facebook or Google Plus for future questions.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
We'll do some more serious ones next time.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
But I thought that would be a fun question to ask.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
What's your dream convention?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I will say this.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
VOG may not be having a convention this year.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
But we're gonna be heavily represented at DragonCon this year.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So I would say if you're in that southeast part of the country.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Or even if you're not.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Because I'm not. Really try to plan on that.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Because I'll be there representing OLR.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Travis will be there representing Under Sedation Live.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I'm pretty sure Pod Culture usually goes.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I'm sure they're still figuring it out.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Critical Myth I'm positive will be there.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Bobby will be there. British Invaders went last year.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
So they'll probably go this year.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
The only show that probably won't be there.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I even think Rama is talking about going.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I could be wrong.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
But he went to Atlanta for something else.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
So he can go to DragonCon.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
The only one that I wouldn't know would be Girls Gone Wow.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And if we can make that happen.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Then Lordy we will fly one of their asses in from the UK if we could.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
So that would be fun.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Wouldn't you want to party with Sil?

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
I would love for people to send me a ticket so I can go to DragonCon.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
You can get on a bus.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Dark Sakura across America.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Alright.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
There you go.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Our foogle question of the week.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Let's get back into some more news about video games.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Loki.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Alright.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
So let's see.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Double Fine.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000
You remember they had that wonderful Kickstarter that kind of brought Kickstarter to the forefront?

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Well Double Fine Adventures now has a name.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
It is called Broken Age.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
And I guess it was revealed at PAX East.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
They even have a website now for it at brokenagegame.com.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
And basically here's what it is.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Broken Age is a point and click adventure game telling the stories of a young boy and girl leading parallel lives.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000
The girl has been chosen by her village to be sacrificed to a terrible monster but she decides to fight back.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Meanwhile a boy on a spaceship is living a solitary life under the care of a motherly computer.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
But wants to break free and lead an adventure and do good in the world.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Adventure ensues.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Adventure ensues.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
That's the most important part.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Yes.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Hijinks occur.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:24.000
If you didn't back the Kickstarter you can preorder the game via the website.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
And yeah.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
So it looks neat.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I don't really know.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I'll have to see when the game comes out.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Well a lot of people already bought it.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Yeah.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:45.000
It's going to be one of the first games to come out that just besides maybe what Diablo 3 where they just give a million of them away because people already bought them.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Yeah.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
So.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Alright.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Anyhow.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Some updates from Xbox games on demand.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Some reasons why day and date launches don't always make it to games on demand.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:06.000
You know there's a big push to try and get games delivered digitally at the exact same time they show up in stores because you know the convenience of downloading them and needing to have that game right now.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Really goes a long way in selling them.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I know a lot of people bought Luigi's Mansion digitally because it came out right at midnight.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
And a lot of people were like I can't even wait the six hours to get to the store.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Or I guess more than six.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.000
But you know what I mean.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Anyhow.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Eric Yeager the senior business manager of Xbox games on demand.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000
This is why titles don't launch day and date alongside retail releases.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Quote.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
We have a lot of strong partnerships with retailers.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
We really need them to do a lot for us.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
They're the ones out there selling the consoles.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Selling the peripherals.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
And in this time we're trying to figure out how to fit that into the whole digital landscape shift.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
We're just taking a bit of measured pace with it.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000
So very interesting.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Sort of kind of the converse of what you're seeing with Nintendo.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:54.000
That they're actually purposely giving a little breathing room to the retailers.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Which is ironic considering those rumors that gained yet again more steam this week.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.000
We didn't put it on the show roll tonight because it's the same fucking rumor we've heard for a couple months.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.000
But more stuff out there apparently indicating that Xbox the new one will always be online.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I don't think it's actually going to be online only.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
What do you think?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I think that people are misinterpreting what it is.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
You think it's more of a.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I was on that.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I was on that boat too until I read closer and thought about a little bit.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
I think the wording just a little weird.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.000
But what they basically said makes sense.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
And I think it's going to be.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
First off there's a few reasons.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
One.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
It's incredibly risky to do that.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Because if they're the only company doing that.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Remember they have shareholders to answer to.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000
And they can't necessarily just go do this thing where.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Hey we're going to go ahead and cut out all of the retail marketplace.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Hahaha.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000
You know we're going to sell games digitally only.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Or you know we're going to basically prevent you from buying.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
You know selling your game used and that kind of thing.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Here's what they basically said.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.000
This is coming from some screenshots of the software development kit.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
On vgleaks.com.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
And basically they said.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Where I'm trying to find this exact.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Durango will implement different power states.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
So it can be powered on.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
We'll draw minimal electricity blah blah blah.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Kind of like the Playstation 4.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
It says with this always on always connected design.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
And now but see that's where everyone's like.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Oh always on always connected.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
They said the console will be ready instantly when users want to play.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.000
And will maintain a network connection so that the console software and games are always current.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000
I think the always on always connected means that it's going to have a standby.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
And it's going to download those updates for your game.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
And system updates when it's in standby.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
So you don't have to fucking wait for an update to happen.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
That makes more sense.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000
So I mean this was the same marketing spiel behind we connect 24.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Even though obviously that didn't do the system updates and stuff.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
I mean the way that reads is an awful lot like they pitched we connect 24.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000
But see all these blogging sites and some of these guys that are trying to get near these headlines.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
And trust me I bought into it too until I finally read it.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Always on always connected like oh there you go.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
It's got to always be connected to the internet.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000
No I think if you want to use this feature where your console updates itself.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000
In standby so you don't have to wait for these updates and doesn't have to reset and stuff.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
That's what they mean by this.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It's a feature so that because no one fucking likes waiting for these updates to happen.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
You're trying to play a game and oh I got to wait five minutes for this shit to download.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
That's what they're trying to prevent.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.000
And so I think that no use games will be a thing.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I think that this is what they're trying to do.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000
And I think that everyone's going to be like very mistaken when they come out and announce this shit.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Well thank God it'll all be settled in less than a month hopefully at this point.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Because the announcement is supposed to be in April right?

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
The end of April.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Please let this be over with soon.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Dark Soccer in the meantime.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Well I have Mass Effect news.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
As we warned you.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
But this is actually really sad.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:05.000
They're basically going into how seamless it was to get the character of Nirene the Female Turian in the Omega DLC.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
That it was actually really smooth to get her accepted.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Except that that's really an exception to the case.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.000
We've had plenty of games go through where a female character has been proposed.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.000
And the game is shot down simply because of the gender of the main player, the protagonist.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Like Remember Me was shot down for the same reason.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
And that there's a statement going out that basically.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:38.000
And I really liked this statement here that's by the creative director for Remember Me.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Jean Maxime Morris said if you think that there's no way this medium is going to mature.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
So it's really a lot of misogyny we need to.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Those stats they put out for that Mass Effect 3 panel were pretty eye opening though.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
What was it only 18%?

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
18% of players beat it with Female Shepherd.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000
But that is, if you'll notice, the loudest part of the fandom.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Is that 18%.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000
And honestly I chalk that up to bros.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Caden is a squadmate less than 2% of the time.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I couldn't believe that.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
That's because he was a whiny bitch.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Kidding.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
So are you but you've been on 100% of these shows.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Yeah I've been on more like 95%.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Still.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
But the other thing too is that they almost didn't make Tally playable in Mass Effect 3.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Which would have been a shame.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Basically enough people were passionate about it that they made her playable.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
But I guess that might have to be why she wasn't even available until like halfway through the game.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
And I mean I've been running across people who say,

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Oh she's so irritating, she's so annoying.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
I was like, hell she was great.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Even though she's not like a very strong squadmate.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000
I remember reading some story and I don't know if there's something you'd put on Tumblr or where.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000
But that a lot of characters weren't playable in Mass Effect 2.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Because they didn't want you to get them killed before 3.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Well yeah that was it too.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.000
They were saying because they were part of I guess something that they had in mind for 3.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
So that's why they didn't have them playable.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000
But still I think that everybody should have been playable for the last one.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
There's a lot of stuff that could have gone better about Mass Effect 3.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Some of those PAX East panels weren't broadcast. I hope they post them online like the BioWare one.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Me too. I'd love to see that actually.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Yeah.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Alright. Well we'll get to the mailbag shortly.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Or no. Do we get any emails this week?

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000
No. Just the one that was just more for direction.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Are we reading it or no? I guess not.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Alright.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
I checked. There's nothing else so.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Well shame on all of you guys for not emailing us.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Yeah how dare you.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Well we still have some news stories.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Well thank you capstrapootmoggy. I like tally as well.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Alright we still have some news stories for you guys.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Loki.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.000
So this is kind of cool. There's a partnership that was announced by Sony and Unity.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Basically the Unity engine will now have ways to port games to the Playstation platform.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Including Playstation 4, PS3, Vita and Playstation Mobile.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:21.000
And using these I guess it will be easier to take advantage of different system stuff.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Like the cameras and the touchpads and that kind of stuff.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Playstation Network.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:35.000
And they say also because of that it will allow people to port titles easier to iOS and Android as well.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000
And I guess there's already some games that have used this.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Including Might and Delight's PID and Funbit's Escape Plan.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Oh I saw Funbit's Escape Plan.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Oh that was built in that game? That's pretty cool.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Remember that. That was the launch title.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
PID and Funbit. Or PID.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000
What's PID?

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I have no idea. PID is.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
But yeah. Escape Plan looked kind of cool.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
So cool.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
And I know a lot of people use Unity for all sorts of things.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000
So porting games will be easier.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000
And it sounds like that they kind of are embracing kind of indie development a little bit better.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I think they're finding out that hey these indie titles that we're bringing over to like the Vita and stuff seem to be doing well for us.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Let's get them more involved with other consoles.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Making it easier to get your game on there. So I like that.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Is this something that will be for PlayStation 3 and 4?

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Yeah. It's all stuff. 3, 4, Vita and mobile.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Well that's pretty cool.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Again it's with a new console coming out this year it seems like there's so much still on the PlayStation 3.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Yeah it's kind of hard to sell your next console when there's all this stuff coming to your current console.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Well you guys remember Street Fighter X Tekken.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:05.000
And it was okay. I don't think it was as good as a lot of people were hoping it would be.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
On Disney or DLC.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
That's one of the things it will be remembered for forever.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Well remember Street Fighter X Tekken wasn't the only game that was supposed to happen there.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000
There was supposed to be another game, Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Which was Namco's version of the game basically.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
As more of a Tekken style fighter.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
No news on that in a while.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:30.000
But producer Katsuhiro Harada responding to a fan on Twitter said quote.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
We are changing and considering platform strategy.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
That's why we don't say anything.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
So a lot of people are speculating that based on that message.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Oh they're going to move it up to PlayStation 4 and the new Xbox.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000
As opposed to the current gen which would make a lot of sense.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000
It would also kind of give them a chance to really reinvent some things.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:55.000
And hopefully make people forget about the fact that they didn't care for Street Fighter X Tekken.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000
So you can't really see how this is bad news.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Except the fact that it's going to be a little while longer before this game comes out.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.000
DarkSakura, I know you're a fighting girl fan.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.000
You're a fighting game girl fan.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Are you excited about Tekken Cross Street Fighter?

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I'm reserving judgement.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
I'm not going to get it right away.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Okay.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Unless that trailer comes out and you're like oh my god.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Oh my god Jen. Oh my god Ryu.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
So we'll see.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I like even this little teaser image. Ryu looks great.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
I like him kind of the Tekken style.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Well I even have to say that I've always been a fan of the Street Fighter characters done in the style of another game.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Like remember SNK?

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I loved their renditions of the Street Fighter characters.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Not on the show roll tonight but I want to say I heard that CVS2 is supposed to be coming out for PlayStation Classics or something like that.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
So you can get it on PS3.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000
That would sort of be a big why for me.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Because it's awesome.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Because I've already got it.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Yeah.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
I would like to see it re-release. You could do like online battles would be pretty cool but.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000
For matching service. We need more games that say for matching service in the title.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
We do need.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000
You know I've actually got the Vampire Savior for matching service.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000
That I forgot completely that we actually owned that game.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000
So I might sell it.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Did you ever read gamer girl's comment in chat here Loki about PID?

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.000
PID is a side scroller in which you play a little boy who gets lost and gets put on a planet and has to find his way home.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
And she gives you a link there to PID.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000
All right.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Tigerclaw following up with the Mass Effect information from earlier saying there was some mention about the Mass Effect movie during that panel.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
But nothing like when it's coming out because I don't think they even started.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
They've never even. They haven't even started yet.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.000
You know I'd probably see it out of morbid fascination but I just wouldn't.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:56.000
For me. I am so deeply entrenched into the game playing as a female shepherd that to think of playing it as a guy is inconceivable to me.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
I really hope somebody puts their foot down and makes it a fem chef.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
I can. I really do.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:06.000
I think it would be a great character but I don't know.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:17.000
I also kind of want them to really fuck with the fandom and do something really atrocious in the game like do a decision that like can't even happen in the game.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Like have Caden and Ashley survive Vermaier or like something that just totally like makes fan boys and fan girls just like what are you doing.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I really want that to happen.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I want Dark Soccer to twitch nervously when she's watching Mass Effect.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Honestly. I wouldn't care.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
I want Garrus to die.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
No! No!

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Oh my god Rob I can't believe you'd say something so horrible.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Okay.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I'm done. I'm gonna leave right now to get my soda.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Alright. This is the part where we would do the mailbag.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Fuck you.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
But you didn't email us. Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Maybe you should do that for next time.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:07.000
So instead we'll go right into the FUs of the week even though this is really not a good time to be doing that but it is what it is.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:23.000
This is fucked up.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:35.000
I have two FUs really. One of them is to my iPad for not supporting Java so that I can sign up for something that Rob's gonna be talking about later.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:40.000
And then my other one goes to the stupid bitch face.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Okay I actually have another one than that.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:48.000
To bitch face number one who was in the car in front of me and one of those homeless guy panhandlers was outside.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:57.000
And she turned on her windshield wipers for the entire period of time that we were at the light and started flinging water at him.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
And it was clearly on purpose because her car was not dirty.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000
You could see all the way through her windshield and back windshield.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
She's just doing it to be a bitch.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
So I gave him 50 cents.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Instead I apologize on behalf of humanity.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Not really. But I did give him money.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.000
And then to my former boss bitch face.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.000
I don't care if you fuck with me. Don't fuck with my friends.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I'm done.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Logie.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Um. I guess I have to be the fact that my coworkers gone so I got no one to talk to.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Yeah.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Fuck my hand for being weak. Thank you Rob.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
I opened a bottle for Dark Sakura.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Cause I'm strong.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Cause all the pressure builds up inside.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Alright.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
And fuck the Mass Effect movie.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000
F you to the freaking wild turkeys in this neighborhood.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
They're all assholes.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Like one of them literally flew right in front of my car today with a death wish.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Wanting me to hit.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
So I have to slam on the brakes.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Thank god there wasn't a car behind me or I probably would have been in an accident.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:11.000
I probably would have gotten whiplash thanks to the stupid fucking turkey that lives near here.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
So F you to the turkeys.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Why you so stupid turkeys?

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Tell me.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Did you know that actually turkeys were rated as one of the most stupid animals to live?

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Well thank god we eat so many of them once a year.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I wouldn't eat the wild turkeys in this neighborhood.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Who knows what the fuck they've been eating.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.000
That's true.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
They probably taste like radiation.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Alright.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
That does it for the FUs of the week.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
A couple more news stories for you guys.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:39.000
And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Or our username on Skype.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
But first a couple stories.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:54.000
So apparently there has been some research into video games and their effects on kids with dyslexia.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
And actually allowing them to be able to read.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
And this is kind of cool.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:03.000
They did a study basically where they had 20 kids.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:08.000
20 dyslexic children playing Rayman's Raving Rabbids.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Which is crazy as it is.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.000
For a total of 12 hours over 9 days.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.000
And of course the game has a ton of crazy mini games and that kind of fun stuff.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:28.000
And basically before and after the 9 days of game playing the researchers tested the kids on several different tasks.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Including reading speed and accuracy, word recognition, and their ability to pay attention to multiple types of input.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Sight and sound at once.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Before playing the games the two groups were both equivalent in these tasks.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:50.000
But after 12 hours of the games the kids that played the mini games showed significant improvements in their ability to read.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:56.000
They read faster, more accurately, and they recognized more words than they had before the treatment.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Meanwhile the children that had played non-active mini games didn't do any better on the tests.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
So that's kind of neat.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I think that's a great story with all the crap that video games get sometimes.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I'm glad to hear something where it's bona fide showing that it's helping in a particular scenario here.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000
You know, helping children with this. It's great.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.000
It's almost like all those years spent telling mom it improves my hand-eye coordination.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Like now there's the science to back it up.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Yes.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
But the science has always been there.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
I mean for the sake of reading.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
And this is something actually we learned in typography.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:38.000
The human brain will read lowercase letters better than it will read anything that's all caps.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000
A good reader reads the shape of the words, not the individual letters.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:50.000
So doing something that's going to improve time cognition for getting instinctive action over slow and methodical picking it out

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.000
would definitely, I think, improve that skill when it comes to actually reading a shape of a word.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000
You know that's really funny because when I was studying broadcast journalism

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:04.000
whenever you look at scripts for TV shows and stuff or the teleprompters, everything's always written in caps.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000
And it's not, you know, everybody makes that joke like, why are you yelling though?

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
But they actually say it's to make you slow down.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
That's why they write scripts like that.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Exactly.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Because it's the opposite of what you're saying.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
I'll say one more thing on the subject.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.000
They were doing a study of different types of readers.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000
You know, basically really slow, really low level readers and then higher level readers.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000
And they timed blink rates and pause rates for when people were reading.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:40.000
And the slower readers would blink and pause more often, usually in the middle of a word as opposed to at the end of sections of words.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Very cool.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000
All right. One more news story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.000
And it's about a sequel to an old favorite here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Gravity Entertainment recently announced Ragnarok Online 2.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Actually, this wasn't years ago they announced this.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Yeah, yeah, but I don't care because I'm signing up.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Ragnarok Online 2, Legend of the Second.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
With music done by Yoko Kanno.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Really?

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Yeah.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000
That's awesome.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Apparently, this game is now finally almost here.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000
It's supposed to be an open beta in mid-April.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Pre-registration is available.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
You can also check it out on the Facebook page.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I want to check out this little trailer here in studio.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.000
And if it goes anything like the last Ragnarok Online, it's going to be in beta for seven years.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Most likely.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Is there any actual gameplay in this video, or is it just a bunch of frickin' cutscenes?

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.000
No, but there's YouTube video from the alpha.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Will I get to fight, what were they called, Prinnies, the little slime people?

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Pourings.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Pourings.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Oh, Prinnies are the dudes from Disgaea. What am I thinking?

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Oh my god, the alphas look so awesome.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Okay, how long did I play Ragnarok Online, Rob?

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I don't know, how long until they banned you!

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000
No, no they didn't. I actually played, I was one of, let's put it this way,

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000
if I go back and play the International Ragnarok Online right now,

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.000
I can get all of my characters back and all of my old stuff because I was in the alpha.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Because you're a super nerd and you have a badge to prove it.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.000
I sure do.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Alright, well let us know if you're able to get in the beta for Ragnarok Online 2 and don't get banned.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Alright.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
I've never been banned!

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
You're banned from this show, get out.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I used to be friends with some of the GMs, shit.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Alright, we are at the end of our news, so we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.000
And I'm hoping we're going to hear from some people that went to PAX East tonight.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
So we're going to open up the phones and see what happens.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.000
1-877-GAME-OLR is the toll free number you can use to call.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:48.000
But remember, if you do call us on Skype, you want to call ECHO123 first, just to test your connection.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Oh, phone's already lighting up, we got a call.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
I'm driving recklessly, guys.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Hey, Bobby!

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:00.000
I just got in the door.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
You just literally walked in the door back from PAX East.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
But is the fence still intact?

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Yes! It is.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Is it offensive?

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000
No, did you hear about Bobby's fence drama?

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000
No.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Oh, about the people cutting through his yard?

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Yeah.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:20.000
And then the kids that decided once I locked it that they needed to teach me a lesson by tearing it down?

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Fuck them.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Then didn't you get it all fixed and then a little mini tornado took it out anyway or something?

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.000
They took one of the other signs. The mini tornado took my 99 cent no trespassing sign.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
So I had to replace that.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
I'm not reporting that to my insurance, though.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
You were not having luck this week.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000
But then you got to go to PAX East and hopefully that made it all better, right?

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Yes, it did.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Well, how was it?

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:51.000
It was great. I had a great time. I met a lot of people, especially from the community, and I wanted to open up with this.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.000
And I told him I was going to say this.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Because I've been listening to OLR for a long time. Maybe not all ten years.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:07.000
But I've been listening to OLR and a lot of times during OLR I always roll my eyes because what do I hear near the end of the show?

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Hi, this is Legend of Zaku. How are you doing, Rob?

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000
So I actually got to meet Legend of Zaku.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:22.000
And he's actually an energetic, interesting, fun person to be around.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
He's nothing like what you hear on Sunday night.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000
He's a great guy, and I hope he's on to hear this.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Because people in the past have actually said, like, why do you let that guy on your show?

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:38.000
And I'm like, because if you meet him, he's actually kind of cool, so stay pressed.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Every gamer has a voice, right?

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
And he's basically saying, yeah, I'm just chill because I have to work the next morning and everything.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.000
But Friday night he's bouncing off the walls and everything.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Good times.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
I just wanted to give that little insight to OLR.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Yeah, he's like, hi, this is Legend of Zaku.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000
No, he actually does have a personality, and it's a good one.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.000
You've got to pound on the keyboard.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Alright.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000
So you got to meet a lot of people, right?

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Like, SSJ100Matt was there, right?

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
I met SSJ100Matt a couple times.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
I met Jon from Critical Myth.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Met up with him.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Met up with Ranma and a bunch of people from the cosplay group that he's in.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Anime Jam Session.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I got to meet Misty.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
And Hitstun found us.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000
And met some other people from the community.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000
It was a good time. I didn't get to see Havoc978.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I didn't go to the Bring Your Own Computer area all that often, so that's kind of where he hangs out.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:45.000
But comparing PAX East to PAX Prime, I can see why they're saying that PAX East is the real PAX.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Just because that convention center is huge.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000
I don't know if the one you went to was in this convention center.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:56.000
No, I went to the very first one that was at that other convention center downtown that I don't think they have it at anymore.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:59.000
It's the same one that Anime Boston, I think, is at.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:04.000
I think, yeah, it's the Boston Convention Center, which is really close to the airport, which is great.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Because I'm so used to, like, in Los Angeles and Seattle, it's like a 40-minute cab ride to get from the airport to the convention center.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
In this one, it's like, you know, 10 bucks.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Well, the problem is LA is gigantic, and then the Seattle airport is actually Seattle-Tacoma.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
So it's in between the two.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
We had that nice limo ride.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Yeah, that was the first limo ride I ever took in my life was when we went to Penny Arcade Expo from the airport there.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Because we were like, we're rock stars, we're taking a limo.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Actually, when we did the DDR Freak moderator trip, they sprung for us to get limos from the...

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Must be nice.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
It was fun in Las Vegas.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Didn't you get to ride the limos for the Windows 7, the Microsoft Windows thing?

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
That was the second, that was after that PAX.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Okay, that was the E3, yeah.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000
And that video we made that never got put on the internet, but whatever.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Yeah, they stopped at the one that me and Glenn did.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
That was the one they stopped at.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.000
And they're like, we can send you the raw assets if you want to cut something together.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
And we're like, no, that's not why we did it.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:14.000
So the thing that's kind of funny is because I did a podcast with the Boston Bastard Brigade and Electric Sistahood,

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:21.000
and there was a whole bunch of other podcasters, and we did a podcast that's going to be coming out this week sometime.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000
We recorded it this morning at 10 AM.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000
It was actually a lot of fun being in there.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
It was a round table type podcast.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:33.000
But what struck me as interesting, and they had to cut off the end of the podcast because they were losing that room,

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000
was that they were treating this a lot like E3.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.000
And they're like, what do you think of PAX? What games did you play on the show floor?

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.000
And I couldn't get in that I'm like, I think they missed the point of PAX.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.000
I mean, the show floor is a big part of it, but PAX is so much bigger than that.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:55.000
And some of the stuff that I saw at PAX that really blew me away was not on the show floor.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:01.000
I walked in, and this just hit my nostalgia bone. Two things hit my nostalgia bone.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I walked into one room. It's really dark.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:10.000
And all it had in there, and I'm not kidding, 16 fully functional steel battalions.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
That sounds awesome.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Eight of them were system link with the multiplayer game, and then they had four playing the single player.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
That sounds like my house, except I have two.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Sixteen, all fully functional, and they had the one enforcer who knew everything about the game,

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:32.000
and he was yelling at people kind of military style and giving them, kind of like the old,

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.000
kind of like the spiel that you would get from Mecor if you're doing the battle tech pods and stuff.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
So that was really neat. And then they had the classic console room.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000
And they actually did, in the corner, have like a Commodore 64 with a five and a quarter inch disk drive.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:51.000
That you could load in, and they had the Apple IIe with the disks.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:58.000
And just going through there, and that and MagFest, the music and game convention,

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:04.000
they had a room, and it was jam sessions, and Megaran performed in there outside of the normal concerts,

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:09.000
like the big name concerts. They had the smaller, lesser known bands actually perform in this room,

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:16.000
and it was all day. And that's what sets PAX apart from E3, even though if you listen to most podcasts,

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000
they're going to concentrate on the E3 aspects of PAX.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:27.000
But what about that show floor? Because there were some games that showed up that we hadn't heard of yet,

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:34.000
like Hearthstone, and we talked earlier in the show about Saints Row IV, and the DuckTales game from Capcom.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Okay, let me start here, okay? Because we rag on Capcom, right?

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Right, of course.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:46.000
We mess everything up. I mean, I thought that I had played the worst demo in the world, Ni No Kuni.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:52.000
And then Capcom comes along and Capcom's the demo. Because Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate,

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.000
the worst demo I have ever played. Ni No Kuni is no longer the worst demo I've ever played.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Yeah, no, I actually mentioned, you were surprised on the plane we were doing Gaming Week,

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.000
but I actually mentioned you and that whole thing in Gaming Week, because I hated the demo as well.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.000
But I have friends that love Monster Hunter, and I'm like, I wouldn't know that from this demo.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:17.000
And so, yeah, I think I landed, and we were on the Classic Game of the Week when I got in my car from the airport.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Anyway, I'll catch the podcast. So, I learned, okay, they're doing DuckTales, and I'm like, they can't mess this up.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:33.000
How can Capcom mess this up? I just, I just, you can't, I mean, it was perfect, and stuff.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
You want to know how Capcom messed this up?

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
They let the Pink Palace developers do it.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
No, no, no, here's how they messed it up at PAX.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.000
How?

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.000
There's only one copy of the game in the entire city of Boston.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:51.000
One copy on one single kiosk. It's a seven-minute demo.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:58.000
The line went around the corner of the booth, and they had to cap it because it was already four hours long.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.000
To play the seven-minute demo. It was the only copy they had.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.000
They did not have any other copies for press to go behind the scenes.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.000
They do a GDC. They're going to be shown at a GDC behind the scenes to people who are going to be there.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.000
But that was the only copy they had, and, see, here's the thing that a lot of people probably don't realize,

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
is that Capcom in that panel announced two games.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:24.000
They announced DuckTales, and they announced this remake of the old Dungeons & Dragons four-player arcade game.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:29.000
And so their idea was they were going to have those two games just next, side by side, next to each other.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Nobody's playing the Dungeons & Dragons game.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Oh, that's sad.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I know, that game is absolutely awesome.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
To be fair, though, news about that one had leaked last week.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Because I remember talking about it on last week's show.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
We already kind of knew that was coming.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
But the DuckTales one was a complete surprise.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:47.000
And so I was up there, and I asked the lady from Capcom,

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
I'm like, so, why do you only have one kiosk of this, that?

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
And she shot me this look.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Like, oh my god, I wish you had not asked that question.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.000
And this is like an hour after they had unveiled that side of the booth.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
It was covered up until the panel.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.000
And so I, in order to save her, I was like, is that the million dollar question?

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000
She's like, that's the five million dollar question.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:13.000
So they are, they knew, like I think when everybody started singing in that panel,

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.000
I think they realized they messed up only bringing one copy of the game.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.000
I think it's because it's running on dev kits, and they only have minimum amounts of dev kits.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:27.000
That's exactly my thought, because remember, GDC is happening literally, what, tomorrow or Tuesday?

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Starts Tuesday.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Yeah, when GDC starts, all the dev kits are probably in San Francisco.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
They can't be in two places at once.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
No, Rob, Passover starts tomorrow.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Anyway.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.000
But what they could have done is since nobody's touching that stupid Dungeons and Dragons game,

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.000
make that DuckTales!

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.000
That's not stupid!

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Put on the last stage, you know, cover up the Dungeons and Dragons with like a really,

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:52.000
you know, crude notebook paper and Sharpie saying DuckTales.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
And just do that.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:57.000
And then that four hour wait would have been a two hour wait.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
I'm gonna get the one dude to come by.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Where's Dungeons and Dragons?

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I heard there was a Dungeons and Dragons game, I wanna play it.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Dude, okay, the Dungeons and Dragons game is awesome, and I probably would have played that

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.000
if everyone else was over DuckTales.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Yeah, you could have walked right up to play that one.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000
But then there's the long line of everybody trying to watch DuckTales.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:20.000
And what does it say about, I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000
so this is an open question, what does this say about PAX in terms of game announcements,

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.000
considering this was not the only game announced there, that the most excited people got

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.000
over an announcement at PAX was a remake of an NES game?

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000
It's one that's near and dear to everybody's hearts, though.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I mean, you go great NES games, and people remember, DuckTales is on a lot of lists.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
So, I mean, I can kind of see it.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000
And it does look great.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
I hope it delivers.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:57.000
But aside from that, the best part about PAX is that they embrace the indie culture.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:02.000
And the indie games. And the indie games take up pretty much half the show floor, is all indie games.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Probably even more so than your AAA titles.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Because you gotta realize Activision wasn't there, Sony really wasn't there that much,

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000
they had The Last of Us, and that was about it.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:17.000
But indie games, like just all these crazy ideas, I actually played on an Ouya.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Oh my gosh, they exist!

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.000
It exists, the controller is terrible.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Aw, Quincy!

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:28.000
It's unresponsive, but I actually played a game that actually makes use of that touchpad

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.000
in a way that makes sense.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000
In the same touchpad that's gonna be on the Playstation 4, the game I played there is a Saturday morning RPG.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:41.000
It's an 8-bit, kind of, turn-based RPG, but with a lot of, like, some of the minigames in there,

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:44.000
you're playing Simon, and stuff like that.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.000
It's about, like, basically Saturday morning cartoons or this kid's real life.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.000
But right before each battle, you scratch off stickers.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000
And that's what you use the touchpad for.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:58.000
By scratching, you act like you're scratching off a sticker.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.000
So, it was a neat game, and it's actually a launch title for the Ouya, so I played that a little bit.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.000
And the buttons on the Ouya controller, it's O-U-Y-A.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Of course.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.000
And so it's like, press O to do this, so I press what winds up being the A button on the controller,

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:15.000
because that's the circle button on the Playstation controller.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
It's gonna take some getting used to.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.000
And even the developer said, I don't like the button placement.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Like, I don't like the way they did that.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Like, you know, they should have been some kind of standard or something.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000
But I did play that.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000
But there were some other neat things that I saw that I wasn't able to get interviews with.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:35.000
There's, for the hardcore of the hardcore, I'm talking, like, I don't know if Dungeon Buster's in chat,

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
because, like, this is up his alley.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
He is in chat.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Okay, he is in chat.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Dungeon Buster, this is straight up your alley.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
The game's called Artemis.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:50.000
And this is a spacecraft simulator, in the sense like the old Star Trek.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
So imagine the Enterprise.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Except it's multiplayer across PC, iPad, iPhone, I think even Android.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000
And you are basically a crew member.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:04.000
And so what they had set up, they had them on laptops there.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
And they had five stations.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:13.000
You have your captain, your science officer, your engineering officer, your navigation, and your weapons guy.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
And you're all cross-talking.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.000
You have your screen.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.000
And the way they had it set up there is you had your screen that had, like, a radar and things you could do.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Then they had a main screen that actually had the 3D render of what it was doing.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000
And they were all talking to each other.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Okay, you know, turn the ship to 160 degrees.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
You know, get close.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Okay, comm officer, request docking.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Comm officer will say, okay, you know, we've got permission to dock.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.000
And then the navigation perk guy would actually dock with the station.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
And then, you know, battle stuff.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
They would look at, you know, okay, when do I turn on the shields?

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
And the captain would start yelling out orders.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:49.000
And it's this social game where basically all of you are working together to fly the spaceship,

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.000
have space battles, and I guess deliver cargo and stuff.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:57.000
It was amazingly interesting.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.000
I didn't get a chance to play it because it was a 20-minute demo.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
So it was kind of hard to get in on it.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
But that's actually out now.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:09.000
And here's the thing about Artemis, is that they don't like DRM.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:16.000
And so what you can do is when you buy the game, you're actually buying a license to the ship.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.000
So basically you buy that one ship, and they don't check for this.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
So this is honor system.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:27.000
But then you can send the game to five of your buddies as long as they're all flying on your ship.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.000
So only one person has to buy the game for five people to fly the ship and play the game.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000
That's pretty cool.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.000
It's kind of like a DS title where everybody can download from the one person.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000
I don't know, kind of.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
That's kind of what I'm thinking of when you say that.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.000
That's really cool.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
So that was one of the games that I saw.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Another game that a lot of people were probably talking about,

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
I don't know if you ever heard of this game called Divekick.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
I think so, yeah.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Divekick, this is the most complex fighting game ever.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000
And it's coming out for PlayStation 3 and Vita and stuff like that.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:02.000
And the way that they had it there was that they actually had an arcade-style controller.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:06.000
There are two buttons, dive and kick.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:09.000
And so you select your character, and there were five characters in the game.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:14.000
And one of them is kind of funny because the name of the character was Wolverine.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000
And so they got a cease and desist letter.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:21.000
So the name of that character is now redacted with a strike through it.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:25.000
So basically in Divekick, it's the standard thing.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:29.000
And you have the little guy go, okay, ready? Divekick!

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:34.000
And then you can jump with the dive button and then kick with the kick button.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Or if you just hit the kick button, you dive.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:40.000
And it's basically whoever hits the other person first, it's a one-shot kill.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Even though it shows all these health bars at the stop, but it's a one-hit thing.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:46.000
And you're basically just jumping and diving, and that's all you're doing.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:52.000
And it is the most hilarious, funny fighting game I've ever played.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:56.000
So it sounds like you saw a lot of gems, really, like these little indie gems.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
I did not see a bad game.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.000
That's good.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I did not see a bad game. Even in the card game, board game section, I did not see a bad game.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Because the area was probably just as big as the video game section,

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:13.000
but they had the whole tabletop section, and the entire perimeter of the tabletop section

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:19.000
were vendors and people showing off tabletop board games, card games, things like that.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.000
And that was in there, and that's where I actually played a game that I actually did buy,

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:28.000
a card game called Flame War, which triggered my PTSD of the G4 forums thing.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Because you're playing as a forum moderator, trying to create forum threads and then closing them,

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
but the way that you attack other players, you flame on their threads.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.000
And all the cards have internet memes on them.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Awesome.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.000
And so I did buy it, and one of the cards is the ban hammer.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:49.000
And so people that were around in the G4 days, they actually were selling a shirt of the ban hammer,

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.000
which was basically a hammer that said ban in it, and yes, I did buy that shirt.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Of course, you have to.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:58.000
I have the ban hammer shirt, so anybody that remembers me from the G4 days will appreciate that.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
That is amazing.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Obviously, you say PAX is a lot more than just the expo floor, the community and all that.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:10.000
I saw some pictures on Facebook.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.000
It looks like you guys were up very late playing Cards Against Humanity.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Yes, and that was pretty much like...

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.000
At Dragon Con, I'm used to seeing people in a circle playing Are You a Werewolf?

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.000
And here, everybody was playing Cards Against Humanity.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Because they released the third expansion, which sold out on Saturday.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:33.000
But they also had these three PAX East exclusive packs that you could get.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
If you found them, you got them.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.000
And they were either in the swag bag or if you went to the Kickstarter room, you could get it from them.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
And they were handing them out.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Cards Against Humanity was huge at PAX.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.000
A lot of people were playing that everywhere that you looked.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.000
I think that game took off.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.000
I think that's a Kickstarter success story right there.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Probably Streetpassed with about 11 billion people.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Yes, I would have Streetpassed with more if I kept at it, but I wound up filling all my pieces and completing Find Me.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000
But I now have, I think, over 1,000 Streetpasses total.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.000
And that's from all the E3 and all the other stuff that I've done with it.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.000
I'm only up to 500 and I thought I had a ton from...

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Well, you see, I thought I had a ton too.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000
And then I was sitting next to somebody when I went into the Rock Band panel.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Which is the only panel I went to, which was the behind the scenes.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:28.000
They named names and everything. It was awesome. It's never going to be broadcast.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.000
But I was sitting there and he had like 2,800.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:35.000
And I remarked on it and he just looked at me and was like, I'm a cast member at Disney World.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:44.000
And so the Rock Band panel was, you're never going to see it broadcast.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Because they actually spent about 10 minutes saying, we could get in so much trouble if you...

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:52.000
And they're looking right at the IGN and the Polygon guys in the front row with their laptops out.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.000
And they kept looking and they're like, don't write this. Please don't write this.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Because they actually were naming names.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:03.000
And talking about, here's where we fucked up, is basically what it was.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:08.000
And they went through, hey, we announced Rock Band Japan. Yeah, let's tell you what happened with that.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000
And they were showing video, like concept video of Rock Band Japan.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:17.000
And basically Rock Band Japan died because Japanese licensing is worse than American music licensing.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
And people in Japan have small rooms.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:26.000
But they also talked about Pearl Jam Rock Band, which actually was announced by Pearl Jam.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:33.000
But they actually showed concept video of that and how it was going to be about the Pearl Jam live experience.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Because Pearl Jam is a very active bootlegging culture and live video.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
So they were actually putting it around their...

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.000
And the video in the background was actually going to be video footage from a lot of these concerts.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Iconic Pearl Jam concerts.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.000
And it just, for whatever reason, it didn't work out.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.000
And they then coughed and said, any better.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.000
But then they talked about, yes, we know you want Muse.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:01.000
And they basically kind of explained how something happened and that's why they don't have Muse.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:08.000
They actually talked about Pink Floyd and actually how they made concept video of doing Dreamscape type of stuff with Pink Floyd tracks.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:11.000
The Beatles Pink style stuff.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:16.000
And they actually had concept art that they sent off to Pink Floyd and it just never happened.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Same, Led Zeppelin also had a little bit of that.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
They had some stuff like that.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
And then they talked about the Guns N' Roses debacle.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:29.000
And just kind of the highlight of this was where apparently there was a leaked video that came out.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:35.000
A viral video that went out of an unnamed harmonics employee, which everybody tried to name.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Saying, hey, we got the entire Guns N' Roses library, Appetite for Destruction, everything.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
And we're going to do this and this and this and this.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
And it was a hoax.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
It was a hoax video, but it was an extremely believable hoax.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:50.000
And it turns out it was by somebody who at the time was just a dumb kid.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Now he's in the game industry and they're like, should we name him?

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Yeah, we're going to name him.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Dan Rickert, who was like one of the head guys at Game Informer now.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Is the person who actually made that video and made harmonics life a living hell.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Oh my gosh.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.000
For several months.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Wow.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.000
So, but of course no news on the future.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:14.000
I mean, I know we got the news about American Pie being the last DLC song.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000
That's the big song.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
But nothing about the future, of course, right?

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.000
No, but I did get to, because I do know both Nick Chester and John Drake.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000
And I was up to see both of them during the show.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:28.000
And I didn't ask them what they were working on because I knew they couldn't tell me about that.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
And I asked them, will I think it's cool?

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.000
And I told them, hey, I've been with you guys since frequency days.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.000
And John looked at me and he's like, you will find this cool.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
You will find what we're doing cool.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.000
We're going to announce it.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
We're hoping to announce it at E3.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.000
He's like 95% sure.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
He doesn't want to say anything more than that.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:49.000
But I told him, yeah, I was with you in the frequency and amplitude days and all that stuff.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
And he's like, it's not rock band.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:56.000
But considering what I like of Harmonics' past, he says, I will think that what they're coming up with is cool.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
And he's very excited about it.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
And that's all I could get out of him.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Well, Bobby, it sure sounds like we missed a heck of a show.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
I'm sad, but it is what it is.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.000
But anything else about PAX East you want to share with us?

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I got a whole ton of interviews.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:17.000
I am going to be probably putting them out on my podcast, or some of them on my podcast feed.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Because if I did one a week, every week, they would go until June.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Tell us more about Saints Row IV.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Well, I did see Saints Row IV.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000
And I'm going to break this news.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
I told Rob about this.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Because now Deep Silver is handling Saints Row IV.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:39.000
I have a very good relationship with Deep Silver.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:44.000
So, you know, THQ never gave me the time of day, but Deep Silver did.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:50.000
And they were showing Saints Row IV to the press in the hotel that's connected to the convention center.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Instead of having to wait in line.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:56.000
And also that way they weren't bumping people out of the line, bumping attendees.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
They had press in a different area.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.000
And so I went in there, and it's the same video.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.000
The same ten minute video that they were showing everybody else.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.000
And they had developers in there, and they're like, yeah, interviews and stuff.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
You know, do interviews.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000
So I went up to our PR contact.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Her name is Stephanie Shop.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
She is amazing.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.000
And I went up, and Stephanie Shop also, if you listen to my show,

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:20.000
she was responsible for getting the MechWarrior online, and the Devolver Digital,

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.000
and all those interviews, the ones I did kind of in November.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.000
She was responsible for setting all those up.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.000
And I was like, hey, you know, so can I get an interview with one of the Saints Row guys?

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:31.000
The developers.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.000
And she looked at me and said, no, you can't.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
And I'm like, okay.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:40.000
And she's like, because I'd rather you do one of your long form Skype interviews

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
in a couple weeks with them.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Nice. Very nice.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Because it would be a five to ten minute quickie interview there,

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:53.000
and she's like, I'd rather you do one of your long form ones with these guys.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
So you don't have a date yet, though, right?

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
No date.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Well, because she's heading off to GDC.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I'm not bugging her until after GDC.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Sure, sure.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:06.000
But she said she does want to do it in the next couple weeks, so it could be pretty soon.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Awesome.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Well, it sounds like you made a lot of great connections at PAX East.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
You had a really good time, making us all jealous we didn't go.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.000
But hey, there's Dragon Con and E3, hopefully.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.000
You're going to have a great time at Dragon Con.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
We are going to have a great time at Dragon Con.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000
No, I'm seriously looking forward to it.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
It's going to be great.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.000
And yeah, I mean, I probably do have more stories.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:31.000
I saw a lot of other great indie games, some that weren't even on the show floor that I got to see.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:35.000
And those interviews are going to be airing throughout the next couple weeks,

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:38.000
and we're going to be getting some review copies of those.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:44.000
And it's a good time to be a gamer. Shut up with the hate.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Of all the stuff I did, I did not see a single bad game, even looking through all the indie stuff.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:54.000
I did not see a single bad game.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Transistor. I think that's the Supergiant games from Bastion.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
If you want to know what my game of show is.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:04.000
That?

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.000
That's it.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Interesting.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
That was the last thing I played.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:12.000
That was the last thing I did before going to the airport was I got to play that game.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.000
And it is Bastion in the future with...

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:21.000
It's different enough from Bastion, but you can tell that it's a love of Bastion.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Logan Cunningham comes back to do the voice, but he's doing a little bit different voice,

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:27.000
and instead of being the narrator, he's actually the voice of your sword.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:30.000
That's how they work the narration into it.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
So your sword's constantly talking to you.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:37.000
And it's not narration, the sword's actually giving you direction and advice.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:42.000
And you can stop time and queue up actions, and it's all badass and everything.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:45.000
That probably is my game of show.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:49.000
SSG100Matt says his girlfriend agrees with you. Transistor's the game of the show.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Didn't the talking sword thing happen in a Mercedes Lackey novel?

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:55.000
I think it's distant enough that it's alright.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:56.000
It actually did.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
I think it's distant enough that it's alright.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:01.000
Well, Bobby, I know you're going to have plenty to say on the next episode of your show.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I can't imagine there's a person listening to this that doesn't know about your show,

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:07.000
but just in case, please plug away.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:12.000
I am the opening band, not the band that you came to see.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:16.000
But I'll only be here for five or six songs, and then I'll go away.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:22.000
An hour before O.O.R., 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific on Sunday nights.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Usually it's me doing a monologue for 30 minutes, taking calls from Break Man for another 20 minutes,

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
and then talking to you guys for 10 minutes.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:34.000
And that's my show, and we've got a lot of great interviews coming up.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:41.000
A game book being put into iPad, an old-style 80s game book, Steve Jackson's Sorcery.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:45.000
It plays like an Infocom text adventure as well, but looks really great.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
We're going to talk to them.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:53.000
An iPad brawler that does not use virtual controls, and it plays more like Fruit Ninja,

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
and it actually does work.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:59.000
I do get to talk to Phoenix Online Studios with Cognition and the silver lining

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:02.000
in the next game that they're doing with Jane Jensen.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:07.000
I got to talk to Mommy's Best Games about guns on top of guns and on top of guns.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Nathan Fouts, he's also been on Fox News a lot recently,

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:13.000
and we talk about why that happened and what he thinks of that.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:19.000
So there's a lot of great content that I've got in my suitcase that is still locked up

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
and sitting in the hallway because I ran in here.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
All right, Bobby, go unpack.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
We're going to let you go so we can get a couple more calls,

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
but thanks so much for spending some time with us tonight.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:31.000
No problem, and remember, if Legend of Zaku calls in and he's all like,

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
That's not him.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
It's really a funny guy.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
It's an act.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
It's an act.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:43.000
All right, Bobby Black Wolf Show calling out the OLR regulars tonight.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
All right, have a good one, Bobby.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Take care.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Take care. Bye.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
The one and only Bobby Black Wolf, everybody.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:53.000
We let him go a little long tonight, but you know what?

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I'm excited to hear from some people that were at PAX East.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.000
He always has us on our show, or he always has us on his show.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.000
It's the least we can do, and he has a lot of great info from the floor.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I'm hoping we'll get some more PAX East-related calls,

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
like maybe this next one that's coming in right now.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Hey, it's Legend of Zaku here.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Well, were your ears burning?

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Because someone was just talking about you.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Yeah, I heard it in the car right over.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:24.000
I heard it right as the car was pulling up to my house.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
So, Zaku, is it all an act?

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Is this all an act?

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Maybe, but not like sidebar and focus on the real task at hand,

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
which was PAX East.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:42.000
All right, well, let's talk about the real reason why you called tonight.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:45.000
PAX East, so you were obviously at the show, too, because you met Bobby.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:46.000
How was it?

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
I was rooming with him, actually.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Were you really? Awesome.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:54.000
But then it got shifted when we got into the other hotel.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:00.000
I'm not going to say as to the reasons why, but he knows it very well,

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
and we'll leave it at that.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Long story short, this PAX, the way I put it, it was average.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Last year's PAX, amongst all the swag and the parties, it doesn't hold a candle.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Case in point, Curse's PAX East party this year wasn't even open bar,

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000
and they oversold it to the point where you only had one free drink,

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:33.000
and then everything else you had to pay at the cash bar.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:39.000
The economy is really sons of bitches close to the open bar.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
That's why I came to this thing.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
You know what, though? Perfectly legit.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.000
PAX East, not as good, because they closed the open bar this year.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Fuck them.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:55.000
That is true, and then it was surprising,

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:59.000
aside from trying my best to play some of these things,

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000
given the fact that there were lines just about everywhere,

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:05.000
so I only got to play very few things.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000
I was able to get Hawken to play that game.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:17.000
I also tried out the Nvidia Shield, the new handheld controller device that they have,

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:21.000
which is kind of nifty, though, because it's using the latest version of Android.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:25.000
The latest one that you see on the Nexus 4 and the latest tablets,

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
that's exactly the one they're running.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:35.000
It really feels like a top-tier device.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
I'm not just bullshitting or anything.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:40.000
I'm just saying it also has touchscreen,

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:50.000
but it feels like you're actually playing a recent, current-gen console.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.000
And the graphics are on par.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:59.000
They're like 360 graphics from launch titles.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:09.000
It's gotten to the point where mobile's pretty much at or tailing right now the big-boy consoles.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:13.000
You talked about a lot of these lines for games.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Did you wait in any of them?

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Did you stand in that epic line to play DuckTales?

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
No, that's the thing.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:26.000
I was just going around the con, around the expo hall.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.000
I did my best to try to score as much free swag as possible,

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
but yeah, it was slim pickings this year.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:32.000
You're a fan of free stuff.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:35.000
I wouldn't be able to guess from your talk about the Curse party.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:41.000
What fun nightlife did these Paxis have? Anything?

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:49.000
I mean, most of the nightlife was either you went to the local bars near the hotels,

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:52.000
which was like the day before the con,

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:57.000
which was a pub crawl that basically stayed in one place because it took too long.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:01.000
But other than that, it was just like whatever you had in your room,

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
if you had Cards Against Humanity,

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:07.000
you were basically playing not only with your roommates,

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:12.000
but with random strangers that would just bring bottles of high-end liquor,

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:17.000
like Johnny Walker, like a leader Johnny Walker for that table.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:20.000
And I was like, we're taking big swigs of it.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.000
And as a result, I had to nurse a hangover this morning.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
I was just about to ask, I was going to say,

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:30.000
your eyes are looking a little bit like you haven't slept in about four days.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.000
No, it's like I puked this morning.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Yeah.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000
I was going to say you have that sort of Prize Fighter look about you.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Like I wasn't going to say he got in a fight,

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:45.000
but he definitely has that whole like, I had a hell of a weekend,

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:46.000
don't you ask me?

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
My face was just crunching up, tightening up,

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:52.000
because I was lurching over the toilet trying to puke.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Were you offering your sacrifices to the porcelain goddess?

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Porcelain goddess, yes.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Sacrificing my dignity.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:06.000
But aside from the newer games that were out

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.000
and the fact that they were just like, you know,

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
aside from the lines and everything else,

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.000
board games were pretty much another huge aspect of it.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:21.000
It got to the point where I actually have gotten my girlfriend.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:25.000
I know, well, for those who probably can't see the camera, but...

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
That's our weekend.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Spartacus board game.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Is that based on the TV show?

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Yes.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
How much full frontal is in the board game?

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Huh?

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
How much full frontal is in the board game?

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:40.000
None.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.000
My girlfriend would be disappointed, yeah.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
That's all she watches it for, full frontal,

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:51.000
and then her dad watches along with her for the boobs.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.000
That's kind of awkward, but all right.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Yeah, I mean, everywhere, like, yeah, board games,

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000
like, it got to the point where it was like,

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.000
at this point, it's like a good third board games,

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.000
another third indie, or more importantly,

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:14.000
probably like a quarter indie, and then everything else.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000
All right, let me ask...

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
I'm still waiting for Mass Effect Risk.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Let me ask you one more question, Zaku.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Since you say you weren't as big on PAX East this year

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
as you were, like, last year,

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.000
what can PAX 2014 learn from this year?

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:30.000
How can PAX East 2014 set up to be the most kick-ass one yet,

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
besides open bars?

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:39.000
All right, I guess it's the panels that I tried my best

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
to actually go to.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Like, this year I did better than the fact that I did,

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:47.000
like, one, two, three, four...

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
I think I did, like, six panels,

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
one of which I had to duck out because of my hangover,

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.000
but, yeah, it's gotten better.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
The content has gotten a lot better.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Obviously, it still packs up pretty badly.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Like, obviously, the Bioshock panel fills up rather quickly.

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Of course.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:08.000
But it's just like trying to...

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.000
I guess they can't please everybody.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:14.000
So the best they could do is stay where they are

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
because they have...

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Their venue can handle whatever crowd size

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:21.000
they're throwing in.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
I wouldn't be surprised if next year

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
it'll be almost, like, 100 grand, 100,000 attendees.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Oh, my gosh.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
But then, yeah, that's gonna, like, you're...

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:33.000
It's gonna get to the point where people are just gonna get in the way

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:37.000
and then it's gonna be massive line waiting for, like, you know,

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
for stuff like Watch Dogs,

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
which I heard was a major disappointment over there,

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:46.000
which was showing, like, clips and rehash footage that was already out.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Oh, that's gotta be irritating.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000
You're waiting a big old long line

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:52.000
and then it's just some damn movie you already saw on the internet.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Square Enix Theater.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Yeah, right.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:59.000
The only cool thing about PAX this year was

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
the classic gaming had...

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Well, aside from having the standard setup,

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.000
like, one room dedicated to just classic gaming of consoles,

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:08.000
they had another one.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
They had a featured room.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000
And this year's feature was Steel Battalion.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Like, they had 12 of these.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Just playing Steel Battalion is not even fun.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.000
It's just work.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Start up the next computer.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Do systems check.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Next time it needs to come with some vodka.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:30.000
It'll be a whole lot better.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Alright.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls,

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
but thanks so much for the report,

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.000
and I'm glad to hear at least you had a decent enough times

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
that you were regretting it this morning.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Yeah.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Also, they were giving away free Android Bluetooth controllers.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Nice.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:48.000
For Android-owned users.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.000
Yeah.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Where's mine?

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.000
Alright.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Alright, Zaku.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:53.000
Gotta let you go, buddy.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Take care.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Okay.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Bye.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Props to Zaku, an OLR gold store.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:58.000
A gold store?

02:41:58.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Well, he can have a whole store.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:02.000
A gold star for Zaku for doing a video call

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
so we can actually see the Spartacus game that he bought.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Good times.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Alright, we'll see if anybody else wants to call.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Making us all jealous we weren't there.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:15.000
You alright?

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
I just saw something terrifying.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:18.000
What's that?

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
A goblin shark.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000
That does sound terrifying.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
They have retractable jaws.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Much less terrifying this next phone call.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Hi.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Hello, Olarians.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Hello, what's up?

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Hi.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Who's this?

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:33.000
It's CatastrophicMoggie.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Hello.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Nice to meet you.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:36.000
And we even...

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.000
I thought I'd never get through.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000
You never get through.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Wow.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:40.000
Yay.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Wait.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Hold on.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:47.000
The clock on the wall behind you, 3.52 in the morning?

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Yes.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Oh my.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:50.000
You told me it was going to stay up for us.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Wow.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Yeah, I did say to that was Kara I would.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.000
We usually do our chatting when it's four in the morning for me.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
And here you are.

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Well, what's up?

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:04.000
I was going to complain about region locking

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:10.000
and how I'm so unexcited by the current news about consoles.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000
But I thought you've already had so much time.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
I thought I'd bring up something from weeks ago.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Sure.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Go for it.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:20.000
The last...

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Oh, pardon me.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Sorry.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
I'm completely fumbling over my words now.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:25.000
That's all right.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:26.000
I do it all the time.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:27.000
It's true.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:28.000
He does.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Yeah.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:30.000
We have to listen to three hours of it.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Hey.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
I get to make fun of me.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Me.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:43.000
Weeks ago, you were talking, I can't remember what it was about, about your other halves

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
guesting on OLR.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Was it?

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:49.000
And I thought, your last episode.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Go on.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Go on.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Go.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:55.000
After your last episode, you should...

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Okay.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.000
He's on.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.000
He's on.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.000
He's on.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.000
He's on.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Okay.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
He's on the internet.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Yes.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Where is it?

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:07.000
It's Fourn and Horning.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Shh.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Quiet.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:12.000
For your last episode, you should have...

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Or for your E3 special, you should have the other half special with Alan, Dan, and...

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Nelly.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Nelly.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Pardon.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:26.000
Or and with your mum being a guest co-spond.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:27.000
That would be hilarious.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.000
We've talked about him before, and I'm sure Dan and Alan would be down.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:35.000
It would just be about convincing Nelly that it's a really funny idea, but that might be

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:36.000
difficult.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Nelly would probably punch my husband.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:41.000
And then I'd have to be here to see that.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
You'd have to video it.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Yes.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:45.000
It would have to be a video thing.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:46.000
I don't know.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Maybe the only way I could see that happening is if we promised Nelly it was the last episode

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:56.000
of the show ever, because she'd be like, yay, Matt can have a life now.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Yeah, you should do it either for the last episode or an E3 special.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:03.000
We'll see.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.000
We'll see.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.000
It'd be like we couldn't be bothered to show up, so our spouses do it.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:11.000
So we've had a bunch of people calling in to talk about PAX East tonight.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Obviously, you're a little far away, so I'm imagining you didn't make it to PAX East,

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:17.000
but what do you think about everything you're hearing?

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Honestly, I've not heard much news from PAX East.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Most of what I've heard is from you.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.000
My biggest reaction is I wish DuckTales was coming to PC.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:29.000
Oh, yeah.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
They didn't announce it for PC, did they?

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:37.000
I have a policy of not getting digital content on consoles.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
I can see why.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.000
You know what, though?

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:45.000
One time when it won't transfer over, and at least with physical stuff you can trade

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:48.000
it in with digital stuff, you're stuck with it for now.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:54.000
If it does well enough, though, they'll put it on disk.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.000
If it's going to be on Xbox, though, it shouldn't be that hard to port it to PC.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Yeah.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:00.000
I hope so.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Anyway, I take up too much of your time, so I'll get off now.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:05.000
No worries.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:09.000
It's a pleasure to hear from you and to get to see you, and I know you've got to shut

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:12.000
up because people are trying to sleep, but thank you for breaking all the rules in your

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
household to call us tonight.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
I'm getting shouted at.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:17.000
Bye.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Bye.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Bye.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Bye.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Bye.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Bye.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Bye.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Bye.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Bye.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Bye.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Bye.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:28.000
We got someone in trouble.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:29.000
We got someone in trouble.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Alright.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:33.000
One eight seven seven game OLR, or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:36.000
That was a great call, though.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.000
It's true, though.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:41.000
I usually, because I'm up around like four in the morning, and usually that's right when

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:46.000
he's on, so we end up chatting about stuff.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Bobby and ActDeft in our chat room talking a little bit about the DuckTales on PC thing.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:55.000
ActDeft was convinced it was coming to PC, and BlackWolf says his sources say it's a

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
possibility eventually.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:58.000
Not at launch, though.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:04.000
I mean, after all, Resident Evil 6 I think just or is about to come out on Steam.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Sometimes PC's a little bit later, so just hold out.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Just hold out, guys.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:09.000
It might happen.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Who's this?

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Hey, hey, hey.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:15.000
It's Anime Jam Session calling live from the Mobile Jersey Mobile.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Holy crap.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.000
It's all you guys.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:18.000
I hope you're not driving.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:19.000
No, I'm driving.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Okay.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Okay.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:27.000
I was going to say, because if Ron shouldn't have been the one driving, we would have hung

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:28.000
up.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Just because you do not talk on your phone and drive.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:31.000
I do it all the time.

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Don't listen to me.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Yeah, and you're going to kill somebody, namely a turkey.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:35.000
No, I'm not.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:36.000
No, I'm not.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:37.000
What?

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:38.000
All right.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Enough of Dark Soccer's lecturing.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
You guys are coming back from PAX East.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Did you have a good time?

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Yes, yes, yes, and I would like to let you know that as Executive Vice Chair of VOGCON

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:56.000
East 2013, we went over attendance capacity with the special guest of Cards Against Humanity.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:03.000
We went to a total of 16 guests with special guest stars Johnny Walker Red.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Now, wait a minute.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000
We've had two other callers so far tonight from VOG at PAX East.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
You're the first one to mention this con.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
What exactly ended up happening?

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Hello?

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Are we losing them?

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:21.000
What was that?

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
We're kind of breaking in and out here.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:24.000
That's okay.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:25.000
We're breaking in and out here.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:28.000
What ended up happening at this VOGCON?

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Let's see.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Jovay Dea did Alcohol Bingo.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Zaku went game over because he drank not as much as everybody else.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:49.000
And we did game plus inception equals game-ception.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
You don't say?

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Yes.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Yeah, we were playing a dice game.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:01.000
The rules of the game were roll dice, make up rule, drink.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Those were the rules of the game.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Yes.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Patent pending.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:11.000
The name of the game is called game.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:18.000
How many minutes were you sober during PAX East?

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Too stupid.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
More or less, yeah.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:22.000
All right.

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:25.000
What did you guys see on the show floor that kicked ass?

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Did you see anything out there?

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Or even if it wasn't on the show floor, like in a side room or a panel or whatever,

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
what did you see that kicked ass?

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
DuckTales.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Did you actually wait in that hideous line to play it or did you just run up and-

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Hell no!

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:44.000
No, DuckTales is one of those games where I will be buying it regardless.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
You don't need a demo to sell you, huh?

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Nope.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:52.000
I will say this though.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Twitch TV was having a giveaway for the DuckTales poster.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:59.000
They wanted people to sing the DuckTales theme.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.000
So me, my brother, and Jove were there.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
I tried to get Jove to sing.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:05.000
Yeah, right.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:10.000
I went up there with my bro, and the camera was on us, and after we sang the song,

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
dude in the booth's like,

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
yeah, give the dude with the Vox shirt a poster,

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:17.000
because he actually sang the words.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Nice.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Way to- good job name checking the station too.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
It's always a good thing.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:24.000
We love-

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:25.000
Well, we got-

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Well, we got to thank Ukchon for that because of how big the VOG logo is on our shirts.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Mm-hmm.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Good job.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Well, I know you guys are on your way home, and you got to get there safe and everything,

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:43.000
but since you guys are going to be talking about this undoubtedly on Anime Jam Session this Tuesday,

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
what do we have to look forward to?

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:49.000
Our complete review, a whole lot of stuff.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
But before we go, a couple of things.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:55.000
Another game that's worth picking up is Lego City Undercover.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Really?

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Yes. Are you a fan of the Shawshank Redemption?

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Yes.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:08.000
The game has a lot of pop culture references, including a scene from the Shawshank Redemption.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:11.000
That's kind of random in a Lego game.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:12.000
It's a prison break.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Basically, you have to go undercover into a prison and talk to one of the characters.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
The character's name is Blue.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Okay, okay.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:27.000
And you come to pick, and he starts talking like Morgan Freeman.

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:33.000
And some of the stuff he says, I was kind of hearing it.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
I'm like, why do I know this?

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:38.000
And then he said something, and I'm like, Blue.

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:41.000
I'm like, aw, crap! It's Shawshank!

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
I love games that do that, though.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Actually, Shane was just showing me a screenshot earlier from the new Pokémon game that came out.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Earlier today, actually.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:54.000
And what was the line here in this?

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Hold on, I'm bringing it up right now.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:59.000
I want to do this justice, because it's a great reference.

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Especially if you're Grandpa from Hoard House.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:06.000
One of the characters saying, you can call me Swanna if you want.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Just don't call me maybe.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:13.000
That was bad.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:17.000
Just as bad as the Nvidia Shield Controller.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Oh, was that on the show floor?

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Yes, I played it. The controls were...

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
The controlling was weak.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:30.000
The outline for doing the directional cross was really bad.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:34.000
And the demo game was Sonic 4.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:39.000
And when the song would end, it would pause for a half second and replay the track again.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:40.000
I'm like, yeah, no.

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Oh, lord.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:45.000
You know, Bobby was not a big fan of the Ouya Controller.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Did you get to see that in comparison to the Nvidia one?

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Ah, I did not know the Ouya was on display.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:53.000
I did not know.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:56.000
There's not enough time to see everything at one PAX.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
It doesn't matter, I'll be getting in like a week.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Alright.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:01.000
Um, okay.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
I gotta let you know, guys, so we can go wrap up the show.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
But any other last thoughts on PAX?

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:13.000
Get your butts out here for 2014 so we can do VOGCON 2014.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:17.000
And unfortunately for ActDeaf, since he's a staffer, he does tech.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:21.000
He'll be staffing the con for all three days, so by the time he gets off a shift,

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
all the fun stuff's already happened.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Womp womp.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:30.000
Uh, you know, though, VOGCON 2013 is DragonCon,

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
and you got to Atlanta for one con this year,

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:35.000
so I expect you're gonna be able to make it twice.

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Well, look at it this way.

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:41.000
If I graduate from college and I get those marks and I land the job,

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:44.000
we'll be partying our fabulous little asses off.

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
Awesome. We can play game.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:49.000
Yes!

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
I challenge you to game.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:56.000
That's not a challenge. That's a fun thing to do.

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:59.000
And you have to do it in deep Russian voices.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Oh, okay.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:01.000
You know what, though?

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:04.000
It has to be better than what we did at Fonami,

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:08.000
which was just the one bottle of Malibu and us going all over the place looking for a soda.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
How about this for the tagline?

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:13.000
In Soviet Russia, game play you!

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:15.000
That was it.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:19.000
And Ookchan, if we're going to do that, Jovideh will be there with our kinky vodka.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
Oh my god, the kinky vodka was so good.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Alright, I'm getting drunk off this conversation.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Rama, I gotta let you go.

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Take care, you guys.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Big hug to all you guys at Anime Jam Session, Jovideh and whoever else might be with you.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Um, take care, guys, okay?

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:34.000
You got it. Thank you.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Bye!

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:37.000
Love it.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:40.000
Alright, guys, sadly it is time I shut down the Skype line.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
We have been taking Skype calls for about 40 minutes, you know.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:43.000
But most of it was Bobby.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
Well, yes, but, you know, with good reason.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:49.000
But we had a lot from Zaku and Magi and, you know, Rama as well, so.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
Appreciate everybody who called.

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
If you didn't get through tonight but you have something to say,

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:54.000
for the love of god, email us.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
Give Dark Sakura some work to do next week.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:05.000
In the meantime, some quick Twitter topics before I go for last minute stories.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:11.000
TigerClaw305 wants to remind us that XCOM Enemy Unknown was announced for iOS.

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
I forgot about this but I did hear about this.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.000
They're talking about they're going to be charging probably a little more money for it.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
It's not going to be a 99 cent game.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Think more along like the lines of a $15 game.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:26.000
But that would be in line with Squeenix pricing on iOS so it would make a lot of sense.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:31.000
But, yeah, they say it's going to be just like you're playing it on PC or any of those.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:35.000
I mean, XCOM makes sense to be on iPad.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:36.000
It would work.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
iPhone would be a little too tiny.

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:39.000
I don't know about that one.

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
Even iPad Mini might be a little much.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:42.000
I don't know.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Dartusuya wanted to follow up on the rapid fire news.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:52.000
If you bought La Mulana on Playism or Desura, you will get a Steam key after April 15th.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:55.000
So some of you already are going to own this new La Mulana.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:00.000
Also, for next week, since we're so close to 500 and with all the old school talk,

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:03.000
can we air Best Hits Part 1 next week?

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Maybe.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:06.000
We'll see.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:07.000
I don't want to promise anything yet.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
You never know what we might come up with.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:15.000
And ActDeft also posted a story about Dust and Elysian Tail that was covered in our rapid fire news earlier.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Must have been in the restroom when we went over that.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:22.000
But I will say this story does say that a sequel may be in the works.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:23.000
Which, you know, game does well.

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:24.000
Sequel comes out.

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
That's no big surprise there.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:30.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us there and tweet us for a future week.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Last minute stories tonight.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Loki.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:34.000
This is kind of cool.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:41.000
They have put together this project called The Unleashed Project.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:47.000
And what it is is a total conversion for Sonic Generations that's Sonic Unleashed.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Sonic Unleashed has been ported to PC completely.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
And it runs better than it did on console.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:55.000
Nice.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:59.000
Because they're using the Generations engine.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:08.000
And Unleashed, I'm talking about all the actual non-werewolf, werehog levels.

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.000
We're talking about all the good levels.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:12.000
All the good ones.

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:13.000
Nice.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:16.000
Alright, that's it?

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:17.000
Yeah, that's it.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Alright, that's it.

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:21.000
Well, that's going to wrap us up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
This episode's going to have to suit you for two weeks.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:29.000
But, you know, we've got an archive of about 497 episodes before this one.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:32.000
So, if you need something to hold you over next week, go back and grab it.

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:39.000
All the podcasts are still on our server back through about 320.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
So, there's plenty that are on the feed to grab.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:45.000
If you need something before that, hit up Dark Tetsuya who's in our chat room.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:51.000
He's got the link to the O-L archive where they dug up fucking episodes of Vanilla Sky.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
And Guys on a Show.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:56.000
They probably have your music show you used to do.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Somebody probably recorded that.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Which was all like, if I had to go out and run errands, I'd just put on Eddie Izzard.

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:07.000
People used to bootleg the shit out of Orange Lounge Radio, the station.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Now, all this time later, it's awesome that they did that, really.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:15.000
I am also planning this Wednesday to be in Turntable.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Ah, I miss Turntable. Good times.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Doing, basically, what I used to do on my Pump of the Volume.

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
That's awesome. I miss Turntable. I always forget there.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Should we pop in there with me, Rob?

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
I very well might. Just let me know what night.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
As long as it isn't when, what's the night?

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:31.000
It's still Wednesday.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:32.000
Oh, Wednesday is Hoard House.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:33.000
I'm doing it after Hoard House.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Okay, after Hoard House is fine.

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:38.000
This week is actually, I need to give this a shout out, Hoard House episode 100 is this Wednesday.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:39.000
Nice.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:40.000
Yeah, big milestone.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:41.000
Milestone.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Giveaways on this week's show.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Give me some interest in WoW.

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
You've got the secret world, ain't it?

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Oh, you know, I got it because it was on sale for 22 bucks instead of the full 30, so.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:54.000
I don't blame you.

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Yeah.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Check it out.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:57.000
All right.

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:58.000
And I got yelled at for spending money.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:01.000
Well, that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:05.000
We just want to thank you guys for tuning in, supporting independent radio.

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:09.000
You know, we just do this because, you know, somebody brought this up before,

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:12.000
just kind of the whole talk about, like, you know, the family.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:15.000
And that really is, you guys that are so enthusiastic about this show,

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:21.000
there may not be 10,000 of you, but even like the fact that there's five of you

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:24.000
makes like this so worth doing week in and week out.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:28.000
And as we are coming up on episode 500 has really made it worth it

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:31.000
and why we've been stuck with it for so long.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
We don't charge for the show.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:38.000
We're not going to be asking you for twelve thousand dollars to do this here in person.

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
But I am every other week.

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
I am working on a gift for our listeners, though.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:43.000
What's that?

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:44.000
We talked about it earlier.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
Oh, yeah. She's not in a future way.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:50.000
But I just wanted to say, fortunately, though, we have to raise the limit of friends.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:53.000
You have to or the minimum of friends you have to ask.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
You have to tell 500 of your friends.

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:56.000
That's right. That's right.

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
You're going to have to tell way more your friends.

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
We have conventions we want to go to.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
We don't charge you guys to listen to this show.

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:08.000
I can tell you it does not take ten thousand dollars to put on this show.

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:14.000
It takes passion and dedication and wanting to do it for the loyal listeners.

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:17.000
And that is what we get out of it.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:20.000
And so all we ask is help us grow our family.

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:23.000
Spread the word about the show. Tell a friend or two about it.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:26.000
Give us a thumbs up on Stitcher.

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:30.000
And if you're on Tumblr, reblog when I freaking post it and not just hit like.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:33.000
Jamie is just here for her tumbles and wanting more followers.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:34.000
No, I'm not.

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:39.000
I've been I've figured since I've been using my Tumblr to promote the show.

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:43.000
I'm also using my Mass Effect Tumblr to promote the show.

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
So don't give me that, Rob. All right.

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
That does it. Thank you, guys.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:50.000
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought for these two weeks.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
And then we'll be back on April 7th.

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
Dark soccer. Your final thought tonight.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
I have a headache. Stupid sinus infection.

03:00:56.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Sorry. My final thought is hazelnut frappuccinos.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Pretty good. I'm going to go get one.

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
Pretty good. Is that Starbucks on the way?

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:07.000
Any of them. It's all I use the app.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:10.000
The app will tell you when I have the app.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:13.000
You can go for me. Get with the time.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
Last but not least, it's a grind. Hello, Loki.

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:19.000
Your final thought. You know, I'm not a huge fan of these games.

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:24.000
It's really unfair that there's a Beatmania third mix final.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:30.000
And I'm sorry, Beatmania three final and a keyboard third mix or keyboard

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:33.000
being a third mix in Sacramento.

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:37.000
They want one hundred dollars for both Rob.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:40.000
Do you see what the price of Beatmania and you take the keyboard mania?

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:43.000
Where am I going to put a keyboard mania in this house? In my backyard.

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:46.000
If you if you can hold on to the other machine for me until we get a house,

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:49.000
then yes, I'll do it. I thought to Dan. All right.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:52.000
But it's someone's already been on it. So on one of them.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:56.000
So you got to outbid them. But I mean, the concept ninety nine dollars.

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:59.000
We'll do we can. All right. That's it.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:02.000
Have a great week, everybody. Be safe. Don't be a dick online.

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:06.000
I know you guys won't be. And I hope all you guys had a blast.

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
It packs and have fun. A game developers conference.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:12.000
If you're one of those guys to go into that picture didn't happen.

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
And we'll see you back here in a couple of weeks on orange launch radio.

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:18.000
Episode four ninety nine. When we come back on April 7th.

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
Have a great week, everybody. Good night.

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:24.000
