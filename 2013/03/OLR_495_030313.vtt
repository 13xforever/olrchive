00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, March 3, 2013, two companies promise new games at PAX East.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Gran Turismo 6 will be out before year's end.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And could Shenmue 3 happen via Kickstarter?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:46.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 495 for this March the 3rd of 2013.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
We're here to talk about video games and gaming and gaming culture with my co-host.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Over here is DarkSakura.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hi.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
How are you, DarkSakura? Welcome back tonight.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Thank you.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
You're welcome. Hope you're feeling better.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yes.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
As you said before the show, because you were looking at the show and you said,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
495, why have we been doing this for 495 weeks?

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
And I said, chicks. To get chicks.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
It hasn't worked.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I did have chicken the other day.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Hello over there, tech master Loki, who claims it has not worked.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Nah, it hasn't worked.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
It has not worked.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Well, you've been, how long have you and Nelly been together since the start of OLR, right?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
You guys were together around there.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, around there.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Wow, so.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I think 2001.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
And you and Dan have been together that long too.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Well, we've been together for 15 years.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Oh my gosh.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
As of the 23rd of January.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
This show just, you know, fosters long-term relationships.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Meanwhile, over the course of the show, I think I've had four or five different.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I did get married after we started the show.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
But the one I'm on is the last one.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Cause he's listening.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
So you know he's a keeper.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Cause he's, you know, supportive and all that stuff.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Right?

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes, and he's officially my hero for re-reblogging one of my posts on my Mass Effect blog.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Cause I totally agree with him.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Oh, you guys and your Mass Effect lolsy stuff.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Hey, you know what?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Huh?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
You were talking about Shitadel earlier.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Are we already dogging the DLC before anybody's played it?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, that's just my special nickname for the Citadel.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh, okay.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
The Shitadel?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
That's very clever.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
That's very creative.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, Becky and I call it that sometimes.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Funny you.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
I was going to do a kickoff topic for the start of the show tonight.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
But I didn't really have a lot going on.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
I thought I would give a cheap plug to Bobby.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
He's always up before us.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
We do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right before Bobby Black Wolf.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
And on his show tonight, a really cool interview with Ken Allen.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
You may not recognize that name, but I'm sure you recognize his work.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Especially if you're like a 30-something or a late 20-something.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
You probably played Sierra Adventure games back in the day.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah, he was a composer for Space Quest, the old Space Quest games.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I have a confession, Rob.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
What's that?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
I really didn't play many of them.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah, what's up with that?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
What were you playing in the early 90s?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Were you strictly console?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
I was strictly console, except for my addiction to Doom.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
When I hit my last year of high school and beginning of college, I was really into Doom and Descent.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Interesting.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
And I did like Phantasmagoria, but I played the LucasArts games.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
I played Loom.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Okay, well that was all kind of around that same time.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah, it was around that same time, but I just wasn't as into it myself.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Oh God, I love to be-

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I was a console girl.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
I will admit, I was not as into Space Quest as I was in the Hero's Quest, and especially King's Quest.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
That series was so amazing to me.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
I think everybody remembers King's Quest IV, Rosella, because that's the one that incorporates all the old fairy tales and stuff.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Oh my gosh, great, great classic game.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I just didn't get into them.

03:54.000 --> 04:02.000
I think the only real thing I played on a PC before that were the text-based, like Gemstone.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
And then of course your favorite, Civilization, the old school one.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I got into that early on.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I was never into Civ.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
I should give a plug for this. I'm curious what you guys think about this.

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
Microsoft is doing a huge sale on their Games on Demand right now, where you can get a lot of these, not really a lot of new stuff.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
I think there were some things in there like Borderlands 2 and stuff, but mostly a couple years old games from the archives.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
But it's like $9.99 for most of these games that are on sale right now.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Borderlands 2 is a little more and some of the other current ones.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
But for the most part, you're getting games that still retail for $30-$40 for $9.99.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
A lot of people calling it Microsoft's answer to a Steam sale.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
And in some ways, it's kind of accurate.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Today, the reason why I brought it up was Civilization.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
Civilization Revolution, one of those games that's only $10 right now, which I think is a great buy.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
I think it's a great enabler for the Civ series.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
So if I was going to try and get Jamie into Civ, I would be all like,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Poke, poke, here's a $10 gift card. Poke, poke, here's what you go spend it on. Poke, poke.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
But I know that won't work, so I'm not even going to bother.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm not giving her money.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
If you gave me money right now, I'd probably just pay bills with it.

05:11.000 --> 05:20.000
What do you guys think about Microsoft responding to this really deep cut sale thing of sorts?

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
Well, I think they're just trying to push digital sales.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
Trying to figure out how to get people interested in that stuff.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
And it's all about getting them more exposure.

05:32.000 --> 05:45.000
Maybe kind of trying to hype up stuff as we approach a supposed announcement of some sort.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
So maybe, I don't know, it seems to have worked for Steam and stuff to help drive sales.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Maybe that's why they want to hype.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Hey guys, you know we do sell games digitally as well, right?

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
It's not just Sony and Steam. We do that as well.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
So hey, buy something.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
A tiny correction to what I had stated earlier.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Bobby says it was Space Quest 4 was the one in the series that Ken Allen did.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Oops, my bad.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
But I will say that I know this one for a fact.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Because Bobby and I have both fawned over this one.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
And our mutual love of an old ass Sierra game I bet none of you have heard of.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
It's called Jones in the Fast Lane.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Awesome computer game back in the day.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
They kind of tried to make a CD-ROM game out of a board game type of thing.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
It was really weird.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
You had these marbles that would go around, but it was kind of like life.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And you would have a job.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
It was hard for me to explain.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
It was fun, dammit.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Did they ever make a board game based on that?

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
No, but you would see your little character actually walking.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
You could pick your little CD-ROM character and they would actually walk.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
It was back in the day when all that video capture stuff was really new on CD.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
And then I think they had a disc version of it too

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
where it would substitute in animated characters, if I remember right.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
So I know that was one because I loved that game growing up.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
That was right around the same time I got into Civ and all that, in fact.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I want to know something, Rob.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
What?

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
Why people on Tumblr think that I want to see animated gifs of Caden's butt.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Because you're following those Tumblrs.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
It's all about what you want to follow on the tumbles.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Wasn't there one called Caden's Ass?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
There's one called Shepherd's Butt.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
It's because it's like, hey, we saw that you viewed alien penises.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
You may like Caden's butt.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
There's also one that's called Shepherd's Left Boob.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
I have no idea.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I can't even.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
You get out of the internet whatever you want.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
If you want to use Tumblr for nothing but porn, you can do it very easily.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
That's my side boob.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Or so I've heard.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And that's probably someone's Tumblr too.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
That's my side boob.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
That's from Family Guy.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm going to see if that exists.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Fuck yeah, side boob.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I'm pretty sure that's out there.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I'm looking.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Alright, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
BlackWolf, again trying to correct me here.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
The only difference between the disc and CD version was the CD version had full spoken audio.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
The animated characters were still there.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
I thought in the CD version they were actual digitized characters and in the disc one they were cartoons.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
And on the disc version they-

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yes it exists.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
There is a fuck yes I boob Tumblr.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And on the disc version it came on like 48 discs, right?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Because that's the equivalent of a CD.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
The disc version of Jones I think was only like four.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Like four discs or so.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I remember, what was it?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Willy Beamish I think it was.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Was a game I was playing way back in the day.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
I remember that game.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
It was on like 12 discs.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, I had an anime fighting game.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
It was called, I don't remember what it was called.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Something Lace.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I don't remember what it was called now.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
It was like Metal and Lace or something like that.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
I got into it like software etc. back in the day.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Never did get that game to run correctly.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
But damn it took a long time with like eight plus discs installing.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
That was the whole reason you needed a hard drive.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Was because you had to have something to install all those stinking discs to.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Eh, no the 14 disc descent.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Ugh.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
That's where you had to have like a rubber band to bind all the discs together.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Good times.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I still have it somewhere.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
My stack of descent discs.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Classic gaming, what a trip.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
Alright, let's get into what we've been playing this week as far as modern games go.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Not that classics are bad by any means.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I mean, I've been playing Capcom Arcade a lot lately.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Playing classics.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Why don't we just start with Rob?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Well you, well no I was going to say, no that was last week not this week.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
But I was going to say you missed last week and I was talking about Capcom Arcade.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
Did you know that the freebie game that you can just get for free on Playstation 3 is Black Tiger?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Which you've talked about on the show before.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
And you can flip between the Japanese and the English versions.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I was so excited to tell you last week and then you weren't here.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Uh, I think Dan might have already gotten it.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I don't know.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
It's cool.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah, it's an e-game.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
And...

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
It's one of Dan's favorites.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Next week they're putting out Gun.Smoke.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Gun.Smoke.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Gun.Smoke.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
I have a demo for Gun.Smoke.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
It's good times.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Alright, we'll start with you.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
What were you going to say?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Something sassy over there, Logan?

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
I wonder, you know, because now that they are allowing you to get all these weird like

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
URL names, I wonder if someday we will have Gun.Smoke.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
As an actual URL.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Like a smoke dot, like a dot com or a dot...

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, it'd be dot smoke.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
It'd be dot smoke.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Like, they had it at one point where you could get pretty much anything you want.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Yeah, yeah.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
So...

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Well, I would imagine maybe cigarette companies or in Washington and Colorado, dot smoke might

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
be very popular.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
You could get Gun.SMO.KE, like Kenya or something.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
See, now you're thinking.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Now you're playing with power.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm playing internationally.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Alright, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Mass Effect.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Of course.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
No, because I got the Reckoning DLC.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh yes, the last multiplayer DLC.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
I love your little quote fingers that no one can see.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah, well.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
Um, it's actually really good, although my little lore nerd in my head is going, fucking

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
collector adepts, what?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah, that was a weird choice, wasn't it?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Fucking bizarre.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
I just, it just goes to show just how crap the writing in 3 was.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Aww.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
No, 3 has like some of my favorite scenes and it's my favorite to play, like actually

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
play.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
But there's just writing in that game that makes me go, sparkly turd.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
But the multiplayer is so good.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
The multiplayer is fantastic.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
You guys wonder why we don't shut up about Mass Effect 3 like ever, ever.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Like, for Dark Soccer, it's a lot of this fandom and all this stuff she kind of keeps

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
perpetuating.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
For me, it's the multiplayer.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Like, I can keep going back and playing that and it's so much fun.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I've been playing a lot of multiplayer.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
The bulk of my playing's been multiplayer because I, it's like my freebie pack, I got

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
the Geth, no, I got the Krogan Warlord in it.

11:57.000 --> 12:05.000
And then I got, the first one that I actually got with my saved up points had the Turian

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Cabal in it.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
That was good.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
The Lady Turian.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
That was good of BioWare, by the way, to give everybody a free character new.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Like, you know, I think, I wish, like looking back, I wish I'd done that for each piece

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
of DLC they did.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
Like, I understand their whole little micro transaction model is to make people save up

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
the in-game credits or be tempted to spend, you know, three bucks on a pack to maybe get

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
a character.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
But I think it was a good, good gesture to give everybody a freebie.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Well, usually whenever DLC comes out that I have to pay for, I just go ahead and put

12:36.000 --> 12:43.000
a 20 on it and then use my leftovers for multiplayer, which is what I'm going to do when I get Shenadel.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
But, uh, I really, I never enjoyed playing a Vanguard until this one, because like the

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
moves are all like poison this and blades that.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
It's like playing a Wolverturian.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Mm hmm.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I got Hawkeye.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Oh yeah.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
The, um, I have, I have one of him too.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
The Zaid wannabe.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Oh yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
But like with the, the bow and arrow, I, it's weird.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
The omnibo.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
I love engineers, but I wasn't like, it was cool for a little bit, but I'm not, I went

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
back to my human cause I don't have a Korean engineer on PC.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
Well, I finally though, like this is the first time I've actually gotten a character up to

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
20 and promoted.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Nice.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
My class.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
So now I have to start over and I like, I hate the starting over cause like they put

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
us on a collector map right when I just started over and we all know the collectors are bullshit.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Yep.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
So I, the second one thankfully was a, um, Cerberus thing, but it was, it was really

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
fun.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
And the first game I was in though, I had to roll my eyes cause we had a collector adapt.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
We had a juggernaut and we had a Krogan, a warlord.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
So it was like almost all of the, all the misfits.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
And it was such, I was amazed.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
It was such a balanced party.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
We just flew through everything.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Like it was no big deal.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
It was, it was like a hot knife through butter.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Um, technus in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, um, he's kinda done with the mass effect

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
universe for now.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Good for you.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Do you?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Well, I mean, but, but I get it.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Like, is it, is it time?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
You mean this is the last multiplayer DLC.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
We have the last single player DLC next week.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Is it time?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I mean, nothing good lasts forever, right?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Is it time to move on to whatever's next for the Mass Effect series?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Three words.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Final Fantasy seven.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
No.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Still going on.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Still going.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
It took a while.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
It took a while though to come back and then there was all the movies and everything.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
All right.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Anything else you want to share?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Should I move on to Loki?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Um, that's really all I played.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I'm probably gonna be canceling a while.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Sad face.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Just for a little while until I get a job.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Makes sense.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
All right.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Um, my gaming week was all right.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
It started off okay.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
At least.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Um, I started, we were playing Borderlands two and kind of going through that stuff and

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
then that wonderful, um, add on content pack came out from, um, you know, 2k.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
So, I was like, okay, cool.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm gonna go ahead and get this.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Yes, I know I could have saved some money by buying the DLC, either the season pass

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
or, um, you know, buying just the DLC straight from the marketplace.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
Um, but here's the thing though is that I want to put it on more than one system because

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
I play with a friend and I don't want to buy the DLC twice and the add on content packs

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
do not have DRM on them.

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
They also apparently don't work very well because, um, the true nature of Gearbox is

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
finally coming out.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
It's like, huh, you know, Borderlands is such an awesome game.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
Why did they really fuck up Duke Nukem, you know, forever in Aliens Colonial Marines?

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
It's because it's a fluke because they fuck up everything.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
Apparently, Borderlands is just, I guess, some weird fluke for this company.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
Maybe they took some of that Duke Nukem money and Aliens Colonial Marines money and made

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
the game better or something.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
I mean, but the disc does not, the disc broke the game.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Like, the disc broke the DLC.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
Well, I, first off, couldn't get any of the DLC to work on either system.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Um, the people that did get it to work, they're having problems with the DLC not quite working

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
because they can't pick up any of the weapons that are exclusive to the game.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
You get an error saying, this weapon is for this piece of DLC, which you don't have.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
And, so that kind of sucks for everyone else.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Well, I mean, we could probably just remove the DLC and probably have to, I don't know,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
clear a cache or something, re-download something.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
I don't know.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
But, it's still annoying though.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
I don't want to have to go through this process and try to figure out, okay, which series

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
of events do I have to do to get this to work?

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
Um, so anyways, so I was trying to get this thing to work and, uh,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Shadownextgen has an opinion on Gearbox.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Shadownextgen says, Gearbox cannot be blamed for Duke Nukem.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
All they did was they put their existing material and made it playable.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Gearbox is totally to blame though for aliens.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Alright, that's fine.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Meeting you halfway.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
That's fine.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
I'll accept that.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
But, the thing is, so, okay, so it's all fucked up in one way or another.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
For me, it's a little bit more fucked up than some of the people that have the game

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
and just, they can't either access certain DLC or can't access the guns in certain DLC

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
or, you know, the waypoint's not showing up.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
And their solution is, well, we're just gonna have to put out a patch for it.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
The disc is for people that don't have fucking online.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
How are you gonna download this patch to make the fucking offline thing work correctly?

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Oh, that makes total sense.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
It's like, fucking, did you guys test this at all?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Does that mean you have to do one of those weird things where you download it to a USB stick?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
No, there is no way.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
You can do that for system updates.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
Like, the console firmware, you can't do that for game, I mean, you can't do that legitimately

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
with, you know, you can get tools to do that.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
So you're telling me that the technology's there, it's just that for whatever reason

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
they don't let the publishers use it.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Yeah, it's basically you can download a system update that someone's dumped off their machine

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
off the internet and have, hopefully, a tool to be able to put it on a memory stick or something like that,

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
which is, it's out there, you can do that.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
I guess it wouldn't be that hard if you used USB storage.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
It used to be a lot harder, though.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
So anyway, so that's all fucking broken, so that's great.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
So for now, we've been playing emulator stuff, because I have these modded Xboxes

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
that we were messing around with, and so we've been playing Super Nintendo and Nintendo games and stuff.

18:25.000 --> 18:32.000
I also started trying Far Cry 2, because my thought is, hey, I remember Far Cry Instinct's

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Predator had a pretty awesome map editor, and you can make your own levels and stuff like that,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
and the game's not that bad.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
And then I was like, oh wait, Far Cry 2 even has a better emulator, or level editor,

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
and that might be kind of fun to play with, so I'm actually working with the Far Cry 2 level editor,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
because I know I could do three.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
I don't really know, three actually requires that you have, well, first of all, the game's pretty expensive.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
It's under 20 bucks now.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
So I would have probably picked three first, but two seems to be pretty good, price point wise.

19:03.000 --> 19:09.000
So I'm recreating my favorite maps from other games in the Far Cry map editor.

19:09.000 --> 19:17.000
So I've got, I've started from Grand Theft Auto 4, Valet of Gay Tony,

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
I've got the Ziggurat map, which is the ferry terminal that's under construction.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
So I've started that, and it looks pretty awesome.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
So hopefully I'm going to just take all my favorite levels, or I'll just download some if I'm too damn lazy,

19:30.000 --> 19:36.000
because it is quite a process to get that stuff looking right, and actually getting it to work correctly.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
So I may just download some other maps and stuff like that, and hopefully maybe we can switch over that,

19:42.000 --> 19:48.000
because I think right now we bought another map pack for Call of Duty a couple weeks ago,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
and we're kind of already sick of them.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
It's like, you know, we don't want to keep purchasing $15 map packs

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
if we're just going to get sick of these maps in a couple weeks.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
It's just, we need something to kill the time between now and Grand Theft Auto 5.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
Which, by the way, my fucking asshole boss, who didn't fucking take me to Destination PlayStation,

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
Dick's like, hey, I got the Z-Grand Theft Auto 5 being played, twice,

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
because the guy died midway through one of the missions, so I got to see it all over again.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I'm like, I fucking hate you.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
But anyways, it sounds really awesome, though.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
They were just talking about how you can switch between the three characters during the game.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
They showed off one of the levels that, I don't think it was in the trailer, I think it was a screenshot.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
It was basically where the guy's repelling down the side of an office building.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
And so he's like, oh yeah, so one of the guys you're controlling is flying the helicopter,

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
and the other one's like a sharpshooter on one of the other buildings,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
and then the other guy's the one that's repelling.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And actually, as you're repelling the detail in the game,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
you have people coming in the offices and going up to one of them,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
hey, what's going on, you know, what is that?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
So it's just, I don't know, it sounds really awesome.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
And of course, he reiterated the size of the game and stuff,

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
and he just says it looks fucking amazing, so I can't wait.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
So fuck the next gen, I don't care, I just want this game.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
That's right.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
But what about those games analysts that say, oh for sure,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 will come to next gen consoles?

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah, here's what he said, it'll come to next gen consoles eventually.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
And the only way I believe that is if they do a PC port, which they're not doing right away.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
They may do one later on, or they may go the Red Dead Redemption route and say fuck it, we're not gonna do one.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Especially if they're worried that the game's gonna get hacked,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
because that's where you get your fucking keys for,

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
well, they're stupid enough anyways to put the fucking keys for Grand Theft Auto

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
and have it be all the same across platforms,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
which is, I don't know why they do that.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
So let's assume that they don't do that,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
and when they do put out a PC port, it would enable hacking,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
or at least that's how it's been.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
So I think that yeah, they could do a PC port,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
and if they do that, then they'll probably do a next gen port,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
because they're gonna be uprising everything,

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
or making it run better, have better particle effects and that kind of stuff.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
But it's not gonna be at launch, and it would be like eventually,

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
like maybe next year or a year after that,

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
depending on what their release schedule is as far as what Rockstar are gonna be working on next.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
Probably DLC for Grand Theft Auto V, which would be pretty awesome.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
So I don't know, they're gonna be busy for a while,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
so I don't think they can really split the resources.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
I am kind of surprised that it's not in the Wii U,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
but I don't know, whatever.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
Alright, let's see.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
Shadow next gen in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
He wouldn't take Loki and then was bragging about getting to see Grand Theft Auto V.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
That ain't right.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
Well, it's just, you know, they took our buyer and stuff,

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
and you know, our, well he was the vice president of sales now,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
he's some new business guy.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
So it's just all the management people and the buyer.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Don't worry, I'm working on getting rid of the buyer.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Soon enough, I'll be going.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
It'll just be a matter of time.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
But I did say, I'm like, so, you're taking me along with, you know,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
DPS, because they're gonna have Grand Theft Auto there.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
I mean, we don't need to send this VP guy, he doesn't know anything about games.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Alright, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Minecraft, played a little bit more Minecraft.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Yeah, how's the server going?

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
It's empty there.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I played some last week.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Okay.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
It's very empty.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I hardly see a soul on there.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
I do check the logs every now and then to see if people are actually connecting.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
I would like to thank whoever built the ginormous N7 in front of my house.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Oh, that wasn't you?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
No, it wasn't me.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I do keep an eye on it every now and then.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
I read the forums, and I also check my 3D map every once in a while

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
to see if something new is on the way.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Hey, that's different.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
Now, I was working on... I don't even know what it is now.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
I was trying to create this little airship thing that I have a picture of,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
and not necessarily create it exactly, but just something similar.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
And then I was like, okay, I'm gonna make this giant castle inside this mountain.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
And then I was like, I'm wasting so much damn time in Minecraft.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I could be doing something more productive,

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
but I just didn't want to be productive that day.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
We need to build Hogwarts.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Oh, I remember what it was now, why I was playing Minecraft.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Because my wife was watching Hulu, which is being streamed through my Xbox,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
and I wanted to build maps in Far Cry.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
And so I was waiting for Far Cry to download or something like that,

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
because I bought it on PC as well.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
So, you know, instead of buying stuff on the sale on Xbox,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I bought PC games.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
SSJ100Matt says, I'll be getting Minecraft soon.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
You know, I saw at Target, those little...

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
It's mixed in with all the cards for the crap online stuff you're never gonna play,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
like Club Penguin and all those...

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
You know how they sell tons of those cards?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
There was a card for Minecraft.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
So you can buy Minecraft at Target and stuff now.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
I am eventually, at some point, once I get motivated enough to finish the website and stuff,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
to setting up nights to do things.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
So I haven't quite done that yet.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
I know Code Man's going in there, and he's doing videos of some of the Mob Arena stuff,

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
which that needs to be fixed and balanced.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
He's good at all that fancy YouTube stuff.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
He's helping do a trailer for the server, so I don't know what he's up to.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Yeah, the cricket sounds and no one there.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
That'd be awesome.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
It's empty!

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
I almost thought about making it not whitelisted,

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
but it's still...

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
All you get is griefers, then.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah, you know, no.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Whitelist is a good idea.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
You should keep it that way.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
You really should.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
I've actually just been having fun digging my holes,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
which is pretty much all my houses are.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
They're holes in the ground.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Like you do on the show.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Just dig your own holes all night.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
You've seen my house, haven't you?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
My prairie doggy?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Minecraft house? No, I haven't.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Minecraft house.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
It's a series of underground tunnels.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I haven't been on Minecraft in like a month.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Shame on me.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
I get yelled at all the time.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Yelled at over it.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
All right.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I know, I keep looking at your half-finished house all the time.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
I know, I need to finish it.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
All right, anything else you want to share for your gaming week?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
That's it.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Wait until you hear what I have been playing.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
You're gonna be like, God damn it, Rob.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
All right, so my gaming week.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
Well, I was driving around town hoping somebody broke street on Tomb Raider

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
because I heard a lot of places were selling Tomb Raider early,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
but I couldn't find any,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
so I guess I'll have to wait like everybody else.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Boo.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
But how can you not want Tomb Raider after the Conan review?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Although...

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
The Conan, I love his video, the review thing,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
it's kind of hit and miss and stuff,

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
but my God are the deaths in that so violent and frequent.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
It's kind of, I think Jamie would like the game actually for that reason.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
What game?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Tomb Raider.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Oh, the new one?

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Yes, because there's stuff, you know,

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
okay, you got to go left.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Oh, you got to go right.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Oh, you didn't go right fast enough.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
And now she impales her neck on a stick very violently.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
That sounds awesome.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah, I wasn't...

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
One of our listeners got me the last one, the Guardian of Light.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Oh, yeah?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
So thank you.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
I wasn't...

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Well, Guardian of Light is so different.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
I love Guardian of Light though.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
That was a great game.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
But yeah, I wasn't really prepared.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
I mean, I should have known better because like, you know,

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
I know Tomb Raider, it was all about the death scenes back in the day,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
but it was a little more cartoony back then.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Locking the butler in the fridge.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Some of that stuff now, like when I saw that whole impale scene,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
I was like, oh, maybe, maybe I don't know.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Maybe I'm having second thoughts about this purchase because, you know,

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
I'm not huge on the violence, but I'll deal with it.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
From what I hear, it's limited.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
I wonder if you can still make her break her own neck.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Oh, yeah.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Oh, I'm sure you can.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
It wouldn't be Tomb Raider if you couldn't.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Because that's fun.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
And I still want to lock the butler in the freezer.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Maybe.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Because that was the only thing I ever did in two.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Maybe you can.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
It wouldn't surprise me if they have throwbacks to.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Well, then again, her mansion's not really in this one.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
This is a reboot.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
It's a prequel.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
She doesn't have a butler yet.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
You'll have to hope for a new one.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Maybe at the end of the game when she gets to her mansion or something

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
like that, she's like.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
She gets a letter from her butler.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Dear ma'am, I'm still in the freezer.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Please let me out.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
Sincerely, your butler.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Oh, God.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
S2-100 Matt in chat says, Rob, just get it and have your mom play it.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
It could top the Conan's review things, though.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Having my mother do it.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Because my mom is.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Kids react to Tomb Raider.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Oh, my God, Rob.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
What's this game?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Rob.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Oh, Rob, that is gross.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
People, you paid $60 for this, Rob.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
You should be trying to rape her.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
You should be saving your money, Rob.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Get a 401k.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
SSG-100 Matt does the best.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
You should reread that in your mom's voice.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Rob, that's gross, Rob.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Through her neck.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Come on, Rob.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
I would totally be here.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
All right.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
So let's talk about what.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I adore your mom.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Oh, no.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Who doesn't?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Let's talk about what I have been playing.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I have been playing.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
OK, here's your LOL WTF BBQ moment.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
Like, all weekend, I've been playing Diablo 3.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
What?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Right?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Like, what am I smoking?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
I don't know.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
I think the fact that I've been, like, into Path of Exile lately, like, made me go like,

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
maybe I should go back and try Diablo 3 because I was enjoying Path of Exile.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
And, you know, people say Diablo 3 is extra for was like, you need to go back because

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
a lot of it's, you know, patches and all this.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
And I've actually been enjoying it.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
I've got to admit, I think part of that is the fact that nobody else is playing Diablo

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
3 right now.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
So, well, I have to get people jumping in on your game.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Well, yeah, exactly.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
Actually, yes, I have one or two people that play on my friends list, but they're all like

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
super high paragon level and all that stuff.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
You know, they play a lot more than I do.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
So, I'm actually kind of getting to take the game at my own pace.

29:24.000 --> 29:31.000
And, yeah, just on the off chance that somebody on my friends list is, like, you know, a total

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
noob and getting an itch to play Diablo 3 like me, I actually turned it off where people

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
can't join my game anymore.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
And I said, you know what, I'm going to play this through one time, just me at my own pace

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
because I think part of what broke the game for me was that having people jump in your

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
game, as much as it's nice to be social and all that, like, it paces the game a lot differently

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
because people will be off kind of doing their own thing.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
You got to go back to town and sell stuff, but you don't want to miss some of the exploration

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
and the XP and, you know, I don't know.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Like, so I kind of want to just, I want to play this game by myself for a little bit

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
one time.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
But always connected to the internet.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
Yes, but it's always connected to the internet, which is ridiculous in its own right.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
But, hey, at least I got the game complimentary with the whole Warcraft pass thing.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
So, I can't complain too much about that.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I may have to reinstall it and give it another go.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I didn't dislike it.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
I just didn't like not being able to rotate the camera and getting a better view.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
So, that was really my biggest, that and people jumping in my game, which I had turned it

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
off and people were still jumping in my game.
