10111	12353	Sky, and Loku.
13835	17939	Tonight, March 24th, 2013, new games are shown at PAX East.
18319	20601	Wii U shop age restrictions are lifted in Europe.
20881	23924	And could an exploit in Origin allow malicious code on your PC?
32133	33014	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
55928	57669	I'm eating something evil thanks to Loki.
57769	59210	And I totally stole her joke.
59590	60110	And it was funny.
60631	61031	You bitch.
61371	61631	I know.
62212	63532	Here, here's a quarter for that joke.
63973	65394	Here's a cup of coffee for that joke.
65674	66474	I love this coffee.
66514	67355	It's very delicious.
68075	68335	Alright.
68916	70477	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
70657	72498	I ate so many breadsticks that my head hurts now.
73058	76480	who's bringing the food, supplying OLR Studios with breadsticks.
76500	77240	I ate most of it.
77280	79501	It's just I couldn't finish the last two.
79961	80861	I mean, ten was enough.
81222	85784	You guys didn't know this, but every week at OLR is a potluck, you know, where everybody brings a dish.
86164	89245	I bring the coffee, which is funny because Loki doesn't drink coffee.
89525	92767	Loki brings the pizza and breadsticks, and DarkSakura brings...
93467	94188	Healthy stuff.
94888	95188	Gross.
95228	96769	Salad and Chinese food.
96829	97430	Who wants that?
97490	98550	Chinese food isn't that healthy.
98570	99671	I bring you coffee sometimes.
99751	101752	It depends what you get at Chinese food, right?
102293	102973	Depends what you get.
103153	107596	I went to Panda and I had the mandarin chicken with no sauce over vegetables and fried rice.
108823	109363	Delicious.
110564	114686	Alright, we're not a food show, believe it or not, but we are a show about video games.
115266	119328	I'm sure PAX East, on a lot of your minds, we're going to be talking about some of the news that came out of PAX East.
119828	121949	Sadly, I didn't get a chance to go this year.
122129	124811	I went to PAX East the very first year, which was I think 2010, right?
126151	126992	I went to PAX East that year.
127012	127812	I had a great time.
128712	131794	Sadly, it's a little tricky to get out to Boston from here.
132334	133334	That's a bit of a plane trip.
134475	137556	And just with my day job and everything, there was no way I was going to get out there this year.
137596	144119	But I'll tell you what, y'all made me jealous through your Twitter updates and your forum posts and all that stuff I was watching.
144139	146000	Y'all made me jealous I wasn't at PAX East.
146320	147241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
166653	179417	Remember, Orange Lounge Radio does tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or VOGnetwork.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
179837	184298	Not tonight, though, because Bobby is one of those folks that was at PAX East, and he's on a plane home right now.
184418	185058	Yeah, Bobby.
185258	186699	So this is now the Mass Effect show.
189160	191942	I think the entire group from Anime Jam Session was there.
192002	194964	I think Ranma, Geovidea, R.A.
194984	195965	Rockefeller, they were all there.
197086	198507	And Critical Myth, I know, was there.
200309	200649	Let's see.
200729	202871	I'm trying to think who else from VOG shows.
202891	208175	I think that was it from the show shows, because obviously the gals from Britain didn't come out for it, and British Invaders.
209035	209836	One's in Canada, one's in Britain.
210096	211978	I don't think they went out for it either.
212718	214640	Um, but certainly a lot of shows.
214800	216442	So they'll be giving you some updates throughout the week.
216762	219685	I'm hoping some of our regulars, because a lot of our regulars were there.
219705	222388	I know Misty was there, Matt was there, Ranma was there.
222528	227293	I'm hoping to get some calls from people a little later on tonight to talk about PAX East and all that good stuff.
227933	228033	Um,
228954	230095	For now though, we weren't there.
230115	232356	We're going to get into the big news that came out of PAX East in a little bit.
232376	235218	I have to ask because this is what I ask every time there's a PAX.
235358	238160	What was the Megafon event this year?
238180	243703	Oh, I was watching... The final... I was watching Seg's Twitter and he posted it and I forgot already.
244123	247145	It didn't sound like a new game or anything to me.
247565	249466	Maybe somebody in chat can help us out there.
250207	252468	Live.VogNetwork.com is our chatroom.
253029	257671	And ActDeft in our chatroom live tonight confirming, yes, Critical Myth, AJS, and Bobby Black were all there.
258192	258332	So...
258852	259793	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
274093	276095	We were kind of looking back because what was it?
276155	277676	Somebody joined chat.
277736	278297	What's this guy's name?
278317	279658	Catastrophic Moggy joined chat.
279938	280118	Yes.
280178	284782	And I was getting that name confused in my head with a guy that used to be here locally that was Moogle Hunter.
284802	285863	I think it was his name or something like that.
285943	286143	Yes.
286343	289246	So we were talking about all these people from I'm talking like the
289526	290687	Old School OLR Days
317598	320500	So here's my little request for what it's worth.
321320	323521	And another old school person is in the mailbag tonight.
324002	325182	And I know we're going to get to that later.
325742	331826	I would really love to hear from some of these really old school people that used to be on the show a long time ago.
333627	338990	My house is open to you all that can make it on April 14th, which is the big show.
339930	340891	Bring me birthday presents.
341291	342352	No, I'm kidding.
342592	344394	Just so y'all know, no show next week.
344414	344914	I'm registered.
345315	345655	Easter.
346936	348597	Episode 499 is April 7th.
349338	350239	Is that right?
350259	350979	Yeah, April 7th.
351039	352801	And then episode 500 is April 14th.
353321	357405	So I would really love for the old school people to show up.
358286	362649	I would love to see Anita, who I know is a DDR angel, if she can make it.
362849	364851	Just some of the old school people would crack me up.
364871	366072	I chatted with her on Steam the other day.
366232	366432	Yeah?
366593	366893	It was nice.
368413	370454	I see her hubby on Google Plus all the time.
370494	371474	He put out an Android game.
371494	373754	We sometimes exchange recipes and things too.
374234	377055	Yeah, I know she runs a blog now and all that.
377555	378475	Her blog is awesome.
378495	379475	It's called The Eco Maker.
379915	382256	Anyone who wants good home stuff, check it out.
382756	383936	It was Space Team.
384736	385636	Space Team.
386157	387597	Is that an old school game?
387797	389977	No, it's a new Android mobile game.
390077	393558	It's a cooperative team game or something.
393578	394018	I don't know.
395449	401554	I heard a girl won, which is interesting because it was not Pork Buns who was on the show last week, two weeks ago.
402194	405817	The gal we had on the show last week, sadly, she got eliminated the first round in Bomberman.
406237	407979	It's the curse of coming on OLR.
409640	411782	I remember trying to register that as an address Oh really?
434699	436622	and why I had to get Sackbimani instead.
436863	437564	You know who I know?
437604	440288	Because some Catholic organization registered it.
440568	441890	You know who I know would come?
442071	442291	Who?
442351	445095	And who I am friends with on Facebook and I literally haven't seen.
445135	446117	We just keep in touch on Facebook.
446337	446858	Miss Janae.
448020	449402	And she married Dark Child.
449422	449883	Did you know that?
450242	451543	Yes, and she has a little one.
451623	452544	Yes, they had a baby.
453184	453344	Yes.
453364	454745	This show is so fucking old.
455306	456086	I don't have a baby.
456967	457667	I have a cat.
458047	459568	She's a lot better than a baby.
459649	460429	I have a cat too.
460789	461330	I love kitties.
461610	462571	She doesn't drool on me.
462611	464052	However, she does chew on cords.
464112	466753	Loki has a baby, but well, not even a baby anymore.
466773	467474	It's like a toddler.
467734	469155	You guys went bowling the other day, right?
469235	470216	You have a small person.
470376	471437	He's like almost three.
471757	472477	Oh my God.
472858	474339	The video was adorable though, the bowling.
474359	474919	Did you guys have fun?
474939	475840	That's a short video.
476320	478041	Yeah, the long video, yeah.
478281	483662	He didn't let us bowl, because we have the little ramp thing, because he can't carry the ball.
483702	494765	I mean, the lightest ball is like six pounds, and he might be able to carry that, but I'm not going to have him carry a big ball that's got the oil from the lane on it and stuff with his feet.
494805	495645	No, that's not a good idea.
496125	501507	So he had fun just pushing it down the little ramp so that it would knock stuff over, but he wouldn't let us have a turn.
501787	517978	I managed to bowl twice and my wife once and he bowled like two whole games worth of turns for three people Catastrophic Moggy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says What is this?
518038	520300	A show about gaming or a trip down memory lane?
520620	525123	Now I'm sure that comment is tongue in cheek and you don't really mean anything negative by it but you know what?
526304	529867	When you've been gaming with the same crowd for so long and you know
530507	534408	You guys have to remember when we did the DDR stuff, we were really heavy into Dance Dance Revolution.
534468	536689	We would meet at the arcade every Wednesday.
536789	537569	It was like clockwork.
537690	542271	Every Wednesday or whatever day it was at the time, we'd go, we'd play some DDR for a few hours.
542611	544692	Then we'd go and have dinner, sit down.
544912	546673	You kind of build up a little bit of a family.
546773	548233	So yeah, you know what?
548393	550874	It is a little more than just video games.
551154	551894	It's about family.
551914	553995	I'm on my second cat.
554475	556656	A lot of sane people turn up here and chat every week.
556896	557856	I'm on my second cat.
557937	558537	I know.
558557	559237	We've been through a lot.
560199	561200	Memory, all alone in your life
582552	587754	Of course I played Mass Effect because I've got the high-res mod working on Mass Effect 3.
588354	589754	You have Oliver.
590414	590534	Ew.
590835	591595	Okay.
591995	592255	Sorry.
593275	594676	It's okay.
595156	598517	I played Mass Effect 3, got the high-res mod working, and then it started crashing whenever I would do...
598977	604221	The Tango, and I figured out that the problem was my Coalesce INI was what was doing it to me.
604982	616451	Because I had everything set by the old version of the Hi-Rez mod, and the new version doesn't require you to change any of your texture settings in the Coalesce file.
616531	619913	So I went and used my old Coalesce file, everything worked fine.
620314	624197	The only problem that I have with it is that it makes all of James' textures black.
625138	626481	Tango down, tango down.
636341	644827	The cool thing about this mod is that one of the textures that comes with it is one where you can sort of see Tali's face through her mask.
645267	651871	And she's got the extra little bits they photoshopped on that one picture in Mass Effect 3 if you happen to be romancing her.
651891	653352	So I thought it was a neat touch.
654293	655454	She's got little bits on her eyebrows.
656334	664778	So anyway, I also played some Mass Effect 2, which I have now figured out how to use Ashley's skin and hair, except with a completely different face structure so it doesn't quite look like Ashley.
665539	666879	And I'm using Warren's outfit.
667640	669961	So I've been playing around a little bit.
670061	671521	I've gotten the game to crash once.
671702	672402	I was proud of myself.
673777	693007	And then, um, I'm not doing the Fandango Actdeft Um, I also started The Secret World And the problem is that I've had a sinus infection all week As I've said on a previous episode This time of year, sinus infections Like you wouldn't believe, allergies all over the place
693887	716341	and um so I got through like the very beginning of the uh Templar uh scenario and then I was like oh my god gunfire my head hurts I can't look at this anymore so um Secret World's that MMO I remember playing this too in beta is it totally free now or is it yeah like Guild Wars model
716767	720250	It's... You can pay a subscription and get all the premium shit.
720830	722451	You can buy a few things here and there.
722551	724252	I just have the completely freebie model.
724873	725613	And it's okay.
725774	728836	I kind of... I mean, I haven't gotten too much into it.
728856	729696	The controls are alright.
731358	735260	But I did sign up for the next Final Fantasy XIV beta.
735681	737262	So hopefully that'll work out for me.
739764	741505	I haven't cancelled WoW yet.
741805	744867	Every time I think I am, I was like, Oh, but I'll miss everybody.
744987	745548	Weh.
746792	749132	Just a tip on that Final Fantasy XIV beta, though.
749152	752453	If you do get in, it's under NDA, and you're not even supposed to say if you're in the beta.
752713	764695	So, you know, trust me, it would be a real shame if you got in the beta of Final Fantasy XIV, you couldn't talk about it on this show, even though you very much wanted to talk about everything that you were seeing in the beta.
764775	766516	But you couldn't do that if you're under NDA.
766576	771616	Trust me, I've heard from very close, very respected, very handsome sources.
772617	773957	All I said is that I applied for it.
775978	779519	I applied and said yeah, I own every single one of these consoles that's on this list.
779559	780260	What's your point?
781080	782641	Except for the 3DS and the Vita.
783321	784742	I own the good consoles on that list.
785882	787163	Hey, the Vita and the 3DS are cool.
789579	795722	and God, I started playing, I was going to play Mirror's Edge and Dan's like, you're going to throw up, you're going to get sick, don't play it, you're going to get sick, you're going to get sick.
795742	796862	I'm like, fine, I'm going to play it.
797562	799503	Yes, the show is on whoever you are, VOG 155.
803004	804304	Tell us about your week, don't re-chat.
804485	805805	Well, shit.
806645	808786	Yeah, I played Mass Effect 3, shut up, Rageinator.
810547	811327	So, yeah.
814208	814428	Yeah.
816721	816981	All right.
817201	818342	See, they derail you.
818962	821583	When you go to look at chat window, you've been saying it derails you.
822223	831647	It's just most of the time, I didn't really have much of an energy to play much of anything just because I was on so many damn sinus medicines.
832427	839350	I was on Dayquil, Sudafed, Benadryl, and Allegra in various doses, and then NyQuil.
839550	840451	Well, get better, damn it.
841031	842311	I feel much better today.
842571	845773	It's just my nose feels like it's the Sahara.
846633	848294	Actdeft is asking about Mirror's Edge.
848314	849696	Was that something you were supposed to start this week?
849796	851957	Yeah, that's what I was going to start this week was Mirror's Edge.
852498	854359	And that's the one that Dan says, you're going to get sick.
855641	857222	Fine, I'm going to get sick.
857862	858403	It's pretty though.
859068	860229	Yeah, I'm gonna play it.
860369	865112	I just want to wait until... Because the other problem is that all this week I've had bad equilibrium issues.
865673	869836	And I don't know if I've made it evident to our lovely listeners yet.
869876	871036	I've started drawing again.
871797	877921	And we actually rearranged the vault slash computer room to where I have my... Your old desk, pretty much.
877941	878422	The table.
879202	880343	And there is my drawing surface.
880383	884866	So I've actually been dedicating quite a bit of time to rebuilding lost skills.
886007	886147	And...
887868	901360	It's been, but I've been trying to, when I play a game, if I'm pausing at a point in it, I'm actually starting to sketch out what's on my screen just to sort of help me with proportion and space and distance and that type of thing.
902100	910868	It's been a pretty interesting exercise, but I figured my first love has been video games and art, so why not?
911168	912289	And your second love is Garrus.
914062	915123	My second love is Dan.
915223	915883	Garrus is third.
916344	917625	All right.
917745	919826	Loki, how was your... Oh, followed by The Guardian Legend.
920867	922649	Loki, how was your gaming week?
922809	923089	Let's see.
923189	925191	I played Gary's Mod this week.
925431	929554	I actually bought that on their little Steam sale that they have for some indie stuff.
929594	930535	It was only three bucks.
931556	940843	And I was trying to get to work with the game, you know, the Xbox 360 controller, and it's a little awkward because they don't have the keys mapped out quite correctly.
941423	942804	So I couldn't really do a whole ton...
944365	950106	And also I kept losing my gravity gun, which was kind of annoying because I can't arrange stuff without that.
950426	955928	And so basically all I was able to do was throw a large iron beam in the air and crush myself with it.
956648	957968	And so that was kind of boring.
959588	965610	Instead, I went and tried to... Well, that kind of prompted me to look into some other games that supported controllers.
966290	971451	And I had Cave Story Plus, which I knew that supported controllers, but for some reason I couldn't find...
972131	975253	I didn't look, I guess, for the options for the controller support.
976153	977834	Then I found it, and so I started playing that.
978074	979815	And so I'm enjoying that quite a bit.
982917	988359	I also played more Saints Row the Third, both on PC and Xbox 360.
990160	994523	And going through, grinding through the activities, man.
994543	994743	There's...
995683	999205	I hope the next game doesn't do that.
999365	1002506	Oh, let me introduce you to these activities that you've played before.
1002566	1003907	They didn't do that in the second game.
1003987	1005267	They didn't even do that in the first game.
1005287	1006488	They just had the activities there.
1006508	1015832	But the third game, half the missions are just like, hey, you have to do this activity for this reason, even though it doesn't really quite apply to the game.
1016952	1021754	Before Saints Row 2 and 1, it was drug trafficking.
1022395	1024736	Now it's merchandise trafficking.
1024816	1025076	It's like,
1025416	1025776	Really?
1025936	1026417	Come on.
1026477	1034500	These guys are like, you know, big time gangsters now and we're trafficking merchandise like, you know, bobbleheads and shit.
1034520	1035601	That's kind of stupid.
1036521	1038682	Or, you know, oh, hey, um...
1040564	1041644	You can't even go along with that.
1041664	1044967	There's an escort mission where you have to escort them with a chopper.
1045267	1047329	It's like Guardian Angel is what it's called.
1048310	1053894	Half the time, you're firing rockets out of the side of a helicopter.
1053974	1060659	And then the other time, you're, for some reason, repelled down the side of a building and sniping.
1060700	1062741	You could snipe on top of the building.
1063181	1067125	You have to repel down the building a little bit for some damn reason to snipe.
1067685	1068506	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1089785	1096587	I was one activity or one car theft away from completing all of the activities and all the Saints book stuff.
1096788	1098288	And then, of course, you know, lost my safe.
1098728	1099368	That was always fun.
1102189	1105190	Unfortunately, I also had Bioshock Infinite to play.
1105210	1110632	I haven't gotten the chance to do that because I was cooking this morning and also the Defiance beta on 360.
1111352	1115714	But by the time I get to play it, the beta is going to be over and Defiance will be out next week or the week after next.
1115894	1119398	All those Bioshock Infinite reviews ought to start hitting tomorrow, right?
1119418	1120439	Because the game's out Tuesday?
1121079	1121199	Yeah.
1121219	1121520	Am I right?
1121560	1121760	Yeah.
1122501	1124703	Well, I mean, there was the one from IGN because, you know.
1124763	1125143	They bought it.
1125564	1126645	Yeah, they bought it.
1128867	1129668	But I'm sure the game's great.
1129708	1130509	It's going to be fantastic.
1130529	1131249	I'm sure the game's great.
1131730	1133412	Unlike the Walking Dead game.
1133432	1134853	Holy shit.
1135314	1137376	That's been a source of comedy this week, hasn't it?
1137456	1137856	It's like.
1139995	1142956	EA's, I bet they're glad that, you know, The Walking Dead came.
1143216	1145377	It's like seriously one company after the next.
1145897	1148158	I wonder who's going to have this shitty game next.
1148458	1149879	Is Injustice going to be any good?
1149959	1150539	I hope so.
1150739	1154380	Or like, you know, maybe Defiance because it is based off a sci-fi series.
1154480	1157822	So that's not absolutely positive.
1157842	1160082	Yeah, my money's on Injustice actually.
1161043	1161603	But we'll see.
1161643	1161963	We'll see.
1162883	1163604	I can't shade a game.
1163644	1164784	Dead Island Riptide maybe.
1164964	1166645	I can't shade a game I haven't played Saints Row 4.
1168246	1169087	That's a ways away.
1169107	1171289	Some of the feedback coming out of backseas is pretty good.
1171329	1172550	Again, I can't shade a game I haven't played.
1172570	1173111	That's the thing.
1173131	1174793	That's what's confusing me.
1175033	1180298	I'm going to buy Saints Row 4 just because... You're a whore for Saints Row.
1180438	1188367	I like Saints Row, but at the same time, what they've shown me isn't necessarily giving me the most confidence that this game is going to be good.
1188847	1189648	First off, I...
1190669	1194353	Saints Row the Third, I really wish it was more toned back towards two.
1194393	1195213	Two was the best.
1195354	1202881	It was like the best balance between a gritty game and ridiculous.
1203101	1205623	But then three is just like, we're just going to go crazy.
1205663	1207645	And four is like, we're going even crazier.
1208086	1210308	Oh, and we're going to have a dubstep gun.
1210368	1211449	Come on, that's hilarious.
1212950	1213591	That's funny.
1213671	1219577	We're going to have a lot of DLC, basically.
1219597	1223961	I'm like, yeah, I remember the DLC from Saints Row the Third, your 20-minute mission.
1224041	1227765	I need someone who was at PAX East and played the game to call in and tell Loki.
1227805	1228525	No one played the game.
1228565	1231068	They watched a video, a short video.
1231088	1231728	It wasn't playable?
1231929	1233750	Nope, 10-minute video they watched.
1234451	1236193	It would have been playable, but anyway.
1236973	1238154	That's why it's not coming to the Wii.
1238174	1239455	It's not because they fucking hate the Wii.
1239495	1242577	It's because they have the engine done already and they're not going to port it.
1243497	1243838	All right.
1244678	1245639	Anything else for your gaming week?
1245779	1246059	That's it.
1246819	1247440	My gaming week.
1247500	1250822	I had a very Blizzard-tastic week because obviously I played a lot of WoW.
1251322	1255825	I've been working on a Hunter who's like my PvP character and been having fun with her.
1256565	1257546	Played some more Diablo 3.
1257586	1263650	Did I mention last week on the show, I can't remember when this happened, but I sold an item on the Real Money Auction House.
1264230	1264450	on Diablo 3.
1264490	1265250	No, you didn't mention that.
1265290	1267671	Yes, I sold, guess how much I made?
1268011	1268411	A dollar.
1268731	1269912	I made 25 cents.
1270032	1270392	Yeah.
1270752	1271572	Woo-hoo.
1272512	1277794	Because the minimum you can list an item for is a buck 25, so that's what I put the item up for.
1278694	1282095	And then the transaction fee is always one dollar, no matter what it sells for.
1282435	1284936	So a dollar 25 minus a dollar, 25 cents, baby.
1288309	1289190	It worked for you.
1289290	1292853	I can put that towards a card pack and Hearthstone, but we'll get to that later.
1293734	1296236	So yeah, I've been having fun with Diablo 3, believe it or not.
1296436	1297837	I'm kind of into it right now.
1298178	1298598	It's good.
1299879	1301240	Also, I played StarCraft.
1301500	1308626	No, I did not play that new expansion, but all my friends kind of going back to StarCraft because of that expansion made me want to load up the game.
1308666	1311609	And I was like, whoa, the launcher totally changed for this.
1311969	1313611	But I loaded up Star Jeweled.
1314191	1317054	Star Jeweled is the reason for me to play StarCraft.
1317135	1318376	No, I don't have the new expansion.
1319177	1326925	Until I sell about 100 more items on that real money auction house, if I can raise $40 on Diablo 3, I'll buy it.
1328127	1332211	If I make a quarter every two weeks, I don't think that's going to happen pretty soon.
1333442	1334422	So, there was that.
1336123	1338204	Been playing some console stuff too.
1338384	1346487	I have to admit, I played the Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate demo on Wii U. The demo's awful, you guys.
1346847	1347947	It is awful.
1348547	1355250	And here's the thing, like, I have friends that are really into that game right now that are, like, having a lot of fun with it.
1355710	1361832	And one way it was kind of described to me is that it's like Phantasy Star Online, kind of, but a lot more grindy because it's a JRPG.
1362532	1372737	but I played this demo on Wii U and I just like the reason why I want to bring it up not that I like to review games based on the demo but here's the reality
1374554	1375375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1399272	1400252	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1418618	1419579	Thank you for watching!
1441517	1442979	Like, way to sell your game.
1443099	1446422	And so now I'm like, okay, but my friends like really- Was Laundry more fun?
1447103	1447623	It was.
1447864	1452148	And like, I know there are Monster Hunter fans that listen to this show that are like, Rob, you're so ignorant.
1452168	1453570	The demo doesn't show this.
1453690	1454290	I'm sorry.
1454791	1455812	That doesn't work for me.
1456272	1460056	Like, if the company is going to sell me on the game, sell me on the game.
1460797	1478036	So now, if I'm to be sold on this game, either I'm going to have to go play it at a friend's house who's going to have to explain to me what's going on, maybe I'll put it in my Gamefly queue, but it's not like something I'm like... The urgency of doing so just dropped a whole lot.
1478337	1479238	Let me just put it that way.
1480079	1480219	So...
1481840	1507250	Let's see, go into comments from the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Actdeft says, Rob, you need to play Team Fortress 2 more You can sell stuff for over 100 US dollars You know, I actually, like, I was seriously going to boot up Team Fortress 2 the other night And then I got distracted and did something else And it was because of, like, last week's show Orange Right in our chatroom agrees with me about Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate That demo did not sell me on the game at all And it's a pity And you know what?
1508430	1528984	and I kind of have to remind myself Nino Cooney had a pretty bad demo too but the full game's great and like I don't know what convinced me to take the leap of faith there or I would like I refuse to do it in Monster Hunter but maybe because the Nino Cooney demo I kind of figured it out and it was fun in the long run once I finally figured it out I don't know
1531085	1532425	One other game I played this week.
1532645	1538288	I just bought it today, so I haven't had a lot of time to play it, but I did buy Luigi's Mansion on 3DS.
1539028	1543411	And so I've only got to do some of the early levels, like where you go into that first little mansion.
1544451	1549393	I did not play the GameCube version, which I know a lot of people might be like, what?
1549694	1552055	But I didn't get my GameCube until well after the launch stuff.
1552095	1556837	In fact, I remember Loki bought me the GameCube as a really awesome present when Animal Crossing came out.
1557017	1557437	Hell yeah.
1557457	1561340	So by that point, you know, Animal Crossing was all the rage at that point.
1561681	1564303	We didn't have time for Luigi's Mansion or any of the launch titles.
1564323	1565403	So I never played the original one.
1565744	1568326	But I've played the new one, but only a little bit.
1568386	1571988	So I can't really give it a full review, but I will say some pretty good 3D effects.
1573109	1578914	And it really reminds me, and this is a compliment, it really reminds me of an old school PC game.
1579494	1584458	Like just in the way you're kind of walking around the mansion on the top screen and it's like you're finding items.
1584478	1584698	Like it's...
1585999	1594843	for some reason kind of reminds me of an old school puzzler like an old LucasArts game almost with a little more action though obviously because you know you're sucking in the ghosts and all that.
1595443	1597564	And you can find him hanged.
1598125	1608370	No multiplayer or anything like that yet because I've literally only played the game like 30 minutes so I can't tell you any more about it at this time but it was fun and the 3D effects were fun.
1608850	1610591	I like the whole little pixelator thing.
1610611	1611711	It looks like something out of Tron.
1612031	1612652	That cracked me up.
1613112	1613212	So...
1614072	1617714	Yeah, so Luigi's Mansion 3DS and that was my gaming week.
1618974	1621815	So let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1621915	1627258	Again, I think I mentioned this before, but just want to make sure you all know there is no Orange Lounge Radio next week.
1627758	1629639	Have a great Easter or Sunday off.
1629659	1630539	I'll be drunk on mimosas.
1630859	1631219	Will you?
1631419	1632080	Oh, from brunch?
1632280	1635821	No, where we're going for brunch, Marie Callender's, they give you like never-ending mimosas.
1636922	1638242	A lot of places do that for brunch.
1638542	1639903	I'm so happy.
1640143	1644586	That's like the friends that I have downtown that we like to go to brunch with all the time.
1644947	1652952	Like we can't go to a place unless they have endless mimosas because our one friend is like, no, I'm not going if I can't get have mimosas.
1653012	1653353	Yeah.
1653413	1654494	So good times.
1655254	1658615	Anyhow, so no show next week, but we will be back on April 7th.
1658755	1665557	I believe Bobby's here next week, so those of you guys that turn out here pretty loyally on Sunday night, you'll have something to look forward to next week.
1665937	1678321	There may be a best of or something, but there won't be a pre-recorded show because we're intentionally setting it up so that we know episode 500 is on this day, so that way we can kind of plan a little bit.
1679501	1679781	All right.
1680642	1681102	I think that's it.
1681142	1684523	Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook, Orange Launch Radio, yada yada.
1684543	1685443	Let's get into gaming news.
1685503	1685763	Loki.
1685963	1693506	Well, this was completely unexpected, but Capcom announced, I guess, a little bit ahead of their World of Capcom panel.
1695267	1707331	Actually, I think it was teased before that, but announced at their World of Capcom panel that they're going to be remastering DuckTales, like the old NES DuckTales game, which is pretty fantastic.
1707351	1707691	Yeah.
1708291	1711472	You should have seen the flappy hands I made when I heard that news.
1711592	1713412	That was really unexpected.
1714032	1715173	Yes, very unexpected.
1715473	1718153	And basically it's going to have hand-drawn sprites.
1718553	1720814	It's going to have all the original voices.
1721754	1726755	And it's coming to Wii U, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade.
1727175	1726755	$15.
1727595	1730576	Probably, I want to say it was, I think it was this summer maybe?
1730596	1732897	I don't know if they had a date yet on that.
1733417	1734277	But yes, all the...
1736226	1736506	Granny Gummy
1757753	1762795	The guy who does Uncle Scrooge was also Mr. Ed way back in the day.
1780365	1780845	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1808076	1808196	Oh.
1808336	1808816	No, I didn't.
1808876	1810457	Well, then, now I have an excuse to play it.
1811537	1813438	Stop asking me for quotes, Tim Schafer.
1815018	1817579	You had an excuse already, Rob.
1817679	1819740	I'm going to give you the Cliff Notes version, though, here, okay?
1820120	1831624	So, like, here's, you know, Capcom and, like, the inspirational music and the few games are so rich with such a wealth, right?
1831644	1833084	So it's like setting up for it.
1833404	1834905	And then, okay, so after all that...
1839298	1839658	Ready?
1839698	1841180	Sing along!
1841300	1845643	I like that it has the bopping head.
1845743	1846584	But look how it looks.
1846604	1847364	I mean, it looks awesome.
1847384	1849326	How can I cut this off early?
1849406	1852629	Like, I have to let it play.
1859844	1863246	Here's what, I'm very, the only thing I'm disappointed in is that they didn't show the moon.
1864647	1866208	Well, they gotta keep something a secret.
1866228	1866969	They gotta save something.
1867029	1870571	It looks like there was only Transylvania in there and one other stage.
1870591	1871792	Well, it also can't be complete.
1872192	1873213	Yeah, it's probably not done yet.
1873233	1874013	I didn't watch gameplay.
1874033	1876655	Apparently they retweaked all the bosses so they're harder now.
1876795	1877075	Nice.
1877115	1879957	Like they have more sequences to them.
1880357	1885241	You have to remember, as awesome as the game as DuckTales was, it really was only, like, six stages.
1885301	1887522	It was about as long as the first Mega Man game, right?
1888043	1888163	Yeah.
1888183	1890985	There wasn't a whole lot to it, so I don't know if they're, like, adding or whatever.
1891345	1894407	But, like, seriously, when I just heard it, I was like, oh, way forward?
1894527	1895168	And Capcom, like...
1896128	1897630	Who brokered that deal?
1897690	1900612	Because that is like inspired genius for real.
1901032	1906056	Because WayForward did a great job with the Double Dragon Neon, and they did some of these other remakes too.
1906076	1908238	They did the Contra game on DS.
1908298	1912742	They've done a lot of good stuff, and to trust them with DuckTales was...
1914685	1915125	Genius.
1915425	1918966	So when I saw the trailer, I was just like, yes.
1919406	1927348	Didn't we all kind of go like, Capcom has made a lot of bad decisions in the past year, and this is the first time where you're like, oh my god, I can like them again.
1927368	1928208	We're sorry.
1928668	1929329	Please love us.
1929349	1931029	It's cool to like Capcom again.
1931129	1931529	Here you go.
1931549	1932830	Here's something you want to see.
1933770	1936130	Have WayForward redo Link to the Past.
1938531	1940491	Or, let's just see if we can take that further.
1940711	1942652	Have them redo Super Metroid.
1943869	1951898	Go into some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Gamer Girl says, LOL, I'm still laughing because I had the lyrics wrong for so long.
1953019	1955562	The trailer did kind of make a lot of you guys realize that, huh?
1956222	1960487	Yeah, but Dan regularly breaks into that theme song at my house.
1961688	1966130	So I have no excuse not to know that and the Darkwing Duck theme.
1966270	1973353	Extover says, I admit that I didn't play much of the original NES game since we only rented it once, but I'm amused and excited by the remaster.
1973773	1975914	I didn't own it either, and I'm in the same boat.
1975974	1977675	We rented it like three times.
1977775	1979376	I mean, you used to rent it all the time.
1979496	1981257	I think I did own the game.
1981497	1982817	I want to say I did own that.
1983078	1988720	But that's what makes me more, because now that I'm an adult and I can buy whatever the hell I want, I'm going to own this.
1988800	1989440	It's going to be great.
1990521	1990841	Let's see.
1991041	1993563	I should actually text Dan and see if he knows about it.
1994043	1996345	DarkTetsuya says, there's your list list.
1996545	1998667	Series way forward needs to update for 2013.
1999027	2001609	That's a great idea, DarkTetsuya.
2001649	2002249	We're going to do that.
2002650	2003671	Maybe not tonight, but soon.
2005032	2005412	Let's see.
2005432	2010996	Actdeft says, the moon is going to sound so fucking awesome.
2011757	2012837	Technus says, $15, huh?
2012857	2016080	Yeah, it took five seconds for it to make me want to buy it.
2016600	2016920	Ditto.
2017841	2018161	Ditto.
2018862	2018982	Ditto.
2019282	2024265	Here's the bottom line, as excited as we all are, please don't fuck this up.
2025746	2027287	This is sacred territory, people.
2028108	2029829	Please don't fuck this up.
2030990	2033511	Stop raping our childhoods.
2034052	2035292	Was that it?
2036013	2037354	Did we talk about the other series?
2037374	2040776	The possibility that they said they were going to do Rescue Rangers possibly and some of this other stuff?
2041036	2042056	Oh God, that'd be awesome.
2042116	2044878	Yeah, no, it's in one of the other, I think it's in the second link.
2045778	2053601	They said that if this does well, that there is the potential that they'll do like Rescue Rangers and some of the other Capcom Disney stuff.
2053881	2058943	And I'm sitting there going, Mickey Mousecapade, Mickey Mousecapade, which is kind of basic, but I loved it.
2059083	2059503	You know what?
2060123	2062964	I literally tripped over that cartridge the other day.
2064705	2069590	because Midna has been trying to get up on the shelves to get the stuff and she knocked it down.
2069650	2070771	It was in the case and everything.
2071712	2076297	Now, would this mean that maybe we'd start getting into some of the later games like Aladdin and Lion King?
2076317	2078219	Yeah, that was one of the other things they said.
2078239	2081423	They said Chippendale Rescue Rangers, Darkwing Duck, and Aladdin.
2081883	2083184	Darkwing Duck I would be happy about.
2084686	2087689	SSJ100Matt says, from what I saw at the show, they didn't mess it up.
2089178	2089598	Thank heavens.
2089618	2091700	Yeah, it looked good from what I saw.
2091740	2096303	They had the boss fight against, who was it, Magica the Spell.
2097223	2097944	It looked pretty awesome.
2098524	2099164	So excited.
2100145	2102306	I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.
2102747	2104228	Here's the other thing I wanted to say about this.
2104248	2105749	They need to make sweet, sweet Disney love.
2105949	2109011	I know we've got a Mega Man thing coming up later on, but I have to bring this up.
2109351	2110932	Why not just let WayForward do Mega Man?
2114117	2115758	That made me spat so hard I dropped my mic.
2116038	2117619	I know, right?
2118039	2120340	Why not just let them do Mega Man?
2120600	2124982	Because they'll probably do the game we all want, right?
2127644	2130225	So hopefully this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
2131665	2132006	We'll see.
2132206	2141370	Actually, you know who should really be doing the next Mega Man, if they did one, would be letting the people who did the Street Fighter cross Mega Man.
2143466	2145288	Oh, I know what you're talking about.
2145328	2148510	The anniversary, the freebie that was on the internet.
2148550	2149130	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2149931	2150832	Maybe, maybe.
2151772	2156776	One of the other big games that came out of PAX East was somewhat of a surprise announcement from Blizzard.
2157717	2161580	You know, I had the other show, Horde House, where we talk a lot about World of Warcraft and things.
2161980	2166143	And there were a lot of people thinking that it was going to be like a big thing.
2166203	2171287	Like it was going to be another expansion or that it was Titan, even though Blizzard said time and time again it's not Titan.
2171307	2171507	Yeah.
2171747	2173449	Well, it kind of did come out of left field.
2173489	2175111	This is not something people were predicting.
2175372	2180077	The game that Blizzard announced at PAX East was called Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft.
2180758	2182460	It's a card game, basically.
2182500	2183581	It's a virtual card game.
2183842	2187125	It's going to be playable on PC, Mac, and iPad.
2187626	2188247	Kind of think...
2189801	2191482	Don't they have a card game already?
2191502	2191803	Blizzard?
2215202	2239364	they have a tangible WoW trading card game but this isn't that I think it's a simpler version of that and it's not meant to be a tangible game it is a little weird because both of those exist but I think there's room for both I mean if Magic the Gathering can be successful in both a tangible game and an online game I don't see why Blizzard can't have two properties out there
2240464	2241045	Now here's the thing.
2241085	2244287	It is going to be a free game, but it's freemium.
2244407	2245668	You earn more cards.
2245708	2249511	You can earn them through playing the game and you win medals when you do PvP against people.
2250732	2255255	But you'll also be able to buy expansion packs, of course, with real money.
2255635	2256576	They're thinking about $1.
2257536	2259498	That's what they're thinking right now for the packs.
2259898	2262539	Hearthstone will have 300 cards in the initial collection.
2262999	2264499	And it's hero versus hero.
2264539	2268880	You play as one of the nine Central Warcraft classes, each represented by a hero.
2268940	2273221	For example, you can play, I believe Thrall is the shaman.
2273461	2275021	I know Anduin is the priest.
2275361	2277622	Malfurion, I think, is the druid.
2277682	2279882	You can play as one of the big characters.
2280242	2281203	And it looks really good.
2281343	2282563	DarkSakura, did you see this at all?
2283826	2288012	I think this is their trailer that talks about... Actually, let me see if I can find the match.
2288072	2289234	So Jaina would be mage.
2290496	2292539	If you buy me a little time here, I'll try to find the...
2293496	2295478	Well, I'm broke, so I can't buy you anything.
2297279	2299341	But, well, I'm trying to think over who would be better.
2299381	2299601	Here it is.
2299661	2304525	Here's the gameplay video where it's... I'm going to go kind of midway into this here.
2304565	2306787	Let me make this a little bigger so you can actually see it here.
2308128	2308668	Your turn.
2308768	2313592	You'll notice it's very cartoony and animated in the way it looks.
2314053	2315414	Oh, you've got little panda houses.
2316593	2325047	Yeah, it definitely has some of the newer, even though we only see old Warcraft characters in this, it definitely has some of the newer inspired stuff.
2325067	2326409	I quit playing Magic for a reason.
2327090	2328192	Yeah, you don't think you'd be into this?
2329755	2330556	There was a time sink.
2331678	2337982	Now, Loki, I could see them wanting people like you who don't touch any Blizzard IPs as of right now.
2338162	2340183	Someone like you would be great to get into this game.
2340223	2341204	Any interest in this for you?
2341384	2341544	Nope.
2342124	2342524	Why not?
2343085	2344205	I just don't care.
2344826	2345666	I really don't care.
2346026	2348088	But you're not a big card game person.
2348108	2349348	No, I'm not.
2349388	2349809	Makes sense.
2350709	2352310	Well, I'll give it a try.
2368942	2375344	That's where my mind went, too, is I was like, oh, remember when Tetra Master was in Final Fantasy XI and you had to pay like a dollar a month to play it?
2375384	2376745	God, I never touched that.
2377845	2381386	I did my 30-day free trial of Tetra Master and I think I maybe paid for one more month.
2381486	2382106	It was fun.
2382566	2383566	I didn't bother.
2383646	2385567	But it was like 10 years ago, you know?
2385907	2389248	And, I mean, you know, technology's come a long way.
2389908	2390368	I hated it.
2390388	2391048	I'll try this.
2391609	2392369	Yeah, I'll try this.
2392469	2392809	Why not?
2393229	2393849	I downloaded it.
2393889	2395130	If it sucks, delete it.
2396690	2397890	It can't be worse than Yaris.
2399091	2399511	That's right.
2399551	2400871	It already looks better than Yaris.
2400931	2401632	Ain't that the truth?
2402652	2408174	And then if I keep selling stuff in Diablo, I can buy the expansion packs, although that's exactly what Blizzard wants.
2409054	2413115	And I bet we're going to see more of this, especially when the Titan thing is revealed, the MMO.
2413515	2423659	I bet there's going to be a lot of mini... I bet there'll be real money woven into that somehow in its own little economy where Blizzard gets a little chunk of it every time.
2423759	2423939	It's an...
2424739	2429735	It's an extremely profitable avenue for them.
2430517	2431641	Let's move on with more news.
2433246	2437607	By the way, we will have... Well, it's not a surprise to you anymore because I told you what it is.
2438047	2443209	We will have something special for our fifth centiversary.
2445109	2446490	I guess that's how it would be for hundreds.
2447690	2450091	So here's glorious, beautiful news.
2450391	2453032	Rob, we need to have Ding Dong the Witch's Dad playing in the background.
2454392	2459814	But the CEO of EA, John Riccitello... Is that how you pronounce his name?
2459834	2460474	Yeah.
2460994	2463215	is stepping down on the 30th.
2463395	2463955	Yay!
2464015	2466456	Because he has butchered some of our favorite stuff.
2467537	2473479	Basically, the whole reason he's stepping down, too, is because of fiscal depreciation in the company.
2475900	2476660	Yeah, and like,
2478268	2481411	He's basically saying that it has to do, and I'm going to read you the quote.
2481712	2487738	My decision to leave EA is really all about my accountability for the shortcomings in our financial results this year.
2488619	2496066	It looks like we will likely come in at the low end or slightly below the financial guidance we issued to the street.
2497094	2498215	So yeah, and you know what?
2498996	2505443	You should have seen the wank on a Tumblr in the Mass Effect fan community.
2506003	2508486	It was glorious and beautiful and there were lots of dancing gifs.
2524416	2525922	Oh my god, those clothes.
2526504	2528110	Is it really going to change anything?
2528769	2531330	Well, the people next in line, let's see.
2532530	2539992	We have, right now, the interim leader is going to be Larry Probst, who was the CEO from 1991 to 2007.
2542152	2555376	And likely candidates to replace is Frank Gibbo, who is the president of EA Labels, or their COO, Peter Moore, who was once in charge of EA Sports and worked for Microsoft during the Xbox 360 launch.
2555396	2556916	I could see Peter Moore, yeah, yeah.
2557596	2558137	Uh, let's see.
2558157	2560758	Extifer in chat says, at least he took responsibility.
2560778	2566322	Uh, yeah, I mean, at least he was, it wasn't as good as the Groupon guy's goodbye letter.
2566362	2569044	I don't know if you guys saw that a few weeks ago, but that was good.
2569324	2571305	You know shit's bad if Valve says no.
2571786	2572306	Uh, let's see.
2573187	2577590	Um, Bonds006, I have to agree with this comment in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.
2578030	2580652	Uh, someone will take Jon's place and EA will be EA.
2581292	2582253	I don't think this is really going to change it.
2582293	2586655	I think he's just the fall guy for all this bam, bam, bam.
2586955	2590077	Star Wars Old Republic didn't do as well as it was supposed to.
2590517	2595119	Mass Effect 3's ending, just as much as I hate the length behind that.
2595299	2597981	You know the whole big rush on that, the pressure came from EA.
2598641	2598941	True.
2599261	2599822	Okay, true.
2599902	2600302	Good point.
2600842	2603083	And now SimCity, you know, and all that.
2603123	2604203	They had to give free games away.
2604243	2606464	He's just the head of the Hydra.
2606724	2615228	On top of that, though, this is coming out right before, well, right after they found out that they're going to be next, again, on the top ten list of worst companies to work for.
2616709	2616969	So...
2618243	2619343	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2640729	2653035	At any rate, I would like to be hopeful to see better things come out, to see a new direction, you know, to see them stop snatching up companies left and right and ruining their... Fix goddamn Origin.
2653435	2656677	I sat there for 30 minutes last night.
2656777	2660579	Myself, Alan, Shane, and Tim all wanted to play multiplayer, right?
2660679	2664201	So we're trying to play multiplayer Mass Effect, but because Alan and I are in the same house...
2665081	2665542	Fix Origin
2694875	2696097	If you want us to take it seriously.
2696117	2697139	More like butt gin.
2698360	2705652	But I'm still gonna... I mean, honestly, I think that Origin in and of itself is a bad business decision to go through.
2705672	2709838	But I mean, it's like I was saying before, you know shit's bad when Valve refuses your money.
2709918	2710199	Well, but...
2710399	2736802	but here's the thing speaking of all that we have to remember Steam was pretty bad when it first launched everybody was pissed because it was bundled with Half-Life 2 and you had no choice there's a lot of that so like I want to be hopeful and say maybe there's a light at the end of the tunnel and maybe this will all turn out okay but I'm just I just don't have that same level of trust in EA right now they keep fucking it up end of story and I mean
2739600	2747805	I love the entire Mass Effect series, even if there are... I like to joke around and call 3 a sparkly turd.
2749346	2751247	And there's lots of stuff in 3 that I love.
2751287	2752107	I love the gameplay.
2752247	2753528	I love scenes.
2753588	2754669	I love parts of the story.
2755689	2761316	It's just the whole lack of, what's the word I'm thinking of?
2762257	2762918	Continuity.
2763498	2767523	Really going from game to game.
2768724	2769905	Changing writing staff.
2770106	2771748	And you know that that pressure came from EA.
2771768	2771968	Yeah.
2773406	2776287	Dungeon Buster in our chat room, kind of with another perspective.
2776327	2778188	Like, what about the good things Riccatello did?
2778968	2781449	Dungeon Buster says the board probably forced him out.
2781909	2784710	EA stock has been on a brutal decline in the last few years.
2785090	2786510	I don't disagree with that for sure.
2787370	2794032	Dungeon Buster says Riccatello was also known for taking gambles backing Dante's Inferno, Mirror's Edge, etc.
2794652	2798214	I mean, for better or for worse, those were some original games.
2798774	2800854	You know, I would say for better, Mirror's Edge.
2800914	2802475	For worse, Dante's Inferno.
2803656	2805718	But for better or worse, you know.
2806498	2811143	But that's like asking what did Bush do good for the country?
2811924	2813325	I knew you'd take it down a political route.
2813605	2813866	No.
2814406	2821853	But seriously, I think I remembered reading on one other article that their stock increased after the announcement.
2822214	2822714	Yeah.
2824608	2825088	Just saying.
2826249	2826569	Let's see.
2826629	2830931	Ragenator in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, which is worse to work for?
2831952	2834933	EA, GameStop, or Emperor Palpatine?
2835353	2836934	Which would be the worst to work for?
2837514	2841756	I'd probably say... That's really tough.
2841776	2842697	That is really tough.
2842757	2847959	I mean, at least with Palpatine, you don't have to worry about being unemployed because you'd just be dead.
2849040	2853802	Well, and as long as you're on the Death Star that they don't blow up, you might have it pretty good.
2855317	2882406	I fucked up every Death Star I don't know, EA's gonna hire me a corporate or GameStop's gonna hire me a corporate office Now, if you're working a desk job on Coruscant, you're usually fine I'm just saying I'm not saying that, you know, they're that bad to work for To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase, draw Alright, let's move on with more news because Loki, I think you have something very related to this, right?
2882626	2886271	I mean, I know we're talking about, you know, Origin, but what could they possibly fix with Origin?
2886311	2887472	I mean, Origin's perfect, right?
2888513	2890336	Uh, oh, wait, wait, wait, what's this?
2891657	2894721	Origin has an exploit where you can use hyperlinks to run malicious code?
2895121	2895802	No, that's not good.
2896563	2899186	Yes, apparently there is a way that, um... You mean run Origin?
2899947	2902408	No, it's not just running Origin, it's Origin Plus.
2902968	2916473	They have this, and I don't even know why you would need this in the first place, why this is even part of a feature or something, but they have these URI hyperlinks that basically you click on a link on a webpage or something like that, it launches Origin and whatever game
2918035	2919536	DLL at this IP address.
2945157	2945958	Well, that's not good.
2947158	2954883	Opening some sort of malicious file on a remotely controlled server because that's a thing that they have in there.
2955064	2957465	And I love their comment on it, though.
2957685	2963849	Our team is constantly investigating hypotheticals like this one as we continually update our security infrastructure.
2966751	2970534	Constantly investigating, but I don't see a patch for this right now.
2971594	2973456	I mean, they know about it.
2974336	2975517	It's being worked on.
2975917	2976838	Soon, trademark.
2976958	2992767	The best thing you can do is if you have a web browser or something like that, if you haven't yet clicked on one of these URI links or something like that, one, you get a prompt in Firefox or something like that that says, use this program to launch this type of file going forward.
2993047	2995668	Just have it say, let me choose.
2996489	2999891	I mean, how often are you really going to be launching URI links through your web browser?
2999991	3000671	Probably not very often.
3002236	3007137	And then, of course, you know, where they say they're constantly investigating stuff.
3008257	3009137	Like, I don't wonder, though.
3011498	3016459	Something very similar now with the Battlefield Play for Free.
3018039	3020260	Very similar with that is they have another thing.
3020360	3023020	It's an exploit for older versions of Windows.
3023401	3024961	Anything before Vista.
3025661	3038585	Where someone can launch a mod file, I guess it's used to customize games and settings, and that mod file could queue also some malicious code somewhere else.
3039705	3045667	So very similar, but with a whole different game, not necessarily Origin, but that's not good.
3047868	3063862	and I guess they say that it's successful because I guess it overwrites a whitelist as opposed to restrict sites because of this mod file or like a batch file or something like that yeah they upload a malicious batch file they'll execute the next time the computer is restarted
3066796	3067396	Fun!
3067817	3068877	That's kind of lame.
3071819	3077581	I'll keep your Windows updated, I guess, but not everyone's going to be buying Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Vista.
3078122	3080083	But there are people out there with Windows XP still.
3084925	3085646	Who has it better?
3085686	3087647	The people with Windows XP or the people with Windows 8?
3089928	3091048	I'm just trolling.
3091088	3092889	Windows 8 apparently isn't that bad, really.
3093569	3094550	I'm glad I don't have it.
3094921	3102045	I had to use it on my wife's sister's laptop to try to like... I don't like how everything's arranged in there.
3102265	3103546	It's very odd.
3104086	3106227	But I mean, I'm sure it's a little bit of a learning curve.
3106267	3107708	But yeah, the regular desktop's there.
3107728	3109629	It's just... It's odd.
3109969	3110289	I don't know.
3110409	3111510	That's the best way I could describe it.
3115470	3119614	Well, I know you play Origin every day, Loki, so you have a lot to be worried about with this.
3119654	3135046	No, I have not installed Origin at all, and I know I probably have somewhere like an EA account because I did for Burnout Paradise, I think is Paradise, but I have yet to... You know whose fault it is I have Origin on PC, right?
3136067	3136347	Shane's.
3137048	3137829	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3151266	3151526	All right.
3151566	3154188	I probably would have had to do it eventually because Alan's a big PC.
3154228	3155709	He doesn't really play stuff on consoles anymore.
3155749	3168259	But anyway, let's talk about better news and things that put a smile on your face as opposed to angry little slanted eyebrows and angry face.
3168319	3169500	I have a sound for that face.
3170540	3171641	Yes, mmm face.
3172421	3174742	This is actually really exciting news.
3174923	3176063	I was very happy to hear this.
3176343	3184427	The Final Fantasy X HD remaster on PlayStation 3, it's going to include Final Fantasy X too, which I think is great.
3185108	3187489	That is as reported in Jump Magazine.
3187929	3195013	Both games based on the International Edition, and yes, apparently both are getting that HD remaster treatment.
3195813	3197234	Because they're both the same engine.
3197254	3197514	Yeah.
3197834	3202157	The first trailer for Final Fantasy X just hit, I think, today.
3202497	3203478	So you can actually check that out.
3203538	3204659	It looks nice.
3204839	3206180	I will definitely be picking this up.
3206240	3209422	I love that both these games are on one disc for PlayStation 3.
3209822	3215326	Now, the Vita will be getting both these games, but they have to be purchased separately.
3215906	3219088	However, the games are supposed to come out this year, which is pretty exciting.
3219148	3219709	That'll be fun.
3219989	3221890	Yet another reason to not get a PlayStation 4.
3222771	3225112	There's all this good stuff still coming out on PlayStation 3.
3225172	3226813	Maybe I'll actually beat one of them.
3229155	3229995	You know what my problem was?
3230015	3232697	I breezed all the way through both of them and still wasn't high enough level.
3232897	3238960	I didn't really play... I mean, I watched you, I think, play some of 10-2 and I've certainly seen my fair share of YouTubes.
3239021	3240161	I didn't really play a lot of 10-2.
3240201	3244304	So I'm kind of... I'd like to give it a fair shot and play again.
3244324	3247786	Well, I mean, if you had let me know this, I would have just loaned you my copy.
3248746	3250227	Well, I've also got 10 International.
3252815	3255316	Actdeft in chat says Final Fantasy X sucks though.
3255936	3256337	Wrong.
3257177	3257737	Incorrect.
3258117	3260398	I see where people take issue to it.
3260698	3261958	I do get the issues of it.
3261978	3262719	What can I do for you?
3263859	3267400	But as the game itself, I really like it.
3269261	3272902	That's where every gamer has a voice and everybody gets their own opinion even when they're wrong.
3273482	3274082	DarkSakura.
3274402	3276383	Even when they're being a butt.
3276663	3277964	No, I didn't mean that.
3278444	3279004	Only minorly.
3279978	3285802	So, um, here's some good news, and I actually have to thank CatastrophicMagi for sharing some nice stuff with me.
3286823	3295129	Um, the, uh, European Wii U eShop lifted the age restriction that they were having, you know, where you could only buy the games after, like, what, 9 o'clock?
3295329	3297871	Yeah, it was, uh, no, yeah, you could only buy them after 11.
3297911	3298011	After 11.
3298111	3300012	On the Wii U eShop, all night.
3300273	3300693	All night.
3303885	3304465	What was her name?
3304566	3305406	Ronda Shearer.
3305847	3308429	I still remember that show.
3308509	3309009	You know what?
3309510	3310210	She was hilarious.
3311371	3317156	I've watched every single Toxic Avenger movie thanks to Ronda Shearer.
3318197	3320819	But yeah, it had to do with German law.
3321119	3321739	Hold on, hold on.
3321759	3322580	This is very important.
3322740	3331787	Hi, it's Ronda and we'll be watching Hats and Surf Nazis Must Die next on USA Up All Night.
3334932	3338115	Yeah, it wasn't because of the voice.
3338195	3338955	I remember that.
3341918	3345941	The 80s hair and the... No, it wasn't the hair.
3346121	3346942	It was not the hair.
3348263	3351066	Even I have to look at that and go, damn.
3351306	3352227	What's she doing now?
3352367	3353728	Now I'm going to have to Wikipedia.
3353748	3354469	Oh, great, Rob.
3354509	3354849	Thank you.
3355309	3356290	Car shows, I'm sure.
3357251	3357931	Rhonda Shearer.
3359332	3364637	Anyway, so yeah, I think it's really hilarious that we're talking about her and Germany.
3365017	3365677	Oh, she died.
3365898	3366318	Did she?
3366478	3367419	No, I just made that up.
3367539	3369080	Fuck you!
3371963	3374805	Okay, and you said I couldn't troll people.
3374845	3376206	She's had some surgery too.
3376867	3378988	Let's see, her last film that she did in 2003, Prisoner Go-Go.
3381090	3381410	Fun.
3381730	3382490	But let's see.
3382550	3386292	She's been doing Sheer Intimates LLC.
3386512	3388352	So she's doing panties, basically.
3389293	3391553	In 2010, Ronda designed the Ah!
3391613	3392113	Bra.
3393234	3394014	Isn't that a Pokemon?
3394034	3394954	It makes sense, yeah.
3395514	3396115	Isn't that a Pokemon?
3396135	3396655	What does the Ah!
3396675	3397215	Bra do?
3397875	3399336	And the product was an overnight success.
3399376	3399696	The Ah!
3399716	3401956	Bra is the number one selling bra worldwide.
3402617	3403837	That reads like a sales pitch.
3404177	3410059	She plans to add cosmetic swimwear fragrance and Boomer Hottie into... I think that's... Somebody just edited that fucking article.
3411700	3412821	I want to know what the odd bra is.
3431439	3432539	I just went to look it up.
3433019	3436341	Oh, dude, this is things that they sell at the scene on TV store.
3436421	3438483	You guys, Loki knows what an opera is.
3438963	3440724	I watch TV, okay?
3441805	3443025	Yes, infomercials.
3443286	3445007	I also know what a slap chop is.
3445327	3446247	What is a slap chop?
3446287	3448549	A slap chop is a thing that you can chop garlic in.
3448769	3450330	And I had the knockoff brand.
3450410	3453552	It sucked because the garlic is stuck up in the goddamn thing.
3453652	3455373	USA chop all night.
3456854	3457154	Yes.
3459820	3465204	So, can I go back to the story that I was trying so professionally to discuss?
3465324	3470108	No, because I'm reading a comment from Marissa in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Marissa, do you have an ah bra?
3470928	3474972	Marissa says, ah bra is a lazy, saggy bra for wusses.
3477073	3483920	According to their website, it says, say goodbye to pinching, binding, chafing, and discomfort.
3483980	3487144	Prevents bra bulge and underarm cleavage.
3487765	3490708	Fits perfectly even if you gain or lose weight.
3490768	3491268	It's a chest girdle.
3491308	3492750	And it's machine washable.
3492890	3495052	Can I get an ah brief?
3495453	3495953	You know what?
3496194	3498796	First of all, I have a comfortable bra.
3500949	3502391	and I can wash it in the washing machine.
3502511	3506377	It looks like a tank top made out of spandex or something like that.
3506597	3507999	It's seriously what it looks like.
3508039	3509662	Alright, back to the video games.
3510182	3510883	It's a boob girdle.
3512726	3514288	What gamers really want to know.
3514428	3514669	Boobs.
3516132	3517252	I don't know, look at our demographic.
3517412	3530556	Anyway, so yeah, basically they made some, I guess they had to have discussed something with the German government or found some loophole to get out of it, but now you can shop for games before 11.
3531837	3534038	Now I imagine she's talking about the Abra.
3534318	3537379	They had to make a deal with the German government in order to be able to sell it.
3537399	3545301	First of all, they had to strike a deal with David Hasselhoff because he secretly uses the Abra for his man boobs.
3547159	3547459	Awesome.
3548440	3548981	I'm done.
3549421	3550402	I'm leaving the room done.
3551563	3552003	Bye.
3553604	3554005	God.
3554825	3555166	All right.
3556847	3558268	Let's travel around the world.
3558288	3561170	But we need to get Marissa to call in and do Uta's brassieres now.
3562231	3564653	Well, we also have the PAX East calls tonight.
3565634	3568696	I have to keep it on topic a little bit, but Marissa is more than welcome to come to episode 500.
3569797	3571299	Anyway, release dates.
3571700	3575384	Let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out in a lingerie store near you.
3575564	3575825	Loki.
3576245	3584735	Today, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Gates to Infinity and 3DS, and I believe today was also... Luigi's Mansion.
3585016	3585957	Yes, Luigi's Mansion.
3586337	3588398	I can't remember if that was earlier than today or today.
3588958	3590018	Anyways, so there's that.
3590178	3593079	And then, of course, next week, also some big stuff.
3593119	3596940	Bioshock Infinite on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3597420	3602241	Of course, Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3603001	3605722	WRC FIA World Rally Championship 2012 on PlayStation 3.
3609163	3634679	Final Fantasy XI, the Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition on Xbox 360 on PC and 360 Final Fantasy XI, Seekers of Alduin Tiger Woods, PGA Tour 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 also the Master's Historic Edition if you really want to spend extra money for a few extra courses and I believe that's it
3635519	3638560	Let's go to Japan and check out the release dates over there.
3638660	3646362	On the PlayStation 3 on March 28th, Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel comes out on PlayStation 3, as well as Sengoku Basara Triple Pack.
3646942	3656165	I am assuming that is all three games in the... It's Sengoku Basara 3, Utage, and HD Collection are all the games that are that.
3656865	3657765	What series is this?
3658025	3661486	Is this... That would be Three Kingdoms, Sengoku...
3663342	3665844	Sengoku Basara is Devil Kings over here.
3665924	3666565	Thank you.
3666585	3668046	I was like, I know it's over here.
3668086	3670428	It's the Capcom Dynasty Warriors game.
3670508	3673451	It's a little more cultish over here, I guess.
3673831	3675272	They don't release any over here, that's why.
3675472	3685041	They had Devil Kings on PlayStation 2 and then they had Sengoku Basara on the Wii and PlayStation 3 a couple years ago.
3686802	3693064	The Final Fantasy XI expansion makes its way to Japan as well on the Xbox 360 for all you guys playing it on the 360 in Japan.
3693885	3700408	As well as Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel, Cave Shooting Collection, that ought to be pretty good, and Love Toray Chocolate.
3700488	3706170	And the Cave Shooting Collection, by the way, since it is a cave title, I believe, those are region free.
3706410	3706931	Nice.
3708472	3710873	Is that something that might come to the store then?
3711774	3713875	Some of them hit the direct download.
3713955	3719298	Well, Cave, the shooting collection, I mean all the Cave titles have been out on Xbox Live Arcade.
3720079	3725462	I want to say that it's probably, they probably will bring it over here.
3725822	3727483	Axis Games might bring it over.
3727884	3731766	Axis or, yeah, it would be Axis Games I think they would be the ones bringing it over.
3731997	3737590	By the way, I looked up Basara means crazy or over the top, but also stylish.
3739522	3741463	Better than Basura in Spanish.
3741583	3742864	What does that mean?
3742904	3743164	Junk?
3743184	3743504	Trash?
3743524	3745646	Trash, yeah.
3745946	3749828	PlayStation Vita this week in Japan on the 28th.
3750288	3753810	Oboro Muramasa comes out this week from Marvelous Entertainment.
3753830	3755271	Has to do with a sword.
3755431	3758493	Muramasa Rebirth, the remake.
3758633	3761955	Sei Madu Monogatari comes out as well from Compile.
3762415	3763075	Compile!
3763375	3763775	Yay!
3763795	3766176	Who needs to remake the Guardian Legends somehow.
3767277	3767537	Alright.
3768197	3768837	And Guardian Legend.
3768977	3769177	Yes.
3770077	3777340	Lastly but not leastly on the 3DS this week, Nano Assault gets a price reduction and Shoshinsha Kata...
3778260	3782485	Nai Honichi, Made Soroban, Anzan, Flash Anzan.
3782906	3783727	That's a mouthful.
3783787	3784608	What game is this?
3785489	3785890	Stuff.
3786350	3793579	No pictures of it, but the related games are all like puppies and kitty cafe and things like that, so it's one of those games.
3794660	3797382	Alright, how about the UK, DarkSakura?
3797662	3798463	Some stuff.
3799864	3804648	In the UK, we have, starting with the 26th, we have Bioshock Infinite.
3805268	3809431	On the 27th, Lego City Undercover and Sly Cooper Thieves in Time.
3809471	3813034	The 28th, we have Luigi's Mansion 2 and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14.
3813514	3814635	And on the 29th, we have Army 4.
3816677	3817057	That's it.
3817778	3818218	There you go.
3818318	3821360	Just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
3821440	3822161	But first, Loki.
3822939	3851432	WarZ may try to convince you that they were part of this program they actually don't have this program out yet or they just started it it's the early access program it allows you to play and purchase games that are still in development they have a few games starting off with Arma 3 and Starforge also a game I think should be at least a nominee for the best title of a game in 2013 Drunken Robot Pornography
3852673	3853353	Sign me up!
3853894	3855455	I mean, that sounds awesome.
3857737	3860079	Yes, and then, let's see, was it Kenshi?
3861960	3864963	Kenshi, an open-ended squad-based strategy RPG.
3865083	3867064	That's too big of a subtitle.
3867225	3867565	I'm sorry.
3867745	3869366	You're going to have to change that.
3870667	3878333	Uh, basically, so yeah, so they're gonna add features and stuff that will be available over time, plus I guess you'll be able to maybe provide some feedback for the titles.
3879734	3881055	But that's kinda cool that you can do that.
3881636	3891843	Arma 3, I actually kinda wanna try that, but Arma's so simulation that I just would wanna mod the hell out of it, you know, get laser beams and stuff that are ridiculous.
3892644	3892784	But...
3893004	3902408	I kind of like that whole idea about getting in early on the game's development and kind of getting to give that instant feedback and maybe your angry internet comments really can influence the game.
3902588	3902768	Yeah.
3902888	3903328	Kind of neat.
3905309	3907390	Especially in this Kickstarter world we live in now.
3907670	3913252	This seems like a great place to launch a project that started on Kickstarter where your investors, essentially, really can...
3913712	3915032	Have their say on the game's development.
3915052	3916033	There was one I saw.
3916153	3917273	It wasn't Kickstarter.
3917453	3920654	It was another... I don't know if they were doing it through their own website.
3921114	3921254	No.
3921734	3925695	It was... Actually, it was a train simulation game.
3926255	3935337	But the difference was they were asking people to crowdfund it, but the people that crowdfunded it also get a portion of the profits that they receive from the game.
3935757	3937658	So you're profit sharing, I guess.
3938538	3939298	Which is kind of cool.
3939318	3941959	That would be kind of neat to do with Kickstarter.
3946000	3946521	I might have missed it.
3946561	3950304	Are there any games you're looking forward to being a part of with this?
3951385	3952446	No, not right now.
3952966	3955028	I mean, Arma 3 looks kind of cool.
3955188	3961113	I may have to check out the robot pornography game because that's an awesome title and I like giant robot games.
3961133	3963615	It'll be interesting to check out.
3964372	3974180	Alright, well one more story for you guys and I alluded to this earlier when we were talking about DuckTales but there was some talk about Mega Man at PAX East at the World of Capcom panel.
3974800	3983167	Brett Elston, the Capcom community manager said that Capcom is developing a new game in the Mega Man series but they're not ready to fully announce it just yet.
3983607	3985308	I think this is kind of a duh.
3985389	3989812	I mean, despite the canceled projects, I mean, like, would you really just drop something like a Mega Man?
3990292	3994416	No, I think you put it to bed for a few years and then it comes back better than ever, right?
3994776	3996618	That's probably what's happening here.
3996738	4008867	However, since this story first broke on the internet, Capcom kind of came behind the community manager here and said, now, now, now, now, no Mega Man game has been confirmed.
4008887	4009108	Yeah.
4009628	4014938	The company is having ongoing discussions about Mega Man but it won't announce anything until something is ready.
4015459	4018104	So don't hold your breath that that's necessarily this year.
4018164	4019447	It could be a long time.
4020160	4027088	Now, Shane was sending me some private messages when we were talking about the whole DuckTales and WayForward thing and saying, what else should WayForward do?
4027208	4032133	And Shane was reminding me, Rob, WayForward doesn't always strike gold.
4032914	4037739	Let's pull up WayForward's resume and see some of the other games that they've done in the past.
4039101	4041543	Godzilla Domination on the Game Boy Advance.
4042424	4056705	SpongeBob SquarePants, Lights, Camera, Pants The A Boy and His Blob on the Wii Although to be fair, I never really gave that a try I really wanted to play that too because I love the first one Let's see, the Silent Hill Book of Memories game on the Vita But see
4057746	4058707	Shane didn't like that.
4058847	4060168	I didn't think it was terrible.
4060288	4063670	I just didn't think it was great, but it's decent.
4063790	4065431	It wasn't very Silent Hill-y, was it?
4065651	4070174	But here's the biggest sin WayForward has ever committed.
4070194	4070835	You ready for this?
4071315	4074697	A Nintendo DS game called Ping Pals.
4075138	4075258	Oh.
4075778	4076899	Do you remember this game?
4079200	4081142	I didn't play it, but I remember.
4081242	4083823	It was like somebody put out PictoChat as a game.
4083843	4087126	But how long ago was that?
4087146	4087846	2004, glad you asked.
4088246	4089207	I mean, think about it.
4091328	4092529	They've done their time.
4093030	4094250	They did their time in jail.
4095872	4097192	They've learned their lesson.
4098593	4102856	They made some bad mistakes as kids, and now they're adults.
4102936	4106799	Why do I have Queen's We Are the Champions going through my head?
4107119	4107820	BloodRayne Betrayal
4125976	4126877	Shantae Risky's Revenge
4145443	4160272	I did want to mention, because I do happen to follow them on Facebook, the 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3, they did post a wonderful update regarding a fan-made game in the Mega Man series.
4160472	4162293	It's called The Master System.
4162793	4167696	It's an action brawler game based in the Mega Man Legends series.
4167716	4171098	They have two unique characters, and you fight a bunch of the Reaverbots.
4171778	4191031	and you can check it out for free right now it's arcade.legends-station.com slash question mark SP equals master system so check it out or follow the 100,000 strong for Bring Back Mega Legends 3 which they are now 101,000 strong just saying
4199016	4202058	TigerClaw in chat linking us to some Ping Pals gameplay.
4202899	4203739	Check that out.
4204620	4211444	Where you have an actual little keyboard you can type on or you can draw and you have coins to buy stuff for your avatar.
4212464	4212924	Thanks for watching!
4232518	4238466	What if, when this game started development, they didn't know that Nintendo was going to put PictoChat into the system?
4238806	4240428	What if there had been no PictoChat?
4240709	4242391	Would we be giving Ping Pals such shit?
4243675	4244716	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4272549	4275152	You kids and your frickin' HD reboots.
4275812	4278075	In this case it's, hey, I can't believe I haven't done this one yet.
4278295	4281518	Go play this pixelated classic and love it.
4281959	4283500	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4283660	4284481	Eternal Champions.
4285442	4286483	How have I never done this?
4287524	4288405	You say that every week.
4288485	4289426	How have I never done this?
4290648	4293671	I was like sitting down trying to go through all of the, oh fuck.
4295729	4296750	Do your, read your thing.
4297470	4299351	So anyway, Eternal Champions came out in 1993.
4299411	4307355	It was a 2D fighting game and they came out for the Mega Drive or Sega Genesis that same year.
4308495	4318780	And it was sort of like a Mortal Kombat-y type of thing where there were overkills and special moves and things.
4319580	4328009	But, it did spawn one of the best sequels ever, which was Eternal Champion's Challenge from the Dark Side, which was basically the Sega CD version.
4328590	4336559	And two other spin-offs, there was a, it's just set in that universe, and it's also out on the Wii Virtual Console account, 2007.
4338072	4340373	So basically, it's just this typical fighting game.
4340413	4342155	I mean, it works a lot like Street Fighter II.
4343836	4348478	It uses the six-button controller, though, so that you can have the different ones.
4348618	4351940	And the version of this that I have, I got with Sega Activator.
4352261	4353021	Do you remember the Activator?
4353181	4354842	Oh, he had one of those Activators.
4354902	4356703	He was trying to build a para-para machine out of it.
4357584	4358524	Yeah, I think I threw it away.
4359915	4361516	I'm going to tell you how we got our activator.
4361716	4365697	Right before Virgin went out of business, we bought it for $8.
4366277	4368418	A Genesis activator.
4369658	4372459	So that's how we have our copy.
4372479	4374660	It was that long ago when Virgin Megastore went out of business?
4376460	4379301	Well, it was very soon after I moved out here.
4379401	4379901	Wow, okay.
4381382	4382362	Longer than 10 years ago.
4382714	4383775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4400071	4426516	you also had a special attack meter so that you could do different specials and then you had your overkills and that was stage specific I'm getting tongue tied today these are basically you have to defeat your opponent where they fall in a certain area of the ground if they land in the right spot the life bars disappear and something in the background kills them to death
4427156	4430117	Like, for example... Wow, this person just got set on fire.
4430518	4430738	Yeah.
4431018	4431398	Awesome.
4431838	4435520	If you're... You can get vaporized by neon sign in Shadows level.
4436220	4440402	A Tyrannosaurus can kill you in Slashes level.
4440562	4440943	Good lord!
4441203	4442643	That goes on forever.
4442703	4448706	Like, not only did the guy get set on fire, but then you see a skeleton, and then the head falls off the skeleton.
4448806	4449687	Like... Yeah.
4451948	4452048	Ew.
4452088	4453929	There's a drive-by shooting in Larsen's level.
4454289	4456030	And a napalm bomb in Midnight's level.
4457230	4464594	So yeah, there were a bunch of characters, and I'm going to go through the character lists real quick, just because some of them had some fun names.
4465554	4481642	And there were some of the, I thought some of the better characters were in the second one, but you had Shadow Miyamoto, Rax Coswell, Jonathan Blade, Jetta Max, Slash Trident, Xavier Pendragon, Mitchell Middleton Knight, who was Midnight, ha ha with a K, and
4482302	4493952	Larson Tyler, The Eternal Champion, you had Qin Wo, Dawson McShane, who was kind of fun, Ramsey's the third, Raven Gendar, Senator, and Riptide de Medici.
4494793	4498236	People love to hate on those de Medici's, I swear, but they were all busy killing each other and being Pope.
4498796	4500858	Then you had Blast Chavez, and then some animals.
4501604	4503306	This game looks kind of derpy, though.
4503546	4505328	It is kind of derpy, but it was classic.
4505368	4505869	It's classic.
4506289	4507291	Fair enough, fair enough.
4508352	4509533	Classically derpy.
4510194	4514219	There was the slurpy flavor that was Sega Eternal Champions Cherry.
4516102	4517564	And it was at 7-Eleven, of course.
4517844	4521547	Then there were game books that came out that were released by Puffin Books.
4523709	4528033	There was a comic about this.
4528093	4535480	It was called Eternal Champions Special that was done by the UK Sega magazine, Sonic the Comic.
4538022	4539804	Do you remember the group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony?
4541345	4541725	Yes, I do.
4541966	4542206	Yes.
4543035	4550298	They basically sampled Eternal Champions for their songs Eternal and Crossroad.
4552219	4552439	Really?
4552479	4554200	Crossroad samples Eternal Champions?
4554700	4555680	That was like their biggest hit.
4557021	4560522	And Courage the Cowardly Dog also used some of the same audio loops.
4561863	4568665	EGM actually sponsored Eternal Champions tournaments, which I remember a few people...
4571797	4576140	I think I knew one person who actually was in one of those a while back, but don't quote me on that.
4577180	4580202	And then, like I said, it came with the Activator.
4580422	4584865	There is a Special Moves Edition that was a handheld Tiger game.
4585465	4588227	It basically was just a really crappy version of Eternal Champions.
4590661	4613721	and basically it was a pretty mediocre game I mean I thought that the Sega CD one was better and then they were going to do Eternal Champions the final chapter for the Saturn but they cancelled it so that they could push Virtua Fighter in the US I would like to know if there's a prototype of this sitting around because I would love to see it
4615082	4625128	So yeah, as far as the spinoffs, there was one called Chicago Syndicate that came out on the Game Gear in 95 that was based on an alternate reality where Larson Tyler didn't die in 1920.
4625208	4629991	And then there's Xperts, X-P-E-R-T-S.
4630391	4635594	There's a side-scrolling beat-em-up that is based on one where Shadow Yamato didn't die.
4637275	4638176	So, yeah.
4638196	4640537	It's all champions.
4642145	4642845	Overkill.
4643586	4645347	I think this one you get to be eaten by a shark.
4645407	4649689	Yeah, I'm waiting to see if they get to the... They keep pausing it, so I'm assuming they're looking up the fatality or whatever.
4650029	4651010	Or whatever it's called in this game.
4651250	4651770	Overkill.
4653871	4657433	What was the game that had the ones that were called CineKills?
4657893	4658674	Do you remember that one?
4659154	4661175	There was a game that called it that, and I don't remember what it is.
4661195	4661935	Is that TimeKillers?
4662016	4662876	Maybe it's TimeKiller.
4662996	4663736	Hold on, I'll find out.
4663756	4665958	TimeKiller was the one where you chopped off the body parts.
4665998	4666398	It was funny.
4667833	4672075	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Eternal Champions for the Mega Drive.
4673215	4677778	They were CineKills in Eternal Champions CD, is what they were.
4677798	4678838	That's what it was.
4679398	4680239	I knew it was one of them.
4681328	4685290	Alright, we are going to take a quick break and then we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio tonight.
4685330	4688312	We have a not-so-serious Google Question of the Week tonight that should be fun.
4688452	4689793	A little more news out of PAX East.
4689893	4691414	Hopefully some calls, we're hoping.
4692434	4695776	And yes, Jamie's going to talk a little more about Mass Effect.
4695816	4696817	But don't worry guys, not too much.
4698618	4702220	All that and more when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
4708610	4715511	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, March the 24th, 2013.
4715971	4720192	Episode number 498 of our program in progress.
4721212	4722093	Hello to those of you guys.
4722373	4730314	Apparently we've got a few folks, I've been messaging IRC and just got some text messages, that are listening to us in the car on the way back from PAX East.
4730494	4732555	So, hello you lucky shits.
4733015	4733875	Drive safely.
4733935	4734115	Yeah.
4734995	4736236	No, drive recklessly.
4736416	4737036	Faster, faster.
4737076	4737476	I'm kidding.
4737536	4738176	Please drive safe.
4738717	4739877	Don't be driving drunk either.
4740697	4742078	DarkSakura will kick your ass.
4742478	4742758	All right.
4744579	4746059	Let's get back into some rapid fire news.
4746099	4749080	Rob, there are things that are more painful to kick than the ass.
4751081	4753722	DarkSakura will kick you in the taint or the ah bra.
4754022	4755043	She will snap your ah bra.
4756829	4757529	I will cut a bitch.
4758370	4759850	And she'll say, you mad brah?
4764213	4765673	Rapid fire news time, Loki.
4767494	4770616	And there's things locally I wish I could buy.
4771896	4779400	Borderlands 2, they were teasing a while back at South by Southwest that there was going to be a brand new character class.
4779460	4782061	Well, PAX East, they finally revealed what that's going to be.
4782801	4784062	It is Krieg
4784622	4791425	The Psycho, or Kreek the, I guess, I don't know what you call it, the reformed Psycho.
4791886	4793927	He's basically a Psycho from the game.
4794987	4808734	His primary form of attack is melee, which sounds lame, actually, when you think about it, because this is a game about guns, and also because the character I've been actually playing as Zero has a melee attack, and I fucking hate using it.
4809014	4809394	It's disgusting.
4809434	4812979	And of course, there's going to be an Ultimate Vault Hunter upgrade pack on April 2nd.
4812999	4814561	It's going to raise the game's level cap from 50 to 61.
4829545	4830506	Not 60, but 61.
4830986	4830506	61.
4832707	4833867	That's so much bigger.
4834208	4840111	And I guess the upgrade pack will be part of the season pass.
4840651	4843113	So, you know, that's cool.
4843733	4848336	The Psycho Pack will not be part of the season pass content.
4849857	4860923	and also I guess the upgrade pack is going to have the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode which of course will raise level caps of all the enemies in the third playthrough.
4863025	4868788	And of course the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode that's going to be if you don't have the season pass $5 for 400 Microsoft points.
4869589	4874472	Also the Psycho pack is $9.99 or 800 Microsoft points.
4874492	4876413	That's coming in May at some point.
4878115	4881418	and, uh, last piece of DLC, I guess, is coming out in June.
4881698	4882919	And that's gonna be part of the campaign.
4885901	4886602	Uh, let's see here.
4887603	4891786	And I'm laughing because I just got a text from Bobby Blackwolf saying, I'm driving recklessly.
4893628	4894829	Yell at Bobby DarkSakura.
4894869	4895289	Yell at him.
4895849	4895990	Eh!
4896010	4897431	Alright.
4897531	4897931	Bye.
4898031	4898432	Hi, Bobby.
4898612	4898752	Bye.
4899552	4900393	That's my new word, by the way.
4900413	4903636	No, we haven't done anything worthy of cancellation tonight.
4905854	4906615	in this half of the show.
4907956	4908457	Sorry, Loki.
4909178	4910860	Dust and Elysian Tales coming to Steam.
4912462	4916287	And no word on when, but it is coming.
4916387	4922254	They're going to be, I guess, not going to be doing a whole lot different than the other versions.
4923135	4943819	but at least it'll look nice if I didn't see them and then the thing I want to know is anyone going to fucking buy this game because I kind of want to buy this game but I want people to play with and you know no one answered me on Twitter so fuck them I'm sure that they had you know more important things to do wait I think that was actually before PAX so fuck you guys for not responding back in the first place and I bet if you ask on Tumblr you'll just get a bunch of likes and no answers
4944099	4951383	Yeah, so, but yes, Duke Nukem 3D has come out on Steam as part of this Megaton edition.
4951684	4962310	It's basically Duke Nukem, kind of remastered, with all the, basically, you know, I knew that they had expansion packs, but I never knew anything was actually kind of official.
4962330	4965872	I thought it was just kind of this third, like a company making like a skin or something.
4965892	4967293	Yeah, I always thought it was a bunch of homegrown stuff.
4969714	4973237	Wait, but I have the actual Duke Nukem 3D Mega Edition CD-ROM.
4973377	4974938	I can't just use that.
4975099	4977440	I have to get the Steam version so I can play through Steam, right?
4977500	4978281	I think so, yeah.
4978842	4979322	Bitches.
4979402	4979902	How much is it?
4980703	4979902	$10.
4980743	4982885	You know, I may have to do this.
4983265	4983686	I'm tempted.
4983706	4996136	It's Duke Nukem 3D, the Atomic Edition, so you got your four campaigns right there, plus the three bundled expansions, Duke's Caribbean, Life is a Beach, Duke, Nuclear Winter, and Duke It Out in D.C.,
4997116	5003221	And I guess, you know, the PC and Mac and they're the OpenGL versions of the game.
5003541	5005082	Duke Nukem's in our chat right now.
5005142	5006263	Well, hail to the king, baby.
5006743	5009225	Saying, I used to have the Kiloton collection.
5009305	5010446	That was official, I believe.
5010486	5011207	That's the one we have.
5011947	5014069	Actually, Alan has it and I just stole it.
5014429	5014649	What?
5014970	5015831	It doesn't have it right now?
5015851	5015891	No...
5029497	5030498	Instant gratification.
5030659	5030999	I don't care.
5031660	5035084	I want... Here's what I want as part of Steamworks.
5036226	5041372	I want custom map supports because, man, I used to make Duke Nukem maps all day long, man.
5041913	5043515	That was... I had one...
5045216	5045857	I love this story.
5046197	5049739	I had one where it was basically a water park or a water slide.
5049939	5053121	It was just the moving water and you would kind of go along with it and move really fast.
5053881	5054541	And there was a drop.
5054761	5056823	Because you take no fall damage, you fall in water.
5057363	5060845	So the drop was done with holding Paige down.
5060865	5061605	It would lower the floor.
5063006	5065647	I put a paperweight on Paige down and went and had lunch.
5065707	5066808	And I came back later on.
5067008	5069009	That drop was five minutes long.
5069029	5071310	It was great.
5075348	5077729	Superfast Elevator Superfast Elevator
5104141	5106042	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5131378	5140888	I didn't catch everything that's supposed to be in this game, but apparently one of the things they're adding are units from XCOM squads, which is a little silly, but okay, it can work.
5141609	5149797	They're going to be paratroopers who drop in 40 units away as opposed to 9 units away, so alright, I can kind of see where they're doing that.
5150037	5177359	but I kind of missed what else was supposed to be big about this expansion damn and there's not even the video of the XCOM units there anymore but alright if it's a Civ 5 expansion I'm gonna get it anyway I will buy that just as fast as Dark Tetsuya will be buying this next game it's La Mulana which has a launch date now for Steam it's April 15th just in time file your taxes and then play an even greater enemy in La Mulana or someone can get it for me for my birthday
5178239	5178919	and DarkSakura.
5205929	5211054	This is the version that's based on the WiiWare game, which took forever to come out.
5211154	5216860	But the Steam version will have the WiiWare DLC Hell Temple, because you know the game wasn't hard enough.
5217260	5222205	You can plug in a USB controller like your Xbox 360 controller and controller away.
5223766	5228089	Interesting comment this week from some of the folks behind Super Meat Boy.
5228769	5239615	Tommy Refens talking about DRM in the wake of all the SimCity hubble-blue going on, saying that basically DRM is how developers shoot themselves in the foot.
5239855	5240115	Quote,
5240675	5241456	Thank you for watching.
5259219	5267766	A company will spend massive amounts of money on DRM and the internet will break it in a matter of days in most cases When the DRM is broken, is it worth the money spent to implement it?
5267926	5274531	Did the week of unbroken DRM for your game gain you any sales from potential pirates due to the inability to pirate at launch?
5274991	5279655	Again, there's no way of telling and as such cannot be used as an accurate justification for spending money
5281411	5291038	Now, hold on though, as much as you want to go, yeah, DRM sucks, and I do think overdoing DRM is pretty bad.
5291058	5298424	The Steam DRM doesn't annoy me, but some of these DRMs that we've heard about in the past where you get knocked offline and so forth, that stuff annoys me.
5298744	5302987	And the SimCity stuff, for me, that was really never an issue with the DRM.
5303007	5303748	I didn't really care.
5305009	5308932	Just the fact that you had to play SimCity through Origin, I knew it was going to be bad.
5311058	5313099	But some folks are playing it and enjoying it.
5313159	5313839	So you know what?
5313859	5314719	More power to you.
5315040	5316100	I'm having fun with my games.
5316140	5316840	You have fun with yours.
5317380	5319041	But here's the thing about this whole comment.
5319481	5324063	Did the week of unbroken DRM for your game gain you any sales from potential pirates?
5324403	5331086	See, I would argue maybe because the most critical time for new game sales is that first week.
5331586	5338749	So yeah, if a copy protection or whatever scheme can hold things off for a week, then yeah, actually it might be worth it.
5339269	5340410	But at what price?
5340790	5348656	And that's the problem I have is that when that DRM starts to step on the toes of the legitimate player, that's when I have a problem with it.
5348716	5357402	And when you have a game like SimCity where the DRM is really bad as far as like the launch week was all messed up, you may have people that are just like, you know what?
5358282	5362465	I'm just not going to pirate that game because I don't want to play it.
5362485	5363186	Yeah.
5364198	5365920	The Walking Dead Intro Video
5385638	5388339	I kid you not, and you can even see this in the reviews.
5388599	5389839	Yeah, I saw the video.
5390239	5391499	That was bad.
5391639	5394020	The mouse is still there, right?
5394040	5394820	The mouse pointer.
5395000	5395420	That's bad.
5396521	5396821	Really?
5397381	5397681	Really?
5399661	5404863	Come on, that just says... I'm bragging about how little effort I put into this game.
5405183	5406023	That's what that says.
5406812	5433458	and it's so sad that there's like there's bad Walking Dead and there's good Walking Dead like really good Walking Dead and the bad Walking Dead people bought a lot I'm sure a lot of people bought a lot of because or you know stores brought in copies of because the last one did really well and they're like not knowing that the two have nothing in common except that they're based loosely on the same thing even though the good ones from the comics and the bad ones from the TV show right that's unfortunate
5435261	5441131	Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says everyone should play The Walking Dead, the Telltale game, of course.
5443175	5470089	Dungeon Buster speaking about SimCity in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says it has other issues outside of the always online thing let's watch the broken traffic go in circles I find the whole limited space extremely limited space for the city kind of interesting now granted the old SimCity games had that too but the fact that people have broken it so that you can go outside those lines is really curious to me but again I'm
5471573	5476229	I had no interest in SimCity before I really don't now let's move on
5477873	5480215	I like a nap in SimCity.
5480755	5481376	That sounds better.
5481476	5482116	No nap.
5482557	5483017	Stories.
5484878	5488121	This is supposedly rapid fire news that's been going on for 20 minutes now.
5488901	5494386	Speaking of The Walking Dead, by the way, it's supposed to be coming out on Vita, the Telltale version that is, as in the good one.
5495206	5496927	So you can play it on the Vita.
5496948	5502031	They don't know when, or if it's even going to be episodic or if it's going to be all at once, but it'll be there.
5502972	5506155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5522887	5525671	I also picked up DLC Quest.
5526352	5527053	I forgot to mention.
5527373	5528775	I didn't play it, but I picked it up.
5528835	5529496	It was like three bucks.
5529596	5530157	I need to get that.
5530177	5531078	Incredibly short.
5531759	5531879	Oh.
5532379	5533781	About an hour worth of your time.
5534122	5535043	Well, for three bucks.
5535063	5536445	Three bucks, that's not a waste.
5536505	5538047	There's a lot worse things I could spend.
5539522	5540183	for an hour of my time.
5540203	5551033	But there's also Runner 2, Future Legend of the Rhythm Alien, Super Hexagon, Proteus, Retro City Rampage, and VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
5564506	5568169	but To The Moon though, I am in love with that game.
5568269	5569591	I'm playing it very slowly on purpose.
5569611	5570492	To The Moon, Jamie!
5570692	5571312	To The Moon!
5571553	5577939	I'm basically playing a level a week so that I can sort of draw out the game because it's really, I really think it's adorable.
5578019	5579401	As I mentioned, Gary's mine for three bucks.
5581170	5590877	and Diablo 3 is supposed to be on consoles, but not necessarily exclusive to the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4.
5591677	5596160	It has been confirmed for both, but they're not saying that that's the only place it's going to be.
5597501	5598862	Can you imagine if they brought it to the Vita?
5599656	5600376	That'd be pretty sweet.
5600416	5601037	That'd be cool.
5601217	5607480	Leaving the door open, though, for the Xbox 360 and the Wii U. I could see the Wii U. I want Unicorns and Ponies edition.
5608060	5609301	There's nothing but that map.
5609361	5611402	You need to go to Whimsyville or whatever it's called.
5611442	5613043	Yeah, they need to have the Whimsyville edition.
5613463	5614923	There's nothing but Whimsyville Quest.
5614963	5616324	Whimsyville's kind of hard, actually.
5616664	5617825	Isn't it Whimsy Shire?
5617885	5620506	Who cares?
5620666	5625288	Ponies and Unicorns and Fairies and Rainbows and Barf.
5625469	5627350	Specific, specific, specifics.
5629028	5632990	Catastrophic Moggy in our chatroom wants to know, are you excited for the To the Moon sequel?
5633590	5633850	Yes!
5634370	5635331	Called To the Venus.
5635631	5636331	No, I just made that up.
5636471	5637292	To the butt.
5637812	5641133	No, I will be excited when I finish To the Moon.
5642514	5644455	Alright, that does it for Rapid Fire News tonight.
5644495	5646976	So let's go to our Fugle Question of the Week.
5655069	5657370	We ask a question on Facebook and a question on Google.
5657410	5658711	We collect your responses.
5659091	5661692	You slam Facebook and Google together, you get Google.
5662313	5665234	And this week, you guys, not a serious question.
5665314	5667155	We decided to have a little fun with it this week.
5667795	5677220	In the spirit of PAX East and our upcoming 500th episode, a lot of you have joked in the past that you'd like to see a VOGCon or some type of IRL event.
5677620	5681483	What would a VOGCon or your dream convention consist of?
5681543	5683284	So we're talking about people's dream conventions.
5684005	5693191	Gamer Girl on Facebook starting us off saying, I think it would consist of DDR event in-house, whoever's it would be at, pizza, Mass Effect, and Pinkberry.
5693892	5695453	That's just a Friday night at Jamie's.
5695473	5696493	What are you talking about?
5697214	5702097	Actually, that literally is a Friday night at my house because that's exactly what I was doing.
5702698	5705160	VOGCon has suddenly become slumber party at Jamie's.
5705885	5706646	That would be fun.
5707567	5712193	Haseo Tsuburagawa says, VOGCon should have Loki in the Tingle costume.
5712253	5712674	Just saying.
5713054	5713775	Get over it.
5714856	5715838	I mean, seriously.
5718412	5721313	If you really wanted it to happen, Eye of Judgment would have worked.
5721433	5722374	It just didn't, okay?
5722974	5723314	You know what?
5723334	5726436	You should actually... I should have made that same... You just should wear your Sackboy outfit.
5726696	5736242	I should have made that same bet with, you know, the freaking Wonderbook, because that thing flopped almost faster than... You should have made the same bet with the Wii U. Oh!
5736482	5737383	Alright, moving on.
5737623	5739164	That did still mill in copies, so... Oh, it did?
5739184	5739604	Oh, never mind.
5740024	5741665	Well, then, yes, you should have made the same bet with me.
5741705	5742585	In January, no.
5742905	5743726	All right.
5744226	5750108	AZHP responds and says, as someone who goes to conventions, don't we all go to conventions at some point?
5750128	5750449	All right.
5750569	5763074	As someone who goes to conventions, I don't really care what actually happens at the event as long as there are cool people to hang out with, which basically means that a VOGCon would automatically be the second best convention ever behind Fanime.
5763114	5763994	Let's be honest, guys.
5764735	5765115	Fair enough.
5766775	5775658	James S replies and says, all I know is if Dan and DarkSakura are in the same building, they're not allowed to fight or bicker at one another at all.
5777519	5778179	Just kidding.
5778219	5778799	Love you guys.
5783276	5805986	DarkTetsuya said I think each show on the network should be represented with a different event like for us I'm assuming meaning OLR it would have to be either a classic game or a music game competition celebrating both our roots and video games roots in general I think we'd have to do the music game and let Bobby have the classic game I can't remember his tagline off the top of my head but he talks about gaming's history and all that
5808327	5815494	Fabrice A replies and says, Dan should host a DDR tournament called Dan's Central.
5820219	5821821	You know what Dan's reply to that would be?
5822101	5823782	Dan's Central.
5823983	5825844	He'd make his gorilla face and go, really?
5826525	5828968	That got a like from Tiara, essentially.
5829028	5830969	She replied and said seconded, essentially.
5831693	5832173	She would.
5832754	5833234	Alright.
5833694	5835776	Ossifer has an answer.
5836256	5836697	Oh boy.
5837257	5842641	A VOG con would consist of different gingerbread treats and fuzzy red teddy bears named Rob.
5844582	5846283	Your sexy gingerbread legs.
5846363	5851947	The rave would only play disco disco and main dinner entrees would always be garnished with oranges.
5852488	5852848	Mmm.
5852928	5854529	VOG themed alcoholic drinks.
5854929	5857171	A gingerbread legs martini sounds nice.
5857571	5859933	Some cinnamon rum and butterscotch schnapps.
5860546	5868135	Hanging with the people that I listen to so much and finally, in other words, putting faces to the people that I love listening to.
5879267	5891420	Oh, and of course, DDR, Pinkberry, because I've never had it, Loki in a Tingle costume, and most of all, and I repeat this, everyone that makes VOG a network meshing together and having a great time, because in the end, that's what matters most.
5891781	5895505	And then you follow that up with, oh, and Taco Cabana for Shane, which Shane liked.
5896245	5898106	See, I like Codeman.
5898206	5899207	Who doesn't like tacos?
5899807	5901408	I'm going to give a like for tacos as well.
5902569	5903370	I like Codeman.
5903610	5904370	Codeman's cool.
5904450	5904950	Yeah, he's cool.
5905311	5906091	We're supposed to play Mass Effect.
5906111	5908813	We've been supposedly playing Mass Effect 3 online for like two weeks.
5908913	5909373	You know what?
5909954	5913035	My next LOL effect picture is going to involve tacos.
5913936	5914356	Amazing.
5915537	5916818	Everything should involve tacos.
5917858	5919039	In this case, it'll be indigestion.
5920079	5937686	Daniel N replies and says, if I can see the OLR cast and Bobby get back on a DDR pad, and Bobby is in caps, get back on a DDR pad on Heavy as they are now, and a tattoo artist on hand to do Mass Effect art, that would be a good VOGCon.
5938386	5946014	I believe, and I'm sure I'll get a text message in a few minutes here if I'm incorrect, I don't believe Bobby was ever a DDR player.
5946314	5948296	He was way more into Beatmania and all that.
5948537	5949478	You know what's actually funny?
5949818	5950018	Huh?
5950579	5955244	Well, since I've been getting on my big fitness kick, we're actually going to be hooking back up the DDR in my house.
5956124	5957085	I would play DDR.
5957246	5961210	I would bring back my alter ego, Dr. Dick, one last time at VOGCon.
5961750	5965173	I liked Mr. Spanky, but you wouldn't cosplay him.
5965293	5966454	Remember when I did the DDR tour?
5967015	5967795	Do you still have the hat?
5968015	5974161	I'm too fat to cosplay Mr. Spanky, and if you think these comments from Ossifer are creepy now... Mr. Spanky was bigger than you.
5975982	5976303	Okay?
5976583	5978364	I saw Mr. Spanky, and that was disgusting.
5978464	5979005	That is true.
5979145	5980186	By the way, do you still have the hat?
5981187	5981987	That orange fuzzy hat?
5982007	5983068	I might, actually.
5983128	5986151	You know what I found when I was looking for my art supplies the other day?
5986631	5987232	The orange bat.
5988248	5988888	I still have that.
5989268	5989888	I know I have that.
6012233	6014315	Nobody else suggesting the location.
6014355	6020419	I mean, we're in Sacramento, but there's lots of people on VOG, so we'd have to hold it in some type of central location.
6021379	6024201	Anyhow, going next to Actdeft.
6024782	6038791	For me, a VOGCon would just simply consist of hanging with all my fellow VOG staffers in the VOG community, playing games, talking or discussing, maybe doing a special show for all the listeners, and doing what friends do, enjoying the moment with each other.
6040272	6040592	Aww.
6042715	6043415	Excuse me, hairball.
6044336	6047977	And lastly, Red Entertainment, Loki in a Tingle costume.
6048477	6050477	That is like three people that said that.
6051138	6052178	It's not going to happen.
6053218	6057199	You got the closest thing, which was a... The Sackboy was pretty epic.
6057460	6061121	An artistic reenactment of what that would look like, and that was it.
6062501	6063161	Alright, awesome.
6064182	6070564	I actually read all the answers tonight, but join us on Facebook or Google Plus for future questions.
6070644	6072305	We'll do some more serious ones next time.
6072325	6073725	But I thought that would be a fun question to ask.
6073745	6074686	What's your dream convention?
6075046	6075706	I will say this.
6075846	6081048	VOG may not be having a convention this year, but we're going to be heavily represented at DragonCon this year.
6081948	6088871	So I would say if you're in that southeast part of the country, or even if you're not, because I'm not, really try to plan on that.
6088911	6089171	Because
6089628	6091069	I'll be there representing OLR.
6091449	6093610	Travis will be there representing Under Sedation Live.
6094191	6097052	I'm pretty sure PodCulture usually goes.
6097092	6099133	I'm sure they're still figuring it out.
6099213	6100654	Critical Myth, I'm positive, will be there.
6100714	6101474	Bobby will be there.
6101514	6103596	British Invaders went last year, so they'll probably go this year.
6103976	6108138	The only show that probably won't be there, I even think Rama is talking about going.
6108178	6111340	I could be wrong, but he went to Atlanta for something else, so he can go to DragonCon.
6112701	6118724	The only one that I would know would be Girls Gone Wow, and if we can make that happen, then lordy, we will...
6119284	6121726	Fly one of their asses in from the UK if we could.
6122286	6124047	So, that would be fun.
6124067	6125828	Wouldn't you want to party with Syl?
6126488	6129170	I would love for people to send me a ticket so I can go to DragonCon.
6131031	6131972	You can get on a bus.
6132232	6133613	DarkSakura across America.
6136823	6137104	Alright.
6138786	6139747	There you go.
6139927	6141008	Our Fugle Question of the Week.
6141068	6143291	Let's get back into some more news about video games.
6143351	6143611	Loki.
6144552	6144853	Alright.
6146875	6147536	So let's see.
6147656	6148316	Double Fine.
6148336	6153002	You remember they had that wonderful Kickstarter that kind of brought Kickstarter to the forefront?
6153582	6155705	Well, Double Fine Adventures now has a name.
6156085	6161448	Broken Age is a point and click adventure game telling the stories of a young boy and girl leading parallel lives.
6172973	6173113	And, uh...
6193778	6194779	Adventure ensues.
6194879	6196880	That's the most important part, yes.
6197000	6198021	Hijinks occur.
6198882	6204045	If you didn't back the Kickstarter, you can pre-order the game via the website.
6208268	6208749	It looks neat.
6208889	6209649	I don't really know.
6209669	6212171	We'll have to see when the game comes out.
6214451	6215913	Well, a lot of people already bought it.
6216714	6216874	Yeah.
6217074	6225223	It's going to be one of the first games to come out that just... Besides maybe, what, Diablo 3, where they just give a million of them away because people already bought them.
6225644	6226264	Yeah.
6227165	6227466	All right.
6228167	6228487	Anyhow...
6229608	6258451	some updates from Xbox games on demand some reasons why day and date launches don't always make it to games on demand you know there's a big push to try and get games delivered digitally at the exact same time they show up in stores because you know the convenience of downloading them and needing to have that game right now really goes a long way in selling them I know a lot of people bought Luigi's Mansion digitally because it came out right at midnight and a lot of people were like I can't even wait the six hours to get to the store or I guess it's more than six but you know what I mean
6259331	6286100	Anyhow, Eric Jaeger, the senior business manager of Xbox Games On Demand This is why titles don't launch day and date alongside retail releases Quote, we have a lot of strong partnerships with retailers We really need them to do a lot for us They're the ones out there selling the consoles, selling the peripherals And in this time, we're trying to figure out how to fit that into the whole digital landscape shift We're just taking a bit of measured pace with it So very interesting
6287000	6311888	Sort of kind of the converse of what you're seeing with Nintendo That they're actually purposefully giving a little breathing room to the retailers Which is ironic considering those rumors that gained yet again more steam this week We didn't put it on the show roll tonight because it's the same fucking rumor we've heard for a couple months But more stuff out there apparently indicating that Xbox, the new one, will always be online I don't think it's actually going to be online only
6313328	6314389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6330163	6343792	It's incredibly risky to do that because if they're the only company doing that, remember, they have shareholders to answer to and they can't necessarily just go do this thing where, hey, we're going to go ahead and cut out all of the retail marketplace.
6345553	6352397	We're going to sell games digitally only or we're going to basically prevent you from selling your game used and that kind of thing.
6354358	6355740	Here's what they basically said.
6355760	6362791	This is coming from some screenshots of the software development kit on VGLeaks.com.
6363292	6368159	And basically they said... I'm trying to find this exact...
6369638	6373200	Durango will implement different power states so it can be powered on.
6373640	6375420	It will draw minimal electricity, blah, blah, blah.
6375660	6376701	Kind of like the PlayStation 4.
6377581	6381403	It says, with this always-on, always-connected design.
6381443	6383724	But see, that's where everyone's like, oh, always-on, always-connected.
6383984	6392667	They said the console will be ready instantly when users want to play and will maintain a network connection so that the console software and games are always current.
6393147	6403690	I think that always on, always connected means that it's going to have a standby and it's going to download those updates for your games and system updates when it's in standby so you don't have to fucking wait for an update to happen.
6403991	6405351	That makes more sense.
6405511	6412933	So, I mean, this was the same marketing spiel behind WeConnect24, even though obviously that didn't do the system updates and stuff.
6413214	6416014	I mean, the way that reads is an awful lot like they pitched WeConnect24.
6416074	6420376	But see, all these blogging sites and some of these guys that are trying to get these...
6420956	6424077	Headlines, and trust me, I bought into it too until I finally read it.
6424957	6425918	Always on, always connected.
6425958	6427138	Like, oh, there you go.
6427618	6429138	It's got to always be connected to the internet.
6429279	6439121	No, I think if you want to use this feature where your console updates itself in standby so you don't have to wait for these updates and doesn't have to reset and stuff, that's what they mean by this.
6439321	6444243	It's a feature so that, because no one fucking likes waiting for these updates to happen.
6444263	6447504	You're trying to play a game and, oh, I got to wait five minutes for this shit to download.
6448649	6449370	DarkSakura, in the meantime.
6472799	6475502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6492660	6494301	Thank you for watching!
6508773	6524429	and that there's a statement going out that basically, and I really liked this statement here that's by the creative director for Remember Me, Jean-Maxime Morris, said, if you think that, there's no way this medium's going to mature.
6525870	6528273	So it's really a lot of misogyny we need to...
6530259	6533642	Those stats they put out for that Mass Effect 3 panel were pretty eye-opening, though.
6533683	6534063	What was it?
6534183	6538087	Only 18% of players beat it with Female Shepard.
6538307	6541270	But that is, if you'll notice, the loudest part of the fandom.
6542371	6543092	Is that 18%.
6543572	6546656	And honestly, I chalk that up to bros.
6547757	6547977	You know.
6549875	6553539	Kaden is a squad mate less than 2% of the time.
6554561	6555242	I couldn't believe that.
6555262	6556303	That's because he was a whiny bitch.
6557404	6557725	Kidding.
6557845	6560027	So are you, but you've been on 100% of these shows.
6560568	6561689	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
6561729	6562450	Yeah, I've been on more like 95%.
6562490	6562590	Still.
6565590	6582110	but the other thing too is that they almost didn't make Tali playable in Mass Effect 3 which would have been a shame basically enough people were passionate about it that they made her playable but I guess it might have to be why she wasn't even available until like halfway through the game but
6583129	6586191	And I mean, I've been running across people who say, oh, she's so irritating.
6586231	6586771	She's so annoying.
6586811	6588512	It's like, hell, she was great.
6589672	6591994	Even though she's not like a very strong squad mate.
6592594	6601499	I remember reading some story and I don't know if there's something you'd put on Tumblr or where, but that a lot of characters weren't playable in Mass Effect 2 because they didn't want you to get them killed before 3.
6602219	6603441	Well, yeah, that was it, too.
6603941	6609849	They were saying because they were part of, I guess, something that they had had in mind for three.
6610409	6612131	So that's why they didn't have them playable.
6612192	6615576	But still, I think that everybody should have been playable for the last one.
6616195	6618316	There's a lot of stuff that could have gone better about Mass Effect 3.
6618736	6623418	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Some of those PAX East panels weren't broadcast.
6623438	6625599	I hope they post them online like the Bioware one.
6626019	6626500	Me too.
6627140	6628200	I'd love to see that, actually.
6629141	6629441	Yeah.
6630582	6630942	All right.
6631422	6633563	Well, we'll get to the mailbag shortly.
6633683	6635824	Or no, do we get any emails this week?
6637690	6640353	No, just the one that was just more for direction.
6640413	6641274	Are we reading it or no?
6641474	6641935	I guess not.
6642615	6643737	I checked.
6643917	6644558	There's nothing else.
6645118	6647220	Well, shame on all of you guys for not emailing us.
6647241	6648322	Yeah, how dare you.
6648582	6650664	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6650684	6651846	Well, we still have some news stories.
6651866	6653147	Thank you, Cabstropic Moggy.
6653167	6654348	I like Tally as well.
6655449	6656910	All right, we still have some news stories for you guys.
6657650	6657930	Loki.
6658391	6659251	So this is kind of cool.
6659271	6663493	There's a partnership that was announced by Sony and Unity.
6663673	6672477	Basically, the Unity engine will now have ways to port games to the PlayStation platforms, including PlayStation 4, PS3.
6673898	6702579	Vita, and Playstation Mobile and using these I guess it'll be easier to take advantage of different system stuff like the cameras and the touchpads and that kind of stuff, Playstation Network and they say also because of that it'll allow people to port titles easier to iOS and Android as well and I guess there's already some games that have used this including Might and Delight's Pid and Fun Bits Escape Plan
6704577	6706419	Oh, I saw Funbit's escape plan.
6706519	6707500	Oh, that was the build of that game?
6707600	6708520	That's pretty cool.
6708540	6710202	Alright, that was the launch title.
6710963	6711903	Pid and Funbit.
6712384	6712964	Or Pid?
6714225	6714706	What's Pid?
6716465	6746168	I have no idea what PID is but yeah, escape plan looked kind of cool so cool and I know a lot of people use Unity for all sorts of things so porting games will be easier and it sounds like they kind of are embracing indie development a little bit better I think they're finding out that hey, these indie titles that we're bringing over to the Vita and stuff seem to be doing well for us let's get them more involved with other consoles making it easier to get your game on there so I like that
6751655	6754177	Is this something that will be for PlayStation 3 and 4?
6754797	6757379	Yeah, it's all stuff.
6757399	6759601	3, 4, Vita, and mobile.
6759661	6760281	That's pretty cool.
6760501	6766646	Again, with a new console coming out this year, it seems like there's so much still on the PlayStation 3.
6767367	6774693	Yeah, it's kind of hard to sell your next console when there's all this stuff coming to your current console.
6774713	6775093	Yeah.
6776181	6781969	Well, you guys remember Street Fighter X Tekken, you know, and it was okay.
6781989	6786355	I don't think it was as good as a lot of people were hoping it would be.
6786375	6788097	On disc, DLC.
6788177	6790320	That's one of the things that will be remembered for forever.
6790981	6794542	Remember, Street Fighter X Tekken wasn't the only game that was supposed to happen there.
6794562	6802965	There was supposed to be another game, Tekken X Street Fighter, which was Namco's version of the game, basically, as more of a Tekken-style fighter.
6803785	6805065	No news on that in a while.
6805826	6810107	But producer Katsuhiro Harada, responding to a fan on Twitter, said, quote,
6813968	6841591	that's why we don't say anything so a lot of people are speculating that based on that message oh they're going to move it up to PlayStation 4 and the new Xbox as opposed to the current gen which would make a lot of sense it would also kind of give them a chance to really reinvent some things and hopefully make people forget about the fact that they didn't care for Street Fighter X Tekken so can't really see how this is bad news except the fact that it's going to be a little while longer before this game comes out
6842151	6843192	Dark Sakura, any interest?
6843232	6844993	I know you're a fighting girl fan.
6845033	6847795	You are a fighting game girl fan.
6848115	6850236	Are you excited about Tekken Cross Street Fighter?
6851857	6853198	I'm reserving judgment.
6853959	6855039	I'm not going to get it right away.
6856020	6856320	Okay.
6857241	6859242	Unless that trailer comes out and you're like, oh my god.
6859522	6860083	Oh my god, Jin.
6860103	6861304	Oh my god, Ryu.
6862224	6862724	So we'll see.
6862865	6864506	I like even this little teaser image.
6864626	6865406	Ryu looks great.
6865586	6867187	I like him kind of Tekken style.
6867207	6867307	Yeah.
6868348	6875954	Well, I've, you know, I even have to say that I've always been a fan of the Street Fighter characters done in the style of another game.
6875974	6876935	Like, remember SNK?
6877996	6880939	I loved their renditions of the Street Fighter characters.
6881039	6887764	Not on the show roll tonight, but I want to say I heard that CVS2 is supposed to be coming out for PlayStation Classics or something like that.
6888185	6889586	So you can get it on PS3.
6890180	6893001	That would sort of be a big why for me.
6893021	6893782	Because it's awesome.
6893802	6894982	Because I've already got it.
6895262	6895603	Yeah.
6896523	6900185	I would like to see it re-released so you could do like online battles would be pretty cool.
6900545	6901505	For matching service.
6901585	6904047	We need more games that say for matching service in the title.
6904187	6904707	We do need.
6904807	6910990	You know, I've actually got the Vampire Savior for matching service that I forgot completely that we actually owned that game.
6911830	6914792	So I might sell it.
6916593	6919675	Did you ever read Gamer Girl's comment in chat here, Loki, about PID?
6920115	6925278	PID is a side-scroller in which you play a little boy who gets lost and gets put on a planet and has to find his way home.
6925758	6927659	And she gives you a link there to PID.
6928340	6929220	All right.
6929300	6940547	Tigerclaw, following up with the Mass Effect information from earlier, saying, There was some mention about the Mass Effect movie during that panel, but nothing like when it's coming out, because I don't think they've even started it.
6940567	6941568	They haven't even started it yet.
6942168	6942629	You know what?
6942869	6955682	I'd probably see it out of morbid fascination, but I just wouldn't... For me, I am so deeply entrenched into the game playing as a female Shepard that to think of playing it as a guy is inconceivable to me.
6955902	6959125	I really hope somebody puts their foot down and makes it a femme Shep.
6959326	6959966	I can support that.
6960006	6960447	I seriously do.
6960487	6960967	I really do.
6961848	6964731	I think it would be a great character, but...
6965752	6966052	I don't know.
6966433	6972799	I also kind of want them to really fuck with the fandom and do something really atrocious in the game.
6972859	6976563	Like do a decision that like can't even happen in the game.
6977063	6987774	Like have Kayden and Ashley survive Vermeier or like something that just totally like makes fan boys and fan girls just like, what are you doing?
6990627	6991708	I really want that to happen.
6992368	6995529	I want DarkSakura to twitch nervously when she's watching Mass Effect.
6995549	6997510	Honestly, I wouldn't care.
6997530	6998711	I want Garrus to die.
6998751	6999851	No!
7000531	7000912	No!
7001812	7002552	Oh my God, Rob.
7002592	7004233	I can't believe you'd say something so horrible.
7004573	7004993	Okay.
7005053	7005614	I'm done.
7006494	7008195	I'm going to leave right now to get my soda.
7010766	7011086	All right.
7011687	7013388	This is the part where we would do the mailbag.
7013408	7014770	Fuck you.
7015410	7016652	But you didn't email us.
7016752	7019875	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Maybe you should do that for next time.
7020515	7026822	So instead, we'll go right into the FUs of the week, even though this is really not a good time to be doing that, but it is what it is.
7043218	7046720	Um, my, um, I have two FUs really.
7046800	7054423	One of them is to my iPad for not supporting Java so that I can sign up for something that Rob's going to be talking about later.
7056144	7061926	And then, um, my other one goes to this stupid, um, bitch face that, okay, I actually have another one than that.
7062266	7068349	To, um, bitch face number one who was in the car in front of me and one of those homeless guy panhandlers was outside and
7068769	7076854	and she turned on her windshield wipers for the entire period of time that we were at the light and started flinging water at him.
7076974	7079756	And it was clearly on purpose because her car was not dirty.
7080097	7083319	You could see all the way through her windshield and back windshield.
7083359	7084259	She just did it to be a bitch.
7084800	7088902	So I gave him 50 cents and said I apologize on behalf of humanity.
7089643	7090884	Not really, but I did give him money.
7091824	7095887	And then to my former boss bitch face.
7097614	7098615	I don't care if you fuck with me.
7098655	7099456	Don't fuck with my friends.
7101177	7101457	I'm done.
7102118	7102438	Loki.
7104180	7110946	Um, I guess I have to use the fact that my coworker's gone, so I got no one to talk to.
7112948	7113268	Yeah.
7116230	7117712	Fuck my hand for being weak.
7118032	7118593	Thank you, Rob.
7120514	7122576	I opened a bottle for DarkSakura.
7123337	7124438	Because I'm strong.
7126571	7127832	All the pressure builds up inside.
7128652	7130472	And fuck the Mass Effect movie.
7131993	7134754	F you to the freaking wild turkeys in this neighborhood.
7134814	7136094	They're all assholes.
7136675	7142157	Like, one of them literally flew right in front of my car today with a death wish, wanting me to hit it.
7142177	7143577	So I have to slam on the brakes.
7143957	7147098	Thank God there wasn't a car behind me or I probably would have been in an accident.
7147158	7151360	I probably would have gotten whiplash thanks to this stupid fucking turkey that lives near here.
7152080	7153441	So, F you to the turkeys.
7153541	7155042	Why are you so stupid, turkeys?
7155062	7156222	Tell me!
7156442	7162805	Did you know that actually turkeys were rated as one of the most stupid animals to live?
7162985	7166167	Well, thank God we eat so many of them once a year.
7166227	7167988	I wouldn't eat the wild turkeys in this neighborhood.
7168248	7169289	Who knows what the fuck they've been eating.
7169309	7169789	That's true.
7170109	7171530	They probably taste like radiation.
7172290	7174311	Alright, that does it for the FUs of the week.
7174351	7181896	A couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7182576	7183537	But first, a couple stories.
7184377	7197165	So, apparently there has been some research into video games and their effects on kids with dyslexia and actually allowing them to be able to read.
7198946	7221906	and this is kind of cool they did a study basically where they had 20 kids 20 dyslexic children playing Rayman's Raving Rabbids which is crazy as it is for a total of 12 hours over 9 days and of course the game has a ton of crazy mini games and that kind of fun stuff and basically
7223566	7235850	Before and after the nine days of game playing, the researchers tested the kids on several different tasks, including reading speed and accuracy, word recognition, and their ability to pay attention to multiple types of input, sight and sound at once.
7236370	7239811	Before playing the games, the two groups were...
7240951	7250295	Both equivalent in these tasks, but after 12 hours of the games, the kids that played the minigames showed significant improvements in their ability to read.
7250355	7255798	They read faster, more accurately, and they recognized more words than they had before the treatment.
7255838	7261701	Meanwhile, the children that had played non-active minigames didn't do any better on the tasks.
7263021	7264122	So that's kind of neat.
7266591	7270755	I think that's a great story with all the crap that video games get sometimes.
7271115	7275879	I'm glad to hear something where it's bona fide showing that it's helping in a particular scenario here.
7276300	7278582	You know, helping children with this.
7279022	7279463	It's great.
7279603	7283106	It's almost like all those years spent telling mom it improves my hand-eye coordination.
7283146	7284928	Like now there's the science to back it up.
7285828	7314681	but the science has always been there I mean for the sake of reading and this is something actually we learn in typography the human brain will read lowercase letters better than it will read anything that's all caps a good reader reads the shape of the words not the individual letters so doing something that's going to improve time cognition for getting instinctive action over slow and methodical picking it out would definitely I think improve that skill when it comes to actually reading a shape of a word
7315512	7324500	You know, that's really funny because when I was studying broadcast journalism, whenever you look at scripts for TV shows and stuff or the teleprompters, everything's always written in caps.
7325161	7328504	And it's not, you know, everybody makes that joke like, why are you yelling though?
7328784	7331026	But they actually say it's to make you slow down.
7331447	7332788	That's why they write scripts like that.
7333248	7333608	Exactly.
7334369	7336251	Because it's the opposite of what you're saying.
7336691	7337972	I'll say one more thing on the subject.
7339533	7346358	They were doing a study of different types of readers, you know, basically really slow, really low-level readers and then higher-level readers.
7347058	7351902	And they timed blink rates and pause rates for when people were reading.
7352362	7360027	And the slower readers would blink and pause more often, usually in the middle of a word as opposed to at the end of sections of words.
7360507	7360628	So...
7362110	7364512	Ragnarok Online 2 Legend of the Second Music done by Yoko Kanno
7386289	7386709	Really?
7386909	7387129	Yeah.
7387269	7388150	That's awesome.
7389170	7392311	Apparently this game is now finally almost here.
7392391	7395072	It's supposed to be in open beta in mid-April.
7395452	7397073	Pre-registration is available.
7397153	7399113	You can also check it out on the Facebook page.
7400034	7402235	I want to check out this little trailer here in studio.
7402355	7406116	If it goes anything like the last Ragnarok Online, it's going to be in beta for seven years.
7407456	7408117	Most likely.
7411058	7414761	I'm trying to look at, is there any actual gameplay in this video or is it just a bunch of freaking like cut scenes?
7414781	7417522	No, but there's YouTube video from the alpha.
7417883	7421245	Will I get to fight, what were they called, Prinnies?
7421285	7423426	The little slime people?
7423566	7424067	Pourings.
7424367	7424887	Pourings.
7425788	7427429	Oh, Prinnies are the dudes from Disgaea.
7427449	7427809	What am I thinking?
7427829	7430011	Oh my god, the outfits look so awesome.
7430771	7432913	Okay, how long did I play Ragnarok online, Rob?
7433033	7433353	I don't know.
7433393	7434654	How long until they banned you?
7435174	7435874	No, no, no, they didn't.
7435974	7439196	I actually played... Let's put it this way.
7439256	7445459	If I go back and play the International Ragnarok Online right now, I can get all of my characters back and all of my old stuff because I was in the alpha.
7446679	7449120	Because you're a super nerd and you have a badge to prove it.
7449641	7450161	I sure do.
7450861	7454163	Well, let us know if you're able to get in the beta for Ragnarok Online 2 and don't get banned.
7455465	7456426	I've never been banned!
7457747	7458828	You're banned from this show.
7458888	7459249	Get out.
7459809	7463513	I used to be friends with some of the GMs.
7463833	7464834	Shit.
7465755	7469778	We are at the end of our news, so we're going to open up the Skype line.
7470038	7471640	And I'm hoping we're going to hear from some people.
7472040	7473461	that went to PAX East tonight.
7473561	7475463	So we're going to open up the phones and see what happens.
7475483	7478985	1-877-GAME-OLR is the toll-free number you can use to call.
7479446	7482468	Or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
7482808	7488512	But remember, if you do call us on Skype, you want to call Echo123 first just to test your connection.
7488612	7490454	And, oh, phone's already lighting up.
7490514	7491074	We got a call.
7491755	7492715	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7492755	7493116	Who's this?
7493888	7495109	I'm driving recklessly, guys.
7512279	7512539	No.
7512739	7513620	Oh, stupid kids.
7513640	7515020	Oh, about the people cutting through his yard?
7515120	7515420	Yeah.
7515561	7515921	All these kids.
7515941	7519943	And then the kids that decided once I locked it that they needed to teach me a lesson by tearing it down.
7521083	7521383	Fuck them.
7521483	7526866	And then didn't you get it all fixed and then like a little mini tornado took it out anyway or something?
7527266	7528586	They took one of the other signs.
7528666	7531448	The mini tornado took my 99 cent no trespassing sign.
7532228	7533769	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7551280	7551941	Legend of Zaku
7574591	7575351	Legend of Zaku
7601440	7605062	And he's just, he's basically saying, yeah, I'm just chill because I have to work the next morning and everything.
7605102	7608324	But like Friday night, he's like, you know, bouncing off the walls and everything.
7609065	7620731	So I just wanted to give that little insight to OLR that, you know, yeah, he's like, No, he actually does have a personality and it's a good one.
7624269	7624549	All right.
7625710	7627971	So you got to meet a lot of people, right?
7628592	7630353	SSJ100Matt was there, right?
7630533	7631914	I met SSJ100Matt a couple times.
7631954	7633955	I met John from Critical Myth.
7634776	7636377	Met up with him.
7636397	7640219	Met up with Ranma and a bunch of people from the cosplay group that he's in.
7641260	7642320	Anime Jam Session.
7642701	7643581	I got to meet Misty.
7644482	7645943	And HitStun found us.
7646703	7647764	Nice.
7648144	7650225	And met some other people from the community.
7650245	7651006	It was a good time.
7651046	7651886	I didn't get to see Havoc978.
7653688	7657230	I didn't go to the Bring Your Own Computer area all that often, so that's kind of where he hangs out.
7657930	7664594	But just comparing PAX East to PAX Prime, I can see why they're saying that PAX East is the real PAX.
7665535	7667736	Just because that convention center is huge.
7667776	7670278	I don't know if the one you went to was in this convention center.
7670398	7676621	No, I went to the very first one that was at that other convention center downtown that I don't think they have it at anymore.
7676661	7678863	It's the same one that Anime Boston, I think, is at.
7680064	7692232	I think so, yeah, it's the Boston Convention Center, which is, like, really close to the airport, which is great, because I'm so used to, like, in Los Angeles and Seattle, it's, like, a 40-minute cab ride to get from the airport to the convention center.
7692292	7694794	In this one, it's, like, you know, 10 bucks, you know.
7695094	7695834	We had that nice limo ride.
7695854	7696274	We're rock stars.
7696294	7697115	We're taking a limo.
7715459	7720842	Actually, when we did the DDR Freak moderator trip, they sprung for us to get limos from the... Must be nice.
7720982	7722743	It was fun in Las Vegas.
7722763	7727846	Didn't you get to ride the limos for the Windows 7, the Microsoft Windows thing?
7727886	7729647	That was after that PAX.
7729727	7731428	Okay, that was at E3, yeah.
7732188	7734830	And that video we made that never got put on the internet, but whatever.
7735130	7738132	Yeah, they stopped at the one that me and Glenn did.
7738832	7740333	That was the one they stopped at.
7741104	7743590	And they're like, we can send you the raw assets if you want to cut something together.
7743610	7745173	I'm like, no, that's not why we did it.
7747685	7761215	So the thing that's kind of funny is because I did a podcast with the Boston Bastard Brigade and Electric Sisterhood and there was a whole bunch of other podcasters and we did a podcast that's going to be coming out this week sometime.
7762055	7763997	We recorded it this morning at 10 a.m.
7764997	7766879	It was actually a lot of fun being in there.
7766899	7768139	It was a roundtable type podcast.
7768480	7776806	But what struck me as interesting, and they had to cut off the end of the podcast because they were losing that room, was that they were treating this a lot like E3.
7777906	7803025	and they're like what do you think of PAX what games did you play on the show floor and I couldn't get in that I'm like I think they missed the point of PAX I mean the show floor is a big part of it but PAX is so much bigger than that and you know some of the stuff that I saw at PAX that really blew me away was not on the show floor I walked in and this just you know hit my nostalgia bone two things hit my nostalgia bone I walked into one room it's really dark
7803926	7810450	and all it had in there, and I'm not kidding, 16 fully functional Steel Battalions.
7811850	7813411	That sounds awesome.
7813531	7818134	Eight of them were system link with the multiplayer game and then they had four playing the single player.
7818294	7819835	That sounds like my house except I have two.
7822464	7846697	16 all fully functional and they had the one one enforcer who knew everything about the game and he was you know yelling at people kind of like military style and you know giving them you know kind of like the old kind of like the spiel that you would get from like mech core if you're doing the battle tech pods and stuff so that was really neat and then they had the classic console room and they actually did in the corner have like a Commodore 64 awesome with a five and a quarter inch disk drive
7847057	7848098	Yeah, I love it.
7871267	7878721	and that's what sets PAX apart from E3 even though if you listen to most podcasts they're going to concentrate on the E3 aspects of PAX.
7880205	7881846	Nino Cooney Capcom
7910528	7915274	Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, the worst demo I've ever played.
7915374	7917716	Ni No Kuni is no longer the worst demo I've ever played.
7917856	7927207	You were probably still on the plane when we were doing Gaming Week, but I actually mentioned you and that whole thing in Gaming Week because I hated the demo as well.
7927447	7930911	But I have friends that love Monster Hunter, and I'm like, I wouldn't know that from this demo.
7931624	7937107	and so, yeah, I think I landed and you were on the classic game of the week when I got in my car from the airport.
7937267	7938968	Anyway, I'll catch the podcast.
7939488	7946092	So, I learned, okay, they're doing DuckTales and I'm like, they can't mess this up.
7946812	7948253	How can Capcom mess this up?
7948933	7953396	I just, you can't, I mean, it was perfect and stuff.
7953716	7955157	You want to know how Capcom messed this up?
7955357	7957018	They let the Pink Palace developers do it.
7957907	7958327	No, no, no.
7958387	7959748	Here's how they messed it up at PAX.
7959968	7960168	How?
7960628	7963210	There was only one copy of the game in the entire city of Boston.
7965071	7967572	One copy on one single kiosk.
7967632	7969213	It's a seven minute demo.
7971254	7975957	The line went around the corner of the booth and they had to cap it because it was already four hours long.
7978240	7978880	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8000029	8000789	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8024040	8030206	And so I was up there, and I asked the lady from Capcom, and I'm like, so why do you only have one kiosk of that?
8030306	8031567	And she shot me this look.
8032528	8035771	Like, oh my god, I wish you had not asked that question.
8035811	8038634	And this is like an hour after they had unveiled that side of the booth.
8038674	8039915	It was covered up until the panel.
8040836	8044399	And so in order to save her, I was like, is that the million dollar question?
8044439	8046801	She's like, that's the five million dollar question.
8046821	8047382	Yeah.
8048317	8050398	So they knew.
8050899	8055762	I think when everybody started singing in that panel, I think they realized they messed up only bringing one copy of the game.
8056182	8059745	I think it's because it's running on dev kits and they only have minimum amounts of dev kits.
8059785	8066529	That's exactly my thought because remember, GDC is happening literally, what, tomorrow or Tuesday?
8066549	8067670	Yeah, it starts Tuesday.
8067910	8071993	Yeah, when GDC starts, all the dev kits are probably in San Francisco.
8072333	8073554	They can't be in two places at once.
8073574	8075135	No, Rob, Passover starts tomorrow.
8075976	8076316	Anyway...
8076556	8081078	But what they could have done is since nobody's touching that stupid Dungeons & Dragons game, make that DuckTales.
8081418	8082698	That's not stupid!
8082898	8090361	Put on the last stage, you know, cover up the Dungeons & Dragons with like a really, you know, crude notebook paper and, you know, Sharpie saying DuckTales.
8092101	8095584	and just do that and then that four hour wait would have been a two hour wait.
8096685	8101690	Then you get the one dude come by, where's Dungeons and Dragons?
8101850	8103651	I heard there was a Dungeons and Dragons game, I want to play it.
8103851	8108535	Dude, okay, the Dungeons and Dragons game is awesome and I probably would have played that if everyone else was over at DuckTales.
8109917	8111418	Yeah, you could have walked right up to play that one.
8113209	8133896	but then there's the long line of everybody trying to watch DuckTales and what does it say about I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing so this is an open question what does this say about PAX in terms of game announcements considering this was not the only game announced there that the most excited people got over an announcement at PAX was a remake of an NES game
8135077	8135437	IndieCulture
8157863	8159765	Indie Games All these crazy ideas I actually played on an Ouya
8177449	8178590	Oh my gosh, they exist.
8179170	8179791	It exists.
8180091	8181252	The controller is terrible.
8183713	8190558	It's unresponsive, but I actually played a game that actually makes use of that touchpad in a way that makes sense.
8191198	8193119	You know, in the same touchpad that's going to be on the PlayStation 4.
8193260	8195221	The game I played there is a Saturday morning RPG.
8195901	8202426	It's an 8-bit kind of turn-based RPG, but with a lot of like, you know, like some of the minigames in there, you're playing Simon and...
8203166	8204026	You know, stuff like that.
8204046	8207027	It's about, like, basically Saturday morning cartoons are this kid's real life.
8207967	8210888	But right before each battle, you scratch off stickers.
8211548	8214289	And that's what you use the touchpad for.
8214509	8214749	Oh.
8214849	8216270	You act like you're scratching off a sticker.
8216790	8217030	Huh.
8217950	8220811	So, it was a neat game, and it's actually a launch title for the Ouya.
8221751	8222672	So I played that a little bit.
8223072	8226193	And the buttons on the Ouya controller, it's O-U-Y-A.
8227113	8227513	Of course.
8228467	8229948	And so it's like, press O to do this.
8230008	8234930	So I press what winds up being the A button on the controller because that's the circle button on the PlayStation controller.
8235711	8237111	It's going to take some getting used to.
8237131	8239993	And even the developer said, I don't like the button placement.
8240733	8242494	I don't like the way they did that.
8242514	8244415	They should have been some kind of standard or something.
8245396	8246056	But I did play that.
8246296	8251259	But there were some other neat things that I saw that I wasn't able to get interviews with.
8251479	8256601	For the hardcore of the hardcore, I'm talking like, I don't know if Dungeon Buster's in chat because this is up his alley.
8256682	8257422	He is in chat.
8257742	8258623	Okay, he is in chat.
8258824	8260366	Dungeon Busters, this is straight up your alley.
8260926	8261828	The game's called Artemis.
8263041	8291876	and this is a spacecraft simulator in the sense like the old Star Trek so imagine the Enterprise except it's multiplayer across PC, iPad, iPhone I think even Android and you are basically a crew member and so what they had set up they had them on laptops there and they had five stations you have your captain, your science officer your engineering officer, your navigation and your weapons guy
8293197	8294718	and you're all cross-talking.
8294798	8299481	You have your screen and the way they had it set up there is you had your screen that had like a radar and things you could do.
8299821	8305245	Then they had a main screen that actually had the 3D render of what it was doing and they were all talking to each other.
8305305	8308027	Okay, turn the ship to 160 degrees.
8308667	8309047	Get close.
8309087	8310808	Okay, comm officer, request docking.
8311169	8318894	Comm officer will say, okay, we've got permission to dock and then the navigation perk guy would actually dock with the station and then battle stuff.
8318914	8320775	They would look at, okay, when do I turn on the shields?
8321255	8348371	and the captain would start yelling out orders and it's this social game where basically all of you are working together to fly the spaceship have space battles and I guess deliver cargo and stuff it was amazingly interesting I didn't get a chance to play it because it was a 20 minute demo so it was kind of hard to get in on it but that's actually out now and here's the thing about Artemis is that they don't like DRM
8349144	8349945	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8359731	8387394	and they don't check for this so this is honor system but then you can send the game to five of your buddies as long as they're all flying on your ship so only one person has to buy the game for five people to fly the ship and play the game that's pretty cool it's kind of like a DS title where like everybody can download from the one person I don't know kind of it's kind of what I'm thinking of when you say that that's really cool so that was one of the games that I saw another game that a lot of people were probably talking about I don't know if you ever heard of this game called dive kick
8389629	8390090	Yes.
8391410	8394092	This is the most complex fighting game ever.
8395353	8397834	It's coming out for PlayStation 3 and Vita and stuff like that.
8397975	8402257	The way they had it there was that they actually had an arcade style controller.
8402738	8403718	There are two buttons.
8404519	8407020	Dive and kick.
8407120	8409782	You select your character and there were five characters in the game.
8410002	8414145	One of them is kind of funny because the name of the character was Wolverine.
8414685	8415766	They got a cease and desist letter.
8416386	8418588	The name of that character is now redacted with a strike through it.
8421200	8428166	So basically, in dive kick, it's the standard thing, and you have the little guy go, Okay, ready?
8428426	8429047	Dive kick!
8429467	8434211	And then you can jump with the dive button, and then kick with the kick button.
8434391	8435632	Or if you just hit the kick button, you dive.
8436033	8439396	And it's basically, whoever hits the other person first, it's a one-shot kill.
8440757	8445721	Even though it shows all these health bars at the stop, but it's a one-hit thing, and you're basically just jumping and diving, and that's all you're doing.
8446876	8450610	and it is the most hilarious, funny fighting game I've ever played.
8452625	8455686	So it sounds like you saw a lot of gems, really, like these little indie gems.
8455766	8457047	I did not see a bad game.
8458027	8458447	That's good.
8458908	8459848	I did not see a bad game.
8459968	8463429	Even in the card game, board game section, I did not see a bad game.
8463889	8477795	Because there was like, it was, the area was probably just as big as the video game section, but they had the whole tabletop section and the entire perimeter of the tabletop section were vendors and people showing off tabletop games, you know, board games, card games, things like that.
8477955	8478175	Wow.
8479137	8499831	and that was in there and that's where I actually played a game that I actually did buy a card game called Flame War which triggered my PTSD of the G4 forums thing because you're playing as a forum moderator trying to create threads, forum threads and then closing them but the way that you attack other players is you flame on their threads and all the cards have internet memes on them
8500887	8512895	and stuff and so I did buy it and you know one of the cards is the Banhammer and so people that were around in the G4 days they actually were selling a shirt of the Banhammer which was basically a hammer that said Ban in it and yes I did buy that shirt.
8512915	8513776	Of course you have to.
8514456	8518459	I have the Banhammer shirt so anybody that remembers me from the G4 days will appreciate that.
8518519	8519620	That is amazing.
8520240	8522201	and some of the others.
8522442	8527605	Obviously, you say PAX is a lot more than just the expo floor, the community and all that.
8527985	8529966	I saw some pictures on Facebook.
8529986	8532708	It looks like you guys were up very late playing Cards Against Humanity.
8533449	8539332	Yes, and that was pretty much like... At DragonCon, I'm used to seeing people in a circle playing Are You a Werewolf?
8539392	8541494	And here, everybody was playing Cards Against Humanity.
8542875	8546237	Because they released the third expansion, which sold out on Saturday.
8547507	8572357	but they also had these three Pax East exclusive packs that you could get and if you found them you got them and they were either in the swag bag or if you went to the Kickstarter room you could get it from them and they were handing them out so yeah Cards Against Humanity was huge at Pax a lot of people were playing that everywhere that you looked wow so I think that game took off
8573559	8575360	I think that's a Kickstarter success story right there.
8575580	8578902	Probably street passed with about 11 billion people.
8579362	8585205	Yes, I would have street passed with more if I kept at it, but I wound up filling all my pieces and completing Find Me.
8586026	8586526	Wow.
8587226	8594070	But I now have, I think, over 1,000 street passes total, and that's from all the E3 and all the other stuff that I've done with it.
8594170	8596411	I'm only up to 500, and I thought I had a ton.
8596911	8601054	Well, you can see I thought I had a ton too, and then I was sitting next to somebody when I went into the rock band panel.
8601174	8601354	Mm-hmm.
8602114	8605637	Which is the only panel I went to, which was the behind the scenes, they named names and everything.
8605657	8606238	It was awesome.
8606638	8607599	It's never going to be broadcast.
8608440	8610782	But I was sitting there and he had like 2,800.
8611863	8615146	And I remarked on it and he just looked at me and he's like, I'm a cast member at Disney World.
8615786	8616246	That's great.
8620074	8628459	Oh yeah, and so the Rock Band panel was, you're never going to see it broadcast because they actually spent about 10 minutes saying, you know, we could get in so much trouble if you, you know.
8628739	8632241	And they're looking right at like the IGN and the Polygon guys in the front row with their laptops out.
8632822	8634703	And they kept looking and they're like, don't write this.
8634963	8636904	Please don't write this because they actually were naming names.
8637224	8637765	Wow.
8637905	8641367	And talking about, you know, here's what, here's where we fucked up.
8642318	8642798	Pearl Jam Rock Band
8667277	8690824	but they actually showed video of concept video of that and how it was going to be about the Pearl Jam live experience because Pearl Jam is a very active bootlegging culture and live video so they were actually putting it around their and the video in the background was actually going to be video footage from a lot of these concerts iconic Pearl Jam concerts and it just for whatever reason it didn't work out and they then coughed and said Eddie Vedder
8694005	8696108	but then they talked about yes we know you want Mews
8697392	8725808	and they basically kind of explain how Muse something happened and that's why they don't have Muse they actually talked about Pink Floyd and actually how they made concept video of doing dreamscape type of stuff with Pink Floyd tracks the Beatles Pink style stuff and they actually had concept art that they sent off to Pink Floyd and it just didn't ever happen same Led Zeppelin also had a little bit of that they had some stuff like that and then they talked about the Guns N' Roses debacle and this is kind of the highlight of this
8726508	8741781	was where apparently there was a leaked video that came out or a viral video that went out of an unnamed Harmonix employee, which everybody tried to name, saying, hey, we got the entire Guns N' Roses library, Appetite for Destruction, everything, and we're going to do this and this and this and this.
8742691	8743332	Dan Rickert Game Informer
8758155	8764117	is the person who actually made that video and made Harmonix's life a living hell for several months.
8777981	8781423	No, but I did get to because I do know both Nick Chester and John Drake.
8781763	8784324	And I went up to see both of them during the show.
8784364	8788546	And I didn't ask them what they were working on because I knew they couldn't tell me about that.
8789046	8790927	And I asked them, will I think it's cool?
8790967	8793408	And I told them, hey, I've been with you guys since Frequency Days.
8793508	8794468	And John looked at me.
8794488	8795809	He's like, you will find this cool.
8797065	8798466	You will find what we're doing cool.
8798487	8800889	We're hoping to announce it at E3.
8800949	8802871	He's like 95% sure.
8802891	8804493	He doesn't want to say anything more than that.
8805253	8809177	But I told him, yeah, I was with you in the frequency and amplitude days and all that stuff.
8809197	8816385	And he's like, it's not Rock Band, but considering what I like of Harmonix's past, he says, I will think that what they're coming up with is cool.
8816965	8818087	And he's very excited about it.
8818127	8819448	And that's all I could get out of him.
8820782	8828845	Well Bobby, it sure sounds like we missed a heck of a show I'm sad, but you know, it is what it is But anything else about PAX East you want to share with us?
8830057	8858355	I got a whole ton of interviews I am going to be probably putting them out on my podcast or some of them on my podcast feed because I don't want to because if I did like one a week every week they would go until like June Tell me more about Saints Row 4 Well I did see Saints Row 4 and I'm going to break this news I told Rob about this because now Deep Silver is handling Saints Row 4 I have a very good relationship with Deep Silver
8860334	8863755	So a THQ never gave me the time of day, but Deep Silver did.
8864195	8871637	And they were showing Saints Row 4 to the press in the hotel that's connected to the convention center instead of having to wait in line.
8872057	8876458	And also that way they weren't bumping people out of the line, bumping attendees.
8876478	8877759	They had press in a different area.
8878719	8902372	and so I went in there and it's the same video the same 10 minute video that they were showing everybody else and they had developers in there and they're like yeah interviews and stuff you know do interviews so I went up to our PR contact her name is Stephanie Shop she is amazing and I went up and Stephanie Shop also if you listen to my show she was responsible for getting the MechWarrior online and the Devolver digital and all those interviews the ones I did kind of in November
8903352	8905053	She was responsible for setting all those up.
8906774	8910875	And I was like, hey, so can I get an interview with one of the Saints Row guys, the developers?
8910975	8912976	And she looked at me and said, no, you can't.
8914397	8916357	And I'm like, okay.
8916518	8920999	And she's like, because I'd rather you do one of your long-form Skype interviews in a couple weeks with them.
8923100	8923460	Ah, nice.
8923480	8924221	Very nice.
8924261	8931804	Because it would be a five to ten minute quickie interview there, and she's like, I'd rather you do one of your long-form ones with these guys.
8931824	8932204	Awesome.
8932967	8934288	So you don't have a date yet though, right?
8934368	8934748	But soon.
8934888	8935408	No date.
8935428	8937810	Well, because she's heading off to GDC.
8937850	8940731	So I'm not bugging her until after GDC.
8940811	8941311	Sure, sure.
8941812	8944373	But she said she does want to do it in the next couple weeks.
8944673	8945754	So it could be pretty soon.
8946334	8946754	Awesome.
8947374	8950016	Well, it sounds like you made a lot of great connections at PAX East.
8950036	8950876	You had a really good time.
8950916	8952357	Making us all jealous we didn't go.
8953578	8956579	But hey, there's DragonCon and E3 hopefully.
8956599	8958360	You're going to have a great time at DragonCon.
8958400	8960041	We are going to have a great time at DragonCon.
8960081	8961302	No, I'm seriously looking forward to it.
8961382	8961882	It's going to be great.
8964757	8966598	I probably do have more stories.
8966638	8968178	I saw a lot of other great indie games.
8968458	8971099	Some that weren't even on the show floor that I got to see.
8971639	8975240	Those interviews are going to be airing throughout the next couple weeks.
8975460	8977801	We're going to be getting some review copies of those.
8979141	8982442	It's a good time to be a gamer.
8982642	8983482	Shut up with the hate.
8985001	8991628	Of all the stuff, I did not see a single bad game, even looking through all the indie stuff.
8991769	8993971	I did not see a single bad game.
8994411	8999677	Transistor, I think that's the Supergiant games from Bastion.
9001819	9004082	If you want to know what my game of show is, it's that.
9004582	9005003	That's it.
9006007	9006587	Thanks for watching!
9028092	9028132	S.J.
9028152	9030153	100 Matt says his girlfriend agrees with you.
9030293	9031374	Transistor's the game of the show.
9031414	9033936	Didn't the talking sword thing happen in a Mercedes Lackey novel?
9054412	9055353	It actually did.
9055413	9058416	I think it's distant enough that it's all right.
9058616	9061559	Well, Bobby, I know you're going to have plenty to say on the next episode of your show.
9061719	9066964	I can't imagine there's a person listening to this that doesn't know about your show, but just in case, please plug away.
9067674	9075582	I am the opening band, not the band that you came to see, but I'll only be here for five or six songs and then I'll go away.
9077064	9079447	An hour before OLR, 8 p.m.
9079507	9080327	Eastern, 5 p.m.
9080368	9081569	Pacific on Sunday nights.
9082810	9088776	Usually it's me doing a monologue for 30 minutes, taking calls from Breakman for another 20 minutes, and then talking to you guys for 10 minutes.
9089597	9093838	and that's my show and we've got a lot of great interviews coming up.
9094259	9100541	A game book being put into iPad, an old style 80s game book, Steve Jackson's Sorcery.
9101681	9105922	It plays like an Infocom text adventure as well but looks really great.
9105942	9106803	We're going to talk to them.
9108083	9111044	An iPad brawler that does not use virtual controls.
9112000	9141353	and it plays more like Fruit Ninja and it actually does work I do get to talk to Phoenix Online Studios with Cognition and the Silver Lining and the next game that they're doing with Jane Jensen I got to talk to Mommy's Best Games about guns, on top of guns and on top of guns Nathan Fouts, he's also been on Fox News a lot recently and we talk about why that happened and what he thinks of that so there's a lot of great content that I've got in my suitcase that is still locked up and sitting in the hallway because I ran in here
9141613	9143074	Alright Bobby, go unpack.
9143094	9145034	We're going to let you go so we can get a couple more calls.
9145115	9147015	But thanks so much for spending some time with us tonight.
9147576	9148236	No problem.
9148276	9152998	And remember, if Legend of Zaku calls in and he's all like, that's not him.
9153918	9154699	It's really a funny guy.
9154719	9155279	It's an act.
9155979	9156599	It's an act.
9158580	9163044	All right, Bobby Blackwolf Show, calling out the OLR regulars tonight.
9163765	9165146	All right, have a good one, Bobby.
9165706	9166087	Take care.
9166227	9166908	Take care, bye.
9167928	9169570	The one and only Bobby Blackwolf, everybody.
9169910	9172512	We let him go a little long tonight, but you know what?
9172873	9173233	It was good.
9173713	9176035	I'm excited to hear from some people that were at PAX East.
9176075	9179659	He always has us on our show, or he always has us on his show, so...
9180239	9182700	It's the least we can do, and he has a lot of great info from the floor.
9183000	9187302	I'm hoping we'll get some more PAX East-related calls, like maybe this next one that's coming in right now.
9187742	9188682	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9188702	9189082	Who's this?
9189662	9190923	Hey, it's Legend of Zaku here.
9191083	9192984	Well, were your ears burning?
9193004	9194884	Because someone was just talking about you.
9195364	9199246	Yeah, I heard it in the car right over.
9199266	9204568	I heard it right as the car was pulling up to my house.
9204768	9206328	So, Zaku, is it all an act?
9206809	9207649	Is this all an act?
9208530	9216752	Maybe, but I'm just going to sidebar and focus on the real task at hand, which was PAX East.
9217732	9222713	Alright, well let's talk about the real reason why you called tonight, PAX East.
9222993	9225174	So you were obviously at the show too, because you met Bobby.
9225534	9226054	How was it?
9226074	9228054	I was rooming with him, actually.
9228294	9228794	Were you really?
9228814	9229574	How awesome.
9229814	9233935	But then it got shifted when we got into the other hotel.
9233975	9236596	I'm not going to say as to the reasons why, but...
9238467	9241349	He knows it very well, and we'll leave it at that.
9241709	9251337	But long story short, this PAX, the way I put it, it was average.
9251697	9259303	Last year's PAX, amongst all the swag and the parties, it doesn't hold a candle.
9260363	9265908	Case in point, Curse's PAX East party this year wasn't even open bar.
9266920	9272443	and they oversold it to the point where you only had one free drink and then everything else you had to pay at the cash bar.
9272743	9278366	The economy is really... Sons of bitches closing the open bar?
9278646	9280086	That's why I came to this thing.
9283388	9284088	You know what though?
9284308	9285349	Perfectly legit.
9285549	9288711	Pax East, not as good because they closed the open bar this year.
9288891	9289291	Fuck them.
9291530	9301994	That is true, and then, you know, it was surprising aside from trying my best to play some of these things, given the fact that there were lines just about everywhere.
9302934	9305135	So I only got to play very few things.
9306155	9309076	I was able to get Hawken, you know, play that game.
9309236	9320960	I also tried out the NVIDIA Shield, the new handheld controller device that they have, which is kind of nifty, though, because it's using the latest version of Android.
9322315	9327800	The latest one that you see on a Nexus 4 and the latest tablets, that's exactly the one they're running.
9329121	9334366	It really feels like a top-tier device.
9335206	9344835	I'm not just bullshitting or anything, I'm just saying it also has touchscreen, but it feels like you're actually playing a recent current-gen console.
9350177	9352678	The graphics are on par.
9352698	9359480	They're like 360 graphics from launch titles.
9359560	9368423	It's gotten to the point where mobile's pretty much at or tailing right now the big boy consoles.
9370804	9373425	You talked about a lot of these lines for games.
9373485	9374645	Did you wait in any of them?
9375025	9377006	Did you stand in that epic line to play DuckTales?
9378101	9379282	No, that's the thing.
9379342	9385245	It's like I was just going around the con, around the expo hall.
9385926	9390409	I did my best to try to score as much free swag as possible, but yeah, it was slim pickings this year.
9391089	9392210	You're a fan of free stuff.
9392250	9394931	I wouldn't be able to guess from your talk about the curse party.
9395191	9398754	Well, okay, what fun nightlife did this PAX East have?
9398814	9399134	Anything?
9400405	9416436	Um, I mean, most of the nightlife was either, you know, you went to the local bars near the hotels, which was like the day before the con, which is a pub crawl that basically stayed in one place because it took too long.
9417429	9436997	But other than that, it was just like whatever you had in your room, if you had Cards Against Humanity, you were basically playing not only with your roommates, with your bunkmates, but with random strangers that would just like bring bottles of high-end liquor, like Johnny Walker, like a liter of Johnny Walker for that table.
9438038	9440098	And I was like, we're taking big swigs of it.
9440579	9443120	And as a result, I had to nurse a hangover this morning.
9444159	9445041	I was just about to ask.
9445261	9450229	I was going to say, you know, your eyes are looking a little bit like you haven't slept in about four days.
9451071	9453795	No, it's like I puked this morning, so yeah.
9453815	9454236	Yeah.
9457200	9460081	I was going to say you have that sort of prize fighter look about you.
9460741	9465403	Like, I wasn't going to say he got in a fight, but he definitely has that whole, like, I had a hell of a weekend.
9465423	9472526	My face was just crunching up, tightening up because I was lurching over the toilet trying to puke.
9472546	9475247	Were you offering your sacrifices to the porcelain goddess?
9477047	9478348	Porcelain goddess, yes.
9479008	9480748	Sacrificing my dignity.
9483978	9493945	Aside from the newer games that were out and the fact that they were just like... Aside from the lines and everything else, board games were pretty much another...
9494878	9512524	another huge aspect of it it got to the point where I actually have gotten my girlfriend I know, well for those who probably can't see the camera but that's our weekend Spartacus Spartacus is that based on the TV show?
9513184	9515305	yes how much full frontal is in the board game?
9516805	9518486	how much full frontal is in the board game?
9519606	9524128	none I know my girlfriend would be disappointed yeah
9525077	9529900	That's all she watches it for, full frontal, and then her dad watches along with her for the boobs.
9531662	9533062	That's kind of awkward, but alright.
9534443	9548253	Yeah, I mean, everywhere, like, yeah, board games, like, it got to the point where it was like, at this point it's like, a good third board games, another third indie...
9549935	9553897	or more importantly, probably like a quarter indeed, and then everything else.
9554497	9556678	I'm still waiting for Mass Effect Risk.
9557058	9558699	Let me ask you one more question, Zaku.
9558739	9566402	Since you say you weren't as big on PAX East this year as you were last year, what can PAX 2014 learn from this year?
9567002	9572004	How can PAX East 2014 set up to be the most kick-ass one yet, besides open bars?
9573044	9573345	All right.
9575051	9581523	I guess it's the panels that I tried my best to actually go to.
9582445	9587414	This year I did better in the fact that I did like one, two, three, four.
9588114	9591416	I think I did like six panels, one of which I had to duck out because of my hangover.
9591456	9594577	But yeah, it's gotten better.
9595658	9597418	The content has gotten a lot better.
9597579	9600100	Obviously, it still packs up pretty badly.
9600900	9604602	Obviously, the Bioshock panel fills up rather quickly.
9604762	9605182	Of course.
9605362	9610185	But it's just like trying to... I guess they can't please everybody.
9611145	9615647	So the best they could do is stay where they are because their venue is...
9618041	9618481	and many more.
9632802	9633282	The only thing about...
9655495	9668771	The only cool thing about PAX this year was the classic gaming had, well, aside from having the standard setup, like one room dedicated to just classic gaming consoles, they had another one.
9668811	9670493	It had a featured room.
9671013	9672896	And this year's feature was Steel Battalion.
9673136	9674017	Like, they had 12 of these.
9674097	9674638	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9676035	9678856	Just playing Steel Battalion is not even fun.
9678896	9679536	It's just work.
9680517	9687239	Cockpit, start up the Mac's computer, do systems check, ignition.
9687439	9690141	Next time it needs to come with some vodka, it'll be a whole lot better.
9690681	9690961	All right.
9692501	9694362	Zaku, I got to let you go so we can get more calls.
9694402	9695683	But thanks so much for the report.
9695863	9700785	And I'm glad to hear at least you had a decent enough time so that you were regretting it this morning.
9702148	9707830	Yeah, also they were giving away free Android Bluetooth controllers for Android-owned users.
9708091	9708611	Where's mine?
9708791	9709071	All right.
9709431	9710892	All right, Zaku, got to let you go, buddy.
9711132	9711532	Take care.
9711552	9714313	Okay, bye.
9714373	9716554	Props to Zaku, an OLR gold store.
9716934	9717575	A gold store?
9717855	9718775	Well, he can have a whole store.
9719155	9724418	A gold star for Zaku for doing a video call so we can actually see the Spartacus game that he bought.
9724858	9725298	Good times.
9725698	9734745	Alright, we'll see if anybody else wants to call 1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio Making us all jealous we weren't there You alright?
9735545	9737506	I just saw something terrifying What's that?
9737967	9747634	A goblin shark That does sound terrifying They have retractable jaws Much less terrifying in this next phone call Hi!
9747954	9749055	Hello, what's up?
9749135	9750616	You're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9751584	9780396	Catastrophic Moggy Nice to meet you I'd never get through You never get through, well you're here now Yay Hold on, the clock on the wall behind you 3.52 in the morning Yes Told you it was going to stay up for us I did say to DarkSakura I would We usually do our chatting when it's 4 in the morning for me And here you are, well what's up?
9781681	9795049	I was going to complain about region locking and how I'm so unexcited by the current news about consoles, but I thought, you've already had so much time, I thought I'd bring up something from weeks ago.
9795490	9796851	Sure, go for it.
9799292	9804315	The last, oh, pardon me, sorry, I'm completely fumbling over my words now.
9804415	9805516	That's alright, I do it all the time.
9806956	9809097	Yeah, we have to listen to three hours of it.
9810677	9811077	Hey!
9812577	9813718	I get to make fun of me.
9813818	9814078	Me.
9815338	9827041	Weeks ago, you were talking, I can't remember what it was about, about your other halves guesting on OLR.
9828241	9834042	And I thought, for either your last episode... Go on.
9836992	9837613	Go off, go!
9838394	9843999	For your last episode, you should, um... He's on the internet!
9844560	9844880	Yes.
9845921	9846502	Where is it?
9846602	9848784	It's four in the morning.
9848804	9849765	Shh, quiet.
9850326	9860136	For your last episode, you should have, um... Oh, for your E3 special, you should have the other half special with Alan, Dan, and, um... Nellie.
9860822	9866704	Nelly, pardon, and with your mum being a guest correspondent.
9866924	9868084	That would be hilarious.
9868104	9870685	We've talked about them before, and I'm sure Dan and Alan would be down.
9870745	9875666	It would just be about convincing Nelly that it's a really funny idea, but that might be difficult.
9875746	9877547	Nelly would probably punch my husband.
9877567	9880967	And then I'd have to be here to see that.
9880987	9882568	You'd have to video it.
9884252	9885593	Yes, it would have to be a video thing.
9885633	9885933	I don't know.
9886253	9895799	Maybe the only way I could see that happening is if we promised Nellie it was the last episode of the show ever because she'd be like, yay, Matt can have a life now.
9895819	9901682	Yeah, you should do it either for the last episode or for an E3 special.
9903379	9904300	We'll see, we'll see.
9904400	9906782	It'd be like we couldn't be bothered to show up, so our spouses do it.
9907222	9910765	So, we've had a bunch of people calling in to talk about PAX East tonight.
9910906	9914128	Obviously, you're a little far away, so I'm imagining you didn't make it to PAX East.
9914549	9916611	But what do you think about everything you're hearing?
9917391	9920154	Honestly, I've not heard much news from PAX East.
9920174	9922376	Most of what I've heard is from you.
9924077	9927080	My biggest reaction is I wish DuckTales was coming to PC.
9928613	9931696	I have a policy of not getting digital content on consoles.
9937774	9938675	I can see why.
9938715	9939595	You know what though?
9940536	9945619	One time when you can't, it won't transfer over and at least with physical stuff you can trade it in.
9945639	9947760	With digital stuff, he's stuck with it for now.
9948101	9953964	If it does well enough though, if it does well enough, they'll put it on disk.
9954084	9957747	If it's going to be on Xbox though, it shouldn't be that hard to port it to PC.
9958928	9959468	I hope so.
9959528	9964271	Anyway, I've taken up too much of your time so I'll get off now.
9964797	9965298	No worries.
9965358	9967339	It's a pleasure to hear from you and to get to see you.
9967819	9970181	And I know you got to shut up because people are trying to sleep.
9970481	9973583	But thank you for breaking all the rules in your household to call us tonight.
9974383	9977245	I'm getting shut up tonight.
9977846	9978246	Bye.
9978286	9978586	Bye.
9978706	9979507	Bye.
9980507	9982188	We got someone in trouble.
9982208	9985230	We got someone in trouble.
9985851	9987572	All right.
9987592	9991895	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9994502	9995443	That was a great call though.
9996685	9997226	It's true though.
9997266	10001151	I usually, because I'm up around like four in the morning and usually that's right when he's on.
10001913	10004977	So we end up chatting like about stuff.
10006011	10010474	Bobby and Actdeft in our chat room talking a little bit about the DuckTales on PC thing.
10011154	10016897	Actdeft was convinced it was coming to PC and BlackWolf says his sources say it's a possibility eventually.
10017398	10018358	Not at launch though.
10018618	10023741	After all, Resident Evil 6 I think just or is about to come out on Steam.
10024042	10027544	Sometimes PC's a little bit later so just hold out guys.
10027584	10028104	It might happen.
10028424	10029345	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10029365	10029685	Who's this?
10030888	10035231	Hey, hey, hey, it's Anime Jam Session calling live from the mobile Jersey Mobile.
10035291	10036632	Holy crap, it's all of you guys.
10036652	10037612	I hope you're not driving.
10039013	10040234	No, I'm driving.
10040494	10046838	Okay, okay, I was going to say, because if Ranchan had been the one driving, we would have hung up.
10047859	10050140	Just because you do not talk on your phone and drive.
10050360	10051641	I do it all the time, don't listen to me.
10051661	10053582	Yeah, and you're going to kill somebody, namely a turkey.
10053602	10054503	No, I'm not, no, I'm not.
10054583	10054743	What?
10057441	10060343	Alright, enough of DarkSakura's lecturing.
10060904	10062545	You guys are coming back from PAX East.
10062585	10063385	Did you have a good time?
10064406	10065127	Yes, yes, yes.
10065167	10076235	And I would like to let you know that as Executive Vice Chair of VOGCon East 2013, we went over attendance capacity with the special guest of Cards Against Humanity.
10076615	10083020	We went to a total of 16 guests with special guest stars Johnny Walker Redd.
10084243	10084904	Now, wait a minute.
10085324	10089366	We've had two other callers so far tonight from VOG at PAX East.
10089386	10091607	You're the first one to mention this con.
10091667	10093628	What exactly ended up happening?
10098311	10098671	Hello?
10099311	10099872	Are we losing them?
10101112	10101512	What was that?
10101552	10102993	We're kind of breaking in and out here.
10103113	10103814	That's okay.
10103834	10104874	What ended up happening at this VOG con?
10111317	10115198	Let's see, JoeVidea did alcohol bingo.
10116959	10120999	Zaku went game over because he drank not as much as everybody else.
10123660	10129382	And we did game plus inception equals game-ception.
10129742	10130742	You don't say.
10132002	10132342	Yes.
10133082	10134623	Yeah, we were playing a dice game.
10134743	10139484	The rules of the game were roll dice, make up rule, drink.
10141755	10142976	Those are the rules of the game.
10143436	10143736	Yes.
10144997	10145817	Patent pending.
10148099	10151140	The name of the game is called Game.
10153342	10156764	How many minutes were you sober during PAX East?
10158285	10159225	Just a bit.
10159725	10161066	More or less, yeah.
10161727	10165129	Alright, what did you guys see on the show floor that kicked ass?
10165169	10166289	Did you see anything out there?
10166409	10170952	Or even if it wasn't on the show floor, like in a side room or a panel or whatever, what did you see that kicked ass?
10173973	10177856	DuckTales Did you actually wait in that hideous line to play it?
10178096	10179657	Hell no!
10179997	10184140	No, DuckTales is one of those games where I will be buying it regardless.
10184540	10185961	Yeah, that's true.
10186001	10188943	You don't need a demo to sell you, huh?
10189463	10189603	Nope.
10189763	10191904	I will say this, though.
10192845	10196447	Twitch TV was having a giveaway for the DuckTales poster.
10196627	10200010	They wanted people to sing the DuckTales theme.
10200210	10201831	My brother and Jove were there.
10202071	10203492	I tried to get Jove to sing.
10203956	10204356	Yeah, right.
10205156	10216400	I went up there with my bro, and the camera was on us, and after we sang the song, dude in the booth was like, yeah, give the dude with the VOG shirt a poster, because he actually sang the words.
10216960	10217501	Nice.
10218661	10221522	Way to, good job name checking the station, too.
10221582	10222442	It's always a good thing.
10223563	10224883	We love... Well, we got...
10226991	10231773	Well, we gotta thank Uk-chan for that because of how big the VOG logo is on our shirts.
10232193	10233194	Mm-hmm.
10233274	10234955	Good job.
10235235	10245020	Well, I know you guys are on your way home and you gotta get there safe and everything, but since you guys are gonna be talking about this undoubtedly on Anime Jam Session this Tuesday, what do we have to look forward to?
10246660	10247801	A complete review.
10247821	10249362	A whole lot of stuff.
10249522	10251163	But before we go, a couple of things.
10251543	10255465	Another game that's worth picking up is LEGO City Undercover.
10255785	10256185	Really?
10256205	10256285	Yeah.
10257745	10260145	Yes, are you a fan of the Shawshank Redemption?
10260886	10261226	Yes.
10264166	10268807	The game has a lot of pop culture references, including a scene from the Shawshank Redemption.
10268967	10271307	That's kind of random in a Lego game.
10271327	10272808	It's a prison break.
10272908	10279389	Basically, you have to go undercover into a prison and talk to one of the characters.
10279909	10281249	The character's name is Blue.
10282469	10283489	Okay, okay.
10284630	10286850	And he starts talking like Morgan Freeman.
10288806	10293248	And some of the stuff he says, I was kind of hearing it.
10293288	10295149	I'm like, why do I know this?
10296069	10298490	And then he said something and I'm like, blue.
10298570	10301172	I'm like, oh crap, it's Shawshank!
10302409	10302469	Oh!
10302489	10302589	Oh!
10332256	10333197	That was bad.
10333477	10337159	Just as bad as the Nvidia Shield controller.
10338559	10340140	Oh, was that on the show floor?
10341461	10342301	Yes, I played it.
10342321	10345363	The controls were... The controlling was weak.
10346764	10349745	The outline for doing the directional cross was really bad.
10350145	10353246	And the demo game was Sonic 4.
10354127	10358948	And when the song would end, it would pause for a half second and replay the track again.
10358988	10360068	I'm like, yeah, no.
10360389	10360849	Oh, Lord.
10361669	10364330	You know, Bobby was not a big fan of the Ouya controller.
10365050	10367951	Did you get to see that in comparison to the NVIDIA one?
10369469	10372150	I did not know that Ouya was on display.
10372630	10373591	I did not know.
10373731	10375872	There's not enough time to see everything at one pass.
10375892	10376452	It doesn't matter.
10376472	10377533	I'll be getting in like a week.
10379474	10379854	All right.
10380795	10382776	Okay.
10383256	10385297	I got to let you go, guys, so we can go wrap up the show.
10385357	10386918	But any other last thoughts on PAX?
10389279	10393281	Get your butts out here for 2014 so we can do VOGCon 2014.
10393581	10395082	And unfortunately for ActDeft,
10395512	10397153	since he's a staffer, he does tech.
10397453	10403114	He'll be staffing the con for all three days, so by the time he gets off a shift, all the fun stuff's already happened.
10404855	10405615	Womp womp.
10407416	10414718	You know, though, VOGCon 2013 is DragonCon, and you got to Atlanta for one con this year, so I expect you're going to be able to make it twice.
10415998	10417239	Well, look at it this way.
10417819	10421120	If I graduate from college, I get those marks, and I land the job,
10421673	10428837	We'll be partying our fabulous little asses off Awesome, we can play game Yes!
10430398	10431719	I challenge you to game
10433646	10436208	That's not a challenge, that's a fun thing to do!
10436608	10439450	And you had to do it in deep Russian voices.
10440111	10440931	You know what, though?
10441311	10448076	It has to be better than what we did at Faname, which was just the one bottle of Malibu and us going all over the place looking for a soda.
10448877	10450218	How about this for the tagline?
10450438	10453040	In Soviet Russia, gameplay you!
10454298	10459001	That was it, and Ukchan, if we're going to do that, Jovidea will be there with our kinky vodka.
10459442	10461503	Oh my god, the kinky vodka was so good.
10461543	10464285	Alright, I'm getting drunk off this conversation.
10464385	10465286	Ranma, I gotta let you go.
10465626	10466367	Take care, you guys.
10466387	10470189	Big hello to all you guys at Anime Jam Session, Jovidea, and whoever else might be with you.
10470930	10471710	Take care, guys, okay?
10473232	10474012	You got it, thank you.
10474032	10474232	Bye!
10476477	10476777	Love it.
10477217	10477817	All right, guys.
10477897	10480058	Sadly, it is time I shut down the Skype line.
10480098	10482119	We have been taking Skype calls for about 40 minutes, you know.
10482379	10483319	But most of it was Bobby.
10483999	10485660	Well, yes, but, you know, with good reason.
10485740	10489181	But we had a lot from Zaku and Magi and, you know, Ranma as well.
10489201	10491202	So I appreciate everybody who called.
10491522	10494683	If you didn't get through tonight, but you have something to say, for the love of God, email us.
10494823	10496924	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10497264	10499184	Give Dark Sakura some work to do next week.
10501955	10505076	In the meantime, some quick Twitter topics before I go for last-minute stories.
10505676	10510977	TigerClaw305 wants to remind us that XCOM Enemy Unknown was announced for iOS.
10511337	10513497	I forgot about this, but I did hear about this.
10514117	10517258	They're talking about they're going to be charging probably a little more money for it.
10517498	10519459	It's not going to be a 99-cent game.
10519559	10522179	Think more along the lines of a $15 game.
10522499	10526380	But that would be in line with Squeenix pricing on iOS, so it would make a lot of sense.
10526920	10531544	But yeah, they say it's going to be just like you're playing it on PC or any of those.
10531664	10535107	I mean, XCOM makes sense to be on iPad.
10535127	10535647	It would work.
10536448	10538650	iPhone would be a little too tiny.
10538670	10539471	I don't know about that one.
10539591	10541232	Even iPad Mini might be a little much.
10541272	10541532	I don't know.
10543595	10546038	DarkSakura wanted to follow up on the rapid fire news.
10546238	10552025	If you bought La Mulana on Playism or Desura, you will get a Steam key after April 15th.
10552085	10554988	So some of you already are going to own this new La Mulana.
10555909	10562537	Also for next week, since we're so close to 500 and with all the old school talk, can we air Best Hits Part 1 next week?
10564487	10564787	Maybe.
10565187	10565507	We'll see.
10565648	10566788	I don't want to promise anything yet.
10566829	10568029	You never know what we might come up with.
10569210	10575456	And Actdeft also posted a story about Dust and Elysian Tale that was covered in our Rapid Fire news earlier.
10575516	10577197	Must have been in the restroom when we went over that.
10577637	10581801	But I will say this story does say that a sequel may be in the works.
10582161	10584083	Which, you know, game does well, sequel comes out.
10584143	10585304	That's no big surprise there.
10586304	10590248	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us there and tweet us for a future week.
10591472	10592653	Last Minute Stories tonight, Loki.
10593734	10594634	This is kind of cool.
10594714	10601239	They have put together this project called the Unleashed Project.
10601259	10605382	And what it is, it's a total conversion for Sonic Generations.
10606202	10607663	That's Sonic Unleashed.
10607863	10612326	Sonic Unleashed has been ported to PC completely.
10613007	10614688	And it runs better than it did on console.
10615108	10615368	Nice.
10616409	10619151	Because they're using the Generations engine.
10620872	10620992	Okay.
10621624	10628570	And Unleashed, I'm talking about all the actual non-werewolf, werehog levels.
10629111	10631953	We're talking about all the good levels.
10631993	10632654	All the good ones.
10633194	10633455	Nice.
10635456	10636017	Alright, that's it.
10636992	10637994	All right, that's it.
10638354	10641478	Well, that's going to wrap us up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10641538	10652812	This episode's going to have to suit you for two weeks, but we've got an archive of about 497 episodes before this one, so if you need something to hold you over next week, go back and grab it.
10652992	10654894	All the podcasts are still...
10655715	10657936	on our server back through about 320.
10659456	10661297	So there's plenty that are on the feed to grab.
10661577	10665538	If you need something before that, hit up Dark Tetsuya, who's in our chat room.
10665578	10673740	He's got the link to the OL Archive, where they dug up fucking episodes of Vanilla Sky and guys on a show.
10674080	10676301	They probably have your music show you used to do.
10676321	10677201	Somebody probably recorded that.
10677841	10683763	Good lord, which was all like, if I had to go out and run errands, I'd just put on Eddie Izzard and I'd come back.
10683783	10691386	People used to bootleg the shit out of Orange Lounge Radio, the station, so it's pretty, now all this time later, it's awesome that they did that, really.
10691546	10695227	I am also planning this Wednesday to be in Turntable.
10696376	10697436	Oh, I missed turntable.
10698217	10698777	Good times.
10699097	10703080	Doing basically what I used to do on my pump of the volume.
10703140	10703660	That's awesome.
10703701	10704401	I missed turntable.
10704881	10705542	I always forget there.
10705562	10706422	Pop in there with me, Robert.
10706542	10707343	I very well might.
10707423	10708284	Just let me know what night.
10708364	10710545	As long as it isn't when, what's the night?
10710565	10711125	I said Wednesday.
10711286	10712346	Oh, Wednesday's Horde House.
10712466	10713287	I'm dead after Horde House.
10713487	10714568	Okay, after Horde House is fine.
10715088	10719111	This week is actually, I need to give this a shout out, Horde House episode 100 is this Wednesday.
10719131	10719251	Nice.
10719331	10720151	Yeah, big milestone.
10720252	10720812	Mazel tov.
10720992	10722393	Giveaways on this week's show.
10723093	10723874	So, unfortunately.
10723894	10725015	Give me some interest in WoW.
10726695	10727816	You've got the secret world.
10728256	10733098	I got it because it was on sale for $22 instead of the full $30.
10733758	10734939	I don't blame you.
10735599	10736479	Check it out.
10736639	10737900	And I got yelled at for spending money.
10738440	10740921	Well, that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10741121	10745743	We just want to thank you guys for tuning in, supporting Independent Radio.
10745863	10751145	We just do this because somebody brought this up before, just kind of the whole talk about the family issue.
10752645	10764693	You guys that are so enthusiastic about this show, there may not be 10,000 of you, but even the fact that there's five of you makes this so worth doing week in and week out.
10764953	10770636	And as we are coming up on episode 500, has really made it worth it and why we've been stuck with it for so long.
10771677	10772918	We don't charge for this show.
10773338	10779822	We're not going to be asking you for $12,000 to do this here in person every other week.
10780022	10781703	I am working on a gift for our listeners, though.
10782944	10783284	What's that?
10783364	10784084	We talked about it earlier.
10784104	10785084	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
10785465	10786165	Tease that in a future way.
10786365	10793408	But I just wanted to say... Unfortunately, though, we have to raise the limit of friends you have to... Or the minimum of friends you have to ask.
10793448	10795389	You have to tell 500 of your friends.
10795609	10796029	That's right.
10796069	10796329	That's right.
10796349	10797710	You're going to have to tell way more of your friends.
10798530	10799891	We have conventions we want to go to.
10800011	10802111	We don't charge you guys to listen to this show.
10803071	10808573	I can tell you it does not take $10,000 to put on this show.
10809113	10814695	It takes passion and dedication and wanting to do it for the loyal listeners.
10814935	10815635	And that is...
10816275	10817216	What we get out of it.
10817476	10820039	And so all we ask is help us grow our family.
10820440	10821781	Spread the word about the show.
10822342	10823483	Tell a friend or two about it.
10823563	10825785	Give us a thumbs up on Stitcher.
10825965	10829809	And if you're on Tumblr, reblog when I freaking post it and not just hit like.
10830470	10833573	Jamie is just here for her tumbles and wanting more followers.
10833994	10837417	I've figured since I've been using my Tumblr to promote the show.
10839352	10841534	I'm also using my Mass Effect Tumblr to promote the show.
10843056	10844197	So don't give me that, Rob.
10844618	10844938	All right.
10845519	10846019	That does it.
10846119	10846600	Thank you, guys.
10846960	10851665	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought for these two weeks, and then we'll be back on April 7th.
10852065	10853387	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
10853700	10854400	I have a headache.
10854761	10855801	Stupid sinus infection.
10856161	10856422	Sorry.
10857422	10860424	My final thought is hazelnut frappuccinos.
10860644	10861184	Pretty good.
10861545	10862345	I'm going to go get one.
10862545	10863246	Pretty good.
10863606	10864686	Is that Starbucks on the way?
10865047	10865607	Any of them.
10865647	10867308	It's open.
10867428	10867848	Use the app.
10867868	10869489	The app will tell you when they're closed.
10870690	10871250	I don't have the app.
10871270	10872191	Girl, get with the time.
10873511	10874452	Last but not least, Loki.
10874512	10875012	It's a grind.
10875052	10875352	Hello.
10875452	10876432	Loki, your final thought.
10876492	10893297	Even though I'm not a huge fan of these games, it's really unfair that there's a Beatmania 3 final and a Keyboard Mania 3 final in Sacramento.
10894118	10896858	They want $100 for both.
10896998	10898199	Rob, do you just want to split the price?
10898319	10900039	I'll take the Beatmania and you take the Keyboard Mania?
10900079	10901760	Where am I going to put a Keyboard Mania in this house?
10902060	10902700	In my backyard.
10903841	10907662	If you can hold on to the other machine for me until we get a house, then yes, I'll do it.
10907822	10908483	I'll talk to Dan.
10910123	10914025	Someone's already bid on it, on one of them, so you gotta outbid them.
10914865	10916086	Come on, it's at $99.
10916206	10917626	We'll do what we can.
10918587	10919007	That's it.
10919247	10920267	Have a great week, everybody.
10920307	10920827	Be safe.
10921228	10922328	Don't be a dick online.
10922368	10924169	I know you guys won't be.
10924689	10929871	I hope all you guys had a blast at PAX and have fun at Game Developers Conference if you're one of those guys going to that.
10930813	10931815	Pixar didn't happen.
10932155	10937908	And we'll see you back here in a couple weeks on Orange Lawn Tradio episode 499 when we come back on April 7th.
10938349	10939351	Have a great week, everybody.
10939712	10940053	Good night.
10940808	10943830	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
