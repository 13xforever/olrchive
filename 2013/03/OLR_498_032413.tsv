0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	Tonight, March 24th, 2013, new games are shown at PAX East
18000	21000	Wii U shop age restrictions are lifted in Europe
21000	25000	and could an exploit in Origin allow malicious code on your PC?
26000	29000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Yeah, it's called Origin. Hi!
33000	35000	Hey, that was my line.
35000	39000	Hello, everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
39000	48000	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live for this March 24th, 2013, the 498th episode of our show.
48000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining over the next few hours to talk about video games with my co-host.
53000	56000	Please say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56000	58000	I'm eating something evil thanks to Loki.
58000	61000	And I totally stole her joke and it was funny.
61000	62000	You bitch.
62000	66000	I know. Here, here's a quarter for that joke. Here's a cup of coffee for that joke.
66000	68000	I love this coffee. It's very delicious.
68000	71000	Alright, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
71000	73000	I ate so many breadsticks that my head hurts now.
73000	77000	Who's bringing the food? Supply and Oil, our studios with breadsticks.
77000	81000	I ate most of it. It's just I couldn't finish the last two. I mean, ten was enough.
81000	86000	You guys didn't know this, but every week at OLR is a potluck, you know, where everybody brings a dish.
86000	89000	I bring the coffee, which is funny because Loki doesn't drink coffee.
89000	93000	Loki brings the pizza and breadsticks and DarkSakura brings...
93000	94000	Healthy stuff.
94000	95000	Gross.
95000	96000	Salad and Chinese food.
96000	98000	Who wants that? Chinese food isn't that healthy.
98000	99000	I bring you coffee sometimes.
99000	103000	It depends what you get at Chinese food, right? Depends what you get.
103000	108000	I went to Panda and I had the Mandarin chicken with no sauce over vegetables and fried rice.
108000	110000	Delicious.
110000	115000	Alright, we're not a food show, believe it or not, but we are a show about video games.
115000	119000	I'm sure PAX East, on a lot of your minds, we're going to be talking about some of the news that came out of PAX East.
119000	122000	Sadly, I didn't get a chance to go this year.
122000	126000	I went to PAX East the very first year, which was, I think, 2010, right?
126000	128000	I went to PAX East that year. I had a great time.
128000	132000	Sadly, it's a little tricky to get out to Boston from here, you know.
132000	134000	That's a bit of a plane trip.
134000	137000	And just with my day job and everything, there was no way I was going to get out there this year.
137000	144000	But I'll tell you what, y'all made me jealous through your Twitter updates and your forum posts and all that stuff I was watching.
144000	146000	Y'all made me jealous I wasn't at PAX East.
146000	148000	But keep the pictures coming.
148000	154000	I saw a lot of VOG people, it looked like, were in somebody's hotel room drinking responsibly, I hope.
154000	158000	Playing Cards Against Humanity at 3 a.m., pictures were going up.
158000	160000	So, good times.
160000	163000	Very happy to see that all you guys are having a good time.
163000	166000	I know we had some of our shows at the Voice of Geeks Network.
166000	175000	Remember, Orange Launch Radio does tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or VOGNetwork.com.
175000	179000	Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
179000	184000	Not tonight, though, because Bobby is one of those folks that was at PAX East and he's on a plane home right now.
184000	187000	Yeah, Bobby. So this is now the Mass Effect show.
187000	192000	I think the entire group from Anime Jam Session was there.
192000	196000	I think Rama, Giovanni, Ari Rockefeller, they were all there.
196000	199000	And Critical Myth, I know, was there.
199000	203000	Let's see, we're trying to think who else from VOG shows.
203000	207000	I think that was it from the show shows, because obviously the gals from Britain didn't come out for it.
207000	210000	And British Invaders, ones in Canada, ones in Britain.
210000	213000	I don't think they went out for it either.
213000	217000	But certainly a lot of shows. So they'll be giving you some updates throughout the week.
217000	220000	I'm hoping some of our regulars, because a lot of our regulars were there.
220000	222000	Misty was there, Matt was there, Rama was there.
222000	227000	I'm hoping to get some calls from people a little later on tonight to talk about PAX East and all that good stuff.
227000	232000	For now, though, we weren't there. We're going to get into the big news that came out of PAX East in a little bit.
232000	235000	I have to ask, because this is what I ask every time there's a PAX...
235000	238000	What was the Megafon event this year?
238000	243000	Oh, I was watching SEG's Twitter and he posted it and I forgot already.
243000	247000	It didn't sound like a new game or anything to me.
247000	250000	Maybe somebody in chat can help us out there.
250000	253000	Live.vognetwork.com is our chat room.
253000	258000	And act deft in our chat room live tonight, confirming yes, Critical Myth, AJS, and Bobby Blackwall for all there.
258000	262000	So, awesome. I'm looking forward to hearing their commentary on the show throughout the week.
262000	264000	But the real party is here.
264000	268000	That's right. And as we get closer to our 500th episode here at Orange Lounge Radio.
268000	273000	One thing I wanted to talk about tonight, we were talking about just before we went live tonight.
273000	277000	We were kind of looking back because, what was it? Somebody joined chat.
277000	279000	What's this guy's name? Catastrophic Moggy joined chat.
279000	280000	Yes.
280000	284000	And I was getting that name confused in my head with a guy that used to be here locally that was Moogle Hunter.
284000	285000	I think it was his name or something like that.
285000	286000	Yes.
286000	290000	So we were talking about all these people from, I'm talking like the old school O.L.R. days.
290000	295000	Like back when we had the edit contest of the DDR machine and some of the people we had on the show.
295000	300000	Like I was talking about, remember Rick and Paul and Dave, I was thinking about them.
300000	303000	And we were thinking about it. We're like, God, I wonder where they are now.
303000	306000	And I think Jamie had started to say, well, they were in high school or something like that.
306000	308000	I was going to a high paid school.
308000	313000	Oh, and I was like, oh, my God, like Dave was like 17 back when the show started.
313000	317000	He's like 27. He probably has kids now.
317000	321000	So here's my little request for what it's worth.
321000	323000	And another old school person is in the mailbag tonight.
323000	325000	And I know we're going to get to that later.
325000	332000	I would really love to hear from some of these really old school people that used to be on the show a long time ago.
332000	339000	My house is open to you all that can make it on April 14th, which is the big show.
339000	341000	Bring me birthday presents.
341000	344000	No, just so y'all know, no show next week.
344000	345000	I'm registered.
345000	349000	Easter, Episode 499 is April 7th.
349000	353000	Is that right? Yeah, April 7th. And then Episode 500 is April 14th.
353000	357000	So I would really love for the old school people to show up.
357000	362000	I would love to see Anita, who I know is the DDR angel, if she can make it.
362000	365000	You know, just some of the old school people would crack me up.
365000	367000	I chatted with her on Steam the other day. Yeah, it was nice.
367000	370000	Yeah, yeah, I see her. I see her hubby on Google Plus all the time.
370000	375000	We sometimes exchange our recipes and things, too. Sometimes.
375000	377000	Yeah, I know she runs a blog now and all that.
377000	379000	Her blog is awesome. It's called The Eco Maker.
379000	382000	Anyone who wants good home stuff, check it out.
382000	387000	It was Space Team. Space Team. Is that an old school game?
387000	393000	No, it's a new Android mobile game. It's a cooperative team game or something.
393000	394000	I don't know.
394000	399000	I heard a girl won, which is interesting because it was not Pork Buns.
399000	401000	It was on the show last week, two weeks ago.
401000	405000	The gal we had on the show last week, sadly, she got eliminated the first round in Bomberman.
405000	408000	It's the curse of coming on OLR.
409000	412000	Come on this show after you're done with your competition.
412000	415000	Remember when we had that girl from The Tester on the show and then she was off the show?
415000	416000	She was after it, though.
416000	418000	That's true. It was all pre-taped.
418000	419000	Yeah.
419000	423000	I still like to think there's a bit of a curse here at Orange Lounge Radio.
423000	428000	So, yes. Episode 500, I want you old school Sacramento's DDR community.
428000	430000	I want you guys here in the house.
430000	433000	I remember trying to register that as an address.
433000	434000	Oh, really?
434000	436000	Why I had to get Sacbimani instead.
436000	437000	You know who I know?
437000	440000	Because some Catholic organization registered it.
440000	442000	You know who I know would come?
442000	443000	Who?
443000	445000	And who I am friends with on Facebook and I literally haven't seen.
445000	447000	We just keep in touch on Facebook. Miss Janae.
447000	450000	And she married Dark Child. Did you know that?
450000	451000	Yes. And she has a little one.
451000	452000	Yes. They had a baby.
452000	453000	Yes.
453000	455000	This show is so fucking old.
455000	457000	I don't have a baby. I have a cat.
457000	459000	She's a lot better than a baby.
459000	461000	I have a cat, too. I love kitties.
461000	464000	She doesn't drool on me. However, she does chew on cords.
464000	467000	Loki has a baby. Well, not even a baby anymore. He's like a toddler.
467000	469000	You guys weren't bowling the other day, right?
469000	470000	You have a small person.
470000	471000	He's like almost three.
471000	474000	Oh, my God. The video was adorable, though. The bowling.
474000	475000	Did you guys have fun?
475000	476000	That's a short video.
476000	478000	Yeah. The long video. Yeah.
478000	480000	He didn't let us bowl.
480000	482000	Because we have the little ramp thing.
482000	484000	Because he can't carry the ball.
484000	486000	I mean, the latest ball is like six pounds.
486000	493000	He might be able to carry that, but I'm not going to have him carry a big ball that's got the oil from the lane on it and stuff.
493000	495000	You know, with his feet. No, that's not a good idea.
495000	499000	So he had fun just pushing it down the little ramp so that it would knock stuff over.
499000	501000	But he wouldn't let us have a turn.
501000	513000	I managed to bowl twice and my wife once and he bowled like, you know, two whole games worth of, you know, turns for three people.
513000	517000	Catastrophic Moggy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
517000	520000	What is this? A show about gaming or a trip down memory lane?
520000	523000	Now, I'm sure that comment is tongue in cheek and you don't really mean anything negative by it.
523000	529000	But you know what? When you've been gaming with the same crowd for so long.
529000	534000	And, you know, you guys have to remember when we did the DDR stuff, we were really heavy into Dance Dance Revolution.
534000	536000	We would meet at the arcade every Wednesday.
536000	539000	It was it was like clockwork every Wednesday or whatever day it was at the time.
539000	542000	We'd go, we'd play some DDR for a few hours.
542000	544000	Then we'd go and have dinner, sit down.
544000	546000	You kind of build up a little bit of a family.
546000	550000	So, yeah, you know why? It is a little more than just video games.
550000	554000	It's about family, just like a lot of my second cat.
554000	556000	A lot of the same people turn up here and chat every week.
556000	557000	I'm on my second cat.
557000	559000	I know. We've been through a lot.
559000	561000	But we'll reminisce more in a couple of weeks.
561000	564000	Memory all alone.
564000	567000	You just want an excuse to sing songs from cats.
567000	570000	All right. Let's see. That's it.
570000	574000	I think for the pre-week gaming banter, we'll get into the actual news from PAX East in a minute.
574000	578000	But we're going to start off the show tonight, as we do always, talking about our gaming weeks
578000	581000	and the video games that we've been playing this week.
581000	582000	DarkSakura.
582000	588000	Of course, I played Mass Effect because I got the high-res mod working on Mass Effect 3.
588000	590000	You have all of it.
590000	591000	No.
591000	592000	OK.
592000	593000	It's OK.
593000	597000	I played, yeah, I played Mass Effect 3, got the high-res mod working,
597000	599000	and then it started crashing whenever I would do the Tango.
599000	602000	And I figured out that the problem was my coalesced.
602000	605000	And I was what was doing it to me.
605000	609000	Because I had everything set by the old version of the high-res mod.
609000	616000	And the new version doesn't require you to change any of your texture settings in the coalesced file.
616000	620000	So I went and used my old coalesced file. Everything worked fine.
620000	625000	The only problem that I have with it is that it makes all of James' textures black.
625000	628000	Just like the textures won't load on him.
628000	630000	So I still don't know how to fix that.
630000	633000	Otherwise everything works and it looks beautiful.
633000	636000	Tango down. Tango down.
636000	641000	But the cool thing about this mod is that one of the textures that comes with it
641000	645000	is one where you can sort of see Tali's face through her mask.
645000	651000	And she's got the extra little bits they photoshopped on that one picture in Mass Effect 3
651000	652000	if you happen to be romancing her.
652000	654000	So I thought it was a neat touch.
654000	656000	She's got the little bits on her eyebrows.
656000	658000	So anyway, I also played some Mass Effect 2.
658000	661000	Which I have now figured out how to use Ashley's skin and hair.
661000	665000	Except with a completely different face structure so it doesn't quite look like Ashley.
665000	667000	And I'm using Morin's outfit.
667000	670000	So I've been playing around a little bit.
670000	673000	I've gotten the game to crash once. I was proud of myself.
673000	678000	And then... I'm not doing the fandango act daft.
678000	682000	I also started The Secret World.
682000	685000	And the problem is that I've had a sinus infection all week.
685000	689000	As I've said on a previous episode, this time of year, sinus infections.
689000	693000	Like you wouldn't believe. Allergies all over the place.
693000	701000	And so I got through the very beginning of the Templar scenario.
701000	705000	And then I was like, oh my god, gunfire. My head hurts.
705000	707000	I can't look at this anymore. Bleh.
707000	709000	So...
709000	712000	The Secret World's at MMO. I remember playing this too in beta.
712000	716000	Is it totally free now? Or is it paid a Guild Wars model?
716000	720000	You can pay a subscription and get all the premium shit.
720000	722000	Or you can buy a few things here and there.
722000	724000	I just have the completely freebie model.
724000	730000	And it's okay. I haven't gotten too much into it. The control's alright.
730000	735000	But I did sign up for the next Final Fantasy XIV beta.
735000	738000	So hopefully that'll work out for me.
739000	746000	I haven't cancelled WoW yet. Every time I think I am, I was like, oh but I'll miss everybody.
746000	749000	Just a tip on that Final Fantasy XIV beta though.
749000	752000	If you do get in, it's under NDA. And you're not even supposed to say if you're in the beta.
752000	754000	I know.
754000	759000	Trust me, it would be a real shame if you got into the beta for Final Fantasy XIV.
759000	761000	You couldn't talk about it on this show.
761000	765000	Even though you very much wanted to talk about everything that you were seeing in the beta.
765000	772000	But you couldn't do that if you're under NDA. Trust me, I've heard from very close, very respected, very handsome sources.
772000	775000	All I said is that I applied for it.
775000	781000	I applied and said, yeah, I own every single one of these consoles that's on this list. What's your point?
781000	785000	Except for the 3DS and the Vita. I own the good consoles on that list.
785000	788000	Hey, the Vita and the 3DS are cool.
789000	795000	And god, I was going to play Mirror's Edge and Dan's like, you're going to throw up, you're going to get sick, don't play it, you're going to get sick, you're going to get sick.
795000	797000	I'm like, fine, I'm going to play it.
797000	800000	Yes, the show is on whoever you are, VOG155.
802000	804000	Tell us about your week. Don't re-chat.
804000	806000	Well, shit.
806000	809000	Yeah, I played Mass Effect 3. Shut up, Raginator.
810000	815000	So, uh, yeah.
816000	822000	Alright, see, they derail you when you go to look at chat when they're in mid-science, it derails you.
822000	827000	It's just, most of the time, I didn't really have much of an energy to play much of anything.
827000	832000	Just because I was on so many damn sinus medicines.
832000	839000	Like, I was on Daquil, Sudafed, Benadryl, and Allegra in various doses, and then Nyquil.
839000	841000	Well, get better, dammit.
841000	846000	I feel much better today. It's just, my nose feels like it's, you know, the Sahara.
846000	850000	ActDeft is asking about Mirror's Edge. Was that something you were supposed to start this week?
850000	852000	Yeah, that's what I was going to start this week was Mirror's Edge.
852000	855000	And that's the one that Dan says, you're going to get sick.
855000	857000	I'm like, fine, I'm going to get sick, meh.
857000	859000	It's pretty, though.
859000	865000	Yeah, I'm going to play it. I just want to wait until, because the other problem is that all this week I've had bad equilibrium issues.
865000	871000	And I don't know if I've made it evident to our lovely listeners yet, I've started drawing again.
871000	878000	And we actually rearranged the vault slash computer room to where I have my year old desk, pretty much, the table.
878000	885000	And there is my drawing surface. So I've actually been dedicating quite a bit of time to rebuilding lost skills.
885000	894000	And it's been, but I've been trying to, when I play a game, if I'm, you know, pausing at a point in it,
894000	901000	I'm actually starting to sketch out what's on my screen, just to sort of help me with proportion and space and distance and that type of thing.
901000	911000	It's been a pretty interesting exercise. But I figured my first love has been, you know, video games and art. So why not?
911000	913000	And your second love is Garrus.
914000	916000	My second love is Dan. Garrus is third.
916000	918000	Alright. Loki, how was your-
918000	920000	Oh, followed by the Guardian Legend.
920000	922000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
922000	931000	Let's see, I played Garry's Mod this week. I actually bought that on their little Steam sale that they have for some indie stuff. It was only three bucks.
931000	936000	And I was trying to get to work with the game, you know, the Xbox 360 controller.
936000	943000	And it's a little awkward because they don't have the keys mapped out quite correctly. So I couldn't really do a whole ton.
943000	950000	And also I kept losing my gravity gun, which was kind of annoying because I can't arrange stuff without that.
950000	956000	And so basically all I was able to do was throw a large iron beam in the air and crush myself with it.
956000	958000	And so that was kind of boring.
959000	966000	Instead I went and tried to- well, that kind of prompted me to look into some other games that supported controllers.
966000	972000	And I had Cave Story Plus, which I knew that supported controllers, but for some reason I couldn't find-
972000	976000	I didn't look, I guess, for the options for the controller support.
976000	980000	And then I found it, and so I started playing that. And so I'm enjoying that quite a bit.
981000	989000	I also played more Saints Row the Third, both on PC and Xbox 360.
989000	999000	And going through grinding through the activities, man. I hope the next game doesn't do that.
999000	1004000	Oh, let me introduce you to these activities that you've played before. They didn't do that in the second game.
1004000	1007000	They didn't even do that in the first game. They just had the activities there.
1007000	1013000	The third game, half the missions are just like, hey, you have to do this activity for this reason,
1013000	1016000	even though it doesn't really quite apply to the game.
1016000	1025000	Before Saints Row 2 and 1, it was like drug trafficking. Now it's merchandise trafficking.
1025000	1032000	It's like, really? Come on, these guys are like big time gangsters now, and we're trafficking merchandise?
1032000	1036000	Like bobbleheads and shit? That's kind of stupid.
1036000	1041000	Or, you know, oh, hey, you're kind of even going along with that.
1041000	1045000	There's like an escort mission where you have to escort them with a chopper.
1045000	1047000	It's like Guardian Angel is what it's called.
1047000	1053000	And half the time you're firing rockets out of the side of a helicopter,
1053000	1060000	and then the other time you're, for some reason, repelled down the side of a building and sniping.
1060000	1063000	Like, you could snipe on top of the building.
1063000	1067000	You have to repel down the building a little bit for some damn reason to snipe.
1067000	1072000	Because, you know, snipers never take position on roofs. They always repel halfway down the roof, you know.
1072000	1074000	It just makes no sense.
1074000	1077000	And it's one of the things I didn't really like originally in the game.
1077000	1083000	That and the Saints book activities are kind of annoying too, but I haven't gotten to that again yet.
1083000	1089000	Which is why I'm so pissed off that I lost my save in the first place, because I had all that shit done.
1089000	1096000	I was one activity, or one car theft away from completing all of the activities and all the Saints book stuff.
1096000	1098000	And then, of course, you know, lost my save.
1098000	1100000	So, that was fun.
1100000	1105000	Unfortunately, I also had Bioshock Infinite to play.
1105000	1108000	Haven't gotten the chance to do that, because I was cooking this morning.
1108000	1111000	And also the Defiance Beta on 360.
1111000	1114000	But, by the time I get to play it, the beta is going to be over and Defiance will be out next week.
1114000	1116000	Or, the week after next.
1116000	1119000	All those Bioshock Infinite reviews ought to start hitting tomorrow, right?
1119000	1121000	Because the game's out Tuesday?
1121000	1122000	Yeah.
1122000	1123000	Am I right? Yeah.
1123000	1125000	Well, I mean, there was the one from IGN, because, you know.
1125000	1126000	They bought it.
1126000	1128000	Yeah, they bought it.
1128000	1130000	But I'm sure the game's great.
1130000	1131000	It's going to be fantastic.
1131000	1132000	I'm sure the game's great, yeah.
1132000	1135000	Unlike the Walking Dead game, holy shit.
1135000	1137000	That's been a source of comedy this week, hasn't it?
1137000	1140000	It's like, yeah.
1140000	1143000	EA's been, I bet they're glad that, you know, the Walking Dead game.
1143000	1145000	It's like, seriously, one company after the next.
1145000	1147000	I wonder who's going to have this shitty game next.
1147000	1149000	Is Injustice going to be any good?
1149000	1150000	I hope so.
1150000	1152000	Or, like, you know, maybe Defiance.
1152000	1154000	Because it is based off a sci-fi series.
1154000	1157000	So, that's not absolutely positive.
1157000	1160000	Yeah, my money's on Injustice, actually.
1160000	1162000	But, we'll see, we'll see.
1162000	1163000	I can't shade a game.
1163000	1164000	Dead Island Riptide, maybe.
1164000	1167000	I can't shade a game I haven't played Saints Row IV.
1167000	1168000	That's a ways away.
1168000	1171000	Some of the feedback coming out of PAX East is pretty good.
1171000	1172000	Again, I can't shade a game I haven't played.
1172000	1174000	That's the thing, that's what's confusing me.
1174000	1177000	Because, like, I've been, you know, I'm going to buy Saints Row IV.
1177000	1178000	Just because...
1178000	1180000	You're a whore for Saints Row, and that's fine.
1180000	1184000	I like Saints Row, but at the same time, what they've shown me
1184000	1188000	isn't necessarily giving me the most confidence that this game's going to be good.
1188000	1194000	Like, first off, Saints Row III, I really wish it was more toned back towards 2.
1194000	1195000	2 was the best.
1195000	1200000	It was, like, the best, you know, balance between, like, a gritty game
1200000	1203000	and, like, you know, ridiculous, you know.
1203000	1205000	But then 3 just, like, we're just going to go crazy.
1205000	1208000	And then 4, like, we're going even crazier.
1208000	1209000	Oh, and we're going to have a...
1209000	1210000	A dubstep gun.
1210000	1211000	Come on, that's hilarious.
1211000	1212000	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
1212000	1213000	That's funny.
1213000	1214000	We're going to have a...
1214000	1216000	We're going to have a...
1216000	1217000	Was it a...
1217000	1219000	A lot of DLC, basically.
1219000	1223000	I'm like, yeah, I remember the DLC from Saints Row III.
1223000	1224000	Your 20-minute mission.
1224000	1227000	I need someone who is at PAX East and played the game to call in and tell...
1227000	1228000	No one played the game.
1228000	1229000	No one played the game.
1229000	1230000	They watched a video.
1230000	1231000	Oh.
1231000	1232000	A short video.
1232000	1233000	It wasn't playable?
1233000	1234000	Nope.
1234000	1235000	10-minute video they watched.
1235000	1237000	It would have been playable, but anyway.
1237000	1238000	That's why it's not coming to the Wii.
1238000	1240000	It's not because they fucking hate the Wii.
1240000	1243000	It's because they have the engine done already and they're not going to port it.
1243000	1244000	All right.
1244000	1246000	Anything else for your gaming week?
1246000	1247000	That's it.
1247000	1248000	My gaming week.
1248000	1251000	I had a very Blizzard-tastic week because, obviously, I played a lot of WoW.
1251000	1256000	I've been working on a Hunter, who's, like, my PvP character and been having fun with
1256000	1257000	her.
1258000	1259000	Did I mention last week on the show?
1259000	1264000	I can't remember when this happened, but I sold an item on the Real Money Auction House
1264000	1265000	on Diablo III.
1265000	1266000	No, you didn't mention that.
1266000	1267000	Yes, I sold...
1267000	1268000	Guess how much I made?
1268000	1269000	A dollar.
1269000	1271000	I made 25 cents.
1271000	1272000	Yeah.
1272000	1273000	Woohoo.
1273000	1276000	Because the minimum you can list an item for is $1.25.
1276000	1278000	So that's what I put the item up for.
1278000	1281000	And then the transaction fee is always $1.
1281000	1282000	No matter what it sells for.
1282000	1284000	So $1.25 minus $1.
1284000	1287000	25 cents, baby.
1287000	1288000	Woohoo.
1288000	1289000	It worked for you.
1289000	1293000	I can put that towards a card pack in Hearthstone, but we'll get to that later.
1293000	1296000	So, yeah, I've been having fun with Diablo III, believe it or not.
1296000	1297000	Like, I'm just...
1297000	1298000	I'm kind of into it right now.
1298000	1299000	It's good.
1299000	1301000	Also, I played StarCraft.
1301000	1305000	No, I did not play that new expansion, but all my friends kind of going back to StarCraft
1305000	1308000	because of that expansion made me want to load up the game.
1308000	1312000	And I was like, whoa, the launcher, like, totally changed for this.
1312000	1316000	But I loaded up Star Jeweled, because Star Jeweled is, like, the reason for me to play
1316000	1317000	StarCraft.
1317000	1319000	And no, I don't have the new expansion.
1319000	1323000	And until I sell about, oh, I don't know, 100 more items on that real money auction
1323000	1324000	house.
1324000	1327000	I mean, if I can raise 40 bucks in Diablo III, I'll buy it.
1327000	1332000	But if I make a quarter every two weeks, I don't think that's going to happen pretty
1332000	1333000	soon.
1333000	1335000	So, there was that.
1335000	1338000	I've been playing some console stuff, too.
1338000	1345000	I have to admit, I played the Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate demo on Wii U.
1345000	1346000	The demo's awful, you guys.
1346000	1348000	It is awful.
1348000	1349000	And here's the thing.
1349000	1354000	Like, I have friends that are really into that game right now that are, like, having
1354000	1355000	a lot of fun with it.
1355000	1359000	And one way it was kind of described to me is that it's, like, Phantasy Star Online,
1359000	1362000	kind of, but a lot more grindy because it's a JRPG.
1362000	1364000	But I played this demo on Wii U.
1364000	1370000	And I just, like, the reason why I want to bring it up, not that I like to review games
1370000	1374000	based on the demo, but here's the reality.
1374000	1375000	That's what happens.
1375000	1379000	A lot of people do make their opinions based on the full game on the demo.
1379000	1383000	I mean, we've heard Bobby to death on his show talking about the Ni No Kuni and how
1383000	1384000	he hated that demo.
1384000	1386000	And, yeah, that was a pretty shitty demo, too.
1386000	1389000	And, again, here we have a case of a demo that's even worse.
1389000	1392000	Like, it just, it doesn't tell you anything about the game.
1392000	1393000	It doesn't set up anything.
1393000	1397000	What you're doing, there's this assumption that you'll just figure it out.
1397000	1399000	And it's just unacceptable.
1399000	1404000	Like, I can't figure out, like, why gaming companies don't know that or why they can't
1404000	1412000	invest 25 cents to create a splash screen that at least kind of details, like, we're
1412000	1416000	throwing you midway into the game and here's what's going on and here's the controls.
1416000	1418000	But I just thought it was fucking boring.
1418000	1420000	Like, it was seriously fucking boring.
1420000	1426000	I got this guy with a giant sword and I figured out that the monster I wanted was on my mini
1426000	1427000	map.
1427000	1433000	So I went to him and I button mashed to figure out what the attack buttons were for about
1433000	1434000	20 minutes.
1434000	1437000	And, finally, I caught it and it was like, doo doo, demo done.
1437000	1441000	And I was like, that was the most boring fucking thing I've done all week long.
1441000	1443000	Like, way to sell your game.
1443000	1445000	And so now I'm like, okay, but my friends like really-
1445000	1447000	Was laundry more fun?
1447000	1448000	It was.
1448000	1451000	Like, I know there are Monster Hunter fans that listen to this show that are like, Rob,
1451000	1452000	you're so ignorant.
1452000	1453000	The demo doesn't show this.
1453000	1454000	I'm sorry.
1454000	1456000	That doesn't work for me.
1456000	1460000	Like, if the company is going to sell me on the game, sell me on the game.
1460000	1465000	So now if I'm to be sold on this game, either I'm going to have to go play it at a friend's
1465000	1468000	house who's going to have to explain to me what's going on.
1468000	1474000	Maybe I'll put it in my Gamefly queue, but it's not like something I'm like-
1474000	1478000	The urgency of doing so just dropped a whole lot.
1478000	1480000	Let me just put it that way.
1480000	1482000	So, let's see.
1482000	1484000	Go into comments from chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1484000	1487000	ActDef says, Rob, you need to play Team Fortress 2 more.
1487000	1490000	You can sell stuff for over a hundred US dollars.
1490000	1494000	You know, I actually like, I was seriously going to boot up Team Fortress 2 the other
1494000	1496000	night and then I got distracted and did something else.
1496000	1499000	And it was because of like last week's show.
1499000	1503000	Orange Right in our chat room agrees with me about Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate.
1503000	1505000	That demo did not sell me on the game at all.
1505000	1506000	And it's a pity.
1506000	1508000	And you know what?
1508000	1510000	And I kind of have to remind myself.
1510000	1513000	Ni No Kuni had a pretty bad demo too.
1513000	1515000	But the full game's great.
1515000	1518000	And like, I don't know what convinced me to take the leap of faith there.
1518000	1521000	Or like I refused to do it in Monster Hunter.
1521000	1525000	But maybe because the Ni No Kuni demo, I kind of figured it out.
1525000	1528000	And it was fun in the long run once I finally figured it out.
1528000	1530000	I don't know.
1530000	1532000	One other game I played this week.
1532000	1534000	I just bought it today.
1534000	1536000	So I haven't had a lot of time to play it.
1536000	1538000	But I did buy Luigi's Mansion on 3DS.
1538000	1541000	And so I've only got to do some of the early levels.
1541000	1543000	Like where you go into that first little mansion.
1543000	1546000	I did not play the GameCube version.
1546000	1549000	Which I know a lot of people might be like, what?
1549000	1552000	But I didn't get my GameCube until well after the launch stuff.
1552000	1554000	In fact, I remember Loki bought me the GameCube.
1554000	1555000	It's a really awesome present.
1555000	1557000	When Animal Crossing came out.
1557000	1558000	Hell yeah.
1558000	1561000	At that point, Animal Crossing was all the rage at that point.
1561000	1564000	We didn't have time for Luigi's Mansion or any of the launch titles.
1564000	1566000	So I never played the original one.
1566000	1567000	But I've played the new one.
1567000	1568000	But only a little bit.
1568000	1570000	So I can't really give it a full review.
1570000	1573000	But I will say, some pretty good 3D effects.
1573000	1575000	And it really reminds me.
1575000	1577000	And this is a compliment.
1577000	1579000	It really reminds me of an old school PC game.
1579000	1583000	Like just in the way you're kind of walking around the mansion on the top screen.
1583000	1585000	And it's like you're finding items.
1585000	1588000	It for some reason kind of reminds me of an old school puzzler.
1588000	1591000	Like an old LucasArts game almost.
1591000	1593000	With a little more action though, obviously.
1593000	1595000	Because you're sucking in the ghosts and all that.
1595000	1598000	And you can find him hanged.
1598000	1600000	No multiplayer or anything like that yet.
1600000	1603000	Because I've literally only played the game like 30 minutes.
1603000	1605000	So I can't tell you anymore about it at this time.
1605000	1608000	But it was fun and the 3D effects were fun.
1608000	1610000	I like the whole little pixelator thing.
1610000	1612000	It looks like something out of Tron.
1612000	1613000	That cracked me up.
1613000	1616000	So, yeah. So Luigi's Mansion 3DS.
1616000	1618000	And that was my gaming week.
1618000	1622000	So, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1622000	1624000	Again, I think I mentioned this before.
1624000	1627000	But I just want to make sure you all know there is no Orange Lounge Radio next week.
1627000	1630000	Have a great Easter or Sunday off.
1630000	1631000	I'll be drunk on mimosas.
1631000	1632000	Will ya? Oh, from brunch?
1632000	1636000	No, where we're going for brunch, Murray Calendars, they give you like never-ending mimosas.
1636000	1638000	A lot of places do that for brunch.
1638000	1640000	I'm so happy.
1640000	1644000	That's like the friends that I have downtown that we like to go to brunch with all the time.
1644000	1648000	Like, we can't go to a place unless they have endless mimosas.
1648000	1653000	Because our one friend is like, no, I'm not going if I can't get mimosas.
1653000	1655000	So, good times.
1655000	1658000	Anyhow, so no show next week, but we will be back on April 7th.
1658000	1661000	I believe Bobby's here next week.
1661000	1664000	So, those of you guys that turn out here pretty loyally on Sunday night,
1664000	1666000	you'll have something to look forward to next week.
1666000	1671000	There may be a best of or something, but there won't be a pre-recorded show
1671000	1676000	because we're intentionally setting it up so that we know episode 500 is on this day.
1676000	1679000	So, that way we can kind of plan a little bit.
1679000	1681000	Alright, I think that's it.
1681000	1684000	Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio, yada yada.
1684000	1686000	Let's get into gaming news. Loki.
1686000	1691000	Well, this was completely unexpected, but Capcom announced, I guess,
1691000	1694000	a little bit ahead of their World of Capcom panel.
1694000	1699000	Or even, actually, I think it was teased before, but announced after World of Capcom panel
1699000	1706000	that they're going to be remastering DuckTales, like the old NES DuckTales game,
1706000	1708000	which is pretty fantastic.
1708000	1711000	You should have seen the flappy hands I made when I heard that news.
1711000	1713000	That was really unexpected.
1713000	1715000	Yes, very unexpected.
1715000	1718000	And basically, it's going to have hand-drawn sprites.
1718000	1721000	It's going to have all the original voices.
1721000	1727000	And it's coming to Wii U, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade, 15 bucks.
1727000	1731000	Probably, I want to say it was, I think it was this summer, maybe?
1731000	1733000	I don't know if they had a date yet on that.
1733000	1738000	But yes, all the original voice actors are supposed to be coming back,
1738000	1741000	including, I guess, the guy, the Scrooge, who's in his 90s.
1741000	1742000	Wow.
1742000	1743000	No, no.
1743000	1745000	He's in his 70s. Somebody else on the cast.
1745000	1748000	The Magic of Dispel voice actress is 90.
1748000	1749000	Oh, okay.
1749000	1752000	But she's been doing voices for Disney for years.
1752000	1753000	Right, exactly.
1753000	1755000	No, I think the guy-
1755000	1757000	Wasn't she also a Granny Gummy?
1757000	1758000	She might have been.
1758000	1763000	The guy who does Uncle Scrooge was also Mr. Ed way back in the day.
1763000	1764000	Wow.
1764000	1765000	Remember that show?
1765000	1766000	Yeah.
1766000	1769000	We weren't even alive when that show was on.
1769000	1770000	But we had Nick at Night.
1770000	1773000	Yeah, they used to rerun the shit out of it on Nickelodeon when we were younger,
1773000	1774000	so that's how I remember it.
1774000	1775000	I freaking loved Mr. Ed.
1775000	1778000	I'm just, it's really surprising that they are redoing this.
1778000	1781000	I'm surprised they would even do that.
1781000	1782000	I think it's great.
1782000	1785000	But seriously, when you're watching that trailer for the first time,
1785000	1788000	and SSJ100Matt, who is at the show, is saying in chat room,
1788000	1790000	PAX East blew up when I was there.
1790000	1792000	I can only imagine.
1792000	1793000	And how epic was that trailer?
1793000	1795000	Did you see the trailer they put out for it,
1795000	1797000	where it has those quotes that are like,
1797000	1800000	this is the series that defined a generation,
1800000	1802000	and all these inspirational quotes.
1802000	1805000	And then it says, come on everybody, sing along.
1805000	1807000	Did you see this Dark Sakura?
1807000	1808000	Oh.
1808000	1809000	No, I didn't.
1809000	1811000	Well then, now I have an excuse to play it.
1811000	1814000	Stop asking me for quotes, Tim Schafer.
1814000	1817000	You had an excuse already, Rob.
1817000	1820000	I'm going to give you the clip notes version, though, here, okay?
1820000	1826000	So, like, here's Capcom, and like the inspirational music,
1826000	1831000	and the few games are so rich with such a wealth of, right?
1831000	1833000	So it's like setting up for it.
1833000	1835000	And then, okay, so after all that.
1835000	1841000	Ready, sing along.
1841000	1845000	I like that it has the bopping head.
1845000	1846000	But look how it looks.
1846000	1848000	I mean, it looks awesome.
1848000	1856000	Yeah.
1856000	1857000	How can I cut this off early?
1857000	1860000	Like, I have to let it play.
1860000	1864000	The only thing I'm disappointed is they didn't show the moon.
1864000	1866000	Well, they got to keep something a secret.
1866000	1867000	They got to save something.
1867000	1870000	It looks like there was only Transylvania in there and one other stage.
1870000	1872000	Well, it also can't be complete.
1872000	1873000	Yeah, it's probably not done yet.
1873000	1874000	I didn't watch gameplay.
1874000	1876000	Apparently, they retweeted all the bosses, so they're harder now.
1876000	1877000	Nice.
1877000	1880000	Like, they have more sequences to them.
1880000	1883000	You have to remember, as awesome as the game as DuckTales was,
1883000	1885000	it really was only like six stages.
1885000	1887000	It was about as long as the first Mega Man game, right?
1887000	1888000	Yeah.
1888000	1891000	It wasn't a whole lot to it, so I don't know if they're like adding or whatever.
1891000	1895000	But seriously, when I just heard, I was like, oh, WayForward and Capcom?
1895000	1897000	Who brokered that deal?
1897000	1901000	Because that is like inspired genius for real.
1901000	1904000	Because WayForward did a great job with the Double Dragon Neon,
1904000	1906000	and they did some of these other remakes too.
1906000	1908000	They did the Contra game on DS.
1908000	1915000	They've done a lot of good stuff, and to trust them with DuckTales was genius.
1915000	1919000	So when I saw the trailer, I was just like, yes.
1919000	1924000	Didn't we all kind of go like, Capcom has made a lot of bad decisions in the past year,
1924000	1927000	and this is the first time where you're like, oh my god, I can like them again.
1927000	1929000	Like, we're sorry. Please love us.
1929000	1931000	It's cool to like Capcom again.
1931000	1933000	Here you go. Here's something you want to see.
1933000	1936000	Have WayForward redo Link to the Past.
1936000	1938000	Ah!
1938000	1940000	Or, let's just see if we can take that further.
1940000	1943000	Have them redo Super Metroid.
1943000	1947000	Go into some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1947000	1953000	Gamergirl says, LOL, I'm still laughing because I had the lyrics wrong for so long.
1953000	1957000	The trailer did kind of make a lot of you guys realize that, huh?
1957000	1961000	Yeah, but Dan regularly breaks into that theme song at my house,
1961000	1966000	so I have no excuse not to know that and the Darkwing Duck theme.
1966000	1971000	Extover says, I admit that I didn't play much of the original NES game since we only rented it once,
1971000	1973000	but I'm amused and excited by the remaster.
1973000	1976000	I didn't own it either, and I'm in the same boat.
1976000	1979000	We rented it like three times. I mean, you used to rent it all the time.
1979000	1983000	I think I did own the game. I want to say I did own that.
1983000	1987000	But that's what makes me more, because now that I'm an adult and I can buy whatever the hell I want,
1987000	1990000	I'm going to own this. It's going to be great.
1990000	1991000	Let's see.
1991000	1994000	I should actually text Dan and see if he knows about it.
1994000	1996000	Dark Tetsuya says, There's your list list.
1996000	1999000	Series WayForward needs to update for 2013.
1999000	2002000	That's a great idea, Dark Tetsuya. We're going to do that.
2002000	2004000	Maybe not tonight, but soon.
2005000	2006000	Let's see.
2008000	2011000	Act F says, The moon is going to sound so fucking awesome.
2011000	2013000	Technus says, $15, huh?
2013000	2016000	Yeah, it took five seconds for it to make me want to buy it.
2016000	2018000	Ditto. Ditto.
2019000	2022000	But here's the bottom line, as excited as we all are,
2022000	2025000	please don't fuck this up.
2025000	2028000	Like, this is sacred territory, people, right?
2028000	2030000	Please don't fuck this up.
2030000	2031000	Just say it.
2031000	2033000	Stop raping your childhood.
2033000	2035000	All right. Was that it on the start? Wasn't there another?
2035000	2036000	Yeah, that was it.
2036000	2037000	Did we talk about the other series?
2037000	2039000	The possibility that they said they were going to do
2039000	2041000	Rescue Rangers, possibly, and some of this other stuff?
2041000	2042000	Oh, God, that'd be awesome.
2042000	2045000	Yeah, no, it's in one of the other, I think it's in the second link.
2045000	2048000	They said that if this does well,
2048000	2051000	that there is the potential that they'll do, like,
2051000	2054000	Rescue Rangers and some of the other Capcom Disney stuff.
2054000	2057000	And I'm sitting there going, Mickey Mascarpane, Mickey Mascarpane.
2057000	2059000	Which is kind of basic, but I loved it.
2059000	2060000	You know what?
2060000	2063000	I literally tripped over that cartridge the other day.
2063000	2067000	Because Midna has been trying to get up on the shelves
2067000	2069000	to get to stuff, and she knocked it down.
2069000	2071000	It was in the case and everything.
2071000	2073000	Now, would this mean that maybe we'd start getting into
2073000	2075000	some of the later games, like Aladdin?
2075000	2077000	Yeah, that was one of the other things they said.
2077000	2081000	They said, Chippendale Rescue Rangers, Darkwing Duck, and Aladdin.
2081000	2083000	Darkwing Duck, I would be happy about.
2083000	2086000	SSJ-100 Matt says, from what I saw at the show,
2086000	2088000	they didn't mess it up.
2088000	2089000	Thank heavens.
2089000	2090000	Thank heavens.
2090000	2092000	Yeah, it looked good from what I saw.
2092000	2095000	They had the boss fight against, uh...
2095000	2097000	Who was it? Magica the Spell.
2097000	2098000	It was pretty awesome.
2098000	2099000	So excited.
2099000	2102000	I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.
2102000	2104000	Here's the other thing I wanted to say about this.
2104000	2106000	They need to make sweet, sweet Disney love.
2106000	2108000	I know we've got a Mega Man thing coming up later on,
2108000	2109000	but I have to bring this up.
2109000	2111000	Like, why not just let WayForward do Mega Man?
2113000	2114000	Dark Soccer.
2114000	2116000	That made me spaz so hard, I dropped my mic.
2116000	2117000	Like...
2117000	2118000	I know, right?
2118000	2120000	Why not just let them do Mega Man?
2120000	2125000	Because they'll probably do the game we all want, right?
2127000	2130000	So hopefully this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
2131000	2132000	We'll see.
2132000	2135000	Actually, you know who should really be doing the next Mega Man,
2135000	2136000	if they did one,
2136000	2139000	would be letting the people who did the Street Fighter
2140000	2141000	cross Mega Man.
2143000	2144000	Oh, the...
2144000	2145000	I know what you're talking about.
2145000	2147000	The anniversary of the freebie that was on the internet.
2147000	2148000	Yeah.
2148000	2149000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2149000	2150000	Maybe, maybe.
2151000	2153000	One of the other big games that came out of PAX East
2153000	2156000	was somewhat of a surprise announcement from Blizzard.
2157000	2159000	You know, I have the other show, Hoard House,
2159000	2161000	where we talk a lot about World of Warcraft and things,
2161000	2163000	and there were a lot of people thinking
2163000	2165000	that it was going to be, like, a big thing.
2165000	2167000	Like, it was going to be another expansion
2167000	2168000	or that it was Titan,
2168000	2171000	even though Blizzard said time and time again it's not Titan.
2171000	2173000	Well, it kind of did come out of left field.
2173000	2175000	This is not something people were predicting.
2175000	2177000	The game that Blizzard announced at PAX East
2177000	2180000	was called Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft.
2180000	2182000	It's a card game, basically.
2182000	2183000	It's a virtual card game.
2183000	2187000	It's going to be playable on PC, Mac, and iPad.
2187000	2192000	Kind of think very similar to that Magic the Gathering game
2192000	2195000	they have on, you know, Xbox and PlayStation and iPad.
2196000	2198000	But in fact, they even say,
2198000	2201000	hey, this is inspired partially out of our love of,
2201000	2203000	you know, Magic the Gathering and these other games.
2204000	2207000	But I'm getting the feeling this is going to be really simplified,
2207000	2210000	and obviously has Warcraft lore really woven into it.
2210000	2212000	Don't they have a card game already?
2213000	2214000	Blizzard?
2214000	2215000	Yeah.
2215000	2217000	They have a tangible, wow, trading card game.
2217000	2218000	That's what I meant.
2218000	2219000	But this isn't that.
2219000	2221000	I think it's a simpler version of that,
2221000	2223000	and it's not meant to be a tangible game.
2223000	2226000	It is a little weird because both of those exist,
2226000	2229000	but I think there's room for both.
2229000	2232000	I mean, if Magic the Gathering can be successful
2232000	2235000	in both a tangible game and an online game,
2235000	2239000	I don't see why Blizzard can't have two properties out there.
2239000	2240000	Now, here's the thing.
2240000	2243000	It is going to be a free game, but it's freemium.
2243000	2245000	You earn more cards.
2245000	2247000	You can earn them through playing the game,
2247000	2249000	and you win medals when you do PVP against people.
2249000	2253000	But you will also be able to buy expansion packs,
2253000	2255000	of course, with real money.
2255000	2257000	They're thinking about one dollar.
2257000	2259000	That's what they're thinking right now for the packs.
2259000	2262000	Hearthstone will have 300 cards in the initial collection,
2262000	2264000	and it's hero versus hero.
2264000	2267000	You play as one of the nine Central Warcraft classes,
2267000	2269000	each represented by a hero.
2269000	2270000	Thrall!
2270000	2273000	You can play, I believe Thrall is the shaman.
2273000	2275000	I know Anduin is the priest.
2275000	2277000	Malfurion, I think, is the druid.
2277000	2280000	You can play as one of the big characters,
2280000	2281000	and it looks really good.
2281000	2283000	Dark Saga, did you see this at all?
2283000	2286000	I think this is their trailer that talks about,
2286000	2288000	actually, let me see if I can find the match.
2288000	2290000	So that Jaina would be mage.
2290000	2293000	If you buy me a little time here, I'll try to find the...
2293000	2296000	Well, I'm broke, so I can't buy you anything.
2296000	2299000	But, well, I'm trying to think over who...
2299000	2302000	Here it is. Here's the gameplay video where it's...
2302000	2305000	I'm going to go kind of midway into this here.
2305000	2308000	Let me make this a little bigger so you can actually see it here.
2308000	2309000	Your turn.
2309000	2314000	You'll notice it's very cartoony and animated in the way it looks.
2314000	2316000	Oh, you've got little panda houses.
2316000	2319000	Yeah, it definitely has some of the newer...
2319000	2322000	Even though we only see old Warcraft characters in this,
2322000	2324000	it definitely has some of the newer inspired stuff.
2324000	2327000	I quit playing Magic for a reason.
2327000	2329000	Yeah, you don't think you'd be into this?
2329000	2331000	There was a time sink.
2331000	2335000	Now, Loki, I could see them wanting people like you
2335000	2338000	who don't touch any Blizzard IPs as of right now.
2338000	2340000	Someone like you would be great to get into this game.
2340000	2341000	Any interest in this for you?
2341000	2342000	Nope.
2342000	2343000	Why not?
2343000	2346000	I just don't care. I really don't care.
2346000	2348000	But you're not a big card game person.
2348000	2349000	No, I'm not.
2349000	2350000	Makes sense.
2350000	2352000	Well, I'll give it a try.
2352000	2354000	Some reason it reminds me of, like, Pagle.
2354000	2356000	I mean, the screen looks like Pagle.
2356000	2357000	Is it going to be free? Why not?
2357000	2359000	Yeah, that's where I'm at.
2359000	2361000	That's how they get you hooked.
2361000	2363000	There was a lot of people on Twitter that were like,
2363000	2365000	this is going to be stupid.
2365000	2368000	Well, at least they don't charge you to play it like Tetra Master.
2368000	2370000	That's where my mind went, too,
2370000	2373000	is I was like, oh, remember when Tetra Master was in Final Fantasy XI?
2373000	2375000	He had to pay like a dollar a month to play it.
2375000	2377000	God, I never touched that.
2377000	2379000	I did my 30-day free trial of Tetra Master,
2379000	2381000	and I think I maybe paid for one more month.
2381000	2382000	It was fun.
2382000	2383000	I didn't bother.
2383000	2385000	But it was like ten years ago, you know?
2385000	2389000	And, I mean, technology's come a long way.
2389000	2390000	I hated it.
2390000	2391000	I'll try this.
2391000	2393000	Yeah, I'll try this. Why not?
2393000	2396000	I download it. If it sucks, delete it.
2396000	2398000	It can't be worse than Yaris.
2398000	2400000	That's right. It already looks better than Yaris.
2400000	2402000	Ain't that the truth?
2402000	2404000	And then if I keep selling stuff in Diablo,
2404000	2406000	I can buy the expansion packs,
2406000	2408000	although that's exactly what Blizzard wants.
2408000	2410000	And I bet we're going to see more of this,
2410000	2413000	especially when the Titan thing is revealed, the MMO.
2413000	2416000	I bet there's going to be a lot of mini-
2416000	2419000	I bet there'll be real money woven into that somehow
2419000	2421000	in its own little economy,
2421000	2423000	where Blizzard gets a little chunk of it every time.
2423000	2427000	It's an extremely profitable avenue for them.
2427000	2430000	So, uh, yeah.
2430000	2432000	Let's move on with more news.
2432000	2435000	By the way, we will have-
2435000	2437000	Well, it's not a surprise to you anymore,
2437000	2438000	because I told you what it is.
2438000	2440000	We will have something special for the fifth-
2440000	2443000	for our, um, fifth, uh, centiversary.
2443000	2446000	I guess that's how it would be for hundreds.
2446000	2450000	Um, so here's glorious, beautiful news.
2450000	2452000	Rob, we need to have Ding Dong the Witch's Dead
2452000	2453000	playing in the background.
2453000	2458000	Um, but the, uh, CEO of EA, John Riccitello,
2458000	2460000	is that how you pronounce his name?
2460000	2463000	Is stepping down on the 30th.
2463000	2466000	Yay, because he has butchered some of our favorite stuff.
2466000	2469000	Um, basically the whole reason he's stepping down too
2469000	2473000	is because of fiscal, um, uh, depreciation in the company.
2473000	2480000	Um, yeah, and like, he's basically saying that it has to do,
2480000	2481000	and I'm going to read you the quote,
2481000	2484000	My decision to leave EA is really all about my accountability
2484000	2488000	for the shortcomings in our, uh, financial results this year.
2488000	2491000	It looks like we will likely come in at the low end
2491000	2496000	or slightly below the financial guidance we issued to the street.
2496000	2498000	So, yeah, and you know what?
2498000	2502000	I- you should have seen the wank on Twi- on a- on a Tumblr
2502000	2505000	when this- in the Mass Effect fan community.
2505000	2507000	It was glorious and beautiful,
2507000	2509000	and there were lots of dancing gifs.
2510000	2511000	Yep.
2524000	2526000	Oh my God, those clothes.
2526000	2528000	Is it really- is it really going to change anything?
2528000	2534000	Well, the people next in line, let's see, we have, um,
2534000	2537000	right now the interim leader is going to be Larry Probst,
2537000	2541000	who was the, uh, CEO from 1991 to 2007,
2541000	2547000	and likely candidates to replace, uh, is, uh, Frank Gibbo,
2547000	2549000	who is the president of EA Labels,
2549000	2552000	or their, um, COO Peter Moore,
2552000	2554000	who was, uh, once in charge of EA Sports
2554000	2556000	and worked for Microsoft during the Xbox 360 launch.
2556000	2557000	Ah, I could see Peter Moore, yeah, yeah.
2557000	2559000	Uh, let's see, Xtopher in chat says,
2559000	2561000	At least he took responsibility.
2561000	2563000	Uh, yeah, I mean, at least he was-
2563000	2566000	it- it wasn't as good as the Groupon guy's goodbye letter.
2566000	2568000	I don't know if you guys saw that a few weeks ago,
2568000	2569000	but that was good.
2569000	2571000	You know- you know shit's bad if Valve says no.
2571000	2575000	Uh, let's see, um, bonds006,
2575000	2576000	I have to agree with this comment in our chatroom,
2576000	2578000	live.vognetwork.com, uh,
2578000	2581000	Someone will take John's place and EA will be EA.
2581000	2582000	And I don't think this is really going to change it.
2582000	2584000	I think he's just the fall guy for, you know,
2584000	2586000	all this bam, bam, bam.
2586000	2590000	Star Wars Old Republic didn't do as well as it was supposed to.
2590000	2593000	Mass Effect 3's ending just, you know,
2593000	2594000	as much as I hate the link behind that.
2594000	2596000	Well, yeah, but you know- you know the-
2596000	2598000	the whole big rush on that, the pressure came from EA.
2598000	2600000	True, okay, true, good point.
2600000	2602000	Uh, and now SimCity, you know,
2602000	2604000	and all that, they had to give free games away.
2604000	2606000	He's just, uh, head of the Hydra.
2606000	2609000	On top of that, though, this is coming out right before, um,
2609000	2612000	well, right after they found out that they're gonna be next, um,
2612000	2615000	again on the top ten list of worst companies to work for.
2615000	2617000	So...
2617000	2620000	Not to mention that they are also in the running for,
2620000	2622000	and at least I haven't seen the voting, though, for it yet,
2622000	2624000	so I'm not sure if they've made it through the first round.
2624000	2628000	They're also on the, uh, list for worst company in America.
2628000	2630000	I- who cares?
2630000	2633000	I mean, isn't that all just a-
2633000	2636000	Yes, it's a popularity contest, or unpopularity contest.
2636000	2638000	It's an internet trolling contest.
2638000	2640000	It's the reverse of a popularity contest.
2640000	2643000	At any rate, I- I would like to be hopeful
2643000	2646000	to see better things come out, to see a new direction,
2646000	2649000	you know, to see them stop snatching up companies left and right
2649000	2651000	and ruining their, uh-
2651000	2653000	fixed goddamn origin.
2653000	2656000	I sat there for thirty- thirty minutes last night.
2656000	2660000	Myself, Alan, Shane, and Tim all wanted to play multiplayer, right?
2660000	2662000	So we're trying to play multiplayer Mass Effect,
2662000	2664000	but because Alan and I are in the same house,
2664000	2668000	we keep running into these problems where two of us can connect,
2668000	2670000	but then the others can't get in, it keeps timing out,
2670000	2673000	literally takes us thirty minutes to figure out,
2673000	2674000	we gotta crack the code.
2674000	2676000	Okay, here's how we form the game.
2676000	2678000	I'll host the game, then Alan, you join.
2679000	2682000	Now, Rob is gonna invite Tim, Alan will invite Shane,
2682000	2683000	and then it'll work.
2683000	2685000	That's what it took, honestly.
2685000	2688000	We had to mix and match the order of who joined when,
2688000	2691000	just to play stinkin' Mass Effect multiplayer.
2691000	2692000	Yeah.
2692000	2694000	Fix origin.
2694000	2696000	Do you want us to take it seriously?
2696000	2697000	More like butt-gin.
2697000	2698000	Oh.
2698000	2700000	But- but I'm- I'm still gonna-
2700000	2704000	I mean, honestly, I think that origin, in and of itself,
2704000	2706000	is a bad business decision to go through, but I mean,
2706000	2710000	it's like I was saying before, you know shit's bad when Valve refuses your money.
2710000	2712000	Well, but- but here's the thing, speaking of all that,
2712000	2716000	we have to remember Steam was pretty bad when it first launched,
2716000	2720000	everybody was pissed because it was bundled with Half-Life 2 and you had no choice,
2720000	2723000	there's a lot of that, so like, I wanna be hopeful and say,
2723000	2727000	maybe there's a light at the end of the tunnel and maybe this'll all turn out okay,
2727000	2729000	but I'm just- I just-
2729000	2731000	They keep fucking it up.
2731000	2733000	I just don't have that same level of trust in EA right now.
2733000	2735000	They keep fucking it up. End of the story.
2735000	2744000	And I mean, I love the entire Mass Effect series, even if there are-
2744000	2748000	I like- I like to joke around and call 3 a sparkly turd.
2748000	2752000	And there's lots of stuff in 3 that I love, I love the gameplay,
2752000	2755000	I love scenes, I love parts of the story.
2755000	2761000	It's just the whole lack of- what's the word I'm thinking of?
2762000	2770000	Continuity, really going from game to game, changing writing staff,
2770000	2773000	and you know that that pressure came from EA.
2773000	2776000	Dungeon Buster in our chat room, kind of with another perspective,
2776000	2778000	like what about the good things Rickatello did?
2778000	2782000	Dungeon Buster says the board probably forced him out,
2782000	2785000	EA stock has been on a brutal decline in the last few years,
2785000	2787000	I don't disagree with that for sure.
2787000	2790000	Dungeon Buster says Rickatello was also known for taking gambles
2790000	2794000	backing Dante's Inferno, Mirror's Edge, et cetera.
2794000	2798000	I mean, for better or for worse, those were some original games.
2798000	2801000	You know, I would say for better, Mirror's Edge, for worse.
2801000	2803000	Don't think that.
2803000	2805000	But for better or worse, got to work.
2808000	2811000	That's like asking what did Bush do good for the country?
2811000	2813000	Oh, I knew you'd take it down a political route.
2813000	2820000	No, but seriously, I think I remembered reading on one other article
2820000	2822000	that their stock increased after the announcement.
2824000	2825000	Just saying.
2825000	2829000	Let's see, Raginator in chat at live.vognetwork.com says
2829000	2831000	which is worse to work for?
2831000	2835000	EA, Gamestop, or Emperor Palpatine?
2835000	2837000	Which would be the worst to work for?
2837000	2839000	I'd probably say...
2840000	2842000	Mmm, that's really tough.
2842000	2843000	That was really tough.
2843000	2845000	I mean, at least with Palpatine, like,
2845000	2847000	you don't have to worry about being unemployed
2847000	2849000	because you'd just be dead.
2849000	2853000	Well, and as long as you're on the Death Star that they don't blow up,
2853000	2855000	you might have it pretty good.
2855000	2857000	Yeah, they fucked up every Death Star.
2857000	2859000	I don't know. EA's going to hire me at corporate or game,
2859000	2861000	so I was going to hire me at corporate.
2861000	2863000	Now, if you're working a death job on Coruscant, you're usually fine.
2863000	2864000	Just saying.
2864000	2868000	I'm not saying that, you know, they're that bad to work for.
2868000	2870000	But...
2871000	2876000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
2876000	2878000	use the passphrase, draw.
2878000	2880000	All right, let's move on with more news
2880000	2882000	because, Loki, I think you have something very related to this, right?
2882000	2884000	I mean, I know we're talking about, you know, Origin,
2884000	2886000	but what could they possibly fix with Origin?
2886000	2888000	I mean, Origin's perfect, right?
2888000	2889000	Uh...
2889000	2891000	Oh, wait, wait, wait, what's this?
2891000	2895000	Origin has an exploit where you can use hyperlinks to run malicious code?
2895000	2896000	No, that's not good.
2896000	2898000	Yes, apparently there is a way that, um...
2898000	2899000	What do you mean, run Origin?
2899000	2902000	No, it's not just running Origin, it's Origin Plus.
2902000	2903000	Uh, it's...
2903000	2904000	They have this stew...
2904000	2907000	And I don't even know why you would need this in the first place,
2907000	2909000	why this is even part of a feature or something,
2909000	2911000	but they have these URI hyperlinks
2911000	2914000	that basically you click on a link on a webpage or something like that,
2914000	2920000	it launches Origin and whatever game, you know, that it's specifying.
2920000	2923000	But on top of that, not only can you do that,
2923000	2926000	but you can also have these hyperlinks
2926000	2930000	and then have this, like, you know, command parameters and stuff.
2930000	2934000	So you can actually have, basically, you change the hyperlink
2934000	2937000	instead of saying, you know, Origin, launch game, blah, blah, blah.
2937000	2939000	It'll be Origin, launch game, blah, blah.
2939000	2942000	With this command parameter, I want you to open this, you know,
2942000	2944000	DLL at this IP address.
2944000	2946000	Well, that's not good.
2946000	2950000	And you're opening, you know, some sort of malicious file
2950000	2952000	on a remotely controlled server.
2952000	2954000	Because that's a thing that they have in there.
2954000	2957000	And I love their comment on it, though.
2957000	2960000	Our team is constantly investigating hypotheticals like this one
2960000	2963000	as we continually update our security infrastructure,
2963000	2967000	considering investigating or constantly investigating.
2967000	2970000	But I don't see a patch for this right now.
2970000	2973000	I mean, they know about it.
2973000	2974000	Just to say...
2974000	2976000	It's being worked on soon, trademark.
2976000	2979000	The best thing you can do is if you have like a web browser
2979000	2980000	or something like that,
2980000	2983000	if you haven't yet clicked on one of these URI links
2983000	2984000	or something like that,
2984000	2986000	one, you know, you get a prompt in like Firefox
2986000	2988000	or something like that that says, you know,
2988000	2992000	use this program to launch this type of file going forward.
2992000	2995000	Just have it say, you know, let me choose.
2995000	2997000	I mean, how often are you really going to be launching
2997000	2999000	URI links through your web browser?
2999000	3001000	Probably not very.
3001000	3004000	And then, of course, you know,
3004000	3007000	where they say they're constantly investigating stuff.
3008000	3011000	I got a wonder, though, is it...
3011000	3014000	Something very similar now with the Play for Free
3014000	3017000	or Battlefield Play for Free.
3017000	3020000	Very similar with that is they have another thing.
3020000	3023000	It's an exploit for older versions of Windows,
3023000	3025000	anything before Vista,
3025000	3029000	where someone can launch a mod file.
3029000	3032000	I guess it's used to customize games and settings.
3032000	3037000	And that mod file could queue also some malicious code
3037000	3039000	somewhere else.
3039000	3041000	So very similar, but with a whole different game,
3041000	3046000	not necessarily Origin, but that's not good.
3047000	3050000	And I guess they say that it's successful
3050000	3052000	because it overwrites a whitelist
3052000	3054000	that's supposed to restrict sites
3054000	3057000	because of this mod file or like a batch file
3057000	3058000	or something like that.
3058000	3061000	Yeah, they upload a malicious batch file.
3061000	3064000	They'll execute the next time the computer is restarted.
3066000	3067000	I don't know.
3067000	3068000	Fun!
3068000	3070000	That's kind of lame.
3070000	3073000	I mean, I'll keep your Windows updated, I guess,
3073000	3075000	but not everyone's going to be buying
3075000	3078000	Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Vista.
3078000	3081000	But there are people out there with Windows XP still.
3084000	3086000	Who has it better, the people with Windows XP
3086000	3089000	or the people with Windows 8?
3089000	3091000	I'm just trolling.
3091000	3093000	Windows 8 apparently isn't that bad, really.
3093000	3095000	I'm glad I don't have it.
3095000	3099000	I had to use it on my wife's sister's laptop
3099000	3100000	to try to like...
3100000	3102000	I don't like how everything's arranged in there.
3102000	3104000	It's very odd.
3104000	3106000	But I mean, I'm sure it's a little bit of a learning curve.
3106000	3108000	But yeah, the regular desktop's there.
3108000	3110000	It's just... it's odd.
3110000	3112000	I don't know. That's the best way I could describe it.
3115000	3118000	Well, I know you play Origin every day, Loki,
3118000	3120000	so you have a lot to be worried about with this.
3120000	3122000	No, I have not installed Origin at all.
3122000	3125000	I know I probably have somewhere like an EA account
3125000	3129000	because I did for Burnout Paradise.
3129000	3131000	I think it's Paradise.
3131000	3133000	But I have yet to...
3133000	3135000	You know whose fault it is I have Origin on PC, right?
3135000	3137000	Shane's. Totally Shane's fault.
3137000	3138000	Yeah, Shane.
3138000	3140000	Didn't you play Burnout Paradise way back in the day?
3140000	3142000	Way back in the day, too, though.
3142000	3144000	Didn't you play Burnout Paradise way back in the day?
3144000	3146000	Yeah, but that was not my PC. It was on Xbox.
3146000	3148000	With oodles and oodles of love,
3148000	3150000	thank you for introducing me to the series.
3151000	3153000	Alright, I probably would have had to do it eventually
3153000	3154000	because Alan's a big PC.
3154000	3156000	He doesn't really play stuff on consoles anymore.
3156000	3160000	But anyway, let's talk about better news
3160000	3162000	and things that put a smile on your face
3162000	3165000	as opposed to angry little, you know,
3165000	3168000	slanted eyebrows that indicate an angry face.
3168000	3170000	I have a sound for that face.
3170000	3172000	Yes, face.
3172000	3175000	This is actually really exciting news.
3175000	3176000	I was very happy to hear this.
3176000	3180000	The Final Fantasy X HD remaster on PlayStation 3,
3180000	3183000	it's going to include Final Fantasy X-2,
3183000	3185000	which I think is great.
3185000	3188000	That is as reported in Jump Magazine.
3188000	3190000	Both games based on the International Edition,
3190000	3195000	and yes, apparently both are getting that HD remaster treatment.
3195000	3198000	Because they're both the same engine.
3198000	3201000	The first trailer for Final Fantasy X just hit,
3201000	3203000	I think today, so you can actually check that out.
3203000	3204000	It looks nice.
3204000	3206000	I will definitely be picking this up.
3206000	3209000	I love that both these games are on one disc for PlayStation 3.
3209000	3213000	Now the Vita, the Vita will be getting both these games,
3213000	3215000	but they have to be purchased separately.
3215000	3217000	However, the games are supposed to come out this year,
3217000	3218000	which is pretty exciting.
3218000	3219000	That'll be fun.
3219000	3222000	And yet another reason to not get a PlayStation 4,
3222000	3225000	where there's all this good stuff still coming out on PlayStation 3.
3225000	3227000	Maybe I'll actually beat one of them.
3228000	3229000	You know what my problem was?
3229000	3231000	I breezed all the way through both of them
3231000	3232000	and still wasn't high enough level.
3232000	3233000	I didn't really play.
3233000	3236000	I mean, I watched you, I think, play some of X-2,
3236000	3238000	and I've certainly seen my fair share of YouTubes.
3238000	3240000	I didn't really play a lot of X-2.
3240000	3243000	So I'm kind of, I'd like to give it a fair shot.
3243000	3246000	Well, I mean, if you had let me know this,
3246000	3247000	I would have just loaned you my copy.
3247000	3248000	Yeah.
3248000	3250000	Well, I've also got X International.
3251000	3252000	So.
3252000	3253000	ActDeftInChat says,
3253000	3255000	Final Fantasy X sucks though.
3255000	3256000	Wrong.
3256000	3257000	Incorrect.
3257000	3260000	I see where people take issue to it.
3260000	3261000	I do get the issues with it.
3261000	3262000	What can I do for you?
3263000	3267000	But as the game itself, I really like it.
3268000	3270000	That's where every gamer has a voice
3270000	3272000	and everybody gets their own opinion,
3272000	3273000	even when they're wrong.
3273000	3274000	DarkSakura.
3274000	3276000	Even when they're being a butt.
3276000	3278000	No, I didn't mean that.
3278000	3279000	Only minorly.
3279000	3281000	So here's some good news,
3281000	3283000	and I actually have to thank CatastrophicMaggie
3283000	3286000	for sharing some nice stuff with me.
3287000	3291000	The European Wii U eShop lifted the age restriction
3291000	3292000	that they were having, you know,
3292000	3294000	where you can only buy the games after like,
3294000	3295000	what, nine o'clock?
3295000	3296000	Yeah, it was.
3296000	3297000	Yeah, you can only buy them after.
3297000	3298000	Oh, after eleven.
3298000	3300000	On the Wii U eShop.
3300000	3301000	All night.
3303000	3304000	What was her name?
3304000	3305000	Rhonda Shear.
3305000	3307000	I still remember that show.
3307000	3308000	Rhonda Shear.
3308000	3309000	Oh my God.
3309000	3310000	You know what?
3310000	3311000	She was hilarious.
3311000	3313000	So I've watched every single Toxic Avenger movie
3313000	3315000	thanks to Rhonda Shear.
3315000	3316000	Just saying.
3318000	3321000	But yeah, it had to do with German law.
3321000	3322000	Hold on, hold on.
3322000	3323000	This is very important.
3323000	3326000	Hi, it's Rhonda, and we'll be watching
3326000	3332000	Hats and Surf Nazis Must Die next on USA Up All Night.
3337000	3339000	Yeah, it wasn't because of the voice that I remembered that.
3342000	3344000	The 80s hair and the...
3344000	3346000	No, it wasn't the hair.
3346000	3347000	It was not the hair.
3348000	3351000	Even I have to look at that and go, damn.
3351000	3352000	What's she doing now?
3352000	3353000	Now I'm gonna have to Wikipedia.
3353000	3354000	Oh, great, Rob.
3354000	3355000	Thank you.
3355000	3356000	Car shows, I'm sure.
3357000	3358000	Rhonda Shear.
3359000	3362000	Anyway, so yeah, I think it's really hilarious
3362000	3364000	that we're talking about her and Germany.
3364000	3365000	Oh, she died.
3365000	3366000	Did she?
3366000	3367000	No, I just made that up.
3367000	3368000	Fuck you.
3372000	3373000	Okay.
3373000	3374000	And you said I couldn't troll people.
3374000	3376000	She's had some surgery too.
3376000	3379000	Let's see, her last film that she did in 2003,
3379000	3380000	Prison A Go-Go.
3380000	3381000	Fun.
3381000	3386000	But let's see, she's been doing Sheer Intimates LLC.
3386000	3388000	So she's doing panties basically.
3388000	3392000	In 2010, Rhonda designed the Abra.
3392000	3394000	Isn't that a Pokemon?
3394000	3395000	Makes sense, yeah.
3395000	3396000	Isn't that a Pokemon?
3396000	3397000	What does the Abra do?
3397000	3399000	And the product was an overnight success.
3399000	3402000	The Abra is the number one selling bra worldwide.
3402000	3404000	That reads like a sales pitch.
3404000	3406000	She plans to add cosmetic swimwear fragrance
3406000	3408000	and boomer hottie into, I think that's,
3408000	3410000	somebody just edited that fucking article.
3411000	3413000	I want to know what the Abra is now.
3413000	3415000	Charity work, since we're giving her a hard time.
3415000	3418000	In 2011, Rhonda was the event chair and a sponsor
3418000	3421000	for American Cancer Society's Making Strides
3421000	3423000	Put On Your Pink Bra event.
3424000	3426000	If I remember correctly from my infomercials,
3426000	3429000	the Abra is a bra that you don't see the bra lines.
3430000	3432000	Uh, I just went to look it up.
3432000	3433000	Loki?
3433000	3435000	Oh, dude, this is things that they sell at the
3435000	3436000	seen on TV store.
3436000	3438000	You guys, Loki knows what an Abra is.
3438000	3440000	I watch TV, okay?
3441000	3443000	Yes, infomercials.
3443000	3445000	I also know what a slap chop is.
3445000	3446000	What is a slap chop?
3446000	3448000	A slap chop is a thing that you can chop garlic in.
3448000	3449000	I own one.
3449000	3451000	And I had the knockoff brand, it sucked.
3451000	3453000	Because the garlic is stuck up in the goddamn thing.
3453000	3455000	USA chop all night.
3456000	3457000	Yes.
3459000	3463000	Um, so, can I go back to the story that I was trying
3463000	3465000	so professionally to discuss?
3465000	3467000	No, because I'm reading a comment from Marissa
3467000	3469000	in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
3469000	3470000	Marissa, do you have an Abra?
3470000	3471000	Uh, Marissa says,
3471000	3475000	Abra is a lazy, saggy bra for wusses.
3476000	3478000	Yes, according to their website-
3478000	3480000	Well, then again, she has utas brasiers.
3480000	3481000	According to their website, it says,
3481000	3484000	Say goodbye to pinching, binding, chafing, and discomfort.
3484000	3487000	Prevents bra bulge and underarm cleavage.
3487000	3490000	Fits perfectly even if you gain or lose weight.
3490000	3491000	It's a chest girdle.
3491000	3492000	And it's machine washable.
3492000	3493000	Can I get an aw-
3493000	3494000	You know what?
3494000	3495000	Can I get an aw brief?
3495000	3496000	You know what, first of all?
3496000	3497000	What?
3497000	3499000	I have a comfortable bra.
3499000	3500000	Just saying.
3500000	3502000	And I can wash it in the washing machine!
3502000	3505000	It looks like a tank top made out of spandex
3505000	3506000	or something like that.
3506000	3507000	It's like, bulgy boob cups.
3507000	3509000	Alright, back to the stuff, video games.
3509000	3511000	It's a boob girdle.
3512000	3514000	What gamers really want to know.
3514000	3515000	Boobs.
3516000	3517000	I don't know, look at our demographic.
3517000	3518000	Anyway.
3518000	3520000	Um, so yeah.
3520000	3522000	Basically they made some, uh,
3522000	3524000	I guess they had to have discussed something
3524000	3525000	with the German government
3525000	3527000	or found some loophole to get out of it.
3527000	3529000	But now you can, uh,
3529000	3531000	you can shop for games before 11.
3531000	3534000	Now I imagine she's talking about the aw bra.
3534000	3536000	They had to make a deal with the German government
3536000	3537000	in order to be able to sell it.
3537000	3541000	First of all, they had to strike a deal with David Hasselhoff.
3542000	3546000	Because he secretly uses the aw bra for his man boobs.
3547000	3548000	Awesome.
3548000	3549000	I'm done.
3549000	3551000	I'm leaving the room done.
3551000	3552000	Bye.
3553000	3554000	God.
3554000	3556000	Alright, uh,
3556000	3558000	let's travel around the world and check-
3558000	3560000	But we need to get Marissa to call in
3560000	3562000	and do Utz's brassieres now.
3562000	3565000	Well, we also have the PAX East calls tonight.
3565000	3567000	I have to keep it on topic a little bit,
3567000	3569000	but Marissa's more than welcome to come to episode 500.
3569000	3571000	Anyway, uh, release dates.
3571000	3572000	Let's travel around the world
3572000	3575000	and check out what is coming out in a lingerie store near you.
3575000	3576000	Loki.
3576000	3578000	Uh, today, uh, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,
3578000	3580000	Gates to Infinity, and 3DS,
3580000	3583000	and I believe today was also...
3583000	3584000	Luigi's Mansion.
3584000	3586000	Yeah, it's Luigi's Mansion.
3586000	3588000	I can't remember if that was earlier than today or today.
3588000	3590000	Anyways, so there was that.
3590000	3593000	And then, of course, next week, also some big stuff.
3593000	3597000	Bioshock Infinite on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3597000	3600000	Of course, um, Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel
3600000	3602000	on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3602000	3608000	WRC-FIA World Rally Championship 2012 on PlayStation 3.
3608000	3610000	Uh, Final Fantasy XI,
3610000	3614000	The Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition on Xbox 360
3614000	3616000	on PC and 360.
3616000	3619000	Final Fantasy XI, Seekers of Alduin.
3619000	3625000	Um, Tiger Woods, PGA Tour 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3625000	3627000	Also, the Master's Historic Edition
3627000	3630000	if you really want to spend extra money for a few extra courses.
3630000	3633000	And...
3633000	3635000	I believe that's it.
3635000	3638000	Let's go to Japan and check out the release dates over there.
3638000	3640000	On the PlayStation 3 on March 28th,
3640000	3643000	Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel comes out on PlayStation 3,
3643000	3646000	as well as Sengoku Basara Triple Pack.
3646000	3650000	I am assuming that is all three games in the, uh,
3650000	3654000	it's Sengoku Basara 3, Utage, and HD Collection
3654000	3656000	are all the games that are that.
3656000	3658000	Uh, what series is this? Is this...
3658000	3663000	That would be Three Kingdoms, Sengoku...
3663000	3665000	Sengoku Basara is Devil Kings over here.
3665000	3668000	Thank you. I was like, I know it's over here, but it's...
3668000	3670000	It's the Capcom Fantasy Warriors game.
3670000	3673000	It's a little more, like, cultish over here, I guess, for lack of a better term.
3673000	3675000	They don't release any over here, that's why.
3675000	3677000	I thought, no, they have Devil Kings.
3677000	3679000	They had Devil Kings on PlayStation 2,
3679000	3681000	and then they had Sengoku Basara on the Wii,
3681000	3685000	and PlayStation 3, like, a couple years ago.
3686000	3689000	Uh, the Final Fantasy XI expansion makes its way to Japan as well,
3689000	3693000	and the Xbox 360, for all you guys playing it on the 360 in Japan.
3693000	3695000	Uh, as well as Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel,
3695000	3698000	Cave Shooting Collection, that ought to be pretty good,
3698000	3700000	and Love Torre Chocolate.
3700000	3702000	And the Cave Shooting Collection, by the way,
3702000	3706000	since it is a Cave title, I believe those are region-free.
3706000	3707000	Nice.
3708000	3711000	What, is that something that might come to the store, then?
3711000	3712000	Um, I'm sure that...
3712000	3714000	Some of them hit the, uh, direct download.
3714000	3716000	Well, Cave, the Shooting Collection,
3716000	3719000	I mean, all the Cave titles have been out on Xbox Live Arcade.
3719000	3720000	Okay.
3720000	3722000	I want to say that it's, um...
3722000	3724000	Probably...
3724000	3726000	They probably will bring it over here.
3726000	3728000	Axis Games might bring it over.
3728000	3730000	Axis or... Yeah.
3730000	3732000	Yeah, it would be Axis Games, I think. They would be the ones.
3732000	3734000	By the way, I looked up Basara.
3734000	3738000	It means crazy or over-the-top, but also stylish.
3739000	3742000	Better than Basura in Spanish.
3742000	3744000	What does that mean? Junk? Trash?
3744000	3745000	Trash, yeah.
3745000	3749000	Alright, uh, PlayStation Vita this week in Japan.
3749000	3754000	On the 28th, Oboro Muramasa comes out this week from Marvelous Entertainment.
3754000	3755000	It has to do with a sword.
3755000	3758000	Muramasa Rebirth, the remake.
3758000	3762000	Seimadu Monogatari comes out as well from Compile.
3762000	3763000	Compile! Yay!
3763000	3765000	Who needs to remake the Guardian Legend somehow.
3765000	3766000	Cotton!
3766000	3767000	Alright.
3767000	3768000	And Guardian Legend.
3768000	3769000	Yes.
3769000	3772000	Lastly, but not leastly, on the 3DS this week,
3772000	3774000	Nano Assault gets a price reduction,
3774000	3782000	and Shoshinsha Kata Nai Honnichi Made Soroban Anzan Flash Anzan.
3782000	3784000	That's a mouthful. What game is this?
3784000	3785000	Duff.
3785000	3789000	No pictures of it, but the related games are all, like...
3789000	3790000	Puppies.
3790000	3792000	Puppies and Kitty Cafe and things like that,
3792000	3793000	so it's one of those games.
3793000	3797000	Alright, how about the UK? Dark Sakura?
3797000	3798000	Some stuff.
3798000	3804000	In the UK, we have, starting with the 26th, we have Bioshock Infinite.
3804000	3808000	On the 27th, Lego City Undercover and Sly Cooper Thieves in Time.
3808000	3813000	The 28th, we have Luigi's Mansion 2 and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14.
3813000	3815000	And on the 29th, we have Army of Four.
3815000	3817000	That's it.
3817000	3819000	There you go. Just a couple more news stories for you guys,
3819000	3821000	and then the classic game of the week.
3821000	3822000	But first, Loki.
3822000	3827000	Now, even though War Z may try to convince you that they were part of this program,
3827000	3831000	they actually don't have this program out yet, or they just started it.
3831000	3832000	It's the early access program.
3832000	3838000	It allows you to play and purchase games that are still in development.
3838000	3843000	They have a few games, starting off with Arma 3 and Star Forge.
3843000	3849000	Also, a game I think should be at least a nominee for the best title of a game in 2013,
3849000	3851000	Drunken Robot Pornography.
3851000	3853000	Sign me up.
3853000	3855000	I mean, that sounds awesome.
3855000	3860000	Yes, and then, let's see, was it Kenshi?
3860000	3864000	Kenshi, an open-ended squad-based strategy RPG.
3864000	3866000	That's too big of a subtitle.
3866000	3867000	I'm sorry.
3867000	3869000	You're going to have to change that.
3869000	3871000	Basically, so, yeah.
3871000	3874000	They're going to add features, and stuff will be available over time.
3874000	3878000	Plus, I guess you'll be able to maybe provide some feedback for the titles.
3878000	3880000	But that's kind of cool that you can do that.
3880000	3885000	Arma 3, I actually kind of want to try that, but Arma's so simulation
3885000	3888000	that I just would want to mod the hell out of it, you know,
3888000	3890000	get laser beams and stuff.
3890000	3891000	That'd be ridiculous.
3891000	3895000	I kind of like that whole idea about getting in early on the game's development
3895000	3898000	and kind of getting to give that instant feedback,
3898000	3901000	and maybe your angry internet comments really can influence the game.
3901000	3902000	Yeah.
3902000	3903000	Kind of neat.
3903000	3906000	Especially in this Kickstarter world we live in now,
3906000	3909000	this seems like a great place to launch a project that started on Kickstarter
3909000	3913000	where your investors, essentially, really can have their say on the game's development.
3913000	3914000	There is one I saw.
3914000	3915000	It wasn't Kickstarter.
3915000	3917000	It was another.
3917000	3919000	I don't know if they were doing it through their own website.
3919000	3920000	No.
3920000	3924000	It was, actually, it was a train simulation game.
3924000	3928000	But the difference was is they were asking people to crowdfund it,
3928000	3932000	but the people that crowdfunded it also get a portion of the profits
3932000	3934000	that they receive from the game.
3934000	3938000	So you're profit sharing, I guess, which is kind of cool.
3938000	3941000	That'd be kind of neat to do with Kickstarter.
3941000	3943000	Hmm.
3943000	3944000	I might have missed it.
3944000	3947000	Are there any games you're looking forward to being a part of with this?
3947000	3949000	No.
3949000	3951000	Not right now.
3951000	3953000	I mean, Arma 3 looks kind of cool.
3953000	3956000	I may have to check out robot, you know, the robot pornography game
3956000	3959000	because that's an awesome title, and I like giant robot games,
3959000	3962000	so it'd be interesting to check out.
3962000	3964000	It'd be interesting to check out.
3964000	3965000	All right.
3965000	3968000	Well, one more story for you guys, and I alluded to this earlier
3968000	3970000	when we were talking about DuckTales,
3970000	3972000	but there was some talk about Mega Man at PAX East
3972000	3974000	at the World of Capcom panel.
3974000	3977000	Brett Elston, the Capcom community manager,
3977000	3980000	said that Capcom is developing a new game in the Mega Man series,
3980000	3983000	but they're not ready to fully announce it just yet.
3983000	3985000	I think this is kind of a duh.
3985000	3987000	I mean, despite the canceled projects,
3987000	3990000	I mean, like, would you really just drop something like Mega Man?
3990000	3992000	No, I think you put it to bed for a few years,
3992000	3994000	and then it comes back better than ever, right?
3994000	3996000	That's probably what's happening here.
3996000	4000000	However, since this story first broke on the internet,
4000000	4005000	Capcom kind of came behind the community manager here and said,
4005000	4009000	now, now, now, now, no Mega Man game has been confirmed.
4009000	4012000	The company is having ongoing discussions about Mega Man,
4012000	4015000	but it won't announce anything until something is ready.
4015000	4018000	So don't hold your breath that that's necessarily this year.
4018000	4020000	It could be a long time.
4020000	4022000	Now, Shane was sending me some private messages
4022000	4025000	when we were talking about the whole DuckTales and WayForward thing
4025000	4027000	and saying, what else should WayForward do?
4027000	4032000	And Shane was reminding me, Rob, WayForward doesn't always strike gold.
4032000	4035000	Let's pull up WayForward's resume
4035000	4038000	and see some of the other games that they've done in the past.
4038000	4042000	Godzilla Domination on the Game Boy Advance,
4042000	4046000	SpongeBob SquarePants Lights Camera Pants,
4046000	4048000	the A Boy and His Blob on the Wii,
4048000	4050000	although, to be fair, I never really gave that a try,
4050000	4051000	so I don't know how.
4051000	4053000	I really wanted to play that too because I love the first one.
4053000	4056000	Let's see, the Silent Hill Book of Memories game on the Vita,
4056000	4058000	but see, Shane didn't like that.
4058000	4060000	I didn't think it was terrible.
4060000	4063000	I just didn't think it was great, but it's decent.
4063000	4065000	It wasn't very Silent Hilly, was it?
4065000	4070000	But here, here's the biggest sin WayForward has ever committed.
4070000	4071000	You ready for this?
4071000	4074000	A Nintendo DS game called Ping Pals.
4074000	4075000	Oh.
4075000	4078000	Do you remember this game?
4078000	4079000	Yes.
4079000	4081000	I didn't play it, but I remember.
4081000	4084000	It was like somebody put out PictoChat as a game.
4084000	4086000	But how long ago was that?
4086000	4088000	2004, glad you asked.
4088000	4091000	I mean, think about it.
4091000	4093000	They've done their time.
4093000	4095000	They did their time in jail.
4095000	4098000	They've learned their lesson.
4098000	4103000	They made some bad mistakes as kids, and now they're adults.
4103000	4107000	Do I have Queen's We Are the Champions going through my head?
4107000	4110000	Okay, let's look at their more recent resume.
4110000	4113000	So there's Silent Hill Book of Memories, the Adventure Time game,
4113000	4115000	Hey Ice King, Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?
4115000	4117000	Yeah, that was fantastic.
4117000	4120000	Mighty Switch Force Hyperdrive Edition, which was actually pretty good.
4120000	4122000	Double Dragon Neon, which was great.
4122000	4126000	Blood Rain Betrayal.
4126000	4129000	Considering the source material, yeah.
4130000	4134000	And Shantae, I keep wanting to say Shantae.
4134000	4136000	Shantae, you stay.
4136000	4138000	Shantae, Risky's Revenge.
4138000	4140000	That's supposed to be pretty good.
4140000	4145000	Okay, so they made a few mistakes as kids.
4145000	4149000	I did want to mention, because I do happen to follow them on Facebook,
4149000	4153000	the 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3,
4153000	4160000	They did post a wonderful update regarding a fan-made game in the Mega Man series.
4160000	4162000	It's called The Master System.
4162000	4167000	It's an action brawler game based in the Mega Man Legends series.
4167000	4171000	They have two unique characters, and you fight a bunch of the Reaverbots.
4171000	4174000	And you can check it out for free right now.
4174000	4183000	It's arcade.legends-station.com?sp equals Master System.
4183000	4188000	So check it out, or follow the 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3,
4188000	4193000	which they are now 101,000 strong.
4193000	4195000	Just saying.
4195000	4198000	101,000.
4198000	4202000	Tigerclaw in chat linking us to some Ping Pals gameplay.
4202000	4204000	Check that out.
4204000	4208000	Where you have an actual little keyboard you can type on, or you can draw,
4208000	4212000	and you have coins to buy stuff for your avatar.
4212000	4214000	But here's the thing with Ping Pals, man.
4214000	4217000	Can you imagine? Remember there was that Boyfriend Simulator game
4217000	4222000	that had the really fucked up chatbot engine that was in there?
4222000	4224000	It will say some weird shit to you.
4224000	4227000	If they re-released that game with that in there, that could actually be entertaining.
4227000	4229000	Here's the thing about Ping Pals.
4229000	4232000	Just trying to cut this game a little slack.
4232000	4235000	What if, when this game started development,
4235000	4238000	they didn't know that Nintendo was going to put PictoChat into the system?
4238000	4240000	What if there had been no PictoChat?
4240000	4243000	Would we be giving Ping Pals such shit?
4243000	4245000	I think we might still be a little bit less.
4245000	4247000	A little bit less.
4247000	4248000	But a little bit less, yeah.
4248000	4251000	I don't think we'd remember it quite as horrifically as we do, because...
4251000	4253000	It wouldn't seem as ridiculous.
4253000	4254000	Yeah.
4254000	4257000	Alright, well, let's go back to a much simpler time.
4257000	4262000	Let's go back before WayForward and all this stuff, before even Ping Pals.
4262000	4265000	We're going to go back to a much simpler time in a segment we call
4265000	4267000	The Classic Game of the Week,
4267000	4269000	where Dark Soccer is going to walk into the gaming vault
4269000	4271000	and find a game that she thinks,
4271000	4275000	Hey, you kids and your frickin' HD reboots.
4275000	4278000	In this case it's, Hey, I can't believe I haven't done this one yet.
4278000	4281000	Go play this pixelated classic and love it.
4281000	4283000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4283000	4285000	Eternal Champions.
4285000	4287000	How have I never done this?
4287000	4290000	You say that every week. How have I never done this?
4290000	4293000	I was sitting down trying to go through all of the...
4293000	4295000	Oh, fuck.
4295000	4296000	I hate...
4296000	4297000	Do your... Read your thing.
4297000	4300000	Anyway, so anyway, Eternal Champions came out in 1993.
4300000	4308000	It was a 2D fighting game, and they came out for the Mega Drive or Sega Genesis that same year.
4308000	4313000	And it was sort of like a Mortal Kombat-y type of thing,
4313000	4319000	where there were over-kills and special moves and things.
4319000	4322000	But it did spawn like one of the best sequels ever,
4322000	4325000	which was Eternal Champions Challenge for the Dark Side,
4325000	4328000	which was basically the Sega CD version.
4328000	4332000	And two other spin-offs, there was a...
4332000	4334000	It's just set in that universe,
4334000	4337000	and it's also out on the Wii Virtual Console account in 2007.
4337000	4340000	So basically, it's just this typical fighting game.
4340000	4342000	I mean, it works a lot like Street Fighter II.
4342000	4348000	It uses the six-button controller, though, so that you can have the different ones.
4348000	4352000	And the version of this that I have, I got with Sega Activator.
4352000	4353000	Do you remember the Activator?
4353000	4355000	Oh, he had one of those Activators.
4355000	4357000	He was trying to build a Para Para machine out of it.
4357000	4359000	Yeah, I think I threw it away.
4359000	4361000	I'm gonna tell you how we got our Activator.
4361000	4366000	Right before Virgin went out of business, we bought it for eight bucks.
4366000	4368000	A Genesis Activator.
4368000	4372000	So that's how we have our copy.
4372000	4375000	When was that long ago when Virgin Megastore went out of business?
4375000	4379000	It was very soon after I moved out here.
4379000	4380000	Wow, okay.
4380000	4382000	Longer than ten years ago.
4382000	4385000	I guess you're right. It seems like that wasn't that long ago.
4385000	4386000	Of course I'm right. It's me.
4386000	4390000	So basically, you block by holding away.
4390000	4393000	Like I said, very Street Fighter, you don't have an actual block button.
4394000	4397000	But if you get hit several times in a row, you get dizzy, and then your opponent gets a free attack.
4397000	4399000	Blah, blah, blah. The usual stuff.
4399000	4406000	You also had a special attack meter, so that you could do different specials.
4406000	4408000	And then you had your overkills.
4408000	4413000	And that was stage specific.
4413000	4415000	I'm getting tongue tied today.
4415000	4421000	These are basically, you have to defeat your opponent where they fall in a certain area of the ground.
4421000	4424000	If they land in the right spot, the life bars disappear.
4424000	4427000	And something in the background kills them to death.
4427000	4428000	Like for example...
4428000	4430000	Wow, this person just got set on fire.
4430000	4431000	Yeah.
4431000	4432000	Awesome.
4432000	4436000	If you're, you can get vaporized by neon sign and shadows level.
4436000	4440000	A Tyrannosaurus can kill you and slash a level.
4440000	4443000	Good lord, that goes on forever.
4443000	4449000	Not only did the guy get set on fire, but then you see a skeleton, and then the head falls off the skeleton.
4449000	4450000	Like...
4450000	4451000	Yeah.
4451000	4452000	Ew.
4452000	4454000	There's a drive by shooting in Larsen's level.
4454000	4457000	And a napalm bomb in Midnight's level.
4457000	4463000	So yeah, there were a bunch of characters, and I'm gonna go through the character list real quick.
4463000	4465000	Just because some of them had some fun names.
4465000	4470000	And there were some of the, I thought some of the better characters were in the second one.
4470000	4476000	But you had Shadow Miyamoto, Rax Coswell, Jonathan Blade, Jetta Max.
4476000	4480000	Slash Trident, Xavier Pendragon, Mitchell Middleton Knight, who was Midnight.
4480000	4482000	Haha, with a K.
4482000	4484000	Larsen Tyler, the Eternal Champion.
4484000	4487000	You had Chin Wo, Dawson McShane, who was kind of fun.
4487000	4494000	Ramses the Third, Raven Gendar, Senator, and Riptide De Medici.
4494000	4498000	People love to hate on those De Medicis, I swear, but they were all busy killing each other and being Pope.
4498000	4501000	Then you had Blast Chavez, and then some animals.
4501000	4503000	This game looks kind of derpy though.
4503000	4505000	It is kind of derpy, but it was classic.
4506000	4508000	Fair enough, fair enough.
4508000	4510000	Classically derpy.
4510000	4515000	There was the Slurpee flavor that was Sega Eternal Champions Cherry.
4515000	4518000	And it was at 7-Eleven, of course.
4518000	4522000	Then there were game books that came out that were released by Puffin Books.
4522000	4534000	There was a comic about this that was called Eternal Champions Special that was done by the UK Sega Magazine, Sonic the Comic.
4535000	4540000	Do you remember the group Bone Thugs and Harmony?
4540000	4542000	Yes, I do.
4542000	4551000	They basically sampled Eternal Champions for their songs Eternal and Crossroad.
4551000	4556000	Really? Crossroad samples Eternal Champions? That was like their biggest hit.
4556000	4562000	And Courage the Cowardly Dog also used some of the same audio loops from the game.
4563000	4570000	EGM actually sponsored Eternal Champions tournaments, which I remember a few people...
4570000	4576000	I think I knew one person who actually was in one of those a while back, but don't quote me on that.
4576000	4580000	And then, like I said, it came with the Activator.
4580000	4585000	There is a special moves edition that was a handheld tiger game.
4585000	4589000	It basically was just a really crappy version of Eternal Champions.
4590000	4594000	And basically it was a pretty mediocre game.
4594000	4598000	I mean, I thought that the Sega CD one was better.
4598000	4610000	And then they were going to do Eternal Champions the Final Chapter for the Saturn, but they cancelled it so that they could push Virtua Fighter in the US.
4610000	4614000	I would like to know if there is a prototype of this sitting around because I would love to see it.
4614000	4618000	So yeah, as far as the spin-offs, there was one called Chicago Syndicate.
4618000	4626000	It came out on the Game Gear in 1995 that was based on an alternate reality where Lars and Tyler didn't die in 1920.
4626000	4630000	And then there's Expert X-PERTS.
4630000	4636000	There's a side-scrolling beat-em-up that is based on one where Shadow Yamato didn't die.
4636000	4639000	So, yeah.
4639000	4641000	Eternal Champions.
4641000	4643000	Overkill.
4643000	4645000	I think this one you get eaten by a shark.
4645000	4647000	Yeah, I'm waiting to see if they get to the...
4647000	4650000	They keep pausing it, so I'm assuming they're looking up the fatality or whatever.
4650000	4651000	Or whatever is followed in this game.
4651000	4653000	Overkill.
4653000	4657000	What was the game that had the ones that were called Cinekills?
4657000	4659000	Do you remember that one?
4659000	4661000	There was a game that called it that and I don't remember what it is.
4661000	4662000	Was it Time Killers?
4662000	4664000	Maybe it was Time Killer. Hold on, I'll find out.
4664000	4667000	Time Killer was the one where you chopped off the body parts. It was funny.
4667000	4672000	Alright, there it is. Your classic Game of the Week Eternal Champions for the Mega Drive.
4672000	4677000	They were Cinekills in Eternal Champion CD is what they were.
4677000	4679000	That's what it was.
4679000	4681000	I knew it was one of them.
4681000	4685000	Alright, we are going to take a quick break and then we'll be back with more Orange Laundry tonight.
4685000	4688000	We have a not-so-serious Fugu Question of the Week tonight that should be fun.
4688000	4691000	A little more news out of PAX East. Hopefully some calls, we're hoping.
4691000	4695000	And, yes, Jamie's going to talk a little more about Mass Effect.
4695000	4697000	But don't worry guys, not too much.
4697000	4698000	Hey!
4698000	4702000	All that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4708000	4711000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4711000	4715000	Live on this Sunday evening, March the 24th, 2013.
4715000	4720000	Episode number 498 of our program in progress.
4720000	4722000	Hello to those of you guys.
4722000	4727000	Apparently we've got a few folks, I've been messaging IRC and just got some text messages,
4727000	4730000	that are listening to us in the car on the way back from PAX East.
4730000	4732000	So, hello you lucky shits.
4732000	4734000	Drive safely.
4734000	4738000	No, drive recklessly. Faster, faster. I'm kidding. Please drive safe.
4738000	4740000	Don't be driving drunk either.
4740000	4742000	Dark Sakura will kick your ass.
4742000	4746000	Alright, let's get back into some rapid fire news.
4746000	4749000	Rob, there are things that are more painful to kick than the ass.
4750000	4753000	Dark Sakura will kick you in the taint, or the ah-bra.
4753000	4755000	She will snap your ah-bra.
4755000	4757000	I will cut a bitch.
4757000	4758000	Alright.
4758000	4760000	And she'll say, you mad bra?
4764000	4766000	Rapid fire news time, Loki.
4766000	4771000	And there's things locally I wish I could buy.
4771000	4776000	Borderlands 2, they're teasing a while back, South by Southwest,
4776000	4779000	that there is going to be a brand new character class.
4779000	4782000	Well, PAX East, they finally revealed what that's going to be.
4782000	4790000	It is Krieg the Psycho, or Krieg the, I guess, I don't know what you call it,
4790000	4792000	the Reformed Psycho.
4792000	4794000	He's basically a psycho from the game.
4794000	4801000	His primary form of attack is melee, which sounds lame actually when you think about it,
4801000	4803000	because this is a game about guns,
4803000	4807000	and also because the character I've been actually playing as Zero has a melee attack,
4807000	4810000	and I fucking hate using it, because I thought it cool.
4810000	4814000	I'm like, hey, cool, I have a samurai sword, I'm going to chop through people.
4814000	4816000	No, I just shoot them in the head and kill them.
4818000	4823000	And of course also there's going to be an Ultimate Vault Hunter upgrade pack on April 2nd.
4823000	4827000	It's going to raise the game's level cap from 50 to 61.
4829000	4831000	Not 60, but 61.
4832000	4834000	That's so much bigger.
4834000	4843000	And I guess the upgrade pack will be part of the season pass, so that's cool.
4843000	4848000	The psycho pack will not be part of the season pass content.
4848000	4855000	And also I guess the upgrade pack is going to have the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode,
4856000	4861000	which of course will raise the level caps of all the enemies in the third playthrough.
4863000	4866000	And of course the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, that's going to be,
4866000	4869000	if you don't have the season pass, five bucks for 400 Microsoft points.
4869000	4874000	Also the psycho pack is 999 or 800 Microsoft points.
4874000	4877000	That's coming in May at some point.
4878000	4883000	And last piece of DLC I guess is coming out in June, and that's going to be part of the campaign.
4886000	4887000	Let's see here.
4887000	4890000	Now I'm laughing because I just got a text from Bobby Blackwolf saying,
4890000	4892000	I'm driving recklessly.
4893000	4895000	Yell at Bobby Thar, Sakura. Yell at him.
4895000	4896000	Ehh!
4897000	4899000	Fi! Fi!
4899000	4900000	That's my new word by the way.
4900000	4904000	No, we haven't done anything worthy of cancellation tonight.
4905000	4906000	Yet.
4906000	4907000	In this half of the show.
4907000	4909000	Alright. Sorry, Loki.
4909000	4911000	Dust and Lesion Tales coming to Steam.
4912000	4916000	And nowhere to win, but it is coming.
4916000	4922000	They're going to be, I guess, not going to be doing a whole lot different than the other versions.
4923000	4925000	But at least it'll look nice if I didn't see them.
4925000	4928000	And then the thing I want to know, is anyone going to fucking buy this game?
4928000	4931000	Because I kind of want to buy this game, but I want people to play with it.
4931000	4934000	No one answered me on Twitter, so fuck them.
4934000	4937000	I'm sure that they had more important things to do.
4937000	4940000	Wait, I think that was actually before PAX, so fuck you guys for not responding back in the first place.
4940000	4943000	And I bet if you ask on Tumblr, you'll just get a bunch of likes and no answers.
4944000	4951000	Yeah. So, but yes. Duke Nukem 3D has come out on Steam as part of this Megaton edition.
4951000	4962000	It's basically Duke Nukem kind of remastered with all the, basically, you know, I knew that they had expansion packs, but I never knew anything was actually kind of official.
4962000	4966000	I thought it was just kind of this third, like a company making like a skin or something and selling it.
4966000	4967000	Yeah, I always thought it was a bunch of homegrown shit.
4967000	4969000	But apparently it was official stuff.
4969000	4977000	Wait, but I have the actual Duke Nukem 3D Mega Edition CD-ROM. I can't just use that. I have to get the Steam version so I can play through Steam, right?
4977000	4978000	I think so, yeah.
4978000	4980000	Bitches. How much is it?
4980000	4981000	Ten dollars.
4981000	4983000	You know, I may have to do this. I'm tempted.
4983000	4987000	It's Duke Nukem 3D, the Atomic Edition, so you got your four campaigns right there.
4987000	4996000	Plus the three bundled expansions, Duke's Caribbean, Life is a Beach, Duke, Nuclear Winter, and Duke it Out in DC.
4996000	5003000	And I guess, you know, the PC and Mac, and they're the OpenGL versions of the game.
5003000	5006000	Duke Nukem's in our chat right now. Well, hail to the king, baby!
5006000	5011000	Saying, I used to have the Kiloton collection. That was official, I believe. That's the one we have.
5011000	5014000	Actually, Alan has it, and I just stole it.
5014000	5020000	Well, I got to Duke Nukem 3D when they were doing that thing with, was it, Good Ol' Games a while back, so I got that.
5020000	5026000	But they're going to add online multiplayer later on, I guess, via Steamworks and Linux support.
5026000	5027000	What? It doesn't have it right now?
5027000	5028000	No.
5028000	5029000	Then why would I buy it?
5029000	5030000	Instant gratification.
5030000	5037000	I don't care about that. I want, here's what I want, as part of, you know, Steamworks, I want custom app supports.
5037000	5041000	Because, man, I used to make Duke Nukem apps all day long, man.
5041000	5046000	That was, I had one, I love this story.
5046000	5053000	I had one where it was basically a water park, or water slide. It was just the moving water, and you would kind of go along with it and move really fast.
5053000	5057000	And there was a drop, because you take no fall damage, you fall in water.
5057000	5062000	So, the drop was done with holding page down, it would lower the floor.
5062000	5067000	I put a paperweight on page down and went and had lunch, and it came back later on.
5067000	5070000	That drop was five minutes long!
5070000	5072000	It was great!
5073000	5076000	But then how do you get back up to the top?
5076000	5083000	Super fast elevator. And if you hit the super fast elevator the wrong way, it will cause you to explode. But, it was awesome.
5083000	5088000	I'm only interested in this when it gets online multiplayer. I can't believe you set this whole thing up and you can't play it.
5088000	5089000	Like, why would I buy it right now?
5089000	5091000	I forgot, okay? Because I haven't bought it yet.
5091000	5093000	But you should buy it here. This is Duke Nukem.
5093000	5094000	I'll buy it when it's online multiplayer.
5094000	5097000	Yeah, exactly. Maybe we should wait until Steam Sale comes.
5097000	5101000	Yeah, I was going to say, and it'll be, the summer Steam Sale gets here, it'll be like $350.
5102000	5104000	Excited.
5104000	5108000	Well, I mean, in the meantime, Gary's Mod, $3.
5108000	5111000	They should just give it to anybody who bought Duke Nukem Forever.
5111000	5113000	Right? Like an apology?
5113000	5114000	We're sorry, here.
5114000	5115000	Like the SimCity thing.
5115000	5116000	Or like boob wall mode.
5116000	5119000	Alright, meanwhile, here's what I'll be playing on Steam.
5119000	5124000	Civilization V, a great Steam game. Another expansion coming out.
5124000	5128000	I was not expecting this, but Civ V Brave New World is the next expansion.
5128000	5130000	It will be launching in July.
5130000	5133000	I didn't catch everything that's supposed to be in this game,
5133000	5137000	but apparently one of the things they're adding are units from XCOM squads,
5137000	5140000	which is a little silly, but okay, it can work.
5140000	5144000	There are going to be paratroopers who drop in 40 units away,
5144000	5146000	as opposed to 9 units away.
5146000	5149000	So, alright, I can kind of see why they're doing that.
5149000	5153000	But I kind of missed what else was supposed to be big about this expansion.
5153000	5157000	Damn, there's not even the video of the XCOM units there anymore.
5157000	5162000	But, alright, if it's a Civ V expansion, I'm going to get it anyway.
5162000	5166000	I will buy that just as fast as Dark Tetsuya will be buying this next game.
5166000	5170000	It's La Mulana, which has a launch date now for Steam.
5170000	5172000	It's April 15th, just in time.
5172000	5175000	File your taxes, and then play an even greater enemy in La Mulana.
5175000	5177000	Or someone can get it for me for my birthday.
5177000	5180000	Perhaps, but your birthday isn't yet.
5180000	5181000	Not on April 15th.
5181000	5183000	It isn't yet, but it's that week.
5183000	5186000	But your birthday is a two-week celebration, correct?
5186000	5189000	My birthday is a fucking month celebration. What are you talking about?
5189000	5191000	It's a holiday in my universe.
5191000	5195000	So, anyhow, La Mulana is going to be on Steam on April 15th.
5195000	5198000	It's the remake of La Mulana, they say.
5198000	5203000	Anyhow, it'll be $15, but if you pre-order, you get a whole 10% off.
5203000	5205000	That's $13.50, y'all.
5205000	5211000	This is the version that's based on the WiiWare game, which took forever to come out.
5211000	5214000	But the Steam version will have the WiiWare DLC, Hell Temple.
5214000	5217000	Because, you know, the game wasn't hard enough.
5217000	5223000	You can plug in a USB controller, like your Xbox 360 controller, and the controller away.
5223000	5228000	Interesting comment this week from some of the folks behind Super Meat Boy.
5228000	5235000	Tommy Refens, talking about DRM in the wake of all the SimCity hubble blue going on.
5235000	5240000	Saying that basically DRM is how developers shoot themselves in the foot.
5241000	5247000	Companies try to combat piracy of their software with DRM, but if loss due to pirated software is not calculable to an accurate amount,
5247000	5250000	does the implementation of DRM provide a return on investment?
5250000	5253000	It is impossible to say yes to this statement.
5253000	5259000	The reality of our current software age is the internet is more efficient at breaking things than companies are at creating them.
5259000	5264000	A company will spend massive amounts of money on DRM and the internet will break it in a matter of days in most cases.
5264000	5268000	When the DRM is broken, is it worth the money spent to implement it?
5268000	5275000	Did the week of unbroken DRM for your game gain you any sales from potential pirates due to the inability to pirate at launch?
5275000	5280000	Again, there's no way of telling, and as such, cannot be used as an accurate justification for spending money.
5281000	5283000	Now, hold on though.
5283000	5291000	As much as you want to go, yeah, DRM sucks, and I do think overdoing DRM is pretty bad.
5291000	5297000	The Steam DRM doesn't annoy me, but some of these DRMs that we've heard about in the past where you get knocked offline and so forth,
5297000	5303000	that stuff annoys me. And the SimCity stuff, for me, that was really never an issue with the DRM.
5303000	5309000	I didn't really care. Just the fact that you had to play SimCity through Origin, I knew it was going to be bad.
5311000	5315000	But some folks are playing it and enjoying it, so you know what, more power to you.
5315000	5317000	I'm having fun with my games, you have fun with yours.
5317000	5319000	But here's the thing about this whole comment.
5319000	5324000	Did the week of unbroken DRM for your game gain you any sales from potential pirates?
5324000	5331000	See, I would argue maybe, because the most critical time for new game sales is that first week.
5331000	5338000	So yeah, if a copy protection or whatever scheme can hold things off for a week, then yeah, actually it might be worth it.
5338000	5340000	But at what price?
5340000	5348000	And that's the problem I have, is that when that DRM starts to step on the toes of the legitimate player, that's when I have a problem with it.
5348000	5355000	And when you have a game like SimCity where the DRM is really bad, as far as the launch week was all messed up,
5355000	5360000	you may have people that are just like, you know what, I'm just not going to pirate that game.
5360000	5362000	Because I don't want to play it.
5362000	5370000	And also, the next game that someone put out, they just may not care anymore.
5370000	5373000	They say, I had such a bad experience with this, I'm not going to buy this game.
5374000	5382000	I'm kind of done dumping on SimCity. There's just a million other games right now that are worthy of my time that I'll play instead.
5382000	5388000	Like The Walking Dead. The intro video. I kid you not, and you can even see this in the reviews.
5388000	5394000	Yeah, I saw the video. That was bad. The mouse is still there.
5394000	5395000	The mouse pointer.
5395000	5396000	That's bad.
5396000	5406000	Really? Really? Come on. That just says, I'm bragging about how little effort I put into this game. That's what that says.
5406000	5412000	And it's so sad that there's like, there's bad walking dead and there's good walking dead.
5412000	5417000	And the bad walking dead, people bought a lot, I'm sure a lot of people bought a lot of because,
5417000	5421000	or stores brought in copies of because the last one did really well.
5421000	5427000	Not knowing that the two have nothing in common except that they're based loosely on the same thing,
5427000	5431000	even though the good ones from the comics and the bad ones from the TV show, right?
5431000	5432000	Yeah.
5432000	5433000	That's unfortunate.
5433000	5441000	ActDeft in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says, everyone should play The Walking Dead. The telltale game, of course.
5441000	5450000	Dungeon Buster speaking about SimCity in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says, it has other issues outside of the always online thing.
5450000	5459000	Let's watch the broken traffic go in circles. I find the whole limited space, extremely limited space for the city kind of interesting.
5459000	5462000	Now, granted, the old SimCity games had that too.
5462000	5469000	But the fact that people have broken it so that you can go outside those lines is really curious to me.
5469000	5477000	But again, I had no interest in SimCity before. I really don't now. Let's move on.
5477000	5481000	I like a nap instead of SimCity. That sounds better.
5481000	5483000	No nap. Stories.
5483000	5485000	Eh. Rap.
5485000	5488000	This is supposedly rapid fire news that's been going on for 20 minutes now.
5488000	5489000	I know, right?
5489000	5494000	Speaking of The Walking Dead, by the way, it's supposed to be coming out on Vita, the telltale version, that is, as in the good one.
5494000	5501000	So you can play it on the Vita. They don't know when, or if it's even going to be episodic or if it's going to be all at once.
5501000	5504000	But it'll be there, so they say.
5505000	5509000	There's also the Indie Springs sale going on Steam right now.
5509000	5513000	Which, Rob, like I told you earlier, you need to get to the moon.
5513000	5517000	Everybody who is listening to my voice, get to the moon.
5517000	5522000	I even was considering getting Dark Souls Prepare to Die, because it was half off too.
5522000	5529000	I also picked up DLC Quest. I forgot to mention. I didn't play it, but I picked it up. It was like three packs.
5529000	5530000	I need to get that.
5530000	5531000	Incredibly short.
5531000	5533000	About an hour worth of your time.
5534000	5535000	For three bucks.
5535000	5536000	Three bucks, that's not a waste.
5536000	5540000	There's a lot worse things I could spend for an hour of my time.
5540000	5550000	There's also Runner 2, Future Legend of the Rhythm Alien, Super Hexagon, Proteus, Retro City Rampage, and VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
5550000	5551000	I'm just gonna call it VVVVVVVVVVVVV
5551000	5556000	Which is a flipping great game, but everybody should've got it in that bundle.
5556000	5557000	Ah ha!
5557000	5561000	A flipping great game.
5561000	5564000	Home in Jamestown, and Kentucky Route Zero.
5564000	5568000	To the Moon, though, I am in love with that game.
5568000	5569000	I'm playing it very slowly on purpose.
5569000	5571000	To the Moon, Jamie! To the Moon!
5571000	5575000	I'm basically playing a level a week so that I can sort of draw out the game.
5575000	5578000	Because it's really, I really think it's adorable.
5578000	5580000	As I mentioned, Gary's mod for three bucks.
5580000	5591000	And Diablo 3 is supposed to be on consoles, but not necessarily exclusive to the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4.
5591000	5597000	It has been confirmed for both, but they're not saying that that's the only place it's gonna be.
5597000	5599000	Can you imagine if they brought it to the Vita?
5599000	5600000	That'd be pretty sweet.
5600000	5601000	That'd be cool.
5601000	5604000	Leaving the door open, though, for the Xbox 360 and the Wii U.
5604000	5605000	I could see the Wii U.
5605000	5607000	I want unicorns and ponies edition.
5607000	5609000	There's nothing but that map.
5609000	5611000	You need to go to Whimsieville or whatever it's called.
5611000	5613000	Yeah, they need to have the Whimsieville edition.
5613000	5615000	There's nothing but Whimsieville quests.
5615000	5616000	Whimsieville's kinda hard, actually, but...
5616000	5618000	Isn't it Whimsie Shire or something?
5618000	5620000	Who cares?
5620000	5622000	Ponies and unicorns.
5622000	5625000	And fairies and rainbows and barf.
5625000	5628000	Specific, specific, specifics.
5628000	5633000	CatastrophicMoggie in our chat room wants to know, are you excited for the To the Moon sequel?
5633000	5634000	Yes!
5634000	5635000	Called To the Venus.
5635000	5636000	No, I just made that up.
5636000	5637000	To the Butt.
5637000	5641000	No, I will be excited when I finish To the Moon.
5641000	5647000	Alright, that does it for rapid fire news tonight, so let's go to our FUGL question of the week.
5648000	5650000	It's very awkward.
5655000	5657000	We ask a question on Facebook and a question on Google.
5657000	5659000	We collect your responses.
5659000	5662000	You slam Facebook and Google together, you get Google.
5662000	5665000	And this week, you guys, not a serious question.
5665000	5667000	We decided to have a little fun with it this week.
5667000	5671000	In the spirit of PAX East and our upcoming 500th episode,
5671000	5677000	a lot of you have joked in the past that you'd like to see a VOGCON or some type of IRL event.
5677000	5681000	What would a VOGCON or your dream convention consist of?
5681000	5683000	So we're talking about people's dream conventions.
5683000	5686000	GamerGirl on Facebook starting us off saying,
5686000	5693000	I think it would consist of DDR event in house, whoever's it would be at, pizza, Mass Effect, and Pinkberry.
5693000	5696000	That's just a Friday night at Jamie's. What are you talking about?
5696000	5699000	Actually, that literally is a Friday night at my house.
5699000	5702000	Because that's exactly what I was doing.
5702000	5705000	VOGCON is suddenly she comes to slumber party at Jamie's.
5705000	5707000	That would be fun.
5707000	5712000	Haseo Tsumuragawa says, VOGCON should have Loki in the Tingle costume. Just saying.
5712000	5716000	Just get over it. I mean, seriously.
5716000	5722000	If you really want it to happen, Eye of Judgment would have worked. It just didn't, okay?
5722000	5726000	You know what, you should actually, you just should wear your Sackboy outfit.
5726000	5730000	I should have made that same bet with, you know, the frickin' wonder books.
5730000	5733000	That thing flopped almost faster than.
5733000	5735000	You should have made the same bet with the Wii U.
5735000	5737000	Oh, alright. Moving on.
5737000	5739000	That did still mill and copy, so.
5739000	5742000	Well then yes, you should have made the same bet with the Wii U.
5742000	5743000	In January, no.
5743000	5748000	Alright, AZHP responds and says, as someone who goes to conventions.
5748000	5750000	Don't we all go to conventions at some point?
5750000	5754000	Alright, as someone who goes to conventions, I don't really care what actually happens at the event.
5754000	5756000	As long as there are cool people to hang out with.
5756000	5763000	Which basically means that a VOGCON would automatically be the second best convention ever behind Fanime.
5763000	5765000	Let's be honest, guys. Fair enough.
5765000	5766000	I like Fanime.
5766000	5772000	James S. replies and says, alls I know is if Dan and Dark Sakura are in the same building,
5772000	5775000	they're not allowed to fight or bicker at one another at all.
5777000	5779000	Just kidding. Love you guys.
5782000	5783000	I lolled.
5783000	5788000	Dark Tetsuya said, I think each show on the network should be represented with a different event.
5788000	5794000	Like for us, I'm assuming meaning OLR, it would have to be either a classic game or a music game competition.
5794000	5797000	Celebrating both our roots and video game's roots in general.
5797000	5801000	I think we'd have to do the music game and let Bobby have the classic game.
5801000	5804000	Because he, you know, I can't remember his tag on off the top of my head.
5804000	5806000	But you know, he talks about gaming's history and all that.
5807000	5815000	Fabrice A. replies and says, Dan should host a DDR tournament called Dan's Central.
5819000	5822000	He would, you know what Dan's reply to that would be?
5822000	5824000	Dan's Central.
5824000	5826000	He'd make his gorilla face and go, really?
5826000	5831000	That got a like from Tiara, essentially. She replied and said seconded, essentially.
5831000	5832000	She would.
5832000	5837000	Alright. Osefer has an answer. Oh boy.
5837000	5842000	A vogcon would consist of different gingerbread treats and fuzzy red teddy bears named Rob.
5844000	5846000	Your sexy gingerbread legs.
5846000	5852000	The rave would only play disco disco and main dinner entrees would always be garnished with oranges.
5852000	5854000	Mmm, vog themed alcoholic drinks.
5854000	5857000	A gingerbread legs martini sounds nice.
5857000	5860000	Some cinnamon rum and butterscotch schnapps.
5860000	5862000	You got problems.
5862000	5864000	Eww, that sounds nasty.
5864000	5866000	That's so nasty.
5866000	5868000	Let's go to Code Man with hopefully a...
5868000	5870000	I like Code Man.
5870000	5872000	Less scary answer.
5872000	5879000	Hanging with the people that I listen to so much and finally, in other words, putting faces to the people that I love listening to.
5879000	5882000	Oh, and of course, DDR, Pinkberry, because I've never had it.
5882000	5884000	Loki in a tingle costume.
5884000	5889000	And most of all, and I repeat this, everyone that makes VOG a network meshing together and having a great time.
5889000	5891000	Because in the end, that's what matters most.
5891000	5896000	And then you follow that up with, oh, and Taco Cabana for Shane, which Shane liked.
5896000	5898000	See, I like Code Man.
5898000	5900000	Who doesn't like tacos?
5900000	5902000	I'm gonna give a like for tacos as well.
5902000	5904000	I like Code Man. Code Man's cool.
5904000	5906000	Yeah, he's cool.
5906000	5909000	We've been supposedly playing Mass Effect 3 online for like two weeks.
5909000	5913000	You know what? My next lol effect picture is going to involve tacos.
5913000	5915000	Amazing.
5915000	5917000	Everything should involve tacos.
5917000	5919000	In this case, it'll be indigestion.
5919000	5929000	Daniel N. replies and says, if I can see the OLR cast and Bobby get back on a DDR pad, and Bobby is in caps,
5929000	5937000	get back on a DDR pad on Heavy as they are now and a tattoo artist on hand to do Mass Effect art, that would be a good VOG con.
5937000	5943000	I believe, and I'm sure I'll get a text message in a few minutes here if I'm incorrect,
5943000	5946000	I don't believe Bobby was ever a DDR player.
5946000	5948000	He was way more into Beatmania and all that.
5948000	5950000	You know what's actually funny?
5950000	5955000	Well, since I've been getting on my big fitness kick, we're actually gonna be hooking back up the DDR in my house.
5955000	5961000	I would play DDR. I would bring back my alter ego, Dr. Dick, one last time at VOG con.
5961000	5963000	I liked Mr. Spanky.
5963000	5965000	But you wouldn't cosplay him.
5965000	5967000	Remember when I did the DDR tour?
5967000	5968000	Do you still have the hat?
5968000	5972000	I'm too fat to cosplay Mr. Spanky, and if you think these comments from Ossifer are creepy now...
5972000	5974000	Rob, Mr. Spanky was bigger than you.
5975000	5978000	Okay? I saw Mr. Spanky and that was disgusting.
5978000	5979000	That is true.
5979000	5980000	By the way, do you still have the hat?
5980000	5982000	That orange fuzzy hat?
5982000	5983000	I might, actually.
5983000	5986000	You know what I found when I was looking for my art supplies the other day?
5986000	5987000	The orange bat.
5987000	5990000	I still have that. I know I have that.
5990000	5991000	I have my orange bat.
5991000	5993000	I think mine might still have the signatures on it.
5993000	5994000	Mine does.
5994000	5995000	Nice.
5995000	5997000	Some comments from Google+. We can't forget Google+.
5997000	5999000	Flaco Jones saying,
5999000	6005000	How about a trophy presentation to the winningest VOG the game participant of all time?
6005000	6010000	Seriously though, any kind of hangout with each show getting a chance to take the stage would be cool.
6010000	6012000	And in Vegas, of course.
6012000	6014000	Nobody else suggesting the location.
6014000	6017000	I mean, we're in Sacramento, but there's lots of people on VOG.
6017000	6020000	So, we'd have to hold it in some type of central location.
6020000	6022000	So, anyhow.
6022000	6024000	Going next to actdeft.
6024000	6030000	For me, a VOGCon would just simply consist of hanging with all my fellow VOG staffers in the VOG community.
6030000	6033000	Playing games, talking or discussing.
6033000	6035000	Maybe doing a special show for all the listeners.
6035000	6038000	And doing what friends do. Enjoying the moment with each other.
6038000	6040000	Aww.
6040000	6043000	Excuse me, hairball.
6043000	6046000	And lastly, Rettertainment.
6046000	6048000	Loki in a tingle costume.
6048000	6050000	That is like three people that said that.
6050000	6052000	It's not gonna happen.
6053000	6055000	You got the closest thing.
6055000	6057000	The Sackboy was pretty epic.
6057000	6060000	An artistic reenactment of what that would look like.
6060000	6062000	And that was it.
6062000	6064000	Alright, awesome.
6064000	6066000	I actually read all the answers tonight.
6066000	6070000	But join us on Facebook or Google Plus for future questions.
6070000	6072000	We'll do some more serious ones next time.
6072000	6074000	But I thought that would be a fun question to ask.
6074000	6075000	What's your dream convention?
6075000	6076000	I will say this.
6076000	6078000	VOG may not be having a convention this year.
6078000	6081000	But we're gonna be heavily represented at DragonCon this year.
6081000	6085000	So I would say if you're in that southeast part of the country.
6085000	6087000	Or even if you're not.
6087000	6089000	Because I'm not. Really try to plan on that.
6089000	6091000	Because I'll be there representing OLR.
6091000	6093000	Travis will be there representing Under Sedation Live.
6093000	6097000	I'm pretty sure Pod Culture usually goes.
6097000	6099000	I'm sure they're still figuring it out.
6099000	6101000	Critical Myth I'm positive will be there.
6101000	6103000	Bobby will be there. British Invaders went last year.
6103000	6104000	So they'll probably go this year.
6104000	6106000	The only show that probably won't be there.
6106000	6108000	I even think Rama is talking about going.
6108000	6109000	I could be wrong.
6109000	6110000	But he went to Atlanta for something else.
6110000	6112000	So he can go to DragonCon.
6112000	6116000	The only one that I wouldn't know would be Girls Gone Wow.
6116000	6118000	And if we can make that happen.
6118000	6122000	Then Lordy we will fly one of their asses in from the UK if we could.
6122000	6124000	So that would be fun.
6124000	6126000	Wouldn't you want to party with Sil?
6126000	6130000	I would love for people to send me a ticket so I can go to DragonCon.
6130000	6132000	You can get on a bus.
6132000	6136000	Dark Sakura across America.
6136000	6138000	Alright.
6138000	6140000	There you go.
6140000	6141000	Our foogle question of the week.
6141000	6143000	Let's get back into some more news about video games.
6143000	6144000	Loki.
6144000	6145000	Alright.
6145000	6147000	So let's see.
6147000	6148000	Double Fine.
6148000	6153000	You remember they had that wonderful Kickstarter that kind of brought Kickstarter to the forefront?
6153000	6156000	Well Double Fine Adventures now has a name.
6156000	6158000	It is called Broken Age.
6158000	6160000	And I guess it was revealed at PAX East.
6160000	6164000	They even have a website now for it at brokenagegame.com.
6164000	6166000	And basically here's what it is.
6166000	6172000	Broken Age is a point and click adventure game telling the stories of a young boy and girl leading parallel lives.
6172000	6178000	The girl has been chosen by her village to be sacrificed to a terrible monster but she decides to fight back.
6178000	6186000	Meanwhile a boy on a spaceship is living a solitary life under the care of a motherly computer.
6186000	6190000	But wants to break free and lead an adventure and do good in the world.
6190000	6192000	Adventure ensues.
6193000	6195000	Adventure ensues.
6195000	6196000	That's the most important part.
6196000	6197000	Yes.
6197000	6198000	Hijinks occur.
6198000	6204000	If you didn't back the Kickstarter you can preorder the game via the website.
6204000	6206000	And yeah.
6206000	6208000	So it looks neat.
6208000	6210000	I don't really know.
6210000	6212000	I'll have to see when the game comes out.
6212000	6216000	Well a lot of people already bought it.
6216000	6217000	Yeah.
6217000	6225000	It's going to be one of the first games to come out that just besides maybe what Diablo 3 where they just give a million of them away because people already bought them.
6225000	6226000	Yeah.
6226000	6227000	So.
6227000	6228000	Alright.
6228000	6229000	Anyhow.
6229000	6232000	Some updates from Xbox games on demand.
6232000	6236000	Some reasons why day and date launches don't always make it to games on demand.
6236000	6246000	You know there's a big push to try and get games delivered digitally at the exact same time they show up in stores because you know the convenience of downloading them and needing to have that game right now.
6246000	6248000	Really goes a long way in selling them.
6248000	6252000	I know a lot of people bought Luigi's Mansion digitally because it came out right at midnight.
6252000	6256000	And a lot of people were like I can't even wait the six hours to get to the store.
6256000	6258000	Or I guess more than six.
6258000	6259000	But you know what I mean.
6259000	6260000	Anyhow.
6260000	6264000	Eric Yeager the senior business manager of Xbox games on demand.
6264000	6269000	This is why titles don't launch day and date alongside retail releases.
6269000	6270000	Quote.
6270000	6272000	We have a lot of strong partnerships with retailers.
6272000	6274000	We really need them to do a lot for us.
6274000	6276000	They're the ones out there selling the consoles.
6276000	6277000	Selling the peripherals.
6277000	6282000	And in this time we're trying to figure out how to fit that into the whole digital landscape shift.
6282000	6285000	We're just taking a bit of measured pace with it.
6285000	6286000	So very interesting.
6286000	6289000	Sort of kind of the converse of what you're seeing with Nintendo.
6289000	6294000	That they're actually purposely giving a little breathing room to the retailers.
6294000	6299000	Which is ironic considering those rumors that gained yet again more steam this week.
6299000	6304000	We didn't put it on the show roll tonight because it's the same fucking rumor we've heard for a couple months.
6304000	6310000	But more stuff out there apparently indicating that Xbox the new one will always be online.
6310000	6312000	I don't think it's actually going to be online only.
6312000	6313000	What do you think?
6313000	6316000	I think that people are misinterpreting what it is.
6316000	6317000	You think it's more of a.
6317000	6318000	I was on that.
6318000	6321000	I was on that boat too until I read closer and thought about a little bit.
6321000	6323000	I think the wording just a little weird.
6323000	6326000	But what they basically said makes sense.
6326000	6327000	And I think it's going to be.
6327000	6328000	First off there's a few reasons.
6328000	6329000	One.
6329000	6331000	It's incredibly risky to do that.
6331000	6333000	Because if they're the only company doing that.
6333000	6336000	Remember they have shareholders to answer to.
6336000	6340000	And they can't necessarily just go do this thing where.
6340000	6343000	Hey we're going to go ahead and cut out all of the retail marketplace.
6343000	6344000	Hahaha.
6344000	6347000	You know we're going to sell games digitally only.
6347000	6350000	Or you know we're going to basically prevent you from buying.
6350000	6352000	You know selling your game used and that kind of thing.
6352000	6355000	Here's what they basically said.
6355000	6360000	This is coming from some screenshots of the software development kit.
6360000	6363000	On vgleaks.com.
6363000	6365000	And basically they said.
6365000	6368000	Where I'm trying to find this exact.
6368000	6371000	Durango will implement different power states.
6371000	6373000	So it can be powered on.
6373000	6375000	We'll draw minimal electricity blah blah blah.
6375000	6377000	Kind of like the Playstation 4.
6377000	6380000	It says with this always on always connected design.
6380000	6382000	And now but see that's where everyone's like.
6382000	6383000	Oh always on always connected.
6383000	6386000	They said the console will be ready instantly when users want to play.
6386000	6392000	And will maintain a network connection so that the console software and games are always current.
6392000	6395000	I think the always on always connected means that it's going to have a standby.
6395000	6398000	And it's going to download those updates for your game.
6398000	6401000	And system updates when it's in standby.
6401000	6403000	So you don't have to fucking wait for an update to happen.
6403000	6405000	That makes more sense.
6405000	6410000	So I mean this was the same marketing spiel behind we connect 24.
6410000	6412000	Even though obviously that didn't do the system updates and stuff.
6412000	6416000	I mean the way that reads is an awful lot like they pitched we connect 24.
6416000	6421000	But see all these blogging sites and some of these guys that are trying to get near these headlines.
6421000	6424000	And trust me I bought into it too until I finally read it.
6424000	6427000	Always on always connected like oh there you go.
6427000	6429000	It's got to always be connected to the internet.
6429000	6433000	No I think if you want to use this feature where your console updates itself.
6433000	6437000	In standby so you don't have to wait for these updates and doesn't have to reset and stuff.
6437000	6439000	That's what they mean by this.
6439000	6444000	It's a feature so that because no one fucking likes waiting for these updates to happen.
6444000	6447000	You're trying to play a game and oh I got to wait five minutes for this shit to download.
6447000	6450000	That's what they're trying to prevent.
6450000	6454000	And so I think that no use games will be a thing.
6454000	6456000	I think that this is what they're trying to do.
6456000	6460000	And I think that everyone's going to be like very mistaken when they come out and announce this shit.
6460000	6464000	Well thank God it'll all be settled in less than a month hopefully at this point.
6464000	6467000	Because the announcement is supposed to be in April right?
6467000	6468000	The end of April.
6468000	6470000	Please let this be over with soon.
6470000	6472000	Dark Soccer in the meantime.
6472000	6474000	Well I have Mass Effect news.
6474000	6476000	As we warned you.
6476000	6478000	But this is actually really sad.
6478000	6485000	They're basically going into how seamless it was to get the character of Nirene the Female Turian in the Omega DLC.
6485000	6489000	That it was actually really smooth to get her accepted.
6489000	6492000	Except that that's really an exception to the case.
6492000	6498000	We've had plenty of games go through where a female character has been proposed.
6498000	6504000	And the game is shot down simply because of the gender of the main player, the protagonist.
6504000	6508000	Like Remember Me was shot down for the same reason.
6508000	6511000	And that there's a statement going out that basically.
6511000	6518000	And I really liked this statement here that's by the creative director for Remember Me.
6518000	6525000	Jean Maxime Morris said if you think that there's no way this medium is going to mature.
6525000	6529000	So it's really a lot of misogyny we need to.
6529000	6533000	Those stats they put out for that Mass Effect 3 panel were pretty eye opening though.
6533000	6535000	What was it only 18%?
6535000	6538000	18% of players beat it with Female Shepherd.
6538000	6542000	But that is, if you'll notice, the loudest part of the fandom.
6542000	6544000	Is that 18%.
6544000	6547000	And honestly I chalk that up to bros.
6550000	6554000	Caden is a squadmate less than 2% of the time.
6554000	6555000	I couldn't believe that.
6555000	6557000	That's because he was a whiny bitch.
6557000	6558000	Kidding.
6558000	6560000	So are you but you've been on 100% of these shows.
6560000	6562000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
6562000	6564000	Yeah I've been on more like 95%.
6564000	6565000	Still.
6565000	6570000	But the other thing too is that they almost didn't make Tally playable in Mass Effect 3.
6570000	6573000	Which would have been a shame.
6573000	6576000	Basically enough people were passionate about it that they made her playable.
6576000	6581000	But I guess that might have to be why she wasn't even available until like halfway through the game.
6583000	6585000	And I mean I've been running across people who say,
6585000	6587000	Oh she's so irritating, she's so annoying.
6587000	6589000	I was like, hell she was great.
6589000	6592000	Even though she's not like a very strong squadmate.
6592000	6596000	I remember reading some story and I don't know if there's something you'd put on Tumblr or where.
6596000	6599000	But that a lot of characters weren't playable in Mass Effect 2.
6599000	6602000	Because they didn't want you to get them killed before 3.
6602000	6604000	Well yeah that was it too.
6604000	6610000	They were saying because they were part of I guess something that they had in mind for 3.
6610000	6612000	So that's why they didn't have them playable.
6612000	6616000	But still I think that everybody should have been playable for the last one.
6616000	6618000	There's a lot of stuff that could have gone better about Mass Effect 3.
6618000	6621000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
6621000	6626000	Some of those PAX East panels weren't broadcast. I hope they post them online like the BioWare one.
6626000	6629000	Me too. I'd love to see that actually.
6629000	6630000	Yeah.
6630000	6633000	Alright. Well we'll get to the mailbag shortly.
6633000	6636000	Or no. Do we get any emails this week?
6636000	6640000	No. Just the one that was just more for direction.
6640000	6642000	Are we reading it or no? I guess not.
6642000	6643000	Alright.
6643000	6645000	I checked. There's nothing else so.
6645000	6647000	Well shame on all of you guys for not emailing us.
6647000	6648000	Yeah how dare you.
6648000	6650000	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
6650000	6652000	Well we still have some news stories.
6652000	6655000	Well thank you capstrapootmoggy. I like tally as well.
6655000	6657000	Alright we still have some news stories for you guys.
6657000	6658000	Loki.
6658000	6663000	So this is kind of cool. There's a partnership that was announced by Sony and Unity.
6663000	6671000	Basically the Unity engine will now have ways to port games to the Playstation platform.
6671000	6675000	Including Playstation 4, PS3, Vita and Playstation Mobile.
6675000	6681000	And using these I guess it will be easier to take advantage of different system stuff.
6681000	6684000	Like the cameras and the touchpads and that kind of stuff.
6684000	6685000	Playstation Network.
6685000	6695000	And they say also because of that it will allow people to port titles easier to iOS and Android as well.
6695000	6698000	And I guess there's already some games that have used this.
6698000	6703000	Including Might and Delight's PID and Funbit's Escape Plan.
6704000	6706000	Oh I saw Funbit's Escape Plan.
6706000	6709000	Oh that was built in that game? That's pretty cool.
6709000	6711000	Remember that. That was the launch title.
6711000	6713000	PID and Funbit. Or PID.
6714000	6715000	What's PID?
6716000	6717000	I have no idea. PID is.
6718000	6720000	But yeah. Escape Plan looked kind of cool.
6721000	6722000	So cool.
6722000	6724000	And I know a lot of people use Unity for all sorts of things.
6724000	6727000	So porting games will be easier.
6727000	6731000	And it sounds like that they kind of are embracing kind of indie development a little bit better.
6731000	6740000	I think they're finding out that hey these indie titles that we're bringing over to like the Vita and stuff seem to be doing well for us.
6740000	6743000	Let's get them more involved with other consoles.
6743000	6746000	Making it easier to get your game on there. So I like that.
6751000	6754000	Is this something that will be for PlayStation 3 and 4?
6754000	6759000	Yeah. It's all stuff. 3, 4, Vita and mobile.
6759000	6760000	Well that's pretty cool.
6760000	6765000	Again it's with a new console coming out this year it seems like there's so much still on the PlayStation 3.
6766000	6775000	Yeah it's kind of hard to sell your next console when there's all this stuff coming to your current console.
6775000	6779000	Well you guys remember Street Fighter X Tekken.
6779000	6785000	And it was okay. I don't think it was as good as a lot of people were hoping it would be.
6785000	6787000	On Disney or DLC.
6787000	6790000	That's one of the things it will be remembered for forever.
6790000	6794000	Well remember Street Fighter X Tekken wasn't the only game that was supposed to happen there.
6794000	6797000	There was supposed to be another game, Tekken Cross Street Fighter.
6797000	6800000	Which was Namco's version of the game basically.
6800000	6803000	As more of a Tekken style fighter.
6803000	6805000	No news on that in a while.
6805000	6810000	But producer Katsuhiro Harada responding to a fan on Twitter said quote.
6810000	6813000	We are changing and considering platform strategy.
6813000	6815000	That's why we don't say anything.
6815000	6818000	So a lot of people are speculating that based on that message.
6818000	6822000	Oh they're going to move it up to PlayStation 4 and the new Xbox.
6822000	6825000	As opposed to the current gen which would make a lot of sense.
6825000	6829000	It would also kind of give them a chance to really reinvent some things.
6829000	6835000	And hopefully make people forget about the fact that they didn't care for Street Fighter X Tekken.
6835000	6838000	So you can't really see how this is bad news.
6838000	6841000	Except the fact that it's going to be a little while longer before this game comes out.
6842000	6845000	DarkSakura, I know you're a fighting girl fan.
6845000	6848000	You're a fighting game girl fan.
6848000	6851000	Are you excited about Tekken Cross Street Fighter?
6851000	6854000	I'm reserving judgement.
6854000	6856000	I'm not going to get it right away.
6856000	6857000	Okay.
6857000	6859000	Unless that trailer comes out and you're like oh my god.
6859000	6862000	Oh my god Jen. Oh my god Ryu.
6862000	6863000	So we'll see.
6863000	6865000	I like even this little teaser image. Ryu looks great.
6865000	6868000	I like him kind of the Tekken style.
6868000	6876000	Well I even have to say that I've always been a fan of the Street Fighter characters done in the style of another game.
6876000	6878000	Like remember SNK?
6878000	6881000	I loved their renditions of the Street Fighter characters.
6881000	6888000	Not on the show roll tonight but I want to say I heard that CVS2 is supposed to be coming out for PlayStation Classics or something like that.
6888000	6890000	So you can get it on PS3.
6890000	6893000	That would sort of be a big why for me.
6893000	6894000	Because it's awesome.
6894000	6895000	Because I've already got it.
6895000	6896000	Yeah.
6896000	6900000	I would like to see it re-release. You could do like online battles would be pretty cool but.
6900000	6904000	For matching service. We need more games that say for matching service in the title.
6904000	6905000	We do need.
6905000	6908000	You know I've actually got the Vampire Savior for matching service.
6908000	6911000	That I forgot completely that we actually owned that game.
6911000	6915000	So I might sell it.
6915000	6920000	Did you ever read gamer girl's comment in chat here Loki about PID?
6920000	6925000	PID is a side scroller in which you play a little boy who gets lost and gets put on a planet and has to find his way home.
6925000	6928000	And she gives you a link there to PID.
6928000	6929000	All right.
6929000	6936000	Tigerclaw following up with the Mass Effect information from earlier saying there was some mention about the Mass Effect movie during that panel.
6936000	6939000	But nothing like when it's coming out because I don't think they even started.
6939000	6942000	They've never even. They haven't even started yet.
6942000	6946000	You know I'd probably see it out of morbid fascination but I just wouldn't.
6946000	6956000	For me. I am so deeply entrenched into the game playing as a female shepherd that to think of playing it as a guy is inconceivable to me.
6956000	6959000	I really hope somebody puts their foot down and makes it a fem chef.
6959000	6961000	I can. I really do.
6961000	6966000	I think it would be a great character but I don't know.
6966000	6977000	I also kind of want them to really fuck with the fandom and do something really atrocious in the game like do a decision that like can't even happen in the game.
6977000	6990000	Like have Caden and Ashley survive Vermaier or like something that just totally like makes fan boys and fan girls just like what are you doing.
6990000	6992000	I really want that to happen.
6992000	6996000	I want Dark Soccer to twitch nervously when she's watching Mass Effect.
6996000	6998000	Honestly. I wouldn't care.
6998000	7000000	I want Garrus to die.
7000000	7002000	No! No!
7002000	7004000	Oh my god Rob I can't believe you'd say something so horrible.
7004000	7005000	Okay.
7005000	7009000	I'm done. I'm gonna leave right now to get my soda.
7009000	7014000	Alright. This is the part where we would do the mailbag.
7014000	7016000	Fuck you.
7016000	7018000	But you didn't email us. Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
7018000	7020000	Maybe you should do that for next time.
7020000	7027000	So instead we'll go right into the FUs of the week even though this is really not a good time to be doing that but it is what it is.
7027000	7043000	This is fucked up.
7044000	7055000	I have two FUs really. One of them is to my iPad for not supporting Java so that I can sign up for something that Rob's gonna be talking about later.
7055000	7060000	And then my other one goes to the stupid bitch face.
7060000	7062000	Okay I actually have another one than that.
7062000	7068000	To bitch face number one who was in the car in front of me and one of those homeless guy panhandlers was outside.
7069000	7077000	And she turned on her windshield wipers for the entire period of time that we were at the light and started flinging water at him.
7077000	7080000	And it was clearly on purpose because her car was not dirty.
7080000	7083000	You could see all the way through her windshield and back windshield.
7083000	7085000	She's just doing it to be a bitch.
7085000	7087000	So I gave him 50 cents.
7087000	7089000	Instead I apologize on behalf of humanity.
7089000	7092000	Not really. But I did give him money.
7092000	7097000	And then to my former boss bitch face.
7097000	7101000	I don't care if you fuck with me. Don't fuck with my friends.
7101000	7102000	I'm done.
7102000	7103000	Logie.
7103000	7112000	Um. I guess I have to be the fact that my coworkers gone so I got no one to talk to.
7112000	7116000	Yeah.
7116000	7120000	Fuck my hand for being weak. Thank you Rob.
7120000	7123000	I opened a bottle for Dark Sakura.
7123000	7126000	Cause I'm strong.
7126000	7128000	Cause all the pressure builds up inside.
7128000	7129000	Alright.
7129000	7131000	And fuck the Mass Effect movie.
7131000	7134000	F you to the freaking wild turkeys in this neighborhood.
7134000	7136000	They're all assholes.
7136000	7141000	Like one of them literally flew right in front of my car today with a death wish.
7141000	7142000	Wanting me to hit.
7142000	7144000	So I have to slam on the brakes.
7144000	7147000	Thank god there wasn't a car behind me or I probably would have been in an accident.
7147000	7151000	I probably would have gotten whiplash thanks to the stupid fucking turkey that lives near here.
7151000	7153000	So F you to the turkeys.
7153000	7155000	Why you so stupid turkeys?
7155000	7156000	Tell me.
7156000	7163000	Did you know that actually turkeys were rated as one of the most stupid animals to live?
7163000	7166000	Well thank god we eat so many of them once a year.
7166000	7168000	I wouldn't eat the wild turkeys in this neighborhood.
7168000	7169000	Who knows what the fuck they've been eating.
7169000	7170000	That's true.
7170000	7172000	They probably taste like radiation.
7172000	7173000	Alright.
7173000	7174000	That does it for the FUs of the week.
7174000	7176000	A couple more news stories for you guys.
7176000	7179000	And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7179000	7180000	Or our username on Skype.
7180000	7182000	Orange Lounge Radio.
7182000	7184000	But first a couple stories.
7184000	7194000	So apparently there has been some research into video games and their effects on kids with dyslexia.
7194000	7197000	And actually allowing them to be able to read.
7197000	7199000	And this is kind of cool.
7199000	7203000	They did a study basically where they had 20 kids.
7203000	7208000	20 dyslexic children playing Rayman's Raving Rabbids.
7208000	7211000	Which is crazy as it is.
7212000	7215000	For a total of 12 hours over 9 days.
7215000	7219000	And of course the game has a ton of crazy mini games and that kind of fun stuff.
7219000	7228000	And basically before and after the 9 days of game playing the researchers tested the kids on several different tasks.
7228000	7234000	Including reading speed and accuracy, word recognition, and their ability to pay attention to multiple types of input.
7234000	7236000	Sight and sound at once.
7236000	7243000	Before playing the games the two groups were both equivalent in these tasks.
7243000	7250000	But after 12 hours of the games the kids that played the mini games showed significant improvements in their ability to read.
7250000	7256000	They read faster, more accurately, and they recognized more words than they had before the treatment.
7256000	7262000	Meanwhile the children that had played non-active mini games didn't do any better on the tests.
7262000	7264000	So that's kind of neat.
7266000	7271000	I think that's a great story with all the crap that video games get sometimes.
7271000	7276000	I'm glad to hear something where it's bona fide showing that it's helping in a particular scenario here.
7276000	7279000	You know, helping children with this. It's great.
7279000	7283000	It's almost like all those years spent telling mom it improves my hand-eye coordination.
7283000	7285000	Like now there's the science to back it up.
7285000	7286000	Yes.
7286000	7287000	But the science has always been there.
7287000	7290000	I mean for the sake of reading.
7290000	7293000	And this is something actually we learned in typography.
7293000	7298000	The human brain will read lowercase letters better than it will read anything that's all caps.
7298000	7302000	A good reader reads the shape of the words, not the individual letters.
7302000	7310000	So doing something that's going to improve time cognition for getting instinctive action over slow and methodical picking it out
7310000	7315000	would definitely, I think, improve that skill when it comes to actually reading a shape of a word.
7315000	7319000	You know that's really funny because when I was studying broadcast journalism
7319000	7324000	whenever you look at scripts for TV shows and stuff or the teleprompters, everything's always written in caps.
7324000	7328000	And it's not, you know, everybody makes that joke like, why are you yelling though?
7328000	7331000	But they actually say it's to make you slow down.
7331000	7333000	That's why they write scripts like that.
7333000	7334000	Exactly.
7334000	7336000	Because it's the opposite of what you're saying.
7336000	7338000	I'll say one more thing on the subject.
7338000	7342000	They were doing a study of different types of readers.
7342000	7346000	You know, basically really slow, really low level readers and then higher level readers.
7346000	7351000	And they timed blink rates and pause rates for when people were reading.
7351000	7360000	And the slower readers would blink and pause more often, usually in the middle of a word as opposed to at the end of sections of words.
7360000	7362000	Very cool.
7362000	7365000	All right. One more news story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.
7365000	7370000	And it's about a sequel to an old favorite here at Orange Lounge Radio.
7371000	7375000	Gravity Entertainment recently announced Ragnarok Online 2.
7375000	7378000	Actually, this wasn't years ago they announced this.
7378000	7380000	Yeah, yeah, but I don't care because I'm signing up.
7380000	7384000	Ragnarok Online 2, Legend of the Second.
7384000	7386000	With music done by Yoko Kanno.
7386000	7387000	Really?
7387000	7388000	Yeah.
7388000	7389000	That's awesome.
7389000	7392000	Apparently, this game is now finally almost here.
7392000	7395000	It's supposed to be an open beta in mid-April.
7395000	7397000	Pre-registration is available.
7397000	7399000	You can also check it out on the Facebook page.
7399000	7402000	I want to check out this little trailer here in studio.
7402000	7406000	And if it goes anything like the last Ragnarok Online, it's going to be in beta for seven years.
7406000	7408000	Most likely.
7411000	7414000	Is there any actual gameplay in this video, or is it just a bunch of frickin' cutscenes?
7414000	7417000	No, but there's YouTube video from the alpha.
7417000	7423000	Will I get to fight, what were they called, Prinnies, the little slime people?
7423000	7424000	Pourings.
7424000	7425000	Pourings.
7425000	7428000	Oh, Prinnies are the dudes from Disgaea. What am I thinking?
7428000	7430000	Oh my god, the alphas look so awesome.
7430000	7433000	Okay, how long did I play Ragnarok Online, Rob?
7433000	7435000	I don't know, how long until they banned you!
7435000	7439000	No, no they didn't. I actually played, I was one of, let's put it this way,
7439000	7442000	if I go back and play the International Ragnarok Online right now,
7442000	7446000	I can get all of my characters back and all of my old stuff because I was in the alpha.
7446000	7449000	Because you're a super nerd and you have a badge to prove it.
7449000	7450000	I sure do.
7450000	7454000	Alright, well let us know if you're able to get in the beta for Ragnarok Online 2 and don't get banned.
7454000	7455000	Alright.
7455000	7457000	I've never been banned!
7457000	7459000	You're banned from this show, get out.
7459000	7464000	I used to be friends with some of the GMs, shit.
7464000	7469000	Alright, we are at the end of our news, so we're going to open up the Skype line.
7469000	7473000	And I'm hoping we're going to hear from some people that went to PAX East tonight.
7473000	7475000	So we're going to open up the phones and see what happens.
7475000	7479000	1-877-GAME-OLR is the toll free number you can use to call.
7479000	7482000	Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
7482000	7488000	But remember, if you do call us on Skype, you want to call ECHO123 first, just to test your connection.
7488000	7491000	Oh, phone's already lighting up, we got a call.
7491000	7493000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
7493000	7495000	I'm driving recklessly, guys.
7495000	7497000	Hey, Bobby!
7497000	7500000	I just got in the door.
7500000	7503000	You just literally walked in the door back from PAX East.
7503000	7505000	But is the fence still intact?
7505000	7507000	Yes! It is.
7507000	7509000	Is it offensive?
7509000	7512000	No, did you hear about Bobby's fence drama?
7512000	7513000	No.
7513000	7515000	Oh, about the people cutting through his yard?
7515000	7516000	Yeah.
7516000	7520000	And then the kids that decided once I locked it that they needed to teach me a lesson by tearing it down?
7520000	7522000	Fuck them.
7522000	7527000	Then didn't you get it all fixed and then a little mini tornado took it out anyway or something?
7527000	7532000	They took one of the other signs. The mini tornado took my 99 cent no trespassing sign.
7532000	7534000	So I had to replace that.
7534000	7536000	I'm not reporting that to my insurance, though.
7536000	7538000	You were not having luck this week.
7538000	7541000	But then you got to go to PAX East and hopefully that made it all better, right?
7541000	7543000	Yes, it did.
7543000	7545000	Well, how was it?
7545000	7551000	It was great. I had a great time. I met a lot of people, especially from the community, and I wanted to open up with this.
7551000	7554000	And I told him I was going to say this.
7554000	7558000	Because I've been listening to OLR for a long time. Maybe not all ten years.
7558000	7567000	But I've been listening to OLR and a lot of times during OLR I always roll my eyes because what do I hear near the end of the show?
7567000	7572000	Hi, this is Legend of Zaku. How are you doing, Rob?
7572000	7576000	So I actually got to meet Legend of Zaku.
7576000	7582000	And he's actually an energetic, interesting, fun person to be around.
7582000	7586000	He's nothing like what you hear on Sunday night.
7586000	7589000	He's a great guy, and I hope he's on to hear this.
7589000	7592000	Because people in the past have actually said, like, why do you let that guy on your show?
7592000	7598000	And I'm like, because if you meet him, he's actually kind of cool, so stay pressed.
7598000	7601000	Every gamer has a voice, right?
7601000	7605000	And he's basically saying, yeah, I'm just chill because I have to work the next morning and everything.
7605000	7609000	But Friday night he's bouncing off the walls and everything.
7609000	7610000	Good times.
7610000	7613000	I just wanted to give that little insight to OLR.
7613000	7618000	Yeah, he's like, hi, this is Legend of Zaku.
7618000	7621000	No, he actually does have a personality, and it's a good one.
7621000	7624000	You've got to pound on the keyboard.
7624000	7625000	Alright.
7625000	7628000	So you got to meet a lot of people, right?
7628000	7630000	Like, SSJ100Matt was there, right?
7630000	7632000	I met SSJ100Matt a couple times.
7632000	7634000	I met Jon from Critical Myth.
7634000	7636000	Met up with him.
7636000	7640000	Met up with Ranma and a bunch of people from the cosplay group that he's in.
7640000	7642000	Anime Jam Session.
7642000	7644000	I got to meet Misty.
7644000	7647000	And Hitstun found us.
7647000	7650000	And met some other people from the community.
7650000	7653000	It was a good time. I didn't get to see Havoc978.
7653000	7657000	I didn't go to the Bring Your Own Computer area all that often, so that's kind of where he hangs out.
7657000	7665000	But comparing PAX East to PAX Prime, I can see why they're saying that PAX East is the real PAX.
7665000	7667000	Just because that convention center is huge.
7667000	7670000	I don't know if the one you went to was in this convention center.
7670000	7676000	No, I went to the very first one that was at that other convention center downtown that I don't think they have it at anymore.
7676000	7679000	It's the same one that Anime Boston, I think, is at.
7679000	7684000	I think, yeah, it's the Boston Convention Center, which is really close to the airport, which is great.
7684000	7692000	Because I'm so used to, like, in Los Angeles and Seattle, it's like a 40-minute cab ride to get from the airport to the convention center.
7692000	7694000	In this one, it's like, you know, 10 bucks.
7694000	7700000	Well, the problem is LA is gigantic, and then the Seattle airport is actually Seattle-Tacoma.
7700000	7702000	So it's in between the two.
7702000	7704000	We had that nice limo ride.
7704000	7711000	Yeah, that was the first limo ride I ever took in my life was when we went to Penny Arcade Expo from the airport there.
7711000	7714000	Because we were like, we're rock stars, we're taking a limo.
7714000	7720000	Actually, when we did the DDR Freak moderator trip, they sprung for us to get limos from the...
7720000	7721000	Must be nice.
7721000	7722000	It was fun in Las Vegas.
7722000	7727000	Didn't you get to ride the limos for the Windows 7, the Microsoft Windows thing?
7727000	7729000	That was the second, that was after that PAX.
7729000	7731000	Okay, that was the E3, yeah.
7732000	7735000	And that video we made that never got put on the internet, but whatever.
7735000	7738000	Yeah, they stopped at the one that me and Glenn did.
7738000	7740000	That was the one they stopped at.
7740000	7743000	And they're like, we can send you the raw assets if you want to cut something together.
7743000	7745000	And we're like, no, that's not why we did it.
7747000	7754000	So the thing that's kind of funny is because I did a podcast with the Boston Bastard Brigade and Electric Sistahood,
7754000	7761000	and there was a whole bunch of other podcasters, and we did a podcast that's going to be coming out this week sometime.
7761000	7764000	We recorded it this morning at 10 AM.
7764000	7767000	It was actually a lot of fun being in there.
7767000	7768000	It was a round table type podcast.
7768000	7773000	But what struck me as interesting, and they had to cut off the end of the podcast because they were losing that room,
7773000	7777000	was that they were treating this a lot like E3.
7777000	7781000	And they're like, what do you think of PAX? What games did you play on the show floor?
7781000	7785000	And I couldn't get in that I'm like, I think they missed the point of PAX.
7785000	7790000	I mean, the show floor is a big part of it, but PAX is so much bigger than that.
7790000	7795000	And some of the stuff that I saw at PAX that really blew me away was not on the show floor.
7795000	7801000	I walked in, and this just hit my nostalgia bone. Two things hit my nostalgia bone.
7801000	7803000	I walked into one room. It's really dark.
7803000	7810000	And all it had in there, and I'm not kidding, 16 fully functional steel battalions.
7811000	7812000	That sounds awesome.
7812000	7818000	Eight of them were system link with the multiplayer game, and then they had four playing the single player.
7818000	7820000	That sounds like my house, except I have two.
7820000	7826000	Sixteen, all fully functional, and they had the one enforcer who knew everything about the game,
7826000	7832000	and he was yelling at people kind of military style and giving them, kind of like the old,
7832000	7837000	kind of like the spiel that you would get from Mecor if you're doing the battle tech pods and stuff.
7837000	7840000	So that was really neat. And then they had the classic console room.
7840000	7846000	And they actually did, in the corner, have like a Commodore 64 with a five and a quarter inch disk drive.
7846000	7851000	That you could load in, and they had the Apple IIe with the disks.
7851000	7858000	And just going through there, and that and MagFest, the music and game convention,
7858000	7864000	they had a room, and it was jam sessions, and Megaran performed in there outside of the normal concerts,
7864000	7869000	like the big name concerts. They had the smaller, lesser known bands actually perform in this room,
7869000	7876000	and it was all day. And that's what sets PAX apart from E3, even though if you listen to most podcasts,
7876000	7879000	they're going to concentrate on the E3 aspects of PAX.
7882000	7887000	But what about that show floor? Because there were some games that showed up that we hadn't heard of yet,
7887000	7894000	like Hearthstone, and we talked earlier in the show about Saints Row IV, and the DuckTales game from Capcom.
7894000	7900000	Okay, let me start here, okay? Because we rag on Capcom, right?
7900000	7901000	Right, of course.
7901000	7906000	We mess everything up. I mean, I thought that I had played the worst demo in the world, Ni No Kuni.
7906000	7912000	And then Capcom comes along and Capcom's the demo. Because Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate,
7912000	7917000	the worst demo I have ever played. Ni No Kuni is no longer the worst demo I've ever played.
7917000	7922000	Yeah, no, I actually mentioned, you were surprised on the plane we were doing Gaming Week,
7922000	7927000	but I actually mentioned you and that whole thing in Gaming Week, because I hated the demo as well.
7927000	7931000	But I have friends that love Monster Hunter, and I'm like, I wouldn't know that from this demo.
7931000	7937000	And so, yeah, I think I landed, and we were on the Classic Game of the Week when I got in my car from the airport.
7937000	7946000	Anyway, I'll catch the podcast. So, I learned, okay, they're doing DuckTales, and I'm like, they can't mess this up.
7946000	7953000	How can Capcom mess this up? I just, I just, you can't, I mean, it was perfect, and stuff.
7953000	7955000	You want to know how Capcom messed this up?
7955000	7957000	They let the Pink Palace developers do it.
7957000	7960000	No, no, no, here's how they messed it up at PAX.
7960000	7961000	How?
7961000	7965000	There's only one copy of the game in the entire city of Boston.
7965000	7971000	One copy on one single kiosk. It's a seven-minute demo.
7971000	7978000	The line went around the corner of the booth, and they had to cap it because it was already four hours long.
7978000	7982000	To play the seven-minute demo. It was the only copy they had.
7982000	7986000	They did not have any other copies for press to go behind the scenes.
7986000	7990000	They do a GDC. They're going to be shown at a GDC behind the scenes to people who are going to be there.
7990000	7995000	But that was the only copy they had, and, see, here's the thing that a lot of people probably don't realize,
7995000	7999000	is that Capcom in that panel announced two games.
7999000	8004000	They announced DuckTales, and they announced this remake of the old Dungeons & Dragons four-player arcade game.
8004000	8009000	And so their idea was they were going to have those two games just next, side by side, next to each other.
8009000	8012000	Nobody's playing the Dungeons & Dragons game.
8012000	8013000	Oh, that's sad.
8013000	8015000	I know, that game is absolutely awesome.
8015000	8017000	To be fair, though, news about that one had leaked last week.
8017000	8019000	Because I remember talking about it on last week's show.
8019000	8021000	We already kind of knew that was coming.
8021000	8023000	But the DuckTales one was a complete surprise.
8023000	8027000	And so I was up there, and I asked the lady from Capcom,
8027000	8030000	I'm like, so, why do you only have one kiosk of this, that?
8030000	8032000	And she shot me this look.
8032000	8035000	Like, oh my god, I wish you had not asked that question.
8035000	8038000	And this is like an hour after they had unveiled that side of the booth.
8038000	8040000	It was covered up until the panel.
8040000	8044000	And so I, in order to save her, I was like, is that the million dollar question?
8044000	8047000	She's like, that's the five million dollar question.
8047000	8053000	So they are, they knew, like I think when everybody started singing in that panel,
8053000	8056000	I think they realized they messed up only bringing one copy of the game.
8056000	8060000	I think it's because it's running on dev kits, and they only have minimum amounts of dev kits.
8060000	8067000	That's exactly my thought, because remember, GDC is happening literally, what, tomorrow or Tuesday?
8067000	8068000	Starts Tuesday.
8068000	8072000	Yeah, when GDC starts, all the dev kits are probably in San Francisco.
8072000	8074000	They can't be in two places at once.
8074000	8076000	No, Rob, Passover starts tomorrow.
8076000	8077000	Anyway.
8077000	8080000	But what they could have done is since nobody's touching that stupid Dungeons and Dragons game,
8080000	8081000	make that DuckTales!
8081000	8082000	That's not stupid!
8082000	8086000	Put on the last stage, you know, cover up the Dungeons and Dragons with like a really,
8086000	8092000	you know, crude notebook paper and Sharpie saying DuckTales.
8092000	8093000	And just do that.
8093000	8097000	And then that four hour wait would have been a two hour wait.
8097000	8099000	I'm gonna get the one dude to come by.
8099000	8101000	Where's Dungeons and Dragons?
8101000	8104000	I heard there was a Dungeons and Dragons game, I wanna play it.
8104000	8107000	Dude, okay, the Dungeons and Dragons game is awesome, and I probably would have played that
8107000	8110000	if everyone else was over DuckTales.
8110000	8113000	Yeah, you could have walked right up to play that one.
8113000	8117000	But then there's the long line of everybody trying to watch DuckTales.
8117000	8120000	And what does it say about, I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing,
8120000	8124000	so this is an open question, what does this say about PAX in terms of game announcements,
8124000	8129000	considering this was not the only game announced there, that the most excited people got
8129000	8134000	over an announcement at PAX was a remake of an NES game?
8134000	8137000	It's one that's near and dear to everybody's hearts, though.
8137000	8142000	I mean, you go great NES games, and people remember, DuckTales is on a lot of lists.
8142000	8144000	So, I mean, I can kind of see it.
8144000	8147000	And it does look great.
8147000	8149000	I hope it delivers.
8150000	8157000	But aside from that, the best part about PAX is that they embrace the indie culture.
8157000	8162000	And the indie games. And the indie games take up pretty much half the show floor, is all indie games.
8162000	8166000	Probably even more so than your AAA titles.
8166000	8169000	Because you gotta realize Activision wasn't there, Sony really wasn't there that much,
8169000	8172000	they had The Last of Us, and that was about it.
8172000	8177000	But indie games, like just all these crazy ideas, I actually played on an Ouya.
8177000	8179000	Oh my gosh, they exist!
8179000	8182000	It exists, the controller is terrible.
8182000	8183000	Aw, Quincy!
8183000	8188000	It's unresponsive, but I actually played a game that actually makes use of that touchpad
8188000	8191000	in a way that makes sense.
8191000	8195000	In the same touchpad that's gonna be on the Playstation 4, the game I played there is a Saturday morning RPG.
8195000	8201000	It's an 8-bit, kind of, turn-based RPG, but with a lot of, like, some of the minigames in there,
8201000	8204000	you're playing Simon, and stuff like that.
8204000	8208000	It's about, like, basically Saturday morning cartoons or this kid's real life.
8208000	8211000	But right before each battle, you scratch off stickers.
8211000	8214000	And that's what you use the touchpad for.
8214000	8218000	By scratching, you act like you're scratching off a sticker.
8218000	8223000	So, it was a neat game, and it's actually a launch title for the Ouya, so I played that a little bit.
8223000	8227000	And the buttons on the Ouya controller, it's O-U-Y-A.
8227000	8228000	Of course.
8228000	8232000	And so it's like, press O to do this, so I press what winds up being the A button on the controller,
8232000	8235000	because that's the circle button on the Playstation controller.
8235000	8237000	It's gonna take some getting used to.
8237000	8240000	And even the developer said, I don't like the button placement.
8240000	8242000	Like, I don't like the way they did that.
8242000	8245000	Like, you know, they should have been some kind of standard or something.
8245000	8246000	But I did play that.
8246000	8250000	But there were some other neat things that I saw that I wasn't able to get interviews with.
8250000	8255000	There's, for the hardcore of the hardcore, I'm talking, like, I don't know if Dungeon Buster's in chat,
8255000	8257000	because, like, this is up his alley.
8257000	8258000	He is in chat.
8258000	8259000	Okay, he is in chat.
8259000	8261000	Dungeon Buster, this is straight up your alley.
8261000	8263000	The game's called Artemis.
8263000	8270000	And this is a spacecraft simulator, in the sense like the old Star Trek.
8270000	8272000	So imagine the Enterprise.
8272000	8278000	Except it's multiplayer across PC, iPad, iPhone, I think even Android.
8278000	8281000	And you are basically a crew member.
8281000	8284000	And so what they had set up, they had them on laptops there.
8284000	8286000	And they had five stations.
8286000	8293000	You have your captain, your science officer, your engineering officer, your navigation, and your weapons guy.
8293000	8295000	And you're all cross-talking.
8295000	8296000	You have your screen.
8296000	8300000	And the way they had it set up there is you had your screen that had, like, a radar and things you could do.
8300000	8304000	Then they had a main screen that actually had the 3D render of what it was doing.
8304000	8305000	And they were all talking to each other.
8305000	8308000	Okay, you know, turn the ship to 160 degrees.
8308000	8309000	You know, get close.
8309000	8311000	Okay, comm officer, request docking.
8311000	8314000	Comm officer will say, okay, you know, we've got permission to dock.
8314000	8317000	And then the navigation perk guy would actually dock with the station.
8317000	8319000	And then, you know, battle stuff.
8319000	8321000	They would look at, you know, okay, when do I turn on the shields?
8321000	8323000	And the captain would start yelling out orders.
8323000	8329000	And it's this social game where basically all of you are working together to fly the spaceship,
8329000	8333000	have space battles, and I guess deliver cargo and stuff.
8333000	8337000	It was amazingly interesting.
8337000	8340000	I didn't get a chance to play it because it was a 20-minute demo.
8340000	8342000	So it was kind of hard to get in on it.
8342000	8344000	But that's actually out now.
8344000	8349000	And here's the thing about Artemis, is that they don't like DRM.
8349000	8356000	And so what you can do is when you buy the game, you're actually buying a license to the ship.
8356000	8361000	So basically you buy that one ship, and they don't check for this.
8361000	8362000	So this is honor system.
8362000	8367000	But then you can send the game to five of your buddies as long as they're all flying on your ship.
8367000	8371000	So only one person has to buy the game for five people to fly the ship and play the game.
8371000	8372000	That's pretty cool.
8372000	8376000	It's kind of like a DS title where everybody can download from the one person.
8376000	8377000	I don't know, kind of.
8377000	8379000	That's kind of what I'm thinking of when you say that.
8379000	8380000	That's really cool.
8380000	8382000	So that was one of the games that I saw.
8382000	8385000	Another game that a lot of people were probably talking about,
8385000	8387000	I don't know if you ever heard of this game called Divekick.
8387000	8389000	I think so, yeah.
8389000	8394000	Divekick, this is the most complex fighting game ever.
8394000	8397000	And it's coming out for PlayStation 3 and Vita and stuff like that.
8397000	8402000	And the way that they had it there was that they actually had an arcade-style controller.
8402000	8406000	There are two buttons, dive and kick.
8406000	8409000	And so you select your character, and there were five characters in the game.
8409000	8414000	And one of them is kind of funny because the name of the character was Wolverine.
8414000	8415000	And so they got a cease and desist letter.
8415000	8421000	So the name of that character is now redacted with a strike through it.
8421000	8425000	So basically in Divekick, it's the standard thing.
8425000	8429000	And you have the little guy go, okay, ready? Divekick!
8429000	8434000	And then you can jump with the dive button and then kick with the kick button.
8434000	8436000	Or if you just hit the kick button, you dive.
8436000	8440000	And it's basically whoever hits the other person first, it's a one-shot kill.
8440000	8443000	Even though it shows all these health bars at the stop, but it's a one-hit thing.
8443000	8446000	And you're basically just jumping and diving, and that's all you're doing.
8446000	8452000	And it is the most hilarious, funny fighting game I've ever played.
8452000	8456000	So it sounds like you saw a lot of gems, really, like these little indie gems.
8456000	8458000	I did not see a bad game.
8458000	8459000	That's good.
8459000	8464000	I did not see a bad game. Even in the card game, board game section, I did not see a bad game.
8464000	8469000	Because the area was probably just as big as the video game section,
8469000	8473000	but they had the whole tabletop section, and the entire perimeter of the tabletop section
8473000	8479000	were vendors and people showing off tabletop board games, card games, things like that.
8479000	8482000	And that was in there, and that's where I actually played a game that I actually did buy,
8482000	8488000	a card game called Flame War, which triggered my PTSD of the G4 forums thing.
8488000	8494000	Because you're playing as a forum moderator, trying to create forum threads and then closing them,
8494000	8497000	but the way that you attack other players, you flame on their threads.
8497000	8500000	And all the cards have internet memes on them.
8500000	8501000	Awesome.
8501000	8505000	And so I did buy it, and one of the cards is the ban hammer.
8505000	8509000	And so people that were around in the G4 days, they actually were selling a shirt of the ban hammer,
8509000	8513000	which was basically a hammer that said ban in it, and yes, I did buy that shirt.
8513000	8514000	Of course, you have to.
8514000	8518000	I have the ban hammer shirt, so anybody that remembers me from the G4 days will appreciate that.
8518000	8520000	That is amazing.
8520000	8527000	Obviously, you say PAX is a lot more than just the expo floor, the community and all that.
8527000	8530000	I saw some pictures on Facebook.
8530000	8533000	It looks like you guys were up very late playing Cards Against Humanity.
8533000	8536000	Yes, and that was pretty much like...
8536000	8539000	At Dragon Con, I'm used to seeing people in a circle playing Are You a Werewolf?
8539000	8542000	And here, everybody was playing Cards Against Humanity.
8542000	8547000	Because they released the third expansion, which sold out on Saturday.
8547000	8553000	But they also had these three PAX East exclusive packs that you could get.
8553000	8555000	If you found them, you got them.
8555000	8559000	And they were either in the swag bag or if you went to the Kickstarter room, you could get it from them.
8559000	8561000	And they were handing them out.
8561000	8564000	Cards Against Humanity was huge at PAX.
8564000	8568000	A lot of people were playing that everywhere that you looked.
8568000	8572000	I think that game took off.
8572000	8575000	I think that's a Kickstarter success story right there.
8575000	8579000	Probably Streetpassed with about 11 billion people.
8579000	8585000	Yes, I would have Streetpassed with more if I kept at it, but I wound up filling all my pieces and completing Find Me.
8586000	8590000	But I now have, I think, over 1,000 Streetpasses total.
8590000	8594000	And that's from all the E3 and all the other stuff that I've done with it.
8594000	8597000	I'm only up to 500 and I thought I had a ton from...
8597000	8599000	Well, you see, I thought I had a ton too.
8599000	8602000	And then I was sitting next to somebody when I went into the Rock Band panel.
8602000	8605000	Which is the only panel I went to, which was the behind the scenes.
8605000	8608000	They named names and everything. It was awesome. It's never going to be broadcast.
8608000	8611000	But I was sitting there and he had like 2,800.
8611000	8615000	And I remarked on it and he just looked at me and was like, I'm a cast member at Disney World.
8620000	8624000	And so the Rock Band panel was, you're never going to see it broadcast.
8624000	8628000	Because they actually spent about 10 minutes saying, we could get in so much trouble if you...
8628000	8632000	And they're looking right at the IGN and the Polygon guys in the front row with their laptops out.
8632000	8635000	And they kept looking and they're like, don't write this. Please don't write this.
8635000	8637000	Because they actually were naming names.
8638000	8643000	And talking about, here's where we fucked up, is basically what it was.
8643000	8648000	And they went through, hey, we announced Rock Band Japan. Yeah, let's tell you what happened with that.
8648000	8651000	And they were showing video, like concept video of Rock Band Japan.
8651000	8657000	And basically Rock Band Japan died because Japanese licensing is worse than American music licensing.
8657000	8659000	And people in Japan have small rooms.
8662000	8666000	But they also talked about Pearl Jam Rock Band, which actually was announced by Pearl Jam.
8667000	8673000	But they actually showed concept video of that and how it was going to be about the Pearl Jam live experience.
8673000	8677000	Because Pearl Jam is a very active bootlegging culture and live video.
8677000	8679000	So they were actually putting it around their...
8679000	8683000	And the video in the background was actually going to be video footage from a lot of these concerts.
8683000	8685000	Iconic Pearl Jam concerts.
8685000	8688000	And it just, for whatever reason, it didn't work out.
8688000	8691000	And they then coughed and said, any better.
8692000	8696000	But then they talked about, yes, we know you want Muse.
8696000	8701000	And they basically kind of explained how something happened and that's why they don't have Muse.
8701000	8708000	They actually talked about Pink Floyd and actually how they made concept video of doing Dreamscape type of stuff with Pink Floyd tracks.
8708000	8711000	The Beatles Pink style stuff.
8711000	8716000	And they actually had concept art that they sent off to Pink Floyd and it just never happened.
8716000	8719000	Same, Led Zeppelin also had a little bit of that.
8719000	8721000	They had some stuff like that.
8721000	8723000	And then they talked about the Guns N' Roses debacle.
8723000	8729000	And just kind of the highlight of this was where apparently there was a leaked video that came out.
8729000	8735000	A viral video that went out of an unnamed harmonics employee, which everybody tried to name.
8735000	8740000	Saying, hey, we got the entire Guns N' Roses library, Appetite for Destruction, everything.
8740000	8742000	And we're going to do this and this and this and this.
8742000	8744000	And it was a hoax.
8744000	8746000	It was a hoax video, but it was an extremely believable hoax.
8747000	8750000	And it turns out it was by somebody who at the time was just a dumb kid.
8750000	8753000	Now he's in the game industry and they're like, should we name him?
8753000	8754000	Yeah, we're going to name him.
8754000	8757000	Dan Rickert, who was like one of the head guys at Game Informer now.
8757000	8762000	Is the person who actually made that video and made harmonics life a living hell.
8762000	8763000	Oh my gosh.
8763000	8764000	For several months.
8764000	8766000	Wow.
8766000	8769000	So, but of course no news on the future.
8769000	8774000	I mean, I know we got the news about American Pie being the last DLC song.
8774000	8775000	That's the big song.
8775000	8777000	But nothing about the future, of course, right?
8777000	8781000	No, but I did get to, because I do know both Nick Chester and John Drake.
8781000	8784000	And I was up to see both of them during the show.
8784000	8788000	And I didn't ask them what they were working on because I knew they couldn't tell me about that.
8788000	8790000	And I asked them, will I think it's cool?
8790000	8793000	And I told them, hey, I've been with you guys since frequency days.
8793000	8796000	And John looked at me and he's like, you will find this cool.
8796000	8798000	You will find what we're doing cool.
8798000	8799000	We're going to announce it.
8799000	8801000	We're hoping to announce it at E3.
8801000	8802000	He's like 95% sure.
8802000	8804000	He doesn't want to say anything more than that.
8804000	8809000	But I told him, yeah, I was with you in the frequency and amplitude days and all that stuff.
8809000	8811000	And he's like, it's not rock band.
8811000	8816000	But considering what I like of Harmonics' past, he says, I will think that what they're coming up with is cool.
8816000	8818000	And he's very excited about it.
8818000	8820000	And that's all I could get out of him.
8820000	8823000	Well, Bobby, it sure sounds like we missed a heck of a show.
8823000	8826000	I'm sad, but it is what it is.
8826000	8829000	But anything else about PAX East you want to share with us?
8830000	8833000	I got a whole ton of interviews.
8833000	8837000	I am going to be probably putting them out on my podcast, or some of them on my podcast feed.
8837000	8843000	Because if I did one a week, every week, they would go until June.
8843000	8847000	Tell us more about Saints Row IV.
8847000	8850000	Well, I did see Saints Row IV.
8850000	8851000	And I'm going to break this news.
8851000	8853000	I told Rob about this.
8853000	8856000	Because now Deep Silver is handling Saints Row IV.
8856000	8859000	I have a very good relationship with Deep Silver.
8859000	8864000	So, you know, THQ never gave me the time of day, but Deep Silver did.
8864000	8870000	And they were showing Saints Row IV to the press in the hotel that's connected to the convention center.
8870000	8872000	Instead of having to wait in line.
8872000	8876000	And also that way they weren't bumping people out of the line, bumping attendees.
8876000	8878000	They had press in a different area.
8878000	8881000	And so I went in there, and it's the same video.
8881000	8884000	The same ten minute video that they were showing everybody else.
8884000	8887000	And they had developers in there, and they're like, yeah, interviews and stuff.
8887000	8888000	You know, do interviews.
8888000	8889000	So I went up to our PR contact.
8889000	8890000	Her name is Stephanie Shop.
8890000	8892000	She is amazing.
8892000	8896000	And I went up, and Stephanie Shop also, if you listen to my show,
8896000	8900000	she was responsible for getting the MechWarrior online, and the Devolver Digital,
8900000	8903000	and all those interviews, the ones I did kind of in November.
8903000	8906000	She was responsible for setting all those up.
8906000	8910000	And I was like, hey, you know, so can I get an interview with one of the Saints Row guys?
8910000	8911000	The developers.
8911000	8914000	And she looked at me and said, no, you can't.
8914000	8916000	And I'm like, okay.
8916000	8920000	And she's like, because I'd rather you do one of your long form Skype interviews
8920000	8922000	in a couple weeks with them.
8922000	8924000	Nice. Very nice.
8924000	8927000	Because it would be a five to ten minute quickie interview there,
8927000	8933000	and she's like, I'd rather you do one of your long form ones with these guys.
8933000	8935000	So you don't have a date yet, though, right?
8935000	8936000	No date.
8936000	8938000	Well, because she's heading off to GDC.
8938000	8941000	I'm not bugging her until after GDC.
8941000	8942000	Sure, sure.
8942000	8946000	But she said she does want to do it in the next couple weeks, so it could be pretty soon.
8946000	8947000	Awesome.
8947000	8950000	Well, it sounds like you made a lot of great connections at PAX East.
8950000	8953000	You had a really good time, making us all jealous we didn't go.
8953000	8957000	But hey, there's Dragon Con and E3, hopefully.
8957000	8958000	You're going to have a great time at Dragon Con.
8958000	8960000	We are going to have a great time at Dragon Con.
8960000	8961000	No, I'm seriously looking forward to it.
8961000	8963000	It's going to be great.
8963000	8966000	And yeah, I mean, I probably do have more stories.
8966000	8971000	I saw a lot of other great indie games, some that weren't even on the show floor that I got to see.
8971000	8975000	And those interviews are going to be airing throughout the next couple weeks,
8975000	8978000	and we're going to be getting some review copies of those.
8978000	8984000	And it's a good time to be a gamer. Shut up with the hate.
8984000	8991000	Of all the stuff I did, I did not see a single bad game, even looking through all the indie stuff.
8991000	8994000	I did not see a single bad game.
8994000	9001000	Transistor. I think that's the Supergiant games from Bastion.
9001000	9003000	If you want to know what my game of show is.
9003000	9004000	That?
9004000	9005000	That's it.
9005000	9006000	Interesting.
9006000	9008000	That was the last thing I played.
9008000	9012000	That was the last thing I did before going to the airport was I got to play that game.
9012000	9016000	And it is Bastion in the future with...
9016000	9021000	It's different enough from Bastion, but you can tell that it's a love of Bastion.
9021000	9024000	Logan Cunningham comes back to do the voice, but he's doing a little bit different voice,
9024000	9027000	and instead of being the narrator, he's actually the voice of your sword.
9027000	9030000	That's how they work the narration into it.
9030000	9032000	So your sword's constantly talking to you.
9032000	9037000	And it's not narration, the sword's actually giving you direction and advice.
9037000	9042000	And you can stop time and queue up actions, and it's all badass and everything.
9042000	9045000	That probably is my game of show.
9045000	9049000	SSG100Matt says his girlfriend agrees with you. Transistor's the game of the show.
9049000	9052000	Didn't the talking sword thing happen in a Mercedes Lackey novel?
9052000	9055000	I think it's distant enough that it's alright.
9055000	9056000	It actually did.
9056000	9058000	I think it's distant enough that it's alright.
9058000	9061000	Well, Bobby, I know you're going to have plenty to say on the next episode of your show.
9061000	9064000	I can't imagine there's a person listening to this that doesn't know about your show,
9064000	9067000	but just in case, please plug away.
9067000	9072000	I am the opening band, not the band that you came to see.
9072000	9076000	But I'll only be here for five or six songs, and then I'll go away.
9076000	9082000	An hour before O.O.R., 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific on Sunday nights.
9082000	9087000	Usually it's me doing a monologue for 30 minutes, taking calls from Break Man for another 20 minutes,
9087000	9089000	and then talking to you guys for 10 minutes.
9089000	9094000	And that's my show, and we've got a lot of great interviews coming up.
9094000	9101000	A game book being put into iPad, an old-style 80s game book, Steve Jackson's Sorcery.
9101000	9105000	It plays like an Infocom text adventure as well, but looks really great.
9105000	9107000	We're going to talk to them.
9107000	9113000	An iPad brawler that does not use virtual controls, and it plays more like Fruit Ninja,
9113000	9115000	and it actually does work.
9115000	9119000	I do get to talk to Phoenix Online Studios with Cognition and the silver lining
9119000	9122000	in the next game that they're doing with Jane Jensen.
9122000	9127000	I got to talk to Mommy's Best Games about guns on top of guns and on top of guns.
9127000	9130000	Nathan Fouts, he's also been on Fox News a lot recently,
9130000	9133000	and we talk about why that happened and what he thinks of that.
9133000	9139000	So there's a lot of great content that I've got in my suitcase that is still locked up
9139000	9141000	and sitting in the hallway because I ran in here.
9141000	9143000	All right, Bobby, go unpack.
9143000	9145000	We're going to let you go so we can get a couple more calls,
9145000	9147000	but thanks so much for spending some time with us tonight.
9147000	9151000	No problem, and remember, if Legend of Zaku calls in and he's all like,
9151000	9153000	That's not him.
9153000	9155000	It's really a funny guy.
9155000	9156000	It's an act.
9156000	9158000	It's an act.
9158000	9163000	All right, Bobby Black Wolf Show calling out the OLR regulars tonight.
9163000	9165000	All right, have a good one, Bobby.
9165000	9166000	Take care.
9166000	9168000	Take care. Bye.
9168000	9170000	The one and only Bobby Black Wolf, everybody.
9170000	9173000	We let him go a little long tonight, but you know what?
9173000	9176000	I'm excited to hear from some people that were at PAX East.
9176000	9180000	He always has us on our show, or he always has us on his show.
9180000	9183000	It's the least we can do, and he has a lot of great info from the floor.
9183000	9185000	I'm hoping we'll get some more PAX East-related calls,
9185000	9187000	like maybe this next one that's coming in right now.
9187000	9189000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9189000	9191000	Hey, it's Legend of Zaku here.
9191000	9193000	Well, were your ears burning?
9193000	9195000	Because someone was just talking about you.
9195000	9198000	Yeah, I heard it in the car right over.
9198000	9204000	I heard it right as the car was pulling up to my house.
9204000	9206000	So, Zaku, is it all an act?
9206000	9208000	Is this all an act?
9208000	9215000	Maybe, but not like sidebar and focus on the real task at hand,
9215000	9217000	which was PAX East.
9217000	9222000	All right, well, let's talk about the real reason why you called tonight.
9222000	9225000	PAX East, so you were obviously at the show, too, because you met Bobby.
9225000	9226000	How was it?
9226000	9228000	I was rooming with him, actually.
9228000	9230000	Were you really? Awesome.
9230000	9234000	But then it got shifted when we got into the other hotel.
9234000	9240000	I'm not going to say as to the reasons why, but he knows it very well,
9240000	9242000	and we'll leave it at that.
9243000	9251000	Long story short, this PAX, the way I put it, it was average.
9251000	9260000	Last year's PAX, amongst all the swag and the parties, it doesn't hold a candle.
9260000	9267000	Case in point, Curse's PAX East party this year wasn't even open bar,
9267000	9270000	and they oversold it to the point where you only had one free drink,
9270000	9273000	and then everything else you had to pay at the cash bar.
9273000	9279000	The economy is really sons of bitches close to the open bar.
9279000	9281000	That's why I came to this thing.
9283000	9285000	You know what, though? Perfectly legit.
9285000	9289000	PAX East, not as good, because they closed the open bar this year.
9289000	9291000	Fuck them.
9291000	9295000	That is true, and then it was surprising,
9295000	9299000	aside from trying my best to play some of these things,
9299000	9302000	given the fact that there were lines just about everywhere,
9302000	9305000	so I only got to play very few things.
9305000	9309000	I was able to get Hawken to play that game.
9309000	9317000	I also tried out the Nvidia Shield, the new handheld controller device that they have,
9317000	9321000	which is kind of nifty, though, because it's using the latest version of Android.
9321000	9325000	The latest one that you see on the Nexus 4 and the latest tablets,
9325000	9327000	that's exactly the one they're running.
9327000	9335000	It really feels like a top-tier device.
9335000	9337000	I'm not just bullshitting or anything.
9337000	9340000	I'm just saying it also has touchscreen,
9340000	9350000	but it feels like you're actually playing a recent, current-gen console.
9350000	9353000	And the graphics are on par.
9353000	9359000	They're like 360 graphics from launch titles.
9359000	9369000	It's gotten to the point where mobile's pretty much at or tailing right now the big-boy consoles.
9369000	9373000	You talked about a lot of these lines for games.
9373000	9375000	Did you wait in any of them?
9375000	9378000	Did you stand in that epic line to play DuckTales?
9378000	9380000	No, that's the thing.
9380000	9386000	I was just going around the con, around the expo hall.
9386000	9389000	I did my best to try to score as much free swag as possible,
9389000	9391000	but yeah, it was slim pickings this year.
9391000	9392000	You're a fan of free stuff.
9392000	9395000	I wouldn't be able to guess from your talk about the Curse party.
9395000	9401000	What fun nightlife did these Paxis have? Anything?
9401000	9409000	I mean, most of the nightlife was either you went to the local bars near the hotels,
9409000	9412000	which was like the day before the con,
9412000	9417000	which was a pub crawl that basically stayed in one place because it took too long.
9417000	9421000	But other than that, it was just like whatever you had in your room,
9421000	9423000	if you had Cards Against Humanity,
9423000	9427000	you were basically playing not only with your roommates,
9427000	9432000	but with random strangers that would just bring bottles of high-end liquor,
9432000	9437000	like Johnny Walker, like a leader Johnny Walker for that table.
9437000	9440000	And I was like, we're taking big swigs of it.
9440000	9443000	And as a result, I had to nurse a hangover this morning.
9443000	9445000	I was just about to ask, I was going to say,
9445000	9450000	your eyes are looking a little bit like you haven't slept in about four days.
9450000	9453000	No, it's like I puked this morning.
9454000	9455000	Yeah.
9457000	9460000	I was going to say you have that sort of Prize Fighter look about you.
9460000	9462000	Like I wasn't going to say he got in a fight,
9462000	9465000	but he definitely has that whole like, I had a hell of a weekend,
9465000	9466000	don't you ask me?
9466000	9468000	My face was just crunching up, tightening up,
9468000	9472000	because I was lurching over the toilet trying to puke.
9472000	9475000	Were you offering your sacrifices to the porcelain goddess?
9476000	9478000	Porcelain goddess, yes.
9478000	9482000	Sacrificing my dignity.
9483000	9486000	But aside from the newer games that were out
9486000	9490000	and the fact that they were just like, you know,
9490000	9492000	aside from the lines and everything else,
9492000	9496000	board games were pretty much another huge aspect of it.
9496000	9501000	It got to the point where I actually have gotten my girlfriend.
9501000	9505000	I know, well, for those who probably can't see the camera, but...
9505000	9507000	That's our weekend.
9507000	9511000	Spartacus board game.
9511000	9513000	Is that based on the TV show?
9513000	9514000	Yes.
9514000	9516000	How much full frontal is in the board game?
9516000	9517000	Huh?
9517000	9519000	How much full frontal is in the board game?
9519000	9520000	None.
9522000	9525000	My girlfriend would be disappointed, yeah.
9525000	9527000	That's all she watches it for, full frontal,
9527000	9531000	and then her dad watches along with her for the boobs.
9531000	9534000	That's kind of awkward, but all right.
9534000	9539000	Yeah, I mean, everywhere, like, yeah, board games,
9539000	9543000	like, it got to the point where it was like,
9543000	9547000	at this point, it's like a good third board games,
9547000	9551000	another third indie, or more importantly,
9551000	9554000	probably like a quarter indie, and then everything else.
9554000	9555000	All right, let me ask...
9555000	9557000	I'm still waiting for Mass Effect Risk.
9557000	9559000	Let me ask you one more question, Zaku.
9559000	9561000	Since you say you weren't as big on PAX East this year
9561000	9563000	as you were, like, last year,
9563000	9566000	what can PAX 2014 learn from this year?
9566000	9570000	How can PAX East 2014 set up to be the most kick-ass one yet,
9570000	9572000	besides open bars?
9572000	9579000	All right, I guess it's the panels that I tried my best
9579000	9581000	to actually go to.
9581000	9584000	Like, this year I did better than the fact that I did,
9584000	9587000	like, one, two, three, four...
9587000	9589000	I think I did, like, six panels,
9589000	9591000	one of which I had to duck out because of my hangover,
9591000	9595000	but, yeah, it's gotten better.
9595000	9597000	The content has gotten a lot better.
9597000	9600000	Obviously, it still packs up pretty badly.
9600000	9604000	Like, obviously, the Bioshock panel fills up rather quickly.
9604000	9605000	Of course.
9605000	9608000	But it's just like trying to...
9608000	9611000	I guess they can't please everybody.
9611000	9614000	So the best they could do is stay where they are
9614000	9616000	because they have...
9616000	9620000	Their venue can handle whatever crowd size
9620000	9621000	they're throwing in.
9621000	9623000	I wouldn't be surprised if next year
9623000	9625000	it'll be almost, like, 100 grand, 100,000 attendees.
9625000	9626000	Oh, my gosh.
9626000	9628000	But then, yeah, that's gonna, like, you're...
9628000	9633000	It's gonna get to the point where people are just gonna get in the way
9633000	9637000	and then it's gonna be massive line waiting for, like, you know,
9637000	9639000	for stuff like Watch Dogs,
9639000	9641000	which I heard was a major disappointment over there,
9641000	9646000	which was showing, like, clips and rehash footage that was already out.
9646000	9648000	Oh, that's gotta be irritating.
9648000	9649000	You're waiting a big old long line
9649000	9652000	and then it's just some damn movie you already saw on the internet.
9652000	9653000	Square Enix Theater.
9653000	9654000	Yeah, right.
9654000	9659000	The only cool thing about PAX this year was
9659000	9661000	the classic gaming had...
9661000	9663000	Well, aside from having the standard setup,
9663000	9667000	like, one room dedicated to just classic gaming of consoles,
9667000	9668000	they had another one.
9668000	9670000	They had a featured room.
9670000	9673000	And this year's feature was Steel Battalion.
9673000	9674000	Like, they had 12 of these.
9674000	9675000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9676000	9679000	Just playing Steel Battalion is not even fun.
9679000	9680000	It's just work.
9681000	9685000	Start up the next computer.
9685000	9686000	Do systems check.
9686000	9689000	Next time it needs to come with some vodka.
9689000	9690000	It'll be a whole lot better.
9690000	9691000	Alright.
9692000	9694000	Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls,
9694000	9696000	but thanks so much for the report,
9696000	9699000	and I'm glad to hear at least you had a decent enough times
9699000	9701000	that you were regretting it this morning.
9702000	9703000	Yeah.
9703000	9706000	Also, they were giving away free Android Bluetooth controllers.
9706000	9707000	Nice.
9707000	9708000	For Android-owned users.
9708000	9709000	Yeah.
9709000	9710000	Where's mine?
9710000	9711000	Alright.
9711000	9712000	Alright, Zaku.
9712000	9713000	Gotta let you go, buddy.
9713000	9714000	Take care.
9714000	9715000	Okay.
9715000	9716000	Bye.
9716000	9717000	Props to Zaku, an OLR gold store.
9717000	9718000	A gold store?
9718000	9719000	Well, he can have a whole store.
9719000	9722000	A gold star for Zaku for doing a video call
9722000	9724000	so we can actually see the Spartacus game that he bought.
9724000	9725000	Good times.
9725000	9727000	Alright, we'll see if anybody else wants to call.
9727000	9729000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9729000	9732000	Our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9732000	9734000	Making us all jealous we weren't there.
9734000	9735000	You alright?
9735000	9737000	I just saw something terrifying.
9737000	9738000	What's that?
9738000	9740000	A goblin shark.
9740000	9741000	That does sound terrifying.
9741000	9743000	They have retractable jaws.
9743000	9746000	Much less terrifying this next phone call.
9746000	9747000	Hi.
9747000	9748000	Hello, Olarians.
9748000	9749000	Hello, what's up?
9749000	9750000	Hi.
9750000	9751000	You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
9751000	9752000	Who's this?
9752000	9753000	It's CatastrophicMoggie.
9753000	9754000	Hello.
9754000	9755000	Nice to meet you.
9755000	9756000	And we even...
9756000	9757000	I thought I'd never get through.
9757000	9758000	You never get through.
9758000	9759000	Wow.
9759000	9760000	Yay.
9760000	9761000	Wait.
9761000	9762000	Hold on.
9762000	9767000	The clock on the wall behind you, 3.52 in the morning?
9767000	9768000	Yes.
9768000	9769000	Oh my.
9769000	9770000	You told me it was going to stay up for us.
9770000	9771000	Wow.
9771000	9774000	Yeah, I did say to that was Kara I would.
9774000	9778000	We usually do our chatting when it's four in the morning for me.
9778000	9780000	And here you are.
9780000	9781000	Well, what's up?
9781000	9784000	I was going to complain about region locking
9784000	9790000	and how I'm so unexcited by the current news about consoles.
9790000	9793000	But I thought you've already had so much time.
9793000	9795000	I thought I'd bring up something from weeks ago.
9795000	9796000	Sure.
9796000	9799000	Go for it.
9799000	9800000	The last...
9800000	9801000	Oh, pardon me.
9801000	9802000	Sorry.
9802000	9804000	I'm completely fumbling over my words now.
9804000	9805000	That's all right.
9805000	9806000	I do it all the time.
9806000	9807000	It's true.
9807000	9808000	He does.
9808000	9809000	Yeah.
9809000	9810000	We have to listen to three hours of it.
9810000	9811000	Hey.
9811000	9813000	I get to make fun of me.
9813000	9814000	Me.
9814000	9823000	Weeks ago, you were talking, I can't remember what it was about, about your other halves
9823000	9825000	guesting on OLR.
9825000	9826000	Was it?
9826000	9829000	And I thought, your last episode.
9829000	9830000	Go on.
9830000	9831000	Go on.
9831000	9832000	Go.
9832000	9835000	After your last episode, you should...
9835000	9836000	Okay.
9836000	9837000	He's on.
9837000	9838000	He's on.
9838000	9839000	He's on.
9839000	9840000	He's on.
9841000	9842000	Okay.
9842000	9844000	He's on the internet.
9844000	9845000	Yes.
9845000	9846000	Where is it?
9846000	9847000	It's Fourn and Horning.
9847000	9848000	Shh.
9848000	9849000	Quiet.
9849000	9852000	For your last episode, you should have...
9852000	9859000	Or for your E3 special, you should have the other half special with Alan, Dan, and...
9859000	9860000	Nelly.
9860000	9861000	Nelly.
9861000	9862000	Pardon.
9862000	9866000	Or and with your mum being a guest co-spond.
9866000	9867000	That would be hilarious.
9867000	9870000	We've talked about him before, and I'm sure Dan and Alan would be down.
9870000	9875000	It would just be about convincing Nelly that it's a really funny idea, but that might be
9875000	9876000	difficult.
9876000	9878000	Nelly would probably punch my husband.
9878000	9881000	And then I'd have to be here to see that.
9881000	9883000	You'd have to video it.
9883000	9884000	Yes.
9884000	9885000	It would have to be a video thing.
9885000	9886000	I don't know.
9886000	9891000	Maybe the only way I could see that happening is if we promised Nelly it was the last episode
9891000	9896000	of the show ever, because she'd be like, yay, Matt can have a life now.
9896000	9902000	Yeah, you should do it either for the last episode or an E3 special.
9902000	9903000	We'll see.
9903000	9904000	We'll see.
9904000	9907000	It'd be like we couldn't be bothered to show up, so our spouses do it.
9907000	9911000	So we've had a bunch of people calling in to talk about PAX East tonight.
9911000	9914000	Obviously, you're a little far away, so I'm imagining you didn't make it to PAX East,
9914000	9917000	but what do you think about everything you're hearing?
9917000	9920000	Honestly, I've not heard much news from PAX East.
9920000	9923000	Most of what I've heard is from you.
9924000	9928000	My biggest reaction is I wish DuckTales was coming to PC.
9928000	9929000	Oh, yeah.
9929000	9931000	They didn't announce it for PC, did they?
9931000	9937000	I have a policy of not getting digital content on consoles.
9937000	9939000	I can see why.
9939000	9940000	You know what, though?
9940000	9945000	One time when it won't transfer over, and at least with physical stuff you can trade
9945000	9948000	it in with digital stuff, you're stuck with it for now.
9948000	9954000	If it does well enough, though, they'll put it on disk.
9954000	9958000	If it's going to be on Xbox, though, it shouldn't be that hard to port it to PC.
9958000	9959000	Yeah.
9959000	9960000	I hope so.
9960000	9964000	Anyway, I take up too much of your time, so I'll get off now.
9964000	9965000	No worries.
9965000	9969000	It's a pleasure to hear from you and to get to see you, and I know you've got to shut
9969000	9972000	up because people are trying to sleep, but thank you for breaking all the rules in your
9972000	9974000	household to call us tonight.
9974000	9976000	I'm getting shouted at.
9976000	9977000	Bye.
9977000	9978000	Bye.
9978000	9979000	Bye.
9979000	9980000	Bye.
9980000	9981000	Bye.
9981000	9982000	Bye.
9982000	9983000	Bye.
9983000	9984000	Bye.
9984000	9985000	Bye.
9985000	9986000	Bye.
9986000	9987000	Bye.
9987000	9988000	We got someone in trouble.
9988000	9989000	We got someone in trouble.
9989000	9990000	Alright.
9990000	9993000	One eight seven seven game OLR, or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9993000	9996000	That was a great call, though.
9996000	9997000	It's true, though.
9997000	10001000	I usually, because I'm up around like four in the morning, and usually that's right when
10001000	10006000	he's on, so we end up chatting about stuff.
10006000	10011000	Bobby and ActDeft in our chat room talking a little bit about the DuckTales on PC thing.
10011000	10015000	ActDeft was convinced it was coming to PC, and BlackWolf says his sources say it's a
10015000	10017000	possibility eventually.
10017000	10018000	Not at launch, though.
10018000	10024000	I mean, after all, Resident Evil 6 I think just or is about to come out on Steam.
10024000	10027000	Sometimes PC's a little bit later, so just hold out.
10027000	10028000	Just hold out, guys.
10028000	10029000	It might happen.
10029000	10030000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10030000	10031000	Who's this?
10031000	10032000	Hey, hey, hey.
10032000	10035000	It's Anime Jam Session calling live from the Mobile Jersey Mobile.
10035000	10036000	Holy crap.
10036000	10037000	It's all you guys.
10037000	10038000	I hope you're not driving.
10038000	10039000	No, I'm driving.
10039000	10040000	Okay.
10040000	10041000	Okay.
10041000	10047000	I was going to say, because if Ron shouldn't have been the one driving, we would have hung
10047000	10048000	up.
10048000	10050000	Just because you do not talk on your phone and drive.
10050000	10051000	I do it all the time.
10051000	10052000	Don't listen to me.
10052000	10054000	Yeah, and you're going to kill somebody, namely a turkey.
10054000	10055000	No, I'm not.
10055000	10056000	No, I'm not.
10056000	10057000	What?
10057000	10058000	All right.
10058000	10060000	Enough of Dark Soccer's lecturing.
10060000	10062000	You guys are coming back from PAX East.
10062000	10064000	Did you have a good time?
10064000	10070000	Yes, yes, yes, and I would like to let you know that as Executive Vice Chair of VOGCON
10070000	10076000	East 2013, we went over attendance capacity with the special guest of Cards Against Humanity.
10076000	10083000	We went to a total of 16 guests with special guest stars Johnny Walker Red.
10083000	10085000	Now, wait a minute.
10085000	10089000	We've had two other callers so far tonight from VOG at PAX East.
10089000	10091000	You're the first one to mention this con.
10091000	10093000	What exactly ended up happening?
10098000	10099000	Hello?
10099000	10100000	Are we losing them?
10100000	10101000	What was that?
10101000	10103000	We're kind of breaking in and out here.
10103000	10104000	That's okay.
10104000	10105000	We're breaking in and out here.
10105000	10108000	What ended up happening at this VOGCON?
10111000	10112000	Let's see.
10112000	10116000	Jovay Dea did Alcohol Bingo.
10116000	10123000	Zaku went game over because he drank not as much as everybody else.
10123000	10129000	And we did game plus inception equals game-ception.
10129000	10131000	You don't say?
10131000	10132000	Yes.
10132000	10134000	Yeah, we were playing a dice game.
10134000	10141000	The rules of the game were roll dice, make up rule, drink.
10141000	10143000	Those were the rules of the game.
10143000	10144000	Yes.
10145000	10146000	Patent pending.
10148000	10151000	The name of the game is called game.
10151000	10158000	How many minutes were you sober during PAX East?
10158000	10159000	Too stupid.
10159000	10161000	More or less, yeah.
10161000	10162000	All right.
10162000	10165000	What did you guys see on the show floor that kicked ass?
10165000	10166000	Did you see anything out there?
10166000	10170000	Or even if it wasn't on the show floor, like in a side room or a panel or whatever,
10170000	10172000	what did you see that kicked ass?
10173000	10175000	DuckTales.
10175000	10178000	Did you actually wait in that hideous line to play it or did you just run up and-
10178000	10180000	Hell no!
10180000	10184000	No, DuckTales is one of those games where I will be buying it regardless.
10184000	10186000	Yeah, that's true.
10186000	10188000	You don't need a demo to sell you, huh?
10188000	10189000	Nope.
10189000	10192000	I will say this though.
10192000	10196000	Twitch TV was having a giveaway for the DuckTales poster.
10196000	10199000	They wanted people to sing the DuckTales theme.
10199000	10202000	So me, my brother, and Jove were there.
10202000	10204000	I tried to get Jove to sing.
10204000	10205000	Yeah, right.
10205000	10210000	I went up there with my bro, and the camera was on us, and after we sang the song,
10210000	10212000	dude in the booth's like,
10212000	10214000	yeah, give the dude with the Vox shirt a poster,
10214000	10217000	because he actually sang the words.
10217000	10218000	Nice.
10218000	10221000	Way to- good job name checking the station too.
10221000	10223000	It's always a good thing.
10223000	10224000	We love-
10224000	10225000	Well, we got-
10226000	10231000	Well, we got to thank Ukchon for that because of how big the VOG logo is on our shirts.
10231000	10232000	Mm-hmm.
10232000	10234000	Good job.
10234000	10238000	Well, I know you guys are on your way home, and you got to get there safe and everything,
10238000	10243000	but since you guys are going to be talking about this undoubtedly on Anime Jam Session this Tuesday,
10243000	10245000	what do we have to look forward to?
10245000	10249000	Our complete review, a whole lot of stuff.
10249000	10251000	But before we go, a couple of things.
10251000	10255000	Another game that's worth picking up is Lego City Undercover.
10255000	10256000	Really?
10257000	10260000	Yes. Are you a fan of the Shawshank Redemption?
10260000	10261000	Yes.
10263000	10268000	The game has a lot of pop culture references, including a scene from the Shawshank Redemption.
10268000	10271000	That's kind of random in a Lego game.
10271000	10272000	It's a prison break.
10272000	10279000	Basically, you have to go undercover into a prison and talk to one of the characters.
10279000	10281000	The character's name is Blue.
10281000	10283000	Okay, okay.
10283000	10287000	And you come to pick, and he starts talking like Morgan Freeman.
10287000	10293000	And some of the stuff he says, I was kind of hearing it.
10293000	10295000	I'm like, why do I know this?
10295000	10298000	And then he said something, and I'm like, Blue.
10298000	10301000	I'm like, aw, crap! It's Shawshank!
10301000	10303000	I love games that do that, though.
10303000	10308000	Actually, Shane was just showing me a screenshot earlier from the new Pokémon game that came out.
10309000	10311000	Earlier today, actually.
10311000	10314000	And what was the line here in this?
10314000	10316000	Hold on, I'm bringing it up right now.
10316000	10319000	I want to do this justice, because it's a great reference.
10319000	10322000	Especially if you're Grandpa from Hoard House.
10322000	10326000	One of the characters saying, you can call me Swanna if you want.
10326000	10328000	Just don't call me maybe.
10332000	10333000	That was bad.
10333000	10337000	Just as bad as the Nvidia Shield Controller.
10338000	10341000	Oh, was that on the show floor?
10341000	10344000	Yes, I played it. The controls were...
10344000	10346000	The controlling was weak.
10346000	10350000	The outline for doing the directional cross was really bad.
10350000	10354000	And the demo game was Sonic 4.
10354000	10359000	And when the song would end, it would pause for a half second and replay the track again.
10359000	10360000	I'm like, yeah, no.
10360000	10361000	Oh, lord.
10361000	10365000	You know, Bobby was not a big fan of the Ouya Controller.
10365000	10368000	Did you get to see that in comparison to the Nvidia one?
10368000	10372000	Ah, I did not know the Ouya was on display.
10372000	10373000	I did not know.
10373000	10376000	There's not enough time to see everything at one PAX.
10376000	10378000	It doesn't matter, I'll be getting in like a week.
10379000	10380000	Alright.
10380000	10381000	Um, okay.
10383000	10385000	I gotta let you know, guys, so we can go wrap up the show.
10385000	10387000	But any other last thoughts on PAX?
10389000	10393000	Get your butts out here for 2014 so we can do VOGCON 2014.
10393000	10397000	And unfortunately for ActDeaf, since he's a staffer, he does tech.
10397000	10401000	He'll be staffing the con for all three days, so by the time he gets off a shift,
10401000	10403000	all the fun stuff's already happened.
10404000	10405000	Womp womp.
10405000	10410000	Uh, you know, though, VOGCON 2013 is DragonCon,
10410000	10412000	and you got to Atlanta for one con this year,
10412000	10415000	so I expect you're gonna be able to make it twice.
10415000	10417000	Well, look at it this way.
10417000	10421000	If I graduate from college and I get those marks and I land the job,
10421000	10424000	we'll be partying our fabulous little asses off.
10424000	10426000	Awesome. We can play game.
10428000	10429000	Yes!
10430000	10432000	I challenge you to game.
10433000	10436000	That's not a challenge. That's a fun thing to do.
10436000	10439000	And you have to do it in deep Russian voices.
10439000	10440000	Oh, okay.
10440000	10441000	You know what, though?
10441000	10444000	It has to be better than what we did at Fonami,
10444000	10448000	which was just the one bottle of Malibu and us going all over the place looking for a soda.
10448000	10450000	How about this for the tagline?
10450000	10453000	In Soviet Russia, game play you!
10454000	10455000	That was it.
10455000	10459000	And Ookchan, if we're going to do that, Jovideh will be there with our kinky vodka.
10459000	10461000	Oh my god, the kinky vodka was so good.
10461000	10464000	Alright, I'm getting drunk off this conversation.
10464000	10465000	Rama, I gotta let you go.
10465000	10466000	Take care, you guys.
10466000	10470000	Big hug to all you guys at Anime Jam Session, Jovideh and whoever else might be with you.
10470000	10472000	Um, take care, guys, okay?
10473000	10474000	You got it. Thank you.
10474000	10475000	Bye!
10476000	10477000	Love it.
10477000	10480000	Alright, guys, sadly it is time I shut down the Skype line.
10480000	10482000	We have been taking Skype calls for about 40 minutes, you know.
10482000	10483000	But most of it was Bobby.
10483000	10485000	Well, yes, but, you know, with good reason.
10485000	10489000	But we had a lot from Zaku and Magi and, you know, Rama as well, so.
10489000	10491000	Appreciate everybody who called.
10491000	10493000	If you didn't get through tonight but you have something to say,
10493000	10494000	for the love of god, email us.
10494000	10497000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10497000	10499000	Give Dark Sakura some work to do next week.
10501000	10505000	In the meantime, some quick Twitter topics before I go for last minute stories.
10505000	10511000	TigerClaw305 wants to remind us that XCOM Enemy Unknown was announced for iOS.
10511000	10513000	I forgot about this but I did hear about this.
10513000	10517000	They're talking about they're going to be charging probably a little more money for it.
10517000	10519000	It's not going to be a 99 cent game.
10519000	10522000	Think more along like the lines of a $15 game.
10522000	10526000	But that would be in line with Squeenix pricing on iOS so it would make a lot of sense.
10526000	10531000	But, yeah, they say it's going to be just like you're playing it on PC or any of those.
10532000	10535000	I mean, XCOM makes sense to be on iPad.
10535000	10536000	It would work.
10536000	10538000	iPhone would be a little too tiny.
10538000	10539000	I don't know about that one.
10539000	10541000	Even iPad Mini might be a little much.
10541000	10542000	I don't know.
10543000	10546000	Dartusuya wanted to follow up on the rapid fire news.
10546000	10552000	If you bought La Mulana on Playism or Desura, you will get a Steam key after April 15th.
10552000	10555000	So some of you already are going to own this new La Mulana.
10555000	10560000	Also, for next week, since we're so close to 500 and with all the old school talk,
10560000	10563000	can we air Best Hits Part 1 next week?
10564000	10565000	Maybe.
10565000	10566000	We'll see.
10566000	10567000	I don't want to promise anything yet.
10567000	10569000	You never know what we might come up with.
10569000	10575000	And ActDeft also posted a story about Dust and Elysian Tail that was covered in our rapid fire news earlier.
10575000	10577000	Must have been in the restroom when we went over that.
10577000	10582000	But I will say this story does say that a sequel may be in the works.
10582000	10583000	Which, you know, game does well.
10583000	10584000	Sequel comes out.
10584000	10586000	That's no big surprise there.
10586000	10590000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us there and tweet us for a future week.
10591000	10592000	Last minute stories tonight.
10592000	10593000	Loki.
10593000	10594000	This is kind of cool.
10594000	10601000	They have put together this project called The Unleashed Project.
10601000	10607000	And what it is is a total conversion for Sonic Generations that's Sonic Unleashed.
10607000	10612000	Sonic Unleashed has been ported to PC completely.
10612000	10614000	And it runs better than it did on console.
10614000	10615000	Nice.
10616000	10619000	Because they're using the Generations engine.
10621000	10628000	And Unleashed, I'm talking about all the actual non-werewolf, werehog levels.
10628000	10631000	We're talking about all the good levels.
10631000	10632000	All the good ones.
10632000	10633000	Nice.
10635000	10636000	Alright, that's it?
10636000	10637000	Yeah, that's it.
10637000	10638000	Alright, that's it.
10638000	10641000	Well, that's going to wrap us up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10641000	10643000	This episode's going to have to suit you for two weeks.
10643000	10649000	But, you know, we've got an archive of about 497 episodes before this one.
10649000	10652000	So, if you need something to hold you over next week, go back and grab it.
10652000	10659000	All the podcasts are still on our server back through about 320.
10659000	10661000	So, there's plenty that are on the feed to grab.
10661000	10665000	If you need something before that, hit up Dark Tetsuya who's in our chat room.
10665000	10671000	He's got the link to the O-L archive where they dug up fucking episodes of Vanilla Sky.
10671000	10673000	And Guys on a Show.
10673000	10676000	They probably have your music show you used to do.
10676000	10678000	Somebody probably recorded that.
10678000	10682000	Which was all like, if I had to go out and run errands, I'd just put on Eddie Izzard.
10682000	10687000	People used to bootleg the shit out of Orange Lounge Radio, the station.
10687000	10691000	Now, all this time later, it's awesome that they did that, really.
10691000	10695000	I am also planning this Wednesday to be in Turntable.
10695000	10698000	Ah, I miss Turntable. Good times.
10698000	10703000	Doing, basically, what I used to do on my Pump of the Volume.
10703000	10705000	That's awesome. I miss Turntable. I always forget there.
10705000	10706000	Should we pop in there with me, Rob?
10706000	10708000	I very well might. Just let me know what night.
10708000	10710000	As long as it isn't when, what's the night?
10710000	10711000	It's still Wednesday.
10711000	10712000	Oh, Wednesday is Hoard House.
10712000	10713000	I'm doing it after Hoard House.
10713000	10714000	Okay, after Hoard House is fine.
10714000	10718000	This week is actually, I need to give this a shout out, Hoard House episode 100 is this Wednesday.
10718000	10719000	Nice.
10719000	10720000	Yeah, big milestone.
10720000	10721000	Milestone.
10721000	10723000	Giveaways on this week's show.
10723000	10726000	Give me some interest in WoW.
10726000	10728000	You've got the secret world, ain't it?
10728000	10733000	Oh, you know, I got it because it was on sale for 22 bucks instead of the full 30, so.
10733000	10734000	I don't blame you.
10734000	10735000	Yeah.
10735000	10736000	Check it out.
10736000	10737000	All right.
10737000	10738000	And I got yelled at for spending money.
10738000	10741000	Well, that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10741000	10745000	We just want to thank you guys for tuning in, supporting independent radio.
10745000	10749000	You know, we just do this because, you know, somebody brought this up before,
10749000	10752000	just kind of the whole talk about, like, you know, the family.
10752000	10755000	And that really is, you guys that are so enthusiastic about this show,
10755000	10761000	there may not be 10,000 of you, but even like the fact that there's five of you
10761000	10764000	makes like this so worth doing week in and week out.
10764000	10768000	And as we are coming up on episode 500 has really made it worth it
10768000	10771000	and why we've been stuck with it for so long.
10771000	10773000	We don't charge for the show.
10773000	10778000	We're not going to be asking you for twelve thousand dollars to do this here in person.
10778000	10780000	But I am every other week.
10780000	10782000	I am working on a gift for our listeners, though.
10782000	10783000	What's that?
10783000	10784000	We talked about it earlier.
10784000	10786000	Oh, yeah. She's not in a future way.
10786000	10790000	But I just wanted to say, fortunately, though, we have to raise the limit of friends.
10790000	10793000	You have to or the minimum of friends you have to ask.
10793000	10795000	You have to tell 500 of your friends.
10795000	10796000	That's right. That's right.
10796000	10798000	You're going to have to tell way more your friends.
10798000	10800000	We have conventions we want to go to.
10800000	10802000	We don't charge you guys to listen to this show.
10802000	10808000	I can tell you it does not take ten thousand dollars to put on this show.
10809000	10814000	It takes passion and dedication and wanting to do it for the loyal listeners.
10814000	10817000	And that is what we get out of it.
10817000	10820000	And so all we ask is help us grow our family.
10820000	10823000	Spread the word about the show. Tell a friend or two about it.
10823000	10826000	Give us a thumbs up on Stitcher.
10826000	10830000	And if you're on Tumblr, reblog when I freaking post it and not just hit like.
10830000	10833000	Jamie is just here for her tumbles and wanting more followers.
10833000	10834000	No, I'm not.
10834000	10839000	I've been I've figured since I've been using my Tumblr to promote the show.
10839000	10843000	I'm also using my Mass Effect Tumblr to promote the show.
10843000	10845000	So don't give me that, Rob. All right.
10845000	10847000	That does it. Thank you, guys.
10847000	10850000	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought for these two weeks.
10850000	10852000	And then we'll be back on April 7th.
10852000	10854000	Dark soccer. Your final thought tonight.
10854000	10856000	I have a headache. Stupid sinus infection.
10856000	10860000	Sorry. My final thought is hazelnut frappuccinos.
10860000	10862000	Pretty good. I'm going to go get one.
10862000	10864000	Pretty good. Is that Starbucks on the way?
10864000	10867000	Any of them. It's all I use the app.
10867000	10870000	The app will tell you when I have the app.
10870000	10873000	You can go for me. Get with the time.
10873000	10875000	Last but not least, it's a grind. Hello, Loki.
10875000	10879000	Your final thought. You know, I'm not a huge fan of these games.
10879000	10884000	It's really unfair that there's a Beatmania third mix final.
10884000	10890000	And I'm sorry, Beatmania three final and a keyboard third mix or keyboard
10890000	10893000	being a third mix in Sacramento.
10893000	10897000	They want one hundred dollars for both Rob.
10897000	10900000	Do you see what the price of Beatmania and you take the keyboard mania?
10900000	10903000	Where am I going to put a keyboard mania in this house? In my backyard.
10903000	10906000	If you if you can hold on to the other machine for me until we get a house,
10906000	10909000	then yes, I'll do it. I thought to Dan. All right.
10909000	10912000	But it's someone's already been on it. So on one of them.
10912000	10916000	So you got to outbid them. But I mean, the concept ninety nine dollars.
