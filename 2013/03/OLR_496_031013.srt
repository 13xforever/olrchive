00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:25,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, March 10th, 2013, one 10-year-old game is discovered hidden inside another, SimCity launches to connection errors in deleted cities, and could more chat functions be coming to the Wii U?

2
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:37,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:44,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 496 for this March 10th, 2013.

4
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:51,620
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,783
[SPEAKER_02]: First up, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:56,224
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

7
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:57,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a happy camper.

8
00:00:57,505 --> 00:00:58,766
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in a very good mood tonight.

9
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:00,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't possibly imagine why.

10
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,029
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no reason at all.

11
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:23,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I am still very sad.

12
00:01:23,757 --> 00:01:25,719
[SPEAKER_01]: It had no ice either, so it was all soda.

13
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:28,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever that was you got from Jack in the Box smelled very bacon-y.

14
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:30,183
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger.

15
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:31,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger, alright.

16
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:33,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart attack in a burger.

17
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,288
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a heart attack, please.

18
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:36,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, you're not going to have a heart attack from that.

19
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I considered, and I've been thinking about it, but it's just so much food.

20
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:48,273
[SPEAKER_01]: If I consider getting the hamburger from Lumberjacks that is the size of a cake.

21
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:54,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is a large... Is that that restaurant down on Howe with the giant... Lumberjack?

22
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:55,336
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horrible.

23
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,196
[SPEAKER_03]: It is horrible.

24
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:56,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been there before.

25
00:01:56,976 --> 00:02:00,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I remember when Lumberjacks was like a Home Depot type store.

26
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:02,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I just old?

27
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:03,558
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:25,974
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

29
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:52,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, say hello to our chatters.

30
00:02:52,225 --> 00:03:00,955
[SPEAKER_02]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

31
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:06,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And going to our chat room, a lot of chatters talking about Loki's dinner choice tonight.

32
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:11,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Tetsuya saying, like Loki would do the show without eating something with bacon on it.

33
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:14,917
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not true, the other, was it last week or the week before?

34
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:15,938
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't last week.

35
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:24,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, last week I had McNuggets from McDonald's, and the week before they had cheese pizza, so both of us have no bacon on them.

36
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:26,948
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very possible that I would do that.

37
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:30,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you get on a health kick, and I've seen you bring Subway in here.

38
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the only reason, no, I still like Subway.

39
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:42,715
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I didn't bring Subway is because, um, I tend to get it with onions on it and it just, it stinks for like three days.

40
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:44,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the amount of onions that I get.

41
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:50,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the way, like, my wife has ordered Subway for me before and she, here's how she explains it to them.

42
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:56,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the amount of onions that no human on earth would want on a sandwich and then, like, double that.

43
00:03:57,418 --> 00:03:59,939
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, when I order one for Dan, I tell him to make it noxious.

44
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:01,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.

45
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:03,107
[SPEAKER_01]: So they put a lot of onion on there.

46
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:05,587
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a lot of onion, a lot of garlic.

47
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:07,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So stinky stuff, I guess.

48
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Just no vampires near you.

49
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:11,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like infections or something.

50
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:12,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

51
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:13,369
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just... All right.

52
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not a food podcast, believe it or not.

53
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:16,910
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a video game podcast.

54
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:26,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into our gaming weeks and the types of things we've been playing tonight, I thought I would give a little plug to Bobby because his show's on before ours at the Voice of Geeks Network.

55
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:26,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I

56
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:27,272
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

57
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,400
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

58
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:14,586
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, she's a very, very prominent game actor.

59
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:23,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Bobby actually had her on the show tonight and was kind enough to name drop Jamie's Tumblr all about Mass Effect.

60
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:26,329
[SPEAKER_03]: It's masseffecting.tumblr.com.

61
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Plug, plug, plug, plug.

62
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can find the link to my other Tumblr there too, my main Tumblr.

63
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:36,977
[SPEAKER_02]: But lots of activity on the Mass Effect blogs everywhere this week because of the last DLC, sad face.

64
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:38,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

65
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:38,959
[SPEAKER_02]: That was on Tuesday.

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,321
[SPEAKER_03]: The wank has been enormous.

67
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:42,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

68
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:43,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So much wank.

69
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:50,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, yes, the Citadel DLC has been like everybody's fanfiction ever.

70
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:54,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was just a giant glob of fanfic, wasn't it?

71
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:56,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Except Tali's singing WTF.

72
00:05:57,395 --> 00:06:03,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was a whole... There's a reference where Tali... What was it?

73
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:08,351
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reference to a meme about what does her sweat taste like or something like that?

74
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:08,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

75
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:11,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a scene... Which, A, ew.

76
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:40,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done actually the rowdy party twice and I've done the calm hanging out party and Tali ends up hung over like piss drunk in the bathroom just saying all kinds of random things every time you click on her if you do the rowdy party it's grunt in the shower talking in his sleep quoting Scarface

77
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:43,646
[SPEAKER_03]: It is hilarious.

78
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,226
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

79
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:48,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess we're moving into our gaming weeks.

80
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:50,790
[SPEAKER_02]: All I really wanted to do at the top of the show was plug Bobby's interview.

81
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Bobby.

82
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

83
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:57,354
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so obviously Citadel, big deal for you and me being Mass Effect fans.

84
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:59,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I plopped my ass in that chair right over there.

85
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:02,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually coincidentally working from home that day.

86
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:06,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Not because of, I didn't do that because of games, but I had other stuff going on.

87
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:24,398
[SPEAKER_02]: so I had to just walk from the office to that chair at 4.30 I plopped there and I didn't leave until 10.30 after I'd beaten everything in that DLC I didn't do it multiple times but I played from start to finish and it was I kind of had a case of the feels oh I did it multiple times I bet you did

88
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a case of the feels.

89
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about you, but I was getting a little choked up.

90
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:29,821
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

91
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:36,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I managed to hold everything together until that one last part when it's very ended over.

92
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:38,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I lost my shit.

93
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:40,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I played it again that night.

94
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:44,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is funny because you and I are in the same boat.

95
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:46,788
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't even get into the series until a year ago.

96
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:49,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got other friends in the same boat.

97
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:49,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

98
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Becky wasn't even a gamer and she's a Thane shipper.

99
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:58,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there were feels.

100
00:07:59,072 --> 00:07:59,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet.

101
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:00,352
[SPEAKER_02]: There were feels.

102
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:01,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.

103
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:03,473
[SPEAKER_02]: They did that very well, by the way.

104
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even romance Thane.

105
00:08:06,734 --> 00:08:11,215
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time I watched the third video, I was like, that was so much fan service.

106
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:12,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I came.

107
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:12,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I came.

108
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:18,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Except like typical guides only once, so.

109
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:21,626
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

110
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:31,370
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've actually gone through on two playthroughs of the content with who I'm referring to as my head canon, FemShep.

111
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:39,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have my primary one who is basically rehashed off of my very, very first female shepherd, my redhead.

112
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:41,875
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone has looked at my blog, it's the redhead.

113
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:50,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a game file saved right after Horizon, right before you go beat Tim's ass.

114
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:54,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I got to do everything with that one.

115
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:56,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did the calmer party.

116
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I have now five save files at the Tango with Garrus.

117
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:01,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

118
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:05,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Which you totally don't get if you are BroShep and you didn't romance.

119
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:07,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like a totally different scene.

120
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:12,632
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I went back and watched the dude version of that one and I have to say BroShep is a pretty good wingman.

121
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:13,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

122
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:15,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor CluelessTorian.

123
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:17,356
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

124
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've heard that is not a pleasant scene to watch.

125
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:52,703
[SPEAKER_03]: That made me feel incredibly uncomfortable.

126
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:55,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say gross or dirty or anything.

127
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:55,946
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fandom wanted it.

128
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:57,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

129
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:59,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the shippers don't really care for it.

130
00:09:59,649 --> 00:09:59,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.

131
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:07,606
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's what, you know, it was, it just seemed, a lot of it, there was some, you know, out of character stuff.

132
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:08,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was really funny.

133
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:09,447
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done the right way.

134
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:12,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in character, but fourth wall breaking kind of thing.

135
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,310
[SPEAKER_03]: That just didn't seem in character to me.

136
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,611
[SPEAKER_01]: What is happening to this show?

137
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, what is happening to this show?

138
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:20,873
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

139
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:48,874
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we've got this thing called E3 and you guys have been at the end of this brand new Mass Effect.

140
00:10:49,254 --> 00:10:54,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to have all the characters that they've been so emotionally attached to.

141
00:10:54,758 --> 00:11:04,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I already said I am dying to go to E3 and be at EA's press conference so I can break down sighing uncontrollably when they unveil a Mass Effect 4 and Bobby will have to hug me.

142
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:09,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've already said their... Whatever.

143
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:10,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatevs.

144
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,810
[SPEAKER_03]: W hands.

145
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatevs.

146
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:15,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you what's happening to this show.

147
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:19,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamer Girl in chat says, Thanks to DarkSakura, I am a Mass Effect whore.

148
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:19,717
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL.

149
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:20,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

150
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:21,879
[SPEAKER_03]: One of us.

151
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one indoctrinated.

152
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you are in my cult of... Never.

153
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:27,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I will never play Mass Effect.

154
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:29,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Join the cult of Shepard.

155
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:30,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, Rob?

156
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:31,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

157
00:11:32,744 --> 00:11:33,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

158
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:38,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask a serious question that dives into the anti-Mass Effect-ing a little bit, okay?

159
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:39,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuckballs.

160
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:50,114
[SPEAKER_02]: People didn't like the ending to Mass Effect 3, the large and whole, so I don't see the DLC as a substitute ending, but it is certainly an ending.

161
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:53,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this make up for the lackluster original ending?

162
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:55,119
[SPEAKER_02]: or even Extended Cut.

163
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, remember, I went back and had to watch the original ending after I watched Extended Cut.

164
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:03,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, I still hate the synthesis ending because it's all fucking space magic.

165
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:04,545
[SPEAKER_03]: But, anyway.

166
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:05,486
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I...

167
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:15,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got into discussions about this with a couple of people.

168
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: An apology isn't really a good word for it.

169
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:24,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of a, you know what, thank you for sticking with us.

170
00:12:24,908 --> 00:12:26,549
[SPEAKER_03]: We know we might have screwed up here and there.

171
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,331
[SPEAKER_03]: We know it wasn't quite what you wanted it to be.

172
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:58,076
[SPEAKER_03]: and and I'm actually gonna disagree that I didn't really care for all of the writing in three I mean it seemed like a pretty natural progression from two but I didn't really care for the plot in two it was a great game don't get me wrong it just I didn't care for I didn't care for the whole elusive man bit I thought that was just a pain but um I think it was more of an acknowledgement it was it was a little bit of yeah we've been paying attention here you go

173
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:25,036
[SPEAKER_02]: for me it was a send off it was very much the made for TV movie that comes out like two years after the series ended you know it was kind of like the whole let's do let's do one more hurrah let's have the cast of Facts of Life go to Australia for one last hurrah and they get into let's have Blair and Tootie get into a relationship we just need to hang out with Blair and Joe and Tootie it would be shipping Blair and Tootie laughing

174
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that on the back of the box.

175
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:32,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect 3 Citadel DLC.

176
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like shipping Blair and Tootie.

177
00:13:34,803 --> 00:13:39,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Alan, if I was going to romance Cortez, then I'd have to play a dude.

178
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:41,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not feeling it.

179
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:42,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, boy.

180
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:45,375
[SPEAKER_03]: But going back into it, I...

181
00:13:46,736 --> 00:14:14,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed the content I actually enjoyed it more than Omega and really the things I liked about Omega was I liked Nireen's character and I just thought it was cool seeing Arya be a huge bitch and then oh god Rob you're not even okay Leviathan was okay I really more liked just the space waifu parts of that hold on I need some background music for while you're talking about all of this here hold on I'm gonna give you some background music I'm gonna smack a bitch

182
00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:20,637
[SPEAKER_04]: You take the good, you take the bad You take them both and there you have the bad

183
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:24,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is kind of the story about Mass Effect.

184
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,863
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and there you have it.

185
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:30,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And you ship everybody.

186
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:36,027
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a comment on Tumblr where someone said Mass Effect, where all relationships are canon.

187
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And Charlotte Rae does kind of look like an Asari a little bit.

188
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:40,871
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

189
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:42,332
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

190
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:43,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

191
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:48,656
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, this is probably the most fun I've had in the game.

192
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:52,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... There's a lot of cool extra stuff like the arena is actually a lot of fun.

193
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting to have Kasumi in my party again gives me life.

194
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find the secret box in the casino?

195
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so, no.

196
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:01,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to tell you how to... Everyone listen up.

197
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:03,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Story time with Auntie Jamie.

198
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:15,076
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go up the stairs from the bottom floor, and you have the bar that's to your right, that sort of semi-circular bar, go to the end of it, closest to the back wall.

199
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:16,896
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little device down there.

200
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:18,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on that one, Kasumi pops up.

201
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't find that thing.

202
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:21,098
[SPEAKER_02]: It's upstairs?

203
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:23,638
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the middle level, technically.

204
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,139
[SPEAKER_03]: The ground level is the flight of stairs leading into the casino.

205
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

206
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,120
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it didn't show up in the mid-level for me.

207
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked everywhere for it.

208
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:35,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran over the place and I actually found it by complete accident, but I can tell you exactly where it is.

209
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:39,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Shane and I were having discussions on this because I never got the bonus Kasumi scene.

210
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:48,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I'm actually going to go back through with my Renegon, my real bitch of a character, and try to do the whole content as a Renegade, just for fun.

211
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:48,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for fun.

212
00:15:48,855 --> 00:15:49,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for fun.

213
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:49,775
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

214
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,876
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that aren't into Mass Effect are falling asleep.

215
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:53,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I played other things.

216
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:53,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

217
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:54,157
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

218
00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:55,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about, shut up.

219
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:56,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I played something else.

220
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the rest of your gaming week then.

221
00:15:58,118 --> 00:15:58,338
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

222
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,199
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week besides Mass Effect?

223
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:03,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought we were already talking about my gaming week because that was really my week.

224
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:30,669
[SPEAKER_03]: That and Fun Employment, of course But I played a little bit more of To The Moon I put it aside because DLC after DLC kept coming out I really like the game To The Moon It's basically just a story that you click and pick up some things and that's about it I don't really think there's any way to play the game badly But it has such a sweet story that I've really been enjoying it I'm going back and playing it quite a bit

225
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:37,932
[SPEAKER_03]: and I started on the last Tomb Raider game, The Guardian of Light, since one of our listeners was kind enough to get it for me.

226
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:38,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.

227
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:40,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get very far.

228
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:42,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Guardian of Light's kind of more of a side story.

229
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:47,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not... Yeah, and I wanted to check it out, you know, so... It's a good game.

230
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:48,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

231
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:58,935
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, really, the other thing that I actually did for Mass Effect type stuff was, not playing the game, I have learned how to mod Xbox files.

232
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:07,779
[SPEAKER_03]: And then how to copy, we finally got it to work, how to get original PC save files into a temp file so that they will load on the Xbox.

233
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,259
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting into the hacking a little bit.

234
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,300
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of the hacking.

235
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Creeping up on Loki's turf.

236
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,421
[SPEAKER_02]: But... Only this is a game he'd never touch.

237
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:38,577
[SPEAKER_03]: all my stuff I mean basically they are legitimately played games I got to where I did well I cheated a little bit but I mean I was able to recreate and save them and I've been able to reload head morphs on to basically you know how I have like my shepherds typically have NPC hair and different skin textures things that are in the game that all I've done is unlock them with the gibbed editor and

238
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:47,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've managed to get head morphs saved from Xbox, get them to work on PC, and get my PC head morphs working on the Xbox so that the hacked data will show up.

239
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:51,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, Becky got my Shepard to work, my redhead.

240
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:51,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

241
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:55,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I will link a picture in the chat room so you can see exactly how modded she is.

242
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:56,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

243
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:57,629
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I've been doing.

244
00:17:58,169 --> 00:17:58,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

245
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, I know you're dying to talk about a different game, so how was your gaming week?

246
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:03,853
[SPEAKER_01]: My game week is alright.

247
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:05,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play a whole ton of things.

248
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:06,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I did.

249
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

250
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:09,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff I've been playing.

251
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:16,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Far Cry 2, I've been still trying to recreate the part of the map that we used to play the multiplayer map from Grand Theft Auto 4.

252
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:20,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I'm not sure if I'm actually going to be able to do it now because I'm running out of objects.

253
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used about a quarter of them already and I still have to duplicate the whole building over to another spot and then

254
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:29,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Build another one.

255
00:18:29,544 --> 00:18:31,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to run out of objects before I get the map done.

256
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:36,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be a whole lot of wasted time for nothing.

257
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:38,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pimping it last week.

258
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,031
[SPEAKER_01]: The Free Bundle.

259
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:43,233
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go online to freebundle.com and download free games.

260
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:46,315
[SPEAKER_01]: They put out a new set of games each week or so.

261
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:47,936
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually had a new set.

262
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,398
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the games in it was called Zenith.

263
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:55,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Zenith is kind of a weird game, but it's fun.

264
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,903
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me a lot of Jet Grind Radio.

265
00:18:58,563 --> 00:19:06,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically this, looks like this character is wearing a cowboy hat and some sort of mech suit thing, but you skate along the ground, you can grind on the walls and all sorts of stuff.

266
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:14,816
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has like the story that goes along with it, but it's just a fun game and very trippy, very stylized look to it.

267
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:20,041
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a lot of fun, and it also uses the Xbox 360 controller on the PC, so...

268
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:25,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely go check that out if you can, because it's free, so that's the best price.

269
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:34,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of stuff that's on PC, I happened to... There was one of those... It wasn't the Humble Bundle, but it was...

270
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:39,488
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those other ones, I actually pimped it out on Twitter earlier this week.

271
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:43,593
[SPEAKER_01]: They had Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon as one of the games you can unlock.

272
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:44,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got that for five bucks.

273
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:45,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

274
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:52,864
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though I've already beaten it on the console, I figured I'd try it on PC again.

275
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:53,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

276
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:54,837
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.

277
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:59,099
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually modded the game to unlock the frame rate from 30 to 60.

278
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,261
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some field of view mods you can do to it, so that's kind of fun.

279
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:13,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, we're starting to start a co-op game on the Xbox for Borderlands.

280
00:20:13,604 --> 00:20:20,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wanted to do Borderlands 2 but that DLC just fucked up all of our games so I can't really start that again.

281
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:28,696
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to start Saints Row the 3rd again and do co-op through that so hopefully I can get the rest of my achievements by finishing some of the missions in different ways and stuff.

282
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:36,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And Call of Duty, I made a record on one of my deathmatch games, 62 kills in 10 minutes.

283
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:38,442
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impressive.

284
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:39,584
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of murder.

285
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:40,765
[SPEAKER_01]: It was ridiculous.

286
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,509
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like my fun house of carnage.

287
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:46,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I had so many perks up at one time.

288
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:50,139
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not fun for them.

289
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,882
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much it.

290
00:20:52,082 --> 00:20:53,404
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I kind of played this week.

291
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:01,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Jamie talks about Mass Effect, Loki talks about Grand Theft Auto, what will Rob talk about?

292
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:01,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

293
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:03,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny you should mention that.

294
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:05,583
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a new patch in World of Warcraft this week, 5.2.

295
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:06,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

296
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:16,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, most of the talk is on my other show, Plug Plug, Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, Plug Plug, live Wednesday nights at VOG Network, Plug Plug.

297
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:19,528
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll just quickly say, yes, I explored the new patch.

298
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:30,476
[SPEAKER_02]: A big part of the patch is that there's a new island, lots more dailies to do, which I know a lot of the fandom has collectively eye-rolled at how much this expansion is relying on dailies.

299
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:34,178
[SPEAKER_02]: But these really aren't so bad, except for the fact that it's super crowded.

300
00:21:34,538 --> 00:21:36,820
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best way to do dailies, group up with friends.

301
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:45,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So most every weeknight, like later at night, 10, 11, myself, Alan, Shane, and Evan, who's in our Horde House guild for the other show,

302
00:21:46,026 --> 00:22:13,509
[SPEAKER_02]: uh we've been grouping up to do dailies every night and it's it's so much easier that way and just kind of looking at the new content lots of little fan servicey things much easier to get elder charms and spirits of harmony and there's this treasure room now so like you can get a key and you go on this quest to go in a solo scenario so it's actually a legit solo instance and it's a treasure room and it's just there's all these traps everywhere but you have five minutes to grab as much treasure as you can

303
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's that part from that video game show that I liked.

304
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:17,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you had the Velcro vest?

305
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:20,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they like turned that into a scenario in WoW.

306
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:21,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I have to play again.

307
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Is leveling any faster?

308
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, they didn't reduce the XP or anything.

309
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:29,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there might be new heirlooms, I could be wrong though.

310
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:57,122
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's so stolen also from Borderlands the secret armory of General Nox same situation well you know what Warcraft is really great at taking a lot of pop culture stuff and kind of implementing it in their game I mean you know it's part of what's made the game last as long as it has so that's all I'll say about World of Warcraft but yes I've been enjoying the new patch probably won't get to enjoy the new raid though I hear it's pretty tough so we'll see when the LFR version opens up next week

311
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Other games I've been playing.

312
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:02,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Talked about Mass Effect Citadel already.

313
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:09,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going to go back to that territory, but I will say, you know, plot myself down on the couch, played it start to finish.

314
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:15,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the last time a video game kind of just, like, commanded my attention like that.

315
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:18,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I know Mass Effect has its haters.

316
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:20,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can leave!

317
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:21,097
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

318
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:35,320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can stay, but just realize that, you know, Shane and I were talking about it, you know, after we'd both beaten it, and he said, you know, yes, I can replay the DLC over and over again because it's a lot like Battlestar Galactica, which I can watch over and over again.

319
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,381
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I think that's a decent comparison.

320
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:42,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, the Mass Effect plot is a really good sci-fi show, like Battlestar Galactica.

321
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:44,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But even that show has its haters, too, so whatever.

322
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:45,743
[SPEAKER_03]: The wank, Rob, the wank.

323
00:23:45,823 --> 00:23:46,083
[SPEAKER_02]: The wank.

324
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:47,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Other stuff.

325
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:48,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Brand new game.

326
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:50,284
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a busy week for games.

327
00:23:50,444 --> 00:23:55,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even touch SimCity, which is the game everybody's talking about this week, and I don't think any of us did.

328
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm smart.

329
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:59,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't care.

330
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:03,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really played a SimCity game since... I didn't even like SimCity 2000, to be honest.

331
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:08,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Super Nintendo one, and the original one on PC was awesome.

332
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:14,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always joke about the CD-ROM remake, but, you know, I never really got into the future SimCity games.

333
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:17,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, four, I didn't really care for them.

334
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:30,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they said there was a new one and it was going to rely on your friend's input, all this hubba-ba-ba about DRM aside, which I know is a story coming up later on we'll get into, but all that crap aside, it's like, I just wasn't interested in the game.

335
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,443
[SPEAKER_02]: is that so wrong?

336
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's just a game I didn't seem interested in?

337
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:39,246
[SPEAKER_02]: when these things cost 60 bucks a pop?

338
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:43,588
[SPEAKER_02]: it's okay, I didn't care either alright, so you know what I did spend my 60 dollars on?

339
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:52,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomb Raider which in some ways was a leap of faith because, real talk Tomb Raider series, last few games little stale, right?

340
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:54,054
[SPEAKER_01]: last few games, all have been reboots

341
00:24:55,134 --> 00:25:01,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they really have rebooted Tomb Raider, and honestly, it's the kick in the ass the series needed.

342
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:06,189
[SPEAKER_02]: It's intense.

343
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:11,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've brought up this movie on OLR before, but it's the best comparison I can honestly think of.

344
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,156
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

345
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:46,749
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it is a tense movie, and the entire side, it's like, you are just sitting on the edge of your seat going, and like, at the end of the movie, you just have to unclench.

346
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:48,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, seriously, it's like that tense.

347
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:58,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Tomb Raider is a lot like that, because like, right from the get-go, I mean, you've all seen the little cutscene that the game starts with, the same thing they showed at E3, but then it's like,

348
00:25:58,915 --> 00:26:13,592
[SPEAKER_02]: it don't stop it's like it's a cave-in and now there's people down this island that are chasing you and now like you you start to just feel bad for Laura Croft because bad things won't stop happening to her and do

349
00:26:13,592 --> 00:26:18,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the early, early leaks about Tomb Raider said it was a survival horror?

350
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:24,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember they leaked several years ago that this was happening, that Tomb Raider was getting rebooted and it was going to be a survival horror game?

351
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember that.

352
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:34,806
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people kind of lost the survival horror thing, but there's a lot in common with like a lot of like jump scares, oh shit moments, like...

353
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:59,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm walking along the path, da-da-da, I've got to get to this, I've got to get to this radio tower so I can be in the transmission, I've got to go, I've got to go, I'm running, I'm running, and fuck, I'm in a spring trap, and, like, now I'm hanging upside down, having to kill guards, like, it's just, like, it's, like, non-stop, like, stuff like that, so, um, and on top of that, the game is kind of like a, one of my friends said it was, like, Metroidvania type of, and I was like, really?

354
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:01,550
[SPEAKER_02]: But the more I played it, I'm like, it

355
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,210
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

356
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:30,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Link's Grappling Hook

357
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:59,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say maybe the only reservation some people may have is that I'm a third of the way through the game and I've only been playing for about four hours, maybe four and a half.

358
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:05,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So the single player campaign appears to be 12 hours, maybe 15 hours tops if you're very meticulous about everything.

359
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:09,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of for a $60 game, take that with a grain of salt.

360
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:10,296
[SPEAKER_02]: But

361
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:17,120
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a very doesn't let up 15 hours.

362
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,823
[SPEAKER_02]: The tomb raiding is optional, which I know has said a lot of people's kind of been giving them a question mark.

363
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:26,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, what the hell is a Tomb Raider game where you're not actually raiding tombs?

364
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:53,931
[SPEAKER_02]: well here's the deal there's these hidden tombs that you'll find and you can go inside and it's basically a giant puzzle and if you solve the puzzle you get a treasure chest at the end that will not only give you like maybe an upgrade for your bow or you know something like that but it will also reveal random things on your main map that you may have missed like you missed this relic here you missed this document here and da da da da so yes the tomb raiding is optional but if you're going to go for 100 completion rate

365
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:57,493
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff's going to go a very long way in doing so.

366
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:00,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I haven't even touched multiplayer.

367
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:06,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't heard good things about it, but I want to refrain from making further comment until I've actually had a chance to try it myself.

368
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:09,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't want to play with strangers.

369
00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:11,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to try to get some VOG people.

370
00:29:11,844 --> 00:29:12,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody got Tomb Raider for 360?

371
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:16,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we need to have a night on Tomb Raider pretty soon.

372
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,190
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did I want to say about Tomb Raider?

373
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,912
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another negative thing I had to say.

374
00:29:21,212 --> 00:29:22,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here's the negative.

375
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:28,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to find whoever invented the shaky cam technique and punch them in the face.

376
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:33,314
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of shaky cam, especially in the beginning of the game.

377
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:39,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lessened itself a little bit now that we're a little ways in the game, but the very beginning of the game had a lot of shaky cam.

378
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:48,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't usually get sick playing video games, but I had to close my eyes and look down and listen and be like, fucking stop with the shaky cam.

379
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:49,076
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

380
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:33,068
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know I can always look away it didn't detract from the game as a whole but I did want to kind of just point that out like stop stop shaky cam stop it Dungeon Buster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says thanks a lot Blair Witch that's from Dungeon Buster Degenerate Johnny says shaky cam equals JJ Abrams yeah thanks a lot JJ Abrams

381
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:36,392
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says, Rob, any lens flares?

382
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:37,894
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not that I've seen.

383
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:41,698
[SPEAKER_01]: You do get a torch.

384
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it wasn't Michael Bay.

385
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:45,483
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the guy that did Gladiator.

386
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:47,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Gladiator was very shaky cam too.

387
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:49,328
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of got popular after that.

388
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:55,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Ragenator in chat says, there's one thing missing from Tomb Raider games, a full-on lesbian scene.

389
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:57,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you silly boys.

390
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Tigerclaw says, I hear you can play the entire game using just the bow.

391
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypothetically, I guess you could.

392
00:31:06,543 --> 00:31:08,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more fun to use the machine gun, but okay.

393
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:10,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Play however you want.

394
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:36,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon Buster also says it's a torrent of bad news that never ends for Croft in the reboot it's great yeah you know all these things you were hearing about in the preamp about how you will see how Laura Croft had to toughen up and all this it's like yeah yeah I can see it I can definitely see it all right anyhow that's enough that's all I want to say about Tomb Raider for now I'll let you know more when I actually beat the game let's get to housekeeping tonight

395
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:52,936
[SPEAKER_02]: follow us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR and you can also follow us on Facebook facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and we're on Google Plus I don't think we have anything else really big coming up show wise I should go ahead I was going to do this at the end of the show but I'll plug it now

396
00:31:53,516 --> 00:31:54,357
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

397
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:10,655
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

398
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:34,333
[SPEAKER_02]: for Seg's project.

399
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:40,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk to Seg about starting a gaming studio and what his whole vision is and all that.

400
00:32:40,995 --> 00:32:43,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll talk to him next week about that.

401
00:32:43,356 --> 00:32:44,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking forward to having him.

402
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:47,958
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have heard me yell at my computer.

403
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:49,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

404
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:54,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I would get like one thing perfect and it was missing something.

405
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:57,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would go back and try to retweak it and lose everything I did.

406
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:58,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was awful.

407
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:00,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would scream obscenities.

408
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:03,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but you worked your way through it.

409
00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:08,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll interview Seg about any obscenities he may or may not have yelled.

410
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:10,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't yell any at him because he's nice.

411
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:11,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

412
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:12,356
[SPEAKER_02]: He is very nice.

413
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:15,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyhow, let's get into gaming news then.

414
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,703
[SPEAKER_02]: We will start off with Loki with what's going on in gaming news this week.

415
00:33:20,086 --> 00:33:24,308
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of stuff coming out about Steam Box.

416
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:27,790
[SPEAKER_01]: They were showing some of those piston computers and stuff.

417
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, $1,000 for that thing.

418
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:31,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, not going to buy it.

419
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:46,839
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the Xi3 is one of the first Steam Box computers or third-party Steam Boxes, not necessarily something made by Steam or Valve, but it's to spec, I guess.

420
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:56,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but $1,000, man, for something that's just a really small form factor, I would just spend probably less than that and make something even better spec-wise.

421
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And who cares if it takes up a little extra space?

422
00:33:58,992 --> 00:34:02,536
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, full tower, you can put it inside of a TV stand, you'll never notice it.

423
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:09,383
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that they're saying they could do is that the Steam Box could actually expand the PC landscape.

424
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:14,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is according to the hardware manufacturer MSI.

425
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:19,493
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a lot of third-party graphics cards and motherboards.

426
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

427
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:37,122
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of agree with that.

428
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:37,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kind of...

429
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:56,906
[SPEAKER_01]: and many more.

430
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:29,316
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing that kind of holds a lot of people back, I guess, from buying a PC to game on is because, oh, hey, cool, I've got this awesome PC I spent a lot of money on.

431
00:35:29,456 --> 00:35:33,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, crap, now I've got to buy another $300 graphics card.

432
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, now I've got to buy some more RAM.

433
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I need to upgrade my processor.

434
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:39,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the upgrade my processor, I've got to upgrade my motherboard.

435
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,126
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I've got to buy another graphics card.

436
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:44,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that also just randomly go with a regular PC anyway?

437
00:35:46,198 --> 00:35:46,899
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.

438
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:48,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking PC in general.

439
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not necessarily saying Steam boxes.

440
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that, you know, that's what holds people back a lot of times.

441
00:35:53,183 --> 00:36:06,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think originally with the Steam box, it was kind of this, okay, listen, we're going to put out this thing that's going to cost an X amount of money and it's going to be able to run everything on, you know, Steam or, you know, whatever these games are going to be.

442
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:13,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they're saying that Valve is actually going to be sharing some of the Steam Box prototypes within the next few months.

443
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:23,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether they're going to be giving them to customers or developers or whatever, but I guess they're going to be out there in the next few months, so we'll hopefully get to see some of those prototypes.

444
00:36:24,522 --> 00:36:31,627
[SPEAKER_01]: and, hey, if you happen to be interested in the piston, you can get $100 off of it right now.

445
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,127
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, $100.

446
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:35,289
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll run you, what, $999?

447
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:39,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

448
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:48,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you can get an extra 128 gig solid state drive for... Or I guess you upgrade the 128 gig solid state drive to 512 gigs for $750.

449
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:50,144
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really, really nice.

450
00:36:56,212 --> 00:37:06,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, seriously, if you're going to make a PC that's going to run on your TV, just build a PC because all graphics cards nowadays, they output the HDMI, just shove it next to your TV, done.

451
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:09,987
[SPEAKER_01]: No need to pay extra money for this really small PC.

452
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:14,572
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a computer hooked up to our TV for the past seven years.

453
00:37:16,093 --> 00:37:16,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

454
00:37:18,638 --> 00:37:23,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, we are going to switch gears here a little bit before we get into the next story.

455
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:32,647
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Orange Lawns Radio, it is the show where every gamer has a voice, and many of these voices are going to be coming together at PAX East next week.

456
00:37:33,347 --> 00:37:34,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it next weekend?

457
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:37,109
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's in two weeks.

458
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.

459
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon.

460
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon.

461
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:42,392
[SPEAKER_02]: The very gaming term of soon.

462
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:43,933
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the wrong coast.

463
00:37:43,993 --> 00:37:44,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I was going.

464
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:47,974
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have one of the folks that's going to be at PAX East.

465
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:49,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to bring on to the show.

466
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:50,616
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somebody kind of special.

467
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:58,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody well known, not just for her cosplay, but for a very cool achievement of sorts when it comes to the Omegathon with PAX.

468
00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:01,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to give our buddy, and this is one of Ranma's buddies.

469
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very excited he let us have her on the show.

470
00:38:04,664 --> 00:38:06,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy from Anime Jam Session, plug, plug, Tuesday nights.

471
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,988
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Pork Buns, but we can call her Tina.

472
00:38:10,508 --> 00:38:16,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to get her on the line right now and talk a little bit about PAX East and what's going on.

473
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:17,834
[SPEAKER_03]: She sounds delicious.

474
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:18,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Tina, you there?

475
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I am, and I heard that bit about me being delicious.

476
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, pork buns are delicious, magically delicious.

477
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:26,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they are.

478
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, welcome to the show, Tina.

479
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:28,204
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

480
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:29,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing all right.

481
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:35,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I am slightly exhausted from sculpting for eight hours, but I think I'll be fine.

482
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,468
[SPEAKER_05]: What exactly are you sculpting?

483
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:47,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I am sculpting the mask for Corvo from Dishonored, and I'm doing a clay sculpt of it before I do a mold of it and then cast it.

484
00:38:47,954 --> 00:39:00,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, my understanding is that, and you'll have to excuse me, I'm on the wrong coast, so I don't get to a lot of cons on the East Coast, but my understanding is you do some real bang-up awesome cosplay at a lot of the East Coast cons.

485
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:04,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there some characters that you've done that folks may recognize you as, our East Coast listeners?

486
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:12,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, um, I think most people know me as the Amon from Legend of Korra.

487
00:39:12,122 --> 00:39:14,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's been, um, passed around a lot.

488
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:21,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've also done the Journey cosplay from the PSN, the PSN indie hit.

489
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:22,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, of course.

490
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:22,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've done that.

491
00:39:23,046 --> 00:39:26,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've also designed a tutorial so people might know me from that too.

492
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:28,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, basically no one sees my face.

493
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:28,808
Yeah.

494
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:32,755
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see your face on Skype right now.

495
00:39:32,795 --> 00:39:33,556
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty face.

496
00:39:33,596 --> 00:39:34,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You should show it.

497
00:39:34,517 --> 00:39:34,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

498
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Journey on PlayStation Network, am I right?

499
00:39:39,163 --> 00:39:42,047
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually got complimented on this by some important people, right?

500
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:45,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we got a feature done.

501
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:50,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and my friends, Chris, Morgan, Kate, and Nicole, we got featured on Kotaku.

502
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:55,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've also gotten some attention from the company that made it, which is That Game Company.

503
00:39:56,157 --> 00:40:01,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the Grammy-nominated composer, Austin Wintory.

504
00:40:02,242 --> 00:40:04,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got some buzz for that, which was really nice.

505
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:08,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, absolutely, and it's even better when no one can see my face.

506
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:34,010
[SPEAKER_05]: All my popular cosplays, so-called popular cosplays, no one ever sees my face.

507
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a trademark thing?

508
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:37,633
[SPEAKER_02]: You sound very proud of that, that nobody sees your face.

509
00:40:37,653 --> 00:40:44,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, I do, because I feel like I take away that control for someone to judge how good I look.

510
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just like, well, you can't judge because there's something covering my face.

511
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:49,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm forced you to look at my craftsmanship.

512
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:53,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I have a friend who has a and had an excellent costume.

513
00:40:54,479 --> 00:41:02,205
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was go as a larva at AX for a few years in a row and had an excellent costume.

514
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:04,687
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was from a Vampire Princess Miu.

515
00:41:04,707 --> 00:41:05,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've seen it, Rob.

516
00:41:05,968 --> 00:41:06,148
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

517
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:06,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

518
00:41:06,568 --> 00:41:15,835
[SPEAKER_03]: But but yeah, she used to do a larva costume just for the sake of showing off the good costume and not having to, you know, with the mask and everything.

519
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:17,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

520
00:41:17,313 --> 00:41:28,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I feel like when you have your face out there, people tend to look at whether you look similar to the character, whether you're good looking, whether you're bad looking, if there's any kind of flaws in your face.

521
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:31,260
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just take that control from people when I have a masked costume.

522
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,021
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why it's my favorite thing to do.

523
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:36,943
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very powerful way of looking at it.

524
00:41:36,983 --> 00:41:41,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of like... Throw it the opposite way with my bike and costume a few years ago.

525
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:42,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed off my racks so no one would look at my face.

526
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:44,166
Yeah.

527
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:45,212
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

528
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:17,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Chicks, and, you know, Dressed as Mai, and Chun-Li Not that there's anything wrong with that, you know, those are great characters and so forth But, you know, when you focus on that, like, that's not cool, right?

529
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:38,788
[SPEAKER_05]: well to each their own and you know for people who can show off their body and they're comfortable with that that's fantastic really really fantastic for them I'm just not that kind of person and I like to be as kind of float by and have people just recognize me for my craftsmanship because that's what I really care about so

530
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:43,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to show off my body either, and the internet is very thankful for that.

531
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So are the rest of us, Rob.

532
00:42:46,985 --> 00:42:48,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually checked out some of your costumes.

533
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:50,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that your work is impeccable.

534
00:42:50,626 --> 00:42:52,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I wanted to ask you about something.

535
00:42:52,346 --> 00:42:55,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen that material that they put out that's in the jar?

536
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:56,207
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that stuff called?

537
00:42:56,827 --> 00:43:02,508
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like $10, and it's supposed to be not like Sculpey, but you pour it in the mold and you'll bake it.

538
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:04,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's supposed to be really inexpensive.

539
00:43:05,108 --> 00:43:07,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually wondering if you had an opinion about that or if you've ever used it.

540
00:43:08,149 --> 00:43:09,270
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

541
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:58,775
[SPEAKER_05]: for example like Wonderflex or the new popular material right now, Worbla and put paper clay on top of it which is basically very very fine paper mache but for this mask that I'm making what I'm doing is I'm actually taking a modeling clay so it never dries and I'm probably going to do a brush on rubber silicone mode and I'm going to cast it out of I believe it's a resin, I'm not exactly sure it's called smooth cast and

542
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:01,876
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really lightweight, very, very durable material.

543
00:44:01,936 --> 00:44:03,437
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really hard to sand, though.

544
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:05,098
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not looking forward to that.

545
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:11,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done cons in quite a while, but I've told you this before, Rob.

546
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually planning on doing a Shepard cosplay myself.

547
00:44:13,922 --> 00:44:15,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my.

548
00:44:15,942 --> 00:44:18,944
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have a friend who is a ceramic sculptor.

549
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:20,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

550
00:44:20,064 --> 00:44:23,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was actually going to have her make my helmet and part of the ceramic.

551
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:25,481
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually pretty good, yeah.

552
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:27,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a Mass Effect fan, Tina?

553
00:44:27,442 --> 00:44:28,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a huge Mass Effect fan.

554
00:44:28,902 --> 00:44:29,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're good.

555
00:44:29,442 --> 00:44:30,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that, Loki.

556
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you on Tumblr?

557
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one.

558
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:33,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I am on Tumblr, yes.

559
00:44:34,443 --> 00:44:35,364
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to talk later.

560
00:44:35,404 --> 00:44:38,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Your Mass Effect fans do nothing for me.

561
00:44:38,304 --> 00:44:38,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

562
00:44:38,985 --> 00:44:39,665
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Tina?

563
00:44:39,705 --> 00:44:46,826
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the reason we were running late tonight is the guy before us here at VOG Network tonight had an interview with Jennifer Hale and we couldn't shut up about it.

564
00:44:47,207 --> 00:44:48,367
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we were running late.

565
00:44:48,427 --> 00:44:50,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some serious... Jennifer Hale loves Fangirl Link.

566
00:44:50,447 --> 00:44:51,168
[SPEAKER_05]: That's understandable.

567
00:44:53,789 --> 00:44:54,029
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

568
00:44:54,389 --> 00:45:06,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Tina, something else I want to talk to you about, which I'm sure we definitely have our listeners that are into cosplay and so forth, but there might be some that don't follow that as much, but they're certainly following what's going on at the various conventions.

569
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:15,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have quite a few people and listeners that are going to be at PAX East who are going to get to see you participate in this year's Omegathon, right?

570
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:15,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

571
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:21,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Tina is the runner-up of last year's Omegathon, and if I am not mistaken, I have heard that you are the first female to make the finals.

572
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:40,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that is untrue.

573
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:45,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I am only the second female to make Omegathon.

574
00:45:45,806 --> 00:45:50,710
[SPEAKER_05]: The record was broken by Cassandra Leis two years ago.

575
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,531
[SPEAKER_05]: So she made it to the finals too.

576
00:45:53,112 --> 00:45:54,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was only the second one to make it.

577
00:45:54,973 --> 00:45:58,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was another female that made it to the finals for this Prime.

578
00:45:58,596 --> 00:46:00,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe she was the first one for Prime.

579
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:04,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody lied to me, but you know what?

580
00:46:04,374 --> 00:46:07,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It still does not lessen the girl power any.

581
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:11,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That's three PAXs in a row, so congratulations, right?

582
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

583
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:18,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was the game that unfortunately knocked you out of contention last year?

584
00:46:18,785 --> 00:46:19,265
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

585
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:28,337
[SPEAKER_05]: This game called Crokinole, it's a Canadian game, and the best way I can describe it is like hand curling.

586
00:46:28,897 --> 00:46:31,118
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like curling, but you're using your fingers instead.

587
00:46:32,018 --> 00:46:46,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happened was, we were head to head for a while, and unfortunately, my partner, Michael Tolan, he had done one shot that gave them 30 points off the bat, and they won it, and we were like, oh, well, that's what happens.

588
00:46:47,082 --> 00:46:48,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't play a game, like, ever.

589
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:53,167
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your reaction when the game was unveiled?

590
00:46:53,207 --> 00:46:56,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's always a mystery what the big last game is going to be at the Omegathon.

591
00:46:57,211 --> 00:47:00,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always unveiled right at the last minute while you're there on stage.

592
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:04,019
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your reaction when they showed, oh, it's this obscure Canadian.

593
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:05,641
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even a freaking video game.

594
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,020
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it isn't.

595
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:14,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, before, what they did was they teased us beforehand by playing the Canadian National Anthem, which they had Jonathan Coulton sing.

596
00:47:16,185 --> 00:47:16,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I love him.

597
00:47:17,786 --> 00:47:18,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I love him too.

598
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:22,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were watching it, and we were just like, oh crap, what the hell is it?

599
00:47:22,948 --> 00:47:26,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they revealed it, I think we all looked at each other and was like, what the F?

600
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:34,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we were all dressed up really mobile, just in case it was a mobile game or something, and we were all like...

601
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:36,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

602
00:47:55,703 --> 00:47:59,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that tough to do in that arena where there's just all those people?

603
00:47:59,924 --> 00:48:03,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you able to just block it out and be like, I gotta focus on the game?

604
00:48:03,365 --> 00:48:07,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that really just a huge distraction when it's all those people?

605
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:16,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm used to being on stage in much more embarrassing situations because I've been in cosplay skits and cosplay events and stuff.

606
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,649
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it wasn't as hard.

607
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:24,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like all your years of cosplaying helped you prepare for that moment.

608
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:24,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

609
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:26,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hamming it up, though.

610
00:48:26,431 --> 00:48:35,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I was giving Hunger Games signs, like the three-finger salute to people in the front, and people were cheering for me, starting chants and stuff.

611
00:48:35,894 --> 00:48:36,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really fun.

612
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:39,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And may the odds be ever in your favor.

613
00:48:39,695 --> 00:48:40,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

614
00:48:40,995 --> 00:48:46,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you know what games are going to be involved with this Omegathon at PAX East in a couple weeks?

615
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:47,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

616
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:49,777
[SPEAKER_05]: They revealed it to us last week.

617
00:48:50,356 --> 00:48:51,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Bomberman, NBA Jam, Jenga

618
00:49:04,766 --> 00:49:05,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

619
00:49:05,346 --> 00:49:07,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they usually throw a board game or something in there.

620
00:49:07,687 --> 00:49:09,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen Jenga before.

621
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:11,407
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you doing to prepare?

622
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:16,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you preparing at all, or are you just like, I'm going to wing it?

623
00:49:16,488 --> 00:49:20,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually just practicing with my friends.

624
00:49:20,229 --> 00:49:29,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend named Norm who is a tournament winner of Bomberman, so he's been coaching me, and all we're really missing is I, the tiger, playing in the background.

625
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:30,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha ha!

626
00:49:31,992 --> 00:49:32,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm terrible.

627
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I am terrible right now.

628
00:49:34,393 --> 00:49:37,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I have just made a pass not killing myself.

629
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:41,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jenga, I don't think I can prepare for at all.

630
00:49:41,898 --> 00:49:48,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And NBA Jam, I'm going to move on to as soon as I feel like I don't suck abysmally at bottom, man.

631
00:49:50,484 --> 00:49:53,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I give you a hint on Jenga that doesn't involve ibuprofen?

632
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:54,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

633
00:49:54,646 --> 00:49:55,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Practice with your left hand.

634
00:49:56,347 --> 00:49:57,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Practice with my left hand.

635
00:49:57,468 --> 00:49:59,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good tip.

636
00:49:59,169 --> 00:50:00,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to practice that.
