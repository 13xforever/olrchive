31482	37247	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

51299	57764	Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, gamer lols, anything gamer, and maybe a little bit of other stuff too.
58264	61646	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.
61786	64788	Say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
69652	73054	Jamie Summers has been replaced by a monster on tonight's show.
74095	76216	By one of those little gurgly things in WoW.
77397	77977	Oh, the murlocs?
78018	78338	Murlocs.
78458	78778	Murlocs.
81256	85818	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki, who ate a murloc for dinner.
86598	87759	Yeah, sort of.
87779	88279	I helped.
89439	90019	How you doing, Loki?
90360	91080	I'm doing fine.
91180	93441	Just making sure I'm being picked up on the mic.
93521	94881	Your mic is good.
95421	98783	I don't know what that was about.
99203	103384	That was Pope Francis actually intervening and hoping that you wouldn't be heard tonight.
103404	106286	You know he's still trying to get rid of that old Pope smell.
107706	109788	Anyhow, say hello.
109808	112070	We have a special guest joining us tonight in studio.
112430	117674	I want to give a big hello and welcome back to an old friend of Orange Lounge Radio who I haven't seen in a couple months.
117715	119156	So I'm super excited.
119196	123319	He took the drive all the way from the Bay Area just to be here with us tonight.

183466	184727	Live.VogNetwork.com
204120	209867	First recipient of Bachelor of Fine Arts in New Media at Emerson College in Boston, originally from Detroit, Dearborn.
218237	223859	Worked for over five years at Telltale Games, making over 60 titles, more or less.
224399	225120	Episodes are weird.
227500	237624	I also co-founded Umlaut, which is a rock band charity concert in San Francisco and broadcasted around the world for Child's Play charity and stuff.
240091	240711	and other things.
241031	242792	Is that enough?
243573	244373	No, it's perfect.
244493	245133	That's lots of stuff.
245353	246374	Well, we talk about Umlaut.
246394	250636	Let's start with Umlaut because we've talked a lot about Umlaut on the show and we've all participated.
250676	252676	We've gone to past events and so forth.
252696	260780	It's a great thing that the whole Northern California community really gets involved with and now really the world too.
262300	267301	Have you been surprised in a positive way at how well Umlaut's been received?
268242	273103	It's such a crazy journey, this thing.
277104	285726	I was actually one of the first to play Guitar Hero because I playtested Guitar Hero 1 way back in the day in Central Square.
287788	305687	and I always wanted to see an event that focused on performance rather than score because the score didn't really interest me too much so much as the performance aspect and you know a few years when I moved over here to California the
307108	307949	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
334127	334727	Pitch Me, Band Ideas
362605	363026	and all this.
363086	374097	And just the amount of talent that comes out of it and just the creativity and the fervor of excitement that comes out of each umlaut is just absolutely amazing.
374437	384327	And it wouldn't happen if it weren't for the amazing year-round team that helps put on this show together.
386108	388869	Literally, I mean, it is not just me.
389630	391131	I hate it when people are like, oh, it's your thing.
391151	393692	I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, it's not my thing.
393772	395273	It is our thing.
396094	400216	And, you know, we've been able to raise quite a bit of money.
400937	402317	How much did you pull in this last year?
402377	405679	This last year, we're looking, it's around $41,000.
408161	408941	I remember it was about $40,000.
409161	412263	Yeah, we got a few things also rolled in late.
413203	413903	So it's about $41,000.
415484	416344	Not a bad chunk of change.
416364	416644	Not bad.
416764	417404	Not bad at all.
417984	419305	That's for a great cause, too.
419585	420545	It's fun to work on.
423686	427308	Jamie, of course, I know did a lot of graphic design and stuff for it.
427328	429789	So yeah, it's a fun way for everybody to get involved.
430329	433850	Do you have a lot of people that are kind of throwing themselves at you going, let me help?
435189	440093	Yeah, you know, once we get, you know, we're definitely going to be expanding more this year.
440193	448499	We really want to expand the headliner program, which was a wild success this year, to explain what that is.
448639	451661	So, Umlaut to Perform, it's a donation.
451701	454903	Last year it was, how much, $200,000?
456524	462828	Last year for a band package, and you split that between your band members, so it's not that much at all.
462848	466851	It's 200 a band, but if your band has, what, seven people, what, three vocalists?
466911	468372	Yeah.
469212	477238	We have an upper limit of seven just to help manage the cards and all that, but it doesn't have to be seven.
477258	480039	So you can't be like Gwar getting up there with a big cup?
480059	482041	Well, there's a stage limit as well, but...
482761	501415	uh well like one of the bands this is one of the headliners um French Kiss uh incorporated other friends that had confetti poppers everywhere and we we earned our cleaning fee this year with them oh man just confetti everywhere
502376	506039	How's the response from the people who can't be there in person?
506099	508941	Have you found that your internet presence has really grown?
509602	513285	We had a real boon with a partnership with Twitch.
513345	516227	They featured us on the website and that just shot up.
516607	520490	And also with Tim Schafer hosting was definitely an attraction.
521731	525494	Thank you for reminding me of that because that was quite the feature for Umlaut this year.
525514	525634	How
525674	526515	How did you manage that?
555613	558434	Awesome.
558534	560054	Yeah.
560074	567116	We kept that under wraps for a few months because we wanted it to be Tim Schafer's hosting and here's where you buy tickets.
568416	571477	Here's a great question for somebody that's been in the industry as long as you have.
571897	578919	Since you brought up keeping secrets and you've worked for Telltale for many years and obviously they had some huge games over those years.
579279	581380	You have to keep a lot of secrets when you work in this industry.
581740	582380	How hard is that?
582600	582860	Very.
583761	593349	The hardest secret I ever had to keep was keeping from my sister Carolyn the fact that we were working on Tales of Monkey Island.
594570	596612	That was the hardest because...
598073	608782	My sister and I grew up on the Scum era, and I leaned more towards the Sam & Max, she leaned more towards the Monkey Island side, but there's definitely shared love between the two.
610844	620372	But I had to keep that secret for much longer than I would have liked, and I certainly heard about it from her.
620392	621293	Yeah.
622934	624395	I bet, I bet.
624476	632262	I told her a half hour before we were going live with the announcement, just so I could say that I told her before.
633764	637367	If you guys have 30 minutes before, that's great.
638047	640988	If you guys have questions for Seg, live.vognetwork.com.
641008	647570	You can ask whatever you'd like, within reason, either about Umlaut or Space Between Studios or whatever.
649110	653792	I do want to talk about your new studio, but I had another quick question about Umlaut because I know this has got to be something that's on your mind.
653832	655832	It's on a lot of people's mind when it comes to rock band.
656192	659613	They've announced no more DLC after, what is it, two weeks?
659773	661514	It's like the last DLC we're ever going to see.
662014	666038	Which, you know, the end had to happen at some point, right?
666078	673466	Like, it's hard to be upset about the end of Rock Band DLC when no other game in the history of gaming has been supported the way the Rock Band has been.
673486	674106	Yeah, five years.
674406	674947	Let's be real.
675347	676709	And with as much as they've got, right?
677269	683556	So, are you worried, though, that, like, uh-oh, if this means that Rock Band is sunsetting...
684176	685577	What's going to happen to Umlaut?
711977	717264	So, that's what I point to, not just to blindly say, oh yeah, we're still going to do it.
717344	723913	No, the evidence of all the people that just want to pour in all the performances who just...
726223	736349	To me, our marketing challenge for our event is getting people to experience for the first time Umlaut, whether it's online or in person.
736889	742933	Because we know that once people experience it, they're coming back next year or really heavily regretting it.
744214	748276	So we know we have a very good event on our hands.
748316	751318	We know we have an event that people love, that people want to participate in.
752278	777095	and uh harmonics moving on from rock band doesn't uh hasn't altered that so so maybe it'll be a dance party with Dance Central in a couple years surely you've kicked that idea around I mean we've kicked the idea yeah but obvious conclusion right I mean it's it's hard to do you know it's hard to do that on stage because well for one it's only two people and then it's it's yeah it's
777415	779155	It's not a main stage thing.
779195	785617	We want to push as many bands and people on stage just because we're only doing it one night.
785637	790378	We want to make sure that we get as many people to experience the big stage.
791438	793879	It really is the performance of it all, too.
793919	794359	It's funny.
794579	797600	If you look back at the history of this show, we started around DDR.
797660	801721	We used to do episodes of this show live from Dance Dance Revolution tournaments and stuff.
802461	808630	Let me tell you, they'll always be somewhere in gaming, like a performance game.
808670	810092	I think we've seen that ever since, really.
810112	812355	I guess DDR probably was the first of that that I could think of.
812695	814057	It was a performance-based game.
814198	816681	I want to see a Visual K-themed band next year.
817122	819465	That's my personal challenge out to anybody, by the way.
819565	846935	anything is possible I try not to meddle in the affairs of bands but I just want to put out there I would love to see someone do a mashup and or a Weird Al rendition of a song because the game's on no fail so you don't worry about score anyways I wish people would explore the space that's what we do at my house
848796	852521	Yeah, I've seen people do... Because Born This Way, right?
852541	854263	So you can do the whole perform this way.
854283	855024	You can totally do it.
855044	856145	It's good times.
857267	859029	Isn't Lola in there?
859129	860390	Because I think we've done Yoda.
860410	862233	Perhaps.
862293	862573	Yeah.
864455	865456	What else did I want to ask about?
865556	868578	Oh, one other question I got about Umla and then I want to talk about some of your other projects too.
869558	881305	Do you get people, you know, since you have had success on the internet and you're recognized on Twitch as a national thing now, it's not just something that's NorCal, do you get people coming to you going,
882707	885510	How do I have an umlaut in Tallahassee, Florida?
885691	888755	Or how do I do an umlaut in Titicaca?
888795	890838	There's definitely a request for that.
891458	892400	Bring umlaut to me.
893161	894683	There's sort of two prongs to that answer.
894743	896485	As far as the umlaut branding...
897987	911352	We don't know exactly how to, for us under the Umlaut brand, to franchise and do it in such a way that we can ensure that the quality and...
912992	918313	The organization is up to our standards, you know, to make sure that, you know, things are above board.
918333	927175	It's not like, you know, it's not that I imagine people being shady about it, but it's not something we can just go, oh, yeah, use, you know, use the Umla brand and all that.
927195	935776	So, you know, we're very, we're protective on it because we want to make sure we do something, you know, we do it right if we branch out with the Umla brand.
936336	939497	As far as, but not like you need us either.
939517	940517	Yeah.
941877	951882	It all comes down to, do you have enough people and enough partnerships you can start to make a thing together and to rent out a place?
953183	957665	And if you have enough of a community around to pull out the rock band and make it happen.
958225	958425	So...
960566	972591	You know, it's more event planning than the rock band part, because believe me, as the sound techs at DNA Lounge, where we have our event, have told me we're one of the easier shows to tech.
974492	974872	I bet.
975092	980334	Yeah, it's microphones and looped back and the monitors, but the rest of the instruments.
980354	981775	That part's the easiest, right?
981835	982175	Yeah.
983016	985458	Do you know what it takes to plan a convention?
1000313	1001354	It would not be pretty.
1001674	1007878	Like, the better idea is to take... Like, Fanime, hey, don't you want like an OLR night or something?
1007898	1008119	Yeah.
1008399	1010000	Try to leech onto something else.
1010060	1010861	That's the only way it's gonna happen.
1010941	1013743	I've been part of a first-gen con.
1014803	1015724	It's first ever.
1015824	1018126	It was called Ground Zero Con in Mobile, Alabama.
1018786	1021927	It's Christmas at Ground Zero
1043232	1049737	The proto-umlaut was actually Fundrauser, which was in a bar, 200 capacity.
1050718	1052400	I wasn't involved, but I went to it.
1053287	1073299	and that packed the place up and that's like okay if day of advertising able to get that many people rolling in and then it was a scale up from there if that was all umlaut ever was now obviously it's turned into something bigger but even if it's just that you're still raising money for a good exactly so why not why not dream a little bigger
1077157	1080400	Speaking of Dream Big, you started your own game studio.
1080540	1081301	Yeah.
1083343	1083804	No pressure.
1085285	1086587	You were at Telltale.
1087908	1089169	Layoffs happened in the industry.
1091211	1092233	It doesn't matter who you work for.
1092513	1094155	These types of things happen.
1094235	1097298	Did you work on Walking Dead?
1098539	1098699	Yes.
1099080	1105047	So that's got to feel real good, though, that you were a part of that because that was such a huge success, right?
1105307	1106529	Yeah.
1106609	1114398	Working through the years and building up the studio and really having all of us...
1116360	1130432	really come to a point where we're really recognized for our work is just a testament to the years of dedication we all put in to make that go.
1131332	1134835	So, you know, there's that old saying, when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade.
1134955	1141560	So you certainly have done that in some regard with this whole thing because, you know, unfortunately you took that bad news that happened there.
1141820	1148565	And, you know, that's just an inevitable fact of that industry, unfortunately, is that, you know, as projects come and go, people come and go, right?
1148625	1150927	We've reported it how many times on this show?
1151347	1152188	How many times on this show?
1152828	1161914	But here we are, now, you know, that all happened at the end of last year, and now here we are, March of this year, and you're like, okay, I'm not going to be the type that just sits on my butt and watches Oprah all day.
1162974	1167097	I'm going to... Well, Oprah's off the air, and I don't have cake.
1167117	1168998	Well, no, she has a network now.
1169018	1171940	What's the line, when life gives you lemons, you demand to see life's manager?
1174201	1178904	But you've turned that into a game studio, so how did that, did you just, did you wake up one day and go...
1179571	1180972	You know, I should start a game studio.
1181012	1187796	Well, I should really talk more about the project, and the studio kind of comes after that a little bit.
1188317	1199844	And I wanted to... After the layoff, I was thinking of why I love video games so much, why I've dedicated...
1201145	1205067	My life, my career to video games and all that.
1205507	1219614	And I've had this idea floating around of making a project that explained how video games communicate as an art form.
1220174	1229779	I went through school for it and actually kind of made my own curriculum because I was the first person to go through my program.
1231220	1251557	And there's a lot of things that we know, but very few have really pinned it down, put some definitions onto it, put some context on it, and delivered it in a way that a general public would actually play through and all that.
1251637	1255861	So I wanted to make a video game of video games.
1256950	1283697	trying to wrap my head around this idea a lot i know we we talk about like artistic video games we we think a lot about like flower and journey you know the things that that game company have done the art in that maybe even like so much the art of storytelling in a game like walking dead certainly it affected a lot of people when it's it's storytelling so what's what's the difference between like a artsy video game because that's not what you're talking about you're not talking about making an artsy video game you're talking about making a video game that tell like
1285031	1286352	I'm trying to wrap my head around it a little bit.
1286452	1292214	Think of, you know, in high school or in college, you know, there are film appreciation classes.
1293154	1294835	You know, like a film appreciation one-on-one class.
1295035	1295315	Okay.
1295955	1309561	Where, you know, that class, you're walking in there, you know, it's not like you haven't experienced film before, but those classes are to bring some terminology and some understanding and perspective in.
1310702	1317768	about how artists use this particular form of media to communicate ideas.
1318489	1321752	I want to make the video games appreciation 101 class.
1322733	1326716	And rather than making it a book where
1327657	1340088	I would be going like, oh, this concept, like in this game, assuming you played that game, but if you're going in for a video game appreciation textbook, you can assume that they haven't played that particular game.
1340748	1347594	So rather, I wanted to make a game so instead of just textually writing about it and talking about it and all that, it's like, no, here is the concept.
1347674	1348775	Let's put it out in front of you.
1348855	1354060	Let's have you experience it the way it's intended to in that form of media.
1354800	1359865	So you can actually really get a deep understanding by doing rather than rote.
1360225	1362988	So this is the game that will make Roger Ebert understand.
1363649	1363989	Yeah.
1364870	1365650	You know, I'm trying not to...
1367088	1375117	I will say that the piece won't spend much time trying to answer the question, is video games art?
1375137	1376859	Because it's just simply, yes, they are art.
1376939	1377560	Let's move on.
1379442	1384247	That's the opinionated opinion I'm starting with on this piece.
1384347	1384988	Yes, they're art.
1385288	1385929	Let's go into it.
1387270	1391511	So you know the result you want.
1392031	1393791	How are we going to get there?
1394412	1397732	Good question.
1397912	1407494	So I have a few people that are working on it sort of part-time and part-part-time on it.
1408374	1415416	I have Jessica Johnson being a writer for me and being sort of the foil and keeping me into focus of the actual content of it.
1417478	1423324	I have Dan as a programmer that's very interested in working with me on the project.
1424345	1428549	But really it comes down to funding, to be quite honest.
1428749	1437398	And the bugger about this kind of project is, usually when you go out for funding for a game and all that, when you're doing it professionally, air quotes,
1438899	1466534	is that you say well here's similar games that we're trying to make and here was their return on investment here's where their profitability and here's where we're going to twist and make something different I don't have any game to point to that is anywhere similar to this no one has made a video game about video games to the kind of depth and length that I'm searching for with this piece
1467274	1470699	So, it turns me to do the inevitable Kickstarter.
1471660	1479571	I was just going to ask, because a year ago I wouldn't have been able to ask you, but now that we're in 2013, is Kickstarter the answer for this?
1479832	1481794	That currently is my answer.
1482055	1483657	Or Indiegogo, or any of those...
1484237	1511940	I'm doing Kickstarter because I want to if I'm doing this I want to do it in a way that actually funds the game and that's going to be six figures easy because I want to respect the people that are going to work on this for me and that means paying them decently so it ends up being a six figure figure and
1514901	1518622	Indiegogo is just not producing those kinds of results consistently.
1518682	1523564	There is a branding of Kickstarter that you can't dismiss.
1525485	1535228	I mean, sure, I would love to have some capital investment come in, swoop down, and make it go, but barring that...
1536328	1552720	I really need to prove that there's an audience for this and really the available way to do that in this case I believe is through Kickstarter because then I can say here are these people who actually put money down that actually want to have this thing happen.
1553420	1556661	How are you preparing for this Kickstarter?
1556901	1560882	So, you know, it's a lot of, you know, there's budget for one.
1561202	1564083	I have a spreadsheet that is so dynamic.
1565323	1568364	Well, thank God you've had to do some financial planning for Umlaut in the past, right?
1568404	1569224	Yeah, I know, right?
1569744	1571324	You're not going into this totally blind.
1571384	1571584	Yeah.
1574745	1599391	I have quite a bit of experience of doing budgets and all that and I have to say that I've had a really good business teacher and that's my father or Uncle Ed to you Hi Dad I think I see him in chat He had a comment earlier in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com about Tim Schafer at Umlaut and that he was a great addition to Umlaut this year
1601475	1626788	and Uncle Ed is a great addition to Umlaut he does the books and everything among many other things but he is a former Ford employee and I learned enough about business to go about knowing enough about business to know when I need an adult laughter
1628208	1643356	and which man that's a bit you know I through the years really realizing how special and unique that is because boy we all have seen people who really don't know how to business and and don't
1644736	1646097	understand for themselves.
1646658	1653382	Heck yeah, there's been so many moments during the times of OLR in the past where, you know, we're trying to do something, it's like, I need an adult!
1656165	1672957	So, you know, I'm not going in this completely blindly, but so, you know, there's making the budget and figure out, okay, how much is needed, what is going to be the markup of Kickstarter fees and credit card fees and all that, and then the fulfillment fees and
1674202	1699082	of the actual prizes and all that that run down from how much is bandwidth going to cost to deliver on final thing to all the physical items, what's good, what's not good, and trying to balancing all those numbers so that if this thing gets green-lighted, I'm not going, well, I have these thousands of dollars worth of stuff I have to pay for in order to get to people.
1699162	1700163	Well, crap.
1700744	1700884	Yeah.
1701951	1730605	you may not have the answer to this question yet but let me try to throw it out there anyway just because this is the question that people will be asking once this goes live but you know why am I going to want to donate to this why will I want to donate and help Space Between Studios create this game what this game is intending to do is be the community's way of illustrating to the rest of the world why video games
1731855	1741422	Why we love video games and why we think video games is unique as a form of art that communicates ideas.
1742642	1751548	And to answer that in the way of what makes video games work to communicate ideas.
1751709	1757032	Why are we attracted to the things that we like about video games?
1757653	1760935	Why are we dissuaded about the things that don't work about video games?
1761960	1767385	Will you be able to answer the question why we've been sitting here for the past 11 years every Sunday night talking about this crap?
1768006	1772731	Well, you know, that's more in the psychology end.
1773171	1775614	That was a nice way of saying nobody can answer that.
1777776	1778897	That would be an exercise.
1779558	1781560	That would be a true exercise in recursive thinking.
1783712	1785173	He's a game designer, not a head doctor.
1786694	1788755	I didn't mean to make it about us.
1789315	1790215	It's about us.
1790395	1791296	It's on our show.
1791316	1799439	I had to ask.
1799760	1809444	We don't have this fully fleshed out as far as the outline because I also want to hear from the community at large, and this is development and players, of
1811517	1821808	What are the things about video games we would want to communicate to people who may not know or play video games all that well but have an interest just to know more?
1822629	1834521	And I don't think throwing people to any one particular game is going to begin to answer what the diaspora of video games are.
1835061	1845485	So this is going to be a piece that is a sort of neutral ground where it doesn't make an assumption of what experience level and what you've played before.
1846106	1849547	That's both not played before or super experience.
1849587	1854569	I'm not making initial assumptions of audience that way.
1854609	1856210	We'll customize based off of experience.
1856670	1857731	How you approach things.
1858192	1859833	We'll take those creative choices there.
1860874	1868801	But really want to present something that we can go, hey, oh, you want to know more about video games?
1868941	1873025	Just get this game and play and then we'll talk about it after.
1873405	1878510	And if you really want to know, it's going to cost you because we hear gamers love microtransactions.
1879110	1880391	Oh, no, no.
1880431	1881532	I'm not doing that.
1882990	1883490	Now, now.
1883530	1884090	He had to.
1884110	1884471	He had to.
1885531	1887232	Will your game be always online required?
1887252	1887792	No.
1887872	1889233	Just get that out now.
1889333	1889653	All right.
1890393	1890753	No.
1893314	1900337	I'll have the game that's DRM-free, Windows, Linux, Mac.
1901377	1902378	Is it coming to the OUYA?
1904062	1909804	Well, you know, that's the other consoles and platforms I'm definitely not saying no to.
1910104	1917706	I'm sticking to the big three desktop platforms because I can 100% promise that 100% go and all that.
1918406	1922667	We are using Unity, so it's not gating other platforms outright.
1923128	1923628	It's just...
1924668	1939499	I'd rather promise things we can deliver on and it's not that I mean there are other avenues that I am exploring I just I only want to promise the things I can promise don't write checks your ass can't cash we all heard that before
1940039	1967720	it's not like I'm mentioning that Minecraft will be on a dot dot dot if I'm torn on whether to ask you this question or not because this question can be perceived as a negative from our chat room but I think it's a tough question and I've been through worse I'm going to say if you're going to take it to the internet you're going to get this so let me ask you this question from RossDLUT in the chat room that says so this is a testament to the community's insecurity and need for approval are gamers insecure?
1968271	1970212	Well, no, it's not a statement.
1970752	1971112	I'm sorry.
1971632	1979756	It's not the impression of just gamers need to themselves need to like defend or whatever.
1980276	1987599	It's just there hasn't been a really good academic text that's approachable.
1988479	1990921	Could this be a celebration of gaming?
1991382	1992743	It's a celebration of gaming.
1993784	2001471	I mean, I'm making my pitch a little bit geared towards more of people who have played games because I think if you're listening to this show, I can make that assumption.
2001871	2003392	That's a good way of thinking.
2003412	2005734	Just saying.
2006355	2007456	No judging, but you know.
2008536	2014663	Well, going back to the academic approach, though, what about having it as a tool for, like, say, officials?
2015223	2023792	You know, people who are making those legislation about... Well, I don't want the piece to become an out-and-out political tool.
2024773	2028597	I'm making, very consciously, not going into...
2029438	2033082	Topical things or even current topics.
2033823	2041591	For example, I'm not going to touch behavior of online chat and XBLA and all that.
2042572	2043894	Comment threads on the internet.
2043914	2045155	There's nothing artistic about that.
2048939	2052822	I'll just keep Tumblr out of it because all anyone does is talk about Mass Effect.
2052922	2054483	I'm bringing that out.
2054623	2057846	It's not even so much like this is a text of the community.
2059227	2063190	This is just how video games communicate as an art form.
2063930	2073097	But to that end, as tools, one of the plans I have for the Kickstarter reward tiers is
2073557	2089632	is you get a digital copy but you can pick a library classroom whatever academic it's you know whatever can I'm leaving a little bit broad you know so people if people come up with something that we haven't thought about that would fit in there
2090632	2113939	community service organization but a kit that's so far speccing as two physical DVDs a site license documentation saying yes this institution has a site license for the game so it's not limited to the two physical copies and two physical copies of the softcover handbook that we're also going to produce as a sort of companion piece with it
2115319	2135248	and that's a you know you get a thing but then you can send out a thing and that's going to be on the little on the the little more upper range because that's an expensive sure you know more expensive than a digitally downloadable thing but you know I am putting the cut-ins for library in that educational text but I'm also not trying to make this edutainment uh
2135988	2137929	This isn't just the pure academic.
2137949	2139851	I'm trying to take the approach.
2140311	2146174	This is actually more speaking to where I want to go in a studio perspective.
2148136	2156081	I want to take my approach of how I've approached all of these licensed properties and all that that I worked in in Telltale and all that.
2158582	2187298	where I take this canon from Strong Bad and it has this very well documented wiki which was such a boon I have to say that the Homestar wiki helped out so much but taking the approach and care I've done to all these fictional franchises and take that same approach but to non-fictional things where the canon is reality
2188979	2197004	So, and understanding video games is the piece that is my first piece in that approach.
2197484	2206289	Because what I guess for the most part when it comes to edutainment or serious games or whatever you want to call it, I'm not trying to make a complete blanket statement, but...
2208970	2225982	There just seems to be this disconnect of all the rich development and decisions being made on fictional games that are wonderful and awesome, but it's just not transferring over to other fields and other things that would really benefit from it.
2226822	2237750	And this is sort of my particular answer to try and give the perspective of we don't necessarily need to do straight-up fiction work with our art form.
2238786	2254362	well you've got quite a path ahead of you until you get to the end I do kind of want to wrap up so we can move on talk about the weekend news but if somebody wants to keep tabs on your project on the Kickstarter that'll be coming eventually how can they do that?
2254862	2273127	SpaceBetweenStudios.com and it has all the social media blah blah blah The Twitter's, the Facebook's, the Google Plus even cause why not and oh no Harrison's there?
2273627	2273767	Ha!
2275273	2275893	What's up, Harrison?
2275933	2278634	Sorry, I'm totally reading chat and totally distracting myself.
2278694	2279475	Damn you, Harrison!
2280115	2281095	It took us forever.
2281515	2282856	We used to do the same thing.
2282876	2285257	It would be like our show would be us reading the chat room.
2285657	2289099	Well, I'm just seeing Bobby going, Harrison Pink.
2289199	2296541	I would actually love, Sag, because there is kind of like a spirited debate going on about what is the purpose of this.
2296802	2302664	So I would love for you to continue on in our chat room after we're done talking here and we get into the news.
2304165	2307886	SpaceBetweenStudios.com and on the Twitters and all that stuff.
2309447	2314869	I know this is probably so early, but I'd be made fun of if I didn't ask this as a commentator.
2316070	2317370	Any idea on the time frame?
2317670	2325634	Assuming Greenlight and everything, if the Kickstarter passes and I'm able to be solvent on that...
2326874	2339378	I'm currently looking at a, well, it'd be ambitious if I said December 2014, but it's probably going to be January 2015 for digital release.
2340258	2347260	And I'm purposefully putting a two month block of the physical releases of stuff because I want to make sure things are...
2348700	2360765	completely bug free before I mint the final physical discs or anything but everyone would get the digital when I'm not splitting hairs there
2362193	2363354	Well, good luck.
2365476	2365976	I'll need it.
2368658	2372761	I am so... I just want to... I can't wait to just see it.
2373001	2373462	You know what I mean?
2373542	2377905	It's one thing to kind of hear you describe it, and then I'm kind of like, I just can't wait to kind of jump in.
2377925	2380767	Because there is so... You know, when you think about it, it's like a celebration.
2381227	2383469	I mean, you know, what we're talking about here.
2383729	2384170	I mean, this...
2384830	2390354	This show, my life would be dramatically different if video games didn't exist, right?
2390394	2396039	And, you know, I'm sure we all have that story of mom growing up saying, you keep playing those games, you'll never amount to anything.
2396199	2397260	Isn't that right, Uncle Ed?
2398241	2406487	And, you know, now, well, video games have helped you raise, over the years, probably $100,000 at this point for charity, right?
2406907	2407568	Over the five years?
2407588	2407968	We're at $40,000.
2409409	2410911	Okay, well...
2411471	2412532	It's about, I'm going to say 80k.
2412612	2416734	I mean, regardless, a huge number.
2416774	2420295	And that is because of your love of video games, our love for video games.
2421316	2433282	You know, wanting to perform that, wanting to, you know, show the community gamers aren't just crazy people on Xbox with guns that shoot children.
2433402	2436223	You know, that's not what gamers are at all.
2436771	2439414	The one point I do want to make and then we can actually continue on.
2439494	2441235	Sure, no worries.
2441696	2454327	With the Kickstarter and all that, I am, and you can hold me to the fire on this, when we go into development with this, you are going to hear from us constantly.
2454367	2457430	We're going to make sure we do at least once a month
2457990	2464876	General, like, you know, what we did in the past month thing, but it's also trying to be available in forums and all that.
2464936	2471182	So we're not going to be one of those Kickstarters that, like, don't say anything for a few months and everyone's like, stop.
2472663	2480130	You know, so we... And this piece won't exist if it won't... If the community doesn't participate with it.
2480230	2480450	So...
2481751	2488977	This isn't, I mean, yes, ultimately we make final decisions with the piece, but it is not going to be in a vacuum.
2489137	2492940	It is going to need everyone else's participation.
2493320	2494882	I love these comments in the chat room.
2494942	2496663	I've got to read these before we move on.
2496683	2497364	I haven't been looking.
2497404	2498024	Sorry, Chad.
2498304	2501367	Harrison Pink in our chat room, HG Pink says, Everyone back SAG.
2501567	2503989	He's a smart guy who loves games and won't steal from you.
2504486	2505326	Oh, thank you, Harrison.
2505386	2506647	I miss you, man.
2506787	2511009	Uncle Ed, just defending himself a little bit in chat, so I think it's fair to read this.
2511489	2513790	I gave you the TRS-80 in the early 80s.
2514030	2515430	Your mother's the one that had issues with it.
2515451	2516251	That's what I was saying.
2517211	2519052	That's what I meant with that comment.
2519132	2521293	Isn't that right that mom said that, Uncle Ed?
2523174	2525095	Fair enough.
2525996	2527157	Again, best of luck to you.
2527277	2534261	Not just with Space Between Studios but with Umlaut going into this year and whatever else may come.
2534802	2536663	You will be at PAX East as an attendee.
2536823	2542487	I am a crazy person because I'm doing PAX this week.
2543368	2544889	We leave hopefully Tuesday.
2545109	2547590	Apparently it's going to be fun time weather so we'll see.
2548011	2551133	Tuesday, Sin and I will be going to Boston.
2553054	2553695	Bless Sin.
2553815	2557398	Her birthday's Wednesday and I'm throwing her a birthday party in Boston?
2558430	2560090	To which she knows no one there.
2561071	2563611	She has never met anyone there because she doesn't know anyone in Boston.
2563952	2567273	There's one friend from here that's also coming along.
2567313	2569693	But everyone else is like, meet my friends.
2570113	2571914	Parties with strangers can be the best kind.
2572154	2574795	Yes, they can.
2574935	2576875	So I'll be at PAX this weekend.
2577395	2583017	I think I make a sign that says, ask me about video games and park myself somewhere and see what happens.
2584850	2585230	Why not?
2585250	2585990	Yeah, exactly.
2586010	2587271	It works for the free hugs guy.
2587351	2587971	I know, right?
2589351	2590331	And then you're going to GDC.
2590451	2593272	And then GDC because I'm a crazy person.
2593572	2595273	And I get back the Monday.
2595313	2599294	I mean, GDC starts Monday, but I have the Wednesday through Friday pass.
2599314	2601794	But apparently there's stuff I can go to on the Tuesday.
2601914	2607576	So I'm going to go to the Facebook day and the Google day.
2607816	2608896	It's all these sponsored ones.
2610976	2611817	Come equipped with Pocky.
2612577	2612857	Why?
2613057	2613577	You are right.
2614482	2615003	Free candy.
2616566	2617748	You can be a stranger with candy.
2619752	2623780	Okay, so, and by the way, just so you know, Uncle Ed said in chat, ouch, she just hit me.
2626860	2627320	There you go.
2628121	2629182	That's hilarious.
2629362	2630383	Well, have fun at PAX East.
2630423	2631224	Have fun at GDC.
2631304	2639310	So apparently if the listeners want to say hi to you at PAX East, talk to you in person about this, look for the guy who has the sign that says, ask me about video games.
2640691	2641032	Perfect.
2641332	2644174	I'm sure at some point you will find the VOG contingent.
2644815	2645475	Bobby Black will.
2645495	2646656	I'm sure they'll find me.
2646676	2647257	They'll find you.
2647397	2647977	Absolutely.
2648157	2648718	Absolutely.
2648938	2650019	Let's be realistic here.
2650499	2653502	There is a social media that I think you should add to the list.
2654642	2655083	Tumblr.
2655363	2655843	Oh, God.
2656904	2660066	There is much wank on Tumblr, but much spreading of information.
2660666	2662147	I'm not hating on Tumblr.
2662247	2664128	I would never want to incur that wrath.
2667070	2669432	I've left almost all social media for Tumblr.
2669492	2670852	Tumblr is a very interesting place.
2670893	2671533	I love the GIFs.
2672353	2677937	Yeah, there's a few friends that I follow on the Tumblrs, but I do not have a Tumblr.
2679456	2683281	Say thanks again for being here tonight and you will stay and talk about the week in news.
2683581	2685564	Of course, because I have opinions.
2685944	2686405	Excellent.
2686425	2686946	Don't we all?
2687306	2689169	Alright, so let's talk about our gaming week.
2689189	2693334	So we'll move a little quickly tonight because we are... Because I talk forever.
2693354	2693855	You know what?
2694115	2694536	You know what?
2696318	2696758	You earned it.
2697038	2699039	Alright, DarkSakura, how was your game?
2699079	2700259	What the crap else do I play?
2700639	2702299	Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3.
2703459	2705800	Because I was actually playing around with modding Mass Effect 2.
2706520	2711561	I love that Bioware's like, yeah, go ahead, mod it all you want, EA patch.
2712541	2712841	Damn it.
2713721	2721303	So, yeah, I've been playing a lot more Mass Effect and a little bit more To The Moon because that game is absolutely...
2722683	2724786	Just it causes the feels to happen.
2724886	2726448	It makes the feels happen and they hurt.
2728371	2730934	And then I've been looking at a few other things.
2731055	2735861	But honestly, my job right now is going to the gym and looking for a job.
2736001	2738745	So yeah, that's about it.
2740011	2741091	Well, then we'll move on to Loki.
2741111	2741812	How was your gaming week?
2742632	2747034	Actually, I've been playing a ton of Saints Row the Third, ironically enough.
2747934	2753736	And so I started playing again with my co-worker, which is probably going to end that pretty soon because he's leaving.
2755317	2760319	We've been playing co-op on 360 with the full package.
2761439	2766141	And actually haven't really been playing a DLC because it sucks, but main game.
2766941	2768963	And so we've been messing around with that a little bit.
2769664	2774608	And then on PC, I finally got my copy.
2774628	2780573	Well, I had my copy since that THQ sale on the Humble Indie Bundle, THQ Bundle.
2781353	2792543	And so I've been playing a heavily modded version of the game, mainly just so I could get the additional cheat that was actually missing from the console version, which was the evil car code.
2792863	2795005	I love the evil car code from the other games.
2795485	2798026	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2814675	2821843	on the Steam version and hopefully I'm going to do the same on the console version because I've been trying to finish missions differently because I lost my save that I had.
2821883	2826909	I had an in-game save with almost everything done and sure enough I don't know where it is.
2827750	2828711	Dope.
2828731	2830953	You need to save your games in the cloud.
2830993	2831734	Oh, fuck that.
2832595	2834257	I am not saving shit in the cloud.
2838820	2843701	Clearly gamers want their saves in the cloud because they keep losing them.
2844681	2845522	That's what gamers want.
2845542	2847842	We're hearing gamers loud and clear on what they want.
2848802	2850343	You know what I used to call the cloud?
2850483	2851303	The internet!
2851903	2852543	That's what it is.
2852603	2854103	It's a fucking internet.
2854123	2856244	You're saving it to a server somewhere else.
2858084	2861925	Why would I want to do that when I can just save it to a memory card that I know where the fuck it is?
2862105	2863808	Oh, and hey, if the internet's down, guess what?
2863868	2868415	My save still works because it's on a memory card and not in the fucking cloud.
2869236	2871740	So, no, I'm fine not saving to the cloud.
2871880	2874103	Although I do have one cloud save right now.
2874143	2877008	It's my old Minecraft save for Xbox Live Arcade.
2878050	2878831	I actually agree with you.
2878871	2880753	I turn off all of my cloud storage stuff.
2880993	2885017	I'm thinking about taking it out because I hate having the second option pop up all the time for saves.
2885337	2886018	I turn it on.
2886058	2888300	It's not hurting anything.
2888340	2891963	What I don't like about it is that sometimes it overwrites some of my save files on Mass Effect.
2892724	2893745	Oh, I can see that.
2894406	2897128	So, yeah, I've been playing that and then a little Call of Duty.
2897168	2898970	I'm still playing Call of Duty.
2900618	2902700	And moving, because I also moved.
2902720	2904021	I've been slowly getting back to Team Fortress 2.
2914747	2919111	Team Fortress players want to adopt a SAG?
2936747	2949303	Yes, I have... So, it's funny when I play Team Fortress 2 because I have the rarest, most sought-after item that wasn't the gold wrench in TF2.
2949663	2953308	I have a self-made Max hat because we...
2955890	2965636	Everyone that was working at Telltale at the time when we were releasing Season 3 of Sam & Max, we all got the self-made Max hat so it sparkles because I'm fabulous.
2969158	2971139	That was my role on this show.
2971239	2973640	You've just been out-fabbed.
2975961	2978943	And it's funny because I'll play and then someone will go like...
2979892	2983263	Dude, there's someone with a selfmade or like, dude, why is your hat sparkling?
2983604	2985510	Or, dude, can I trade for your hat?
2988218	2996581	Yes, random internet stranger, I am going to trade the most rarest hat ever to... I'm going to assume they just don't know how rare it is or something.
2996961	2997401	Oh, they do.
2997461	2998582	The ones that ask do.
2998782	3001103	And they're that dumb.
3001203	3005964	They actually took out the tradable flag, so I can't even trade it if I wanted to.
3006784	3012706	Because there were other problems that happened, like someone's account got hacked for it.
3013687	3015868	So they just clamped that down.
3015888	3017068	Over a freaking hat!
3017328	3018009	I know!
3020472	3021613	People like their EPing.
3021894	3024056	Why do you think it went free to play?
3024377	3025979	It still makes money.
3027881	3035190	I don't blame Valve at all for it, and especially since they're doing it in such a way that's much more open than they could have.
3036765	3037746	That they didn't need to?
3038646	3048071	I mean, there was a story a few weeks ago that Newell was talking that they had to talk to PayPal and say, no, he isn't trading drugs.
3048231	3050072	He actually is getting this from digital hats.
3052013	3053533	But anyway, so I've been playing TF2.
3054214	3056635	I've also been going back to Newgrounds.
3058015	3060696	and playing all the small little itty bitty things there.
3062016	3067678	There was one in particular I was really attracted to and I'm actually going to look it up.
3068618	3078400	It had like a death state so you either were alive and could do certain things or then you died and you could do other things and then get back to life and all that.
3078420	3079161	It was a nice little...
3081281	3084663	While you find the name of that, some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
3085204	3089046	SSJ100Matt says, Sage just said he was fabulous, dropped the mic, and walked away.
3089746	3090267	Yes, he did.
3090447	3090947	He did do that.
3090967	3091908	Well, I didn't quite walk away.
3091948	3093569	I'm kind of boxed in here in the seats.
3094049	3097591	Actdeft is suggesting one called TF2NewbiesOnly.com.
3098912	3099753	But you're not a noob.
3100313	3100653	Oh, yeah.
3101714	3102714	I know how to point and click.
3104895	3106076	Revive is the name of it.
3108016	3109617	Which is a really nice little fun game.
3110397	3111017	I do recommend it.
3111157	3112798	Oh, and Harrison's like, congregate, please.
3113078	3115819	And I'm like, and please, I've been on Newgrounds.
3116739	3118580	You wouldn't have YouTube if it weren't for Newgrounds.
3118600	3120000	I'll go on the record in saying that.
3120300	3123541	Because Newgrounds started when I was in high school, which was forever ago.
3125942	3127002	And it's still ticking.
3127022	3127823	You better watch it.
3128063	3128263	Yeah.
3130165	3131968	How old are you again?
3132148	3133250	Because I think I'm a little older.
3135233	3136875	That's why I'm not saying a number.
3137676	3138017	It's alright.
3138812	3166123	but um but anyway so yeah that that's been most of my time has been crawling around new grounds and TF2 oh and moving Tetris in real life yeah Tetris in real life uh Actdeft yes I do hum it too Actdeft in our chat room just to clarify a previous comment saying it's called newbies only to welcome new players but there are a lot of vets there so to be fair to that server um anything else for the gaming week you want to share before we go to me
3167143	3167583	We'll go to you.
3167844	3168084	All right.
3168844	3171606	Honestly, I don't have a lot of new stuff to talk about, so I'll just be real quick.
3172246	3173787	Continuing to progress in Diablo 3.
3174388	3176849	I'm officially way further than I was before.
3176869	3180211	I'm in Act 3 now, which before the furthest I got was at the beginning of Act 2.
3180812	3183313	So, yeah, I guess I'm kind of enjoying it this time.
3183694	3184514	I can't even explain it.
3184734	3185415	Don't ask me why.
3186876	3191098	I think because I'm taking it at my own pace, and I'm actually...
3192279	3194142	And exploring the auction house stuff a little bit.
3194222	3196184	Not the money auction house, but the gold one.
3196265	3199569	And kind of trying to figure out the ins and outs on how to make money there.
3199609	3202613	And that's kind of a fascinating little meta game in and of itself.
3202993	3204736	But the real money auction house, forget it.
3204756	3206859	I mean, all that stuff is the real high-end stuff.
3208060	3209621	Otherwise, been playing Warcraft.
3210022	3213625	Yes, more Mass Effect, but playing a lot of the multiplayer this week.
3213765	3218989	I don't know, there was just kind of like a... One night, we even did some streaming this week, didn't we, DarkSakura?
3219009	3220591	Yeah, that was really... Shane?
3220631	3223934	That was when my character was twitching and spasming on your screen.
3223954	3225575	Yeah, we were just laughing and having a good time.
3225635	3226476	It was really fun.
3226496	3227497	We need to do more game streaming.
3227517	3228538	That was actually fun.
3228818	3230380	And of course, more Tomb Raider.
3230440	3232121	Still getting closer to the end on that one.
3232641	3233923	And then you're going to lend it to me.
3234483	3237345	Sure, I guess, if you'll actually play it, absolutely.
3237666	3240908	I tried playing Mass Effect, and now I bought it on PC.
3240928	3241569	That is true.
3243190	3243830	That is true.
3243930	3247493	So maybe we'll finally get Jamie to talk about another game.
3247553	3250495	If for no other reason, I will loan her Tomb Raider for that fact.
3250535	3251276	You know what, though?
3251356	3252177	I love To The Moon.
3253177	3253397	Oh, yeah.
3253417	3254077	Have you played it?
3254137	3254478	Yes.
3254818	3255798	You need to play To the Moon.
3255818	3256718	I have not played To the Moon.
3256738	3257738	You need to play To the Moon.
3257758	3258058	I will.
3258158	3259119	Yes, sir.
3259179	3260819	Internet, you need to play To the Moon.
3260879	3262860	I'm probably where he's about middle-aged now.
3263540	3265280	I've just been sort of slowly going through it.
3265860	3266481	Have tissues.
3266981	3267241	I know.
3267361	3268861	I already sobbed a little bit.
3268901	3271082	But I found my favorite line.
3271102	3271802	Oh, you don't know.
3271822	3272982	I found my favorite line in the game.
3273522	3276423	It was like, that's the problem with you neurotypicals always telling us what to do.
3277723	3279064	That was my favorite line in the game so far.
3279964	3282185	I did play Civ 5 because I had to try it.
3282285	3287386	Somebody has built a custom mod that allows you to play as certain Mass Effect civilizations.
3288147	3289807	I want to be a Krogan!
3290487	3291548	I don't know if they have those yet.
3291588	3293808	They have Asari and they have Volus.
3293828	3294809	It's kind of fun.
3295969	3298490	So I can talk like this the entire time?
3300245	3307311	alright, there we go that's that for now that's my gaming week, let's move on that's the best hat ever
3317158	3340516	Housekeeping Tonight Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter or of course on Facebook Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio We're also on Google Plus We do have a great Fugle Question of the Week coming up later in the show so make sure you've answered it if you haven't already and I should plug that we are three weeks away from episode 500 Still don't know how we're going to celebrate it but we'll think of something That's going to be in April, won't it?
3340977	3343879	It will be in April It's going to be right before your birthday It will be
3345047	3346428	Ooh, we should definitely have cake.
3347208	3348429	Jamie's like, throw me a party.
3348569	3348909	Yay.
3350210	3351090	It's my present.
3351710	3352050	Episode 500.
3352310	3354411	And I quit.
3354812	3355272	I quit.
3357733	3357953	No.
3358273	3359694	See if somebody quits on episode 500.
3360374	3361955	That alone is worth tuning in for.
3362215	3363815	No, but I should have a diva breakdown.
3364156	3365176	It's about time for me to have one.
3365501	3366062	Rumble U No, Rumble Me
3392611	3396237	I'm sorry, but the system is the Wii U, not the Wii Me.
3396798	3398140	Because Wii Me would be really weird.
3398160	3399162	That's what I call my cat.
3399362	3405793	If you want Pokemon to rumble you, you have issues of fandom beyond anything that DarkSakura has for Garrus, I'm just saying.
3407000	3412701	You can make them rumble you if you want because they do sell some individual figures that go along with this game.
3412721	3413161	That's right.
3413321	3420303	It's going to be using the near field communication technology of the Wii U to whore this game like Skylanders.
3420663	3422043	The inevitable has happened.
3422143	3424144	They have said, hey, guess what?
3425044	3430385	There's a game that involves collectible figures and they're making money off these figures like crazy.
3430425	3430945	Well, I like money.
3431963	3432664	We like money.
3432724	3434025	Nintendo needs more money.
3434185	3435926	So that's what they're doing.
3436247	3437828	They're launching with seven figures.
3437868	3439809	Of course, one of those figures being Pikachu.
3439829	3442091	They're reasonably priced, I guess.
3442151	3444513	I guess 1,800 yen.
3447015	3449737	1,800 yen is the actual price of the game.
3450418	3451739	19 bucks, 20 bucks, whatever.
3452119	3454621	And the figures themselves are around 2 bucks or 200 yen.
3454962	3455622	So 2 bucks each.
3455942	3457724	However, if you look at those figures, you're like...
3457944	3458345	Pokemon Premium
3474483	3475965	It's evolved into more money!
3489571	3491433	Guitar Hero Meltdown phase.
3491533	3500344	I am really curious how retail stores are going to react to this because there's going to be a point, you know, there's already, like at the Target or Toys R Us, there's already like a Skylanders aisle.
3500724	3508273	So now it's going to, there's going to be Disney Infinity, there's going to be Pokemon, like there's going to come a point where the retailers are going to say, enough.
3509711	3510031	No more.
3510652	3510832	Yeah.
3511712	3514853	Or it's now a competition to see which one of these we're going to carry.
3515073	3517955	Or, here's a thought, and totally on speculation train.
3519535	3533141	You're seeing all these more physical item things so that sort of a bait and switch of going more digital for most things and then just having enough more retail presence things of things that are justifiable beyond bits.
3533686	3540674	hmm interesting just a thought interesting I mean a possible replacement for the software aisle in the future yeah oh my gosh
3541363	3550188	Here's my thing, is all the Pokemon that are included in this little pack or whatever, or the figures that they have available, they all look the same.
3551109	3561535	I mean, I'm serious, I don't know shit about Pokemon, and I'm not about to pretend that I do, but all of these Pokemon in this screenshot look exactly the same, except for color palette swaps or something like that.
3561615	3563836	I mean, it's just, they all look the same.
3564196	3571543	I just thought of a fun game for a future episode of OLR is that we'll show Loki pictures of various Pokemon and say, what do you think this one's called?
3571643	3575746	Fine, because I don't know.
3577697	3603390	it's all just multiple choice I'm pretty good at guessing seriously I'm not going to say that they're not going to make money from this because there's people like Shane that will buy anything that has to do with Pokemon so I'm not surprised and he will get other people to buy it too I'm sure he's super excited to hear that that Pokemon Pikachu system is coming out over here he was trying to convince me I needed one
3605748	3606629	He's your pusher, man.
3607050	3607630	I'm telling you.
3609172	3609933	So, yeah.
3611394	3612015	They're gonna try.
3612275	3614738	My thing is, I don't know if it's gonna be successful.
3615019	3616100	And the fact that, you know...
