7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, March 17th, 2013, Pokemon is finally set to answer Skylanders, the makers of Super Smash Brothers promised better online in the next game, and worlds collide between Resident Evil 6 and Leopard M2.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 497 for this March the 17th, 2013.
45000	51000	Happy St. Patrick's Day to you, or Happy Luigi Day as the case may be, cause you know, Luigi wears green.
51000	58000	Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, gamer lols, anything gamer, and maybe a little bit of other stuff too.
58000	65000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts. Say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
69000	73000	Jamie Summers has been replaced by a monster on tonight's show.
73000	77000	By one of those little gurgly things in WoW.
77000	79000	Oh, the murlocs?
81000	86000	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki, who ate a murloc for dinner.
86000	88000	I, yeah, sort of.
88000	89000	I helped.
89000	90000	How you doing Loki?
90000	93000	I'm doing fine, just making sure I'm being picked up on the mic.
93000	95000	Yes, your mic is good.
95000	96000	Alright.
96000	98000	I don't know what that was about. Random.
98000	104000	That was Pope Francis actually intervening and hoping that you wouldn't be heard tonight.
104000	107000	You're gonna be still trying to get rid of that old Pope smell.
107000	112000	Anyhow, say hello. We have a special guest joining us tonight in studio.
112000	117000	I want to give a big hello and welcome back to an old friend of Orange Lounge Radio, who I haven't seen in a couple months.
117000	123000	So I'm super excited he took the drive all the way from the Bay Area just to be here with us tonight.
123000	125000	Say hello to Seg.
125000	128000	Hello OLR, I missed you so.
128000	130000	I missed you too.
130000	131000	Would you buy me?
131000	132000	I'm just kidding.
134000	136000	How are you?
136000	139000	Oh, what a year.
139000	141000	You've had a very interesting year.
141000	147000	Yes, very much so. A lot of changes, a lot of good things and a lot of not so good things.
147000	151000	Not dead yet, despite the universe's best efforts.
151000	154000	And it's going to be an exciting year coming up.
154000	156000	Well, let me talk to you a little bit more in just a minute here.
156000	161000	But I do want to give a plug for our chat room because some of the folks live tonight might want to chat with you, Seg.
161000	166000	And they can do so by joining our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
166000	168000	In case you didn't know, it is a live show.
168000	175000	It's a podcast too, but we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network,
175000	180000	vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show every Sunday night.
180000	186000	And if you are in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, you can ask Seg some questions.
187000	192000	But not everybody might know, like, what y'all have been involved with in the gaming universe.
192000	196000	So tell us a little bit about yourself for the listeners that might not know.
196000	199000	So I make video games with computers.
199000	202000	That's good, as opposed to with sticks and stones.
202000	209000	Yes. First recipient, just to TLDR my history, first recipient of Bachelor of Fine Arts.
209000	211000	Make sure you're right in that mic so you're good and loud.
212000	218000	First recipient of Bachelor of Fine Arts in New Media at Emerson College in Boston, originally from Detroit, Dearborn.
218000	224000	Worked for over five years at Telltale Games, making over 60 titles, more or less.
224000	227000	Episodes are weird.
227000	236000	I also co-founded UMLoud, which is a rock band charity concert in San Francisco and broadcasted around the world for Child's Play Charity.
236000	238000	And stuff.
240000	243000	And other things. Is that enough?
243000	245000	No, it's perfect. That's lots of stuff.
245000	249000	Well, we talk about UMLoud. Let's start with UMLoud, because we've talked a lot about UMLoud on the show.
249000	252000	And, you know, we've all participated. We've gone to past events and so forth.
252000	257000	You know, it's a great thing that the whole, you know, Northern California community really gets involved with.
257000	261000	And now, really, the world, too.
261000	267000	Have you been surprised in a positive way at how well UMLoud's been received?
267000	273000	It's, you know, it's been, it's such a crazy journey, this thing.
273000	286000	Because, I mean, I first, I was actually one of the first to play Guitar Hero, because I play-tested Guitar Hero 1 way back in the day in Central Square.
287000	293000	And I always wanted to see an event that focused on performance rather than score.
293000	298000	Because the score didn't really interest me too much, so much as the performance aspect.
298000	312000	And, you know, a few years when I moved over here to California, the opportunity arose to really make an event that focused on performance.
312000	317000	And to do so in a way that benefited the community.
317000	325000	And I knew people wanted this sort of event once they figured out, you know, once we were able to communicate this isn't a score-based event.
325000	331000	Because when you use score, it's always like, oh, there's that one person that's crazy good that'll never beat.
331000	334000	And it just, would just shut off many people.
334000	341000	Whereas for our event, with the exception of the Headliner program, which is something a little bit special, we don't audition or anything.
342000	344000	Literally any idiot can do it.
344000	345000	Yes.
345000	347000	That's the beauty of the internet.
347000	355000	And it's just, you know, the first year, we had a few bands that actually did the costume stuff and all that, but that was just the first time doing it.
355000	363000	And now it's just, it's a thing. People pitch me band ideas and all this.
363000	366000	And just the amount of talent that comes out of it.
366000	374000	And just the creativity and the fervor of excitement that comes out of I Joomloud is just absolutely amazing.
374000	385000	And it wouldn't happen if it weren't for the amazing year-round team that helps put on this show together.
385000	389000	Literally, I mean, it is not just me.
389000	391000	I hate it when people are like, oh, it's your thing.
391000	394000	Like, no, no, no, no, no, it's not my thing.
394000	397000	It is our thing.
397000	401000	And, you know, we've been able to raise quite a bit of money.
401000	402000	How much did you pull in this last year?
402000	408000	This last year, we're looking, it's around $41,000 this time around.
408000	410000	Yeah, I remember it was about $40,000, yeah.
410000	413000	Yeah, we got a few things also rolled in late.
413000	415000	So it's about $41,000.
415000	416000	Not a bad chunk of change.
416000	418000	Not bad. Not bad at all.
418000	419000	That's for a great cause too.
419000	423000	It's fun to walk on.
423000	427000	Jamie, of course, you know, I know did a lot of graphic design and stuff for it.
427000	430000	So, yeah, it's a fun way for everybody to get involved.
430000	435000	Do you have a lot of people that are kind of throwing themselves at you going, let me help?
435000	440000	Yeah, you know, once we get, you know, we're definitely going to be expanding more this year.
440000	447000	We really want to expand the headliner program, which was a wild success this year.
447000	451000	To explain what that is, so Umlaut to Perform, it's a donation.
451000	458000	Last year was $200 last year for a band package.
458000	460000	And you split that between your band members.
460000	462000	So it's not that much at all.
462000	466000	It's $200 a band, but if your band has, what, seven people, three vocalists?
466000	475000	Yeah, you know, we have an upper limit of seven just to help manage the stuff, you know, the cards and all that and all that.
475000	477000	But it's, it doesn't have to be seven.
477000	479000	So you can't be like Gwar, getting up and having a big cup.
479000	481000	Well, you can't be, well, you know, there's a stage limit as well.
481000	487000	But, well, like one of the bands, this is one of the headliners, French Kiss,
487000	493000	incorporated other friends that had confetti poppers everywhere.
493000	498000	And we earned our cleaning fee this year with them.
498000	502000	Oh, man, just confetti everywhere.
502000	506000	How's the response from the people who can't be there in person?
506000	508000	Have you found that your internet presence has really grown?
508000	513000	We had a real boon with a partnership with Twitch.
513000	516000	They featured us on the website and that just shot up.
516000	520000	And also with Tim Schafer hosting was definitely an attraction.
520000	525000	How did you, that's, thank you for reminding me of that because that was quite the feature for Umlaut this year.
525000	527000	How did you manage that?
527000	532000	Well, Joe had already worked with Tim Schafer and his team, Joe Market.
532000	537000	He's one of the co-founders, one of the fellow co-founders and board members.
537000	543000	And he had already worked with him on the GDC awards and all that.
543000	548000	And we were looking for a host and he did the co-found.
548000	550000	Hey, would you be interested in this?
550000	555000	And they were, you know, he was, and we had him host our show.
555000	556000	Awesome.
556000	557000	Yeah.
557000	567000	I mean, we kept that under wraps for quite a few months because we wanted it to be Tim Schafer's hosting and here's where you buy tickets.
567000	573000	Here's a great question for somebody that's been in the industry as long as you have since you brought up keeping secrets.
573000	579000	And you've worked, you know, you worked for Telltale for many years and obviously they had some huge games over those years.
579000	581000	You have to keep a lot of secrets when you work in this industry.
581000	582000	How hard is that?
582000	583000	Very.
583000	594000	The worst, the hardest secret I ever had to keep was keeping from my sister, Carolyn, the fact that we were working on Tales of Monkey Island.
594000	603000	That was the hardest because my sister and I grew up on the scum era and I leaned more towards the Sam and Max.
603000	605000	She leaned more towards the Monkey Island side.
605000	610000	But, you know, there's definitely shared love between the two.
610000	618000	But I had to keep that secret for much longer than I would have liked.
618000	622000	And I certainly heard about it from her.
622000	624000	I bet. I bet.
624000	632000	I told her a half hour before we were going live with the announcement just so I could say that I told her before.
632000	637000	But if you guys have 30 minutes before, that's great.
637000	638000	Yeah.
638000	644000	If you guys have questions for SEG, live.vognetwork.com, you can ask whatever you'd like, within reason.
644000	649000	Either about UMLOUD or A Space Between Studios or whatever.
649000	654000	I do want to talk about your new studio, but I had another quick question about UMLOUD because I know this has got to be something that's on your mind.
654000	656000	It's on a lot of people's mind when it comes to rock band.
656000	660000	They've announced no more DLC after, what is it, two weeks?
660000	662000	It's like the last DLC we're ever going to see.
662000	666000	Which, you know, the end had to happen at some point, right?
666000	673000	It's hard to be upset about the end of rock band DLC when no other game in the history of gaming has been supported the way the rock band has been.
673000	674000	Yeah, five years.
674000	675000	Let's be real.
675000	677000	And with as much as they've got, right?
677000	685000	So, are you worried, though, that like, uh-oh, if this means that rock band is sunsetting, what's going to happen to UMLOUD?
685000	694000	Well, you know, this whole shinding does not happen if not for the support of the community.
694000	698000	And that's ultimately what everyone comes together for.
698000	703000	That's what this whole thing happens, is the community.
703000	711000	And I see no slowing down from the community of wanting to do this event.
711000	717000	So, that's what I point to, not just to blindly say, oh, yeah, we're still going to do it.
717000	724000	No, the evidence of all the people that just want to pour in all the performances who just...
724000	736000	To me, our marketing challenge for our event is getting people to experience for the first time UMLOUD, whether it's online or in person.
736000	743000	Because we know that once people experience it, they're coming back next year or really heavily regretting it.
743000	748000	So, we know we have a very good event on our hands.
748000	751000	We know we have an event that people love, that people want to participate in.
751000	759000	And harmonics moving on from rock band hasn't altered that.
759000	763000	So, maybe it'll be a dance party with Dance Central in a couple years.
764000	766000	Surely you've kicked that idea around.
766000	768000	We've kicked the idea, yeah.
768000	770000	Obvious conclusion, right?
770000	775000	I mean, it's hard to do that on stage because, well, for one, it's only two people.
775000	778000	And then it's not a main stage thing.
778000	785000	And we really want to push as many bands and people on stage just because we're only doing it one night.
785000	790000	We want to make sure that we get as many people to experience the big stage.
790000	793000	It really is the performance of it all, too.
793000	797000	And it's funny that if you look back at the history of this show, we started around, what, DDR?
797000	801000	We used to do episodes of this show live from Dance Dance Revolution tournaments and stuff.
801000	808000	So, let me tell you, they'll always be somewhere in gaming, like a performance game.
808000	810000	I think we've seen that ever since, really.
810000	812000	I guess DDR probably was the first of that that I could think of.
812000	814000	It was a performance-based game.
814000	816000	I want to see a visual K-themed band next year.
816000	819000	That's my personal challenge out to anybody, by the way.
819000	821000	Anything is possible.
821000	826000	I try not to meddle in the affairs of bands, but I just want to put out there,
826000	832000	I would love to see someone do a mash-up and or a Weird Al rendition of a song.
832000	842000	Because the game's on no-fail, and you don't worry about score anyways.
842000	846000	I wish people would explore the space.
846000	848000	That's what we do at my house.
848000	852000	Yeah, I've seen people do, because Born This Way, right?
852000	854000	So you can do the whole, like, perform this way.
854000	855000	You can totally do it.
855000	857000	It's good times.
857000	859000	Isn't Lola in there?
859000	861000	Because I think we've done Yoda.
861000	863000	Perhaps.
863000	865000	What else do I want to ask about?
865000	869000	Oh, one other question I got about Umlaut, and then I want to talk about some of your other projects, too.
869000	873000	Do you get people, since you have had success on the internet,
873000	879000	and you're recognized on Twitch as a national thing now, it's not just something that's NorCal,
879000	881000	do you get people coming to you going,
881000	885000	Segg, how do I have an Umlaut in Tallahassee, Florida?
885000	888000	Or how do I do an Umlaut in Titicaca?
888000	890000	There's definitely a request for that.
890000	892000	Bring Umlaut to me.
892000	894000	There's sort of two prongs to that answer.
895000	903000	As far as the Umlaut branding, we don't know exactly how to, for us under the Umlaut brand,
903000	915000	to franchise and do it in such a way that we can ensure that the quality and the organization is up to our standards
915000	918000	to make sure that things are above orders.
919000	925000	It's not that I imagine people being shady about it, but it's not something we can just go,
925000	928000	Oh, yeah, I'll use the Umlaut brand and all that.
928000	936000	So we're protective on it because we want to make sure we do it right if we branch out with the Umlaut brand.
936000	940000	But not like you need us, either.
941000	950000	It all comes down to, do you have enough people and enough partnerships you can start to make a thing together
950000	953000	and to rent out a place?
953000	958000	And if you have enough of a community around to pull out the rock band and make it happen.
962000	966000	It's more event planning than the rock band part because, believe me,
966000	973000	as the sound techs at DNA Lounge, where we have our event, have told me we're one of the easier shows to tech.
974000	975000	I bet.
975000	980000	Yeah, it's microphones and looped back and the monitors, but the rest of the instruments.
980000	982000	That part's the easiest, right?
982000	986000	Well, yeah, and you know, it's funny because we get this, even here at Orange Ons Radio,
986000	988000	we're coming up on our 500th episode in a few weeks, right?
988000	993000	So a lot of people are like, Hey, you guys should have an OLR Con or a VoG network to do a VoG Con or something like that.
993000	999000	I'm like, do you know what it takes to plan a convention?
999000	1001000	It would not be pretty.
1001000	1005000	Like the better idea is to take it like Fonami.
1005000	1007000	Hey, don't you want like an OLR night or something?
1007000	1008000	Yeah.
1008000	1010000	Try to leash on to something else.
1010000	1011000	That's the only way it's going to happen.
1011000	1018000	I think part of a first gen con, its first ever, it was called Ground Zero Con in Mobile, Alabama.
1018000	1020000	It was held in.
1020000	1022000	It's Christmas at Ground Zero.
1022000	1024000	No, not that one.
1024000	1028000	It was, my friend had this like gaming group called Ground Zero Techno Mage.
1028000	1029000	Okay.
1029000	1037000	And he ran a con in the theater room in the school's student center.
1037000	1041000	But everything's got to start somewhere. It'd be little, but you know, it's possible.
1041000	1042000	Yeah.
1042000	1043000	I think he started it with 200 bucks.
1043000	1051000	The proto umlaut was actually Fuendrauser, which was in a bar, 200 capacity.
1051000	1052000	Yeah.
1052000	1055000	And I didn't get involved, but I went to it and that packed the place up.
1055000	1063000	And that's like, okay, if they have advertising able to get that many people rolling in, and then it was a scale up from there.
1063000	1070000	If that was all umlaut ever was, now obviously it's turned into something bigger, but even if it's just that, you're still raising money for a good cause.
1070000	1071000	Exactly.
1071000	1076000	So why not, why not dream a little bigger?
1076000	1077000	All right.
1077000	1080000	Speaking of dream big, you started your own game studio.
1080000	1081000	Yeah.
1081000	1082000	Okay.
1082000	1083000	No pressure.
1083000	1084000	Okay.
1084000	1087000	You were at Telltale.
1087000	1089000	Layoffs happen in the industry.
1089000	1092000	It doesn't matter who you work for, right?
1092000	1094000	These types of things happen.
1094000	1098000	So you worked on, did you work on Walking Dead?
1098000	1099000	Yes.
1099000	1103000	So that's got to feel real good though, that you were a part of that because that was such a huge success, right?
1103000	1104000	Yeah.
1104000	1130000	Working through the years and building up the studio and really having all of us really come to a point where we're really recognized for our work is just a testament to the years of dedication we all put in to make that go.
1130000	1134000	So, you know, there's that old saying, when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade.
1134000	1141000	So you certainly have done that in some regard with this whole thing because, you know, unfortunately you took that bad news that happened there.
1141000	1148000	And you know, that's just an inevitable fact of that industry, unfortunately, is that, you know, as projects come and go, people come and go, right?
1148000	1149000	We've reported it.
1149000	1151000	How many times on this show?
1151000	1152000	How many times on this show?
1152000	1156000	But here we are now, you know, that'll happen at the end of last year.
1156000	1158000	And now here we are March of this year.
1158000	1162000	And you're like, okay, I'm not going to be the type that just sits on my butt and watches Oprah all day.
1162000	1164000	I'm going to.
1164000	1165000	Oprah's off the air.
1165000	1168000	She has a network now.
1168000	1174000	What's the line when life gives you lemons, you demand to see life's manager.
1174000	1175000	But you've turned that into a game studio.
1175000	1181000	So where how did that did you just did you wake up one day and go, you know, I should start a game studio.
1181000	1188000	Well, I should really talk more about the project and, you know, the studio kind of comes after that a little bit.
1188000	1198000	And I wanted to, you know, after the layoff, I was thinking of why why I love video games so much.
1198000	1205000	Why why I've dedicated my my life, my career to video games and all that.
1205000	1219000	And I've I've had this idea floating around of making a a a project that explained how video games communicate as an art form.
1219000	1230000	And it's you know, I mean, I went through school for it and actually kind of made my own curriculum because I was the first person to go through my program.
1230000	1251000	And there's a lot of things that we know, but no one, you know, very few have really pinned it down, put some definitions onto it, put some context on it and delivered in a way that a general public would actually participate, you know, like play playthrough and all that.
1251000	1258000	So I wanted to make a video game, a video games, trying to wrap my head around this idea a lot.
1258000	1265000	I know we talk about like artistic video games. We think a lot about like Flower and Journey and other things that that game company have done.
1265000	1270000	The art in that maybe even like so much the art of storytelling in a game like Walking Dead.
1270000	1272000	Certainly it affected a lot of people and it's storytelling.
1272000	1278000	So what's what's the difference between like a artsy video game? Because that's not what you're talking about.
1278000	1280000	You're not talking about making an artsy video game.
1280000	1284000	You're talking about making a video game that tell like.
1285000	1299000	I'm trying to wrap my head. Well, think of think, you know, in high school or in college, you know, there are film appreciation classes like a film appreciation one on one class where, you know, that class you're walking in there.
1299000	1318000	You know, there's it's not like you haven't experienced film before, but those classes are to bring some terminology and some understanding and perspective about how artists use this particular form of media to communicate ideas.
1318000	1322000	I want to make the video games appreciation one on one class.
1322000	1332000	And rather than making it a book where I would be going like, oh, this concept, like in this game, assuming you played that game.
1332000	1340000	But if you're going in for a video game appreciation textbook, you know, you can assume that they haven't played that particular game.
1340000	1347000	So rather, I wanted to make a game. So instead of just textually writing about it and talking about it and all that, it's like, no, here is the concept.
1347000	1354000	Let's put it out in front of you. Let's have you experience it the way it's intended to in that form of media.
1354000	1360000	So you can actually really get a deep understanding by doing rather than wrote.
1360000	1363000	So this is the game that will make Roger Ebert understand.
1363000	1375000	Yeah, you know, I'm trying not. Well, I will say that I'm not the piece won't spend much time of, you know, trying to prove, you know, answer the question, is video games art?
1375000	1378000	Because it's just simply, yes, they are. Let's move on.
1378000	1387000	That's that's that's the opinionated opinion I'm starting with this piece of just like, yes, there are. Let's go into it.
1387000	1394000	So you know, you know, the result you want. How do you how we how are we going to get there?
1394000	1397000	Good question.
1397000	1408000	So I have a few people that are working on it sort of part time and part part time on it.
1408000	1417000	I have Jessica Johnson being a writer for me and being sort of the foil and keeping me into focus of the actual content of it.
1417000	1424000	I have Dan as a programmer that's very interested in working with me on the project.
1424000	1428000	But really, it comes down to is funding, to be quite honest.
1428000	1434000	And the bugger about this kind of project is I usually when you go out for funding for a game and all that,
1434000	1445000	when you're doing it professionally, air quotes, is that you say, well, here's similar games that we're trying to make.
1445000	1452000	And here was their return on investment. Here's where their profitability and here's where we're going to twist and make something different.
1452000	1458000	I don't have any game to point to that is anywhere similar to this.
1458000	1467000	No one has made the real the video game about video games to the kind of depth and length that I'm searching for with this piece.
1467000	1471000	So it turns me to do the inevitable Kickstarter.
1471000	1475000	I was going to ask because, yeah, we like a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to ask you.
1475000	1479000	But now that we're in 2013, is Kickstarter the answer for this?
1479000	1481000	That currently is my answer.
1481000	1483000	Or Indiegogo or any of those.
1483000	1494000	I'm doing Kickstarter because I want to if I'm doing this, I want to do it in a way that actually funds the game.
1494000	1505000	And that's going to be six figures easy because I want to respect the people that are going to work on this for me.
1505000	1507000	And that means paying them decently.
1508000	1510000	So it ends up being a six figure.
1510000	1518000	The figure and Indiegogo is just not producing those kinds of adult results consistently.
1518000	1525000	There is a branding of Kickstarter that you can't dismiss.
1525000	1533000	I mean, sure, I would love to have, you know, some capital investment come in, swoop down and make it go.
1533000	1539000	But barring that, I really need to prove that there's an audience for this.
1539000	1546000	And really the available way to do that in this case, I believe, is through Kickstarter.
1546000	1553000	Because then I can say here are these people who actually put money down to that actually want to have this thing happen.
1553000	1556000	How are you how are you preparing for this Kickstarter?
1556000	1561000	So, you know, it's a lot of, you know, this budget for one.
1561000	1565000	I have a spreadsheet that is so dynamic.
1565000	1568000	Well, thank God you've had to do some financial planning for UMLoud in the past.
1568000	1570000	Yeah, I know, right?
1570000	1571000	You're not going into this totally blind.
1571000	1572000	Yeah.
1572000	1580000	You know, I have quite a bit of experience of doing budgets and all that.
1580000	1589000	And I have to say that I've had a really good business teacher and that's my father or Uncle Ed to you.
1589000	1590000	Hi, Dad.
1591000	1592000	I think I see him in chat.
1592000	1593000	Yeah.
1593000	1600000	He had a comment earlier in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com about Tim Schafer at UMLoud and that he was a great addition to UMLoud this year.
1600000	1604000	And Uncle Ed is a great addition to UMLoud.
1604000	1609000	He does the books and everything, among many other things.
1609000	1616000	But anyway, but he is a former Ford employee.
1616000	1627000	And I learned I learned enough about business to go about knowing enough about business to know when I need an adult.
1627000	1646000	And which, man, that's a bit, you know, through the years, really realizing how special and unique that is, because, boy, we all have seen people who really don't know how to business and don't understand for themselves.
1646000	1647000	Heck yeah.
1647000	1651000	There's been so many moments during the times of OLR in the past where, you know, we're trying to do something.
1651000	1655000	It's like, I need an adult.
1656000	1671000	So, you know, I'm not going in this completely blindly, but so that, you know, there's making the budget and figure out, OK, how much you know, how much is needed, what is going to be the markup of Kickstarter fees and credit card fees and all that.
1671000	1684000	And then the fulfillment fees of the actual prizes and all that, that run down from how much is bandwidth going to cost to deliver on final thing to all the physical items, what's good, what's not good.
1684000	1699000	You know, and trying to balancing all those numbers so that if this thing gets green lighted, I'm not going, well, I have these thousands of dollars worth of stuff I have to pay for in order to get to people.
1699000	1700000	Well, crap.
1701000	1709000	You may not have the answer to this question yet, but let me try to throw it out there anyway, just because this is the question that people will be asking once this goes live.
1709000	1713000	But, you know, why am I going to want to donate to this?
1713000	1719000	Why will I want to donate and help space between studios create this game?
1719000	1742000	What this game is intending to do is be the community's way of illustrating to the rest of the world why video games, why we love video games in the way and why we think video games is unique as a form of art that communicates ideas.
1742000	1757000	And to answer that in the way of what makes video games work to communicate ideas, why are we attracted to the things that we like about video games?
1757000	1761000	Why are we dissuade about the things that don't work about video games?
1761000	1767000	Will you be able to answer the question why we've been sitting here for the past 11 years every Sunday night talking about this crap?
1767000	1770000	Well, you know, that's more in the psychology.
1770000	1777000	And that was the nice way of saying nobody can answer that.
1777000	1779000	That would be an exercise.
1779000	1782000	That would be a true exercise in recursive thinking.
1782000	1783000	I'm sorry.
1783000	1785000	He's a game designer, not a head doctor.
1785000	1789000	I didn't mean to make it about us.
1789000	1790000	It's about us.
1790000	1795000	It's on our show about that.
1795000	1799000	But no, this is this is this is also a piece.
1799000	1806000	I mean, we don't have this fully fleshed out as far as the outline, because I also want to hear from the community at large.
1806000	1822000	And this is development and players of what are the things about video games we would want to communicate to people who may not know or play video games all that well, but have an interest just to know more.
1822000	1834000	And not and I don't think throwing people to a particular any one particular game is going to begin to answer what the diaspora of video games are.
1834000	1846000	So this is going to be a piece that is a sort of neutral ground where it doesn't make an assumption of what experience level and what you've played before.
1846000	1849000	That's both in the not played before or super experience.
1849000	1857000	I'm not making initial assumptions of audience that way will customize based off of how you approach things.
1857000	1868000	We'll take those creative choices there, but really want to present something that that we can go, hey, oh, you want to know more about video games?
1868000	1873000	You just just get this game and play and then we'll talk about it after.
1873000	1878000	And if you really want to know, it's going to cost you because we hear gamers love microtransactions.
1878000	1883000	Oh, no, no, I'm not doing that now.
1883000	1885000	Yeah, I do.
1885000	1887000	Will your game be always online required?
1887000	1888000	No.
1888000	1889000	Get out now.
1889000	1890000	All right.
1890000	1895000	No, I, you know, well, I'll have the game that's DRM free.
1895000	1899000	Windows, Linux, Mac.
1899000	1901000	You know, no.
1901000	1903000	Is it coming to the OUYA?
1903000	1918000	Well, you know, that's the other plan, you know, other consoles and platforms and definitely not saying no to I'm sticking to the big three desktop platforms because I can 100 percent promise that 100 percent go and all that.
1918000	1923000	We are using Unity, so it's not gating other platforms outright.
1923000	1926000	It's just I'd rather promise things we can deliver on.
1926000	1931000	And it's not that I mean, there are other avenues that I am exploring.
1931000	1932000	Sure.
1932000	1935000	I just know that I want to promise.
1935000	1937000	Don't second, don't write checks.
1937000	1938000	Your ass can't cash.
1938000	1939000	Right. I heard that before.
1939000	1940000	All right.
1940000	1944000	It's not like I'm mentioning that Minecraft will be on a dot, dot, dot.
1944000	1950000	If I'm torn on whether to ask you this question or not, because this question can be perceived as a negative from our chat room.
1950000	1952000	But I think it's a tough question.
1952000	1953000	And I've been through worse.
1953000	1956000	I'm going to say if you're going to take it to the Internet, you're going to get this.
1956000	1957000	So let me ask you this question from Ross.
1957000	1961000	Do you see in the chat room that says so.
1961000	1966000	So this is a testament to the community's insecurity and need for approval.
1966000	1968000	Are gamers insecure?
1968000	1970000	Well, no, it's not it's not a statement.
1970000	1971000	I'm sorry.
1971000	1980000	It's not the impression of just gamers need to themselves need to like defend or whatever.
1980000	1988000	It's just there hasn't been a really good academic text that's approachable.
1988000	1990000	Could this be a celebration?
1990000	1991000	Yes.
1991000	1992000	Of gaming.
1992000	1993000	It's a celebration of gaming.
1993000	2001000	I mean, I'm making my pitch a little bit geared towards more of people who have played games, because I think if you're listening to this show, I can make that assumption.
2001000	2002000	That's that's a good.
2002000	2003000	Yeah.
2003000	2004000	Good way of thinking.
2004000	2005000	Yeah.
2005000	2006000	Just say it.
2006000	2007000	Just, you know, no judging.
2007000	2008000	But, you know.
2008000	2017000	Well, going back to the academic approach, though, what about having it as a tool for like, say, officials, you know, people who are making those legislation about.
2017000	2024000	Well, I don't want to I don't want the piece to become an out and out political tool.
2024000	2032000	I'm making very, very consciously not going into topical things or even current topics that I'm including.
2032000	2042000	Like, for example, I'm not going to touch behavior of online chat and XBLA and all that.
2042000	2045000	Comment threads on the Internet.
2045000	2048000	Because that's not there's nothing artistic.
2048000	2052000	Just keep Tumblr out of it because all anyone does is talk about Mass Effect.
2052000	2054000	But like, you know, like I'm bringing that up.
2054000	2057000	It's not even so much like this is a text of the community.
2057000	2059000	This is not a text.
2059000	2063000	This is just how video games communicate as an art form.
2063000	2086000	But to to that end, as tools, one of the plans I have for the the Kickstarter tier reward tiers is you get a digital copy, but you can pick a library classroom, whatever academic it's, you know, whatever can be leaving a little bit broad.
2086000	2092000	You know, some people if people come up with something that we haven't thought about that would fit in their community, community service, community service, whatever.
2092000	2103000	But a kit that's so far speccing us to physical DVDs, a site license documentation saying, yes, this institution has a site license for the game.
2103000	2115000	So it's not limited to the two physical copies and two physical copies of the softcover handbook that we're also going to produce as a sort of companion piece with it.
2115000	2126000	And that's a you know, you get the thing, but then you can send out a thing and that's going to be on the little on the little more upper range because that's an expensive share, you know, more expensive than a digitally downloadable thing.
2126000	2135000	But, you know, I am putting the cut ins for library in that educational text, but I'm also not trying to make this edutainment.
2135000	2140000	You know, this isn't just the pure academic. I'm trying to make I'm trying to take the approach.
2140000	2158000	This is actually more speaking to where I want to go in a studio perspective is I want to take my my approach of how I've approached all of these licensed properties and all that that I worked in and telltale and all that.
2158000	2167000	Where I take this canon from strong bad and, you know, it has it has this very well documented wiki, which was such a boon.
2167000	2187000	I have to say that the Homestar Wiki helped out so much by taking the approach and care I've done to all these fictional franchises and take that same approach, but to non fictional things where the canon is reality.
2188000	2201000	So and understanding video games is the piece that is my first piece in in that approach, because what I guess for the most part when it comes to edutainment or serious games,
2202000	2219000	I'm not trying to make a complete blanket statement, but it just there just seems to be this disconnect of all the all the rich development and decisions being made on fictional games that are wonderful and awesome.
2219000	2226000	But it's just not transferring over to other fields and other things that just that would really benefit from it.
2226000	2238000	And this is sort of my my particular answer to try and give the perspective of we don't necessarily need to do straight straight up fiction work with our art form.
2238000	2243000	Well, you've got quite quite a path ahead of you until you get to the end.
2243000	2247000	I do kind of want to wrap up so you move on, talk about the weekend news.
2247000	2254000	But if somebody wants to keep tabs on your project, on the Kickstarter, that'll be coming eventually, how can they do that?
2254000	2261000	Spacebetweenstudios.com and it has all the social media, blah, blah, blah.
2261000	2263000	The Twitters, the Facebooks.
2263000	2267000	The Twitters, the Facebooks, the Google Plus even, because why not?
2267000	2273000	And oh, no, Harrison's there?
2273000	2279000	What's up, Harrison? Sorry, I'm totally reading Chad and totally distracting myself. Damn you, Harrison.
2280000	2285000	It took us forever. We used to do the same thing. It would be like our show would be us reading the chat.
2285000	2289000	Yeah, well, I'm just seeing and Bobby going Harrison.
2289000	2296000	I would actually love SAG because there are there is kind of like a spirited debate going on about, you know, what what is what is the purpose of this?
2296000	2303000	So I would love for you to get actually read your chat room after after we're done talking here and we get into the news.
2303000	2309000	But so Spacebetweenstudios.com and on the Twitters and all that stuff.
2309000	2315000	I know this is probably so early, but I'd be made fun of if I didn't ask this as a commentator.
2315000	2320000	Any idea on the time frame? Any time, time assuming Green Line and everything.
2320000	2328000	If if the Kickstarter passes, passes and I'm able to be solvent on that, I'm currently looking at it.
2328000	2339000	Well, it'd be ambitious if I said December 2014, but it's probably going to be January 2015 for digital release.
2339000	2348000	And I'm purposefully putting a two month block of the physical releases of stuff because I want to make sure things are.
2348000	2353000	Completely bug free.
2353000	2362000	Before I meant the final physical disks or anything, but everyone would get the digital when it's, you know, I'm not spinning hairs there.
2362000	2365000	Well, good luck.
2365000	2367000	I'll need it.
2367000	2372000	I, I, I, I am so I just want to I can't wait to just see it.
2372000	2375000	You know what I mean? Like, it's it's one thing to kind of hear you describe it.
2375000	2381000	And then I'm kind of like, I just can't wait to kind of like jumping because there is so, you know, when you think about it, less like a celebration.
2381000	2383000	I mean, you know what we're talking about here.
2383000	2390000	I mean, this this show, my life would be dramatically different if video games didn't exist.
2390000	2394000	Right. And, you know, I'm sure we all have that story of mom growing up saying you keep playing those games.
2394000	2398000	You'll never amount to anything. Isn't that right, Uncle Ed?
2398000	2406000	Now, well, video video games have helped you raise over the years, probably one hundred thousand dollars at this point for charity.
2406000	2410000	Right. Over the five. We're at 40.
2410000	2413000	OK, well, it's about I'm going to say 80K.
2413000	2416000	I mean, regardless, a huge number.
2416000	2421000	And that is because of your love of video games, our love for video games.
2421000	2433000	You know, wanting to perform that, wanting to, you know, show the community gamers aren't just crazy people on Xbox with guns that shoot children.
2433000	2436000	You know, that's not what gamers are at all.
2436000	2439000	The the one point I do want to make and then we can actually continue on.
2440000	2448000	When with the Kickstarter and all that, I I am and you can you can you can hold me to the fire in this.
2448000	2454000	You when we go into development with this, you are going to hear from us constantly.
2454000	2461000	We're going to make sure we do at least once a month general like, you know, what what we did in the past month thing.
2461000	2464000	But it's also trying to be available in forums and all that.
2464000	2472000	So we're not going to be one of those kickstarters that, like, don't say anything for a few months and everyone's like, ah.
2472000	2480000	You know, so we and this piece won't exist if it won't if the community doesn't participate with it.
2480000	2489000	So, you know, this isn't I mean, also, you know, yes, ultimately we make final decisions with the piece, but it is not going to be in a vacuum.
2489000	2493000	It is going to need everyone else's participation.
2493000	2496000	I love these comments in the chat room. I've got I've got to read these before we move on.
2496000	2498000	I haven't been looking. Sorry, John.
2498000	2504000	Harrison Pink in our chat room, H.G. Pink says, everyone back say he's a smart guy who loves games and won't steal from you.
2504000	2506000	Oh, thank you, Harrison. I miss you, man.
2506000	2511000	Uncle Ed just defending himself a little bit in chat. So I think it's fair to read this.
2511000	2515000	I gave you the TRS 80 in the early 80s. Your mother's the one that had issues with it.
2515000	2519000	That's why I was saying like that. That was like that's why I met with that comment.
2519000	2523000	Is that right? That mom said that Uncle Ed.
2523000	2525000	Fair enough. Fair enough. All right.
2525000	2534000	Well, again, best of luck to you, not just with Space Between Studios, but with UMLoud, you know, going into this year and whatever else may come.
2534000	2536000	You will be a PAX East as an attendee.
2536000	2543000	I am a crazy person because I'm doing PAX this week.
2543000	2547000	We leave hopefully Tuesday. Apparently this is going to be fun time weather, so we'll see.
2547000	2551000	But Tuesday, Sin and I will be going to Boston.
2551000	2561000	And it's bless Sin, her birthday is Wednesday and I'm throwing her a birthday party in Boston to which she knows no one there.
2561000	2564000	She has never met anyone there because she doesn't know anyone in Boston.
2564000	2570000	There's one friend from her from here that's also coming along with like everyone else is like, meet my friends.
2570000	2572000	Parties with strangers can be the best kind.
2572000	2577000	Yes, they can. But so so I'll be at PAX this weekend.
2577000	2584000	I think I make it make a sign that says, ask me about video games and park myself somewhere and see what happens.
2584000	2589000	Why not? Yeah, exactly. It works for the free hugs guy. I know. Right.
2589000	2595000	And then you're going to GDC and then GDC because I'm I'm a crazy person and I get back the Monday.
2595000	2599000	I mean, GDC starts Monday, but I have the Wednesday through Friday pass.
2599000	2601000	But apparently there's stuff I can go to on the Tuesday.
2601000	2607000	So I'm going to go to the it's like the Facebook day and the Google day.
2607000	2612000	It's all these sponsored ones and I figured, hey, with Pocky, come equipped with Pocky.
2612000	2616000	Why? You are right. Free candy.
2616000	2619000	You can be a stranger with candy. Yes.
2619000	2626000	OK, so and by the way, just, you know, Uncle Ed said in chat, ouch, she just hit me.
2626000	2631000	There you go. That's that's hilarious. Well, have fun at PAX East, have fun at GDC.
2631000	2635000	So apparently, if the listeners want to say hi to you at PAX East, talk to you in person about this.
2635000	2640000	Look for the guy who has the sign that says, ask me about video games.
2640000	2645000	Perfect. I'm sure at some point you will find the VOG contingent, Bobby Blackwell.
2645000	2650000	I'm sure they'll find me. They'll find you. Absolutely. Absolutely. Let's be realistic here.
2650000	2655000	There is a social media that I think you should add to the list. Tumblr.
2655000	2660000	Oh, God. Oh, oh, there is much wank on Tumblr, but much spreading of information.
2660000	2666000	Don't I'm not hating on Tumblr. I'm not I would never want to incur that wrath.
2666000	2670000	But Tumblr is almost all social media for Tumblr. Tumblr is a very interesting place.
2670000	2676000	I love the gifts. Yeah, there's a few people I thought friends that I follow on on the Tumblr.
2676000	2681000	I do not have a Tumblr. I say thanks again for being here tonight.
2681000	2686000	And you will stay and talk about the week in news. Of course, because I have opinions.
2686000	2691000	Excellent. All right. So let's talk about our gaming week. So we'll move a little quickly tonight because we are.
2691000	2696000	Because I talk forever. You know what? You know what?
2696000	2701000	You earned it. All right. Dark soccer. How was your game? What the crap else do I play?
2701000	2706000	Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. Because I was actually playing around with modding Mass Effect 2.
2706000	2711000	I love that that BioWare is like, yeah, go ahead. Mod it all you want. E a patch.
2711000	2719000	Damn it. So, yeah, I've been playing a lot of a lot more Mass Effect and a little bit more to the moon.
2719000	2724000	Because that game is absolutely. Just it causes the feels to happen.
2724000	2731000	It makes the feels happen and they hurt. And then I've been looking at a few other things.
2731000	2736000	But honestly, my job right now is going to the gym and looking for a job.
2736000	2741000	So. Yeah, that's about it. Well, then we'll move on to Loki.
2741000	2747000	How was your gaming week? Actually, I've been playing a ton of Saints Row the third, ironically enough.
2747000	2755000	And so I started playing again with my coworker, which probably getting that pretty soon because he's leaving.
2755000	2764000	We've been playing co-op on 360 with the full package and actually haven't really been playing a DLC because it sucks.
2764000	2769000	But main game. And so we've been messing around with that a little bit.
2769000	2774000	And then on PC, I, you know, finally got my car.
2774000	2781000	Well, I had my copy since that THQ sale on the humble indie bundle, THQ bundle.
2781000	2786000	And so I've been playing a heavily modded version of the game,
2786000	2792000	mainly just so I get the additional cheat that was actually missing from the console version, which was the evil car code.
2792000	2798000	I love the evil car code from the other games. And I was really sad when it wasn't in Saints Row the third.
2798000	2806000	But apparently there was a lot of rushing on that game. And so a lot of the features that they would have put in there got cut.
2806000	2811000	So I've been playing with that and having actually quite a bit of fun with it.
2811000	2815000	And going through and just trying to get all my achievements and stuff on the Steam version.
2815000	2820000	And hopefully going to do the same on the console version because I've been trying to finish missions differently.
2820000	2824000	Because I lost my save that I had. I had an in-game save with almost everything done.
2824000	2828000	And sure enough, I don't know where it is. So.
2828000	2831000	You need to save your games in the cloud.
2831000	2835000	Oh, fuck that. I am not saving shit in the cloud.
2837000	2844000	But clearly gamers want their saves in the cloud because they keep losing them.
2844000	2848000	That's what gamers want. We're hearing gamers loud and clear on what they want.
2848000	2852000	In the cloud. You know what I used to call the cloud? The internet!
2852000	2857000	That's what it is. It's a fucking internet, okay? You're saving it to a server somewhere else, okay?
2857000	2862000	Why would I want to do that when I can just save it to a memory card that I know where the fuck it is?
2862000	2867000	Oh, and hey, if the internet's down, guess what? My save still works because it's on a memory card.
2867000	2872000	And not in the fucking cloud. So, no, I'm fine not saving to the cloud.
2872000	2878000	Although I do have one cloud save right now. It's my old Minecraft save for Xbox Live Arcade.
2878000	2881000	I actually agree with you. I turn off all of my cloud storage stuff.
2881000	2885000	I am thinking about taking it out because I hate having the second option pop up all the time for saves.
2885000	2888000	I turn it on. It's not hurting anything.
2888000	2892000	What I don't like about it is that sometimes it overwrites some of my save files on Mass Effect.
2892000	2894000	Oh, well, I can see that.
2894000	2899000	So, yeah, I've been playing that and then a little Call of Duty. I'm still, you know, playing Call of Duty.
2901000	2904000	If that's it, then Seg, how about you? What have you been playing?
2904000	2907000	What do you play when you're not designing and all this other stuff?
2907000	2909000	And moving, because I also moved.
2909000	2914000	I've been slowly getting back to Team Fortress 2.
2914000	2917000	I say as I wear my Mann Co. shirt.
2917000	2926000	And I used to play on 242 Furious, which is just a crazy server.
2926000	2929000	But Floormaster, I guess, closed it down. I don't know what happened there.
2929000	2934000	So, I'm trying to find a new permanent home for a server. So, I'm shopping around there.
2934000	2936000	Any Team Fortress players want to adopt a Seg?
2936000	2949000	Yes, I have. So, it's funny when I play Team Fortress 2, because I have the rarest, most sought-after item that wasn't the gold wrench in TF2.
2949000	2959000	I have a self-made Max hat, because everyone that was working on Telltale at the time, when we were releasing Season 3 of Sam and Max,
2960000	2966000	we all got the self-made Max hat, so it sparkles, because I'm fabulous.
2969000	2971000	That was my role on this show.
2972000	2974000	You've just been out-fabbed.
2976000	2979000	And it's funny, because I'll play, and then someone will go like,
2979000	2983000	Dude, there's someone with the self-made. And we're like, dude, why is your hat sparkling?
2983000	2986000	Or, dude, can I trade for your hat?
2987000	2993000	Yes, random internet stranger. I am going to trade the most rarest hat ever to...
2993000	2997000	I'm going to assume they just don't know how rare it is, or something. I don't know.
2997000	3000000	The ones that asked do. And they're that dumb.
3000000	3006000	They actually took out the tradable flag, so I can't even trade if I wanted to.
3006000	3012000	Because there were other problems that happened. Like, someone's account got hacked for it.
3013000	3015000	So they just clamped that down.
3015000	3017000	Over a freaking hat!
3017000	3018000	I know!
3020000	3022000	People like their E-peen.
3022000	3026000	Why do you think it went free-to-play? It still makes money.
3026000	3029000	And I don't blame Valve at all for it.
3029000	3035000	And especially since they're doing it in such a way that's much more open than they could've.
3035000	3038000	Or that they didn't need to.
3038000	3045000	I mean, there was a story a few weeks ago that Newell was talking that they had to talk to PayPal.
3045000	3051000	And say, no, he isn't trading drugs. He actually is getting this from digital hats.
3051000	3054000	But anyway, so I've been playing TF2.
3054000	3061000	I've also been going back to Newgrounds and playing all the small little itty-bitty things there.
3062000	3068000	There was one in particular I was really attracted to, and I'm actually going to look it up.
3068000	3075000	It had like a death state, so you either were alive and could do certain things,
3075000	3078000	or then you died and you could do other things and then get back to life and all that.
3078000	3081000	It was a nice little...
3081000	3085000	While you find the name of that, some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
3085000	3089000	sj100matt says, Segg just said he was fabulous, dropped the mic and walked away.
3089000	3091000	Yes, he did. He did do that.
3091000	3094000	Well, I didn't quite walk away. I'm kind of boxed in here in the seats.
3094000	3098000	ActDeaf is suggesting one called TF2NewbiesOnly.com.
3098000	3100000	But you're not a noob.
3100000	3103000	Oh, yeah. I know how to point and click.
3103000	3105000	All right.
3105000	3107000	Revive is the name of it.
3107000	3111000	Which is a really nice little fun game. I do recommend it.
3111000	3113000	Oh, and Harrison's like, congregate, please.
3113000	3116000	And I'm like, and please, I've been on Newgrounds.
3116000	3120000	You wouldn't have YouTube if it weren't for Newgrounds. I'll go on the record in saying that.
3120000	3124000	Because Newgrounds started when I was in high school, which was forever ago.
3124000	3127000	And it's still ticking.
3127000	3129000	You better watch it.
3131000	3134000	How old are you again? Because I think I'm a little older.
3134000	3137000	That's why I'm not saying a number.
3137000	3139000	It's all right.
3140000	3143000	But anyway, that's been most of my time.
3143000	3147000	Crawling around Newgrounds and TF2.
3147000	3149000	Oh, and moving.
3149000	3151000	Tetris in real life.
3151000	3153000	Yeah, Tetris in real life.
3153000	3157000	ActDeaf in our chat room just to clarify a previous comment saying,
3157000	3161000	it's called NewbiesOnly to welcome new players, but there are a lot of vets there.
3161000	3163000	So, to be fair to that server.
3163000	3166000	Anything else for the gaming week you want to share before we go to me?
3166000	3168000	Oh, we'll go to you.
3168000	3172000	All right. Honestly, I don't have a lot of new stuff to talk about, so I'll just be real quick.
3172000	3175000	Continuing to progress in Diablo 3.
3175000	3177000	I'm officially way further than I was before.
3177000	3181000	I'm in Act 3 now, which before the furthest I got was the beginning of Act 2.
3181000	3184000	So, yeah, I guess I'm kind of enjoying it this time.
3184000	3187000	I can't even explain it. Don't ask me why.
3187000	3190000	I think because I'm taking it at my own pace.
3190000	3194000	I'm actually exploring the auction house stuff a little bit.
3194000	3197000	Not the money auction house, but the gold one.
3197000	3200000	Trying to figure out the ins and outs on how to make money there.
3200000	3203000	And that's kind of a fascinating little meta game in and of itself.
3203000	3205000	But the real money auction house, forget it.
3205000	3208000	I mean, all that stuff is the real high-end stuff.
3208000	3210000	Otherwise, been playing Warcraft.
3210000	3214000	Yes, more Mass Effect, but playing a lot of the multiplayer this week.
3214000	3216000	I don't know. There was just kind of like a...
3216000	3219000	One night, we even did some streaming this week, didn't we, Darkseid?
3219000	3220000	Yeah, that was really...
3220000	3221000	Shane?
3221000	3224000	That was when my character was twitching and spasming on your screen.
3224000	3226000	Yeah, we were just laughing and having a good time.
3226000	3228000	We need to do more game streaming. That was actually fun.
3228000	3230000	And of course, more Tomb Raider.
3230000	3232000	I'm still getting closer to the end on that one.
3232000	3234000	And then you're going to lend it to me.
3234000	3237000	Sure, I guess, if you'll actually play it. Absolutely.
3237000	3241000	I tried playing Mass Effect, but now I bought it on PC.
3241000	3242000	That is true.
3243000	3244000	That is true.
3244000	3247000	So maybe we'll finally get Jamie to talk about another game.
3247000	3250000	If for no other reason, I will loan her Tomb Raider for that fact.
3250000	3252000	You know what, though? I love To the Moon.
3252000	3253000	Oh, yeah.
3253000	3254000	Have you played it?
3254000	3255000	Yes, you need to play To the Moon.
3255000	3256000	You need to play To the Moon.
3256000	3257000	I have not played To the Moon.
3257000	3258000	You need to play To the Moon.
3258000	3259000	I will. Yes, yes, sir.
3259000	3260000	Internet, you need to play To the Moon.
3260000	3263000	I'm probably where he's about middle-aged now.
3263000	3265000	I've just been sort of slowly going through it, but...
3265000	3266000	Have tissues.
3266000	3269000	I know. I already sobbed a little bit, because...
3269000	3270000	Oh.
3270000	3271000	But I found my favorite line.
3271000	3272000	Oh, you don't know.
3272000	3273000	I found my favorite line in the game.
3273000	3276000	It was like, that's a problem with you neurotypicals always telling us what to do.
3277000	3279000	That was my favorite line in the game so far.
3279000	3282000	I did play Civ V because I had to try it.
3282000	3287000	Somebody has built a custom mod that allows you to play as certain Mass Effect civilizations.
3287000	3288000	And my fandom...
3288000	3290000	I want to be a Krogan.
3290000	3291000	I don't know if they have those yet.
3291000	3294000	They have Asari and they have Volus.
3294000	3295000	It's kind of fun.
3295000	3296000	All right.
3296000	3298000	So I could talk like this the entire time.
3298000	3299000	Yes.
3300000	3301000	All right.
3301000	3302000	There we go.
3302000	3304000	That's that for now.
3304000	3305000	That's my gaming week.
3305000	3306000	Let's move on.
3306000	3307000	That's the best hat ever.

3323000	3324000	We're also on Google Plus.
3324000	3327000	We do have a great FOOGLE Question of the Week coming up later in the show,
3327000	3329000	so make sure you've answered it if you haven't already.
3329000	3334000	And I should plug that we are three weeks away from episode 500.
3335000	3339000	Still don't know how we're going to celebrate it, but we'll think of something.
3339000	3340000	That's going to be in April, won't it?
3340000	3341000	It will be in April.
3341000	3343000	It's going to be right before your birthday.
3343000	3344000	It will be.
3344000	3346000	Ooh, we should definitely have cake.
3346000	3347000	Yeah.
3347000	3348000	Jamie's like, throw me a party.
3348000	3349000	Yay.
3350000	3351000	It's my present.
3351000	3353000	Episode 500.
3353000	3354000	And I quit.
3354000	3355000	I quit.
3357000	3358000	No.
3358000	3360000	So see if somebody quits on episode 500.
3360000	3362000	That alone is worth tuning in for.
3362000	3363000	No, but I should have a diva breakdown.
3364000	3365000	It's about time for me to have one.
3365000	3368000	Yeah, I'm like, I've had at least two of those, so.
3368000	3370000	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.
3370000	3372000	What's going on in the gaming industry this week,
3372000	3374000	now that we're only an hour into the show?
3374000	3375000	Loki.
3375000	3376000	Oh, I should have talked more.
3376000	3377000	Yes.
3377000	3381000	There is a brand new Pokémon game coming out in Japan,
3381000	3383000	and I'm assuming over here at some point.
3383000	3385000	It'll probably be a console release, like a physical release,
3385000	3386000	when it comes out over here.
3386000	3388000	But Pokémon Rumble You.
3388000	3390000	It's...
3390000	3391000	No, Rumble Me.
3392000	3396000	I'm sorry, but the system is the Wii U, not the Wii Me.
3396000	3398000	Because Wii Me would be really weird.
3398000	3399000	That's what I call my cat.
3399000	3401000	If you want Pokémon to Rumble You,
3401000	3405000	you have issues of fandom beyond anything that Dark Sakura has for Garris,
3405000	3406000	I'm just saying.
3406000	3409000	You can make them Rumble You if you want,
3409000	3412000	because they do sell some individual figures that go along with this game.
3412000	3417000	That's right, it's going to be using the near-field communication technology
3417000	3420000	of the Wii U to hoard this game like Skylanders.
3420000	3422000	The inevitable has happened.
3422000	3423000	They have said,
3423000	3424000	Hey, guess what?
3424000	3427000	There's a game that involves collectible figures,
3427000	3430000	and they're making money off these figures like crazy.
3430000	3431000	Well, I like money.
3431000	3432000	We like money.
3432000	3436000	Nintendo needs more money, so that's what they're doing.
3436000	3438000	They're launching with seven figures.
3438000	3440000	Of course, one of those figures being Pikachu.
3440000	3442000	They're reasonably priced, I guess.
3442000	3446000	I guess 1,800 yen, or...
3446000	3450000	1,800 yen is the actual price of the game.
3450000	3452000	19 bucks, 20 bucks, whatever.
3452000	3455000	And the figures themselves are around 2 bucks, or 200 yen.
3455000	3456000	So 2 bucks each.
3456000	3458000	However, if you look at those figures, you're like,
3458000	3460000	Yeah, that's way too much for a figure.
3460000	3462000	They're like the Burger King figures, aren't they?
3462000	3466000	Yeah, they're like shit that you get out of a fucking quarter machine,
3466000	3467000	in the little bubbles, okay?
3467000	3468000	But they're Pokémon!
3468000	3472000	Oh, well in that case, let's charge the Pokémon Premium!
3472000	3473000	It prints money.
3474000	3476000	It's evolved into more money!
3476000	3479000	No, but they're gonna be doing this.
3479000	3482000	And my guess is this would probably launch over here in the fourth quarter,
3482000	3487000	just in time for the whole collectible figure game fad
3487000	3491000	to hit its Guitar Hero meltdown phase.
3491000	3494000	I am really curious how retail stores are gonna react to this,
3494000	3495000	because there's gonna be a point.
3495000	3498000	You know, there's already, like at the Target, or Toys R Us,
3498000	3500000	there's already like a Skylanders Isle.
3500000	3502000	So now, it's gonna...
3502000	3505000	There's gonna be Disney Infinity, there's gonna be Pokémon,
3505000	3507000	like there's gonna come a point where the retailers are gonna say,
3507000	3510000	Enough! No more.
3510000	3514000	Or it's now a competition to see which one of these we're gonna carry.
3514000	3518000	Or, here's a thought, and totally on speculation train.
3518000	3521000	You're seeing all these more physical item things,
3521000	3527000	so that sort of a bait and switch of going more digital for most things,
3527000	3530000	and then just having enough more retail presence things,
3530000	3533000	things that are justifiable beyond bits.
3533000	3534000	Hmm, interesting.
3534000	3535000	Just a thought.
3535000	3536000	Interesting.
3536000	3539000	A possible replacement for the Software Isle in the future.
3539000	3540000	Yeah.
3540000	3541000	Oh my gosh.
3541000	3542000	Here's my thing.
3542000	3546000	Is all the Pokémon that are included in this little pack or whatever,
3546000	3550000	or the figures that they have available, they all look the same.
3550000	3552000	I mean, I'm serious.
3552000	3555000	I don't know shit about Pokémon, and I'm not about to pretend that I do,
3555000	3558000	but all of these Pokémon in the screenshot look exactly the same,
3558000	3561000	except for color palette swaps or something like that.
3561000	3564000	I mean, it's just, they all look the same.
3564000	3567000	I just thought of a fun game for a future episode of OLR,
3567000	3570000	is that we'll show Loki pictures of various Pokémon,
3570000	3574000	and say, What do you think this one's called?
3574000	3578000	It's fine, because I don't know.
3578000	3581000	As long as it's multiple choice.
3581000	3582000	I'm pretty good at guessing.
3582000	3585000	No, but seriously, I...
3585000	3588000	I'm not going to say that they're not going to make money from this,
3588000	3590000	because there's people like Shane,
3590000	3593000	that will buy anything that has to do with Pokémon,
3593000	3595000	so I'm not surprised.
3595000	3597000	And he will get other people to buy it too.
3597000	3600000	I'm sure he's super excited to hear that Pokémon Pikachu system
3600000	3601000	is coming out over here.
3601000	3602000	He's probably going to pick that up.
3602000	3605000	He was trying to convince me I needed one.
3605000	3607000	He's your pusher, man.
3607000	3609000	I'm telling you.
3609000	3611000	So, yeah.
3611000	3612000	They're going to try.
3612000	3615000	My thing is, I don't know if it's going to be successful.
3615000	3616000	And the fact that, you know...
