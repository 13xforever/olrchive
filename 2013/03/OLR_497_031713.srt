[SPEAKER_00]: Pokemon is finally set to answer Skylanders.

3
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:22,879
[SPEAKER_00]: The makers of Super Smash Brothers promised better online in the next game.

[SPEAKER_00]: And worlds collide between Resident Evil 6 and Left 4 Dead 2.

6
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:45,294

00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:46,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy St.

8
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:50,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick's Day to you or happy Luigi Day as the case may be because you know Luigi wears green.

00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:57,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, gamer lols, anything gamer, and maybe a little bit of other stuff too.

[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.

11
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:04,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:13,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie Summers has been replaced by a monster on tonight's show.

13
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:16,216
[SPEAKER_01]: By one of those little gurgly things in WoW.

14
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:17,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the murlocs?

15
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:18,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Murlocs.

16
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:18,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Murlocs.

17
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:25,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello to Techmaster Loki, who ate a murloc for dinner.

18
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:27,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sort of.

19
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:28,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I helped.

20
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,019
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Loki?

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

22
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Just making sure I'm being picked up on the mic.

23
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:34,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mic is good.

24
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:38,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that was about.

25
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:43,384
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Pope Francis actually intervening and hoping that you wouldn't be heard tonight.

26
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:46,286
[SPEAKER_01]: You know he's still trying to get rid of that old Pope smell.

27
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:49,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, say hello.

28
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:52,070
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a special guest joining us tonight in studio.

29
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a big hello and welcome back to an old friend of Orange Lounge Radio who I haven't seen in a couple months.

30
00:01:57,715 --> 00:01:59,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm super excited.

31
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:03,319
[SPEAKER_04]: He took the drive all the way from the Bay Area just to be here with us tonight.

32
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:05,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Seg.

33
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR.

34
00:02:07,322 --> 00:02:08,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed you so.

35
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:09,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed you too.

36
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:10,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you buy me?

37
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:11,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

38
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:33,702
[SPEAKER_02]: uh how how are you oh what a year you've had a very interesting year yes very much so a lot of changes a lot of good things and a lot of not so good things but uh not dead yet despite the universe's best efforts uh and uh it's going to be an exciting year coming up

39
00:02:34,062 --> 00:03:02,505
[SPEAKER_04]: well let me talk to you a little bit more in just a minute here but I do want to give a plug for our chat room because some of the folks live tonight might want to chat with you Seg and they can do so by joining our chat room live.vognetwork.com in case you didn't know it is a live show it's a podcast too but we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show every Sunday night and if you are in our chat room

40
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:04,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Live.VogNetwork.com

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,867
[SPEAKER_02]: First recipient of Bachelor of Fine Arts in New Media at Emerson College in Boston, originally from Detroit, Dearborn.

42
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:43,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Worked for over five years at Telltale Games, making over 60 titles, more or less.

43
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Episodes are weird.

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:57,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I also co-founded Umlaut, which is a rock band charity concert in San Francisco and broadcasted around the world for Child's Play charity and stuff.

45
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:00,711
[SPEAKER_02]: and other things.

46
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that enough?

47
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:04,373
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's perfect.

48
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:05,133
[SPEAKER_04]: That's lots of stuff.

49
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:06,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we talk about Umlaut.

50
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:10,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with Umlaut because we've talked a lot about Umlaut on the show and we've all participated.

51
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:12,676
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone to past events and so forth.

52
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:20,780
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great thing that the whole Northern California community really gets involved with and now really the world too.

53
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been surprised in a positive way at how well Umlaut's been received?

54
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:33,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a crazy journey, this thing.

55
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:45,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually one of the first to play Guitar Hero because I playtested Guitar Hero 1 way back in the day in Central Square.

56
00:04:47,788 --> 00:05:05,687
[SPEAKER_02]: and I always wanted to see an event that focused on performance rather than score because the score didn't really interest me too much so much as the performance aspect and you know a few years when I moved over here to California the

57
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:07,949
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

58
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:34,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Pitch Me, Band Ideas

59
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:03,026
[SPEAKER_02]: and all this.

60
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:14,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the amount of talent that comes out of it and just the creativity and the fervor of excitement that comes out of each umlaut is just absolutely amazing.

61
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:24,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wouldn't happen if it weren't for the amazing year-round team that helps put on this show together.

62
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:28,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, I mean, it is not just me.

63
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it when people are like, oh, it's your thing.

64
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:33,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, it's not my thing.

65
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It is our thing.

66
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:40,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we've been able to raise quite a bit of money.

67
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:42,317
[SPEAKER_02]: How much did you pull in this last year?

68
00:06:42,377 --> 00:06:45,679
[SPEAKER_02]: This last year, we're looking, it's around $41,000.

69
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:48,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it was about $40,000.

70
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:52,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got a few things also rolled in late.

71
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:53,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's about $41,000.

72
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:56,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a bad chunk of change.

73
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:56,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad.

74
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:57,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad at all.

75
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,305
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for a great cause, too.

76
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,545
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun to work on.

77
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:07,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, of course, I know did a lot of graphic design and stuff for it.

78
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,789
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's a fun way for everybody to get involved.

79
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a lot of people that are kind of throwing themselves at you going, let me help?

80
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:20,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, once we get, you know, we're definitely going to be expanding more this year.

81
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:28,499
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want to expand the headliner program, which was a wild success this year, to explain what that is.

82
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,661
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Umlaut to Perform, it's a donation.

83
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year it was, how much, $200,000?

84
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:42,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year for a band package, and you split that between your band members, so it's not that much at all.

85
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:46,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 200 a band, but if your band has, what, seven people, what, three vocalists?

86
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:48,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

87
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:57,238
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an upper limit of seven just to help manage the cards and all that, but it doesn't have to be seven.

88
00:07:57,258 --> 00:08:00,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't be like Gwar getting up there with a big cup?

89
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:02,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a stage limit as well, but...

90
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:21,415
[SPEAKER_02]: uh well like one of the bands this is one of the headliners um French Kiss uh incorporated other friends that had confetti poppers everywhere and we we earned our cleaning fee this year with them oh man just confetti everywhere

91
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:26,039
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the response from the people who can't be there in person?

92
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you found that your internet presence has really grown?

93
00:08:29,602 --> 00:08:33,285
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a real boon with a partnership with Twitch.

94
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:36,227
[SPEAKER_02]: They featured us on the website and that just shot up.

95
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And also with Tim Schafer hosting was definitely an attraction.

96
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:45,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for reminding me of that because that was quite the feature for Umlaut this year.

97
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:45,634
[SPEAKER_04]: How

98
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:46,515
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you manage that?

99
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:18,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

100
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

101
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:27,116
[SPEAKER_02]: We kept that under wraps for a few months because we wanted it to be Tim Schafer's hosting and here's where you buy tickets.

102
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a great question for somebody that's been in the industry as long as you have.

103
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:38,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Since you brought up keeping secrets and you've worked for Telltale for many years and obviously they had some huge games over those years.

104
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,380
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to keep a lot of secrets when you work in this industry.

105
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,380
[SPEAKER_04]: How hard is that?

106
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:42,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Very.

107
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:53,349
[SPEAKER_02]: The hardest secret I ever had to keep was keeping from my sister Carolyn the fact that we were working on Tales of Monkey Island.

108
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,612
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the hardest because...

109
00:09:58,073 --> 00:10:08,782
[SPEAKER_02]: My sister and I grew up on the Scum era, and I leaned more towards the Sam & Max, she leaned more towards the Monkey Island side, but there's definitely shared love between the two.

110
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:20,372
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had to keep that secret for much longer than I would have liked, and I certainly heard about it from her.

111
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:21,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

112
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:24,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet, I bet.

113
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:32,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I told her a half hour before we were going live with the announcement, just so I could say that I told her before.

114
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:37,367
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys have 30 minutes before, that's great.

115
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:40,988
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys have questions for Seg, live.vognetwork.com.

116
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:47,570
[SPEAKER_04]: You can ask whatever you'd like, within reason, either about Umlaut or Space Between Studios or whatever.

117
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to talk about your new studio, but I had another quick question about Umlaut because I know this has got to be something that's on your mind.

118
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:55,832
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on a lot of people's mind when it comes to rock band.

119
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:59,613
[SPEAKER_04]: They've announced no more DLC after, what is it, two weeks?

120
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:01,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the last DLC we're ever going to see.

121
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:06,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, you know, the end had to happen at some point, right?

122
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:13,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's hard to be upset about the end of Rock Band DLC when no other game in the history of gaming has been supported the way the Rock Band has been.

123
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:14,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, five years.

124
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:14,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be real.

125
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:16,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And with as much as they've got, right?

126
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:23,556
[SPEAKER_04]: So, are you worried, though, that, like, uh-oh, if this means that Rock Band is sunsetting...

127
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,577
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going to happen to Umlaut?

128
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:57,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's what I point to, not just to blindly say, oh yeah, we're still going to do it.

129
00:11:57,344 --> 00:12:03,913
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the evidence of all the people that just want to pour in all the performances who just...

130
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:16,349
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, our marketing challenge for our event is getting people to experience for the first time Umlaut, whether it's online or in person.

131
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:22,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we know that once people experience it, they're coming back next year or really heavily regretting it.

132
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:28,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know we have a very good event on our hands.

133
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:31,318
[SPEAKER_02]: We know we have an event that people love, that people want to participate in.

134
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:57,095
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh harmonics moving on from rock band doesn't uh hasn't altered that so so maybe it'll be a dance party with Dance Central in a couple years surely you've kicked that idea around I mean we've kicked the idea yeah but obvious conclusion right I mean it's it's hard to do you know it's hard to do that on stage because well for one it's only two people and then it's it's yeah it's

135
00:12:57,415 --> 00:12:59,155
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a main stage thing.

136
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:05,617
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to push as many bands and people on stage just because we're only doing it one night.

137
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:10,378
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that we get as many people to experience the big stage.

138
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is the performance of it all, too.

139
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,359
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.

140
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,600
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look back at the history of this show, we started around DDR.

141
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,721
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to do episodes of this show live from Dance Dance Revolution tournaments and stuff.

142
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:28,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me tell you, they'll always be somewhere in gaming, like a performance game.

143
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've seen that ever since, really.

144
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:32,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess DDR probably was the first of that that I could think of.

145
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:34,057
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a performance-based game.

146
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:36,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see a Visual K-themed band next year.

147
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:39,465
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my personal challenge out to anybody, by the way.

148
00:13:39,565 --> 00:14:06,935
[SPEAKER_02]: anything is possible I try not to meddle in the affairs of bands but I just want to put out there I would love to see someone do a mashup and or a Weird Al rendition of a song because the game's on no fail so you don't worry about score anyways I wish people would explore the space that's what we do at my house

149
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:12,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've seen people do... Because Born This Way, right?

150
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can do the whole perform this way.

151
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:15,024
[SPEAKER_04]: You can totally do it.

152
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:16,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good times.

153
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:19,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't Lola in there?

154
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think we've done Yoda.

155
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps.

156
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:22,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

157
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:25,456
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did I want to ask about?

158
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:28,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, one other question I got about Umla and then I want to talk about some of your other projects too.

159
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:41,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you get people, you know, since you have had success on the internet and you're recognized on Twitch as a national thing now, it's not just something that's NorCal, do you get people coming to you going,

160
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:45,510
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I have an umlaut in Tallahassee, Florida?

161
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:48,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how do I do an umlaut in Titicaca?

162
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:50,838
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely a request for that.

163
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring umlaut to me.

164
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:54,683
[SPEAKER_02]: There's sort of two prongs to that answer.

165
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,485
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the umlaut branding...

166
00:14:57,987 --> 00:15:11,352
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know exactly how to, for us under the Umlaut brand, to franchise and do it in such a way that we can ensure that the quality and...

167
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:18,313
[SPEAKER_02]: The organization is up to our standards, you know, to make sure that, you know, things are above board.

168
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:27,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like, you know, it's not that I imagine people being shady about it, but it's not something we can just go, oh, yeah, use, you know, use the Umla brand and all that.

169
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:35,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're very, we're protective on it because we want to make sure we do something, you know, we do it right if we branch out with the Umla brand.

170
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:39,497
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as, but not like you need us either.

171
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:40,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

172
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:51,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It all comes down to, do you have enough people and enough partnerships you can start to make a thing together and to rent out a place?

173
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:57,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have enough of a community around to pull out the rock band and make it happen.

174
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:58,425
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

175
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:12,591
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's more event planning than the rock band part, because believe me, as the sound techs at DNA Lounge, where we have our event, have told me we're one of the easier shows to tech.

176
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:14,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.

177
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:20,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's microphones and looped back and the monitors, but the rest of the instruments.

178
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,775
[SPEAKER_02]: That part's the easiest, right?

179
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:22,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

180
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what it takes to plan a convention?

181
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:41,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It would not be pretty.

182
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:47,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the better idea is to take... Like, Fanime, hey, don't you want like an OLR night or something?

183
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:48,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

184
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to leech onto something else.

185
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,861
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way it's gonna happen.

186
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:53,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been part of a first-gen con.

187
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:55,724
[SPEAKER_01]: It's first ever.

188
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:58,126
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Ground Zero Con in Mobile, Alabama.

189
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,927
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Christmas at Ground Zero

190
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:29,737
[SPEAKER_02]: The proto-umlaut was actually Fundrauser, which was in a bar, 200 capacity.

191
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't involved, but I went to it.

192
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:53,299
[SPEAKER_04]: and that packed the place up and that's like okay if day of advertising able to get that many people rolling in and then it was a scale up from there if that was all umlaut ever was now obviously it's turned into something bigger but even if it's just that you're still raising money for a good exactly so why not why not dream a little bigger

193
00:17:57,157 --> 00:18:00,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Dream Big, you started your own game studio.

194
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

195
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:03,804
[SPEAKER_03]: No pressure.

196
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,587
[SPEAKER_04]: You were at Telltale.

197
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:09,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Layoffs happened in the industry.

198
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:12,233
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter who you work for.

199
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:14,155
[SPEAKER_04]: These types of things happen.

200
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:17,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you work on Walking Dead?

201
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:18,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

202
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:25,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's got to feel real good, though, that you were a part of that because that was such a huge success, right?

203
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:26,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

204
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:34,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Working through the years and building up the studio and really having all of us...

205
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:50,432
[SPEAKER_02]: really come to a point where we're really recognized for our work is just a testament to the years of dedication we all put in to make that go.

206
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:54,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, there's that old saying, when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade.

207
00:18:54,955 --> 00:19:01,560
[SPEAKER_04]: So you certainly have done that in some regard with this whole thing because, you know, unfortunately you took that bad news that happened there.

208
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's just an inevitable fact of that industry, unfortunately, is that, you know, as projects come and go, people come and go, right?

209
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,927
[SPEAKER_04]: We've reported it how many times on this show?

210
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:12,188
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times on this show?

211
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:21,914
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we are, now, you know, that all happened at the end of last year, and now here we are, March of this year, and you're like, okay, I'm not going to be the type that just sits on my butt and watches Oprah all day.

212
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:27,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to... Well, Oprah's off the air, and I don't have cake.

213
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:28,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, she has a network now.

214
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:31,940
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the line, when life gives you lemons, you demand to see life's manager?

215
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:38,904
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've turned that into a game studio, so how did that, did you just, did you wake up one day and go...

216
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:40,972
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I should start a game studio.

217
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:47,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I should really talk more about the project, and the studio kind of comes after that a little bit.

218
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:59,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to... After the layoff, I was thinking of why I love video games so much, why I've dedicated...

219
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:05,067
[SPEAKER_02]: My life, my career to video games and all that.

220
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:19,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had this idea floating around of making a project that explained how video games communicate as an art form.

221
00:20:20,174 --> 00:20:29,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through school for it and actually kind of made my own curriculum because I was the first person to go through my program.

222
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:51,557
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of things that we know, but very few have really pinned it down, put some definitions onto it, put some context on it, and delivered it in a way that a general public would actually play through and all that.

223
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:55,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to make a video game of video games.

224
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:23,697
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to wrap my head around this idea a lot i know we we talk about like artistic video games we we think a lot about like flower and journey you know the things that that game company have done the art in that maybe even like so much the art of storytelling in a game like walking dead certainly it affected a lot of people when it's it's storytelling so what's what's the difference between like a artsy video game because that's not what you're talking about you're not talking about making an artsy video game you're talking about making a video game that tell like

225
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:26,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to wrap my head around it a little bit.

226
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:32,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of, you know, in high school or in college, you know, there are film appreciation classes.

227
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:34,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like a film appreciation one-on-one class.

228
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:35,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

229
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:49,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Where, you know, that class, you're walking in there, you know, it's not like you haven't experienced film before, but those classes are to bring some terminology and some understanding and perspective in.

230
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:57,768
[SPEAKER_02]: about how artists use this particular form of media to communicate ideas.

231
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:01,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make the video games appreciation 101 class.

232
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:06,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And rather than making it a book where

233
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:20,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be going like, oh, this concept, like in this game, assuming you played that game, but if you're going in for a video game appreciation textbook, you can assume that they haven't played that particular game.

234
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:27,594
[SPEAKER_02]: So rather, I wanted to make a game so instead of just textually writing about it and talking about it and all that, it's like, no, here is the concept.

235
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:28,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it out in front of you.

236
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:34,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's have you experience it the way it's intended to in that form of media.

237
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually really get a deep understanding by doing rather than rote.

238
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the game that will make Roger Ebert understand.

239
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:43,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

240
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,650
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm trying not to...

241
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:55,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that the piece won't spend much time trying to answer the question, is video games art?

242
00:22:55,137 --> 00:22:56,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just simply, yes, they are art.

243
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:57,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

244
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:04,247
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the opinionated opinion I'm starting with on this piece.

245
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:04,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they're art.

246
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:05,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go into it.

247
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,511
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know the result you want.

248
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:13,791
[SPEAKER_04]: How are we going to get there?

249
00:23:14,412 --> 00:23:17,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Good question.

250
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:27,494
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a few people that are working on it sort of part-time and part-part-time on it.

251
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:35,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Jessica Johnson being a writer for me and being sort of the foil and keeping me into focus of the actual content of it.

252
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:43,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Dan as a programmer that's very interested in working with me on the project.

253
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:48,549
[SPEAKER_02]: But really it comes down to funding, to be quite honest.

254
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:57,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bugger about this kind of project is, usually when you go out for funding for a game and all that, when you're doing it professionally, air quotes,

255
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:26,534
[SPEAKER_02]: is that you say well here's similar games that we're trying to make and here was their return on investment here's where their profitability and here's where we're going to twist and make something different I don't have any game to point to that is anywhere similar to this no one has made a video game about video games to the kind of depth and length that I'm searching for with this piece

256
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:30,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it turns me to do the inevitable Kickstarter.

257
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:39,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to ask, because a year ago I wouldn't have been able to ask you, but now that we're in 2013, is Kickstarter the answer for this?

258
00:24:39,832 --> 00:24:41,794
[SPEAKER_04]: That currently is my answer.

259
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:43,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Indiegogo, or any of those...

260
00:24:44,237 --> 00:25:11,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing Kickstarter because I want to if I'm doing this I want to do it in a way that actually funds the game and that's going to be six figures easy because I want to respect the people that are going to work on this for me and that means paying them decently so it ends up being a six figure figure and

261
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:18,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiegogo is just not producing those kinds of results consistently.

262
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:23,564
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a branding of Kickstarter that you can't dismiss.

263
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:35,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, I would love to have some capital investment come in, swoop down, and make it go, but barring that...

264
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:52,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to prove that there's an audience for this and really the available way to do that in this case I believe is through Kickstarter because then I can say here are these people who actually put money down that actually want to have this thing happen.

265
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,661
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you preparing for this Kickstarter?

266
00:25:56,901 --> 00:26:00,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's a lot of, you know, there's budget for one.

267
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:04,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a spreadsheet that is so dynamic.

268
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:08,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank God you've had to do some financial planning for Umlaut in the past, right?

269
00:26:08,404 --> 00:26:09,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, right?

270
00:26:09,744 --> 00:26:11,324
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going into this totally blind.

271
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:11,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

272
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:39,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I have quite a bit of experience of doing budgets and all that and I have to say that I've had a really good business teacher and that's my father or Uncle Ed to you Hi Dad I think I see him in chat He had a comment earlier in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com about Tim Schafer at Umlaut and that he was a great addition to Umlaut this year

273
00:26:41,475 --> 00:27:06,788
[SPEAKER_02]: and Uncle Ed is a great addition to Umlaut he does the books and everything among many other things but he is a former Ford employee and I learned enough about business to go about knowing enough about business to know when I need an adult laughter

274
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:23,356
[SPEAKER_02]: and which man that's a bit you know I through the years really realizing how special and unique that is because boy we all have seen people who really don't know how to business and and don't

275
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:26,097
[SPEAKER_02]: understand for themselves.

276
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:33,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck yeah, there's been so many moments during the times of OLR in the past where, you know, we're trying to do something, it's like, I need an adult!

277
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:52,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm not going in this completely blindly, but so, you know, there's making the budget and figure out, okay, how much is needed, what is going to be the markup of Kickstarter fees and credit card fees and all that, and then the fulfillment fees and

278
00:27:54,202 --> 00:28:19,082
[SPEAKER_02]: of the actual prizes and all that that run down from how much is bandwidth going to cost to deliver on final thing to all the physical items, what's good, what's not good, and trying to balancing all those numbers so that if this thing gets green-lighted, I'm not going, well, I have these thousands of dollars worth of stuff I have to pay for in order to get to people.

279
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:20,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, crap.

280
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:20,884
Yeah.

281
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:50,605
[SPEAKER_04]: you may not have the answer to this question yet but let me try to throw it out there anyway just because this is the question that people will be asking once this goes live but you know why am I going to want to donate to this why will I want to donate and help Space Between Studios create this game what this game is intending to do is be the community's way of illustrating to the rest of the world why video games

282
00:28:51,855 --> 00:29:01,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Why we love video games and why we think video games is unique as a form of art that communicates ideas.

283
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:11,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And to answer that in the way of what makes video games work to communicate ideas.

284
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:17,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we attracted to the things that we like about video games?

285
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:20,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we dissuaded about the things that don't work about video games?

286
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you be able to answer the question why we've been sitting here for the past 11 years every Sunday night talking about this crap?

287
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:32,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, that's more in the psychology end.

288
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,614
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a nice way of saying nobody can answer that.

289
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,897
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be an exercise.

290
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:41,560
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a true exercise in recursive thinking.

291
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,173
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a game designer, not a head doctor.

292
00:29:46,694 --> 00:29:48,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mean to make it about us.

293
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:50,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about us.

294
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:51,296
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on our show.

295
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:59,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to ask.

296
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:09,444
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have this fully fleshed out as far as the outline because I also want to hear from the community at large, and this is development and players, of

297
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:21,808
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the things about video games we would want to communicate to people who may not know or play video games all that well but have an interest just to know more?

298
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:34,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think throwing people to any one particular game is going to begin to answer what the diaspora of video games are.

299
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:45,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to be a piece that is a sort of neutral ground where it doesn't make an assumption of what experience level and what you've played before.

300
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:49,547
[SPEAKER_02]: That's both not played before or super experience.

301
00:30:49,587 --> 00:30:54,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not making initial assumptions of audience that way.

302
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:56,210
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll customize based off of experience.

303
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,731
[SPEAKER_02]: How you approach things.

304
00:30:58,192 --> 00:30:59,833
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take those creative choices there.

305
00:31:00,874 --> 00:31:08,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But really want to present something that we can go, hey, oh, you want to know more about video games?

306
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:13,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get this game and play and then we'll talk about it after.

307
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:18,510
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you really want to know, it's going to cost you because we hear gamers love microtransactions.

308
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no.

309
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:21,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing that.

310
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, now.

311
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,090
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to.

312
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,471
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to.

313
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:27,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Will your game be always online required?

314
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:27,792
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

315
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:29,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get that out now.

316
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:29,653
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

317
00:31:30,393 --> 00:31:30,753
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

318
00:31:33,314 --> 00:31:40,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have the game that's DRM-free, Windows, Linux, Mac.

319
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:42,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it coming to the OUYA?

320
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:49,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, that's the other consoles and platforms I'm definitely not saying no to.

321
00:31:50,104 --> 00:31:57,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sticking to the big three desktop platforms because I can 100% promise that 100% go and all that.

322
00:31:58,406 --> 00:32:02,667
[SPEAKER_02]: We are using Unity, so it's not gating other platforms outright.

323
00:32:03,128 --> 00:32:03,628
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

324
00:32:04,668 --> 00:32:19,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather promise things we can deliver on and it's not that I mean there are other avenues that I am exploring I just I only want to promise the things I can promise don't write checks your ass can't cash we all heard that before

325
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:47,720
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not like I'm mentioning that Minecraft will be on a dot dot dot if I'm torn on whether to ask you this question or not because this question can be perceived as a negative from our chat room but I think it's a tough question and I've been through worse I'm going to say if you're going to take it to the internet you're going to get this so let me ask you this question from RossDLUT in the chat room that says so this is a testament to the community's insecurity and need for approval are gamers insecure?

326
00:32:48,271 --> 00:32:50,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, it's not a statement.

327
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:51,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

328
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:59,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the impression of just gamers need to themselves need to like defend or whatever.

329
00:33:00,276 --> 00:33:07,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just there hasn't been a really good academic text that's approachable.

330
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Could this be a celebration of gaming?

331
00:33:11,382 --> 00:33:12,743
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a celebration of gaming.

332
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm making my pitch a little bit geared towards more of people who have played games because I think if you're listening to this show, I can make that assumption.

333
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:23,392
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good way of thinking.

334
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:25,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

335
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:27,456
[SPEAKER_02]: No judging, but you know.

336
00:33:28,536 --> 00:33:34,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, going back to the academic approach, though, what about having it as a tool for, like, say, officials?

337
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:43,792
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people who are making those legislation about... Well, I don't want the piece to become an out-and-out political tool.

338
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:48,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making, very consciously, not going into...

339
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:53,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Topical things or even current topics.

340
00:33:53,823 --> 00:34:01,591
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, I'm not going to touch behavior of online chat and XBLA and all that.

341
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:03,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Comment threads on the internet.

342
00:34:03,914 --> 00:34:05,155
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing artistic about that.

343
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:12,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just keep Tumblr out of it because all anyone does is talk about Mass Effect.

344
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:14,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bringing that out.

345
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:17,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even so much like this is a text of the community.

346
00:34:19,227 --> 00:34:23,190
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just how video games communicate as an art form.

347
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:33,097
[SPEAKER_02]: But to that end, as tools, one of the plans I have for the Kickstarter reward tiers is

348
00:34:33,557 --> 00:34:49,632
[SPEAKER_02]: is you get a digital copy but you can pick a library classroom whatever academic it's you know whatever can I'm leaving a little bit broad you know so people if people come up with something that we haven't thought about that would fit in there

349
00:34:50,632 --> 00:35:13,939
[SPEAKER_02]: community service organization but a kit that's so far speccing as two physical DVDs a site license documentation saying yes this institution has a site license for the game so it's not limited to the two physical copies and two physical copies of the softcover handbook that we're also going to produce as a sort of companion piece with it

350
00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:35,248
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's a you know you get a thing but then you can send out a thing and that's going to be on the little on the the little more upper range because that's an expensive sure you know more expensive than a digitally downloadable thing but you know I am putting the cut-ins for library in that educational text but I'm also not trying to make this edutainment uh

351
00:35:35,988 --> 00:35:37,929
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't just the pure academic.

352
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:39,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to take the approach.

353
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:46,174
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually more speaking to where I want to go in a studio perspective.

354
00:35:48,136 --> 00:35:56,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take my approach of how I've approached all of these licensed properties and all that that I worked in in Telltale and all that.

355
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:27,298
[SPEAKER_02]: where I take this canon from Strong Bad and it has this very well documented wiki which was such a boon I have to say that the Homestar wiki helped out so much but taking the approach and care I've done to all these fictional franchises and take that same approach but to non-fictional things where the canon is reality

356
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:37,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and understanding video games is the piece that is my first piece in that approach.

357
00:36:37,484 --> 00:36:46,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what I guess for the most part when it comes to edutainment or serious games or whatever you want to call it, I'm not trying to make a complete blanket statement, but...

358
00:36:48,970 --> 00:37:05,982
[SPEAKER_02]: There just seems to be this disconnect of all the rich development and decisions being made on fictional games that are wonderful and awesome, but it's just not transferring over to other fields and other things that would really benefit from it.

359
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:17,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is sort of my particular answer to try and give the perspective of we don't necessarily need to do straight-up fiction work with our art form.

360
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:34,362
[SPEAKER_04]: well you've got quite a path ahead of you until you get to the end I do kind of want to wrap up so we can move on talk about the weekend news but if somebody wants to keep tabs on your project on the Kickstarter that'll be coming eventually how can they do that?

361
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:53,127
[SPEAKER_02]: SpaceBetweenStudios.com and it has all the social media blah blah blah The Twitter's, the Facebook's, the Google Plus even cause why not and oh no Harrison's there?

362
00:37:53,627 --> 00:37:53,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha!

363
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:55,893
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Harrison?

364
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:58,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm totally reading chat and totally distracting myself.

365
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn you, Harrison!

366
00:38:00,115 --> 00:38:01,095
[SPEAKER_04]: It took us forever.

367
00:38:01,515 --> 00:38:02,856
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to do the same thing.

368
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:05,257
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be like our show would be us reading the chat room.

369
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:09,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm just seeing Bobby going, Harrison Pink.

370
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:16,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I would actually love, Sag, because there is kind of like a spirited debate going on about what is the purpose of this.

371
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:22,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would love for you to continue on in our chat room after we're done talking here and we get into the news.

372
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:27,886
[SPEAKER_04]: SpaceBetweenStudios.com and on the Twitters and all that stuff.

373
00:38:29,447 --> 00:38:34,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this is probably so early, but I'd be made fun of if I didn't ask this as a commentator.

374
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Any idea on the time frame?

375
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:45,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming Greenlight and everything, if the Kickstarter passes and I'm able to be solvent on that...

376
00:38:46,874 --> 00:38:59,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm currently looking at a, well, it'd be ambitious if I said December 2014, but it's probably going to be January 2015 for digital release.

377
00:39:00,258 --> 00:39:07,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm purposefully putting a two month block of the physical releases of stuff because I want to make sure things are...

378
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:20,765
[SPEAKER_02]: completely bug free before I mint the final physical discs or anything but everyone would get the digital when I'm not splitting hairs there

379
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good luck.

380
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:25,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll need it.

381
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:32,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so... I just want to... I can't wait to just see it.

382
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:33,462
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

383
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:37,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one thing to kind of hear you describe it, and then I'm kind of like, I just can't wait to kind of jump in.

384
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:40,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there is so... You know, when you think about it, it's like a celebration.

385
00:39:41,227 --> 00:39:43,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, what we're talking about here.

386
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:44,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this...

387
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:50,354
[SPEAKER_04]: This show, my life would be dramatically different if video games didn't exist, right?

388
00:39:50,394 --> 00:39:56,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I'm sure we all have that story of mom growing up saying, you keep playing those games, you'll never amount to anything.

389
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that right, Uncle Ed?

390
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:06,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, now, well, video games have helped you raise, over the years, probably $100,000 at this point for charity, right?

391
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:07,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the five years?

392
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:07,968
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at $40,000.

393
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well...

394
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:12,532
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about, I'm going to say 80k.

395
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:16,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, regardless, a huge number.

396
00:40:16,774 --> 00:40:20,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is because of your love of video games, our love for video games.

397
00:40:21,316 --> 00:40:33,282
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, wanting to perform that, wanting to, you know, show the community gamers aren't just crazy people on Xbox with guns that shoot children.

398
00:40:33,402 --> 00:40:36,223
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's not what gamers are at all.

399
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:39,414
[SPEAKER_02]: The one point I do want to make and then we can actually continue on.

400
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:41,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, no worries.

401
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:54,327
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Kickstarter and all that, I am, and you can hold me to the fire on this, when we go into development with this, you are going to hear from us constantly.

402
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:57,430
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make sure we do at least once a month

403
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:04,876
[SPEAKER_02]: General, like, you know, what we did in the past month thing, but it's also trying to be available in forums and all that.

404
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:11,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not going to be one of those Kickstarters that, like, don't say anything for a few months and everyone's like, stop.

405
00:41:12,663 --> 00:41:20,130
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so we... And this piece won't exist if it won't... If the community doesn't participate with it.

406
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

407
00:41:21,751 --> 00:41:28,977
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't, I mean, yes, ultimately we make final decisions with the piece, but it is not going to be in a vacuum.

408
00:41:29,137 --> 00:41:32,940
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to need everyone else's participation.

409
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I love these comments in the chat room.

410
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:36,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to read these before we move on.

411
00:41:36,683 --> 00:41:37,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been looking.

412
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:38,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Chad.

413
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Harrison Pink in our chat room, HG Pink says, Everyone back SAG.

414
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:43,989
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a smart guy who loves games and won't steal from you.

415
00:41:44,486 --> 00:41:45,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you, Harrison.

416
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:46,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss you, man.

417
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:51,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Uncle Ed, just defending himself a little bit in chat, so I think it's fair to read this.

418
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:53,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave you the TRS-80 in the early 80s.

419
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mother's the one that had issues with it.

420
00:41:55,451 --> 00:41:56,251
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was saying.

421
00:41:57,211 --> 00:41:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I meant with that comment.

422
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:01,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that right that mom said that, Uncle Ed?

423
00:42:03,174 --> 00:42:05,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

424
00:42:05,996 --> 00:42:07,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, best of luck to you.

425
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:14,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just with Space Between Studios but with Umlaut going into this year and whatever else may come.

426
00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:16,663
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be at PAX East as an attendee.

427
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:22,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a crazy person because I'm doing PAX this week.

428
00:42:23,368 --> 00:42:24,889
[SPEAKER_02]: We leave hopefully Tuesday.

429
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it's going to be fun time weather so we'll see.

430
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:31,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday, Sin and I will be going to Boston.

431
00:42:33,054 --> 00:42:33,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless Sin.

432
00:42:33,815 --> 00:42:37,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Her birthday's Wednesday and I'm throwing her a birthday party in Boston?

433
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,090
[SPEAKER_02]: To which she knows no one there.

434
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:43,611
[SPEAKER_02]: She has never met anyone there because she doesn't know anyone in Boston.

435
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:47,273
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one friend from here that's also coming along.

436
00:42:47,313 --> 00:42:49,693
[SPEAKER_02]: But everyone else is like, meet my friends.

437
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:51,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Parties with strangers can be the best kind.

438
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they can.

439
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:56,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be at PAX this weekend.

440
00:42:57,395 --> 00:43:03,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I make a sign that says, ask me about video games and park myself somewhere and see what happens.

441
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

442
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:05,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

443
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It works for the free hugs guy.

444
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:07,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

445
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:10,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're going to GDC.

446
00:43:10,451 --> 00:43:13,272
[SPEAKER_02]: And then GDC because I'm a crazy person.

447
00:43:13,572 --> 00:43:15,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get back the Monday.

448
00:43:15,313 --> 00:43:19,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, GDC starts Monday, but I have the Wednesday through Friday pass.

449
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:21,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently there's stuff I can go to on the Tuesday.

450
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:27,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go to the Facebook day and the Google day.

451
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:28,896
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all these sponsored ones.

452
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:31,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Come equipped with Pocky.

453
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:32,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

454
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:33,577
[SPEAKER_04]: You are right.

455
00:43:34,482 --> 00:43:35,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Free candy.

456
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:37,748
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be a stranger with candy.

457
00:43:39,752 --> 00:43:43,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so, and by the way, just so you know, Uncle Ed said in chat, ouch, she just hit me.

458
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,320
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

459
00:43:48,121 --> 00:43:49,182
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hilarious.

460
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:50,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, have fun at PAX East.

461
00:43:50,423 --> 00:43:51,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun at GDC.

462
00:43:51,304 --> 00:43:59,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently if the listeners want to say hi to you at PAX East, talk to you in person about this, look for the guy who has the sign that says, ask me about video games.

463
00:44:00,691 --> 00:44:01,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

464
00:44:01,332 --> 00:44:04,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure at some point you will find the VOG contingent.

465
00:44:04,815 --> 00:44:05,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Black will.

466
00:44:05,495 --> 00:44:06,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they'll find me.

467
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:07,257
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll find you.

468
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:07,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

469
00:44:08,157 --> 00:44:08,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

470
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be realistic here.

471
00:44:10,499 --> 00:44:13,502
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a social media that I think you should add to the list.

472
00:44:14,642 --> 00:44:15,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Tumblr.

473
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:15,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

474
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,066
[SPEAKER_01]: There is much wank on Tumblr, but much spreading of information.

475
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:22,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not hating on Tumblr.

476
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:24,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I would never want to incur that wrath.

477
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I've left almost all social media for Tumblr.

478
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:30,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Tumblr is a very interesting place.

479
00:44:30,893 --> 00:44:31,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the GIFs.

480
00:44:32,353 --> 00:44:37,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a few friends that I follow on the Tumblrs, but I do not have a Tumblr.

481
00:44:39,456 --> 00:44:43,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Say thanks again for being here tonight and you will stay and talk about the week in news.

482
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:45,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, because I have opinions.

483
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:46,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

484
00:44:46,425 --> 00:44:46,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we all?

485
00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:49,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so let's talk about our gaming week.

486
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:53,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll move a little quickly tonight because we are... Because I talk forever.

487
00:44:53,354 --> 00:44:53,855
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

488
00:44:54,115 --> 00:44:54,536
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

489
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:56,758
[SPEAKER_04]: You earned it.

490
00:44:57,038 --> 00:44:59,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, DarkSakura, how was your game?

491
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:00,259
[SPEAKER_01]: What the crap else do I play?

492
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:02,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3.

493
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:05,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was actually playing around with modding Mass Effect 2.

494
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,561
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that Bioware's like, yeah, go ahead, mod it all you want, EA patch.

495
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:12,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it.

496
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:21,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I've been playing a lot more Mass Effect and a little bit more To The Moon because that game is absolutely...

497
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:24,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Just it causes the feels to happen.

498
00:45:24,886 --> 00:45:26,448
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes the feels happen and they hurt.

499
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:30,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've been looking at a few other things.

500
00:45:31,055 --> 00:45:35,861
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, my job right now is going to the gym and looking for a job.

501
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:38,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's about it.

502
00:45:40,011 --> 00:45:41,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then we'll move on to Loki.

503
00:45:41,111 --> 00:45:41,812
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

504
00:45:42,632 --> 00:45:47,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I've been playing a ton of Saints Row the Third, ironically enough.

505
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:53,736
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I started playing again with my co-worker, which is probably going to end that pretty soon because he's leaving.

506
00:45:55,317 --> 00:46:00,319
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been playing co-op on 360 with the full package.

507
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:06,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually haven't really been playing a DLC because it sucks, but main game.

508
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:08,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've been messing around with that a little bit.

509
00:46:09,664 --> 00:46:14,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on PC, I finally got my copy.

510
00:46:14,628 --> 00:46:20,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I had my copy since that THQ sale on the Humble Indie Bundle, THQ Bundle.

511
00:46:21,353 --> 00:46:32,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've been playing a heavily modded version of the game, mainly just so I could get the additional cheat that was actually missing from the console version, which was the evil car code.

512
00:46:32,863 --> 00:46:35,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the evil car code from the other games.

513
00:46:35,485 --> 00:46:38,026
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

514
00:46:54,675 --> 00:47:01,843
[SPEAKER_05]: on the Steam version and hopefully I'm going to do the same on the console version because I've been trying to finish missions differently because I lost my save that I had.

515
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:06,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I had an in-game save with almost everything done and sure enough I don't know where it is.

516
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Dope.

517
00:47:08,731 --> 00:47:10,953
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to save your games in the cloud.

518
00:47:10,993 --> 00:47:11,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fuck that.

519
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:14,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not saving shit in the cloud.

520
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:23,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly gamers want their saves in the cloud because they keep losing them.

521
00:47:24,681 --> 00:47:25,522
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what gamers want.

522
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,842
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hearing gamers loud and clear on what they want.

523
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:30,343
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I used to call the cloud?

524
00:47:30,483 --> 00:47:31,303
[SPEAKER_05]: The internet!

525
00:47:31,903 --> 00:47:32,543
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

526
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:34,103
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fucking internet.

527
00:47:34,123 --> 00:47:36,244
[SPEAKER_05]: You're saving it to a server somewhere else.

528
00:47:38,084 --> 00:47:41,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would I want to do that when I can just save it to a memory card that I know where the fuck it is?

529
00:47:42,105 --> 00:47:43,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and hey, if the internet's down, guess what?

530
00:47:43,868 --> 00:47:48,415
[SPEAKER_05]: My save still works because it's on a memory card and not in the fucking cloud.

531
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:51,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So, no, I'm fine not saving to the cloud.

532
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I do have one cloud save right now.

533
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:57,008
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my old Minecraft save for Xbox Live Arcade.

534
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:58,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually agree with you.

535
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:00,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn off all of my cloud storage stuff.

536
00:48:00,993 --> 00:48:05,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about taking it out because I hate having the second option pop up all the time for saves.

537
00:48:05,337 --> 00:48:06,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I turn it on.

538
00:48:06,058 --> 00:48:08,300
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not hurting anything.

539
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,963
[SPEAKER_01]: What I don't like about it is that sometimes it overwrites some of my save files on Mass Effect.

540
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:13,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I can see that.

541
00:48:14,406 --> 00:48:17,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I've been playing that and then a little Call of Duty.

542
00:48:17,168 --> 00:48:18,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still playing Call of Duty.

543
00:48:20,618 --> 00:48:22,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And moving, because I also moved.

544
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been slowly getting back to Team Fortress 2.

545
00:48:34,747 --> 00:48:39,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Team Fortress players want to adopt a SAG?

546
00:48:56,747 --> 00:49:09,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have... So, it's funny when I play Team Fortress 2 because I have the rarest, most sought-after item that wasn't the gold wrench in TF2.

547
00:49:09,663 --> 00:49:13,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a self-made Max hat because we...

548
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:25,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone that was working at Telltale at the time when we were releasing Season 3 of Sam & Max, we all got the self-made Max hat so it sparkles because I'm fabulous.

549
00:49:29,158 --> 00:49:31,139
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my role on this show.

550
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:33,640
[SPEAKER_02]: You've just been out-fabbed.

551
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:38,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because I'll play and then someone will go like...

552
00:49:39,892 --> 00:49:43,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, there's someone with a selfmade or like, dude, why is your hat sparkling?

553
00:49:43,604 --> 00:49:45,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, dude, can I trade for your hat?

554
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:56,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, random internet stranger, I am going to trade the most rarest hat ever to... I'm going to assume they just don't know how rare it is or something.

555
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:57,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they do.

556
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:58,582
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that ask do.

557
00:49:58,782 --> 00:50:01,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're that dumb.

558
00:50:01,203 --> 00:50:05,964
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually took out the tradable flag, so I can't even trade it if I wanted to.

559
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:12,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there were other problems that happened, like someone's account got hacked for it.

560
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:15,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just clamped that down.

561
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:17,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Over a freaking hat!

562
00:50:17,328 --> 00:50:18,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I know!

563
00:50:20,472 --> 00:50:21,613
[SPEAKER_01]: People like their EPing.

564
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:24,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think it went free to play?

565
00:50:24,377 --> 00:50:25,979
[SPEAKER_03]: It still makes money.

566
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:35,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't blame Valve at all for it, and especially since they're doing it in such a way that's much more open than they could have.

567
00:50:36,765 --> 00:50:37,746
[SPEAKER_02]: That they didn't need to?

568
00:50:38,646 --> 00:50:48,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was a story a few weeks ago that Newell was talking that they had to talk to PayPal and say, no, he isn't trading drugs.

569
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:50,072
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually is getting this from digital hats.

570
00:50:52,013 --> 00:50:53,533
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, so I've been playing TF2.

571
00:50:54,214 --> 00:50:56,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also been going back to Newgrounds.

572
00:50:58,015 --> 00:51:00,696
[SPEAKER_02]: and playing all the small little itty bitty things there.

573
00:51:02,016 --> 00:51:07,678
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one in particular I was really attracted to and I'm actually going to look it up.

574
00:51:08,618 --> 00:51:18,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It had like a death state so you either were alive and could do certain things or then you died and you could do other things and then get back to life and all that.

575
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,161
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a nice little...

576
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:24,663
[SPEAKER_04]: While you find the name of that, some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

577
00:51:25,204 --> 00:51:29,046
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, Sage just said he was fabulous, dropped the mic, and walked away.

578
00:51:29,746 --> 00:51:30,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he did.

579
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:30,947
[SPEAKER_04]: He did do that.

580
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:31,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't quite walk away.

581
00:51:31,948 --> 00:51:33,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of boxed in here in the seats.

582
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft is suggesting one called TF2NewbiesOnly.com.

583
00:51:38,912 --> 00:51:39,753
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're not a noob.

584
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:40,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

585
00:51:41,714 --> 00:51:42,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how to point and click.

586
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:46,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Revive is the name of it.

587
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:49,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a really nice little fun game.

588
00:51:50,397 --> 00:51:51,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I do recommend it.

589
00:51:51,157 --> 00:51:52,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and Harrison's like, congregate, please.

590
00:51:53,078 --> 00:51:55,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, and please, I've been on Newgrounds.

591
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,580
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have YouTube if it weren't for Newgrounds.

592
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go on the record in saying that.

593
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Newgrounds started when I was in high school, which was forever ago.

594
00:52:05,942 --> 00:52:07,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still ticking.

595
00:52:07,022 --> 00:52:07,823
[SPEAKER_02]: You better watch it.

596
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

597
00:52:10,165 --> 00:52:11,968
[SPEAKER_02]: How old are you again?

598
00:52:12,148 --> 00:52:13,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think I'm a little older.

599
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:16,875
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm not saying a number.

600
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright.

601
00:52:18,812 --> 00:52:46,123
[SPEAKER_04]: but um but anyway so yeah that that's been most of my time has been crawling around new grounds and TF2 oh and moving Tetris in real life yeah Tetris in real life uh Actdeft yes I do hum it too Actdeft in our chat room just to clarify a previous comment saying it's called newbies only to welcome new players but there are a lot of vets there so to be fair to that server um anything else for the gaming week you want to share before we go to me

602
00:52:47,143 --> 00:52:47,583
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to you.

603
00:52:47,844 --> 00:52:48,084
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

604
00:52:48,844 --> 00:52:51,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I don't have a lot of new stuff to talk about, so I'll just be real quick.

605
00:52:52,246 --> 00:52:53,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Continuing to progress in Diablo 3.

606
00:52:54,388 --> 00:52:56,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm officially way further than I was before.

607
00:52:56,869 --> 00:53:00,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in Act 3 now, which before the furthest I got was at the beginning of Act 2.

608
00:53:00,812 --> 00:53:03,313
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I guess I'm kind of enjoying it this time.

609
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:04,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even explain it.

610
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:05,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ask me why.

611
00:53:06,876 --> 00:53:11,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I think because I'm taking it at my own pace, and I'm actually...

612
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:14,142
[SPEAKER_04]: And exploring the auction house stuff a little bit.

613
00:53:14,222 --> 00:53:16,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the money auction house, but the gold one.

614
00:53:16,265 --> 00:53:19,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And kind of trying to figure out the ins and outs on how to make money there.

615
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:22,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of a fascinating little meta game in and of itself.

616
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:24,736
[SPEAKER_04]: But the real money auction house, forget it.

617
00:53:24,756 --> 00:53:26,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all that stuff is the real high-end stuff.

618
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, been playing Warcraft.

619
00:53:30,022 --> 00:53:33,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, more Mass Effect, but playing a lot of the multiplayer this week.

620
00:53:33,765 --> 00:53:38,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, there was just kind of like a... One night, we even did some streaming this week, didn't we, DarkSakura?

621
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:40,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was really... Shane?

622
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:43,934
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when my character was twitching and spasming on your screen.

623
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we were just laughing and having a good time.

624
00:53:45,635 --> 00:53:46,476
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really fun.

625
00:53:46,496 --> 00:53:47,497
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do more game streaming.

626
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:48,538
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually fun.

627
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:50,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, more Tomb Raider.

628
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Still getting closer to the end on that one.

629
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:53,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to lend it to me.

630
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:57,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I guess, if you'll actually play it, absolutely.

631
00:53:57,666 --> 00:54:00,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried playing Mass Effect, and now I bought it on PC.

632
00:54:00,928 --> 00:54:01,569
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.

633
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:03,830
[SPEAKER_04]: That is true.

634
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:07,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we'll finally get Jamie to talk about another game.

635
00:54:07,553 --> 00:54:10,495
[SPEAKER_04]: If for no other reason, I will loan her Tomb Raider for that fact.

636
00:54:10,535 --> 00:54:11,276
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, though?

637
00:54:11,356 --> 00:54:12,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I love To The Moon.

638
00:54:13,177 --> 00:54:13,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

639
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you played it?

640
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:14,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

641
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:15,798
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to play To the Moon.

642
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:16,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not played To the Moon.

643
00:54:16,738 --> 00:54:17,738
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to play To the Moon.

644
00:54:17,758 --> 00:54:18,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

645
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:19,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.

646
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:20,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Internet, you need to play To the Moon.

647
00:54:20,879 --> 00:54:22,860
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably where he's about middle-aged now.

648
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been sort of slowly going through it.

649
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Have tissues.

650
00:54:26,981 --> 00:54:27,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

651
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:28,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I already sobbed a little bit.

652
00:54:28,901 --> 00:54:31,082
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found my favorite line.

653
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:31,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you don't know.

654
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:32,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I found my favorite line in the game.

655
00:54:33,522 --> 00:54:36,423
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, that's the problem with you neurotypicals always telling us what to do.

656
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:39,064
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my favorite line in the game so far.

657
00:54:39,964 --> 00:54:42,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I did play Civ 5 because I had to try it.

658
00:54:42,285 --> 00:54:47,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody has built a custom mod that allows you to play as certain Mass Effect civilizations.

659
00:54:48,147 --> 00:54:49,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be a Krogan!

660
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:51,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they have those yet.

661
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,808
[SPEAKER_04]: They have Asari and they have Volus.

662
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:54,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of fun.

663
00:54:55,969 --> 00:54:58,490
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can talk like this the entire time?

664
00:55:00,245 --> 00:55:07,311
[SPEAKER_04]: alright, there we go that's that for now that's my gaming week, let's move on that's the best hat ever

[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's like, throw me a party.

00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:48,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

670
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my present.

671
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:52,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 500.

672
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,411
[SPEAKER_01]: And I quit.

673
00:55:54,812 --> 00:55:55,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit.

674
00:55:57,733 --> 00:55:57,953
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

675
00:55:58,273 --> 00:55:59,694
[SPEAKER_04]: See if somebody quits on episode 500.

676
00:56:00,374 --> 00:56:01,955
[SPEAKER_04]: That alone is worth tuning in for.

677
00:56:02,215 --> 00:56:03,815
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I should have a diva breakdown.

678
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:05,176
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about time for me to have one.

679
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:06,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Rumble U No, Rumble Me

680
00:56:32,611 --> 00:56:36,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but the system is the Wii U, not the Wii Me.

681
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:38,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Wii Me would be really weird.

682
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I call my cat.

683
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:45,793
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want Pokemon to rumble you, you have issues of fandom beyond anything that DarkSakura has for Garrus, I'm just saying.

684
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,701
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make them rumble you if you want because they do sell some individual figures that go along with this game.

685
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:53,161
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

686
00:56:53,321 --> 00:57:00,303
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be using the near field communication technology of the Wii U to whore this game like Skylanders.

687
00:57:00,663 --> 00:57:02,043
[SPEAKER_05]: The inevitable has happened.

688
00:57:02,143 --> 00:57:04,144
[SPEAKER_05]: They have said, hey, guess what?

689
00:57:05,044 --> 00:57:10,385
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a game that involves collectible figures and they're making money off these figures like crazy.

690
00:57:10,425 --> 00:57:10,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I like money.

691
00:57:11,963 --> 00:57:12,664
[SPEAKER_05]: We like money.

692
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:14,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo needs more money.

693
00:57:14,185 --> 00:57:15,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what they're doing.

694
00:57:16,247 --> 00:57:17,828
[SPEAKER_05]: They're launching with seven figures.

695
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, one of those figures being Pikachu.

696
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:22,091
[SPEAKER_05]: They're reasonably priced, I guess.

697
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:24,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess 1,800 yen.

698
00:57:27,015 --> 00:57:29,737
[SPEAKER_05]: 1,800 yen is the actual price of the game.

699
00:57:30,418 --> 00:57:31,739
[SPEAKER_05]: 19 bucks, 20 bucks, whatever.

700
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,621
[SPEAKER_05]: And the figures themselves are around 2 bucks or 200 yen.

701
00:57:34,962 --> 00:57:35,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So 2 bucks each.

702
00:57:35,942 --> 00:57:37,724
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if you look at those figures, you're like...

703
00:57:37,944 --> 00:57:38,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokemon Premium

704
00:57:54,483 --> 00:57:55,965
[SPEAKER_05]: It's evolved into more money!

705
00:58:09,571 --> 00:58:11,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero Meltdown phase.

706
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:20,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I am really curious how retail stores are going to react to this because there's going to be a point, you know, there's already, like at the Target or Toys R Us, there's already like a Skylanders aisle.

707
00:58:20,724 --> 00:58:28,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it's going to, there's going to be Disney Infinity, there's going to be Pokemon, like there's going to come a point where the retailers are going to say, enough.

708
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:30,031
[SPEAKER_04]: No more.

709
00:58:30,652 --> 00:58:30,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

710
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:34,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it's now a competition to see which one of these we're going to carry.

711
00:58:35,073 --> 00:58:37,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, here's a thought, and totally on speculation train.

712
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:53,141
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing all these more physical item things so that sort of a bait and switch of going more digital for most things and then just having enough more retail presence things of things that are justifiable beyond bits.

713
00:58:53,686 --> 00:59:00,674
[SPEAKER_04]: hmm interesting just a thought interesting I mean a possible replacement for the software aisle in the future yeah oh my gosh

714
00:59:01,363 --> 00:59:10,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my thing, is all the Pokemon that are included in this little pack or whatever, or the figures that they have available, they all look the same.

715
00:59:11,109 --> 00:59:21,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm serious, I don't know shit about Pokemon, and I'm not about to pretend that I do, but all of these Pokemon in this screenshot look exactly the same, except for color palette swaps or something like that.

716
00:59:21,615 --> 00:59:23,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just, they all look the same.

717
00:59:24,196 --> 00:59:31,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought of a fun game for a future episode of OLR is that we'll show Loki pictures of various Pokemon and say, what do you think this one's called?

718
00:59:31,643 --> 00:59:35,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine, because I don't know.

719
00:59:37,697 --> 01:00:03,390
[SPEAKER_05]: it's all just multiple choice I'm pretty good at guessing seriously I'm not going to say that they're not going to make money from this because there's people like Shane that will buy anything that has to do with Pokemon so I'm not surprised and he will get other people to buy it too I'm sure he's super excited to hear that that Pokemon Pikachu system is coming out over here he was trying to convince me I needed one

720
01:00:05,748 --> 01:00:06,629
[SPEAKER_05]: He's your pusher, man.

721
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:07,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you.

722
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:09,933
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

723
01:00:11,394 --> 01:00:12,015
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gonna try.

724
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,738
[SPEAKER_05]: My thing is, I don't know if it's gonna be successful.

725
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:16,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that, you know...
