Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 497 for this March the 17th, 2013.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Happy St. Patrick's Day to you, or Happy Luigi Day as the case may be, cause you know, Luigi wears green.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, gamer lols, anything gamer, and maybe a little bit of other stuff too.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts. Say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Jamie Summers has been replaced by a monster on tonight's show.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
By one of those little gurgly things in WoW.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, the murlocs?

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki, who ate a murloc for dinner.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I, yeah, sort of.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I helped.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How you doing Loki?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm doing fine, just making sure I'm being picked up on the mic.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes, your mic is good.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Alright.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't know what that was about. Random.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That was Pope Francis actually intervening and hoping that you wouldn't be heard tonight.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're gonna be still trying to get rid of that old Pope smell.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Anyhow, say hello. We have a special guest joining us tonight in studio.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to give a big hello and welcome back to an old friend of Orange Lounge Radio, who I haven't seen in a couple months.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So I'm super excited he took the drive all the way from the Bay Area just to be here with us tonight.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Say hello to Seg.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello OLR, I missed you so.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I missed you too.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Would you buy me?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm just kidding.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How are you?

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, what a year.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You've had a very interesting year.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, very much so. A lot of changes, a lot of good things and a lot of not so good things.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Not dead yet, despite the universe's best efforts.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And it's going to be an exciting year coming up.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, let me talk to you a little bit more in just a minute here.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But I do want to give a plug for our chat room because some of the folks live tonight might want to chat with you, Seg.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And they can do so by joining our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In case you didn't know, it is a live show.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's a podcast too, but we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network,

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show every Sunday night.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And if you are in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, you can ask Seg some questions.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But not everybody might know, like, what y'all have been involved with in the gaming universe.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So tell us a little bit about yourself for the listeners that might not know.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So I make video games with computers.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's good, as opposed to with sticks and stones.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes. First recipient, just to TLDR my history, first recipient of Bachelor of Fine Arts.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Make sure you're right in that mic so you're good and loud.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
First recipient of Bachelor of Fine Arts in New Media at Emerson College in Boston, originally from Detroit, Dearborn.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Worked for over five years at Telltale Games, making over 60 titles, more or less.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Episodes are weird.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I also co-founded UMLoud, which is a rock band charity concert in San Francisco and broadcasted around the world for Child's Play Charity.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And stuff.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And other things. Is that enough?

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, it's perfect. That's lots of stuff.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, we talk about UMLoud. Let's start with UMLoud, because we've talked a lot about UMLoud on the show.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And, you know, we've all participated. We've gone to past events and so forth.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You know, it's a great thing that the whole, you know, Northern California community really gets involved with.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And now, really, the world, too.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Have you been surprised in a positive way at how well UMLoud's been received?

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's, you know, it's been, it's such a crazy journey, this thing.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Because, I mean, I first, I was actually one of the first to play Guitar Hero, because I play-tested Guitar Hero 1 way back in the day in Central Square.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And I always wanted to see an event that focused on performance rather than score.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because the score didn't really interest me too much, so much as the performance aspect.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And, you know, a few years when I moved over here to California, the opportunity arose to really make an event that focused on performance.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And to do so in a way that benefited the community.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I knew people wanted this sort of event once they figured out, you know, once we were able to communicate this isn't a score-based event.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Because when you use score, it's always like, oh, there's that one person that's crazy good that'll never beat.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And it just, would just shut off many people.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Whereas for our event, with the exception of the Headliner program, which is something a little bit special, we don't audition or anything.

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Literally any idiot can do it.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's the beauty of the internet.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And it's just, you know, the first year, we had a few bands that actually did the costume stuff and all that, but that was just the first time doing it.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And now it's just, it's a thing. People pitch me band ideas and all this.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And just the amount of talent that comes out of it.

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And just the creativity and the fervor of excitement that comes out of I Joomloud is just absolutely amazing.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And it wouldn't happen if it weren't for the amazing year-round team that helps put on this show together.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Literally, I mean, it is not just me.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I hate it when people are like, oh, it's your thing.

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Like, no, no, no, no, no, it's not my thing.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It is our thing.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And, you know, we've been able to raise quite a bit of money.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How much did you pull in this last year?

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This last year, we're looking, it's around $41,000 this time around.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, I remember it was about $40,000, yeah.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah, we got a few things also rolled in late.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So it's about $41,000.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Not a bad chunk of change.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Not bad. Not bad at all.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's for a great cause too.

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's fun to walk on.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Jamie, of course, you know, I know did a lot of graphic design and stuff for it.

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So, yeah, it's a fun way for everybody to get involved.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you have a lot of people that are kind of throwing themselves at you going, let me help?

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, you know, once we get, you know, we're definitely going to be expanding more this year.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We really want to expand the headliner program, which was a wild success this year.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
To explain what that is, so Umlaut to Perform, it's a donation.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Last year was $200 last year for a band package.

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And you split that between your band members.

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So it's not that much at all.

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's $200 a band, but if your band has, what, seven people, three vocalists?

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, you know, we have an upper limit of seven just to help manage the stuff, you know, the cards and all that and all that.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But it's, it doesn't have to be seven.

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So you can't be like Gwar, getting up and having a big cup.

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, you can't be, well, you know, there's a stage limit as well.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But, well, like one of the bands, this is one of the headliners, French Kiss,

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
incorporated other friends that had confetti poppers everywhere.

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And we earned our cleaning fee this year with them.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, man, just confetti everywhere.

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
How's the response from the people who can't be there in person?

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Have you found that your internet presence has really grown?

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We had a real boon with a partnership with Twitch.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They featured us on the website and that just shot up.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And also with Tim Schafer hosting was definitely an attraction.

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
How did you, that's, thank you for reminding me of that because that was quite the feature for Umlaut this year.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How did you manage that?

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, Joe had already worked with Tim Schafer and his team, Joe Market.

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He's one of the co-founders, one of the fellow co-founders and board members.

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And he had already worked with him on the GDC awards and all that.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And we were looking for a host and he did the co-found.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hey, would you be interested in this?

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And they were, you know, he was, and we had him host our show.

125
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Awesome.

126
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah.

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I mean, we kept that under wraps for quite a few months because we wanted it to be Tim Schafer's hosting and here's where you buy tickets.

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Here's a great question for somebody that's been in the industry as long as you have since you brought up keeping secrets.

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And you've worked, you know, you worked for Telltale for many years and obviously they had some huge games over those years.

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You have to keep a lot of secrets when you work in this industry.

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
How hard is that?

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Very.

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The worst, the hardest secret I ever had to keep was keeping from my sister, Carolyn, the fact that we were working on Tales of Monkey Island.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That was the hardest because my sister and I grew up on the scum era and I leaned more towards the Sam and Max.

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
She leaned more towards the Monkey Island side.

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But, you know, there's definitely shared love between the two.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But I had to keep that secret for much longer than I would have liked.

138
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I certainly heard about it from her.

139
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I bet. I bet.

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I told her a half hour before we were going live with the announcement just so I could say that I told her before.

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But if you guys have 30 minutes before, that's great.

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

143
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you guys have questions for SEG, live.vognetwork.com, you can ask whatever you'd like, within reason.

144
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Either about UMLOUD or A Space Between Studios or whatever.

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I do want to talk about your new studio, but I had another quick question about UMLOUD because I know this has got to be something that's on your mind.

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's on a lot of people's mind when it comes to rock band.

147
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They've announced no more DLC after, what is it, two weeks?

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's like the last DLC we're ever going to see.

149
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Which, you know, the end had to happen at some point, right?

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's hard to be upset about the end of rock band DLC when no other game in the history of gaming has been supported the way the rock band has been.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, five years.

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Let's be real.

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And with as much as they've got, right?

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So, are you worried, though, that like, uh-oh, if this means that rock band is sunsetting, what's going to happen to UMLOUD?

155
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Well, you know, this whole shinding does not happen if not for the support of the community.

156
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And that's ultimately what everyone comes together for.

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's what this whole thing happens, is the community.

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And I see no slowing down from the community of wanting to do this event.

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So, that's what I point to, not just to blindly say, oh, yeah, we're still going to do it.

160
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No, the evidence of all the people that just want to pour in all the performances who just...

161
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:16,000
To me, our marketing challenge for our event is getting people to experience for the first time UMLOUD, whether it's online or in person.

162
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Because we know that once people experience it, they're coming back next year or really heavily regretting it.

163
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So, we know we have a very good event on our hands.

164
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We know we have an event that people love, that people want to participate in.

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And harmonics moving on from rock band hasn't altered that.

166
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So, maybe it'll be a dance party with Dance Central in a couple years.

167
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Surely you've kicked that idea around.

168
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We've kicked the idea, yeah.

169
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Obvious conclusion, right?

170
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I mean, it's hard to do that on stage because, well, for one, it's only two people.

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And then it's not a main stage thing.

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And we really want to push as many bands and people on stage just because we're only doing it one night.

173
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We want to make sure that we get as many people to experience the big stage.

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It really is the performance of it all, too.

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And it's funny that if you look back at the history of this show, we started around, what, DDR?

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We used to do episodes of this show live from Dance Dance Revolution tournaments and stuff.

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So, let me tell you, they'll always be somewhere in gaming, like a performance game.

178
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I think we've seen that ever since, really.

179
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I guess DDR probably was the first of that that I could think of.

180
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It was a performance-based game.

181
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I want to see a visual K-themed band next year.

182
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's my personal challenge out to anybody, by the way.

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Anything is possible.

184
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I try not to meddle in the affairs of bands, but I just want to put out there,

185
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I would love to see someone do a mash-up and or a Weird Al rendition of a song.

186
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Because the game's on no-fail, and you don't worry about score anyways.

187
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I wish people would explore the space.

188
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's what we do at my house.

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, I've seen people do, because Born This Way, right?

190
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So you can do the whole, like, perform this way.

191
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You can totally do it.

192
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's good times.

193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Isn't Lola in there?

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Because I think we've done Yoda.

195
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Perhaps.

196
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What else do I want to ask about?

197
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, one other question I got about Umlaut, and then I want to talk about some of your other projects, too.

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Do you get people, since you have had success on the internet,

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and you're recognized on Twitch as a national thing now, it's not just something that's NorCal,

200
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
do you get people coming to you going,

201
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Segg, how do I have an Umlaut in Tallahassee, Florida?

202
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Or how do I do an Umlaut in Titicaca?

203
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There's definitely a request for that.

204
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Bring Umlaut to me.

205
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There's sort of two prongs to that answer.

206
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
As far as the Umlaut branding, we don't know exactly how to, for us under the Umlaut brand,

207
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:15,000
to franchise and do it in such a way that we can ensure that the quality and the organization is up to our standards

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
to make sure that things are above orders.

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's not that I imagine people being shady about it, but it's not something we can just go,

210
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, yeah, I'll use the Umlaut brand and all that.

211
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So we're protective on it because we want to make sure we do it right if we branch out with the Umlaut brand.

212
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But not like you need us, either.

213
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It all comes down to, do you have enough people and enough partnerships you can start to make a thing together

214
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and to rent out a place?

215
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And if you have enough of a community around to pull out the rock band and make it happen.

216
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's more event planning than the rock band part because, believe me,

217
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
as the sound techs at DNA Lounge, where we have our event, have told me we're one of the easier shows to tech.

218
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I bet.

219
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah, it's microphones and looped back and the monitors, but the rest of the instruments.

220
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That part's the easiest, right?

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, yeah, and you know, it's funny because we get this, even here at Orange Ons Radio,

222
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
we're coming up on our 500th episode in a few weeks, right?

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So a lot of people are like, Hey, you guys should have an OLR Con or a VoG network to do a VoG Con or something like that.

224
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm like, do you know what it takes to plan a convention?

225
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It would not be pretty.

226
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Like the better idea is to take it like Fonami.

227
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Hey, don't you want like an OLR night or something?

228
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah.

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Try to leash on to something else.

230
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That's the only way it's going to happen.

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I think part of a first gen con, its first ever, it was called Ground Zero Con in Mobile, Alabama.

232
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It was held in.

233
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's Christmas at Ground Zero.

234
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
No, not that one.

235
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It was, my friend had this like gaming group called Ground Zero Techno Mage.

236
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Okay.

237
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And he ran a con in the theater room in the school's student center.

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But everything's got to start somewhere. It'd be little, but you know, it's possible.

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

240
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I think he started it with 200 bucks.

241
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The proto umlaut was actually Fuendrauser, which was in a bar, 200 capacity.

242
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah.

243
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And I didn't get involved, but I went to it and that packed the place up.

244
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And that's like, okay, if they have advertising able to get that many people rolling in, and then it was a scale up from there.

245
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If that was all umlaut ever was, now obviously it's turned into something bigger, but even if it's just that, you're still raising money for a good cause.

246
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Exactly.

247
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So why not, why not dream a little bigger?

248
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
All right.

249
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Speaking of dream big, you started your own game studio.

250
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah.

251
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay.

252
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No pressure.

253
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay.

254
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You were at Telltale.

255
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Layoffs happen in the industry.

256
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It doesn't matter who you work for, right?

257
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
These types of things happen.

258
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So you worked on, did you work on Walking Dead?

259
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes.

260
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So that's got to feel real good though, that you were a part of that because that was such a huge success, right?

261
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

262
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Working through the years and building up the studio and really having all of us really come to a point where we're really recognized for our work is just a testament to the years of dedication we all put in to make that go.

263
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So, you know, there's that old saying, when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade.

264
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So you certainly have done that in some regard with this whole thing because, you know, unfortunately you took that bad news that happened there.

265
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And you know, that's just an inevitable fact of that industry, unfortunately, is that, you know, as projects come and go, people come and go, right?

266
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We've reported it.

267
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
How many times on this show?

268
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
How many times on this show?

269
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But here we are now, you know, that'll happen at the end of last year.

270
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And now here we are March of this year.

271
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And you're like, okay, I'm not going to be the type that just sits on my butt and watches Oprah all day.

272
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm going to.

273
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Oprah's off the air.

274
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
She has a network now.

275
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What's the line when life gives you lemons, you demand to see life's manager.

276
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But you've turned that into a game studio.

277
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So where how did that did you just did you wake up one day and go, you know, I should start a game studio.

278
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Well, I should really talk more about the project and, you know, the studio kind of comes after that a little bit.

279
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And I wanted to, you know, after the layoff, I was thinking of why why I love video games so much.

280
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why why I've dedicated my my life, my career to video games and all that.

281
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And I've I've had this idea floating around of making a a a project that explained how video games communicate as an art form.

282
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And it's you know, I mean, I went through school for it and actually kind of made my own curriculum because I was the first person to go through my program.

283
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And there's a lot of things that we know, but no one, you know, very few have really pinned it down, put some definitions onto it, put some context on it and delivered in a way that a general public would actually participate, you know, like play playthrough and all that.

284
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So I wanted to make a video game, a video games, trying to wrap my head around this idea a lot.

285
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I know we talk about like artistic video games. We think a lot about like Flower and Journey and other things that that game company have done.

286
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The art in that maybe even like so much the art of storytelling in a game like Walking Dead.

287
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Certainly it affected a lot of people and it's storytelling.

288
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So what's what's the difference between like a artsy video game? Because that's not what you're talking about.

289
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You're not talking about making an artsy video game.

290
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You're talking about making a video game that tell like.

291
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm trying to wrap my head. Well, think of think, you know, in high school or in college, you know, there are film appreciation classes like a film appreciation one on one class where, you know, that class you're walking in there.

292
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You know, there's it's not like you haven't experienced film before, but those classes are to bring some terminology and some understanding and perspective about how artists use this particular form of media to communicate ideas.

293
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I want to make the video games appreciation one on one class.

294
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And rather than making it a book where I would be going like, oh, this concept, like in this game, assuming you played that game.

295
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But if you're going in for a video game appreciation textbook, you know, you can assume that they haven't played that particular game.

296
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So rather, I wanted to make a game. So instead of just textually writing about it and talking about it and all that, it's like, no, here is the concept.

297
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's put it out in front of you. Let's have you experience it the way it's intended to in that form of media.

298
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So you can actually really get a deep understanding by doing rather than wrote.

299
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So this is the game that will make Roger Ebert understand.

300
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, you know, I'm trying not. Well, I will say that I'm not the piece won't spend much time of, you know, trying to prove, you know, answer the question, is video games art?

301
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Because it's just simply, yes, they are. Let's move on.

302
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's that's that's the opinionated opinion I'm starting with this piece of just like, yes, there are. Let's go into it.

303
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So you know, you know, the result you want. How do you how we how are we going to get there?

304
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Good question.

305
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So I have a few people that are working on it sort of part time and part part time on it.

306
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I have Jessica Johnson being a writer for me and being sort of the foil and keeping me into focus of the actual content of it.

307
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I have Dan as a programmer that's very interested in working with me on the project.

308
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But really, it comes down to is funding, to be quite honest.

309
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And the bugger about this kind of project is I usually when you go out for funding for a game and all that,

310
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:05,000
when you're doing it professionally, air quotes, is that you say, well, here's similar games that we're trying to make.

311
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And here was their return on investment. Here's where their profitability and here's where we're going to twist and make something different.

312
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't have any game to point to that is anywhere similar to this.

313
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No one has made the real the video game about video games to the kind of depth and length that I'm searching for with this piece.

314
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So it turns me to do the inevitable Kickstarter.

315
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I was going to ask because, yeah, we like a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to ask you.

316
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But now that we're in 2013, is Kickstarter the answer for this?

317
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That currently is my answer.

318
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Or Indiegogo or any of those.

319
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm doing Kickstarter because I want to if I'm doing this, I want to do it in a way that actually funds the game.

320
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And that's going to be six figures easy because I want to respect the people that are going to work on this for me.

321
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And that means paying them decently.

322
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So it ends up being a six figure.

323
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The figure and Indiegogo is just not producing those kinds of adult results consistently.

324
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
There is a branding of Kickstarter that you can't dismiss.

325
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I mean, sure, I would love to have, you know, some capital investment come in, swoop down and make it go.

326
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But barring that, I really need to prove that there's an audience for this.

327
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And really the available way to do that in this case, I believe, is through Kickstarter.

328
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Because then I can say here are these people who actually put money down to that actually want to have this thing happen.

329
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
How are you how are you preparing for this Kickstarter?

330
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So, you know, it's a lot of, you know, this budget for one.

331
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I have a spreadsheet that is so dynamic.

332
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Well, thank God you've had to do some financial planning for UMLoud in the past.

333
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, I know, right?

334
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You're not going into this totally blind.

335
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah.

336
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You know, I have quite a bit of experience of doing budgets and all that.

337
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And I have to say that I've had a really good business teacher and that's my father or Uncle Ed to you.

338
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Hi, Dad.

339
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I think I see him in chat.

340
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah.

341
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
He had a comment earlier in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com about Tim Schafer at UMLoud and that he was a great addition to UMLoud this year.

342
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And Uncle Ed is a great addition to UMLoud.

343
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
He does the books and everything, among many other things.

344
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But anyway, but he is a former Ford employee.

345
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And I learned I learned enough about business to go about knowing enough about business to know when I need an adult.

346
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And which, man, that's a bit, you know, through the years, really realizing how special and unique that is, because, boy, we all have seen people who really don't know how to business and don't understand for themselves.

347
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Heck yeah.

348
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
There's been so many moments during the times of OLR in the past where, you know, we're trying to do something.

349
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's like, I need an adult.

350
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So, you know, I'm not going in this completely blindly, but so that, you know, there's making the budget and figure out, OK, how much you know, how much is needed, what is going to be the markup of Kickstarter fees and credit card fees and all that.

351
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And then the fulfillment fees of the actual prizes and all that, that run down from how much is bandwidth going to cost to deliver on final thing to all the physical items, what's good, what's not good.

352
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You know, and trying to balancing all those numbers so that if this thing gets green lighted, I'm not going, well, I have these thousands of dollars worth of stuff I have to pay for in order to get to people.

353
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, crap.

354
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You may not have the answer to this question yet, but let me try to throw it out there anyway, just because this is the question that people will be asking once this goes live.

355
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But, you know, why am I going to want to donate to this?

356
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Why will I want to donate and help space between studios create this game?

357
00:28:39,000 --> 00:29:02,000
What this game is intending to do is be the community's way of illustrating to the rest of the world why video games, why we love video games in the way and why we think video games is unique as a form of art that communicates ideas.

358
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And to answer that in the way of what makes video games work to communicate ideas, why are we attracted to the things that we like about video games?

359
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Why are we dissuade about the things that don't work about video games?

360
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Will you be able to answer the question why we've been sitting here for the past 11 years every Sunday night talking about this crap?

361
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Well, you know, that's more in the psychology.

362
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And that was the nice way of saying nobody can answer that.

363
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That would be an exercise.

364
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That would be a true exercise in recursive thinking.

365
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
He's a game designer, not a head doctor.

367
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I didn't mean to make it about us.

368
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's about us.

369
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's on our show about that.

370
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But no, this is this is this is also a piece.

371
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I mean, we don't have this fully fleshed out as far as the outline, because I also want to hear from the community at large.

372
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And this is development and players of what are the things about video games we would want to communicate to people who may not know or play video games all that well, but have an interest just to know more.

373
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And not and I don't think throwing people to a particular any one particular game is going to begin to answer what the diaspora of video games are.

374
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So this is going to be a piece that is a sort of neutral ground where it doesn't make an assumption of what experience level and what you've played before.

375
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That's both in the not played before or super experience.

376
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm not making initial assumptions of audience that way will customize based off of how you approach things.

377
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:08,000
We'll take those creative choices there, but really want to present something that that we can go, hey, oh, you want to know more about video games?

378
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You just just get this game and play and then we'll talk about it after.

379
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And if you really want to know, it's going to cost you because we hear gamers love microtransactions.

380
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Oh, no, no, I'm not doing that now.

381
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah, I do.

382
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Will your game be always online required?

383
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
No.

384
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Get out now.

385
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
All right.

386
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
No, I, you know, well, I'll have the game that's DRM free.

387
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Windows, Linux, Mac.

388
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You know, no.

389
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Is it coming to the OUYA?

390
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Well, you know, that's the other plan, you know, other consoles and platforms and definitely not saying no to I'm sticking to the big three desktop platforms because I can 100 percent promise that 100 percent go and all that.

391
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
We are using Unity, so it's not gating other platforms outright.

392
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It's just I'd rather promise things we can deliver on.

393
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And it's not that I mean, there are other avenues that I am exploring.

394
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Sure.

395
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I just know that I want to promise.

396
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Don't second, don't write checks.

397
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Your ass can't cash.

398
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Right. I heard that before.

399
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
All right.

400
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's not like I'm mentioning that Minecraft will be on a dot, dot, dot.

401
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
If I'm torn on whether to ask you this question or not, because this question can be perceived as a negative from our chat room.

402
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But I think it's a tough question.

403
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And I've been through worse.

404
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm going to say if you're going to take it to the Internet, you're going to get this.

405
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So let me ask you this question from Ross.

406
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Do you see in the chat room that says so.

407
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So this is a testament to the community's insecurity and need for approval.

408
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Are gamers insecure?

409
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Well, no, it's not it's not a statement.

410
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's not the impression of just gamers need to themselves need to like defend or whatever.

412
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's just there hasn't been a really good academic text that's approachable.

413
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Could this be a celebration?

414
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yes.

415
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Of gaming.

416
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's a celebration of gaming.

417
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I mean, I'm making my pitch a little bit geared towards more of people who have played games, because I think if you're listening to this show, I can make that assumption.

418
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That's that's a good.

419
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah.

420
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Good way of thinking.

421
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Yeah.

422
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Just say it.

423
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Just, you know, no judging.

424
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But, you know.

425
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Well, going back to the academic approach, though, what about having it as a tool for like, say, officials, you know, people who are making those legislation about.

426
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Well, I don't want to I don't want the piece to become an out and out political tool.

427
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm making very, very consciously not going into topical things or even current topics that I'm including.

428
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Like, for example, I'm not going to touch behavior of online chat and XBLA and all that.

429
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Comment threads on the Internet.

430
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Because that's not there's nothing artistic.

431
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Just keep Tumblr out of it because all anyone does is talk about Mass Effect.

432
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
But like, you know, like I'm bringing that up.

433
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's not even so much like this is a text of the community.

434
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
This is not a text.

435
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
This is just how video games communicate as an art form.

436
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But to to that end, as tools, one of the plans I have for the the Kickstarter tier reward tiers is you get a digital copy, but you can pick a library classroom, whatever academic it's, you know, whatever can be leaving a little bit broad.

437
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You know, some people if people come up with something that we haven't thought about that would fit in their community, community service, community service, whatever.

438
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But a kit that's so far speccing us to physical DVDs, a site license documentation saying, yes, this institution has a site license for the game.

439
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So it's not limited to the two physical copies and two physical copies of the softcover handbook that we're also going to produce as a sort of companion piece with it.

440
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And that's a you know, you get the thing, but then you can send out a thing and that's going to be on the little on the little more upper range because that's an expensive share, you know, more expensive than a digitally downloadable thing.

441
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But, you know, I am putting the cut ins for library in that educational text, but I'm also not trying to make this edutainment.

442
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You know, this isn't just the pure academic. I'm trying to make I'm trying to take the approach.

443
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:58,000
This is actually more speaking to where I want to go in a studio perspective is I want to take my my approach of how I've approached all of these licensed properties and all that that I worked in and telltale and all that.

444
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Where I take this canon from strong bad and, you know, it has it has this very well documented wiki, which was such a boon.

445
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I have to say that the Homestar Wiki helped out so much by taking the approach and care I've done to all these fictional franchises and take that same approach, but to non fictional things where the canon is reality.

446
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So and understanding video games is the piece that is my first piece in in that approach, because what I guess for the most part when it comes to edutainment or serious games,

447
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm not trying to make a complete blanket statement, but it just there just seems to be this disconnect of all the all the rich development and decisions being made on fictional games that are wonderful and awesome.

448
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But it's just not transferring over to other fields and other things that just that would really benefit from it.

449
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And this is sort of my my particular answer to try and give the perspective of we don't necessarily need to do straight straight up fiction work with our art form.

450
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Well, you've got quite quite a path ahead of you until you get to the end.

451
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I do kind of want to wrap up so you move on, talk about the weekend news.

452
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But if somebody wants to keep tabs on your project, on the Kickstarter, that'll be coming eventually, how can they do that?

453
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Spacebetweenstudios.com and it has all the social media, blah, blah, blah.

454
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The Twitters, the Facebooks.

455
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The Twitters, the Facebooks, the Google Plus even, because why not?

456
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And oh, no, Harrison's there?

457
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
What's up, Harrison? Sorry, I'm totally reading Chad and totally distracting myself. Damn you, Harrison.

458
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It took us forever. We used to do the same thing. It would be like our show would be us reading the chat.

459
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah, well, I'm just seeing and Bobby going Harrison.

460
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I would actually love SAG because there are there is kind of like a spirited debate going on about, you know, what what is what is the purpose of this?

461
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So I would love for you to get actually read your chat room after after we're done talking here and we get into the news.

462
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But so Spacebetweenstudios.com and on the Twitters and all that stuff.

463
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I know this is probably so early, but I'd be made fun of if I didn't ask this as a commentator.

464
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Any idea on the time frame? Any time, time assuming Green Line and everything.

465
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:48,000
If if the Kickstarter passes, passes and I'm able to be solvent on that, I'm currently looking at it.

466
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Well, it'd be ambitious if I said December 2014, but it's probably going to be January 2015 for digital release.

467
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And I'm purposefully putting a two month block of the physical releases of stuff because I want to make sure things are.

468
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Completely bug free.

469
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Before I meant the final physical disks or anything, but everyone would get the digital when it's, you know, I'm not spinning hairs there.

470
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Well, good luck.

471
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'll need it.

472
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I, I, I, I am so I just want to I can't wait to just see it.

473
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You know what I mean? Like, it's it's one thing to kind of hear you describe it.

474
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And then I'm kind of like, I just can't wait to kind of like jumping because there is so, you know, when you think about it, less like a celebration.

475
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I mean, you know what we're talking about here.

476
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I mean, this this show, my life would be dramatically different if video games didn't exist.

477
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Right. And, you know, I'm sure we all have that story of mom growing up saying you keep playing those games.

478
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You'll never amount to anything. Isn't that right, Uncle Ed?

479
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Now, well, video video games have helped you raise over the years, probably one hundred thousand dollars at this point for charity.

480
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Right. Over the five. We're at 40.

481
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
OK, well, it's about I'm going to say 80K.

482
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I mean, regardless, a huge number.

483
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And that is because of your love of video games, our love for video games.

484
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You know, wanting to perform that, wanting to, you know, show the community gamers aren't just crazy people on Xbox with guns that shoot children.

485
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You know, that's not what gamers are at all.

486
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The the one point I do want to make and then we can actually continue on.

487
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:48,000
When with the Kickstarter and all that, I I am and you can you can you can hold me to the fire in this.

488
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You when we go into development with this, you are going to hear from us constantly.

489
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,000
We're going to make sure we do at least once a month general like, you know, what what we did in the past month thing.

490
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But it's also trying to be available in forums and all that.

491
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So we're not going to be one of those kickstarters that, like, don't say anything for a few months and everyone's like, ah.

492
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You know, so we and this piece won't exist if it won't if the community doesn't participate with it.

493
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So, you know, this isn't I mean, also, you know, yes, ultimately we make final decisions with the piece, but it is not going to be in a vacuum.

494
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It is going to need everyone else's participation.

495
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I love these comments in the chat room. I've got I've got to read these before we move on.

496
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I haven't been looking. Sorry, John.

497
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Harrison Pink in our chat room, H.G. Pink says, everyone back say he's a smart guy who loves games and won't steal from you.

498
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Oh, thank you, Harrison. I miss you, man.

499
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Uncle Ed just defending himself a little bit in chat. So I think it's fair to read this.

500
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I gave you the TRS 80 in the early 80s. Your mother's the one that had issues with it.

501
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
That's why I was saying like that. That was like that's why I met with that comment.

502
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Is that right? That mom said that Uncle Ed.

503
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Fair enough. Fair enough. All right.

504
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Well, again, best of luck to you, not just with Space Between Studios, but with UMLoud, you know, going into this year and whatever else may come.

505
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You will be a PAX East as an attendee.

506
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I am a crazy person because I'm doing PAX this week.

507
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
We leave hopefully Tuesday. Apparently this is going to be fun time weather, so we'll see.

508
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But Tuesday, Sin and I will be going to Boston.

509
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And it's bless Sin, her birthday is Wednesday and I'm throwing her a birthday party in Boston to which she knows no one there.

510
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
She has never met anyone there because she doesn't know anyone in Boston.

511
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
There's one friend from her from here that's also coming along with like everyone else is like, meet my friends.

512
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Parties with strangers can be the best kind.

513
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Yes, they can. But so so I'll be at PAX this weekend.

514
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I think I make it make a sign that says, ask me about video games and park myself somewhere and see what happens.

515
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Why not? Yeah, exactly. It works for the free hugs guy. I know. Right.

516
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And then you're going to GDC and then GDC because I'm I'm a crazy person and I get back the Monday.

517
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I mean, GDC starts Monday, but I have the Wednesday through Friday pass.

518
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But apparently there's stuff I can go to on the Tuesday.

519
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
So I'm going to go to the it's like the Facebook day and the Google day.

520
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's all these sponsored ones and I figured, hey, with Pocky, come equipped with Pocky.

521
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Why? You are right. Free candy.

522
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You can be a stranger with candy. Yes.

523
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:46,000
OK, so and by the way, just, you know, Uncle Ed said in chat, ouch, she just hit me.

524
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
There you go. That's that's hilarious. Well, have fun at PAX East, have fun at GDC.

525
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So apparently, if the listeners want to say hi to you at PAX East, talk to you in person about this.

526
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Look for the guy who has the sign that says, ask me about video games.

527
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Perfect. I'm sure at some point you will find the VOG contingent, Bobby Blackwell.

528
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm sure they'll find me. They'll find you. Absolutely. Absolutely. Let's be realistic here.

529
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
There is a social media that I think you should add to the list. Tumblr.

530
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Oh, God. Oh, oh, there is much wank on Tumblr, but much spreading of information.

531
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Don't I'm not hating on Tumblr. I'm not I would never want to incur that wrath.

532
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But Tumblr is almost all social media for Tumblr. Tumblr is a very interesting place.

533
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I love the gifts. Yeah, there's a few people I thought friends that I follow on on the Tumblr.

534
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I do not have a Tumblr. I say thanks again for being here tonight.

535
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And you will stay and talk about the week in news. Of course, because I have opinions.

536
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Excellent. All right. So let's talk about our gaming week. So we'll move a little quickly tonight because we are.

537
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Because I talk forever. You know what? You know what?

538
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You earned it. All right. Dark soccer. How was your game? What the crap else do I play?

539
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. Because I was actually playing around with modding Mass Effect 2.

540
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I love that that BioWare is like, yeah, go ahead. Mod it all you want. E a patch.

541
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Damn it. So, yeah, I've been playing a lot of a lot more Mass Effect and a little bit more to the moon.

542
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Because that game is absolutely. Just it causes the feels to happen.

543
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It makes the feels happen and they hurt. And then I've been looking at a few other things.

544
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
But honestly, my job right now is going to the gym and looking for a job.

545
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So. Yeah, that's about it. Well, then we'll move on to Loki.

546
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,000
How was your gaming week? Actually, I've been playing a ton of Saints Row the third, ironically enough.

547
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And so I started playing again with my coworker, which probably getting that pretty soon because he's leaving.

548
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:04,000
We've been playing co-op on 360 with the full package and actually haven't really been playing a DLC because it sucks.

549
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
But main game. And so we've been messing around with that a little bit.

550
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And then on PC, I, you know, finally got my car.

551
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Well, I had my copy since that THQ sale on the humble indie bundle, THQ bundle.

552
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And so I've been playing a heavily modded version of the game,

553
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
mainly just so I get the additional cheat that was actually missing from the console version, which was the evil car code.

554
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I love the evil car code from the other games. And I was really sad when it wasn't in Saints Row the third.

555
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But apparently there was a lot of rushing on that game. And so a lot of the features that they would have put in there got cut.

556
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So I've been playing with that and having actually quite a bit of fun with it.

557
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And going through and just trying to get all my achievements and stuff on the Steam version.

558
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And hopefully going to do the same on the console version because I've been trying to finish missions differently.

559
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Because I lost my save that I had. I had an in-game save with almost everything done.

560
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And sure enough, I don't know where it is. So.

561
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You need to save your games in the cloud.

562
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Oh, fuck that. I am not saving shit in the cloud.

563
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:24,000
But clearly gamers want their saves in the cloud because they keep losing them.

564
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
That's what gamers want. We're hearing gamers loud and clear on what they want.

565
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
In the cloud. You know what I used to call the cloud? The internet!

566
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
That's what it is. It's a fucking internet, okay? You're saving it to a server somewhere else, okay?

567
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Why would I want to do that when I can just save it to a memory card that I know where the fuck it is?

568
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Oh, and hey, if the internet's down, guess what? My save still works because it's on a memory card.

569
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And not in the fucking cloud. So, no, I'm fine not saving to the cloud.

570
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Although I do have one cloud save right now. It's my old Minecraft save for Xbox Live Arcade.

571
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I actually agree with you. I turn off all of my cloud storage stuff.

572
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I am thinking about taking it out because I hate having the second option pop up all the time for saves.

573
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I turn it on. It's not hurting anything.

574
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
What I don't like about it is that sometimes it overwrites some of my save files on Mass Effect.

575
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh, well, I can see that.

576
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So, yeah, I've been playing that and then a little Call of Duty. I'm still, you know, playing Call of Duty.

577
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
If that's it, then Seg, how about you? What have you been playing?

578
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
What do you play when you're not designing and all this other stuff?

579
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And moving, because I also moved.

580
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I've been slowly getting back to Team Fortress 2.

581
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I say as I wear my Mann Co. shirt.

582
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And I used to play on 242 Furious, which is just a crazy server.

583
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But Floormaster, I guess, closed it down. I don't know what happened there.

584
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So, I'm trying to find a new permanent home for a server. So, I'm shopping around there.

585
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Any Team Fortress players want to adopt a Seg?

586
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yes, I have. So, it's funny when I play Team Fortress 2, because I have the rarest, most sought-after item that wasn't the gold wrench in TF2.

587
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I have a self-made Max hat, because everyone that was working on Telltale at the time, when we were releasing Season 3 of Sam and Max,

588
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
we all got the self-made Max hat, so it sparkles, because I'm fabulous.

589
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
That was my role on this show.

590
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You've just been out-fabbed.

591
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And it's funny, because I'll play, and then someone will go like,

592
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Dude, there's someone with the self-made. And we're like, dude, why is your hat sparkling?

593
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Or, dude, can I trade for your hat?

594
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yes, random internet stranger. I am going to trade the most rarest hat ever to...

595
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm going to assume they just don't know how rare it is, or something. I don't know.

596
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The ones that asked do. And they're that dumb.

597
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
They actually took out the tradable flag, so I can't even trade if I wanted to.

598
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Because there were other problems that happened. Like, someone's account got hacked for it.

599
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So they just clamped that down.

600
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Over a freaking hat!

601
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I know!

602
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
People like their E-peen.

603
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Why do you think it went free-to-play? It still makes money.

604
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And I don't blame Valve at all for it.

605
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And especially since they're doing it in such a way that's much more open than they could've.

606
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Or that they didn't need to.

607
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I mean, there was a story a few weeks ago that Newell was talking that they had to talk to PayPal.

608
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And say, no, he isn't trading drugs. He actually is getting this from digital hats.

609
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But anyway, so I've been playing TF2.

610
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I've also been going back to Newgrounds and playing all the small little itty-bitty things there.

611
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
There was one in particular I was really attracted to, and I'm actually going to look it up.

612
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It had like a death state, so you either were alive and could do certain things,

613
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
or then you died and you could do other things and then get back to life and all that.

614
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It was a nice little...

615
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
While you find the name of that, some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

616
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
sj100matt says, Segg just said he was fabulous, dropped the mic and walked away.

617
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Yes, he did. He did do that.

618
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Well, I didn't quite walk away. I'm kind of boxed in here in the seats.

619
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
ActDeaf is suggesting one called TF2NewbiesOnly.com.

620
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
But you're not a noob.

621
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Oh, yeah. I know how to point and click.

622
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
All right.

623
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Revive is the name of it.

624
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Which is a really nice little fun game. I do recommend it.

625
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Oh, and Harrison's like, congregate, please.

626
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And I'm like, and please, I've been on Newgrounds.

627
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
You wouldn't have YouTube if it weren't for Newgrounds. I'll go on the record in saying that.

628
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Because Newgrounds started when I was in high school, which was forever ago.

629
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And it's still ticking.

630
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
You better watch it.

631
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
How old are you again? Because I think I'm a little older.

632
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
That's why I'm not saying a number.

633
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's all right.

634
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But anyway, that's been most of my time.

635
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Crawling around Newgrounds and TF2.

636
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, and moving.

637
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Tetris in real life.

638
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, Tetris in real life.

639
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
ActDeaf in our chat room just to clarify a previous comment saying,

640
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
it's called NewbiesOnly to welcome new players, but there are a lot of vets there.

641
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So, to be fair to that server.

642
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Anything else for the gaming week you want to share before we go to me?

643
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh, we'll go to you.

644
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
All right. Honestly, I don't have a lot of new stuff to talk about, so I'll just be real quick.

645
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Continuing to progress in Diablo 3.

646
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I'm officially way further than I was before.

647
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I'm in Act 3 now, which before the furthest I got was the beginning of Act 2.

648
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
So, yeah, I guess I'm kind of enjoying it this time.

649
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I can't even explain it. Don't ask me why.

650
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I think because I'm taking it at my own pace.

651
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I'm actually exploring the auction house stuff a little bit.

652
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Not the money auction house, but the gold one.

653
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Trying to figure out the ins and outs on how to make money there.

654
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And that's kind of a fascinating little meta game in and of itself.

655
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But the real money auction house, forget it.

656
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I mean, all that stuff is the real high-end stuff.

657
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Otherwise, been playing Warcraft.

658
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Yes, more Mass Effect, but playing a lot of the multiplayer this week.

659
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I don't know. There was just kind of like a...

660
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
One night, we even did some streaming this week, didn't we, Darkseid?

661
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Yeah, that was really...

662
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Shane?

663
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That was when my character was twitching and spasming on your screen.

664
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah, we were just laughing and having a good time.

665
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
We need to do more game streaming. That was actually fun.

666
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And of course, more Tomb Raider.

667
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm still getting closer to the end on that one.

668
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And then you're going to lend it to me.

669
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Sure, I guess, if you'll actually play it. Absolutely.

670
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I tried playing Mass Effect, but now I bought it on PC.

671
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
That is true.

672
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
That is true.

673
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So maybe we'll finally get Jamie to talk about another game.

674
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
If for no other reason, I will loan her Tomb Raider for that fact.

675
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
You know what, though? I love To the Moon.

676
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Oh, yeah.

677
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Have you played it?

678
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yes, you need to play To the Moon.

679
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You need to play To the Moon.

680
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I have not played To the Moon.

681
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You need to play To the Moon.

682
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I will. Yes, yes, sir.

683
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Internet, you need to play To the Moon.

684
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I'm probably where he's about middle-aged now.

685
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I've just been sort of slowly going through it, but...

686
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Have tissues.

687
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I know. I already sobbed a little bit, because...

688
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Oh.

689
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But I found my favorite line.

690
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Oh, you don't know.

691
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I found my favorite line in the game.

692
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It was like, that's a problem with you neurotypicals always telling us what to do.

693
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
That was my favorite line in the game so far.

694
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I did play Civ V because I had to try it.

695
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Somebody has built a custom mod that allows you to play as certain Mass Effect civilizations.

696
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And my fandom...

697
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I want to be a Krogan.

698
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I don't know if they have those yet.

699
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
They have Asari and they have Volus.

700
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It's kind of fun.

701
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
All right.

702
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So I could talk like this the entire time.

703
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yes.

704
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
All right.

705
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
There we go.

706
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
That's that for now.

707
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
That's my gaming week.

708
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Let's move on.

709
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
That's the best hat ever.

710
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

711
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
use the passphrase RING.

712
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Housekeeping tonight.

713
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us on Twitter or of course on Facebook.

714
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

715
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
We're also on Google Plus.

716
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
We do have a great FOOGLE Question of the Week coming up later in the show,

717
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
so make sure you've answered it if you haven't already.

718
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
And I should plug that we are three weeks away from episode 500.

719
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Still don't know how we're going to celebrate it, but we'll think of something.

720
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
That's going to be in April, won't it?

721
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It will be in April.

722
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It's going to be right before your birthday.

723
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It will be.

724
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Ooh, we should definitely have cake.

725
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah.

726
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Jamie's like, throw me a party.

727
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Yay.

728
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
It's my present.

729
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Episode 500.

730
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And I quit.

731
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I quit.

732
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
No.

733
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So see if somebody quits on episode 500.

734
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
That alone is worth tuning in for.

735
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
No, but I should have a diva breakdown.

736
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's about time for me to have one.

737
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah, I'm like, I've had at least two of those, so.

738
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.

739
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
What's going on in the gaming industry this week,

740
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
now that we're only an hour into the show?

741
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Loki.

742
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Oh, I should have talked more.

743
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Yes.

744
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
There is a brand new Pokémon game coming out in Japan,

745
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
and I'm assuming over here at some point.

746
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It'll probably be a console release, like a physical release,

747
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
when it comes out over here.

748
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
But Pokémon Rumble You.

749
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's...

750
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
No, Rumble Me.

751
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm sorry, but the system is the Wii U, not the Wii Me.

752
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Because Wii Me would be really weird.

753
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
That's what I call my cat.

754
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
If you want Pokémon to Rumble You,

755
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
you have issues of fandom beyond anything that Dark Sakura has for Garris,

756
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I'm just saying.

757
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
You can make them Rumble You if you want,

758
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
because they do sell some individual figures that go along with this game.

759
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
That's right, it's going to be using the near-field communication technology

760
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
of the Wii U to hoard this game like Skylanders.

761
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
The inevitable has happened.

762
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
They have said,

763
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Hey, guess what?

764
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
There's a game that involves collectible figures,

765
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and they're making money off these figures like crazy.

766
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Well, I like money.

767
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
We like money.

768
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Nintendo needs more money, so that's what they're doing.

769
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
They're launching with seven figures.

770
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Of course, one of those figures being Pikachu.

771
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
They're reasonably priced, I guess.

772
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I guess 1,800 yen, or...

773
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
1,800 yen is the actual price of the game.

774
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
19 bucks, 20 bucks, whatever.

775
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And the figures themselves are around 2 bucks, or 200 yen.

776
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
So 2 bucks each.

777
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
However, if you look at those figures, you're like,

778
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Yeah, that's way too much for a figure.

779
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
They're like the Burger King figures, aren't they?

780
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Yeah, they're like shit that you get out of a fucking quarter machine,

781
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
in the little bubbles, okay?

782
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
But they're Pokémon!

783
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Oh, well in that case, let's charge the Pokémon Premium!

784
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It prints money.

785
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It's evolved into more money!

786
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
No, but they're gonna be doing this.

787
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And my guess is this would probably launch over here in the fourth quarter,

788
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
just in time for the whole collectible figure game fad

789
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
to hit its Guitar Hero meltdown phase.

790
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I am really curious how retail stores are gonna react to this,

791
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
because there's gonna be a point.

792
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You know, there's already, like at the Target, or Toys R Us,

793
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
there's already like a Skylanders Isle.

794
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
So now, it's gonna...

795
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
There's gonna be Disney Infinity, there's gonna be Pokémon,

796
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
like there's gonna come a point where the retailers are gonna say,

797
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Enough! No more.

798
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Or it's now a competition to see which one of these we're gonna carry.

799
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Or, here's a thought, and totally on speculation train.

800
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You're seeing all these more physical item things,

801
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
so that sort of a bait and switch of going more digital for most things,

802
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and then just having enough more retail presence things,

803
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
things that are justifiable beyond bits.

804
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Hmm, interesting.

805
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Just a thought.

806
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Interesting.

807
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
A possible replacement for the Software Isle in the future.

808
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Yeah.

809
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh my gosh.

810
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Here's my thing.

811
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Is all the Pokémon that are included in this little pack or whatever,

812
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
or the figures that they have available, they all look the same.

813
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I mean, I'm serious.

814
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I don't know shit about Pokémon, and I'm not about to pretend that I do,

815
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
but all of these Pokémon in the screenshot look exactly the same,

816
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
except for color palette swaps or something like that.

817
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I mean, it's just, they all look the same.

818
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I just thought of a fun game for a future episode of OLR,

819
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
is that we'll show Loki pictures of various Pokémon,

820
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
and say, What do you think this one's called?

821
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It's fine, because I don't know.

822
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
As long as it's multiple choice.

823
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm pretty good at guessing.

824
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
No, but seriously, I...

825
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm not going to say that they're not going to make money from this,

826
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
because there's people like Shane,

827
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
that will buy anything that has to do with Pokémon,

828
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
so I'm not surprised.

829
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And he will get other people to buy it too.

830
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I'm sure he's super excited to hear that Pokémon Pikachu system

831
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
is coming out over here.

832
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
He's probably going to pick that up.

833
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
He was trying to convince me I needed one.

834
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
He's your pusher, man.

835
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I'm telling you.

836
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
So, yeah.

837
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
They're going to try.

838
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
My thing is, I don't know if it's going to be successful.

839
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And the fact that, you know...
