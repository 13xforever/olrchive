[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

00:00:54,332 --> 00:00:55,053
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

4
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:18,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Who claims it has not worked.

5
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:18,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, it has not worked.

6
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:19,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It has not worked.

7
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you've been... How long have you and Nellie been together since the start of OLR, right?

8
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:27,752
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys were together.

9
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:28,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, around there.

10
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:29,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, so... I think 2001.

11
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:31,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And you and Dan have been together that long, too.

12
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:34,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've been together for 15 years.

13
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:35,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my gosh.

14
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:37,078
[SPEAKER_02]: As of the 23rd of January.

15
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:41,787
[SPEAKER_04]: This show just, you know, fosters long-term relationships.

16
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:48,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, over the course of the show, I think I've had four or five different... I did get married after we started the show.

17
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:52,175
[SPEAKER_04]: But the one I'm on is the last one, because he's listening.

18
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:55,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know he's a keeper, because he's supportive and all that stuff.

19
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:56,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

20
00:01:57,139 --> 00:02:05,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and he's officially my hero for re-reblogging one of my posts on my Mass Effect blog, because I totally agree with him.

21
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:09,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you guys and your Mass Effect lulzy stuff.

22
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what?

23
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,822
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking about Shitadel earlier.

24
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:18,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we already dogging the DLC before anybody's played it?

25
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:20,627
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my special nickname for the Citadel.

26
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:21,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

27
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:22,067
[SPEAKER_04]: The Shitadel?

28
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:22,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very clever.

29
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:23,828
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very creative.

30
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Becky and I call it that sometimes.

31
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:26,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny you.

32
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf Ken Allen

33
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a confession, Rob I really didn't play many of them

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,351
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,265
[SPEAKER_02]: and I did like Phantasmagoria, but I played the LucasArts games.

36
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:27,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Loom.

37
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:29,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well that was all kind of around that same time.

38
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:34,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was around that same time, but I just wasn't as into it myself.

39
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:35,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, I loved it.

40
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:35,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a console girl.

41
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:42,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I will admit, I was not as into Space Quest as I was into Heroes Quest, and especially King's Quest.

42
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:45,721
[SPEAKER_04]: That series was so amazing to me.

43
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:51,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody remembers King's Quest IV, Rosella, because that's the one that incorporates all the old fairy tales and stuff.

44
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, great, great classic game.

45
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:54,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't get into them.

46
00:03:54,708 --> 00:04:01,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only real thing I played on a PC before that were the text-based gemstones.

47
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course your favorite, Civilization, the old school one.

48
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:07,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I got into that early on.

49
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:08,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I was never into Civ.

50
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:11,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I should give a plug for this.

51
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious what you guys think about this.

52
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:18,537
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Microsoft is doing a huge sale on their games on demand right now where you can get a lot of these...

53
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:20,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

54
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:35,552
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

55
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,047
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was going to try and get Jamie into Civ, I would be all like, poke, poke, here's a $10 gift card.

56
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:02,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Poke, poke, here's what you go spend it on.

57
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:02,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Poke, poke.

58
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,811
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know that won't work, so I'm not even going to bother.

59
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:06,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not giving her money.

60
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,217
[SPEAKER_02]: If you gave me money right now, I'd probably just pay bills with it.

61
00:05:12,558 --> 00:05:19,965
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think about Microsoft responding to this really deep cut sale thing of sorts?

62
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:27,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think they're just trying to push digital sales, trying to figure out, you know, how to get people interested in that stuff.

63
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:31,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all about getting them more exposure.

64
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:46,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, you know, kind of trying to, I don't know, hype up stuff and, you know, as we approach a supposed announcement of some sort, you know, so maybe...

65
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it seems to have worked for Steam and stuff to help drive sales.

66
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's why they want to... Hey guys, you know we do sell games digitally as well, right?

67
00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:59,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just Sony and Steam.

68
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:00,959
[SPEAKER_03]: We do that as well.

69
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hey, buy something.

70
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:07,705
[SPEAKER_04]: A tiny correction to what I had stated earlier.

71
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:11,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby says it was Space Quest 4 was the one in the series that Ken Allen did.

72
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:11,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Not 2.

73
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:13,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, my bad.

74
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:21,596
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say that I know this one for a fact because Bobby and I are both fond over this one and our mutual love of an old-ass Sierra game I bet none of you have heard of.

75
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:22,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Jones in the Fast Lane.

76
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:24,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

77
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

78
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know something, Rob.

79
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:09,752
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

80
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:14,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Why people on Tumblr think that I want to see animated gifs of Caden's butt.

81
00:07:15,797 --> 00:07:18,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're following those Tumblrs.

82
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:20,801
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about what you want to follow on the Tumbles.

83
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there one called Caden's ass?

84
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,864
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's called Shepard's butt.

85
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it's like, hey, we saw that you viewed alien penises.

86
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,429
[SPEAKER_03]: You may like Caden's butt.

87
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,752
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also one that's called Shepard's left boob.

88
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:36,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

89
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:07,138
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

90
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:09,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf, yet again trying to correct me here.

91
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:14,083
[SPEAKER_04]: The only difference between the disc and CD version was the CD version had full spoken audio.

92
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:15,984
[SPEAKER_04]: The animated characters were still there.

93
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:20,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought in the CD version, they were actual like digitized characters.

94
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the disc one, they were cartoons.

95
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,431
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the disc version, there is a fuck yes, I boob tumbler.

96
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:28,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the disc version, it came on like 48 discs, right?

97
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, that's the equivalent of a CD.

98
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:34,076
[SPEAKER_04]: The disc version of Jones, I think, was only like four.

99
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:35,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Like four discs or so.

100
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,219
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I remember, what was it?

101
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Willy Beamish, I think it was.

102
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a game I was playing way back in the day.

103
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:41,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that game.

104
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:43,803
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on like 12 discs.

105
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I had an anime fighting game.

106
00:08:47,385 --> 00:08:47,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called...

107
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:50,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what it was called.

108
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:51,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Something lace.

109
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what it was called now.

110
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,463
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like metal and lace or something like that.

111
00:08:55,864 --> 00:09:00,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I got into like software, et cetera, you know, back in the day.

112
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:06,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Never did get that game to run correctly, but damn, it took a long time with like eight plus disks installing.

113
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:11,618
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the whole reason you needed a hard drive was because you had to have something to install the stinking disks to.

114
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:14,240
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the 14 disk descent.

115
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, yeah.

116
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,604
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you had to have like a rubber band to bind all the discs together.

117
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:20,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

118
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:21,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have it somewhere.

119
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:23,808
[SPEAKER_02]: My stack of Descent discs.

120
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:25,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Classic Gaming.

121
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:26,327
[SPEAKER_04]: What a trip.

122
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:31,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into what we've been playing this week as far as modern games go.

123
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that classics are bad by any means.

124
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:35,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've been playing Capcom Arcade a lot lately.

125
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we just start with Rob?

126
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:41,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I was going to say... No, that was last week, not this week.

127
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:44,393
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was going to say, you missed last week, and I was talking about Capcom Arcade.

128
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:51,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know that the freebie game that you can just get for free on PlayStation 3 is Black Tiger, which you've talked about on the show before?

129
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:51,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

130
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:54,168
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can flip between the Japanese and the English versions.

131
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:56,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so excited to tell you last week and then you weren't here.

132
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:59,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Dan might have already gotten it.

133
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:00,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

134
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:00,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.

135
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a neat game.

136
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of Dan's favorites.

137
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:05,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week they're putting out Gun.Smoke.

138
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:07,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Gun.Smoke.

139
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Gun.Smoke.

140
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:08,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

141
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:10,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a demo for Gun.Smoke.

142
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:11,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good times.

143
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:12,804
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll start with you.

144
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:13,925
[SPEAKER_04]: What were you going to say?

145
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:14,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Something sassy over there, Loki?

146
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:22,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder, you know, because now that they're allowing you to get all these weird URL names, I wonder if someday we will have Gun.Smoke.

147
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:23,293
Yeah.

148
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,674
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

149
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:54,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect, The Reckoning DLC, The Last Multiplayer DLC, The

150
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,960
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

151
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,587
[SPEAKER_04]: But the multiplayer is so good.

152
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:33,709
[SPEAKER_04]: The multiplayer is fantastic.

153
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:37,453
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys wonder why we don't shut up about Mass Effect 3 ever, ever.

154
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:41,717
[SPEAKER_04]: For DarkSakura, it's a lot of this fandom and all this stuff she keeps perpetuating.

155
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:42,758
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's the multiplayer.

156
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:46,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I can keep going back and playing that and it's so much fun.

157
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:47,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing a lot of multiplayer.

158
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:49,785
[SPEAKER_02]: The bulk of my playing has been multiplayer because I...

159
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:53,327
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

160
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:14,823
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good of Bioware, by the way, to give everybody a free character new.

161
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking back, I wish they'd done that for each piece of DLC they did.

162
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:29,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand their whole little microtransaction model is to make people save up the in-game credits or be tempted to spend three bucks on a pack to maybe get a character.

163
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:32,841
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it was a good gesture to give everybody a freebie.

164
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:33,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Hawkeye.

165
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I have one of him too, the Zayid wannabe.

166
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:02,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, but like with the bow and arrow, it's weird.

167
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:03,737
[SPEAKER_02]: The omni-bow.

168
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:10,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I love engineers, but I wasn't, like it was cool for a little bit, but I went back to my human because I don't have a quarian engineer on PC.

169
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:18,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I finally, though, like, this is the first time I've actually gotten a character up to 20 and promoted my class.

170
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:28,307
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I have to start over, and I, like, I hate the starting over, because, like, they put us on a collector map right when I just started over, and we all know the collectors are bullshit.

171
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:28,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

172
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:34,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the second one, thankfully, was a Cerberus thing, but...

173
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:36,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fun.

174
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:47,418
[SPEAKER_02]: The first game I was in, though, I had to roll my eyes because we had a Collector Adept, we had a Gath Juggernaut, and we had a Krogan Warlord.

175
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was almost all of the new classes.

176
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was amazed.

177
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a balanced party.

178
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:58,322
[SPEAKER_02]: We just flew through everything like it was no big deal.

179
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:01,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a hot knife through butter.

180
00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:02,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

181
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:09,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says he's kind of done with the Mass Effect universe for now.

182
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for you.

183
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, but I get it.

184
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:13,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is it time?

185
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is the last multiplayer DLC.

186
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:18,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the last single player DLC next week.

187
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:18,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it time?

188
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, nothing good lasts forever, right?

189
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it time to move on to whatever's next for the Mass Effect series?

190
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:23,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Three words.

191
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:25,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy VII.

192
00:14:27,472 --> 00:14:27,652
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

193
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:28,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Still going on.

194
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:29,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Still going.

195
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:32,013
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a while.

196
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:33,334
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a while, though, to come back.

197
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:35,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was all the movies and everything.

198
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:35,854
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

199
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:37,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share or should I move on to Loki?

200
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:40,616
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really all I played.

201
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:41,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably going to be canceling a while.

202
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad face.

203
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for a little while until I get a job.

204
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:46,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

205
00:14:46,897 --> 00:14:47,237
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

206
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:48,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

207
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:50,918
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week was all right.

208
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:52,459
[SPEAKER_03]: It started off okay, at least.

209
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I started, we were playing Borderlands 2 and kind of going through that stuff.

210
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:04,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that wonderful add-on content pack came out from 2K.

211
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:05,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, okay, cool.

212
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:07,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and get this.

213
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:16,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know I could have saved some money by buying the DLC, either the season pass or buying just the DLC straight from the marketplace.

214
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:21,370
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing, though, is that I want to put it on more than one system.

215
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I play with a friend, and I don't want to play DLC twice.

216
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:27,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And the add-on content packs do not have DRM on them.

217
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,453
[SPEAKER_03]: They also apparently don't work very well.

218
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:34,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the true nature of Gearbox is finally coming out.

219
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:35,556
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, huh...

220
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:37,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Borderlands is such an awesome game.

221
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:41,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did they really fuck up Duke Nukem Forever and Aliens Colonial Marines?

222
00:15:41,998 --> 00:15:43,178
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it's a fluke.

223
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:46,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they fuck up everything, apparently.

224
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:49,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Borderlands is just, I guess, some weird fluke for this company.

225
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:55,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they took some of that Duke Nukem money and Aliens Colonial Marines money and made the game better or something.

226
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:58,943
[SPEAKER_03]: But the disc broke the game.

227
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:02,104
[SPEAKER_03]: The disc broke the DLC.

228
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:05,305
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, I couldn't get any of the DLC to work on either system.

229
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:12,408
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that did get it to work, they're having problems with the DLC not quite working because they can't pick up any of the weapons that are exclusive to the game.

230
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:17,230
[SPEAKER_03]: You get in there saying, this weapon is for this piece of DLC which you don't have.

231
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:22,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of sucks for everyone else.

232
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:28,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, we could probably just remove the DLC and probably have to, I don't know, clear our cache or something, re-download something, I don't know.

233
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:30,246
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's still annoying, though.

234
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:34,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to have to go through this process and try to figure out, okay, which series of events do I have to do to get this to work?

235
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,710
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, so I was trying to get this thing to work, and...

236
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:44,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadow Next Gen has an opinion on Gearbox.

237
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:47,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadow Next Gen says, Gearbox cannot be blamed for Duke Nukem.

238
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,761
[SPEAKER_04]: All they did was they put their existing material and made it playable.

239
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:53,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Gearbox is totally to blame, though, for aliens.

240
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:54,703
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's fine.

241
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:55,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Meeting you halfway.

242
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:57,124
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

243
00:16:57,144 --> 00:16:57,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll accept that.

244
00:16:58,124 --> 00:17:27,244
[SPEAKER_03]: but the thing is so okay so it's all fucked up in one way or another and for me it's a little bit more fucked up than some of the people that have the game and just like can't either access certain DLC or can't access the guns in certain DLC or you know the waypoint's not showing up and their solution is well we're just gonna have to put out a patch for it the disc is for people that don't have fucking online how are you gonna download this patch to make the fucking offline thing work correctly oh that makes total sense

245
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:30,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys test this at all?

246
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:33,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean you have to do one of those weird things where you download it to a USB stick?

247
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,100
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there is no way.

248
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,101
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that for system updates.

249
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:39,943
[SPEAKER_03]: The console firmware, you can't do that for game updates.

250
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,366
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do that legitimately.

251
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:46,528
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get tools to do that.

252
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:52,232
[SPEAKER_04]: You're telling me that the technology's there, it's just that for whatever reason they don't let the publishers use it.

253
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:53,193
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

254
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:24,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So for now we've been playing like emulator stuff because I have these modded Xboxes that we were messing around with and so we've been playing like Super Nintendo and Nintendo games and stuff.

255
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:37,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I also started trying Far Cry 2 because my thought is, hey, you know, I remember Far Cry Instinct's Predator had a pretty awesome map editor and you can make your own levels and stuff like that and the game's not that bad.

256
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:38,951
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

257
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would have probably picked three first, but two seems to be pretty good price point-wise.

258
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:09,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm recreating my favorite maps from other games in the Far Cry map editor.

259
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:16,922
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got, I've started from Grand Theft Auto IV, Bellative, Gay Tony.

260
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:23,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the Ziggurat map, which is the ferry terminal that's under construction.

261
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:25,025
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've started that, and it looks pretty awesome.

262
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:36,309
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully I'm going to just take all my favorite levels or I'll just download some if I'm too damn lazy because it is quite a process to get that stuff looking right and actually getting it to work correctly.

263
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:50,034
[SPEAKER_03]: So I may just download some other maps and stuff like that and hopefully maybe we can switch over that because I think right now we bought another map pack for Call of Duty a couple weeks ago and we're kind of already sick of them.

264
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:50,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...

265
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:52,094
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

266
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:15,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Dicks like, hey, I got to see Grand Theft Auto V being played twice because the guy died midway through one of the missions.

267
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got to see it all over again.

268
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:19,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I fucking hate you.

269
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,822
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, it sounds really awesome though.

270
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:24,666
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just talking about how you can switch between the three characters during the game.

271
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:28,788
[SPEAKER_03]: They showed off one of the levels that... I don't think it was in the trailer.

272
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a screenshot.

273
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:33,550
[SPEAKER_03]: It was basically where the guy's rappelling down the side of an office building.

274
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:40,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's like, oh yeah, so one of the guys you're controlling is flying a helicopter and another one's a sharpshooter on one of the other buildings.

275
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:42,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other guy's the one that's rappelling.

276
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:47,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually as you're rappelling, the detail in the game, you have people coming in the offices and going, hey, what's going on?

277
00:20:48,318 --> 00:20:48,738
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?

278
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:49,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just...

279
00:20:50,259 --> 00:21:10,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it sounds really awesome and of course he reiterated the size of the game and stuff and he just says it looks fucking amazing so I can't wait so fuck the next gen, I don't care, I just want this game that's right but what about those games analysts that say oh for sure Grand Theft Auto 5 will come to next gen consoles

280
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, here's what he said.

281
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,217
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll come to next-gen consoles eventually.

282
00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:18,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only way I believe that is if they do a PC port, which they're not doing right away.

283
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:22,906
[SPEAKER_03]: They may do one later on, or they may go the Red Dead Redemption route and say, fuck it, we're not going to do one.

284
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:34,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if they're worried that the game's going to get hacked, because that's where you get your fucking keys for... Well, they're stupid enough anyways to put the fucking keys for Grand Theft Auto and have it be all the same across platforms.

285
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:35,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why they do that.

286
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:39,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's assume that they don't do that.

287
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they do put out a PC port, it would enable hacking.

288
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:44,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least that's how it's been.

289
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:48,712
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that, yeah, they could do a PC port.

290
00:21:48,732 --> 00:21:55,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they do that, then they'll probably do a next-gen port because they're going to be up-resing everything or making it run better, have better particle effects and that kind of stuff.

291
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:25,571
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not going to be at launch and it would be like eventually like maybe next year or a year after that depending on what their release schedule is as far as what Rockstar is going to be working on next probably DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5 which would be pretty awesome so I don't know they're going to be busy for a while so I don't think they can really split the resources I am kind of surprised that it's not on the Wii U but I don't know whatever

292
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:53,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see ShadowNextGen in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com He wouldn't take Loki and then was bragging about getting to see Grand Theft Auto 5 That ain't right Well, it's just, you know, they took our buyer and stuff and, you know, our Well, he was the vice president of sales, now he's some new business guy So it's just all the management people and the buyer Don't worry, I'm working on getting rid of the buyer

293
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:55,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon enough, I'll be going.

294
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:57,366
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll just be a matter of time.

295
00:22:57,386 --> 00:23:02,957
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did say, I'm like, so, you're taking me along with, you know, DPS, because they're going to have Grand Theft Auto there.

296
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:04,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we don't need to send this VP guy.

297
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:05,843
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't know anything about games.

298
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

299
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:11,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Minecraft.

300
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:12,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Played a little bit more Minecraft.

301
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:13,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

302
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:13,797
[SPEAKER_03]: How's the server going?

303
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It's empty.

304
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:18,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some last week.

305
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,060
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very empty.

306
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I hardly see a soul on there.

307
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I do check the logs every now and then to see if people are actually connecting.

308
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:29,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to thank whoever built the ginormous N7 in front of my house.

309
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:30,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that wasn't you?

310
00:23:30,746 --> 00:23:32,006
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't me!

311
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:35,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I do keep an eye on it every now and then.

312
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:41,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I read the forums and I also check my 3D map every once in a while to see if something is new.

313
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, hey, that's different.

314
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,672
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was working on... I don't even know what it is now.

315
00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:52,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to create this little airship thing that I have a picture of.

316
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:55,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily create it exactly, but just something similar.

317
00:23:56,274 --> 00:23:59,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like, okay, I'm going to make this giant castle inside this mountain.

318
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I'm wasting so much damn time in Minecraft.

319
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:07,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be doing something more productive, but I just didn't want to be productive that day.

320
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:09,583
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to build Hogwarts.

321
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:12,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I remember what it was now, why I was playing Minecraft.

322
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:18,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my wife was watching Hulu, which is being streamed through my Xbox, and I wanted to build maps in Far Cry.

323
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:22,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was waiting for Far Cry to download or something like that.

324
00:24:22,972 --> 00:24:24,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I bought it on PC as well, so...

325
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:29,803
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of buying stuff on the sale on Xbox I bought PC games.

326
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:32,584
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt says I'll be getting Minecraft soon.

327
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:41,927
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I saw at Target those little like it's mixed in with all the cards for the crap online stuff you're never going to play like Club Penguin and all those you know how like they sell tons of those cards.

328
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:43,508
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a card for Minecraft.

329
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:43,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

330
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:46,509
[SPEAKER_04]: So like you can buy Minecraft at like Target and stuff now.

331
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:51,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I am eventually at some point once I get motivated enough to finish the website and stuff to

332
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:53,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Settling up nights to do things.

333
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't quite done that yet.

334
00:24:55,756 --> 00:25:01,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Codeman's going in there and he's doing videos of some of the Mob Arena stuff.

335
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:05,687
[SPEAKER_03]: That needs to be fixed and balanced.

336
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:06,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

337
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:29,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually just been having fun digging my holes, which is pretty much all my houses are.

338
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:29,971
[SPEAKER_02]: They're holes in the ground.

339
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:30,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you do on the show.

340
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:32,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Just dig your own holes all night.

341
00:25:33,254 --> 00:25:35,876
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen my house, haven't you?

342
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:36,677
[SPEAKER_02]: My prairie dog?

343
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:37,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, your Minecraft house?

344
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:37,857
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't.

345
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:38,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Minecraft house.

346
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:38,678
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

347
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:41,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a series of underground tunnels.

348
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:43,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been on Minecraft in like a month.

349
00:25:43,302 --> 00:25:43,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame on me.

350
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:44,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I get yelled at all the time.

351
00:25:45,464 --> 00:25:46,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Yelled at over it.

352
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:47,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

353
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:49,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I keep looking at your half-finished house all the time.

354
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:50,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I need to finish it.

355
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:52,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anything else you want to share for Gaming Week?

356
00:25:52,756 --> 00:25:53,056
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

357
00:25:53,157 --> 00:25:55,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait until you hear what I have been playing and you're going to be like, God damn it, Rob.

358
00:25:56,017 --> 00:25:57,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so my Gaming Week.

359
00:25:57,438 --> 00:26:07,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was driving around town hoping somebody broke street on Tomb Raider, because I heard a lot of places were selling Tomb Raider early, but I couldn't find any, so I guess I'll have to wait like everybody else.

360
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo.

361
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,141
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you not want Tomb Raider after the Conan review?

362
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:25,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, Conan, I love his review thing, it's kind of hit and miss and stuff, but my god are the deaths in that so violent and frequent.

363
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:29,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of, I think Jamie would like the game actually for that reason.

364
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:30,015
[SPEAKER_02]: What game?

365
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:30,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomb Raider.

366
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:31,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the new one?

367
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:42,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because there's stuff, you know, okay, you gotta go left, oh, you gotta go right, oh, you didn't go right fast enough, and now she impales her neck on a stick very violently.

368
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:43,482
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds awesome.

369
00:26:44,222 --> 00:26:47,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wasn't... One of our listeners got me the last one, the Guardian of Light.

370
00:26:47,663 --> 00:26:47,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah?

371
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:48,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you.

372
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:51,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't... Well, Guardian of Light is so different, though.

373
00:26:51,365 --> 00:26:52,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Guardian of Light, though.

374
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:52,865
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a great game.

375
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:55,386
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, I wasn't really prepared.

376
00:26:55,486 --> 00:27:01,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I should have known better because, like, you know, I know Tomb Raider was all about the death scenes back in the day, but it was a little more cartoony back then.

377
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:04,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Locking the butler in the fridge.

378
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:14,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of that stuff now, like, when I saw that whole, like, impale scene, I was like, oh, maybe, maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm having second thoughts about this purchase because, you know, I'm not huge on the violence, but...

379
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll deal with it.

380
00:27:16,614 --> 00:27:18,655
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I hear, it's limited.

381
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:20,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if you can still make her break her own neck.

382
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:21,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, probably.

383
00:27:21,776 --> 00:27:22,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure you can.

384
00:27:23,356 --> 00:27:24,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't be Tomb Raider if you couldn't.

385
00:27:24,257 --> 00:27:25,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's fun.

386
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:27,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still want to lock the butler in the freezer.

387
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:28,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was the only thing I ever did in 2.

388
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:29,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can.

389
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:31,759
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't surprise me if they have throwbacks to...

390
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:34,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then again, her mansion's not really in this one, huh?

391
00:27:34,461 --> 00:27:35,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's a reboot.

392
00:27:35,802 --> 00:27:36,543
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a prequel.

393
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:38,044
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't have a butler yet.

394
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:39,245
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to hope for a new one.

395
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:43,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe at the end of the game when she gets to her mansion or something like that.

396
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:45,710
[SPEAKER_02]: She gets a letter from her butler.

397
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:47,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear ma'am, I'm still in the freezer.

398
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:48,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Please let me out.

399
00:27:49,454 --> 00:27:50,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Sincerely, your butler.

400
00:27:51,688 --> 00:27:52,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, that is gross.

401
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:53,129
[SPEAKER_04]: You paid $60 for this, Rob.

402
00:28:11,184 --> 00:28:12,685
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be trying to rape her.

403
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:14,725
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be saving your money, Rob.

404
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:16,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a 401k.

405
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,867
[SPEAKER_02]: SSG 100 Matt said the best.

406
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:21,408
[SPEAKER_02]: You should reread that in your mom's voice.

407
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, that's gross, Rob.

408
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:23,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Through her neck.

409
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:24,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Rob.

410
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:26,210
[SPEAKER_04]: That would totally be her.

411
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,590
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

412
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,171
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about what I... I adore your mom.

413
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:30,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

414
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,860
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I smoking?

415
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

416
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:55,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the fact that I've been into Path of Exile lately made me go like, maybe I should go back and try Diablo 3 because I was enjoying Path of Exile.

417
00:28:56,462 --> 00:29:02,623
[SPEAKER_04]: People say Diablo 3 is... Extrofer was like, you need to go back because a lot of it's patches and all this.

418
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:04,724
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've actually been enjoying it.

419
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:09,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to admit, I think part of that is the fact that nobody else is playing Diablo 3 right now.

420
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:12,345
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get people jumping in on your game?

421
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:13,746
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

422
00:29:37,485 --> 00:30:05,301
[SPEAKER_04]: and I said you know what I'm going to play this through one time just me at my own pace because I think part of what broke the game for me was that having people jump in your game as much as it's nice to be social and all that like it paces the game a lot differently because people will be off kind of doing their own thing you got to go back to town and sell stuff but you don't want to miss some of the exploration and the XP and you know I don't know like so I kind of want to just I want to play this game by myself for a little bit one time but always connected to the internet

423
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:16,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but it's always connected to the internet, which is ridiculous in its own right, but hey, at least I got the game complimentary with the whole Warcraft Pass thing, so I can't complain too much about that.

424
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:18,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have to reinstall it and give it another go.

425
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:26,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't dislike it, I just didn't like not being able to rotate the camera and getting a better view, so that was really my biggest pet peeve.

426
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:30,245
[SPEAKER_02]: That and people jumping in my game, which I had turned it off and people were still jumping in my game.
