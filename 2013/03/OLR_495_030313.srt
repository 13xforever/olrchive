Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, March 3, 2013, two companies promise new games at PAX East.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Gran Turismo 6 will be out before year's end.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And could Shenmue 3 happen via Kickstarter?

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 495 for this March the 3rd of 2013.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're here to talk about video games and gaming and gaming culture with my co-host.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Over here is DarkSakura.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hi.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How are you, DarkSakura? Welcome back tonight.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Thank you.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're welcome. Hope you're feeling better.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
As you said before the show, because you were looking at the show and you said,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
495, why have we been doing this for 495 weeks?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And I said, chicks. To get chicks.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It hasn't worked.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I did have chicken the other day.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello over there, tech master Loki, who claims it has not worked.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Nah, it hasn't worked.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It has not worked.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, you've been, how long have you and Nelly been together since the start of OLR, right?

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You guys were together around there.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, around there.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Wow, so.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think 2001.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And you and Dan have been together that long too.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, we've been together for 15 years.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh my gosh.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
As of the 23rd of January.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This show just, you know, fosters long-term relationships.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Meanwhile, over the course of the show, I think I've had four or five different.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I did get married after we started the show.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But the one I'm on is the last one.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Cause he's listening.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So you know he's a keeper.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Cause he's, you know, supportive and all that stuff.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Right?

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, and he's officially my hero for re-reblogging one of my posts on my Mass Effect blog.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Cause I totally agree with him.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, you guys and your Mass Effect lolsy stuff.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hey, you know what?

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Huh?

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You were talking about Shitadel earlier.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Are we already dogging the DLC before anybody's played it?

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, that's just my special nickname for the Citadel.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, okay.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The Shitadel?

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's very clever.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's very creative.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, Becky and I call it that sometimes.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Funny you.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was going to do a kickoff topic for the start of the show tonight.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I didn't really have a lot going on.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I thought I would give a cheap plug to Bobby.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He's always up before us.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right before Bobby Black Wolf.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And on his show tonight, a really cool interview with Ken Allen.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You may not recognize that name, but I'm sure you recognize his work.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Especially if you're like a 30-something or a late 20-something.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You probably played Sierra Adventure games back in the day.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah, he was a composer for Space Quest, the old Space Quest games.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have a confession, Rob.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What's that?

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I really didn't play many of them.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, what's up with that?

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What were you playing in the early 90s?

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Were you strictly console?

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I was strictly console, except for my addiction to Doom.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
When I hit my last year of high school and beginning of college, I was really into Doom and Descent.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Interesting.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And I did like Phantasmagoria, but I played the LucasArts games.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I played Loom.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, well that was all kind of around that same time.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah, it was around that same time, but I just wasn't as into it myself.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh God, I love to be-

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I was a console girl.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I will admit, I was not as into Space Quest as I was in the Hero's Quest, and especially King's Quest.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That series was so amazing to me.

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think everybody remembers King's Quest IV, Rosella, because that's the one that incorporates all the old fairy tales and stuff.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh my gosh, great, great classic game.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I just didn't get into them.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I think the only real thing I played on a PC before that were the text-based, like Gemstone.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And then of course your favorite, Civilization, the old school one.

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I got into that early on.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I was never into Civ.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I should give a plug for this. I'm curious what you guys think about this.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Microsoft is doing a huge sale on their Games on Demand right now, where you can get a lot of these, not really a lot of new stuff.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think there were some things in there like Borderlands 2 and stuff, but mostly a couple years old games from the archives.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But it's like $9.99 for most of these games that are on sale right now.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Borderlands 2 is a little more and some of the other current ones.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But for the most part, you're getting games that still retail for $30-$40 for $9.99.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
A lot of people calling it Microsoft's answer to a Steam sale.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And in some ways, it's kind of accurate.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Today, the reason why I brought it up was Civilization.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Civilization Revolution, one of those games that's only $10 right now, which I think is a great buy.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think it's a great enabler for the Civ series.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So if I was going to try and get Jamie into Civ, I would be all like,

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Poke, poke, here's a $10 gift card. Poke, poke, here's what you go spend it on. Poke, poke.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But I know that won't work, so I'm not even going to bother.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not giving her money.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you gave me money right now, I'd probably just pay bills with it.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What do you guys think about Microsoft responding to this really deep cut sale thing of sorts?

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, I think they're just trying to push digital sales.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Trying to figure out how to get people interested in that stuff.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And it's all about getting them more exposure.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Maybe kind of trying to hype up stuff as we approach a supposed announcement of some sort.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So maybe, I don't know, it seems to have worked for Steam and stuff to help drive sales.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Maybe that's why they want to hype.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hey guys, you know we do sell games digitally as well, right?

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's not just Sony and Steam. We do that as well.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So hey, buy something.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A tiny correction to what I had stated earlier.

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Bobby says it was Space Quest 4 was the one in the series that Ken Allen did.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oops, my bad.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But I will say that I know this one for a fact.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Because Bobby and I have both fawned over this one.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And our mutual love of an old ass Sierra game I bet none of you have heard of.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's called Jones in the Fast Lane.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Awesome computer game back in the day.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They kind of tried to make a CD-ROM game out of a board game type of thing.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It was really weird.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You had these marbles that would go around, but it was kind of like life.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And you would have a job.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It was hard for me to explain.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It was fun, dammit.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Did they ever make a board game based on that?

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, but you would see your little character actually walking.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You could pick your little CD-ROM character and they would actually walk.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It was back in the day when all that video capture stuff was really new on CD.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then I think they had a disc version of it too

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
where it would substitute in animated characters, if I remember right.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I know that was one because I loved that game growing up.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That was right around the same time I got into Civ and all that, in fact.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I want to know something, Rob.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What?

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why people on Tumblr think that I want to see animated gifs of Caden's butt.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Because you're following those Tumblrs.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's all about what you want to follow on the tumbles.

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Wasn't there one called Caden's Ass?

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There's one called Shepherd's Butt.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's because it's like, hey, we saw that you viewed alien penises.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You may like Caden's butt.

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There's also one that's called Shepherd's Left Boob.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I have no idea.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can't even.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You get out of the internet whatever you want.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If you want to use Tumblr for nothing but porn, you can do it very easily.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's my side boob.

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Or so I've heard.

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And that's probably someone's Tumblr too.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's my side boob.

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's from Family Guy.

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm going to see if that exists.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Fuck yeah, side boob.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm pretty sure that's out there.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm looking.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Alright, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
BlackWolf, again trying to correct me here.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The only difference between the disc and CD version was the CD version had full spoken audio.

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The animated characters were still there.

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I thought in the CD version they were actual digitized characters and in the disc one they were cartoons.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And on the disc version they-

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes it exists.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There is a fuck yes I boob Tumblr.

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And on the disc version it came on like 48 discs, right?

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because that's the equivalent of a CD.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The disc version of Jones I think was only like four.

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like four discs or so.

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I remember, what was it?

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Willy Beamish I think it was.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Was a game I was playing way back in the day.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I remember that game.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It was on like 12 discs.

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, I had an anime fighting game.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It was called, I don't remember what it was called.

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Something Lace.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't remember what it was called now.

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It was like Metal and Lace or something like that.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I got into it like software etc. back in the day.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Never did get that game to run correctly.

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But damn it took a long time with like eight plus discs installing.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That was the whole reason you needed a hard drive.

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Was because you had to have something to install all those stinking discs to.

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Eh, no the 14 disc descent.

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Ugh.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's where you had to have like a rubber band to bind all the discs together.

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Good times.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I still have it somewhere.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
My stack of descent discs.

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Classic gaming, what a trip.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Alright, let's get into what we've been playing this week as far as modern games go.

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Not that classics are bad by any means.

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I mean, I've been playing Capcom Arcade a lot lately.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Playing classics.

202
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Why don't we just start with Rob?

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well you, well no I was going to say, no that was last week not this week.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But I was going to say you missed last week and I was talking about Capcom Arcade.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Did you know that the freebie game that you can just get for free on Playstation 3 is Black Tiger?

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Which you've talked about on the show before.

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah.

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And you can flip between the Japanese and the English versions.

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I was so excited to tell you last week and then you weren't here.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Uh, I think Dan might have already gotten it.

211
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't know.

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's cool.

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, it's an e-game.

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And...

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's one of Dan's favorites.

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Next week they're putting out Gun.Smoke.

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Gun.Smoke.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Gun.Smoke.

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah.

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I have a demo for Gun.Smoke.

221
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's good times.

222
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Alright, we'll start with you.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What were you going to say?

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Something sassy over there, Logan?

225
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I wonder, you know, because now that they are allowing you to get all these weird like

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
URL names, I wonder if someday we will have Gun.Smoke.

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
As an actual URL.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Like a smoke dot, like a dot com or a dot...

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, it'd be dot smoke.

230
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It'd be dot smoke.

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Like, they had it at one point where you could get pretty much anything you want.

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So...

234
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Well, I would imagine maybe cigarette companies or in Washington and Colorado, dot smoke might

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
be very popular.

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You could get Gun.SMO.KE, like Kenya or something.

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
See, now you're thinking.

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Now you're playing with power.

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm playing internationally.

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

241
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Mass Effect.

242
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Of course.

243
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No, because I got the Reckoning DLC.

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh yes, the last multiplayer DLC.

245
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah.

246
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I love your little quote fingers that no one can see.

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, well.

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Um, it's actually really good, although my little lore nerd in my head is going, fucking

249
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
collector adepts, what?

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, that was a weird choice, wasn't it?

251
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Fucking bizarre.

252
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I just, it just goes to show just how crap the writing in 3 was.

253
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Aww.

254
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No, 3 has like some of my favorite scenes and it's my favorite to play, like actually

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
play.

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But there's just writing in that game that makes me go, sparkly turd.

257
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But the multiplayer is so good.

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The multiplayer is fantastic.

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You guys wonder why we don't shut up about Mass Effect 3 like ever, ever.

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Like, for Dark Soccer, it's a lot of this fandom and all this stuff she kind of keeps

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
perpetuating.

262
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
For me, it's the multiplayer.

263
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like, I can keep going back and playing that and it's so much fun.

264
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I've been playing a lot of multiplayer.

265
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah.

266
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The bulk of my playing's been multiplayer because I, it's like my freebie pack, I got

267
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
the Geth, no, I got the Krogan Warlord in it.

268
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And then I got, the first one that I actually got with my saved up points had the Turian

269
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Cabal in it.

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That was good.

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The Lady Turian.

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That was good of BioWare, by the way, to give everybody a free character new.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Like, you know, I think, I wish, like looking back, I wish I'd done that for each piece

274
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
of DLC they did.

275
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Like, I understand their whole little micro transaction model is to make people save up

276
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the in-game credits or be tempted to spend, you know, three bucks on a pack to maybe get

277
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
a character.

278
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But I think it was a good, good gesture to give everybody a freebie.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, usually whenever DLC comes out that I have to pay for, I just go ahead and put

280
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
a 20 on it and then use my leftovers for multiplayer, which is what I'm going to do when I get Shenadel.

281
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But, uh, I really, I never enjoyed playing a Vanguard until this one, because like the

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
moves are all like poison this and blades that.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's like playing a Wolverturian.

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Mm hmm.

285
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I got Hawkeye.

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh yeah.

287
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The, um, I have, I have one of him too.

288
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The Zaid wannabe.

289
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh yeah.

290
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But like with the, the bow and arrow, I, it's weird.

291
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The omnibo.

292
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I love engineers, but I wasn't like, it was cool for a little bit, but I'm not, I went

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
back to my human cause I don't have a Korean engineer on PC.

294
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, I finally though, like this is the first time I've actually gotten a character up to

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
20 and promoted.

296
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Nice.

297
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
My class.

298
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So now I have to start over and I like, I hate the starting over cause like they put

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
us on a collector map right when I just started over and we all know the collectors are bullshit.

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah.

301
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yep.

302
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So I, the second one thankfully was a, um, Cerberus thing, but it was, it was really

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
fun.

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And the first game I was in though, I had to roll my eyes cause we had a collector adapt.

305
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We had a juggernaut and we had a Krogan, a warlord.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So it was like almost all of the, all the misfits.

307
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah.

308
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And it was such, I was amazed.

309
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It was such a balanced party.

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We just flew through everything.

311
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Like it was no big deal.

312
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It was, it was like a hot knife through butter.

313
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Um, technus in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, um, he's kinda done with the mass effect

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
universe for now.

315
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Good for you.

316
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Do you?

317
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, I mean, but, but I get it.

318
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Like, is it, is it time?

319
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You mean this is the last multiplayer DLC.

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We have the last single player DLC next week.

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Is it time?

322
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I mean, nothing good lasts forever, right?

323
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Is it time to move on to whatever's next for the Mass Effect series?

324
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Three words.

325
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Final Fantasy seven.

326
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No.

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Still going on.

328
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Still going.

329
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It took a while.

330
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It took a while though to come back and then there was all the movies and everything.

331
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
All right.

332
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Anything else you want to share?

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Should I move on to Loki?

334
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Um, that's really all I played.

335
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm probably gonna be canceling a while.

336
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Sad face.

337
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Just for a little while until I get a job.

338
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Makes sense.

339
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
All right.

340
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

341
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Um, my gaming week was all right.

342
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It started off okay.

343
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
At least.

344
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Um, I started, we were playing Borderlands two and kind of going through that stuff and

345
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
then that wonderful, um, add on content pack came out from, um, you know, 2k.

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So, I was like, okay, cool.

347
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm gonna go ahead and get this.

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes, I know I could have saved some money by buying the DLC, either the season pass

349
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
or, um, you know, buying just the DLC straight from the marketplace.

350
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Um, but here's the thing though is that I want to put it on more than one system because

351
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I play with a friend and I don't want to buy the DLC twice and the add on content packs

352
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
do not have DRM on them.

353
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They also apparently don't work very well because, um, the true nature of Gearbox is

354
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
finally coming out.

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's like, huh, you know, Borderlands is such an awesome game.

356
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Why did they really fuck up Duke Nukem, you know, forever in Aliens Colonial Marines?

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's because it's a fluke because they fuck up everything.

358
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Apparently, Borderlands is just, I guess, some weird fluke for this company.

359
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Maybe they took some of that Duke Nukem money and Aliens Colonial Marines money and made

360
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
the game better or something.

361
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I mean, but the disc does not, the disc broke the game.

362
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like, the disc broke the DLC.

363
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Well, I, first off, couldn't get any of the DLC to work on either system.

364
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Um, the people that did get it to work, they're having problems with the DLC not quite working

365
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
because they can't pick up any of the weapons that are exclusive to the game.

366
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You get an error saying, this weapon is for this piece of DLC, which you don't have.

367
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And, so that kind of sucks for everyone else.

368
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, I mean, we could probably just remove the DLC and probably have to, I don't know,

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
clear a cache or something, re-download something.

370
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't know.

371
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But, it's still annoying though.

372
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't want to have to go through this process and try to figure out, okay, which series

373
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
of events do I have to do to get this to work?

374
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Um, so anyways, so I was trying to get this thing to work and, uh,

375
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Shadownextgen has an opinion on Gearbox.

376
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Shadownextgen says, Gearbox cannot be blamed for Duke Nukem.

377
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
All they did was they put their existing material and made it playable.

378
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Gearbox is totally to blame though for aliens.

379
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Alright, that's fine.

380
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Meeting you halfway.

381
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's fine.

382
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll accept that.

383
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But, the thing is, so, okay, so it's all fucked up in one way or another.

384
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
For me, it's a little bit more fucked up than some of the people that have the game

385
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and just, they can't either access certain DLC or can't access the guns in certain DLC

386
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
or, you know, the waypoint's not showing up.

387
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And their solution is, well, we're just gonna have to put out a patch for it.

388
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The disc is for people that don't have fucking online.

389
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
How are you gonna download this patch to make the fucking offline thing work correctly?

390
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, that makes total sense.

391
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's like, fucking, did you guys test this at all?

392
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Does that mean you have to do one of those weird things where you download it to a USB stick?

393
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
No, there is no way.

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You can do that for system updates.

395
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Like, the console firmware, you can't do that for game, I mean, you can't do that legitimately

396
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
with, you know, you can get tools to do that.

397
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So you're telling me that the technology's there, it's just that for whatever reason

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
they don't let the publishers use it.

399
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, it's basically you can download a system update that someone's dumped off their machine

400
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
off the internet and have, hopefully, a tool to be able to put it on a memory stick or something like that,

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
which is, it's out there, you can do that.

402
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I guess it wouldn't be that hard if you used USB storage.

403
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It used to be a lot harder, though.

404
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So anyway, so that's all fucking broken, so that's great.

405
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So for now, we've been playing emulator stuff, because I have these modded Xboxes

406
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
that we were messing around with, and so we've been playing Super Nintendo and Nintendo games and stuff.

407
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I also started trying Far Cry 2, because my thought is, hey, I remember Far Cry Instinct's

408
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Predator had a pretty awesome map editor, and you can make your own levels and stuff like that,

409
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and the game's not that bad.

410
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And then I was like, oh wait, Far Cry 2 even has a better emulator, or level editor,

411
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and that might be kind of fun to play with, so I'm actually working with the Far Cry 2 level editor,

412
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
because I know I could do three.

413
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't really know, three actually requires that you have, well, first of all, the game's pretty expensive.

414
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's under 20 bucks now.

415
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So I would have probably picked three first, but two seems to be pretty good, price point wise.

416
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So I'm recreating my favorite maps from other games in the Far Cry map editor.

417
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So I've got, I've started from Grand Theft Auto 4, Valet of Gay Tony,

418
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I've got the Ziggurat map, which is the ferry terminal that's under construction.

419
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So I've started that, and it looks pretty awesome.

420
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So hopefully I'm going to just take all my favorite levels, or I'll just download some if I'm too damn lazy,

421
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
because it is quite a process to get that stuff looking right, and actually getting it to work correctly.

422
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So I may just download some other maps and stuff like that, and hopefully maybe we can switch over that,

423
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
because I think right now we bought another map pack for Call of Duty a couple weeks ago,

424
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and we're kind of already sick of them.

425
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's like, you know, we don't want to keep purchasing $15 map packs

426
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
if we're just going to get sick of these maps in a couple weeks.

427
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's just, we need something to kill the time between now and Grand Theft Auto 5.

428
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Which, by the way, my fucking asshole boss, who didn't fucking take me to Destination PlayStation,

429
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Dick's like, hey, I got the Z-Grand Theft Auto 5 being played, twice,

430
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
because the guy died midway through one of the missions, so I got to see it all over again.

431
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm like, I fucking hate you.

432
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But anyways, it sounds really awesome, though.

433
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They were just talking about how you can switch between the three characters during the game.

434
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They showed off one of the levels that, I don't think it was in the trailer, I think it was a screenshot.

435
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It was basically where the guy's repelling down the side of an office building.

436
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And so he's like, oh yeah, so one of the guys you're controlling is flying the helicopter,

437
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and the other one's like a sharpshooter on one of the other buildings,

438
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and then the other guy's the one that's repelling.

439
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And actually, as you're repelling the detail in the game,

440
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
you have people coming in the offices and going up to one of them,

441
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
hey, what's going on, you know, what is that?

442
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So it's just, I don't know, it sounds really awesome.

443
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And of course, he reiterated the size of the game and stuff,

444
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and he just says it looks fucking amazing, so I can't wait.

445
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So fuck the next gen, I don't care, I just want this game.

446
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's right.

447
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But what about those games analysts that say, oh for sure,

448
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 will come to next gen consoles?

449
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, here's what he said, it'll come to next gen consoles eventually.

450
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And the only way I believe that is if they do a PC port, which they're not doing right away.

451
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
They may do one later on, or they may go the Red Dead Redemption route and say fuck it, we're not gonna do one.

452
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Especially if they're worried that the game's gonna get hacked,

453
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
because that's where you get your fucking keys for,

454
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
well, they're stupid enough anyways to put the fucking keys for Grand Theft Auto

455
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and have it be all the same across platforms,

456
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
which is, I don't know why they do that.

457
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So let's assume that they don't do that,

458
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and when they do put out a PC port, it would enable hacking,

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
or at least that's how it's been.

460
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So I think that yeah, they could do a PC port,

461
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and if they do that, then they'll probably do a next gen port,

462
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
because they're gonna be uprising everything,

463
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
or making it run better, have better particle effects and that kind of stuff.

464
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But it's not gonna be at launch, and it would be like eventually,

465
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
like maybe next year or a year after that,

466
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
depending on what their release schedule is as far as what Rockstar are gonna be working on next.

467
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Probably DLC for Grand Theft Auto V, which would be pretty awesome.

468
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So I don't know, they're gonna be busy for a while,

469
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
so I don't think they can really split the resources.

470
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I am kind of surprised that it's not in the Wii U,

471
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
but I don't know, whatever.

472
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Alright, let's see.

473
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Shadow next gen in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

474
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
He wouldn't take Loki and then was bragging about getting to see Grand Theft Auto V.

475
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That ain't right.

476
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Well, it's just, you know, they took our buyer and stuff,

477
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and you know, our, well he was the vice president of sales now,

478
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
he's some new business guy.

479
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So it's just all the management people and the buyer.

480
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't worry, I'm working on getting rid of the buyer.

481
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Soon enough, I'll be going.

482
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It'll just be a matter of time.

483
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But I did say, I'm like, so, you're taking me along with, you know,

484
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
DPS, because they're gonna have Grand Theft Auto there.

485
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I mean, we don't need to send this VP guy, he doesn't know anything about games.

486
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Alright, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

487
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Minecraft, played a little bit more Minecraft.

488
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah, how's the server going?

489
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's empty there.

490
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I played some last week.

491
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Okay.

492
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's very empty.

493
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I hardly see a soul on there.

494
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I do check the logs every now and then to see if people are actually connecting.

495
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I would like to thank whoever built the ginormous N7 in front of my house.

496
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, that wasn't you?

497
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
No, it wasn't me.

498
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I do keep an eye on it every now and then.

499
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I read the forums, and I also check my 3D map every once in a while

500
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
to see if something new is on the way.

501
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Hey, that's different.

502
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Now, I was working on... I don't even know what it is now.

503
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I was trying to create this little airship thing that I have a picture of,

504
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and not necessarily create it exactly, but just something similar.

505
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And then I was like, okay, I'm gonna make this giant castle inside this mountain.

506
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And then I was like, I'm wasting so much damn time in Minecraft.

507
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I could be doing something more productive,

508
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
but I just didn't want to be productive that day.

509
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We need to build Hogwarts.

510
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh, I remember what it was now, why I was playing Minecraft.

511
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Because my wife was watching Hulu, which is being streamed through my Xbox,

512
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and I wanted to build maps in Far Cry.

513
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And so I was waiting for Far Cry to download or something like that,

514
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
because I bought it on PC as well.

515
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So, you know, instead of buying stuff on the sale on Xbox,

516
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I bought PC games.

517
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
SSJ100Matt says, I'll be getting Minecraft soon.

518
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You know, I saw at Target, those little...

519
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's mixed in with all the cards for the crap online stuff you're never gonna play,

520
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
like Club Penguin and all those...

521
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You know how they sell tons of those cards?

522
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
There was a card for Minecraft.

523
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So you can buy Minecraft at Target and stuff now.

524
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I am eventually, at some point, once I get motivated enough to finish the website and stuff,

525
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
to setting up nights to do things.

526
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So I haven't quite done that yet.

527
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I know Code Man's going in there, and he's doing videos of some of the Mob Arena stuff,

528
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
which that needs to be fixed and balanced.

529
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
He's good at all that fancy YouTube stuff.

530
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He's helping do a trailer for the server, so I don't know what he's up to.

531
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah, the cricket sounds and no one there.

532
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That'd be awesome.

533
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's empty!

534
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I almost thought about making it not whitelisted,

535
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
but it's still...

536
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
All you get is griefers, then.

537
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, you know, no.

538
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Whitelist is a good idea.

539
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You should keep it that way.

540
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You really should.

541
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I've actually just been having fun digging my holes,

542
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
which is pretty much all my houses are.

543
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
They're holes in the ground.

544
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like you do on the show.

545
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Just dig your own holes all night.

546
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You've seen my house, haven't you?

547
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
My prairie doggy?

548
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Minecraft house? No, I haven't.

549
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Minecraft house.

550
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's a series of underground tunnels.

551
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I haven't been on Minecraft in like a month.

552
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Shame on me.

553
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I get yelled at all the time.

554
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yelled at over it.

555
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
All right.

556
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I know, I keep looking at your half-finished house all the time.

557
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I know, I need to finish it.

558
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
All right, anything else you want to share for your gaming week?

559
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That's it.

560
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Wait until you hear what I have been playing.

561
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You're gonna be like, God damn it, Rob.

562
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
All right, so my gaming week.

563
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Well, I was driving around town hoping somebody broke street on Tomb Raider

564
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
because I heard a lot of places were selling Tomb Raider early,

565
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
but I couldn't find any,

566
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
so I guess I'll have to wait like everybody else.

567
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Boo.

568
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But how can you not want Tomb Raider after the Conan review?

569
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Although...

570
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The Conan, I love his video, the review thing,

571
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
it's kind of hit and miss and stuff,

572
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
but my God are the deaths in that so violent and frequent.

573
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's kind of, I think Jamie would like the game actually for that reason.

574
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What game?

575
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Tomb Raider.

576
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh, the new one?

577
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yes, because there's stuff, you know,

578
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
okay, you got to go left.

579
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Oh, you got to go right.

580
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Oh, you didn't go right fast enough.

581
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And now she impales her neck on a stick very violently.

582
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That sounds awesome.

583
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah, I wasn't...

584
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
One of our listeners got me the last one, the Guardian of Light.

585
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh, yeah?

586
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So thank you.

587
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I wasn't...

588
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Well, Guardian of Light is so different.

589
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I love Guardian of Light though.

590
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That was a great game.

591
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But yeah, I wasn't really prepared.

592
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I mean, I should have known better because like, you know,

593
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I know Tomb Raider, it was all about the death scenes back in the day,

594
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
but it was a little more cartoony back then.

595
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Locking the butler in the fridge.

596
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Some of that stuff now, like when I saw that whole impale scene,

597
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I was like, oh, maybe, maybe I don't know.

598
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Maybe I'm having second thoughts about this purchase because, you know,

599
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm not huge on the violence, but I'll deal with it.

600
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
From what I hear, it's limited.

601
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I wonder if you can still make her break her own neck.

602
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, yeah.

603
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Oh, I'm sure you can.

604
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It wouldn't be Tomb Raider if you couldn't.

605
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Because that's fun.

606
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And I still want to lock the butler in the freezer.

607
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Maybe.

608
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Because that was the only thing I ever did in two.

609
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Maybe you can.

610
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It wouldn't surprise me if they have throwbacks to.

611
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, then again, her mansion's not really in this one.

612
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
This is a reboot.

613
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's a prequel.

614
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
She doesn't have a butler yet.

615
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You'll have to hope for a new one.

616
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Maybe at the end of the game when she gets to her mansion or something

617
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
like that, she's like.

618
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
She gets a letter from her butler.

619
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Dear ma'am, I'm still in the freezer.

620
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Please let me out.

621
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Sincerely, your butler.

622
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh, God.

623
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
S2-100 Matt in chat says, Rob, just get it and have your mom play it.

624
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It could top the Conan's review things, though.

625
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Having my mother do it.

626
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Because my mom is.

627
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Kids react to Tomb Raider.

628
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, my God, Rob.

629
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What's this game?

630
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Rob.

631
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh, Rob, that is gross.

632
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
People, you paid $60 for this, Rob.

633
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You should be trying to rape her.

634
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You should be saving your money, Rob.

635
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Get a 401k.

636
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
SSG-100 Matt does the best.

637
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You should reread that in your mom's voice.

638
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Rob, that's gross, Rob.

639
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Through her neck.

640
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Come on, Rob.

641
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I would totally be here.

642
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
All right.

643
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So let's talk about what.

644
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I adore your mom.

645
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh, no.

646
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Who doesn't?

647
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Let's talk about what I have been playing.

648
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I have been playing.

649
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
OK, here's your LOL WTF BBQ moment.

650
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Like, all weekend, I've been playing Diablo 3.

651
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
What?

652
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Right?

653
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Like, what am I smoking?

654
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't know.

655
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I think the fact that I've been, like, into Path of Exile lately, like, made me go like,

656
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
maybe I should go back and try Diablo 3 because I was enjoying Path of Exile.

657
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And, you know, people say Diablo 3 is extra for was like, you need to go back because

658
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
a lot of it's, you know, patches and all this.

659
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And I've actually been enjoying it.

660
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I've got to admit, I think part of that is the fact that nobody else is playing Diablo

661
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
3 right now.

662
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So, well, I have to get people jumping in on your game.

663
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Well, yeah, exactly.

664
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Actually, yes, I have one or two people that play on my friends list, but they're all like

665
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
super high paragon level and all that stuff.

666
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You know, they play a lot more than I do.

667
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So, I'm actually kind of getting to take the game at my own pace.

668
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And, yeah, just on the off chance that somebody on my friends list is, like, you know, a total

669
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
noob and getting an itch to play Diablo 3 like me, I actually turned it off where people

670
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
can't join my game anymore.

671
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And I said, you know what, I'm going to play this through one time, just me at my own pace

672
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
because I think part of what broke the game for me was that having people jump in your

673
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
game, as much as it's nice to be social and all that, like, it paces the game a lot differently

674
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
because people will be off kind of doing their own thing.

675
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
You got to go back to town and sell stuff, but you don't want to miss some of the exploration

676
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and the XP and, you know, I don't know.

677
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Like, so I kind of want to just, I want to play this game by myself for a little bit

678
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
one time.

679
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But always connected to the internet.

680
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yes, but it's always connected to the internet, which is ridiculous in its own right.

681
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But, hey, at least I got the game complimentary with the whole Warcraft pass thing.

682
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So, I can't complain too much about that.

683
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I may have to reinstall it and give it another go.

684
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I didn't dislike it.

685
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I just didn't like not being able to rotate the camera and getting a better view.

686
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So, that was really my biggest, that and people jumping in my game, which I had turned it

687
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
off and people were still jumping in my game.
