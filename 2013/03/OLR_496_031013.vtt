Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Loserhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, March 10th, 2013, one 10-year-old game is discovered hidden inside another, SimCity launches to connection errors in deleted cities, and could more chat functions be coming to the Wii U?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 496 for this, March 10th, 2013.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
First up, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. How are you doing?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm a happy camper.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
You're in a very good mood tonight, I can't possibly imagine why.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
No, no reason at all.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Let me talk about, let me come back to that in a minute.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Also, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hi.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Who's not in a good mood tonight, has no reason to be.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm fine, I've fed myself.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Alright, then you're in a great mood.

01:14.000 --> 01:23.000
I am out of soda, and even though I had this like, what is this, I don't know, large container, I am still very sad.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
And it had no ice either, so it was all soda.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Whatever that was you got from Jack in the Box smelled very bacon-y.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
It's a Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger, alright.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Heart attack in a burger.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
It's not a heart attack, please, come on, you're not gonna have a heart attack from that.

01:36.000 --> 01:48.000
Now, if I considered, and I've been thinking about it, but it's just so much food, if I considered getting the hamburger from Lumberjacks, that is the size of like, a cake.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Pizza?

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Is that that restaurant down on Howe with the giant, like, Lumberjack in front of Jack?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
It's horrible, it is horrible, I've been there before.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Okay, I remember when Lumberjacks was like a Home Depot type store, is that just, am I just old?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Alright, forget it.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
I don't know, but they have delicious breakfast, and they have this thing that apparently is so large that they take pictures of people that buy it, so.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
By delicious you mean horrible.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
It's large.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It's a man versus food type of challenge.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Yes, exactly.

02:15.000 --> 02:24.000
It makes me think of the pho place that does the pho king challenge where you eat the, what is it, two pounds of meat and noodles in the broth or whatever?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I could do that.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Oh my gosh.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Only two pounds? That's not that bad.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
No, I think it's two pounds of meat, two pounds of noodles.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
It's a huge bowl.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
I'd like have to not eat for a week and then go in and let my stomach explode.

02:36.000 --> 02:46.000
Ever since my gallbladder got taken out and all those other medical issues I had a few years ago, I don't think I'm suited for those man versus food challenges.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
I will leave that stuff to Loki and maybe DarkSira.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Anyhow, say hello to our chatters.

02:52.000 --> 03:01.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
And I'm going to our chat room, a lot of chatters talking about Loki's dinner choice tonight.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Dark Tetsuya saying, like Loki would do the show without eating something with bacon on it.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
That's not true. The other, was it last week or the week before? No, it wasn't last week.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
Actually, no, last week I had McNuggets from McDonald's and the week before they had cheese pizza.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
So both of those have no bacon on them.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
It's very possible that I would do that.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It doesn't, you don't have.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Sometimes you get on a health kick and I've seen you bring Subway in here.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
The only reason, no, I still like Subway.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
The only reason I didn't bring Subway is because I tend to get it with onions on it.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
And that just, it stinks for like three days.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Like the amount of onions that I get.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
Basically the way, like my wife has ordered Subway for me before and she, here's how she explains it to them.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Put the amount of onions that no human on earth would want on a sandwich and then like double that.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
You know what, when I order one for Dan, I tell them to make it noxious.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Oh my gosh.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
So they put a lot of onion on there.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I like a lot of onion, a lot of garlic.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
So stinky stuff, I guess.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
There's just no vampires near you.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Or like infections or something. I don't know. It's just.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
All right. Well, it's not a food podcast, believe it or not.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It is a video game podcast.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Before we get into our gaming weeks and the types of things we've been playing tonight,

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
I thought I would give a little plug to Bobby because, you know, his show's on before ours at the Voice of Geeks Network.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I think there's like two weeks in a row I've plugged his show.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Well, I mean, we plug it every week, but this week was especially special.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
And that's why Dark Soccer was squeaking earlier.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
It was super special.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Because Bobby, I don't know how this man is able to get away with this stuff.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Well, I do.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
And it wasn't like very special as in after school special type thing.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
No, no, it was actually special.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Nor was it short bus.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
No, it was actually very special.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
It was special in a true form.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
He had an interview tonight with Jennifer Hale, a.k.a. Fem Shep, although she's certainly done.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I mean, she has a huge resume.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
She's done a lot of other stuff.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
What was Marvel Marvel in the current Avengers thing?

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
She did one of the voices in the Old Republic.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I know she seems to turn up in a lot of video.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
She was in Wreck-It Ralph.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
She did background noises, but still she was a part of it.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
So, you know, she's a very, very prominent game actor.

05:14.000 --> 05:23.000
So, Bobby actually had her on the show tonight and was kind enough to name drop Jamie's Tumblr all about Mass Effect.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
It's masseffecting.tumblr.com.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Blood, blood, blood, blood.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
And you can find the link to my other Tumblr there, too. My main Tumblr.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
But lots of activity on the Mass Effect blogs everywhere this week because of the last DLC, Sad Face.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
That was on Tuesday.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
The wank has been enormous.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Absolutely.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
So much wank.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
And basically, yes, the Citadel DLC has been like everybody's fanfiction ever.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
It really was just a giant glob of fanfic, wasn't it?

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Except Tali singing WTF.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Well, there was a whole...

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
There's a reference where Tali...

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
What was it?

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
There's a reference to a meme about what does her sweat taste like or something like that?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I mean, it was...

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
There's a scene...

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Which, A, ew.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
I've done actually the rowdy party twice.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
And I've done the calm hanging out party.

06:24.000 --> 06:34.000
And Tali ends up hungover, like piss drunk in the bathroom just saying all kinds of random things every time you click on her.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
If you do the rowdy party, it's grunt in the shower, talking in his sleep, quoting Scarface.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Scarface.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
It is hilarious.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
That's awesome.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Well, I guess we're moving into our gaming weeks.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
All I really wanted to do at the top of the show was plug Bobby's interview.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Thank you, Bobby. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
But yeah, so obviously, Citadel, big deal for you and me being Mass Effect fans.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
I plopped my ass in that chair right over there.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
I was actually coincidentally working from home that day, not because of...

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
I didn't do that because of games, so I had other stuff going on.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
So I had to just walk from the office to that chair at 4.30.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
I plopped there and I didn't leave until 10.30 after I'd beaten everything in that DLC.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I didn't do it multiple times, but I played from start to finish.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
And it was... I kind of had a case of the feels at the end.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Oh, I did it multiple times.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I bet you did.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
But I had a case of the feels.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I don't know about you, but I was getting a little choked up.

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
You know what? I managed to hold everything together until that one last part when it's very ended over.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And then I lost my shit.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
And then I played it again that night.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Which is funny because you and I are in the same boat.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
We didn't even get into the series until a year ago.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I've got other friends in the same boat.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
I mean, Becky wasn't even a gamer and she's a Thane shipper.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
And so there were feels.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Oh, I bet. I bet.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
They did that very well, by the way.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I didn't even romance Thane.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
By the time I watched the third video, I was like, that was so much fan service, I came.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Except typical guys only once.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
No, no, no.

08:21.000 --> 08:31.000
But I've actually gone through on two playthroughs of the content with who I'm referring to as my headcanon, FemShep.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
And then I have my primary one who is basically rehashed off of my very, very first female Shepard, my redhead.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
If anyone has looked at my blog, it's the redhead.

08:42.000 --> 08:49.000
And I have a game file saved right after Horizon, right before you go beat Tim's ass.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You need to be a lucid fan.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
And so I got to do everything with that one and I did the calmer party.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
I have now five saved files at the Tango with Garrus.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Just saying.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
Which you totally don't get if you are broshep and you didn't romance.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I mean, it's like a totally different scene.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
You know, I went back and watched the dude version of that one and I had to say broshep is a pretty good wingman.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Poor, clueless Torian.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah, it's like totally different, huh?

09:18.000 --> 09:26.000
Well, I'm also doing like this sort of thing on my Tumblr for actually evaluating all the little relationship scenes.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
You know, I'm doing kind of a little review of that because I didn't see anybody else doing it.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
People are pretty much sailing their own ships and I'm trying to give everybody's equal coverage.

09:34.000 --> 09:42.000
So I've been actually going through there, but there is one romance in there that totally made me feel gross.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
And that's the one nightstand with Vega.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah, I've heard that is not a pleasant scene to watch.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
That made me feel incredibly uncomfortable.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
I'm not going to say gross or dirty or anything.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
But the fandom wanted it.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
And you know what, even the shippers don't really care for it.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I bet.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
But it's what, you know, it was, it just seemed a lot of it.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
There was some, you know, out of character stuff.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
I mean, it was really funny.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
It was done the right way.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
It was in character, but fourth wall breaking kind of thing.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
That just didn't seem in character to me.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
What is happening to this show?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I mean, seriously, what is happening to this show?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I don't even know.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I like the more you talk about this DLC, the less I want to play this game.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And I already don't want to play it.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
So go back in your corner and play Earth Defense Force.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Give us our moment.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
It's the look.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Look at it this way.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It's the last DLC.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
No, it's not.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
It's not.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Come on.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
It is.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
The last DLC.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Whoa.

10:40.000 --> 10:47.000
Hey, we've got this thing called E3 and you guys have been at the end of this.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Brand new Mass Effect.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Well, it's not going to have all the characters that they've they've.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Oh, who cares?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
So emotionally attached to.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
I already said I am dying to go to E3 and be at EA's press conference so I can break

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
down sign uncontrollably when they unveil a Mass Effect 4 and Bobby will have to hug

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
me.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, they've already said they're.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Whatever.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
What?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Eves.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
W hands.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
What Eves?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Well, I'll tell you what's happening to the show.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Gamergirl in chat says, thanks to Dark Sakura.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I am a Mass Effect 4 lol.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yes.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
One of us.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Another one indoctrinated.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yes.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
You are in my cult.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Never.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
I will never play.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Join the cult of Shepard.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Right, Rob?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yes.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
OK.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Let me ask this.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
This is a serious question that dives into the anti mass effecting a little bit.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Fuck balls.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
People didn't like the ending of Mass Effect 3.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
So the large and whole.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
So I don't see the DLC as a substitute ending, but it is certainly an ending.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Well, this make up for the lackluster original ending or even.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
Remember, I went back and had to watch the original ending after I watched extended cut,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
which, by the way, I still hate the synthesis ending because it's all fucking space magic.

12:03.000 --> 12:12.000
But anyway, so I.

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
I actually got into discussions about this with a couple of people, and it's an apology isn't really a good word for it.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
You know, it's more of a you know what?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Thank you for sticking with us. We know we might have screwed up here and there.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
We know it wasn't quite what you wanted it to be.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
And and I'm actually going to disagree that I didn't really care for all of the writing in three.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
I mean, it seemed like a pretty natural progression from two, but I didn't really care for the plot in two.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
It was great game. Don't get me wrong. It just I didn't care for.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
I didn't care for the whole elusive man, but I thought that was just a pain.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
But I think it was more of an acknowledgment.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
It was it was a little bit of. Yeah, we've been paying attention.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Here you go. For me, it was a send off.

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
It was very much the made for TV movie that comes out like two years after the series ended.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
You know, it was kind of like the whole let's do let's do one more hurrah.

13:11.000 --> 13:18.000
Let's have the cast of Facts of Life go to Australia for one last hurrah and they get into Blair and Tootie.

13:19.000 --> 13:26.000
We just hang out with Blair and Joe. It would be shipping, shipping Blair and Tootie.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
Put that on the back of the box. Mass Effect three Citadel DLC. It was like shipping Blair and Tootie.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
Oh, Alan, if I was going to romance Cortez, then I'd have to play a dude.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
I'm just not feeling it. Oh, boy.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
But going going back into it, I I really enjoyed the content.

13:48.000 --> 13:56.000
I actually enjoyed it more than Omega. And really, the things I liked about Omega was I liked Nirene's character.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
And I just thought it was cool seeing Aria be a huge bitch. And then, oh, God, Rob, you're not even OK.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Leviathan was OK. I really more like just the space waifu parts of that.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Hold on. I need some background music for while you're talking about all of this.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
Here, hold on. I'm going to give you some background music. I'm going to smack a bitch.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I mean, it is kind of the story about Mass Effect.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
And you ship everybody and everybody.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
There was a comment on Tumblr where someone said Mass Effect where we're all relationships are canon.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
And Charlotte Ray does kind of look like an asari a little bit.

14:40.000 --> 14:49.000
No, no. Anyhow, but but yeah, the whole this is probably the most fun I've had in the game.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I mean, there's a lot of cool extra stuff like the arena is actually a lot of fun.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Getting to have Kasumi in my party again gives me life.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
Did you find the secret box in the casino? I don't think so.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
No. OK. I'm going to tell you how to everyone listen up.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Story time with Auntie Jamie. OK.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
When you you know, when you go up the stairs from the bottom floor and you have the bar that's to your right,

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
that sort of semicircular bar, go to the end of it closest to the back wall.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
There's a little device down there. Click on that one. Kasumi pops up.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
I couldn't find that thing. It's upstairs.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
It's in the middle level. Technically, the ground level is the flight of stairs leading into the casino.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Right. It is. No, it didn't show up in the middle for me. I looked everywhere for it.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
I ran over the place and I actually found it by complete accident.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
But I can tell you exactly where it is because Shane and I were having discussions on this because I never got the bonus Kasumi scene.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
So but I'm actually going to go back through with my renegone, my real bitch of a character,

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
and try to do the whole content as a renegade just for fun, just for fun, just for fun.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
All right. The people that aren't into Mass Effect are falling asleep.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Yep. All right. So let's shut up. I played something else.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Let's talk about the rest of your gaming week then. All right.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Dark soccer. How was your gaming week besides Mass Effect?

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
Oh, I thought we were talking about my gaming week because that was really my week.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
That and fun employment, of course. But I played a little bit more to the moon.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
I put it aside because like DLC after DLC kept coming out.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
I really like the game to the moon. It's basically just a story that you, you know, click and pick up some things.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
And that's about it. I don't really think there's any way to play the game badly,

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
but it has such a sweet story that I've really been enjoying it.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I'm going back and playing it quite a bit.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
And I started on the last Tomb Raider game, the Guardian of Light,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
since one of our listeners was kind enough to get it for me.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Oh, nice.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I didn't get very far.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Although Guardian of Light is kind of more of a side story. It's not.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah. And I wanted to check it out, you know, so.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It's a good game. It's fun.

16:49.000 --> 16:57.000
But I mean, really, the other thing that I actually did for Mass Effect type stuff was not playing the game.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
I have learned how to mod Xbox files and then how to copy.

17:01.000 --> 17:08.000
We finally got it to work. How to get original PC save files into a temp file so that they will load on the Xbox.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
You're getting into the hacking a little bit.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
A little bit of the hacking.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Keeping up on Loki's turf.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
But.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Only this is a game he'd never touch.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
But all my stuff. I mean, basically, they are legitimately played games.

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
I got to where I did cheat a little bit, but I mean, I was able to recreate and save them.

17:24.000 --> 17:34.000
And I've been able to reload head morphs on to basically, you know, how I have like my shepherds typically have NPC hair and different skin textures,

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
things that are in the game that all I've done is unlock them with the gibbed editor.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
Well, I've managed to get head morphs saved from Xbox to get them to work on PC and get my PC head morphs working on the Xbox so that the hacked data will show up.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
Basically, Becky got my shepherd to work. My red head.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Nice.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
And I will link a picture in the chatroom so you can see exactly how modded she is.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
All right.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
So that's what I've been doing.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
All right.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
All right, Loki, I know you're dying to talk about a different game.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
So how was your gaming week?

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
My game week is all right. I didn't play a whole ton of things.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Maybe I did not see stuff.

18:08.000 --> 18:16.000
I've been playing a far cry tube and still trying to recreate the part of the map that we used to play the multiplayer map from Grand Theft Auto four,

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
although I'm not sure if I'm actually going to be able to do it now because I'm running out of objects.

18:21.000 --> 18:29.000
I've used about a quarter of them already and I still have to duplicate the whole building over to another spot and then build another one.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And so I think I'm gonna run out of objects before I get the map done.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
So might be a whole lot of wasted time for nothing.

18:35.000 --> 18:43.000
And then I played I was pimping it last week, the the free bundle, which you can go online, the free bundle dot com and download free games.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
And they put out like a new set of games each week or so.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And so they actually had a new set.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
One of the games in it was called Zenith.

18:50.000 --> 18:58.000
And Zenith is kind of a it's a weird game, but it's fun because it reminds me a lot of like Jet Grind Radio.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
It's basically this looks like this character is wearing a cowboy hat and some sort of mech suit thing, but you skate along the ground.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
You can grind on the walls and all sorts of stuff.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
And it has like the story that goes along with it.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
But it's just a fun game and very trippy, very stylized look to it.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
But it's a lot of fun.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
And it also uses the Xbox 360 controller on the PC.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
So definitely go check that out if you can, because it's free.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
So that's the best price.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
Speaking of stuff that's on PC, I happen to there was one of those.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
It wasn't the humble bundle, but it was one of the other ones.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I actually pimped it out on Twitter earlier this week.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
And they had Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon as one of the games you can unlock.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
So I got that for five bucks.

19:45.000 --> 19:53.000
And even though I've already beaten it on the console, I figured, you know, I think I'd try it on PC again.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
And it's fun.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
I actually modded the game so it unlocked the framerate from 30 to 60.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
And they have some field of view mods you can do to it.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
So that's kind of fun.

20:05.000 --> 20:14.000
And other than that, we're starting to start a co-op game on the Xbox for Borderlands.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Wanted to do Borderlands 2, but that DLC just fucked up all of our games.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
So I can't really start that again.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
But we're going to start seeing sort of the third again and do co-op through that.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
So hopefully I can get the rest of my achievements by finishing some of the missions in different ways and stuff.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
And Call of Duty.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
I made a record on one of my Deathmatch games.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
62 kills in 10 minutes.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
That's impressive.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
That's a lot of murder.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
It was ridiculous.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
It was like my fun house of carnage.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
I had so many perks up at one time.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
It was not fun for them.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
That's pretty much it.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
That's all I kind of played this week.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Well, actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
Jamie talks about Mass Effect. Loki talks about Grand Theft Auto.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
What will Rob talk about? Wow.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Funny you should mention that.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
There was a new patch in World of Warcraft this week.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
5.2.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Oops.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
Look, most of the talk is on my other show.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Plug plug.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Best little Horde house in Azeroth.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Plug plug.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Live Wednesday nights at VOG Network.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Plug plug.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
But I'll just quickly say yes, I explored the new patch.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
A big part of the patch is that there's a new island.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Lots more dailies to do.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
Which I know a lot of the fandom has collectively eye rolled at how much this expansion is relying on dailies.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
But these really aren't so bad except for the fact that it's super crowded.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
So the best way to do dailies, group up with friends.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
So most every weeknight, like later at night, 10, 11.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
Myself, Alan, Shane, and Evan who's in our Horde house guild for the other show.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
We've been grouping up to do dailies every night.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
And it's so much easier that way.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
And just kind of looking at the new content.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Lots of little fan service-y things.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Much easier to get Elder Charms and Spirits of Harmony.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
And there's this treasure room now.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
So like you can get a key and you go on this quest to go on a solo scenario.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
So it's actually a legit solo instance.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
And it's a treasure room.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
And it's just, there's all these traps everywhere.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
But you have five minutes to grab as much treasure as you can.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Oh my god, it's that part from that video game show that I liked.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Where you had the Velcro vest?

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Yes, they like turned that into a scenario in WoW.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Okay, I have to play again.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
And there's like statues.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Is leveling any faster?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
No, they didn't reduce the XP or anything.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
I think there might be new heirlooms, I could be wrong though.

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
That's so stolen also from Borderlands, the secret armory of General Knox.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Same situation.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
Well, you know what, Warcraft is really great at taking a lot of pop culture stuff and kind of implementing it in their game.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
I mean, you know, it's part of what's made the game last as long as it has.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
So that's all I'll say about World of Warcraft.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
But yes, I've been enjoying the new patch.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Probably won't get to enjoy the new raid though.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I hear it's pretty tough.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
So we'll see when the LFR version opens up next week.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Other games I've been playing.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Talked about Mass Effect Citadel already.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Not going to go back to that territory.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
But I will say, you know, plopped myself down on the couch, played it start to finish.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
I can't remember the last time a video game kind of just, like, commanded my attention like that.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
So, you know, I know Mass Effect has its haters, but...

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
And they can leave. No, I'm kidding.

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
No, you can stay, but just realize that, you know, Shane and I were talking about it, you know, after we'd both beaten it.

23:27.000 --> 23:35.000
And he said, you know, yes, I can replay the DLC over and over again because it's a lot like Battlestar Galactica, which I can watch over and over again.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
You know what I think? I think that's a decent comparison.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
It's like, the Mass Effect plot is a really good sci-fi show, like Battlestar Galactica.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
But even that show has its haters too, so whatever.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
The wank, Rob. The wank.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
The wank.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Okay, other stuff. Brand new game.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
This is a busy week for games.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
I didn't even touch SimCity, which is the game everybody's talking about this week, and I don't think any of us did.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
And I just...

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Because I'm smart.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Well, I just, I didn't care.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
Like, I haven't really played a SimCity game since...

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I didn't even like SimCity 2000, to be honest.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
I loved the Super Nintendo one, and the original one on PC was awesome.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
And we always joke about the CD-ROM remake, but, you know, I never really got into the future SimCity games.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Three, four, I didn't really care for them.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
So, when they said there was a new one and it was going to rely on your friend's input and all, like...

24:21.000 --> 24:28.000
All this hubba-buh-buh-buh about DRM aside, which I know is a story coming up later on, we'll get into, but all that crap aside, it's like...

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I just wasn't interested in the game.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
Is that so wrong? That it's just a game I didn't seem interested in?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
When these things cost 60 bucks a pop?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
It's okay, I didn't care either.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
Alright, so you know what I did spend my $60 on?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Tomb Raider.

24:44.000 --> 24:51.000
Which in some ways was a leap of faith, because, real talk, Tomb Raider series, last few games, a little stale, right?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Last few games, all been reboots.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
So, now they really have rebooted Tomb Raider, and this was, honestly, it's the kick in the ass the series needed.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
It's, it's...

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
It's intense.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
Have you ever seen, I know I've brought up this movie on OLR before, but it's the best comparison I can honestly think of.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Have you ever seen a movie called The Descent?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Scariest movie I've ever seen in my entire life.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
And it's probably because I saw it on the big screen, and not everybody's going to agree with me.

25:19.000 --> 25:29.000
But it was like, it was, it's the story about this girl who has a tragic family thing happen, so her girlfriends, they're all really big into exploring caves.

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
So they go into a cave, and they find this whole, like, underground, like they get trapped in there, and they're trying to find their way out, but they're not alone.

25:36.000 --> 25:46.000
It's just, it is a tense movie, and the entire side, it's like, you are just sitting on the edge of your seat going, and like, at the end of the movie, you just have to unclench.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Seriously, it's like that tense.

25:49.000 --> 25:57.000
Okay, Tomb Raider is a lot like that, because like, right from the get-go, I mean, you've all seen the little cutscene that the game starts with, the same thing they showed at E3, da da da.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
But then it's like, it don't stop.

26:00.000 --> 26:12.000
It's like, it's a cave-in, and now there's people on this island that are chasing you, and now, like, you start to just feel bad for Lara Croft, because bad things won't stop happening to her.

26:13.000 --> 26:25.000
Do you remember the early, early leaks about Tomb Raider said it was a survival horror? Do you remember they leaked several years ago that this was happening, that Tomb Raider was getting rebooted, and it was going to be a survival horror game?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
I don't remember that.

26:26.000 --> 26:50.000
A lot of people kind of lost the survival horror thing, but there's a lot in common with, like, a lot of, like, jump scares, oh shit moments, like, I'm walking along the path, da da da, I've got to get to this, I've got to get to this radio tower so I can be in the transmission, I've got to go, I've got to go, I'm running, I'm running, and fuck, I'm in a spring trap, and like, now I'm hanging upside down, having to kill guards, like, it's just, like, it's like non-stop, like, stuff like that.

26:50.000 --> 27:11.000
So, um, and on top of that, the game is kind of like a, and one of my friends said it was, like, Metroidvania type of, and I was like, really? But the more I played it, I'm like, it kind of does have that whole Metroid vibe to it, where you can fast travel back to different parts of the game you've done before, it's a giant world map, the island, and there's just hidden shit all over.

27:12.000 --> 27:37.000
Relics, documents, GPS things you find, and just, like, like, you know, you get items that will allow you to access new areas, which is, like, a key component to, you know, any Metroid game, right, the ice beam allows you to freeze enemies and get to new parts, well, there's a rope arrow thing that you get that allows you to create rope bridges to places you couldn't access before, so, um, yeah.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
It's like Link's grappling hook.

27:39.000 --> 27:49.000
Kind of, yeah. So, I'm only about a third of the way through the game, honestly, just, you know, and I haven't even touched multiplayer, but the experience has been very good so far.

27:50.000 --> 28:05.000
I would say maybe the only reservation some people may have is that I'm a third of the way through the game, and I've only been playing for about four hours, maybe four and a half, so the single player campaign appears to be 12 hours, maybe 15 hours tops, if you're very meticulous about everything.

28:06.000 --> 28:17.000
So, just kind of, you know, for a $60 game, take that with a grain of salt, but, you know, it's a, it's a very, doesn't let up, um, 15 hours.

28:18.000 --> 28:26.000
The tomb raiding is optional, which I know has said a lot of people's kind of been giving them a question mark, like, okay, what the hell is a tomb raider game where you're not actually raiding tombs?

28:27.000 --> 28:46.000
Well, here's the deal. There's these hidden tombs that you'll find, and you can go inside, and it's basically a giant puzzle, and if you solve the puzzle, you get a treasure chest at the end that will not only give you, like, maybe an upgrade for your bow, or, you know, something like that, but it will also reveal random things on your main map that you may have missed.

28:47.000 --> 28:58.000
Like, you missed this relic here, you missed this document here, and dah, dah, dah, dah. So, yes, the tomb raiding is optional, but if you're going to go for 100% completion rate, that stuff's going to go a very long way in doing so, so, you know.

28:59.000 --> 29:06.000
And again, I haven't even touched multiplayer, haven't heard good things about it, but I want to refrain from making further comment until I've actually had a chance to try it myself.

29:07.000 --> 29:16.000
I really don't want to play with strangers. I want to try to get some VoG people. Anybody got Tomb Raider for 360? Because we need to have a night on Tomb Raider pretty soon.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
What else do I see about Tomb Raider? There was another negative thing I had to say. Oh, here's the negative.

29:23.000 --> 29:48.000
I want to find whoever invented the shaky cam technique and punch them in the face. There's a lot of shaky cam, especially in the beginning of the game. It's lessened itself a little bit now that we're, you know, a little ways in the game, but the very beginning of the game had a lot of shaky cam, and, like, I don't usually get sick playing video games, but I was, like, going, like, I had to close my eyes and look down and listen and be, like, fucking stop with the shaky cam.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
I think that person works for MTV.

29:51.000 --> 30:09.000
Perhaps. So I want to be able to turn that fucking shaky cam off. Like, it's just, it's in some of the cut scenes where I'm just, like, okay, I get that you're trying to build intensity and drama, but, like, you're building stomach acid in my stomach, and I'm about to barf from all this, so stop.

30:10.000 --> 30:19.000
But, you know, I can always look away. It didn't detract from the game as a whole, but I did want to kind of just point that out, like, stop. Stop shaky cam. Stop it.

30:21.000 --> 30:28.000
Dungeonbuster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, thanks a lot, Blair Witch. That's from Dungeonbuster.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
Degenerate Johnny says, shaky cam equals JJ Abrams. Yeah, thanks a lot, JJ Abrams.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
Tigerclaw says, Rob, any lens flares? No, not that I've seen. Not that I've seen. You do get a torch.

30:40.000 --> 30:49.000
Shaky cam's more of, it wasn't, maybe it wasn't Michael Bay. It was the guy that did Gladiator. Remember, Gladiator was very shaky cam, too, and that kind of got popular after that.

30:50.000 --> 30:58.000
Ragenator in chat says, there's one thing missing from Tomb Raider games, a full-on lesbian scene. Oh, you silly boys.

30:59.000 --> 31:10.000
Tigerclaw says, I hear you can play the entire game using just the bow. Hypothetically, I guess you could. It's more fun to use the machine gun, but okay. Play however you want.

31:10.000 --> 31:17.000
Dungeonbuster also says, it's a torrent of bad news that never ends for Croft in the reboot. It's great.

31:18.000 --> 31:28.000
Yeah, you know, all these things you were hearing about in the preamp about how you will see how Lara Croft had to toughen up and all this. It's like, yeah, yeah, I can see it. I can definitely see it.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Alright, anyhow, that's enough. That's all I want to say about Tomb Raider for now. I'll let you know more when I actually beat the game.

31:34.000 --> 31:45.000
Let's get to housekeeping tonight. Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and we're on Google+.

31:46.000 --> 31:53.000
I don't think we have anything else really big coming up show-wise. I should go ahead. I was going to do this at the end of the show, but I'll plug it now.

31:54.000 --> 32:00.000
Next week on the show, an old friend of ours is going to be back to visit, and the cool thing is he's actually going to be here live in studio. He's driving in from the Bay Area.

32:00.000 --> 32:10.000
It's our pal Seg. You may remember Seg is one of the masterminds behind Umlaud, the charity event, Rock Band Night for Child's Play, in December.

32:11.000 --> 32:20.000
So we're going to talk to Seg about some of the stuff that he's doing when it's not December, because even though I'm sure planning Umlaud takes all year, he's really not in that mode right now so much.

32:21.000 --> 32:28.000
He's working on some other projects, and we're going to talk to him about that, and one of the big, big things we're going to talk to him about is starting your own game studio.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Which, Dark Soccer, you've actually been involved with this a little bit as well, right?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
I've done logo design.

32:34.000 --> 32:44.000
Yeah, for Seg's project. So we're going to talk to Seg about starting a gaming studio and what his whole vision is and all that, and we'll talk to him next week about that. Looking forward to having him.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
You should have heard me yell at my computer.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
What, the designing?

32:50.000 --> 33:00.000
I would get one thing perfect, and it was missing something, so I would go back and try to re-tweak it and lose everything I did, and it was awful, and I would scream obscenities.

33:01.000 --> 33:08.000
Well, but you worked your way through it, so we'll interview Seg about any obscenities he may or may not have yelled.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
I didn't yell any at him, because he's nice.

33:11.000 --> 33:18.000
I know, I know, he is very nice. Okay, anyhow, let's get into gaming news then. We will start off with Loki, with what's going on in gaming news this week.

33:18.000 --> 33:31.000
Uh, so there's a lot of stuff coming out about Steam Box. If they were showing some of those piston computers and stuff, man, a thousand dollars for that thing. Nope, not gonna buy it.

33:31.000 --> 33:46.000
But yeah, the Xi3 is one of the first Steam Box computers, or third-party Steam Boxes, not necessarily something made by Steam, or Valve, but it's to spec, I guess.

33:47.000 --> 33:56.000
I don't know, but a thousand dollars, man, for something that's just a really small form factor, I would just spend probably less than that and make something even better spec-wise.

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
And who cares if it takes up a little extra space. You know, full tower, you can put it inside of a TV stand, you'll never notice it.

34:03.000 --> 34:14.000
But one of the things that they're saying they could do is that the Steam Box could actually expand the PC landscape, and this is according to the hardware manufacturer MSI.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
They do a lot of third-party graphics cards and motherboards.

34:19.000 --> 34:34.000
But basically, it's kind of expanding the PC landscape in terms of slowly pushing the gap between the average console user that may not ever want to touch a PC versus some of the hardcore PC gamers that will never want to touch a console.

34:35.000 --> 34:44.000
Basically, if we can get more users to accept the fact that, hey, you can buy a PC and have incremental upgrades, that would be a big impact on the gaming performance.

34:45.000 --> 34:52.000
And if people actually realize that, then that would expand the PC gaming market by several magnitudes.

34:53.000 --> 35:04.000
See, now, I kind of agree with that. I've kind of, aside from my laptop being able to play a little bit more recent games, my older laptop, I actually spent like, I want to say $1,700 on the thing.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
I mean, it was pretty beefy at the time because of the max-out crisis pretty well.

35:10.000 --> 35:18.000
But then like two years later, it's just junk because you'd have to upgrade everything in order to be able to play something on it.

35:19.000 --> 35:29.000
That's the only thing that kind of holds a lot of people back, I guess, from buying a PC to game on is because, oh hey, cool, I've got this awesome PC I spent a lot of money on.

35:29.000 --> 35:36.000
Oh crap, now I've got to buy another $300 graphics card. Oh, now I've got to buy some more RAM. Oh, I need the upgradement processor.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
Well, the upgradement processor, I've got to upgrade my motherboard. And now I've got to buy another graphics card.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Wouldn't that also just randomly go with a regular PC anyway?

35:45.000 --> 35:53.000
That's what I'm saying. I'm talking PC in general, I'm not necessarily saying Steam boxes. I'm just saying that that's what holds people back a lot of times.

35:53.000 --> 36:06.000
And I think originally with the Steam box, it was kind of this, okay, listen, we're going to put out this thing that's going to cost an X amount of money and it's going to be able to run everything on Steam or whatever these games are going to be.

36:07.000 --> 36:13.000
Also, they're saying that Valve is actually going to be sharing some of the Steam box prototypes within the next few months.

36:14.000 --> 36:23.000
They're going to be giving them to customers or developers or whatever, but I guess they're going to be out there in the next few months, so we'll hopefully get to see some of those prototypes.

36:24.000 --> 36:32.000
And hey, if you happen to be interested in the piston, you can get $100 off of it right now. That's right, $100.

36:33.000 --> 36:54.000
And then it'll run you, what, $999? I don't know. And also, you can get an extra 128GB solid state drive for, or I guess you upgrade the 128GB solid state drive to 512GB for $750. That's really nice.

36:54.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah, seriously, if you're going to make a PC that's going to run on your TV, just build a PC because all graphics cards nowadays, they output the HDMI, just shove it next to your TV, done.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
No need to pay extra money for this really small PC.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
We've had a computer hooked up to our TV for the past seven years. Oops.

37:16.000 --> 37:23.000
All right. Well, we are going to switch gears here a little bit before we get into the next story.

37:24.000 --> 37:32.000
You know, Orange Lawns Radio, it is the show where every gamer has a voice, and many of these voices are going to be coming together at PAX East next week.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Or is it next weekend? No, it's in two weeks. I don't even know.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Soon.

37:39.000 --> 37:45.000
Soon. The very gaming term of soon. We're on the wrong coast. I wish I was going.

37:46.000 --> 37:58.000
But we have one of the folks that's going to be at PAX East. I want to bring onto the show, it's somebody kind of special, somebody well known, not just for her cosplay, but for a very cool achievement of sorts when it comes to the Omega-thon with PAX.

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
So I want to give our buddy, and this is one of Rama's buddies, I'm very excited he let us have her on the show.

38:04.000 --> 38:10.000
Our buddy from Anime Jam Session, Plug Plug Tuesday Nights. This is Pork Buns, but we can call her Tina.

38:11.000 --> 38:16.000
And we're going to get her on the line right now and talk a little bit about PAX East and what's going on.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
She sounds delicious.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Hey Tina, you there?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Yes I am. And I heard that bit about me being delicious.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Well, Pork Buns are delicious. Magically delicious.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Yes they are.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Well welcome to the show, Tina. How are you doing?

38:29.000 --> 38:35.000
I'm doing alright. I am slightly exhausted from sculpting for eight hours, but I think I'll be fine.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
What exactly are you sculpting?

38:38.000 --> 38:47.000
I am sculpting the mask for Corvo from Dishonored, and I'm doing a clay sculpt of it before I do a mold of it and then cast it.

38:48.000 --> 38:54.000
Now, my understanding is that, and you'll have to excuse me, I'm on the wrong coast, so I don't get to a lot of cons on the East Coast,

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
but my understanding is you do some real bang up awesome cosplay at a lot of the East Coast cons.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
Is there some characters that you've done that folks may recognize you as, our East Coast listeners?

39:06.000 --> 39:14.000
I think most people know me as the Amon from Legend of Korra. I know that's been passed around a lot.

39:15.000 --> 39:21.000
And I've also done the Journey cosplay from the PSN, the PSN indie hit.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Oh, of course.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
So I've done that, and I've also designed a tutorial so people might know me from that too.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Basically no one sees my face.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
But I see your face on Skype right now. It's a pretty face. You should show it.

39:35.000 --> 39:42.000
Now, Journey on PlayStation Network, am I right? You actually got complimented on this by some important people, right?

39:43.000 --> 39:50.000
Yes, we got a feature done. Me and my friends, Chris, Morgan, Kate, and Nicole, we got featured on Kotaku,

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
and we've also gotten some attention from the company that made it, which is That Game Company,

39:56.000 --> 40:04.000
and of course the Grammy nominated composer, Austin Wintory. So we got some buzz for that, which was really nice.

40:05.000 --> 40:11.000
That is amazing. Especially, you know, a lot of people have been talking about Austin Wintory and the whole Grammy nomination.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
I mean, Journey has just been the game of the year, and everybody's wanted a piece of their time.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
So for them to acknowledge you like, hey, this girl does some awesome cosplay, that's got to feel great.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
Oh, yeah, absolutely. And it's even better when no one can see my face.

40:27.000 --> 40:33.000
All my popular cosplays, so-called popular cosplays, no one ever sees my face.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
Is that a trademark thing? You sound very proud of that, that nobody sees your face.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
I do, I do, because I feel like I give, I take away that control for someone to judge how good I look,

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
and I'm just like, well, you can't judge because there's something covering my face. So I'm forced you to look at my craftsmanship.

40:50.000 --> 40:55.000
Actually, I have a friend who has a, and had an excellent costume, but it was, um,

40:55.000 --> 41:01.000
go as a larva at AX for a few years in a row, and had an excellent costume.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
But it was from Vampire Princess Miyu, I don't know if you've seen it, Rob.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
No, no.

41:08.000 --> 41:15.000
But yeah, she used to do a larva costume just for the sake of showing off the good costume and not having to, you know, with the mask and everything.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah, exactly, because I feel like when people, when you have your face out there,

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
people tend to look at whether you look similar to the character, whether you're good looking, whether you're bad looking,

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
if there's any kind of flaws in your face, and I just take that control from people when I have a mask costume,

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
so that's why it's my favorite thing to do.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
That's a very powerful way of looking at it, I'm just like, I'm kind of like, that's a neat way to look at it.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
Throw it the opposite way with my bikin costume a few years ago, I showed off my rack so no one would look at my face.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
I don't know if that's the same thing there.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
My husband hated that costume.

41:48.000 --> 41:56.000
Well, let me ask this, because I know, I get a little, I see where the cosplay community has got to find this irritating,

41:57.000 --> 42:03.000
but you know there's those websites and they do nothing but they go to cons and they take pictures of, and I'm using my air quotes,

42:04.000 --> 42:12.000
hot chicks and, you know, dressed as Mai and Chun Li, not that there's anything wrong with that, you know, those are great characters and so forth,

42:12.000 --> 42:18.000
but, you know, when you focus on that, like, that's not cool, right?

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
Well, to each their own and, you know, for people who can show off their body and they're comfortable with that,

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
that's fantastic, really, really fantastic for them, I'm just not that kind of person,

42:30.000 --> 42:38.000
and I like to be as, kind of, float by and have people just recognize me for my craftsmanship because that's what I really care about, so.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
Well, I don't like to show off my body either and the internet is very thankful for that, so.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
So are the rest of us, Rob.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
I've actually checked out some of your costumes, I think that your work is impeccable.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
Actually, I wanted to ask you about something. Have you seen that material that they put out that's in the jar?

42:55.000 --> 43:02.000
What's that stuff called? It's like $10 and it's supposed to be, not like Sculpey, but you pour it in the mold and you'll bake it,

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
and it's supposed to be really inexpensive. I was actually wondering if you had an opinion about that or if you've ever used it.

43:08.000 --> 43:13.000
No, I don't think I've actually heard of a material like that, but it sounds really interesting and I would love to give it a try.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
I posted something about it a long time ago on my Tumblr, I'll have to find it for you, but what do you usually do for your sculpts?

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Do you do like a vinyl or resin or?

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
Actually, this is the first time I've done a clay and mold thing.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
For most of my masks, I used to use a combination of a thermoplastic, for example, like Wonderflex,

43:32.000 --> 43:40.000
or the new popular material right now, Worbla, and put paper clay on top of it, which is basically a very, very fine paper mache.

43:41.000 --> 43:49.000
But for this mask that I'm making, what I'm doing is I'm actually taking a modeling clay so it never dries,

43:50.000 --> 43:58.000
and I'm going to do a brush-on rubber silicone mold and I'm going to cast it out of, I believe it's a resin, I'm not exactly sure, it's called Smoothcast.

43:58.000 --> 44:05.000
It's a really lightweight, very, very durable material, it's really, really hard to sand though, so I'm not looking forward to that.

44:06.000 --> 44:13.000
I haven't done cons in quite a while, but I told you this before, Rob, I'm actually planning on doing a Shepard cosplay myself.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Oh my.

44:16.000 --> 44:23.000
But I have a friend who is a ceramic sculptor, and I was actually going to have her make my helmet and part of a ceramic.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
That sounds pretty good, yeah.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Are you a Mass Effect fan, Tina?

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
I'm a huge Mass Effect fan.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Are you on Tumblr?

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Another one.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
I am on Tumblr, yes.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
We'll have to talk later.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Your Mass Effect fans do nothing for me, I don't care.

44:40.000 --> 44:47.000
You know what, Tina, that's the reason we were running late tonight, is the guy before us here at VOG Network tonight had an interview with Jennifer Hale, and we couldn't shut up about it.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
That's why we were running late.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
I had some serious sand girl ink.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
That's understandable.

44:53.000 --> 45:15.000
Alright, well Tina, something else I want to talk to you about, which I'm sure we definitely have our listeners that are into cosplay and so forth, but there might be some that don't follow that as much, but they're certainly following what's going on at the various conventions, and we're going to have quite a few people and listeners that are going to be at PAX East who are going to get to see you participate in this year's Omega-thon, right?

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Yes, that's correct.

45:17.000 --> 45:23.000
You are one of the Omega-nauts for the Omega-thon, but what people may not know, or maybe they do, is that this is not going to be your first time at the rodeo, right?

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
No, unfortunately not. They're dragging me back into the fire because I was a runner-up last year.

45:29.000 --> 45:38.000
Ah, so Tina was actually the runner-up of last year's Omega-thon, and if I am not mistaken, I have heard that you are the first female to make the finals.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Actually, that is untrue.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Oh, no.

45:42.000 --> 46:00.000
I am only the second female to make Omega-thon. The record was broken by Cassandra Leis two years ago, so she made it to the finals, too, and I was only the second one to make it, and then there was another female that made it to the finals for this Prime, and I believe she was the first one for Prime.

46:01.000 --> 46:11.000
Somebody lied to me, but you know what? It still does not lessen the girl power any, so that's three PAXes in a row, so, I mean, congratulations, right?

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Yeah, absolutely.

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
So, what was the game that unfortunately knocked you out of contention last year? What was it?

46:20.000 --> 46:31.000
This game called Crokinole. It's a, well, it's a Canadian game, and the best way I can describe it is like hand-curling. It's like curling, but you're using your fingers instead.

46:31.000 --> 46:48.000
And what happened was we were head-to-head for a while, and unfortunately, my partner, Michael Toland, he had done one shot that gave them 30 points, like, off the bat, and they won it, and we were like, oh, well, that's what happens. You don't play a game, like, ever.

46:49.000 --> 46:59.000
What was your reaction when the game was unveiled? Because it's always a mystery what the big last game is going to be at the Omega-thon, and it's always unveiled right at the last minute.

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
While you're there on stage, what was your reaction when they showed, oh, it's this obscure Canadian, it's not even a freaking video game?

47:06.000 --> 47:15.000
No, it isn't. Well, before, what they did was they teased us beforehand by playing the Canadian national anthem, which they had Jonathan Coulton sing for us.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
I love him.

47:18.000 --> 47:27.000
No, I love him, too. And we were watching it, and we were just like, oh, crap, what the hell is it? And when they revealed it, I think we all looked at each other as, like, what the F?

47:29.000 --> 47:40.000
Like, we were all dressed up really mobile, just in case it was a mobile game or something, and we were all having, like, we were like, oh, is it a video game? Is it going to be the claw machine? Is it going to be something obscure?

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
And we looked at each other, and we were like, I don't have any clue what the hell this is.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
So you just had to roll with it.

47:48.000 --> 47:54.000
Yeah, I mean, we all had to roll with it, and, you know, apparently we gave them a good show because it was pretty much head to head up until the toad.

47:55.000 --> 48:07.000
Is that tough to do in that arena where there's just all those people, or are you able to just block it out and be like, I gotta focus on the game, or does that, is that really just a huge distraction when it's all those people?

48:07.000 --> 48:18.000
Well, I'm used to being on stage in much more embarrassing situations because I've been in cosplay skits and cosplay events and stuff, and, yeah, it wasn't as hard.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
So it's like all your years of cosplaying helped you prepare for that moment.

48:24.000 --> 48:36.000
I was hamming it up, though. I was giving, like, Hunger Games signs, like the three finger salute to people in the front, and people were, like, cheering for me, starting chants and stuff. It was really fun.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
And may the odds be ever in your favor.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Pretty much.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
So do you know what games are going to be involved with this Omega-Thon at PAX East in a couple weeks?

48:47.000 --> 49:03.000
Yes. They revealed it to us last week. The first one is Bomberman, the live version, the one that's on Xbox Live Arcade. The second one is NBA Jam, also the On Fire edition. And then the third round is Jenga.

49:04.000 --> 49:13.000
Oh, no. Yeah, they usually throw a board game or something in there. I've seen Jenga before. So what are you doing to prepare? Are you preparing at all, or are you just, like, eh, I'm going to wing it?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
I'd be perfect. I'd be perfect for Fortnite.

49:17.000 --> 49:30.000
I was actually just practicing with my friends. I have a friend named Norm who is a tournament winner of Bomberman, so he's been coaching me, and all we're really missing is Eye the Tiger playing in the background.

49:30.000 --> 49:49.000
But I'm terrible. I'm terrible right now. I have just made a pass not killing myself, and Jenga I don't think I can prepare for at all, and NBA Jam I'm going to move on to as soon as I feel like I don't suck abysmally at Bomberman.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
Can I give you a hint on Jenga that doesn't involve Ibuprofen?

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Sure.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Practice with your left hand.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
That's a good, that's a very good tip. I'll have to practice that.
