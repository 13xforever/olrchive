Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, May 19th, 2013, Nintendo makes a controversial move against Let's Play videos.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Virtual trading cards come to Steam, and a new Gran Turismo game is announced for the PlayStation 3.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May 19th, 2013, episode number 505 of our show.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about games and gaming news with all you in our chat and listening on our podcast feed.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And my co-hosts. Joining us remotely tonight, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hi.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi, how are you doing?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I has a cold.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry to hear it. How'd you get that?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Dan.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Aw.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He's like, I just have allergies, let's share a soda. Oops, sorry, it was cold.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I thought maybe he might have got something at that whole PinnaGogo thing. Did you go to that, which was this weekend?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He was, I think, already sick before that.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Don't.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, but he only got to do one day at PinnaGogo and missed like their annual pinball group barbecue.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now for those who don't know what PinnaGogo is, it's this big pinball exposition thing they do in NorCal.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Dixon.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Dixon. There ain't shit in Dixon either. It's a weird place for PinnaGogo.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, there's stuff in Dixon. There's pollen and a really good ice cream parlor.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And they don't even have a 24 hour Starbucks anymore. Alright, anyway.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But they do have a Mary's Pizza Shack.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, they do. And they do have PinnaGogo, which is pretty awesome.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Apparently this year was supposed to be like totally bombed. They had every spot filled. They couldn't take any more people in because of power usage.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I really wanted to go because they had all kinds of prototype machines and they had the new X-Men table and like all kinds of stuff I really wanted to go.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But Dan was sick and I wasn't going to go without him because I have no other reason to go to Dixon.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And who can blame you? Alright, we'll also say hello to here in studio, Techmaster Loki.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hi.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How are you, Techmaster Loki?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm fine. I'm organizing Steam games.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now, what was this you were trying to figure out? Maybe one of our listeners knows because we do have the live chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When we are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We do have the chatters joining us. Maybe one of them knows the answer to your question.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, I was just wondering if there is a way to... Oh, I guess there's different categories and stuff you could say.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Just seeing if there is a way to like, you know... Oh, okay. Here we go. Categories. You can add categories to the games.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Basically the folder sort. Some of the games I have because I have now over 100 games. Thank you, Amazon.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Do they have a crazy sale recently or something?

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They're still going until the end of the month. It's their like... I don't remember what they call it. Their mega sale or something.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There's like a whole bunch of games and bundles and stuff. There's some really good Sonic bundles.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If you like Sonic the Hedgehog, you can get almost all the games that they have on PC including the Genesis stuff for like 20 bucks.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So it's like a Steam sale but it's on Amazon.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Actually, that's the thing. I've been finding a lot of these sales on Steam games on other sites.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Like Green Man Gaming or Amazon. Amazon for a lot of the stuff. Even Gamefly has stuff and it's all redeemable on Steam.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Or Origin. They actually have some games on Origin that I really wanted but I am not installing Origin.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't blame you, sir.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm passing on it. Battlefield 3 was $10. I really wanted Battlefield 3.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I wanted to sell my soul to play Mass Effect 3 online on the PC.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And I really wanted Command & Conquer. Thankfully, I wanted Red Alert 3 because I forgot all about it.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And I went back and started playing some of the older games but I saw in the trailer for it that they have George the K is in it.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Wasn't Tim Curry in that one too?

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Tim Curry is in it. Yes, Tim Curry is in it. And they even have...

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, who the hell is it? I can see her face and I can't think of her name.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Jenny McCarthy is in it. She plays Tanya.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Random.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, she plays the assassin chick.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But yeah, it's so awesome.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Because they went back in the second game. I don't know if they had the full motion video cutscenes.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But they went back to the way that the first game was where they had full motion video cutscenes.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's just awesome. But it also has origin and I'm not doing that. So, I'm sorry.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Going to the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, ActDeft says you can sort your games in your Steam library.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So you can at least sort them differently. I don't know.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, I'll just have to mess around with it.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Alright. Well, we're going to get to how was your gaming week and the types of things you've been playing this week.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But before we do, I wanted to do a quick kick-off topic.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Obviously, this week we have the big Xbox reveal is coming up on Tuesday.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And we've had rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor this, rumor that.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Always online, always not. Xbox 720, Xbox Infinity.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Going to replace your cable system. Going to have Kinect built in.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I thought now would be a good time to talk about what are your final predictions for what is going to happen on Tuesday.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't know if we're going to actually have a show next week. Memorial Day weekend.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because Dark Soccer is going to be out of town. We already knew that.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I may actually be out of town as well. So if there's two out of three of us are out of town.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll just talk.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Loki will do the one man show. Didn't you do that one year?

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've done it a couple times.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, those shows are really interesting you guys.

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You can discuss pizza and bacon.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I might. If I've got stuff to talk about it sounds so bad.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But trying to stretch like, you know.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's more fun when it's live and we have the chatters for that kind of instant feedback too.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Even when we're wrong.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I can team up with Bobby I guess.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wrong? Us?

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There you go. You can team up with Bobby. But I don't think Bobby's looking for a partner.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That would be hilarious.

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But he's my only friend on multiple gaming services.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Alright, let's talk about final predictions for the new Xbox.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I guess I will start with our resident loud mouth Loki. And I say that with love.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, I'll tell you. We'll just start with what we're not going to see.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We're not going to see a date other than holiday. We're not going to see a price.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And we're not going to hear anything about DRM.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So you can just forget about that.

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's going to have to come with press asking follow up questions.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They're not going to say, oh by the way use games. Nope.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't think they're even going to do that.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Like I said, that's going to be really weird.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Although there are some stories that make me wonder if there is something coming.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But once again, everybody has to be on board. Not just them.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
All platforms have to be on board with it in order for it to work.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So it's not going to happen.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't even know what we're going to really see as far as new games.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I mean, specs. They're going to show us specs.

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They may show us a box.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I mean, if you think about it, how hard would it be for them to mock up something.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It doesn't have to be exactly like that.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It can change once it goes to retail, but they can mock up something.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Just have it there so that people can not bitch about it.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And things do change before retail.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Exactly.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think about the PlayStation 3 boomerang.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh yeah, the PlayStation 3.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's going to be 1080p at 120 frames per second.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's going to have 20 USB ports in the background.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's going to have a million USB ports and three HDMI ports or something.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What do you even need that for?

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, if you want to...

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
A daisy chain.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
HDMI in, HDMI audio to your receiver, and HDMI to your TV.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Whatever.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't know. They'll probably just talk specs.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I think they're going to focus a lot on the entertainment stuff.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
With the whole taking over your TV, being an entertainment hub.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I just hope there's something cool.

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I just don't want to see connect, connect, connect, connect, connect.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
With the new video game console, you want to say something cool?

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah, I know. It's shocking.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I have decided I am going to get a new video game console this year.

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I am going to buy one of those at launch.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
My money's on Wii U.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
For you, Loki.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No. No, no, no, no.

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There could be a price cut at E3.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It'd have to be a pretty big price cut.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
My wife played Animal Crossing today.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Or tried to get Josh to play Animal Crossing.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's a slippery slope right there.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Uh oh, uh oh.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He doesn't quite get it.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How old is Josh now?

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He's almost three.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Slippery slope.

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's go over to Dark Sakura.

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Dark Sakura, I know you don't totally care about things, Microsoft.

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But out of curiosity, what do you think might come of Tuesday's presentation?

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm actually going to second a lot of what Loki said.

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Just because I'm sure we're not going to get a specific date.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We're not going to get a specific price point.

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We'll get a name.

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We'll get a few screen captures of video games that are actually PC screen captures.

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
More about it, you know, being for entertainment.

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The multiple use.

157
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You know, pictures of actor families together looking happy and waving their hands around looking stupid.

158
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Stupid and happy. Stupid and happy people.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You know, the name confirmation.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Just the use.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I mean, I've seen so many Sega announcements and they've been the same.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm not saying, what am I saying, Sega?

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Xbox announcements.

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And they've been the same type of thing every year.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think it's just going to be their usual pattern.

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm not going to be surprised by anything.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Cirque du Soleil this year? Space ponchos?

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
No.

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No. Well, the thing was that the...

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Information-wise.

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The actual, like, tent is the space poncho.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's like you're in the space poncho.

173
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's like meta space poncho.

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Alright, anything else?

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's what it should be.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hey, you guys like the hashtag so much, we now present the Xbox space poncho.

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And they'll have EA humping them in the background and it won't sell in Japan.

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Alright, anything else you want to say about that, DarkSagra?

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Alright, going to our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Some comments on Loki's possible solo podcast next week.

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Loki's totally rational and not loud Nintendo critique and discussion hour.

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I am 100% rational.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And I am only... I critique because I love.

185
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Dark Tetsuya says, Loki's bacon pizza podcast, where do I descr...

186
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Where do I subscribe?

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
At the hospital when you guys all have heart attacks.

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's where you subscribe.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's not going to happen.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Alright, my turn.

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So, what do I predict for Tuesday?

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Definitely you're going to have the name. That's for sure.

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Finally, we can stop calling it the 720 and we'll know the real name.

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Unless it is the 720, which would be hilarious.

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Please, no. Please, Microsoft, no.

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We've spun around twice!

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I still vote for the lube.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I love the name Xbox the lube.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Xbox infinity seems probable, but I do think that's more internet wank.

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think it's just simply something you haven't heard.

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
My money is on Fusion. Xbox Fusion.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You think it's on Fusion? We'll see.

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Also, you will get...

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think they are going to one-up what Sony did and I think they will show you what it looks like.

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Even though it is, of course, subject to change.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Absolutely not on the date. Absolutely not on the price.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That will be E3.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And I think one thing y'all need to be prepared is that there's not going to be a lot of games shown.

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Because they've already pretty much come out and said, E3 is all about the games.

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And I think that's a really risky move on Microsoft's part.

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Because I can just see the Twitter snark now.

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Where are the games?

213
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, they did say they're going to show the Call of Duty ghost thing.

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That will be shown.

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But that's one game.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And that's a game we already kind of knew is coming.

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't think you're going to see any bang up.

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay, let's go to rumor wankville.

219
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let's go to the wankiest of wanks.

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You ready?

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If there's a new Killer Instinct game on this Xbox, you ain't seeing it tomorrow.

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That would be an E3 surprise.

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That would be the end of the E3 presentation.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If they're going to pull out that kind of wank, that's when that's coming.

225
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I want to see him do something like that and then just drop the mic at the end.

226
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Just drop the mic and walk off the stage.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's like, done.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Or just fire a gun.

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Shots fired, Sony.

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Bam, we're out.

231
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think it's going to be a lot.

232
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I think it's a lot about trying to get the tech world kind of buzzed up a little bit.

233
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And I think you're going to see much more on the...

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If it's true that they want to replace your cable box, which I think could be a likely thing.

235
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I think we're going to see a lot more about that.

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And definitely, definitely interaction between Windows 8 and how you can interact with things on your PC.

237
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And how the PC will work as, you know, pretty much what you've already seen with Windows Media Center.

238
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But I think they're going to kind of bump it up a little bit.

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And Windows Phone.

240
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Because, you know, it's all about the synergy between all those different Microsoft phones.

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It'll be all tablets and, you know, iOS.

242
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They know that they're limiting themselves.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No one is going to buy a Windows Phone for the next Xbox.

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But any of that stuff?

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The snark in you ought to be asking, will Microsoft let it last more than a year?

246
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Or is it going to be the next Game Room?

247
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The next Smart Glass?

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The next HD DVD drive?

249
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Or on top of that, is half the stuff that they're even going to show actually going to be possible?

250
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Remember, hey, I'm scanning the bottom of my skateboard to bring the artwork into the game.

251
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Versus, hey, I'm scanning my picture so that I can get a color for my car.

252
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And it always looks pink because the lighting in my room sucks.

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I think you will see some games.

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Like a limited amount. I think it's going to be a lot of kind of what we already know about.

255
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And maybe like a teaser reel of stay tuned to E3 for more on this.

256
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You know, like a full motion video that will make no sense at the very end.

257
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And like, you want to see what this is? Stay tuned for E3.

258
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's how it'll end or something like that.

259
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It'll end with Square Enix coming out.

260
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We're going to have, we would like to announce a game that we're going to announce at E3.

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
EA will walk out on stage and go, we are going to give our full support to the next Xbox.

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We believe the next Xbox is the future of gaming and we are going to partner up with it.

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And we'll be all sitting here going, didn't we hear this before a couple years ago?

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Actually, you are correct. They will be out there.

265
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I do think that they'll actually be in the presentation because one of the rumors was supposed to be that Titan game from the X Infinity Ward guys, their new company.

266
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh, the actual Titan game.

267
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No, the actual Titan game.

268
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When you say Titan, my mind goes to Horde House, Blizzard and all that.

269
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And I think of the Project Titan that Blizzard's doing.

270
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But no, it's not that.

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I think that we can all agree though that no matter what Microsoft says, there is going to be a shit storm on the internet immediately following.

272
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Absolutely, which is really interesting because I'm actually going to be out of town.

273
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm not going to be able to watch it live or participate in the snark on Twitter.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm going to watch it live and I'll participate in the snark.

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Of course you will.

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You should live blog it for us.

277
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And I already have my popcorn, so I'm all ready.

278
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Alright.

279
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm a little sad I'm going to be having to watch it late, but I'm going to be up in Reno.

280
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm not getting up at 10am to watch this crap.

281
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm busy.

282
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So, I'll have to kind of wait and see it later and have to go rewind the snark over on Twitter.

283
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Alright.

284
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So, we'll see what happens.

285
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm looking at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and I'm kind of curious what you guys think is going to happen.

286
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
ActDef says, I'm betting on Xbox Power 3 or XCube.

287
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It might be a little too close to GameCube.

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
ShadowNextGen says, Xbox Infinity makes sense.

289
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Turn the infinity symbol right side up and what do you get?

290
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The number 8, which can tie into Windows 8.

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Here's my whole kind of like, hmm, with that though is that we have that news, was it this week or last week,

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
that there's going to move on to Windows 8.1, which is that Windows Blue they've been talking about,

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
which is going to be a free upgrade for Windows 8.

294
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So, it's basically like fixing the problems people have with Windows 8 to try to get more people to buy it, essentially.

295
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You know, like a free patch.

296
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So, now it's going to be 8.1.

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So, it's the band-aid.

298
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I guess.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't know.

300
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Not that I disagree with what ShadowNextGen's saying, but I'm just wondering how that's going to play into it.

301
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Windows 8, it's just a service pack.

302
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Windows 8 service pack one now.

303
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah, but they seem to be calling it much more than a service pack, right?

304
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So, we'll see.

305
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I thought they should call it the Texeract.

306
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Why is that?

307
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Because a tesseract is a fourth dimensional cube since they would have, if you were going by box to cube,

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the next step up would be a tesseract.

309
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But then again, I watch way too much Cosmos.

310
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So, just ignore me.

311
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Alright.

312
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There you go.

313
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Those are some of the chats from live.vognetwork.com.

314
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Because, again, we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

315
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And it is all about letting you guys have your voice in the show.

316
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I know a lot of you are going to have some reactions after Tuesday.

317
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So, please, we want to win their fresh.

318
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Email us.

319
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com.

320
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Or you can always tweet us at OLR.

321
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And we're also on Facebook and Google Plus.

322

So, interact with us and we'll read your comments here on the show.

323
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you've been playing this week

324
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
while you wait for this next wave of game consoles to take off.

325
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

326
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How was your gaming week?

327
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
My gaming week was kind of less eventful just because I've been getting ready to leave.

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I've played Ragnarok Online 2.

329
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm definitely going to quit WoW.

330
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's just I'm trying to find a time to log on and finish up some stuff and give people some money

331
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
if anyone ever went on the Alliance Guild again.

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
For your money, I'll sign in to my paladin.

333
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Give me a dollar.

334
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm not giving – I have a lot of money on my Alliance account,

335
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
which makes me kind of want to transfer one of my tunes over.

336
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But I've been playing some Ragnarok Online 2 and Gravity is doing this sort of drawing thing

337
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
where you can win a prize.

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Your name is entered for every hour you're logged in, so there have been a lot of vendors,

339
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
a lot of vendors in game.

340
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I've been doing my weekly Mass Effect 3.

341
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I would call it my rant fest whilst playing.

342
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I've been doing that.

343
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
A Let's Play.

344
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's going to come up later in the show, so it's a Let's Play basically.

345
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No, it's more or less me just doing the MST3K thing with it and telling off characters

346
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and calling Udina asshole and that type of thing.

347
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Okay, so a Let's Bitch.

348
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's Mass Effect 3 Rocky Edition.

349
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay.

350
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
All right, so I've been doing that.

351
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I also bought Borderlands 2 because right now I think it's still on sale on Steam.

352
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It went to some ridiculous price, like $13, so I went ahead and picked up Borderlands 2,

353
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
even if it's going to make me puke my brains out from motion sickness.

354
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Dan had such a good time playing it.

355
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Dan also got a new racing rig.

356
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I saw those pictures on Facebook.

357
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It looks sweet.

358
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He's got three monitors in a little sit-down seat.

359
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, he had the monitors already.

360
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They're actually three TVs because he got the hookup at work.

361
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Okay.

362
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But his old rig, he had a fanatic stand and these chairs that he built out of the seats

363
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
from, what was it, a Honda Civic or something.

364
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So he actually has an actual racing rig that he bought from some guy in Reno.

365
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The guy came and delivered it, and it was pretty neat.

366
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So he's got a lot of racing going on.

367
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He's looking forward to Grid 2, and so I've been indirectly participating in his racing

368
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
addiction by watching him and commenting and going, ugh, that car sucks.

369
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But that's really been the extent of my gaming.

370
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
No, I played something else, and for the life of me, I can't remember what it was, so just

371
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
forget it.

372
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, yeah, Off.

373
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I was going to say, it must not have made a big impression.

374
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What is Off?

375
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I don't know if I've heard of this.

376
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's a very, very weird little RPG, especially now that I can play it windowed.

377
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's like you are sort of like controlling an avatar, and your avatar is called the Batter,

378
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
like a guy with a bat.

379
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And you go around and do puzzles and talk to people, and it's bizarre.

380
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'll put it that way, but it's free.

381
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It was done by, crap, I forgot the name, but the original version was in French, and it's

382
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
been translated.

383
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And it's something that should be looked for.

384
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll find a link for it for the chat room, where I downloaded the translation from.

385
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's a neat little game, plus also half of Tumblr loses their mind over it.

386
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Of course.

387
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah.

388
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I've been enjoying it.

389
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Just like Tumblr loses their mind over the Yahoo overlords that are coming in next week,

390
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
apparently.

391
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh my god.

392
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I am so, ugh, don't even get me started.

393
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But it's fun to get you started.

394
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You're freaking out over no news, really.

395
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Nothing.

396
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
They haven't done anything.

397
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You're just, you know, yeah, Yahoo doesn't have the best track record, but still.

398
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I think I made this comparison on Bobby Blackwell's show when we were doing the call at the end

399
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
of his show, as we always do.

400
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But it's kind of like Grandma taking you to a One Direction concert.

401
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That's what that buyout feels like.

402
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Well, that's One Direction.

403
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's a British thing.

404
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I thought you were up on all your Brit stuff.

405
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm not up on things that suck.

406
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So you do know what it is.

407
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Alright.

408
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

409
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I played a whole bunch of different things this week.

410
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So, let's see.

411
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Starting off this week, we did the VOG gaming night, Grand Theft Auto 3, or 3, Grand Theft

412
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Auto 4 free play.

413
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I promise I wanted to be there, but I drove to San Francisco to see Star Trek.

414
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Did you play the game?

415
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
No.

416
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Not yet.

417
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So we just kind of hung out.

418
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We were going to try to join other people's free mode games.

419
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It was just a big combat fest, and we didn't really want to shoot each other, which is

420
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
kind of, you know, anti-Grand Theft Auto, but we were just messing around.

421
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So we went to the swing set of evil, or death, or whatever you want to call it, and we're

422
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
launching cars out of that.

423
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And that was kind of fun.

424
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
We messed around with that a little bit.

425
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And then, let's see what else.

426
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Oh, and for next week, I have no idea what we're going to play.

427
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So, anyone has any suggestions on what you want to play?

428
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That'd be fantastic.

429
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And also, I'm thinking about maybe toying with the idea of changing the night from Thursday

430
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
to Friday, because I know it gets kind of late, especially when we're starting at 8

431
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
o'clock on the East Coast.

432
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I mean, on Thursday night, it's a little odd.

433
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But maybe Friday, we'll see.

434
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Also have video capture equipment, finally.

435
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I got an Elgato Game Capture HD.

436
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Ooh, you have to tell me how that works, because I really want to get something for the living

437
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
room here to do that type of thing.

438
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah, it looks pretty simple, so I'll have to mess with that.

439
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And then, okay, so back to the games.

440
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So I had the urge this week to play Command & Conquer Red Alert, like the first one.

441
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And so I was going to go buy it from Amazon, because they have their sale going.

442
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And then I was doing some searching, and it's freeware.

443
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So I downloaded it for free, which is fantastic.

444
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
That's the best price.

445
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And so I installed it, had to add some different patches to it to get to work in Windows 7.

446
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And the first thing I had to do, mod it, because that's what I do.

447
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I play modded games.

448
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So I messed with the rules I and I filed to mod kind of how I had it before.

449
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I had a really cool setup back in the day when I was playing it with all these custom

450
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
units I made and stuff.

451
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So I kind of remembered some of that and put it back in there.

452
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So I played a skirmish game last night.

453
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It took about two hours, just because I was toying with the computer.

454
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I wasn't immediately going for the kill.

455
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I was just letting them kind of live a little bit.

456
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But it was pretty fun.

457
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I had a lot of fun with it.

458
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It still runs like shit, though, on my computer, which is weird,

459
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
because it's such an old game you'd think with the processor being so fast that it should

460
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
be able to run a little faster than it did, but whatever.

461
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So I played that.

462
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And then, since I can talk about it this week, Metro Last Light.

463
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I played that last week.

464
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And it's fantastic.

465
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I was going to say, you gave it a very favorable review over at VOG Network.

466
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah, it's fantastic.

467
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
See, my laptop is not very...

468
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I mean, the graphics card is not great.

469
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I ran everything in that game on low visual settings, but I never noticed.

470
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I mean, it looked just like the console version.

471
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I mean, apparently it has really good visuals, but you have to have a pretty decent graphics card,

472
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and I'm kind of limited.

473
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I can't upgrade my graphics card in my laptop.

474
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You weren't the only one that seemed to enjoy it.

475
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm seeing a lot on the internet, a lot of good reviews of that game.

476
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But yeah, it reminded me a lot of Bioshock Infinite, just with kind of the different story elements.

477
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's very linear.

478
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Bioshock was very linear.

479
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
There's a little bit of like, okay, you can do this, you can do that differently.

480
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You can do a lot of stealth in the game, which is kind of cool.

481
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You can take out lights, and a lot of the lights thing plays into the stealth stuff.

482
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So there's a mode that's pretty difficult.

483
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You can actually play the whole game without killing anybody, except for the mutants.

484
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You have to kill the mutants because they'll just charge right at you.

485
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You can't walk past them.

486
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But there's an achievement you get for doing that.

487
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And I don't know, I just enjoyed it.

488
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I enjoyed the storyline.

489
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I haven't played 2033.

490
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I have 2033, so I should probably check it out,

491
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
although now I've had the ending spoiled because they kind of give it away at the end of this game,

492
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
because it ties in with it.

493
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But yeah, it was a really great game.

494
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm glad I got to play it because I wasn't really familiar with the series at all,

495
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and it's pretty awesome.

496
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So definitely worth checking out.

497
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And I know a lot of people might want to wait until a sale comes.

498
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And if it's anything like the other Deep Silver games, it'll be deeply discounted pretty soon,

499
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
because they really knock the prices off their games pretty quick.

500
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And just a quick plug, since you did bring up the review that you did for this game.

501
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
If you check out his review over at vognetwork.com,

502
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and I noticed for the live listeners, Bobby put that in chat,

503
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
but it's really easy to find if you just go to vognetwork.com.

504
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The really cool thing about the way the website is built over at VOG Network,

505
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
or the voice engaged network, is that you can actually do a response review.

506
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So if you also like the game, or maybe you didn't like the game and you want to have your say on that,

507
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
you can actually write a response review.

508
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And the way it's done is that we actually screen the reviews to make sure they're not trolly,

509
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
to make sure they are thought out,

510
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
to make sure they're worthy of posting right underneath the main review.

511
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And we never judge that on opinion, whether you love it or hate it.

512
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
We just want to make sure it sounds like you've actually played it,

513
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and that you're not just first.

514
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's not like a Metacritic thing where you're like, one, ten.

515
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Exactly. It has to be a little more thought out than that.

516
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So we will, of course, approve those, and you get your review right there,

517
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
right underneath the main review.

518
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And it's pretty cool, and one of the things that makes our site really unique, which I like.

519
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So you only have a limited amount of time to do that, though.

520
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't remember what it is. Bobby, you'll have to remind me.

521
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I think it's like two weeks or a month.

522
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We do that on movies. I know a lot of you have been seeing Iron Man 3, Star Trek Into Darkness.

523
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Both those movies are also reviewed on our site, and you can participate with that.

524
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And then the other things I played on the Ouya.

525
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I've been playing a lot of stuff on the Ouya.

526
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I've actually been playing a lot of the Pingo puzzle poker.

527
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's like this cross between poker and bingo.

528
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And I can't beat my high score, though.

529
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And she keeps extending. They have a high score contest going on right now.

530
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And she keeps extending it out.

531
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's now June 15th is when that expires, because there's not a lot of people participating.

532
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But man, I have a 591,000 score that good luck anyone beating that.

533
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Because I've been playing every day, and I can't beat that.

534
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I got close. I got 491 the other day.

535
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So I believe that. It's pretty fun.

536
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I was trying some other games.

537
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I've been doing a lot of these quick looks at different games on the Ouya.

538
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I've actually been posting quite a bit on my YouTube channel, which is just LokiOLR.

539
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And I've been noticing a lot of problems with those analog dead zones.

540
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I wasn't noticing it originally, but man, they're bad on those early controllers.

541
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's just not...

542
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You try to turn diagonal, and your character slows down,

543
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
because it's like you're not pushing very far in the analog stick.

544
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But I played this amazing frog or something like that.

545
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And the volume on it...

546
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
They have these boomboxes in the game, and the audio is so fucking loud.

547
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's ridiculous.

548
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I had to shut the game off. It's actually funny if you watch the video.

549
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I shut it off because it was so goddamn loud on the game.

550
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I had the volume on. The TV wasn't that loud, because I've been playing other games in it.

551
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
The audio of those boomboxes is just so fucking ridiculous.

552
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I was like, I'm gonna try to smash this thing.

553
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But it was kind of fun.

554
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Some random comments from our chat room.

555
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Shadownextgen agreeing with you.

556
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Vector on Ouya is a lot of fun.

557
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And Bobby is in chat clarifying something I brought up earlier.

558
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You can actually respond to reviews at any time.

559
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I made a mistake. I confused it with another feature of the site that technically is also open all the time.

560
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It just doesn't give you rewards after a certain point on vognetwork.com.

561
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But reviews? Always open.

562
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So that's really cool.

563
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So you can check that out whenever.

564
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I know.

565
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Well, our site is just so intricate and awesome that I forget things.

566
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's too complicated.

567
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Nice save.

568
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I need a user manual.

569
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Nice save.

570
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I need a user manual.

571
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Anything else for your gaming week, Logie?

572
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I think that's it for this week.

573
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But yeah, seriously though, there's a topic on the gaming section on the VoG forums for the gaming night stuff.

574
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Let me know what games you guys want to play.

575
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It doesn't have to be on Xbox 360.

576
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's just it's been that way for the last couple times.

577
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
PC, PS3, whatever you guys have.

578
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Whatever you want to play.

579
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You know, obviously pick a game or consider games that allow a lot of people to play.

580
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Like Saints Row the third multiplayer.

581
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Not going to work because it's only two people.

582
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It'd be fun, but you just can't really do that.

583
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So something that is preferably free.

584
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Like Team Fortress 2 was one that I thought of because I haven't played that and it's free.

585
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Going into my gaming week, I actually got to that point where I was kind of bored.

586
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So I was going through random games on Steam and I even went into Team Fortress 2.

587
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
But I only did like single player stuff like tutorials and bots and things on my own.

588
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But yeah, I would actually love to try Team Fortress 2.

589
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Kind of like a I think we should have a noob night on Team Fortress 2.

590
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Like no shame and like people that are a little more experienced.

591
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Like I know Act F actually plays a little bit like they could be the coaches.

592
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So we can have like a no shame noob night on Team Fortress 2 I think would be a lot of fun.

593
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Because I would like to see something like that for League of Legends and Dota.

594
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I need a friendly warm environment to help me learn some of those games.

595
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
As opposed to the mean assholes that make up a lot of the League of Legends community.

596
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That'd be my mode.

597
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You know one of the games I've been looking at.

598
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Like one of the sale things that they have on Amazon right now.

599
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Speaking of games to get into and stuff.

600
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
They have Civ 5 Gold with some other thing on there.

601
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And then XCOM for like 20 bucks.

602
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Pull the trigger. It's great. Civ 5 is great.

603
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I think Civ 4 is also in there.

604
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Oh nice. Well Civ 4 was a great game too.

605
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But Civ 5 is awesome.

606
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And that would also be a game that would make a great night sometime.

607
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
That is going to have to be an OLR weekend game.

608
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Anyway.

609
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Going into other games I've been playing this week.

610
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
A lot of the Warcraft stuff is starting to die down a little bit as all my friends are leaving.

611
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm still playing it now and again.

612
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But mostly just log in.

613
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Do a daily dungeon and a daily PVP.

614
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And then that's about it for right now.

615
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But with the patch 5.3 coming soon I imagine I'll be playing more World of Warcraft.

616
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But some of the games I've been checking out in the interim.

617
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
As I mentioned before I did check out Team Fortress 2.

618
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I actually went into Star Trek Online for a little bit.

619
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I think seeing the movie kind of put me in a mood where I'm like,

620
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I need to check out Star Trek Online again.

621
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's been a long time since I played it.

622
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And you know it's free to play online through Steam so it's very easy to download and set up.

623
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I had some weird issues just trying to launch the game.

624
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Like I sat there on a loading screen for, I kid you not, five minutes.

625
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Timed it.

626
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The game's really gone to crap since they made it free to play.

627
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Really? That's too bad.

628
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You know I logged in and I was playing for a little bit.

629
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I had fun with the character creation.

630
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Kind of making a little guy that...

631
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I want to say it looks like me but it ended up looking like Riker.

632
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But I've also been told that I look like Riker with red hair.

633
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So I don't know what to tell you.

634
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I don't see it.

635
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I think it's the beard.

636
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It must be the beard.

637
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But yeah, whatever.

638
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So I made my guy and I had fun doing the little tutorial.

639
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But I had to go somewhere else so I didn't get to play.

640
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I didn't get to actually interact with other people so that was that.

641
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But they changed the beginning of the game from what I remember.

642
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Because I remember the beginning of the game used to be narrated by Zachary Quinto.

643
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And now they have Leonard Nimoy doing it.

644
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That was interesting.

645
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Well no, the beginning was always narrated by Leonard Nimoy.

646
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Quinto does the tutorial battle.

647
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He's the EMH.

648
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, okay.

649
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Oh, okay.

650
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Okay.

651
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Alright, got it.

652
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah.

653
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But they changed so much and it's not fun anymore.

654
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Why is that?

655
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Or what is...

656
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I don't know enough about the game just from playing the tutorial.

657
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
They changed the skill trees.

658
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Like they completely redid the skill setup for how you assign and do your points and

659
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
your various weapons that you can pick up for your different classes.

660
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Because my normal class is an engineer and I always do the, what are they called, the

661
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
fast ships, the little small fast ships.

662
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But every time I would log in, my skills would be completely reset.

663
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So I'd have to reassign all of my skills.

664
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And then I'd change it a third time.

665
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So I was like, you know what, this isn't even worth it to me to have to sit and go through.

666
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Because keep in mind, my character right now is a Rear Admiral.

667
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And it just took forever to get everything.

668
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And I also had like the middle level account because I had stopped paying my subscription,

669
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
but I had been paying a subscription.

670
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So it was just, all I did last time I played was hang out at Deep Space Nine and play Dabo.

671
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Seriously, that's all I did.

672
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Tigerclaw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com reminding us, Star Trek Online has a new DLC

673
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
pack called Legacy of Romulus.

674
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yes, I did notice that.

675
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's all over the splash screens when you log into the game.

676
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Some other folks in chat, a variety of people talking about the Star Trek game that just came out on 360 PS3

677
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
and the negative reception it's getting.

678
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I seen Shadow Next Gen in chat saying, stay away, far, far away.

679
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So apparently it's not good.

680
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That's too bad because I remember they pushed it back to tie in with the new movie as opposed to the last Blu-Ray.

681
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So, uh oh.

682
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's see, other stuff I played this week.

683
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Believe it or not, I went back to Diablo 3 and played quite a bit of that.

684
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You guys might remember I picked it up again very randomly a couple months ago,

685
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
but then I kind of like fell off the wagon and didn't play for a bit.

686
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Well, I read somewhere they were doing a 25% increased XP and magic gold find weekend

687
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
because this is the one year anniversary of Diablo 3 coming out.

688
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
So I was like, what the hell, I'll go take a look.

689
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And I actually played enough, I finally beat the damn game.

690
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
A year later, finally beat Diablo 3.

691
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I killed Diablo and I'll tell you what, you'll have to ask Alan about this,

692
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
but I had so much rage during that Diablo fight because the game is not that hard.

693
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Like it's just click, click, kill, kill, kill.

694
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You know, especially if you're finding the good items and using the auction house, not real money.

695
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I don't use real money, but I use the gold auction house to find good deals on gear and stuff.

696
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And I had some really good gear, but when I got to the last act, when I got to the second half of Act 4,

697
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I can't even start a kick in my ass. I got a lot harder.

698
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And when I finally got to the Diablo fight, I think I had to fight him like seven times before I got it.

699
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It was as intricate as a raid fight in World of Warcraft.

700
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Like you have to, you know, don't stand in the black, watch out for his beam that's going to go clockwise

701
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and make sure when the shadow does the attack it doesn't hit you.

702
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Like you have to be watching for all this stuff.

703
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So it was a very unforgiving fight.

704
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So yeah, but I beat him. I didn't need any help.

705
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So I finally, and you guys might remember, I said I wanted to play Diablo 3 once by myself, no people helping me,

706
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
which a couple of people on my friends list got a little butthurt that I didn't want to play Diablo 3 with them.

707
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But I said a long time ago I was going to do that and I was going to play it through

708
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
because one of my friends was like, let me help you kill Diablo. Let me help you kill Diablo.

709
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And I'm like, no. But I did it.

710
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So now I'm going to explore some of the multiplayer stuff.

711
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's the next thing I want to do in Diablo and move on to the nightmare difficulty or whatever.

712
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Because the one negative I will say with that is that Diablo 3 kind of has a shitty ending.

713
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Like you get the little full motion video movie, which I guess is cool and so forth.

714
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And then it's like, well, you beat it on this difficulty. Now play again.

715
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

716
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Was it worth the blood pact?

717
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Huh?

718
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Was it worth the blood pact?

719
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Well, yeah, because I played enough WoW and I got Diablo 3 for free. So it's hard to bitch.

720
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And to be fair, maybe the ending is like it gets better when you play it on the higher difficulties.

721
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Because you can play it through like four different difficulties, right? And then hardcore.

722
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So, you know, I don't know.

723
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But anyway, I thought because I never beat games, I thought y'all could appreciate I did finally, finally beat Diablo 3.

724
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Hooray.

725
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And that was pretty much my gaming week.

726
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So, quick housekeeping. We may not have a show next week.

727
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
In fact, I'm going to say right now it's very likely we will not have a show next week.

728
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Stay tuned to Twitter for updates though. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

729
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,000
We will let you know mid-week because we do want to do something about the Xbox thing on Tuesday and getting some immediate reactions to that.

730
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I do want to plug our Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Orange Radio.

731
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And of course, Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

732
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And also, I thought we would take an opportunity and plug some of the Twitch TV live streaming we've been doing.

733
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I've been doing it all on the main O-L-R channel, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

734
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And I'm going to try to convince Loki to move there.

735
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That's fine. I only did it once.

736
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Right now, you're streaming where?

737
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I think it's all – it's loki O-L-R on Twitch.

738
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But now, Jamie, you do some more personal projects where you're doing sketching and things like that.

739
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So, you do have your own Twitch channel for that. Where's that at?

740
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's kurotsubasa, K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.

741
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And – but I'm actually thinking about making an actual live stream account just for the drawing.

742
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Nice.

743
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Because Twitch is more for gaming.

744
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And to be honest though, I'm probably going to be taking a little bit of a break from doing the hardcore projects because I finally, finally finished my FemShep project.

745
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
How many FemShep drawings did you end up doing?

746
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Twenty-two.

747
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Twenty-two. Wow.

748
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Two of them were mine.

749
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:18,000
But yeah, they're all done and they are on Mass Effecting, my Tumblr for all things Mass Effect.

750
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Well, then maybe we'll have to get your gaming stuff on the O-L-R channel as well.

751
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And then we'll have all those subscribers still built in from the days we used to do the show over there.

752
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
That'd be nice.

753
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That'd be nice. All right.

754
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But for now, let's – because when we're off a week, that's – the live streaming is a really good way to kind of keep tabs on us during the week.

755
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,000
We do make sure that we're streaming when there is not other programming at the Voice Geeks Network, which we always try to promote the other great independent shows.

756
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Everything from TVs to movies to anime to British stuff to American stuff to Australian stuff.

757
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It's all at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

758
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Let's get into gaming news, of which there was a surprising amount of it this week.

759
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Although I guess we are getting in those weeks leading up to E3, so more and more is going to come up.

760
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Only a couple weeks away, so.

761
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
All right, Loki.

762
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So EA shockingly announced that they are putting an end to their online pass program.

763
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And basically saying, yes, we are discontinuing online pass and none of our EA titles will feature – or include that feature.

764
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Ha, feature. That's funny.

765
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah, feature.

766
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's as many players didn't respond to the format and, you know, we've listened to feedback and decided to do away with it moving forward.

767
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Which makes me think what the hell is coming up that we don't know about that's going to take the place of this because –

768
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I think a lot of people had that reaction as there's that initial celebration, the Kermit flail, yay!

769
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The EA got rid of the online pass, like they realized it was a really off-putting idea.

770
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But then it's like, wait a minute, this can only get worse.

771
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
EA is not coming to go, hey guys, we were wrong, sorry.

772
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Hey, hey, you know that SimCity, we should have made it offline.

773
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Here's a patch to make it offline.

774
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
They're not going to do that.

775
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's going to have something that's being done by the console manufacturer to take the place of this.

776
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
The money is going to come from somewhere and I wonder – well, even if it's not necessarily that whole thing that it's –

777
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Microtransactions?

778
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I think it's increased DLC.

779
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I think that's where they're going to make – and remember this point because I'm going to bring it up again later in the show.

780
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
We get into something else involving EA.

781
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But I think the whole DLC and the microtransactions is how they're going to make up the money.

782
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I think you're going to see more games that really rely on that to make their – why not?

783
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It works for Facebook and free-to-play games and a lot of companies unfortunately are moving into that dangerous space where it's like,

784
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,000
oh, well, people – the consumer wants to play a Facebook game and they want to buy all these little free tools and energy packs.

785
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
They got rid of that. They got out of that though.

786
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And I don't know. There's a part of me that's like that's got to be something.

787
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I don't doubt that they're going to charge you $60 for a game and have a bunch of crappy DLC for it.

788
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Or some good DLC, but probably a lot of crappy DLC.

789
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Do you think that possibly the relationship with GameStop came into this?

790
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Do you think maybe GameStop maybe choked a bitch, so to speak?

791
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And GameStop might have been like, you know, our retail people don't really push your games because you don't get the same value out of that.

792
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And we kind of like to push the 2K sports games that don't have the online passes.

793
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I don't even know if that would have really – I think that maybe they just found that they weren't making a whole ton of money off of it.

794
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Maybe they think that their games are so awesome that people are just buying them new anyways.

795
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Although, I don't know. It's just – it's weird. I don't know really what they would be thinking.

796
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:55,000
But do I think other publishers are going to follow suit because, you know, hey, EA did it and so everybody else started doing it? No.

797
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I mean, if you already think about it, you have one less studio that's going to be doing that.

798
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Deep Silver not following suit with like THQ's decision to do online passes for their games, so you're not going to see it through them.

799
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I don't think Take-Two's doing that for WWE 2K14, so you're not going to have that happening.

800
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Really, the only companies left would be Ubisoft.

801
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Well, Warner Games, they still might do that.

802
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:33,000
But, you know, really their next big game coming out is, you know, Batman Arkham Origins, which doesn't have an online component.

803
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:43,000
But last time with Arkham Asylum, they had the whole Catwoman DLC, which was the sort of online pass, pre-order bonus, whatever you want to call it.

804
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And then, so yeah, Ubisoft and Sony, really, Sony first party would be the, you know, the other ones that have that in there.

805
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Dark Sakura, what do you think about the whole EA getting rid of the online pass?

806
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I think it's a, I mean, a smart move for one thing, but I think that they're going to replace it with something more nefarious.

807
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I trust EA as far as I can pick up their entire headquarter building and push it.

808
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Well, I think this is a good excuse to check in with the listeners here for a minute, and I think we're going to do a live poll.

809
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
How's that sound?

810
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Alright, we're going to go to vognetwork.com, and specifically live.vognetwork.com, and we're going to ask our question of the live listeners.

811
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And tonight's question is, why did EA get rid of the online pass?

812
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And here's some of the options collected from what the hosts have said so far.

813
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
They are truly trying to look less evil. There's something about the new consoles.

814
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,000
They're going to rely on increased DLC. GameStop put them in a chokehold, or something else.

815
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You can vote now. Register participants at live.vognetwork.com will see the poll up there on the site and can vote right now.

816
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And you'll see that under the chat box at live.vognetwork.com. We'll go over those results there in just a minute.

817
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The cool thing is that once you vote, you can actually see the results come in live.

818
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And so far, everybody is saying there's something about the new consoles, dot, dot, dot.

819
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But see, they've already talked about the PlayStation 4, and they've said that there's nothing preventing used games.

820
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So I don't know if there is going to be anything with new consoles.

821
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Maybe they just decided, hey, you know what? We're just not making a ton of money off of this.

822
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Although, I thought they said they were making quite a bit of money. So why would you just get rid of money, or give up on that?

823
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Exactly. I mean, is it really that much of a trying to save face after what happened with SimCity? I don't...

824
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Because people are kind of expecting that. Anyways, maybe... I don't know. I don't really know what their thought process could be.

825
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I guess we'll find out. We're definitely not going to find out on Tuesday.

826
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
They're not going to say, hey, by the way, we're going to have a feature that's going to prevent you from buying used games.

827
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Yeah, the negative stuff, or anything that can be perceived as negative, that's not coming out on Tuesday.

828
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
They're not going to come out on stage and say, oh yeah, this Xbox has to always be online, or you'll get kicked off.

829
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That's not something they would ever say. That's something that will have to get yanked out of them.

830
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I think it would be cool if they did address all those, like if they had actual responses that were positive.

831
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Like, it's not always online. We've heard your worries, and it's not.

832
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
All the guy talking, all the talking head would have to do is get up there and say, you know,

833
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and don't worry, if I lose my internet connection, I can still play the game.

834
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So, stop tweeting about it. You know, or just make a little joke about it.

835
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Like, that's all they would need to do. And everybody could laugh it off.

836
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Like an old sitcom at the end. Anyhow.

837
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Alright, let's see. I'm going to check the results here.

838
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Still 58% of the vote. There's something about the new consoles.

839
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
No votes for games? Stop putting them in a chokehold, though. People don't think that seems to be it.

840
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So, a large amount of people as well. 30%. They're going to rely on increased DLC.

841
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
About 8% right now saying they are truly trying to look less evil.

842
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So, 8% giving them the benefit of the doubt there.

843
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So, we'll see. I'll check in with that poll one more time after this story.

844
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Give you guys a last chance to vote there at live.vognetwork.com.

845
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
This is getting a little bit of controversy this week.

846
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
This story that's going around about a game that isn't even out here in America,

847
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
but a lot of people here have an opinion on it.

848
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
The game is in Japan only. Nintendo of Japan makes this series called Tomodachi Collection New Life.

849
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
This is a game that's on the 3DS.

850
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And from my understanding of the game, I'm not going to confess to know a whole lot about this game,

851
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
but it's kind of Nintendo's answer to the Sims slash Animal Crossing.

852
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And it uses Miis and it's one of those life simulation type of games.

853
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Well, apparently there is a glitch in the game.

854
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And according to some people in Japan, what happens with the glitch is that the glitch enables same sex marriages to appear.

855
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And what you do, you bring your Miis over to the 3DS using the Miis transfer tool,

856
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and somehow this glitch will allow your character to bathe with characters of the same gender,

857
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:28,000
make babies, defy the laws of science and everything, and raise babies and all that stuff with the whole same gender.

858
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And obviously, places like Tumblr are very, and the story actually says this,

859
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Hey, it's true though, places like Tumblr and some of the fan sites are very happy about this,

860
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
and posting their pictures of their happy little gay family and so forth.

861
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And you know, obviously as a gay guy myself, I like to see a lot of this stuff that's positive in games.

862
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And I love the way The Sims does it. The Sims is a great model.

863
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It's like one of those games where it's like, you know, The Sims just will like whatever they like.

864
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Whatever you want them to like. There's just no rules or things like that.

865
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
But in this game it's unfortunately unintended, and they're going to patch it out.

866
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The patch in the near future will fix some other bugs that happen because of the same sex marriages.

867
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Because the same sex marriages will lead to the inability to boot up the game,

868
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
the inability to save, getting a notice on home menus notification that a child will be sent on a journey,

869
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
but no actual message is there. That's clearly something in the game that I don't know much about,

870
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
because I don't know the series very well.

871
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But a lot of people...

872
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Since they're taking the Republican route, you know.

873
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Well, here's the thing. There's a lot of people out there that are like,

874
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
and you know the way games journalism works where it's copy paste, copy paste,

875
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
but make the headline more sensationalist each time is that Nintendo bans same sex marriage from their game.

876
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
You know, or something. It's...

877
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Okay, maybe the way this really is is that Nintendo didn't plan to put same sex marriage in their game.

878
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It ended up there anyway through a bug, which will also cause save files to corrupt and so forth,

879
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
so they've got to do something about it.

880
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You know, I don't think they're necessarily trying to patch out the gay marriage,

881
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
but that wasn't supposed to be there in the first place.

882
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So I'm not as upset about this as you might think.

883
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I mean, again, I'm gay myself and I like to see this stuff in games,

884
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
but I also realize a lot of Japanese games don't have gay marriage stuff in their games.

885
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Final Fantasy XI, you could marry in that game, but they didn't do same gender weddings.

886
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It was something they were thinking about or whatever, but they never did it.

887
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I was like that for Ragnarok Online.

888
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Did they do same genders in Ragnarok?

889
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Yeah, they did. You had like marriage skills.

890
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Like if you married your character, you could teleport to wherever your character was

891
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
or do like healing stuff.

892
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
But they didn't have it to where it would be same gendered,

893
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:01,000
and people who took private servers actually had to modify some of the programming in the game to enable it.

894
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says,

895
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
From what I read of the story, the fix is only for the problems with the side effects caused by the glitch.

896
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And that would be a great way to kind of resolve this scenario,

897
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
so that way it's like, okay, if people kind of figured out how to work the system

898
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
and get two guys in there, then whatever.

899
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And I think that's a good way to do it.

900
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And I think we are headed in the right direction, folks, culturally.

901
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Like I look at games like Mass Effect, and yes, I know here I am bringing up that game again,

902
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
but guys, it's done so well in that series that there's a reason why I really love Mass Effect.

903
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And games like The Sims and other games.

904
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And you look at what's happening culturally is that, what did we have?

905
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Three states that went for same-sex marriage in the past, what, two weeks or something like that?

906
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Like, you know, the times are changing.

907
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And, you know, eventually this is something that when the culture changes,

908
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
the games that are commentary on culture, such as a game like Tomodachi Collection,

909
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
will update to reflect that as well.

910
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
But, you know, for right now, I don't believe gay marriage is legal in Japan,

911
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
so it's probably why they didn't think to really put it in there as a fully fleshed out thing,

912
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
and why it is still kind of a bug that the two guys actually make the baby.

913
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Which, you know, you would, obviously is not biologically possible,

914
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
although certainly there are many, many, many, many other ways for gay couples,

915
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
both male and female, to adopt a baby or have a surrogate or whatever to do that.

916
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
You do know science is working on that, right?

917
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I wouldn't doubt it, and there was the whole pregnant man thing a while ago, but that's, you know-

918
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Biolog- physically.

919
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Right.

920
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Female parts.

921
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Right.

922
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And a dude.

923
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Right. Biologically.

924
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Yes.

925
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But they actually are working on using cloning technology so that two people of the same gender can have a child together.

926
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Mm-hmm.

927
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So, just kidding. Science?

928
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So, I think generally, culturally, and I'm not trying to get too political on this show,

929
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
but obviously, you know, it's an issue that's kind of important to me.

930
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It's one of those things where it's like, you know, it's more and more becoming not a big fucking deal,

931
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
and that's really what this should be, is it's not a big fucking deal

932
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
if two guys want to do something that doesn't affect your life whatsoever, you know what I mean?

933
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It's just, you know.

934
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox.

935
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So, what do you think, DarkSakura, about this Tomodachi collection?

936
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I think people are just, I think, unfortunately, the sensationalism of certain gaming websites and so forth

937
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
tended to make this story a bigger deal than it is,

938
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
but I think certainly there's got to be Nintendo kind of looking at this going,

939
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
oh, well, I guess if people are going to have these tumblers and so forth about it,

940
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
maybe this is something we should have thought of putting into their first place.

941
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Anna, what do you think, Jamie?

942
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Uh, I think it should have been there from the get-go.

943
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Mm-hmm.

944
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And if it's possible, I mean, clearly the glitch is causing some problems,

945
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and I have no problem with them fixing those effects of the glitch,

946
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
but I would want them to see them leave in the option, actually even make it,

947
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
if they could incorporate some way to make that a regular feature in the game,

948
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,000
instead of just it being a glitch, and using that to fix the problems,

949
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
then that would be the way I would go.

950
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And I would also request that they actually bring this game over to America,

951
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
so I can feel like I know what the fuck I'm talking about with this game,

952
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
because I'm going to be honest, I don't.

953
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I can only really go off of screenshots and little YouTubes

954
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and things I see of the game and my assumptions.

955
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I would play it.

956
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Yeah, I'd like to know a little more about what this game is in the first place.

957
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Well, Tomogachi means friend, so it's buddy game.

958
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
All right.

959
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
All right, well, let's move on.

960
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Oh, quickly, I'm going to close out the poll here.

961
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Here's the final results of our poll.

962
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
The winner, why did EA get rid of the online pass?

963
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
57% of the vote.

964
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
There's something about the new consoles.

965
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Second place, they're going to rely on increased DLC.

966
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So there you go.

967
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Those are the results of the live poll.

968
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Thank you guys for voting at live.vognetwork.com.

969
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Let's move on to the next story, DarkSakura.

970
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:16,000
In other news, now, this is probably why I've had Sega on the brain for a little while,

971
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,000
is Sega is, well, we've always known that Sega's been in bed with Nintendo.

972
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
We have no idea what they're doing in this bed, but they're doing stuff.

973
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:35,000
In this case, Sega has announced that they are in an exclusive partnership with Nintendo of America.

974
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
They are gay married to Nintendo, having clone babies in the form of a hedgehog.

975
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Basically, Nintendo consoles are going to be exclusive for the next three Sonic the Hedgehog titles.

976
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And they put out the announcement via Nintendo Direct during the week.

977
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And they've only put out the names of the first two titles.

978
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,000
The third one is still to be announced, but these are Wii U and 3DS.

979
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,000
They're saying that it would be the ideal platform, that's a quote, to showcase Sonic.

980
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Of course, though, since people aren't buying Wii U's,

981
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Sega is once again showing that their business sense is kind of in the US.

982
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And this is Sega of America and Sega Europe. I didn't see the official Sega of Japan.

983
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Is this really a big deal, though? Because, I mean, Sonic games, not known for their quality these days so much.

984
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
They've had several Sonic games that have been exclusive to the Nintendo platform.

985
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Sonic Colors, Sonic and the Secret Rings.

986
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Mario and Sonic in the Olympics, which sells really well. Those games sell very well.

987
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah.

988
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah.

989
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Which they're doing another, which is one of those three games they're doing, which makes sense.

990
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But yeah, but that also, it sold well because the Wii sold well, right?

991
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Yeah, definitely.

992
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
But the Wii U is not.

993
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Well, that's going to suck for Sega then, I guess.

994
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Because Sega's really had, especially Sega of America, had a great track record.

995
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I wish they'd come out and said it's going to be Phantasy Star Online 2 that's going to be on the Wii U.

996
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
That would have given me something to get really excited about, which I'm surprised something like that isn't happening.

997
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Well, you never know. E3 might be interesting.

998
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Speaking of which, Rob, you need to play that with me on PC.

999
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Is there an English patch yet for that?

1000
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Yeah, it's mostly English. It's English enough that you could be able to play it.

1001
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I might have to do that. We'll see.

1002
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
It's actually super fun. It's exactly like the last one, so it's good.

1003
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Shadow Next Gen in our chat room with an interesting perspective saying,

1004
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Rob, with Nintendo helping to work on Sonic now though, maybe it will have that magic Nintendo polish that a lot of first party Nintendo titles have.

1005
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Could Nintendo's involvement make this sweeter?

1006
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And actually I do have to make a slight rebuttal, which I've said in the chat room.

1007
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Sonic Generations was pretty damn good.

1008
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Okay, fair enough.

1009
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But it was also out on multiple platforms.

1010
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And I got it on PC. It's fun on PC.

1011
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So I don't think it's going to make a difference. It just has to not be a turd of a game.

1012
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
You know, like, what was the last really big turd in the Sonic franchise?

1013
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Sonic Adventure 2? No, Sonic Adventure 2 was okay. The first Sonic Adventure was good.

1014
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Sonic 4.

1015
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Sonic 4.

1016
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yeah.

1017
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It was a huge turd.

1018
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Yeah.

1019
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It didn't even do much in the way of being fun. It just wasn't.

1020
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Tigerclaw theorizes in our chat room, what if part of the deal with Sega was that one of the Nintendo characters makes a cameo somewhere in the new Sonic game?

1021
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Oh boy.

1022
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Do you think that plumber can run that fast?

1023
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Anything's possible. Anything's possible.

1024
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Alright, so we will see what happens with this partnership.

1025
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Some other stuff coming out of the Nintendo Direct though. Loki?

1026
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Yeah, they finally announced a date for Wonderful 101, which is on September 15th in North America and August 23rd in Europe.

1027
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And that's all they said about it. So fantastic.

1028
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Also, Super Luigi U, the DLC is arriving on the 20th of June.

1029
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And then if you don't want to get it as DLC, you can pay an extra $10 and get a standalone disc, which is coming out August 25th.

1030
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I think the reason they're doing that is just to say, hey look, we have games coming out for the Wii U.

1031
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Because I don't know why else it would do that.

1032
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I kind of figured they would do that later on when they do a game of the year edition of New Super Mario Brothers with New Luigi U.

1033
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Because again, not every household in America is online.

1034
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Granted, if you're not online but you have a Wii U, I'm not sure how that works.

1035
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:05,000
You must live in a real remote part of the US or something, but I think there's enough people without online that justify it.

1036
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Also, the Wii U could be in a kid's bedroom, which maybe doesn't have online or something, you know?

1037
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I guess. But they're putting it out, so I guess that's kind of cool.

1038
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And then last but not least, this is kind of neat because I'm not going to E3.

1039
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
So you get to play unreleased Wii U games at Best Buy during E3.

1040
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
They're going to have demo kiosks at over 100 locations.

1041
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And I guess it's going to be happening starting June 9th.

1042
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
And no idea what games are going to be there.

1043
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I think, I want to say that the Mario and Sonic at the Olympics is going to be there and New Luigi U.

1044
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And then, don't know about the other stuff.

1045
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
But they're going to have some games there.

1046
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So I actually probably will go check that out just because I don't get to go to E3.

1047
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Very interesting how Nintendo is really changing up the E3 strategy this year.

1048
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I mean, granted, we had a couple years ago, and I think this still happens to some extent,

1049
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Microsoft, I remember one year, went very big on bringing E3 home where you could download all the demos and so forth.

1050
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I really wish they would do that. That was awesome. That was in 2006.

1051
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And it was fantastic because it's like, hey, we just showed you this awesome Lost Planet game.

1052
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Now you can go download it.

1053
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And then download them for MotoGP. They have like three or four games on there.

1054
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And that was awesome. And now they don't do that anymore.

1055
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I mean, I really wish they would do that because a lot of, well, the majority of the people that are paying attention to E3 can't go to that.

1056
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Why do you think Nintendo is making you go to Best Buy and not just letting you download them to your Wii U?

1057
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Partnership.

1058
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I bet it's part partnership and it's also part so you can get the sales pitch while you're there about picking up a Wii U.

1059
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Because, you know, Nintendo has, just like Microsoft and just like any other company, has the people that go out to the stores.

1060
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Well, they're trying to sell the console too because the problem isn't getting people that own the Wii U to buy more games.

1061
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
It's getting people to buy the Wii U.

1062
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Right. So why not have those people in the stores ready to try to sell the consoles?

1063
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I think it's a great, great concept.

1064
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Don't you want to buy a console today?

1065
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
No.

1066
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Especially if they end up dropping the price, which I know is a long shot.

1067
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
But, you know, now it's on sale. It's even cheaper than it was before. Don't you want to get one?

1068
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Have somebody there to put on a little bit of that pressure.

1069
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Do you think we'll see a Wii U Animal Crossing this year?

1070
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
A Wii U Animal Crossing this year? No, not with the 3DS. We cannibalized the 3DS one too much.

1071
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Probably next year.

1072
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Because that one is going to be coming out within weeks of E3. So, yeah, probably next year.

1073
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Like it's really going to be anything innovative.

1074
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Yeah, right. Well, you can sit down now.

1075
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Ooh! You know what? I could sit down before. I could go get a latte and sit down.

1076
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
But now you can. What were the other big things? There's benches.

1077
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
You're the mayor. You can swim.

1078
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Well, okay, so to be fair, they did kind of change the main plot of sorts.

1079
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Yeah, I'm sorry, but does it have virtual console games like it did in the GameCube version? Because that was awesome.

1080
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I actually liked my indentured servitude to Tom Nook.

1081
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And considering that we're selling virtual console games for 30 cents, why can't you put some NES games in there?

1082
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's not like you're losing money on that.

1083
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,000
So Nintendo really wants to change the rules this year because they're doing the whole forget the press conference,

1084
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
we're going to do Nintendo Direct, and now we're going to be taking the show on the road to Best Buy 2.

1085
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
They are literally taking their case directly to fans. I do think it's smart, though, in the position Nintendo's in.

1086
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
There's too much fucking smart when it comes to Nintendo on the internet, and then that kind of spills over into the media.

1087
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So Nintendo's just like, you know what? We're going to take our case directly to the fanboys who will pitch up a storm.

1088
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Yeah.

1089
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Who needs PR when you got people to do it for free?

1090
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Exactly. Exactly. So it's going to be interesting. I'm curious to see how this works out for them because it could be a game changer.

1091
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I am not going to sit here, though, and say E3 is dead or dying because there was a time when E3 didn't have anything to do with the media and all this stuff.

1092
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:14,000
You know, before the internet, there was still E3, and granted, you would see screenshots and things of Nintendo power,

1093
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:22,000
but it was not the blowout thing that it is today. E3 started because it's the one time during the year when everybody in the industry kind of gets together under the same roof,

1094
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and there's a lot of wheeling and dealing that happens at E3 that the media doesn't even know about.

1095
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Like, think about it. One year I went to E3, I think it was 2006, maybe it was, it might have been 2010, I don't know.

1096
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Apple had a booth at E3, or excuse me, not a booth. Apple had a conference room at E3.

1097
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,000
It was a behind closed doors thing, and a lot of people were thinking, ooh, is Apple doing a game console? Ooh, ooh, you know, and that whole thing.

1098
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
No, Apple was probably showing off the iPhone or the iPad, depending on whatever year it was.

1099
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
That's probably what they were showing in that little room to developers who were there at the same roof.

1100
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,000
That had nothing to do with the media. Apple was not rolling that out to the media yet, but Apple was probably, and again, this is a huge theory here,

1101
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:09,000
because I don't know anything, but I'm assuming that that's part of the wheeling and dealing that happens at E3 that has nothing to do with the media interaction.

1102
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:17,000
The media could not come to E3, and E3 I think would still happen. It might not be as big of a deal, but I think there would still be the necessity for the show.

1103
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So, anyhow, tangent. But let's move on with something that doesn't have to do with Nintendo.

1104
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It has to do with Steam, which we brought up earlier in the show. Kind of something interesting on Steam. It's called Steam Trading Cards, and it's...

1105
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I forgot I played Portal 2 because of this.

1106
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Did you get in the beta for this?

1107
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Yes. I actually have three extra passes I can share.

1108
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Give me one, because I went into the beta and I wanted to get this. Alright, well, maybe give some away to listeners or something.

1109
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,000
But anyway, Steam Trading Cards are the new thing from Valve, and maybe you can speak on this better than I can, Logie.

1110
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Yes, Steam Trading Cards, they let you get Steam rewards when you play the game, so they're not the achievements, but achievements that will actually unlock these cards

1111
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:14,000
that you can then use to, when you get a set together, get a new background or an increase in your friends list or something like that.

1112
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
It's like hats for non-hat games, because you can generate these, too.

1113
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Oh, can you pay for them?

1114
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I think, well, the trading. I think maybe there might be some money exchanged.

1115
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Well, they're probably just trying to add to the trading pool and that thing. But it does seem like, in a way, it's all the same games.

1116
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I mean, yet again, it's Dota and Half-Life and Portal, which you would expect. Of course, the Valve games are going to be involved.

1117
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But they do have Don't Starve and Counter-Strike Global Offensive, so at least there's some other games participating.

1118
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
But I would like to see more third parties kind of get in on this to really give value added to this, because...

1119
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Well, and I didn't really understand how it works either, as far as, like, see, here's the thing.

1120
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I went back to play Portal 2. I was actually just going to play Portal 2, and I noticed I don't have any of my achievements on Portal 2.

1121
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Like, they all disappeared somehow.

1122
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
What?

1123
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Yeah. It's weird.

1124
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:15,000
So I started playing it again, but I haven't gotten any cards or anything, and then today I got a notification saying that I got some new items in my inventory.

1125
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,000
And so now I have three items marked as Steam Trading Card Beta Access.

1126
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And it says, Steam Trade Card Beta Access Extra Copy Grants Early Access to the Steam Trading Cards Beta Game Badges and New Profile.

1127
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Join Steam Trade Carding Group and post your feedback in the discussions area.

1128
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Select Add to My Game Library to Activate, which I tried to do because I didn't see it on my library, and it won't let me do that.

1129
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Well, you need to send one of those to the username. I just private messaged you.

1130
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
So I can check that out.

1131
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I will do that.

1132
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Hooray!

1133
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Alright. What do you think of the whole thing as a concept, though? Let's just assume it works as we read it.

1134
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It's neat. It's more interesting than trophies. I mean, because a lot of times it's like, oh, achievement.

1135
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Yeah, just bring value to that.

1136
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I noticed ActDeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying, you can buy the trading cards through the Steam Community Market.

1137
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
And he says, I sold two extra passes. I got $1.50 for each.

1138
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
It's like selling stuff in the Diablo real money auction house.

1139
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Valve didn't probably take a dollar out of that.

1140
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Sounds interesting. I guess any excuse to go back and play Portal and Half-Life and all that, right?

1141
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Let's move on. DarkSakura.

1142
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Well, this is something that has my hubby super, super excited. In fact, he was practically bouncing in his seat over this.

1143
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Gran Turismo 6 has been announced. And it's going to be, there's a demo going to be out in July.

1144
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The information actually hit, I think, the European Sony news networks not too long ago.

1145
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:04,000
They're saying that it's going to be on the PS3 and that they're basically going to keep it on that system.

1146
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
They don't say anything about it being out for the next gen system.

1147
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,000
They're going to have GT Academy in 2013 as well.

1148
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And that this new version is going to have 1,200 cars, 33 locations, and 71 layouts.

1149
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So that's seven more locations than Gran Turismo 5 had. And it will have the UK Silverstone circuit.

1150
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Hmm.

1151
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:35,000
It says new physics engine, new modeling, all kinds of stuff.

1152
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And I will buy it.

1153
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Did you hear that?

1154
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
No.

1155
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Dan goes, and I will buy it.

1156
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Of course you will.

1157
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
He came in, raised his hands in the air and goes, and I will buy it.

1158
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Well, interesting though that it's not PlayStation 4. I think that's the thing that really shocked people is that,

1159
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:54,000
well, PlayStation 4 has this whole racing club, or what do they call it in that game?

1160
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
The drive club?

1161
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
The drive club or whatever, but yet there's no Gran Turismo.

1162
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
And this is going to be on the PlayStation 3.

1163
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Without the PlayStation 4 being backwards compatible, Gran Turismo 6 is a great reason not to upgrade.

1164
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Yeah, but also put it out this way.

1165
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
If you want to guarantee sales, why not put it out for the system that everyone already has?

1166
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Well, yeah, but that's going to be a problem when the new systems start coming to get people to buy them.

1167
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I don't think so.

1168
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I think that they're going to have maybe some special edition come out later that everyone's going to go,

1169
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
ooh, we need this instead, and meh.

1170
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Gran Turismo 6 HD or something?

1171
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Something like that.

1172
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
WhatupG in our chat says, each of the PlayStation systems have had two main Gran Turismo games,

1173
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
so I expect PlayStation 4 to have Gran Turismo 7 and 8.

1174
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
So maybe there's just a pattern that's trying to not be broken here.

1175
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
That's a good point.

1176
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And actually, they were saying that for Gran Turismo 5, 10 million copies were sold.

1177
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And that it is, the Gran Turismo franchise itself is their most successful franchise ever, especially in Europe.

1178
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
70 million copies over the span of the series.

1179
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Alright.

1180
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Yeah.

1181
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Well, let's travel around.

1182
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I think it's a wise move to put it on PS3.

1183
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I guess, but it's very strange.

1184
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It seems a little bit like cannibalizing PlayStation 4,

1185
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
but I guess they feel there'll still be plenty of people wanting to pick up a PlayStation 4 for Drive Club.

1186
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
So, I don't know.

1187
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
See, I have a feeling that they're going to really push a Gran Turismo 7 for PS4

1188
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:37,000
and make that a big selling point, like around, say, some sort of major holiday or big sales period.

1189
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yeah, but it's just weird to me that Gran Turismo 6 and Drive Club for PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 4

1190
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
are all around the same time, essentially. It's weird.

1191
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000
They're saying that they may release another version on PlayStation 4 later on after launch.

1192
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Of course.

1193
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
See, that's pretty much what I was anticipating.

1194
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Yeah. Alright.

1195
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that'll be coming out a little bit sooner than Gran Turismo 6,

1196
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
as in games that are out this week.

1197
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
And we'll start with Loki in the US.

1198
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
This week, there's actually quite a few things.

1199
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Starting off, Resident Evil Revelations HD is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.

1200
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And then I know the game that everybody's super excited for, Fast and the Furious Showdown,

1201
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
which is being developed by the guys that did the NASCAR games.

1202
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:32,000
That's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii U, and the 3DS.

1203
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:41,000
And then there's the Worms Collection, which is kind of a re-release of some of the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network games.

1204
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
That's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1205
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Also, Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes on the Wii U.

1206
01:14:50,000 --> 01:15:00,000
And on the 3DS, on Friday, actually, we'll be getting Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D.

1207
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
And that's going to be coming out as well.

1208
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And last game this week, Sniper Elite V2 on the Wii U.

1209
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
So hey, there's Wii U games coming out.

1210
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Unfortunately, there are games that have come out a long time ago, like a year ago.

1211
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
So, give or take.

1212
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases that are going to happen over there.

1213
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Starting off with the PlayStation 3 this week on May 23rd, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition.

1214
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,000
BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend, which is getting a price cut that's going into the Best Hits collection.

1215
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Kamen Rider Batteride War in regular and premium editions is out this week from Namco Bandai.

1216
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I would play that.

1217
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Or as they call it over there, Bandai Namco.

1218
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Terraria is getting a Japanese release, believe it or not, and that will be out this week.

1219
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
As well as The Sims 3 Pets, getting a price reduction on PlayStation 3.

1220
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Also on PS3 this week, Z slash X, Zillions of Enemy X, Zetsukai no Crusade.

1221
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Yes, that is Zillions of Enemy X.

1222
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
How many zillions?

1223
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Rob, you just made me sad.

1224
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Why?

1225
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Because that just makes me actually want a zillion game.

1226
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Like on Master System only all updated and new.

1227
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:22,000
On the Xbox 360 this week, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is there as well in a regular and a limited set.

1228
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
That's pretty much all you get on the 360 this week.

1229
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Going to the Vita, BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend also gets a price cut there.

1230
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And Valhalla Knights 3 comes out this week from Marvelous Entertainment over in Japan.

1231
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Checking out the Wii U, yes there is a game.

1232
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
It's Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is out there as well.

1233
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So all the consoles in Japan getting that.

1234
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,000
On the 3DS this week there is a new 3DS XL model, or as they call it the LL.

1235
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:54,000
It's the Shimagami Tensei 4 Limited model because Shimagami Tensei 4 is out this week in Japan.

1236
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
That's going to be a pretty big release.

1237
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I'm sure there's some people going to be importing that one.

1238
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
You can actually get that retail or download.

1239
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
There's a whole accessory set.

1240
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You can get a skin for your 3D.

1241
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
If you're a Shimagami Tensei fan, you're probably importing tons of shit this week from Japan.

1242
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Good luck to your wallet.

1243
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:18,000
If you are not a Shimagami Tensei fan, perhaps Tamagotchi no Doki Doki Dream Omisechi would be of interest to you.

1244
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yes, it's another Tamagotchi game on the 3DS.

1245
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I think you should just get Shimagami Tensei 4 if you're going to import one or the other.

1246
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Just saying.

1247
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Lastly on the PSP, yes they are still making games for the PSP in Japan.

1248
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Zeroji no Kane 2 Cinderella Halloween Wedding in regular and deluxe editions.

1249
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And Rakuen Danshi coming out this week.

1250
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
What is Cinderella Wedding?

1251
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
That is not, I don't think the Disney Cinderella.

1252
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
This looks like one of those games based off an anime.

1253
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Oh god, it looks like one of those romance games.

1254
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Because I see girl and guy in the bar, girl hanging off guy, guy kissing girl and all this stuff.

1255
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
So it must be one of those series.

1256
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Alright, that's it for Japan. Let's travel over to the UK.

1257
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
On the 22nd we have the incredible adventures of Van Helsing.

1258
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Midna stop eating that!

1259
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Sorry, Midna was eating my headphone cable.

1260
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,000
On the 24th we have Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D.

1261
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Dust an Elysian Tail, Fast and the Furious Showdown, Big Whoop, Resident Evil Revelations, and Sniper Elite V2.

1262
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:40,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase TEST.

1263
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Alright, there it is UK. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1264
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Loki.

1265
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Alright, so Nintendo has kind of taken an action against these Let's Play videos on YouTube.

1266
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:05,000
What's going to happen is, partnering I guess with YouTube, they're going to be using their content ID match system

1267
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:18,000
to basically take the ad revenue that these Let's Play videos are getting if they're monetized.

1268
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
And that's all going to be going to Nintendo.

1269
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And then also they're going to be having ads I guess before and after the videos as well.

1270
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I guess it's going to somehow automatically get added in for Nintendo stuff.

1271
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
So that kind of sucks, I guess.

1272
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I know YouTube has policies against the Let's Play stuff, although there's still a ton of it on there.

1273
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And it's kind of confusing because some companies will let you do Let's Plays on their stuff, like Minecraft for example.

1274
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
There's a big thing saying, hey, film whatever you want, do whatever you want.

1275
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
It's cool.

1276
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:07,000
And I know they're not taking the videos down, but the fact that they're kind of like, hey, we're taking all the profits from it.

1277
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
That's kind of like, I almost wish they would just take them down instead.

1278
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
It's kind of a little weird.

1279
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Well, here's the thing.

1280
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
The thing I was most surprised to learn from this whole story is that there's people that make livings off of doing Let's Play videos.

1281
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I had no idea you could make that kind of money on YouTube.

1282
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
And I'm like, wow, I'm in the wrong business.

1283
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Apparently I need to do some sassy Let's Play videos or something.

1284
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Yes, I was joking with Rob saying that, hey, because I do monetize some of the videos I make for YouTube.

1285
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Just for shits and giggles because I know I'm not going to get millions of hits on it.

1286
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But hey, let's see what kind of ad money will rake in from this.

1287
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:54,000
With the few videos that I have, and a few of them have like a thousand views or something, a whopping 26 cents.

1288
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Nice.

1289
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Yeah. I'm retiring.

1290
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Do you think Nintendo is evil for what they did?

1291
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

1292
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I mean, I understand that they're saying, oh, you guys shouldn't be making money off of our content.

1293
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:15,000
But it's less about making money off their content and more of just like, you know, it's commentary and stuff.

1294
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:22,000
You can't really do a Let's Play video or like a commentary on gameplay without showing the gameplay.

1295
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Unless you have some sort of weird like riff tracks thing that you do.

1296
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I've seen a lot of anger directed at Nintendo on the Internet this week over this whole thing.

1297
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And it's like, OK, to some extent, I do get it.

1298
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And I feel I can understand where the YouTube community feels a little bit slighted on this.

1299
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
And I can certainly understand, hey, this is the Internet and we can just pick up and move it to somewhere else.

1300
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
You know, I'm sure there's a lot of that talk going on right now.

1301
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,000
But you guys, Microsoft did this in October of last year.

1302
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:56,000
In fact, I believe it was October 9th was the date the news went out is that Microsoft now they did something a little different.

1303
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:03,000
But they actually put it in their whole little terms of service that you cannot earn money from these games like Halo four and so forth.

1304
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And that if you cannot enroll in a YouTube partner program, if you are playing one of these Microsoft games.

1305
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Here's how that's how I think a lot of gamers forgot about that in their anger, because everybody's like, oh, Nintendo's just doing this because the Wii U sucks and all this stuff.

1306
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
And I'm like, well, Microsoft did the same fucking thing seven months ago. Does that mean the 360 sucks?

1307
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:27,000
But they do this. They're doing this now. And then, of course, we don't know it's confirmed yet.

1308
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But the rumor is they're going to be kind of rolling out the same features that the PlayStation 4 has where you can share videos and content gameplay and stuff.

1309
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,000
If if they have it where you can live stream and do commentary over that stuff.

1310
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:48,000
So you're not going to be able to monetize those videos that you put out there, even though you're I mean, they're making it super easy for you to do that.

1311
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:54,000
They just want you that freely advertise their game without any sort of, you know, that's the thing.

1312
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:02,000
It's like you're kind of advertising their game. It's not like you I mean, you could technically you could spoil, I guess, stuff from the game, but it's not the same as playing a game.

1313
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
It's not like if it was a movie, like you're watching a movie or something like that.

1314
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It's gameplay. There's actual, you know, interaction that's involved in each one of those, you know, experiences could be unique depending on the game, I guess.

1315
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
But I wouldn't say once again, those interactions were designed by Nintendo.

1316
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I got that's the place I saw that argument. You want the word to get out of every game.

1317
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
You want your game to look fun. You wanted to gather the people, whether they're seeing it like on.

1318
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
If I come over and watch someone playing a game, how's that any different than watching it over the Internet?

1319
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I'm not saying I necessarily disagree completely that Nintendo made a bad decision with this.

1320
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:45,000
But I also think there's a lot of gamer entitlement going on here that you guys if it was a movie.

1321
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Do you think I could put up a copy of Star Trek into darkness with my commentary on YouTube and not have that get struck down with probably something a lot worse than the monitor?

1322
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
It would be a copyright strike.

1323
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You know, I think if I were to put something up, you know who's really fucking crazy about their intellectual property is sports.

1324
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
The NBA and the NFL, especially the NFL.

1325
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:13,000
If I were to put up like classic football clips and be talking over them and stuff, they would come after me legally.

1326
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It would be a lot worse than what Nintendo is doing here.

1327
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And I kind of think there's gamer entitlement going on here.

1328
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:26,000
And this is just a rude awakening. And I'm sorry, but I think gamers are getting it a lot better than some of these other.

1329
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Well, Rob, also keep in mind, like for another example, this is the RiffTrax guys have to get licensing.

1330
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Which and they don't even don't they just do their sales that they don't attach?

1331
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Well, they don't have to get licensing.

1332
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:50,000
They only have to get licensing for when they're actually doing like a show, like an actual movie in a theater with the stuff they do is in the public domain now.

1333
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Yeah. But anything else?

1334
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Yeah. Anything else that they do like a RiffTrax for like a Transformers movie or something like that?

1335
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
They don't have to get permission from Paramount to do that.

1336
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
They're just it's an audio track that they make.

1337
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
It doesn't have anything. They're not releasing it with the video on there.

1338
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:18,000
But that's the same thing, though, is you people know the whole reason that you're having this share thing on the PlayStation 4 and stuff is to kind of you want to share those moments with, you know, your friends and stuff like that.

1339
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:26,000
But if you're going to like start, you know, say, OK, we want you to get that footage out there, get that footage out there and then start hammering them down.

1340
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Oh, I'm sorry, but that's not that footage was too long.

1341
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I'm sorry, but you you're trying to make some money off of this.

1342
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:41,000
They're not going to be motivated to continue doing those let's play videos if they make no money off of it, because that's they're doing that.

1343
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
They're trying to put out content. And if you're saying, well, you can't make any money off this.

1344
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I mean, that's basically I mean, that's I know it's a little stretch, but it's almost like saying, you know, we're telling you what you can do, what you can and can't do with this game.

1345
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Like, oh, sorry, you can't sell used. We're telling you what you can and can't do.

1346
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:05,000
In part, that's where I do agree with you, is that this wasn't a smart PR move on Nintendo's part on a time where they need a lot of good news.

1347
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And I think what should happen here, and this is probably a limitation of YouTube, quite honestly, is that maybe there needs to be something where it's a split revenue stream or something like that.

1348
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,000
But Loki, if people are making money, they're making a living off of let's play videos.

1349
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
That tells me what forty thousand dollars a year minimum right to to live off of.

1350
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
You got maybe in some parts of the country, thirty thousand or less. I don't know.

1351
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:32,000
But you're talking multiply that by how many people on on YouTube are doing it for a living.

1352
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Fifty one hundred. But that's that's a it's a big chunk of views.

1353
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
A lot of views required. It's like thousands of views to get like a penny.

1354
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I mean, seriously, I know. In fact, I'm going to look it up right now because I can look at my monetization, see what exactly, you know, I'm bringing in, I guess.

1355
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:02,000
But again, you know, and I'm not dissing the talent of these individuals and their funny, witty stuff and so forth, because that would be kind of biting the hand that, you know, makes up this show here.

1356
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:11,000
But then again, we're not displaying images of the game in motion the whole time during that during the show or whatever. I don't know. I don't know.

1357
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Yeah, but it's stupid, though, that they were also not trying to make a living off.

1358
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Well, here's the problem, too, is they basically say, OK, yeah, we're going to have this partnership program that we're going to partner with, you know, IGN or something like that or, you know, you know, Machinima or something like that.

1359
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And then you have to you have to become an affiliate with them, you know, but they may not let you become an affiliate with them.

1360
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:42,000
So once again, you're given these big guys. How's an indie supposed to shine if, you know, you're just saying, oh, sorry, you can't show any of our gameplay.

1361
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,000
We only want IGN to show our gameplay, find another way to monetize it.

1362
01:27:47,000 --> 01:28:00,000
But how do you do that? I mean, there's I mean, if if I knew I would have the money, I'm saying, though, that if there's another way to monetize it, they're going to still hit you for the same thing, that you're making money off of our videos or off our content.

1363
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
You know, what if it's like PayPal donations or something like that for a Twitch stream or something?

1364
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I'm sure people make money off of that, but I just I don't know.

1365
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I don't think that I think there's going to be a standardized way that people are going to make money off of videos, whether it be monetization via ads or whatever.

1366
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Oh, maybe they can cater those ads for those Nintendo videos to Nintendo products, something like that.

1367
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
That seems to make more sense to me.

1368
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Yeah, I do think, again, I think the smarter thing for Nintendo to do would have been to partner with these people to come to a solution that has both people in mind, either it's split revenue or it's ads that support Nintendo or or whatever it is.

1369
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
But by putting the hammer down, they made themselves look like dicks.

1370
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
But my point is they are well within their legal right to do so.

1371
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And I think people need to give give Nintendo a little bit of a break here is that when you hear about that people are making a living off of this.

1372
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I mean, Nintendo is entitled to some of that money.

1373
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I'm rolling the money. I just made seven more cents.

1374
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I'm at thirty one cents.

1375
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Here's a good example of right here.

1376
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,000
So some of the movie or some of the videos I've been uploading, like different videos and stuff like that.

1377
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:23,000
The one they have the most views on so far is like a how to sideload apps.

1378
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Tutorial, I guess it's only a few minutes long.

1379
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
So I have twenty one or two thousand one hundred seventy views.

1380
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Six hundred or six thousand nine hundred seventy seven minutes.

1381
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Twenty four cents is what it made off of that.

1382
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Wow. So just to give you an idea of how much how many views you have to get millions, millions and millions of views combined over your you know, your channel.

1383
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
So it's going to take a lot of work.

1384
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Just nobody, you know, putting out a let's play video is not going to make a ton of money.

1385
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And they really want that ad money.

1386
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I mean, really, you want that like maybe a buck that they're going to make if they get thousands of views.

1387
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I mean, seriously, it seems a little greedy.

1388
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
All right. Going to a couple more chat comments here and then we got to move on with the show.

1389
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:14,000
But as the show says, the problem is that a lot of people on the Internet feel that they are entitled or have the right to use and access any sort of media freely.

1390
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:20,000
And without having to pay for it, trying to convince people otherwise leads to hate and venom being spewed in many ways.

1391
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:27,000
These people's opinions are so unwavering that no matter what facts you tell them, people will still feel that sense of entitlement.

1392
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Shadow Next Gen says the people who make these videos might take a few hours to make them.

1393
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:38,000
They don't have the right to make money off of the new Zelda title that Nintendo took years and millions of dollars to make.

1394
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Yeah, but look at what kind of money is Nintendo making off their title versus if the amount of effort Nintendo is putting into their title versus the return versus the person that spent like an hour to make a video and his return.

1395
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I think it's fair because you look at the amount of money that they're making.

1396
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's not like the guy that's making the Let's Play videos making more money than Nintendo on these titles.

1397
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I mean, I just don't see where Nintendo is necessarily losing money on this.

1398
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Are they suggesting that people are watching these Let's Plays and going, yep, that's enough of that game, I don't need to buy it now.

1399
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I'm sorry, that's just like saying, oh hey, someone pirated our game, we lost a sale.

1400
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,000
You can't attribute that. There's no data to correlate lost sales.

1401
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Make all the excuses you want, but the fact of the matter is, your system's not selling well because you don't have any games on it.

1402
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:35,000
MM2K says, YouTube just needs to establish a standard fee against revenue of anyone using copyrighted material, maybe 5-10%.

1403
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Again though, I'm with you on that for games, but like movies, I can't post a copy of Star Trek Into Darkness on YouTube and expect that, oh Paramount gets 5-10% because I'm giving my sassy commentary over this movie that just came out.

1404
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
You know? There's got to be something there.

1405
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Here's what needs to happen, and this I think would be fine.

1406
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Nintendo needs to be one of those companies like Mojang with Minecraft saying, hey, you know what?

1407
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:14,000
We're cool with you putting the videos out there and doing whatever, but if you monetize our videos, then maybe that they have Nintendo ads on them or something like that.

1408
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Obviously that's not something that they can control, but hey, if they can go out and seek with this content ID service and somehow monetize or get those videos to have the ad revenue go back to Nintendo, then I'm sure that they have a way to target ads to Nintendo products.

1409
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
And I think that would be fair enough because they're getting their products out there and they're advertised.

1410
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:43,000
The people are more inclined to put out these videos to spread the word about these Nintendo games.

1411
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:53,000
For example, I haven't played New Super Mario Bros. U and I watch some Let's Play videos and I'm like, hey, that looks like a pretty fun game. Maybe I should go buy it.

1412
01:32:53,000 --> 01:33:02,000
If you're going to try to get these people not to put these videos out there, I'm never going to hear about this game.

1413
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:14,000
My final thought on this whole thing is that, you know, again, although Nintendo maybe didn't have the best timing with this sort of move, this is not something that's going to be limited to Nintendo and it is not limited to Nintendo.

1414
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Again, Microsoft did it. Sega did it with the whole Shining Force or something. They were taking this one random game. They were taking down all these videos.

1415
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:34,000
You know, this is still a new media that a lot of companies are exploring and I'm sorry, but if you are just using this to further your Nintendo hate boner, you need to spread the hate around equally.

1416
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Your position needs to be the same for all these companies that are doing it. So that's kind of one of my big things with this.

1417
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,000
If you're going to be mad, be mad at everybody.

1418
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Alright, let's move on and do one more story here before the classic game of the week. And hooray! It's a porn story! Yay!

1419
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Kids like porn.

1420
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Yay! Here it is. Hardcore pornography apparently coming to the next Xbox. At least that's what the headlines all say.

1421
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Here's what it's really about. Sugar DVD. They do films like Hairy Asian Schoolgirl's Masturbate. That's a thing.

1422
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I think that's just a made up title.

1423
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
If it exists, it's on the internet somewhere.

1424
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:30,000
They're going to bring their streaming services to the next Xbox. It's already on Playstation 3. You can get it for $7.95 a month.

1425
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Now I believe this is not something where you exactly download an app and that whole thing. It's just you access it through the web browser.

1426
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
It's just a website that's optimized for the system.

1427
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:51,000
They had the same story come out when the Xbox 360 got Internet Explorer. They're like, we're the first people to have porn on the Xbox.

1428
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:58,000
No, I'm sorry. It had a DVD drive. You were not the first to have porn on the Xbox. That was a streamed video.

1429
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Is there really a porn called Don't Tell My Wife I Ass-Fucked the Babysitter? That's a pretty great parody.

1430
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I think that's Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead. There's a little parody on that.

1431
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
That sounds hilarious.

1432
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I think that's actually a real porn album.

1433
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
There you go. Well, you'll find out on the new Xbox very soon.

1434
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Here's the quote from Sugar DVD's Rebecca Bolen.

1435
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:26,000
The quote, any console would benefit from having unlimited HD adult content at the click of a button.

1436
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Dark Soccer, did you hear that? All you got to do is click your mouse.

1437
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Yay!

1438
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Yes.

1439
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
By the way, Rob, that does exist. I looked it up.

1440
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
It is. Yes. I was going to say, they have a lot of them.

1441
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
My search history is hilarious.

1442
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
What was that one New Year's Eve, it was got to be 2006 or 2007,

1443
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
where we were looking up the pornography on the Nintendo Wii web browser,

1444
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:01,000
and we found the pterodactyl porn, which was a guy in a pterodactyl suit having sex with some girl,

1445
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,000
and it was hilarious. Just the little motions the guy would make.

1446
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,000
And then we were trying to look up, for some reason we were looking up Donkey Punch,

1447
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
and there was a guy dressed up like a donkey.

1448
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
That would actually punch, yeah. Hilarious.

1449
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
When in doubt, more porn stories.

1450
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Alright, let's travel to a time when, you know, a porn game, porn on the console,

1451
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
was Custer's Revenge and Bubble Bath Babes, and Miss Nude World 96.

1452
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
That was porn in gaming.

1453
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,000
It's the classic game of the week, where Dark Soccer is going to walk into her classic gaming vault,

1454
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
and she can do that tonight. She's literally right there.

1455
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I am.

1456
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Find a game that she says, hey, you kids should be playing this game, dammit.

1457
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Now I don't think she picked a porno game, so don't get too excited,

1458
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
but Dark Soccer picked something just as good as a porno.

1459
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
What's the classic game of the week?

1460
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Today's classic game is Hagane, The Final Conflict,

1461
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
which is not a game that came out widespread in America.

1462
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It was one of those blockbuster only games, like Final Fight Guy.

1463
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
And so this is a game I do not own.

1464
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I would love to own it, however, it is $700 on eBay right now.

1465
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Holy moly.

1466
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Yeah, I'm not even joking.

1467
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Let me get to some of the audio from the game here.

1468
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Okay. It came out in 1994, and it's a side-scrolling action game.

1469
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,000
It was developed by Keita Amemiya and Red Entertainment.

1470
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I almost said Redertainment, you know, one of our listeners.

1471
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,000
But it was Red Entertainment. It was published by Hudson Soft for the Super Nintendo.

1472
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,000
And like I said, in the U.S., it was only one of those blockbuster video games.

1473
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Now, I do have the other blockbuster game, Final Fight Guy.

1474
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
That one goes for $300.

1475
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Just saying.

1476
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
So anyway, the story behind this is that the Huma and Koma ninja clans

1477
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:01,000
are basically a big rivalry against each other for the Holy Grail.

1478
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
And the Huma clan is based off of the Chinese zodiac.

1479
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
And you play this one guy who is in full armor.

1480
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
And Dan and I, when Dan was playing, because we have a version of it.

1481
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Quote, version.

1482
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Ambulator.

1483
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Huh?

1484
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Ambulator.

1485
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Yeah.

1486
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Dan was talking about some of the resemblance to Strider.

1487
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I was going to say, you love this game because it's freaking Strider.

1488
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
It's a Strider ripoff.

1489
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I didn't know Dan likes anything Strider or Strider related.

1490
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
It's Strider meets Shinobi, is what I'm looking at here.

1491
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Yeah.

1492
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
And this is actually a game I would...

1493
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I don't even care if it's just the Super Famicom version, which is still like $50 on eBay here.

1494
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I would love to have this game.

1495
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
But the big problem about it is that it's freaking hard.

1496
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Super hard and no save.

1497
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
That's why emulators are awesome.

1498
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Save states.

1499
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:09,000
But basically you're playing as a ninja cyborg who is going to kill all of the Koma Clan.

1500
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Rawr.

1501
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And basically it's just a really, really cool side-scrolling game.

1502
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Very difficult.

1503
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:27,000
But one thing that it did get some less than stellar reviews on was actually its graphics.

1504
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:32,000
It was said not to show off the best of Super Nintendo at the time.

1505
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
So, I don't think Hagane is on Virtual Console.

1506
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
It was sorta...

1507
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:48,000
It wasn't really, I mean, considering it was only released to video stores or whatever, it wasn't really...

1508
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I mean, we haven't seen Final Fight Guy.

1509
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Yeah.

1510
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
So...

1511
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Yeah, this was a very limited release.

1512
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
You could only rent this game at Blockbuster.

1513
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And then, like I said...

1514
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Eric RPG in our chatroom says that they had it at his video store.

1515
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
So it may not have just been Blockbuster, but maybe like video stores in general.

1516
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Well, no, these were actually released only for Blockbuster.

1517
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
If they showed up at other video stores, then they were purchased from Blockbuster.

1518
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Oh, weird. Okay.

1519
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Yeah.

1520
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:23,000
So, because Blockbuster had like a limited release deal just on certain Japanese-only games.

1521
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
So, this was one of them.

1522
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
And honestly, I would love to have this game in my collection.

1523
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
It's really, really difficult.

1524
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
But a very rich, good side-scrolling game.

1525
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,000
And don't say fucking Blockbuster, because Blockbuster is dead, pretty much.

1526
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
The one around the corner from my house is gone. They are vanishing.

1527
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I saw one in a strip mall the other day, and I was like, oh my god, it's a museum.

1528
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Yeah.

1529
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I think that's where I picked up a copy of Parappa 2.

1530
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Okay, so I'm checking on eBay right now. There's one for $295.

1531
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,000
One for a buy it now of $700, and another one without the box for $400.

1532
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Dang.

1533
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Japanese copies, $45.

1534
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:20,000
So, I don't even care. You know me, I have all kinds of imports anyway, so.

1535
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:27,000
But I'm putting up the $700 one in chat just so people can see the cover and everything.

1536
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
All right. Well, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1537
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Hagane for the Super Nintendo. Good luck finding it.

1538
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Yeah, and if you find it, give it to me.

1539
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
As a tip.

1540
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Yeah, because you love me.

1541
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,000
All right, that's going to do it for part A of Orange On Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1542
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
We have plenty more to come, including the FUGL Question of the Week,

1543
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
all about this controversial Nintendo Let's Play topic.

1544
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
More stories about EA and Nintendo.

1545
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:58,000
We're going to talk a little bit about the stuff from the Google press thing this week that has to do with Nintendo.

1546
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,000
A couple E3 stories for you guys, and plenty more, including your phone calls and emails,

1547
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1548
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Watch out, Dark Soccer. Shots fired.

1549
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
What?

1550
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Live.

1551
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 505 in progress.

1552
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Thanks to Redertainment for starting shit here on the second half of our show.

1553
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Appreciate that. If you want to leave a bumper for our show.

1554
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,000
More information available on our forum at the VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com.

1555
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
We're finally getting a few of them in. I have another new one to play next week, so thanks to you guys.

1556
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,000
If you want to use your voice to tell our listeners something,

1557
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
and possibly start a fight with Jamie in the process, go ahead and do so.

1558
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
So there you go.

1559
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
You know what?

1560
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
What?

1561
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Haderson was. There was another game that I played this week that I totally forgot.

1562
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Let's see. Before we get into rapid fire news, there was a couple other things I wanted to bring up.

1563
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
One of them was there was another game that I played this week that I totally forgot to talk about,

1564
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:26,000
and that is Just Dance 4, believe it or not, on Xbox 360, because I think it's on several platforms.

1565
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,000
But Target was having a sale this week on all the Just Dance games for Kinect.

1566
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Twenty bucks.

1567
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
So I picked up Just Dance 4 for twenty bucks.

1568
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I got to say, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.

1569
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
You know I love music games, right?

1570
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:44,000
And I've been very partial to the Dance Central series, and last time I remember playing a Just Dance game.

1571
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Excuse me, a Just Dance game. I wasn't really into it.

1572
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:53,000
But I got to say, I really like, especially in Just Dance 4, well A, the song list is very like, what the fuck?

1573
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Like there's some really, like, you know, they have the stuff you'd expect to hear, like some top 40 hits.

1574
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Like J-Lo on the floor, and Pink, So What.

1575
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,000
But then like there's these picks. They have a cover of the Time Warp.

1576
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
What?

1577
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Yeah, which is hilarious.

1578
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
They have Army of Lovers with Crucified. I don't know if you guys remember that song.

1579
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
You love that song.

1580
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Remember that song?

1581
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Seriously, Google that music video. It is hilarious.

1582
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
That song is in the game.

1583
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Does it have a video?

1584
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
No, it doesn't have the original video. None of them have the original videos.

1585
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,000
But the Army of Lovers videos, all their videos were hilarious.

1586
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
But does it at least have like a hilarious, because you know how they kind of dress up the actors?

1587
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
They are dressed, like the little actors are all dressed up. They are dressed up for that.

1588
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I actually haven't played that song because it's a higher difficulty, and I've been warming up a little more into Just Dance.

1589
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:50,000
But I really like that they have these full workout modes where it'll actually do like a, kind of like a warm up little like, you know, generic electro beat or whatever you pick.

1590
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
And then you'll do a bunch of songs and you do like a cool down.

1591
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
So actually the way it, it's not just a bunch of songs on shuffle counting the calories.

1592
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
That's pretty cool.

1593
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Yeah, that I really liked. So for 20 bucks, I was very happy with that.

1594
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:06,000
So yeah, that was a game I forgot to mention earlier. So there you go.

1595
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I guess we can get into some rapid fire news now if you want.

1596
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Sure. So the, uh, the folks behind the incredible machine, which I sunk a lot of hours into, um, back for one of my first computer games.

1597
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Um, they're making, I love that game by the way. Fantastic.

1598
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:36,000
That's like, uh, what do they call those? The Rube Goldberg machines or whatever, which reminds me, or as everybody knows it, the opening sequence to Pee Wee's Big Adventure with a Mr. T cereal.

1599
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
The little machine that makes them breakfast.

1600
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I pity the fools that don't eat my cereal.

1601
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Remember that?

1602
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Oh no, Mr. Eggman.

1603
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:49,000
All right. Uh, so now they have a new game called Contraption Maker and that's going to be coming out later this year.

1604
01:45:49,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Um, apparently they said it's also going to be mod friendly and, uh, you know, have some way to allow players to build more elaborate puzzles, um, and machines that can air connect with each other and you can be able to share them over the internet.

1605
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Um, that's awesome. So yeah, they'll be coming out.

1606
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Um, probably have to pick that up because I love the incredible machine and, uh, this is also cool.

1607
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Another Kickstarter, a game called Auto Duel and it's a multiplayer car combat game.

1608
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:28,000
So probably, uh, it's a good thing that, uh, David Jeff has signed on, um, to help make this game.

1609
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:35,000
And on top of that, Zach Norman, the creator of Interstate 76 and Vigilante 8.

1610
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Well, at least I think he created Vigilante 8, but Vigilante 8, one of my most favorite car combat games.

1611
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Um, that's a pretty good pedigree right there.

1612
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
So, uh, looking forward to that and how to maybe back that when that comes out.

1613
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Um, yeah, I don't know if they've actually, uh, released or have this out yet as a Kickstarter.

1614
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Probably soon though.

1615
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Um, and last but not least, the Assassin's Creed movie has a date, or at least a time frame.

1616
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:10,000
May 2015. I also saw, was it July 2016, the beginning of the Angry Birds movie.

1617
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,000
By then, I don't think Angry Birds will be a thing anymore, or at least anyone will care.

1618
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I mean, seriously, we can all hope.

1619
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
A long time.

1620
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Alright, before I get to my, uh, rapid fire stories here, I have to, DarkSakura, I see you chatting like crazy in our chat room tonight.

1621
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Did I read that right? You said, had I not romanced Garrus in all 17 times, you've beaten Mass Effect.

1622
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I think it's more than 17. I just made up a number.

1623
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
You might have a problem.

1624
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
No, I don't. Cause I've...

1625
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
17? That's a lot.

1626
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Cause I do different stuff every time, except I always, uh, yeah.

1627
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Because, I'm sorry, all the other romances irritate the shit out of me.

1628
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
No, no, no. I'm not even talking about the Garrus thing.

1629
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:59,000
You've beaten the game 17 times. That's a lot of times to beat a game.

1630
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I don't think, but then again, I've seen the Rocky Horror Picture Show probably 400 times.

1631
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
But I openly admit I have a problem there.

1632
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Keep in mind, I do a lot of character customization, like I played with the gift editor.

1633
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:19,000
So I've probably actually beaten the game a bunch more times than I've done full playthroughs.

1634
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Justify, justify.

1635
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
You know what? Shut up, Rob. Don't judge me, Mr. Abba Collection.

1636
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
You have Bobby Blackwell from the chat room calling for an intervention.

1637
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
It's like I'm walking on sunshine.

1638
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
You know what? I'm gonna go play some Japanese Sonic Adventure.

1639
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Sonic CD. Just to spite Bobby.

1640
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I'll livestream that shit.

1641
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
You have fun with that while I read the news about yet another Kickstarter.

1642
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
This is the world we live in, guys, but this is a really cool band.

1643
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I know a lot of you like these guys.

1644
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Anna Manigucci, the Chiptune artist.

1645
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,000
They have a Kickstarter of their own up for Endless Fantasy.

1646
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And they're very proud of the fact that they've completed this 22-track album over three years

1647
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,000
without any help from a label, to which I say you guys go. That's awesome.

1648
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
And the goal for this, getting the CD out there, $50,000, yeah.

1649
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
They're sitting just under $200,000 right now, so safe to say they've met it.

1650
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Now with 13 days still to go.

1651
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:20,000
So if you pay, I believe, $15,000 or more, you get the CD pre-order of Endless Fantasy

1652
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
and you get the digital download with that.

1653
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
And I know we have some of their tracks and rotation on VoG and great Chiptune artists.

1654
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
So congrats, guys.

1655
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I don't know if this game would make $200,000, but it's sure worth a shot.

1656
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Shaq Fighter is apparently a name that has been trademarked.

1657
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Oh yes, I'm sure you all remember Shaq-Fu, which is what, on Super Nintendo and Genesis, I think, as well?

1658
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Yes, it was the fighting game that starred Shaq.

1659
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
And it's kind of a cult game, but it's one of those games that everybody's like,

1660
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:52,000
oh yeah, I remember Shaq-Fu, and then you actually play it, and you're like, oh yeah, I remember Shaq-Fu.

1661
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Well, there was also Shaq Down, which was a mobile game. They came out with that.

1662
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Well now, apparently, the folks that run the Shaq.com website, which I didn't even know existed until now,

1663
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
they registered a trademark for Shaq Fighter on May 8th.

1664
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
So I don't know if this is yet another mobile game.

1665
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Maybe this is the Wii U's killer app that's gonna get everybody to buy the console.

1666
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Or maybe it's another mobile game.

1667
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Or maybe it's another, like, attempt at a 50-cent Blood in the Sand.

1668
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Shaq goes after terrorists?

1669
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Perhaps, perhaps. I don't know. But hey, Shaq's pretty awesome, so this is gonna be, it's gonna be worth checking out,

1670
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
if nothing else, but for the lolz.

1671
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Wave Forward, who did the game's Adventure Time, hey Ice King, why'd you steal our garbage?

1672
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
And, of course, DuckTaled Remastered, which had everybody screaming like a little girl at PAX East,

1673
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:54,000
is going to be doing another Adventure Time game.

1674
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,000
It's called Adventure Time Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know.

1675
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I love Adventure Time.

1676
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Which is pretty much, you know, any video game ever, right?

1677
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Explore the Dungeon. Why? Because I don't know.

1678
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,000
You will be exploring the secret royal dungeon underneath the Candy Kingdom.

1679
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
And, of course, you can play as Finn, Jake, Marceline, and more.

1680
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:23,000
There will be co-op as well. It's gonna be out Wii U, 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and 3DS.

1681
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,000
I'm actually kind of excited about it because the last game was only 3DS, so it would be, oh, 3DS and DS.

1682
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Also happening, regular show, Mordecai and Rigby in 8-Bit Land on the 3DS.

1683
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
It's Mordecai.

1684
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Mordecai, excuse me, I don't know this show, should I? Is it really funny?

1685
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
It's supposed to be really funny.

1686
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I know Adventure Time, I know that one.

1687
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
If you like Adventure Time, you'd like this show.

1688
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Is it one of those things that's, like, funnier if you've, you know, smoked a certain substance beforehand?

1689
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I think it's just the same type of humor as Adventure Time.

1690
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Okay, then yes.

1691
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Okay, so, um, don't do drugs, kids.

1692
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:02,000
So, anyway, of course I meant smoking a hookah, which is perfectly legal.

1693
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Smoking meat.

1694
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Yes! Or water.

1695
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Let's see.

1696
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Smoking water.

1697
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Like a water bong, that's what I meant.

1698
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Anyhow, so as that name would talk about, the heroes will be transported inside your favorite games.

1699
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
That's pretty much what you'd expect in an episode of regular show, anyway.

1700
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
So, it's 8-Bit Land for the 3DS.

1701
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I guess they already have a game on iOS, which, you know, most things do, but...

1702
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I kind of assume that everything has a game on iOS.

1703
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
There you go.

1704
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
ActDef says, I like the show, lots and lots of 80s references.

1705
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Queen Simi on our chatroom says, regular show is more of a stoner, hipster show.

1706
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Just like I thought, huh? Huh?

1707
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
There you go.

1708
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
You know what I miss?

1709
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
What?

1710
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Now that, you know, we're talking about shows with a lot of references and stuff.

1711
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I miss Code Monkeys, man. That was a good show on G4.

1712
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Like, one of the...

1713
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
One of the few.

1714
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
One of the few.

1715
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Yes.

1716
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1717
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Stuff.

1718
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
You have to guess what it is. I'm just kidding.

1719
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Disney has registered some domains that means that they might be doing some type of racing game.

1720
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:18,000
There's Disney Speedster, Disney Speedsters, Disney Racers, Disney Racing, Disney Kart, Disney Kart Racing, and Disney Karting.

1721
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
They actually have a Disney Speedsters Twitter with no tweets on it yet.

1722
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
So, not surprising. Disney has their fingers in most things.

1723
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Also, there is Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventure.

1724
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:40,000
This is basically... It makes me think a lot of Pac-Land.

1725
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Do you remember?

1726
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:50,000
But, like, on a 3D scale, and it's basically Pac-Man wandering around in a 3D world.

1727
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
It looks neat.

1728
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
It's also based off a new TV show.

1729
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
What?

1730
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Yep.

1731
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
What?

1732
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Now I need to go back and watch 80s Pac-Man cartoons.

1733
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:09,000
And then, last but not least, Google did a tribute to Atari's Breakout by having...

1734
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:17,000
If you type in Atari Breakout into the Google Images search, you will find your screen turned into a Breakout clone.

1735
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Another little Google Easter egg.

1736
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Yep. I actually... I super, super loved what Google did for Saw Bass's birthday.

1737
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Oh yeah, I saw that.

1738
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I was like... I just kept watching it over and over again, and then I had to watch It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.

1739
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Because that man is, like, my hero.

1740
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I'm sad he's dead.

1741
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Can you still play the Pac-Man... I remember the Pac-Man thing they did was legendary.

1742
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Can you still play that?

1743
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I can find out.

1744
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Didn't they leave that up on the internet somewhere, where you can, like, still play that?

1745
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Uh, yes.

1746
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Really?

1747
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Uh, yep. In fact, I will put the link into the chat room.

1748
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I might have to leave the show to go play more Pac-Man. Just kidding.

1749
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Although apparently they're...

1750
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Oh, sorry.

1751
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Apparently they're turning it into the new TV show anyway, so...

1752
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Yeah.

1753
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
But anyway, you can still play that.

1754
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

1755
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
It's not here, Google.

1756
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
And I'm going to read this from Travis H.

1757
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Oh, I didn't even read the damn question, did I? I'm sorry.

1758
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Well, I said it was going to be about the Nintendo Let's Play thing, but let me read to you what I said for the communities.

1759
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Or do you think they were well within their rights to make money off their game images?

1760
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
And I linked to the story that, um, Loki talked about earlier in the show.

1761
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Alright, so now going back to Travis H.'s answer over on Google+,

1762
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
with the majority of the gaming world hating on their new console,

1763
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
and a lead developer from EA coming out last week calling the system crap,

1764
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I feel like the big N needs all the help and gamer love they can get.

1765
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I own a Wii U and a 3DS.

1766
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
In my opinion, Nintendo is failing miserably.

1767
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
They need to focus more on making some damn games for the Wii U

1768
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
and stop bitching about free advertisement and promotion of their games.

1769
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,000
As for the content and spoiler aspect of the videos,

1770
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:56,000
if you don't want to watch the game content spoiled for yourself, here is a novel idea.

1771
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Don't watch. Hashtag Wake Up Nintendo.

1772
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,000
And that is a very similar thing that I've read on many places on the internet this week.

1773
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Do you feel the same way about Microsoft? Just making sure. I'm assuming you do.

1774
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Reading some of the other answers here, I'm going to go to Facebook,

1775
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:18,000
and I'm purposely being a little picky choosy from names I don't see in chat and mailbag and other places,

1776
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
but I do encourage everybody to go read all of the answers.

1777
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

1778
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
I'll read this one. Vince from AKVG Games.

1779
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I'm a person that loves making and watching Let's Plays.

1780
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Somebody that actually does Let's Play videos.

1781
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
I neither disagree or agree with Nintendo.

1782
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Yes, LPs can be a gain or take on sales depending on how a certain game of theirs is handled be,

1783
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
so does reviews and articles.

1784
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Theirs is handled, be it...

1785
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,000
This was typed via mobile, so I'm thinking AutoCorrect really fucked with that sentence there,

1786
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
but I think it's depending on how a certain game of theirs is handled,

1787
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
but so do reviews and articles.

1788
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,000
It's a tough topic, really, because we don't really know if Nintendo is right or wrong with making this decision.

1789
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
I guess for now, if you want to make a living off Nintendo long plays,

1790
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
you'll have to contact Nintendo and work something out with them.

1791
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,000
At least you're still able to do them and not disappear from the internet like other companies do...

1792
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Sega.

1793
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Chiggers asked, what's a Let's Play video?

1794
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Was that tongue in cheek? I'm not sure.

1795
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Going to Zether.

1796
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Zether says, Let's Play videos are not meant to be something to be monetized.

1797
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
They are meant to be playthroughs of games with insightful commentary,

1798
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
or text in the case of screenshot Let's Plays,

1799
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
that the person who did them put their heart and soul into.

1800
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I have followed long plays from both Something Awful, where the concept originated,

1801
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,000
and from users on YouTube who aren't members of Something Awful,

1802
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
people who didn't want to join YouTube for the money,

1803
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:51,000
and they were fun to watch, as opposed to most of the YouTube partners who do game long plays for the cash,

1804
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
like PewDiePie.

1805
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Even people like ChuggaConroy who play Nintendo games are not in it for the money.

1806
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Nintendo is doing the right thing, and frankly, these people deserve what's coming to them.

1807
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
That's a pretty pointed answer.

1808
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Let's see.

1809
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Andy R. says, I don't watch Let's Plays myself, but the news did solely my opinion of Nintendo a bit.

1810
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,000
At least among the couple of people I know who do their own Let's Plays,

1811
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
they're not trying to profit off the content.

1812
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,000
They just want to provide entertainment and to share something they love with others.

1813
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Benjamin H. actually replied to that and said,

1814
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Andy, those LPs can still provide entertainment and share something they love.

1815
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,000
If they're not trying to profit from the Nintendo-based content,

1816
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
are they really going to be majorly affected by Nintendo trying to profit from it?

1817
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Underleveled Video replies and says, I do Let's Plays.

1818
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I only monetize the videos that the publisher of the game has said it's okay to monetize.

1819
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Blizzard, Minecraft, etc.

1820
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
They don't care because they see it as free advertising for them.

1821
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Several indie game developers have gone on record to say if it hadn't been for people playing their game on YouTube,

1822
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
they never would have sold as many copies as they did.

1823
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:05,000
In an ideal world, I think the ad revenue generated should be split between the game developer and the YouTuber,

1824
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
but perfect worlds are impossible in this money-grubbing existence.

1825
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Interesting, because I suggested the same thing earlier.

1826
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Once again, I'm just confused that the amount of money that they're generating per each video is so small that you really think that,

1827
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
I don't know, it just seems kind of, I understand it's your property or whatever,

1828
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:37,000
and you're mad at people making money off of it because they like your property and they want to show people stuff.

1829
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I mean, it's not like they're putting out a DVD or something with your game on it and saying,

1830
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
oh, this is my game. It's just, I don't know.

1831
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Alright, let me finish the comment here from underleveled video because I think the end of it is very interesting.

1832
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:54,000
It really is a gray area, though, in copyright and fair use.

1833
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Nintendo owns the game, but the YouTuber owns their actions in said game as well as their commentary on top of the video.

1834
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I think a court case needs to happen to make legal precedent.

1835
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
That's a scary thought.

1836
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Is it really going to come to that?

1837
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:14,000
It might. Not in Nintendo's case, but maybe another company.

1838
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:23,000
It could be something like, you know, where they use that content ID system and they overreach their balance and ban an account that's made a lot of money on something.

1839
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:28,000
They've done that. Was it Angry Game Nerd or whatever got his channel taken down one time?

1840
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Well, to be fair, again, I just want to be clear, Nintendo is not doing the strike thing against the people.

1841
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,000
They were very clear and they tried to make themselves look like the good guys in the comments saying,

1842
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:46,000
hey, we didn't do what certain other entertainment companies are doing and we're just switching the monetization thing, basically.

1843
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,000
We're not actually doing copyright strikes that will get your channel taken down.

1844
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:56,000
But in the eyes of people who are thinking they're being the big asshole, being less of an asshole doesn't make you not an asshole.

1845
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Yeah, exactly. I mean, I understand that they're doing the thing or whatever, that they're not taking down videos.

1846
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:11,000
But at the same time, they could also be like Minecraft and Blizzard and say, hey, it's cool that you guys show videos of our games.

1847
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:17,000
So, yes, I understand that they can take down games, but the fact that they're taking all the ad revenue from it is still kind of a dick move.

1848
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Alright, I want to read one more here. I think this is a very interesting response.

1849
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:30,000
It's kind of, you know, we've heard a lot of people that are very supportive of what Nintendo's doing and this one is kind of going the other direction that supports the Let's Players a little more.

1850
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
So let me read this. It's from Jeff B.

1851
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:58,000
A quality LP is work, is a part-time job's pay, or enough for one nice dinner at a month.

1852
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Honestly, it doesn't even really matter whether Nintendo was legally or morally justified because it was bad business no matter how you slice it.

1853
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:10,000
And I imagine this problem for Nintendo will diminish quickly as they continue to copyright claim people's LP videos.

1854
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:19,000
When Nintendo started this, they had to have known it'd stop Let's Play videos of their own games getting made by a good chunk of the people putting out quality game content on YouTube.

1855
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:26,000
That's free advertising that Nintendo's own most loyal community does that gets more of their games sold.

1856
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:33,000
If Nintendo wants to nickel and dime, literally nickel and dime in some cases, some of their best community ambassadors, they can go right ahead.

1857
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:38,000
I'm sure they're legally clear to do that, but maybe they should think twice about turning on their own fans.

1858
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I welcome them to come over to Twitch and try the same advertising revenue claim.

1859
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
And honestly, I'm starting to hope Twitch caves.

1860
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:50,000
It means no partners will be streaming newer Nintendo games. More room for League of Legends streams.

1861
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Just kidding, I hate League of Legends.

1862
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Someday, Nintendo will realize that giving people access to your game in nearly any way you can, not taking it away, brings in sales.

1863
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:05,000
And by doing this on YouTube, they are indirectly taking access away because the community will stop showcasing their games.

1864
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:12,000
So, very much saying that, you know, these guys are doing you a favor, and Nintendo, you are, I'm kind of summarizing in my own words,

1865
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Nintendo, you are going to lose a lot of support on this.

1866
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,000
I found the tangent on Twitch interesting, though.

1867
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:27,000
I'm not sure what the point, I have to be honest, I'm not sure what the point was you were trying to make with that.

1868
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Because, does that mean you want Nintendo to go over to Twitch, and you want Twitch to cave on that?

1869
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Oh, I see, because then, no more newer Nintendo games on Twitch.

1870
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:42,000
But, why would you want that to happen, if you hate League of Legends?

1871
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I think it's just saying, you know, it would show them, even if they get rid of YouTube videos of Nintendo games.

1872
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:58,000
And how old are we going here? Are we talking about like, if I have a NES Super Mario Let's Play or something like that, they're going to monetize that?

1873
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Because that right there, they're trying to sell virtual console games, and people don't know what the hell this game is, and they look up a Let's Play video for it,

1874
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
and they're like, hey, that looks kind of cool, I'm going to buy that game.

1875
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Because they don't have demos for those games, even though they really should find a way to do that.

1876
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Hello, I mean, we're 2013, you can't fucking figure out how to make a demo for a game?

1877
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Why aren't you getting people to your website where the YouTube is posted, make money off your website?

1878
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
There's something I'm not...

1879
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Because it's automatic. It's automatic. Because ad revenue is automatic.

1880
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:39,000
That's just like, you know, why put ads on your website? It's the same thing.

1881
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:44,000
What if I have Nintendo content on my website, and I'm making ad revenue through those same ads?

1882
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Literally, it's the same ads that you're getting through, it's all the Google Analytics stuff, so it's kind of a work around, I guess.

1883
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
But, I don't know.

1884
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I honestly think that the money part of it is a smaller factor than them trying to control content.

1885
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Because, I mean, think about it, you've got basically unsolicited advertising coming up, yeah,

1886
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
but it may not be exactly what Nintendo wants to see out there.

1887
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Maybe that is a work around, you know, you make a private video, you have some sort of, in fact, hey, someone could even get on this bandwagon,

1888
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:25,000
they have some sort of service where it creates a webpage for you that you go to to watch this video,

1889
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:30,000
almost like a URL redirector or shortener or something like that,

1890
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:36,000
and look, there's ad content on there through Google Analytics, but you're still making money, but you just don't have an advertisement on the video.

1891
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
There you go.

1892
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:42,000
But then they're going to figure out that that's a work around, and they're going to come down on you anyways.

1893
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Because people don't like loopholes.

1894
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,000
People love loopholes, companies don't.

1895
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:55,000
There's some of the answers, again, because a lot of these were lengthy and I only have a little bit of time,

1896
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I did not want to read all of them, but I encourage you guys to go read them for yourselves.

1897
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, also Google Plus, there was another answer over there.

1898
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Search for Orange Lounge Radio on Google Plus.

1899
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I would give you all the numbers, but you'd forget.

1900
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Alright, let's do a few more news stories.

1901
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,000
And boy, another kick Nintendo story, right, Logie?

1902
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Yes, I love kicking them when they're down.

1903
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,000
No, seriously though, but I've been saying this for months now, that EA has no games for the Wii U.

1904
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Numerous shows have said that.

1905
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:35,000
And yes, it's only been confirmed by EA that yes, they don't have any games coming up for the Wii U.

1906
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:42,000
And I think a lot of that has to do with, they're pushing to do the Frostbite 3 engine for a lot of their games,

1907
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
including, I think, sports games.

1908
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,000
And Frostbite 3 does not work on the Wii U.

1909
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Or basically, they just don't want to make it work on the Wii U because they are developing a new Frostbite engine for mobile.

1910
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:02,000
So, in theory, they could create a Frostbite 2.5 or something like that that runs on Wii U and just have to port it over.

1911
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:06,000
It's just not worth it to them to do that because they're not making any money off of it.

1912
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:12,000
For example, FIFA 14 is not coming to the Wii U because FIFA 13 sales were not very good.

1913
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Although, that's not a really good comparison because FIFA 13 was just FIFA 12 but reskinned with a roster update.

1914
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Literally, that's what it was on the Wii U.

1915
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
So, whatever.

1916
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
But that's the case, I think, with a lot of these companies.

1917
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:30,000
They're not porting their games to the Wii U because it's just not making any sense.

1918
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:36,000
And one of these games that was a big part of E3, their presentation was Ghost Recon Online.

1919
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Still on hold, even though it was supposed to be coming out.

1920
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:43,000
When is it coming out? We haven't heard anything since like a year ago.

1921
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
I don't know.

1922
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Let me ask a question here.

1923
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Is EA still making games for the PlayStation Vita?

1924
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,000
FIFA is the only game that they have for the Vita.

1925
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Everything else is just PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

1926
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
So there is at least something that they're making for the Vita.

1927
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
See, I find that interesting.

1928
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Because I think the Vita is in a very similar boat to the Wii U.

1929
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
It's just a lot of people kind of forgot that the Vita is also struggling.

1930
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
So that tells me there's something else at play here.

1931
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:17,000
I don't think it's necessarily like EA has it out for Nintendo or whatever.

1932
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:23,000
I've also heard the theory about maybe a botched relationship with Origin on Nintendo or whatever.

1933
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Which actually might be part of it.

1934
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:32,000
But I think it's more in general an inability on Nintendo's part to grasp online.

1935
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:38,000
And I think, for one, the online pass system couldn't be implemented on the Nintendo.

1936
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Which was a problem, I think, for EA in some regards.

1937
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Because you don't see it in Mass Effect, in the Mass Effect game.

1938
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Well, you don't see it in Mass Effect, but is it on Assassin's Creed 3?

1939
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Because wouldn't that have Uplay on it?

1940
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Uplay is on Wii U because it's in Zombie U.

1941
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Okay, but there's a whole little separate Uplay channel that you can download and all this stuff on the Wii U as well.

1942
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Why can't there be an Origin channel?

1943
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Why not?

1944
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:10,000
But what I think is, I think there's something about the online store and its inability to do what EA wants.

1945
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:14,000
When it comes to a lot of the DLC, when it comes to the online passes.

1946
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I mean, think about it. None of the Mass Effect 3 DLC ever came to Nintendo.

1947
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,000
None of it. Not the free stuff or the paid stuff.

1948
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Only the stuff that they were able to put on the disc.

1949
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Like the extended cut.

1950
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Did, um...

1951
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Now that I think of it too, did any of the DLC come out for Black Ops 2 on the Wii U?

1952
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
I'm not sure it did.

1953
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
So there's something weird there.

1954
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
And to me, that's the problem.

1955
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
And I don't think it's...

1956
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:47,000
I don't really buy the whole, they can't do it, or it's...

1957
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I think that there's not as much money to be made, not because there's a lower adoption of Wii U's or whatever.

1958
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Because if they're still making games for the Vita, then that's not the only problem.

1959
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
But the Vita, it's very easy to incorporate.

1960
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
You know, it works just like the Playstation 3 with all the DLC.

1961
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:12,000
So I think there's something, I think there's something with that is the real reason why EA is not continuing to put games out there.

1962
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Because it doesn't match their vision of being able to nickel and dime you online.

1963
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:21,000
And possibly whatever is coming after this online pass, maybe Wii U can't do.

1964
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Think I might be onto something? Maybe?

1965
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Maybe.

1966
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,000
But I think it also doesn't help that they don't have that many consoles out there.

1967
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:37,000
And to do a dedicated port for the Wii U, it's just not cost effective for them.

1968
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,000
They're not gonna have...

1969
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
So why are they doing it for the Vita?

1970
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Maybe the FIFA sold a lot more on the Vita than we know.

1971
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Maybe that was a game that is consistently selling on the Vita.

1972
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I don't know. I don't really know what the sales numbers are on the Vita.

1973
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Because it is something that's worldwide.

1974
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:58,000
You know, FIFA is a really big game worldwide, so maybe that happened.

1975
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Or maybe they're just gonna take the easy way out and just take the game from last year.

1976
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:07,000
And once again, you know, just update the roster and just release a really half-assed game.

1977
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
That's true, they might.

1978
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:14,000
So, I guess they could have done that with the Wii U, but I don't know.

1979
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Just release the Wii version?

1980
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Well no, the Wii U version. Just release it again.

1981
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
But just skin it and just update the rosters.

1982
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Very interesting.

1983
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:28,000
So, was that it in your little blog? Oh yeah, there you go.

1984
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:32,000
So, let's move on to some news out of Google this week.

1985
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Google had their whole little, what was it called, the IO conference or something like that.

1986
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,000
And they announced some changes coming to Google Maps.

1987
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:45,000
They talked about some of the hangouts and Google Plus they talked a lot about.

1988
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:51,000
One of the things they talked about on Google Plus is that there will no longer be Google Plus games after June 30th.

1989
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:56,000
In fact, if you actually go to Google Plus games right now, they say they are no longer going to be available after June 30th.

1990
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:03,000
If you want to be able to transfer your game progress or your little microtransactions or whatever from the game,

1991
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
you gotta take that up with the original publisher.

1992
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:14,000
So, that is going away. Possibly to make room for this, it's a game services, it's part of Google Play,

1993
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:21,000
a game service that's going to launch out of the Play Store that will link together mobile, social, and cloud gaming.

1994
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:25,000
And I seem to remember they were showing like a demo that showed one guy playing on the web,

1995
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
one playing on a phone, and one on a tablet or something.

1996
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
They're all linked together.

1997
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:34,000
So, I'm assuming Google Plus games, I mean, let's be real, they probably were not that popular in the first place

1998
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,000
because Google Plus did not catch on the way, you know, Facebook did.

1999
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:41,000
It's popular, it's cultish, but it's not mainstream, right?

2000
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,000
So, the games aren't catching on, so now they got this instead.

2001
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:49,000
They're saying it's going to be different from Apple and what they do with Game Center

2002
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:55,000
because there will be back-end support and this is not going to be just a stand-alone application.

2003
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Anyone making a game with Google Play has access to the developer services.

2004
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Some games will have this incorporated already, like World of Goo, Kingdom Rush, Beach Buggy Blitz, Osmose, and so forth.

2005
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:15,000
It's not mandatory. There's no certification process. Interesting.

2006
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
And it's cross-platform, which is wonderful.

2007
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:27,000
They showed on one of the demos, it was like a tech demo, this racing game where they had all these different tablets and phones and stuff next to each other

2008
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:36,000
and it created a racetrack, like a slot car racing thing, but it was cross-platform, cross-device, and it all worked flawlessly.

2009
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Yeah, so my thought is that they'll probably incorporate this at some point into Google Plus where it's like play the game on the web or something like that, you know?

2010
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:52,000
So, it's just kind of an evolution of that, which sounds a lot cooler than like Facebook games, you know?

2011
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Anything sounds better than Facebook games.

2012
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:00,000
If I get one more fucking invite for Candy Crush Saga, I'm gonna cut somebody.

2013
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Being stabbed in the eye is better than... not really.

2014
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Slightly better than Facebook games.

2015
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

2016
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I've got some stuff. How about Nintendo stuff?

2017
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Basically, Nintendo won an appeal to keep selling the Wii in the US.

2018
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Basically, there was a whole litigation about Motiva, is that how it's pronounced?

2019
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Saying that the Wii had infringed on two of its patents to track body position and body movement,

2020
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:39,000
but the judges agreed that their motive was just to win damages or a settlement, not for licensing.

2021
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:44,000
So, they said no, and Nintendo won.

2022
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:51,000
So, Nintendo can keep selling the Wii, even though they should be trying to get that thing off shelves

2023
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
and try to make people buy Wii U instead, right?

2024
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:59,000
No, I think they should just give up on the Wii U and actually put out a system.

2025
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:04,000
I think it's too early. I don't understand why everybody's like,

2026
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Wii U's dead and it's only been nine months.

2027
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Again, 3DS, same thing.

2028
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:15,000
If we're sitting here after the holidays, still saying the same story, then we can call the Wii U dead,

2029
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
but I'm not ready to say that yet.

2030
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:26,000
I mean, I'm not saying it's dead, but it really is highly underperforming for a Nintendo system.

2031
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:31,000
I mean, you remember how Hyper Everyone was about the Wii, and then the Wii U comes out,

2032
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:34,000
and I'm still finding them no problem, like piles of them.

2033
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,000
The 3DS was a Nintendo system, and it was the same story.

2034
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
It sold better than the Wii U.

2035
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Did it?

2036
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
I think it did.

2037
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
I think it, yeah, it's selling better than the...

2038
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Well, it's definitely selling better than the Wii U right now.

2039
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Well, okay, but...

2040
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Time frame, I'm not sure.

2041
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
The price to get one was also half as much.

2042
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Yeah.

2043
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Less than a Wii U, for sure, so...

2044
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Well, it was $250.

2045
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Well, and think about it this way, too, you know, having a home console is a lot more,

2046
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
I think, of a commitment than having a handheld system.

2047
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:13,000
And with a handheld system, you have the advantage of it being just that, something you can carry around with you.

2048
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:18,000
But I think with the 3DS, too, I mean, look at it this way, they had a gimmick that was interesting.

2049
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:25,000
It was a 3D display without any 3D glasses, and that was like, whoa, that's a neat thing,

2050
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,000
versus the Wii U with, A, it's a tablet controller.

2051
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:36,000
People are used to playing with tablet controllers, or tablets, so that's not, like, it wasn't that big of a new thing,

2052
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:42,000
but 3D graphics without, you know, glasses, that was like, holy crap, even if, you know, no one uses it anymore.

2053
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Well, there's phones that do the same thing, now Dan's old Galaxy did.

2054
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,000
I don't know, I...

2055
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
The lenticular screen?

2056
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I'm just not still willing to say it's dead at this point.

2057
02:17:54,000 --> 02:18:03,000
But I will say, I think one big mistake they made is that they made that touchpad was really a step back to where, you know, touch gaming is at right now.

2058
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Like the whole having to use a stylus, or I mean, I guess you don't have to for some games,

2059
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
but it really should have been as good of a touch, you know, as modern tablets and so forth.

2060
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Because, yeah, people do know a tablet, and they expect it to respond a lot better to touch than Nintendo's tablet does.

2061
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:22,000
For the record, Dan said that his phone that had the lenticular screen was the Thrill.

2062
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Hmm.

2063
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
So it was in his Galaxy.

2064
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,000
It was still kind of neat, though. It gave me the same type of headache the 3DS does.

2065
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:39,000
So are we going to have them release, like, a Wii U with Tablet Plus that's going to have multi-touch on it, and it's going to be an upgrade of what it, you know, like they did with Wii Remote Plus?

2066
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I hope not.

2067
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I still would like to see some more games for the system I have, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's a place we end up next year.

2068
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:54,000
But I think this year is all about, like, this is not a year to release any hardware.

2069
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Maybe that whole Wii Fit thing, which I'm sure is one of the games they're going to be pushing for the holidays,

2070
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:10,000
that is a little bit different because that's an add-on with a very specific purpose, but this is not the year to be pushing hardware for the Wii U or anything in the living room.

2071
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Like, it will really alienate the people that have supported the system.

2072
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Didn't make me happy that the Circle Pad Pro came out either, but at the same time, they didn't, like, what, four games use it?

2073
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:28,000
So, anyway. Alright, let's move on. Loki.

2074
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Alright. So, you know, Ouya. I was joking about this on Bobby's show.

2075
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Ouya is going to be at E3. Well, at E3 in proximity to E3. They're going to be in a parking lot outside of E3. In a van.

2076
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Down by the river?

2077
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:54,000
By the river, yeah. No, actually, they're going to be in the parking lot, and they're going to be, you know, they basically said,

2078
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Everything you need to put on the killer game demo. Ouya console, controllers, and TV.

2079
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:12,000
That's not how you put on a killer game demo. I mean, because, granted, there are a lot of games, I mean, there's games on the Wii U or the Ouya, but not all of them are like,

2080
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Hey, buy me, because this game is on there. I mean, no-

2081
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Although they could show that parking game with no brake.

2082
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Parking game is awesome.

2083
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
No brake parking.

2084
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:31,000
What I want to know is how they're going to fix my controller, because my controller is all fucked up, and apparently the newer consoles that are shipping out have a fixed controller.

2085
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:39,000
So, where do I RMA that bitch, because I want a controller where the analogs fucking work. You know, I think that's expected.

2086
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:47,000
So what if I backed your console, you fucked up on something, and it needs to be fixed. So, that's why I'm concerned.

2087
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Anyways, yeah, if they're going to be there-

2088
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Well, you could go down to the Staples Center and ask.

2089
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
No, I'm not driving down there for that shit.

2090
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
If I go, I'll ask.

2091
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
And they probably won't know either.

2092
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I still don't know if I've been blessed by the E3 Pope or not, so I'm still figuring that whole thing out.

2093
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:07,000
But I will try to stop by. But it should be noted that there are many parking lots around the convention center.

2094
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:15,000
This is likely the same lot that Saints Row the Third used last year, which is across the street from Staples Center, which got even more exposure,

2095
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:20,000
because, hey, it was right during the time when the Lakers were in the playoffs last year when E3 was going on.

2096
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Or was it last year or two years ago? No, it was last year. So, even extra exposure, right?

2097
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Yeah.

2098
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Anyhow.

2099
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Well, Konami talk in E3, or at least a pre-E3 show, and they've been doing this kind of, they've been doing like the Nintendo Direct thing for a little while, too.

2100
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
They do these videos that go out.

2101
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:49,000
So, Konami will be doing a pre-E3 show that will give the latest on some of their franchises on June 6th.

2102
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:56,000
This is the third year that they've done it. Notice how, I think the last time they did it was when Rock Revolution came out.

2103
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Or the last time they did a live presentation, rather. And that was a hot mess.

2104
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,000
So, yeah, now they do these videos that are all pre-done instead.

2105
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:14,000
So, June 6th, 1pm Eastern, which will be streaming live online through Konami's event site, also on GameSpot, also through Xbox Live and the GameSpot app.

2106
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:20,000
New trailers for Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2, which was also seen last year.

2107
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
A year before last, I think.

2108
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:28,000
But also, Metal Gear Solid 5, which I'm sure some people are very excited about. The Phantom Pain.

2109
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Snake is even older.

2110
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Yes, that will be there as well, and I'm sure there will be some other unannounced goodies, too.

2111
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:39,000
And I know we have some long-time Bomani fans who still listen to the show.

2112
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:45,000
I would not go in anticipating anything as far as the Beat games go, but you never know.

2113
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:55,000
If the new Xbox has this Kinect thing built in, maybe they'll try the Rhythm Party thing again, or Dance Masters.

2114
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:00,000
I don't think Dance Masters did very well. But Rhythm Party was just on sale over the weekend. It might still be, actually.

2115
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:06,000
If you don't have Rhythm Party and you like Bomani games, and you have a Kinect, Rhythm Party's not bad.

2116
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,000
The problem is, there's only like five songs in the base game. It's all DLC.

2117
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:16,000
But it's pretty well put together. They should have just made it a disc game with a well-rounded 50 songs. It would have been awesome.

2118
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:21,000
But, anyway. So, I don't know. I wouldn't hold my breath as far as music games go, though.

2119
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:28,000
I don't think you're gonna see BeatMania 2DX or anything. I don't know. Just call it a hunch. I think a lot of that stuff is long gone.

2120
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:35,000
I don't know what the heck they would be putting out then, because they don't really have anything other than Castlevania. That's all I know.

2121
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Pro Evo, I guess, would be another Pro Evo game.

2122
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:41,000
It could be another Silent Hill entry.

2123
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Nah, I don't think so.

2124
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,000
It's about time for one of those, isn't it?

2125
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I don't think there's gonna be one of those this year.

2126
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
You never know.

2127
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Alright. Let's go on to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2128
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:57,000
And DarkSakura dives into the email bag head first.

2129
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:02,000
And tries not to catch anything as she's pulling out your emails to read here on the show.

2130
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
DarkSakura!

2131
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Why don't you read some emails for us?

2132
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Okay. We have three. Three whole emails.

2133
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:18,000
The first one, Dear OLR, A very belated congratulations on your achievement of reaching 500 plus episodes.

2134
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Excuse me.

2135
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Thanks for being there with me on so many long drives to work and back.

2136
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:28,000
I wish that I could join you on live shows more often, but family commitments usually conflict with that.

2137
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:35,000
I have been listening to you since before my son was even born six years ago, who is now old enough to game with me.

2138
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Thank you for making me feel old.

2139
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Right?

2140
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Seriously.

2141
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:47,000
With the new next box being announced this week, I continue to be very excited about gaming even though I miss the days of the arcade.

2142
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Or days gone by of trying to finish games we rented from the local video store.

2143
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Sometimes I feel that gamers today are very jaded considering there is a gamut of options out there on every imaginable platform.

2144
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:02,000
The constant complaints can often be disheartening.

2145
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,000
I agree with that.

2146
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:11,000
I was like, man, we had games that we could only get from Blockbuster that were really hard and had no save function and we liked it.

2147
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Seriously.

2148
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Anywho, this topic is about appreciation and I wanted to show mine to you with a small token.

2149
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Keep up the great work, Dark Charger.

2150
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Well, I'll go ahead and read it because it's kind of long.

2151
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
It's up to you if you want to read the rest of this on the internet.

2152
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:37,000
I'm hoping Dark Soccer since she's unemployed or someone OLR can use this license either for the show or even just to enjoy.

2153
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
You're welcome to keep it or give it away as you please.

2154
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Oh my god.

2155
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
A one year subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud.

2156
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Yeah, I saw that in the email bag earlier this week and I was like, oh boy, Dark Soccer is going to be pretty excited about that.

2157
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,000
I just, I need new underwear, please.

2158
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,000
If she doesn't want it, then I would like to get the new audition.

2159
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
That would be great for podcasts.

2160
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Yeah, but a very, very generous donation and I'm always amazed by the generosity of our listeners.

2161
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Just in being here and participating and even when there's free stuff like this to come out of it and a lot of that stuff will go right back into helping the show and vlog.

2162
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Well, given that I'm doing all of the graphics for the site and everything, yeah, I think I have a use for this.

2163
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,000
So, yeah, very cool.

2164
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Excuse me, I'm actually tearing up a little bit now.

2165
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Are you really?

2166
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Just a little bit.

2167
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Can you cry on air?

2168
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
No, I won't cry on air.

2169
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,000
I cried on air when we got a gift once. Why can't you cry on air?

2170
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
You've cried on air.

2171
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,000
I have cried on air, probably more than once, but anyhow.

2172
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I usually just cry from wank, but this is actually like, oh my god, it's super, super awesome.

2173
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:59,000
So, again, thank you. It's amazing. You really didn't have to. And I know that shit ain't cheap.

2174
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Like, you might have had an in or whatever, but I really hope you did not have to pay a lot of money for that. That's something else.

2175
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Isn't the current CS Suite something like a good $700?

2176
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Well, I know that when I tried to get the student edition for CS6, it was like $300, and I'm still using 5.1.

2177
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:26,000
So, I'm feeling verklempt.

2178
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Are you okay to go to the next one?

2179
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Talk amongst yourselves. I'll give you a topic. No, I'm ready to go on.

2180
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,000
All right.

2181
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:39,000
I'm just a little floored right now, and probably Sinus Medicine has something to do with that, too.

2182
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Okay.

2183
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Dear OLR, after a two-week vacation, I came back to find my Wii U game pad was left on in TV remote controller mode the entire time plus a day, or 360 hours straight.

2184
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:58,000
It responded when I turned it off, and I later started the Wii U to see if I had burn-in on the pad. Nope.

2185
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:05,000
It was plugged in the whole time, or it would have turned itself off. That's a good argument for unplugging it while playing, and that's from Rababa.

2186
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Interesting. That's a long time to leave that thing on.

2187
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:15,000
I thought that thing was only supposed to work for like three hours, but I guess maybe because the remote doesn't really use the transmitter functions.

2188
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
That's crazy.

2189
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Well, he said it was plugged in.

2190
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Oh, it's plugged in. Oh, okay.

2191
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Yeah, but on top of that, though, not having any burn-in is... I'm sorry, I'm still a little floored by the other thing.

2192
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,000
That's all right.

2193
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Not having burn-in is actually pretty amazing.

2194
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:42,000
I remember, of course, this was 19 years ago, earlier than that, having Samurai Shodown 3 and the big screen having burn-in after a week.

2195
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:48,000
I remember the Apple IIe monitors were really susceptible to burn-in. You had to be careful.

2196
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Oh, yeah, you had that little icon in the corner forever that was your computer icon.

2197
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Yeah, it lived there. It never went away.

2198
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:05,000
But that's pretty impressive. That's actually a really good sign of a quality product. Okay, I won't rag on the Wii U that much anymore.

2199
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Yeah, I will.

2200
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Yeah, you will. Don't lie.

2201
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Yeah, you know me. I'm a hater.

2202
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Liars don't get codes for software.

2203
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Okay, so we have one more email, and this person does not give us a name, so I'm just going to say Kirk, which is the first name attached to this.

2204
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Good evening, my OLR peeps. My name is Kirk, and I wanted to email you guys and say that for about six to eight months, I was taking a break from console gaming and listening to gaming podcasts.

2205
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Your show is one of my gaming podcasts I would listen to on a regular basis, and even though I couldn't make it to the livestreams, I've been a loyal listener for many years. Oh, we love you.

2206
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:56,000
But this past year, I decided to be a real adult, which leads me to buying my first home, going back to school to finish my degree, and finally working on those New Year resolutions of losing weight.

2207
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,000
I currently have lost 121 pounds. That's like losing a supermodel.

2208
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
That's crazy.

2209
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Yeah.

2210
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I just want to say, though, with all due respect, I think that's great that you have those priorities, but I don't own a home, I don't have a degree from college, and I'm fat.

2211
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
You are not fat, Rob.

2212
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:20,000
I still feel like an adult, so I'm just saying, you don't have to have those things. I understand the point the listener was trying to make.

2213
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:25,000
You are not fat, Rob. Just saying.

2214
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Okay. With being occupied with all those things along with a full-time job, gaming fell by the wayside, and I've given up my PS3, Xbox 360, 3DS, and listening to gaming podcasts.

2215
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Things have settled down recently this year with me adjusting to my new townhouse, except for the noisy neighbors, and keeping a regular routine with school and gym time.

2216
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
I've gotten back into gaming.

2217
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:56,000
For the first time in my life, I built my own gaming PC piece by piece, and I am now back exclusively as a PC gamer addicted to Steam sales and getting used to WASD.

2218
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Yeah, Steam sales. Superdicting.

2219
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:06,000
With my glorious return to gaming, I'm also happily back to listening to my favorite podcasts, which yours is first on the list.

2220
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Aw.

2221
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:19,000
On My Favorite Hobbies was listening to you while listening to podcasts in the background, and I wanted to say thank you for entertaining me for so many years, and I'm glad to be back as a loyal listener.

2222
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Well, we are glad to have you back.

2223
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Aw, this fat homeless dropout is so happy to have you here.

2224
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
I had to, sorry.

2225
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
You know what?

2226
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:41,000
I get the real point. Sometimes, in order to make change happen in your life, you have to change some things. So, I get the point.

2227
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:52,000
If you have one thing that is becoming so distracting to the point that you can't get anything else done, then yeah, I can understand taking a full step away from it to reorganize.

2228
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Exactly, and that's what sometimes people have to do.

2229
02:31:55,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I've done the same thing myself. I mean, you remember when I went Momo-free for a while, you know, especially since WoW kind of sucked at first. Sorry, sorry, sorry, hate.

2230
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:12,000
But I mean, some people need to do that. It's like people who drink, you know?

2231
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:18,000
You either can cut it out a little bit and you're fine, or you have to cold turkey it and not drink at all.

2232
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Or smoking.

2233
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:25,000
You have to get to your other priorities and stop something that's getting in the way of a productive life.

2234
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Or smoking, Jamie, because some people can do it cold turkey, or some people have to do it cold turkey. Some people need the patch, or a support group, or you know.

2235
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Or you're my uncle and you smoke the electric cigarettes.

2236
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Which, actually, I will go ahead and say this. Nicotine, in and of itself, is as bad for you as caffeine. It's all the other crap in it.

2237
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:57,000
So anyway, but I do, I personally take exception to the real adult thing, but I understand it. You know?

2238
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I'm more giving the emailer a hard time, but I just don't like the perception out there that not having some of those things makes you less successful.

2239
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:11,000
I actually kind of resent the notion a little bit. So, that's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.

2240
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:18,000
But the key was, he didn't say success or whatever. He said something else. But I just, sometimes, society puts these certain things out there.

2241
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:22,000
And I don't regret the decisions I've made. I have a great life. Thanks.

2242
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Yeah, same here. I mean, I'd like to have a job. Not for lack of trying.

2243
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Right.

2244
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:34,000
But at the same time, you know, I think that you can, and I've had to explain this to my mother.

2245
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:40,000
And I always give her a hard time because I was like, how much of my Nintendo did you play when I was 12?

2246
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:53,000
You know, you can be into gaming. You can be into, you know, people years older than me who are still majorly into every new anime that ever comes out.

2247
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:59,000
I'm not as much as I used to be, even though something comes out that I might like, or I like watching the old stuff.

2248
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:07,000
You know, everyone's got their thing. There's nothing wrong with enjoying something and having fun as long as you don't do it to the exception of all else.

2249
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Right.

2250
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:10,000
You know?

2251
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
And I think that's the real point. Yes.

2252
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Exactly. And yeah, I'm not going to go off anymore about that, but I do have to say congratulations to you, Kirk, for your fantastic achievements.

2253
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
I mean, you lost a person.

2254
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:25,000
That's amazing.

2255
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:28,000
A hundred and twenty-one. Dan lost that much.

2256
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Yeah. Extifer from Hoard House lost a whole heck of a lot as well. And I know that took a lot of work and it's very impressive.

2257
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Also, thank you, Fifth Dream, for not making me feel like I'm the oldest person in chat.

2258
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Hearts. That's it, Rob.

2259
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:48,000
That's it for the e-mails. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2260
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Before we get back into some gaming news, it's time for us to get a little ranty with a segment we call the F years of the week.

2261
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
This is fucked up.

2262
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:18,000
I guess the only a few that I have is to this cold that I got from Dan.

2263
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:27,000
But other than that, I'm looking at the Adobe site with tears in my eyes. I'm so happy.

2264
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,000
I'm seriously, like, shaking with joy.

2265
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:38,000
It's like Panto knocked on my door and said we want you to design everything in the world for us.

2266
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Well, that ruins the angsty segment.

2267
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:48,000
F you to that e-mailer for the generous gift for screwing up the FUs. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2268
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Oh, and F you to everyone putting spoilers out about Star Trek Into Darkness because I haven't seen it yet.

2269
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:01,000
And I'm not reading any reviews because they've all been spoilery.

2270
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Alright. Loki.

2271
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:13,000
F you to the, uh, to UEF for their controllers being all sorts of broken. Just the analogs. It's really annoying.

2272
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:21,000
It can be fixed with a software patch, but it's not really fixed. It's just kind of a workaround, I guess.

2273
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,000
It still sucks, though, because I'm trying to play some of these games and it's just like, ugh.

2274
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:28,000
That's it.

2275
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:36,000
My FU of the week goes to, I don't know, things are fairly well, so I don't have a lot of angst.

2276
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:42,000
F you to traffic on the way to the Bay Area because it took me three hours to make a drive that should take an hour and forty-five minutes.

2277
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:51,000
And F you to the Kabuki Theater in San Francisco, although actually it's kind of like the good kind of F you because, like,

2278
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:59,000
I loved seeing that movie there so much because it was in a theater that served booze and they only let twenty-one and up people in there, so no babies!

2279
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:07,000
And the reason why I say F you is now I want to see every movie at that theater in San Francisco and that's not possible.

2280
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:14,000
My movie-going experience bar has been forever changed because of that, so.

2281
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:16,000
The bar has been raised.

2282
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,000
That's right. The bar has been raised.

2283
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Okay, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then we will get to Twitter topics and our Skype line here eventually.

2284
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,000
So let's get to Loki.

2285
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:41,000
So there was an announcement a few months ago about Batman Arkham Origins and, you know, it was revealed that, hey, Batman's not going to be voiced by Kevin Conroy anymore.

2286
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
It's going to be a new person. And there was much bitching.

2287
02:37:44,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Well, thankfully now the deal has been put in place where, yes, Kevin Conroy will be Batman because he is Batman and he will be returning as the voice of Batman in the new game when it comes out in October.

2288
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Also revealed, thanks to an Amazon pre-order, there apparently will be DLC where Deathstroke will be playable in some form.

2289
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Probably like the challenge missions and the other games, but neat.

2290
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:21,000
I'm glad that they have the original voice coming back.

2291
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Now is Mark Hamill actually going to be doing the voice of the Joker again in this game or is it going to be just like...

2292
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
I don't think the Joker's in it. I think that's how they got around it.

2293
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Yeah, but Mark Hamill has officially retired.

2294
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Sure he has.

2295
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,000
No, he actually really has retired. Apparently it was doing a number on his voice.

2296
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Well, so, yeah, Deathstroke would be kind of cool.

2297
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
I don't know.

2298
02:38:52,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Alright. I'm excited about the new game, but I'm a little worried that it's another... I think as a lot of people are, I kind of want to wait and see what the reviews look like or what the footage looks like coming out of E3.

2299
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Is it going to be as good? Is it going to meet that bar that was set by, you know, Arkham City and so forth? Or is it, you know... I don't know. We'll see.

2300
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Well, one more story for you guys and I apologize. It's political, but it is making the rounds on the gaming blogs this week.

2301
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:33,000
And it's a comment from Vice President Joe Biden. Now you might remember that when the whole horrible, horrible thing in the school in Connecticut broke out, Joe Biden started a task force.

2302
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:38,000
He was assigned by President Obama to talk about, you know, how do you curtail gun violence and so forth.

2303
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:50,000
And they did this whole thing about, you know, games and all this. In May, the Vice President met with 20 representatives from face-based organizations to talk about gun control and immigration.

2304
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:54,000
He talked about video games in this as well, according to Politico.

2305
02:39:55,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Franklin Graham, who is the son of Billy Graham, you know, the evangelistic is what you call him, said to the Vice President that, quote,

2306
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:13,000
media and entertainment that portray violence should be subject to a special tax with the proceeds going to help victims and their family.

2307
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:18,000
And this is according to a rabbi, Rabbi Julie Schoenfeld, who was also in that session.

2308
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Biden said, quote, there's no, quote, no restriction on the ability to do that.

2309
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:30,000
There's no legal reason why they couldn't, end quote, do a tax on violent media.

2310
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Going on, the quote says he said they really need a good scientific study, which they've done on things like smoking.

2311
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:44,000
So what's interesting about this is that it's not necessarily limited to games, which I can appreciate for one,

2312
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:51,000
is that, you know, I don't, you know, when they talk about, like, attacks on violent games, then I'm like, well, what about R-rated movies and NC-17 movies?

2313
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:57,000
And what about things on TV and networks? Are they going to put a tax on the nightly news? Because maybe they ought to.

2314
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
You know, because it's pretty violent too.

2315
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
So are they going to tax the Bible because they believe it depicts violence?

2316
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Oh, snap.

2317
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:07,000
That would be hilarious.

2318
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Oh, snap.

2319
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
It's like, oh, hey, you know, thanks, thanks for mentioning that.

2320
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:15,000
And to be fair, just about any religious text.

2321
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Yes. So I think that's just ridiculous. The only way I could see them ever doing that is because we need the tax dollars.

2322
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:32,000
But other than that, I mean, it's just, it's kind of ridiculous. Because once again, you're just taxing things that don't necessarily have a direct correlation with violence.

2323
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:41,000
And again, the problem with this, it all goes back to the root problem with that California law that we spent all this money trying to defend.

2324
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,000
The Supreme Court overturned it because it was all up to somebody's interpretation.

2325
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:49,000
And how can you tax something that has to be interpreted?

2326
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Because, and to be fair to the Vice President, even though I don't necessarily agree with what he said, he did say, we would need a really good scientific study.

2327
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,000
They would have to have facts.

2328
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:01,000
We're going to need to waste more money.

2329
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Yeah. Right. So I, but I just don't think it would be successful because what is violent?

2330
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Somebody would have to set that line and it's too, it's too, what's violent to me might be not necessarily what's violent to you, what's not violent to Franklin Graham or Rabbi Julie Schoenfeld.

2331
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:34,000
And what they're ignoring is that there actually have been scientific studies that have disproven that violent video games are any more, aren't, what's the word I'm trying to think of?

2332
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:46,000
They're just as likely as a movie or watching the news or reading a book. It's the same thing. They're as likely to cause violence as any other portrayal.

2333
02:42:47,000 --> 02:43:00,000
And then what happens to media that's not rated? A lot of movies don't bother getting rated so that they can still come out in theaters without the NC 17 stigma attached to it because the NC 17 rating is a fucking waste.

2334
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Well, and it's not like, you know, watching porn means I'm going to go sleep with the pizza man.

2335
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:17,000
It's just, well, I mean the whole, the whole rating system in itself is, is a really horrible joke in this. I'm not talking about the game ratings. The game ratings are actually better right now than the movie ratings. They really are.

2336
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:28,000
The movie ratings is in need of a serious, serious reorganization. I'm, I mean everything from the fact that you have R rated movies that are like saw level violent.

2337
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Then you have an R rated movie like Romeo and Michelle's high school reunion is an R rated movie because the F word is used more than once by Janine Garofalo's character.

2338
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:45,000
And I put like, I put a movie like Romeo and Michelle next to a movie like saw and I'm like, you know, we got a problem.

2339
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Well, Janine Garofalo is just an R rated actress, so it makes sense.

2340
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Well, then she also turned Scientologist, which just makes me roll my eyes and feel very sad.

2341
02:43:55,000 --> 02:44:05,000
That's her thing. I don't care. That's, that's totally not the point I'm trying to make here is about the movie that it's, it's, it's a joke that a movie like that.

2342
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:16,000
I mean, should kids see it? Not necessarily, but I think, I think a 14 or a 15 year old could see it. It's no worse than there are. It's a movie about high school for fuck sake.

2343
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Like it's nothing different than what they're hearing at school. You know, it's silly.

2344
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:31,000
Interesting. Degenerate Johnny in chat at live.voggenetwork.com says FCC has been quoted to state that the ESRB is the best rating system of all entertainment.

2345
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:38,000
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says Evil Dead, the new one was originally rated NC 17 until they cut a few scenes out.

2346
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:45,000
You know what? I have zero interest in the new Evil Dead. Zero. I've heard things about the movie and I'm just like, no thanks.

2347
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
It does not have the chin.

2348
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:50,000
I don't care. I don't care.

2349
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,000
I can get you legit caught up.

2350
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
No, I really don't care. Thank you.

2351
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:59,000
I kind of want to see it, but it doesn't have Bruce. So what's the point?

2352
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,000
He's in the cameo. See, I know that.

2353
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
I don't care. He's not a Bruce Campbell being in the movie movie.

2354
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:06,000
What kind of cameo does he have?

2355
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,000
I don't remember.

2356
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Does he open the door for somebody?

2357
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,000
I don't know. I don't remember.

2358
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Is he a manager at S-mart?

2359
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:16,000
I don't know and I wouldn't want to spoil it.

2360
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Hey, I don't care. You know what? If the proceeds from this movie go to making an army of darkness 2, I don't care. It exists for a purpose.

2361
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Judge however you want to judge, but I will be there as I am every single year for the showing of showgirls at the Castro theater hosted by drag queens because I live for that shit.

2362
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Oh my god. I need to go again this year because I didn't go last year and I'm sad.

2363
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:46,000
So judge me all you want. I won't go see Evil Dead, but I'll go see showgirls for the 10th time in the theater.

2364
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Now I seriously think that they should kickstart a sequel to that movie.

2365
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Why we're talking about this on OLR, I don't know, but we're almost at the end of the show so we can do this.

2366
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:06,000
They got the girl that played Penny in the movie. If you've seen the movie, Penny was like the other stripper who was kind of like the blonde silly.

2367
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:08,000
The dumb blonde?

2368
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Yeah, the dumb blonde stereotype basically. They actually got her there live at the theater. The Peaches Christ, the drag queen who does this, which by the way that's a great name.

2369
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Actually got her there and part of the reason she was there is that she had self financed or got a little group to finance showgirls to Penny's From Heaven.

2370
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Was the sequel. It's on IMDB and they actually were selling DVDs and they screened the movie earlier in the day.

2371
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:33,000
I need to see that.

2372
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:40,000
I haven't seen it. I'm not going to bother watching it. I thought she was a great sport for going and participating.

2373
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Apparently she is also, there's a showgirls off off Broadway production right now and she actually is in it right now as the character she played in the movie.

2374
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:53,000
This thing is great.

2375
02:46:54,000 --> 02:47:00,000
I just realized I won't talk about Evil Dead but I know the in and outs of showgirls. It's so bad it's good.

2376
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:02,000
It's essentially the same thing.

2377
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:04,000
I can't help myself.

2378
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Rob. Rob. I love it.

2379
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:17,000
I don't like violence and body parts and animal violence. I love titties. I don't think that's such a terrible thing.

2380
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:27,000
And to be fair the sex scene in the pool kind of looked like she was being attacked by a shark. So I mean that's sort of similar to the violence you see in video games.

2381
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Alright.

2382
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,000
I mean seriously who does what she does?

2383
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Alright. Anyhow we get to the show where it's time for

2384
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Why weren't they trying to get her last year because, get Elizabeth Berkley because it was like the 20th anniversary or something?

2385
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:42,000
They were trying to get her but I think she was pregnant.

2386
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Oh. Yeah. Even better.

2387
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Can't show up. Baby on the way.

2388
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Anyway we're about to the end of the show. We're going to get to last minute stories and Twitter topics and the Skype line.

2389
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:59,000
But in order to start getting the Skype calls I got to free up the Skype line which means I got to say bye to Jamie.

2390
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:00,000
So Jamie.

2391
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:04,000
That's okay. I'm lusting over the Adobe suite right now.

2392
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Yeah go install that.

2393
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Oh I'm already installing seven programs right now.

2394
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:13,000
Yeah save the audition license for me because I might want to check that out.

2395
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Guys I'm not downloading it.

2396
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Sorry you had to be here remotely. I know we really like to have everybody here in studio but with no show next week that's a lot of Jamie to be missing.

2397
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
So I'm glad we were able to come up with something else. Feel better.

2398
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:32,000
I actually am starting to feel a lot better. My drugs are doing the trick.

2399
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:36,000
The power of O.L.R. this show heals. Be healed.

2400
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:43,000
I have to tell you that Dan warned me about him being sick in enough time and that we had shared that soda that I started taking precautions.

2401
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
And so I'm not nearly as sick as I might have been.

2402
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
Gotcha. Well I'm glad to hear you're feeling.

2403
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Preventative medicine. It does the job.

2404
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Either that or the Adobe just just miracle cure right there. Must have been.

2405
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:00,000
I'm going to try this news thing and see if it doesn't piss me off as much as Dreamweaver does.

2406
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:06,000
All right. Well Dark Sakura I'll run down the last bits of the show with you here.

2407
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Do you have any final thoughts or do you have any last minute stories for our listeners.

2408
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:16,000
I actually do not. There was one attached to the Sega thing but it's a little bit outdated so I'm not going to bother.

2409
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:20,000
OK. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight.

2410
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:31,000
I am going to Alabama and if any of our listeners in or near the south with transportation would like to drive me around because I won't have a car.

2411
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:33,000
I'll pay for your gas.

2412
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:37,000
You're hitchhiking with O.L.R. listeners Dark Sakura is that what this has come down to?

2413
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Well you remember one of the times I went back like maybe about seven years ago.

2414
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:47,000
I went to Biloxi to a DDR tournament.

2415
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Oh yeah I remember that.

2416
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:53,000
It was a fifth mix machine and they had just gotten a fifth mix and we had had it for like ever.

2417
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:59,000
So I was you know perfect attacking stuff and you know they're like oh what do you think of this.

2418
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Everyone was so nice. I love meeting the arcade folks and I got to go to my old arcade.

2419
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:11,000
So I'm going to try to make it by the cyber station at the former former Bell Air Mall at some point.

2420
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:13,000
You know it's to work there.

2421
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:19,000
We may not be the most popular podcast on the Internet but I really love it because you know what some podcasts out there.

2422
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:24,000
I'm going to ask you for one hundred thousand dollars on Kickstarter to meet stretch goals here at O.L.R.

2423
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:26,000
We just want to bum a ride.

2424
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Yeah I'm going to be staying in Daphne which is an hour out of Mobile and kind of don't want to be in Daphne the whole time while my mom's at work.

2425
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Oh gosh. All right well good luck to you and Pixar didn't happen.

2426
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:41,000
You'll probably just get pictures of oyster shells.

2427
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:45,000
It works for me. All right have a great night Jamie we'll see you back in a couple weeks here on O.L.R.

2428
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Good night everybody hearts hearts hearts.

2429
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:48,000
All right bye bye.

2430
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:54,000
And I'm sure she'll be in chat to say good night to the listeners and so forth and finish out our show in the chat room.

2431
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:58,000
So if you want to stop on by if you happen to be listening live live dot vog network dot com.

2432
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:05,000
But if you want to say hi to dark soccer in the email bag you can always do that as well mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

2433
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Let's get to the last minute stories and I'll start to read the Twitter topics and we will open up the phones at 1 877 game O.L.R.

2434
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:16,000
or username on Skype is orange launch radio. We're already getting calls.

2435
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:21,000
The words had barely escaped my mouth and we're already getting phone calls.

2436
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
So let's go to it. Hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this.

2437
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
What up guys. It's Zeno from the OKC. How you been.

2438
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Hey Zenocore I'm good. How you doing.

2439
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
You know making music here and there. Stuff like that.

2440
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Yeah. I didn't know you were. I didn't. At least I didn't remember you were a music maker. That's awesome.

2441
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Well it's a it's a recent thing I picked up over the past four or five months or so. Oh yeah.

2442
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Yep yep. Got stuff up on SoundCloud dot com slash Zenocore. Check it out when you have availability.

2443
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Awesome plug. What's on your mind tonight.

2444
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:54,000
You guys are discussing the let's play situation. Mm hmm.

2445
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Yeah. Yeah. I still think Nintendo is going a bit overboard although I think it's a bit of an automatic attack just due to the way that their stuff is set up.

2446
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:14,000
They're just but taking the but taking the revenue it's really just putting like giving the guys a noogie on top of taking away their content.

2447
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:29,000
I mean that's the way I look at it. I mean the fact that they're taking all the ad revenue as much of a trickle as it is for a company the size of Nintendo is really it's it's literally like snapping you know just doing that little extra to make a point.

2448
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Yeah but it's not just Nintendo right.

2449
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Well yeah everybody has the luxury of doing it. I have seen other companies do it before but really I mean they'd be better off leaving it as open advertising for the games.

2450
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:53,000
I mean because on top of that the whole sandbox situation does apply. I mean the fact that they gave a product out for play the moment somebody starts playing it is completely different.

2451
02:52:53,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Like you take a video games awesome live their their production for what they do on top of the game is tremendous and they do it not just for games but for releases and everything else too.

2452
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:09,000
If they're if they're going to cut that off they need to cut it off for all media that they do that with.

2453
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:14,000
So nobody is allowed to do anything unless they pay Nintendo some money.

2454
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:18,000
So meaning like like reviews and things or what.

2455
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:28,000
Yeah I mean if they're not if they're not going to treat it underneath fair use then everybody who who openly plays that for longer than five minutes or so needs to pay Nintendo that.

2456
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:38,000
And I don't think like for instance Revision3 their reviews go on for eight or nine granted they're a big name they'd never undercut them but the little guys will step all over.

2457
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Or that I well one thing I was kind of thinking with this is that I'm surprised a lot of people have just said all right we'll just not use YouTube because YouTube could kind of get some of the blame in this too for kind of letting Nintendo or quote unquote letting Nintendo do it or split their videos up into what to say it's five minutes or 459.

2458
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:58,000
It's kind of a pain in the ass.

2459
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:02,000
It's a pain in the ass but you know whatever I mean if that's what needs to be done.

2460
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:06,000
Well that's also going to cut into the then the viewers aren't going to be there either.

2461
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:16,000
And also you have to take into account how many video game tournaments are playing are paying rights because that that that many as far as I saw unless it's sponsored by the video game company themselves.

2462
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:23,000
That means the streams for Team Spooky are also going to be cut out so they can't show any of the video game tournaments as well as Evo coverage.

2463
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Well what about Twitch. I mean there's so much let's play that goes on on Twitch that's almost all that site is is let's play stuff.

2464
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:40,000
But yeah that means going up against Justin TV and if they really want to undercut Justin TV out of that much revenue that they'd have a court case fight there.

2465
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:49,000
I don't think there's an easy answer I kind of think it's going to go back to that guy on our Facebook that said it's going to it's going to take a legal precedent to really figure this out.

2466
02:54:49,000 --> 02:55:00,000
You know and although you know sure it was a dick move on Nintendo's part and I think it would just been a better situation if they've all splitted the money or worked with the content people to try to figure out a solution rather than sick the lawyers on them.

2467
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:06,000
That probably would have been better but again they're not the first to do so and they won't be the last.

2468
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Yep true true.

2469
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Other thoughts Xenocore?

2470
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:12,000
No that's pretty much it man you guys have a good show.

2471
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:18,000
All right thanks for tuning in and lending your perspective one more time for that SoundCloud it's SoundCloud.com slash Xenocore?

2472
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Yeah give it a listen I think you'll like a lot of the stuff on there.

2473
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:22,000
What kind of music? Chiptune? Rock? What is it?

2474
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Yeah it's sponsored by the demo scene that's what I grew up with so it tends to mirror that but it's all over the place.

2475
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:29,000
All right nice I'll give it a listen. All right take care buddy.

2476
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:31,000
See you later.

2477
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:41,000
All right good call 1-877 excuse me yeah 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call. Loki?

2478
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Tryon announced I guess that they've had some layoffs.

2479
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Oh I thought you were going to say something else with this. Tryon also Tryon Worlds announced that Rift is going free to play this past week.

2480
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
I don't know I thought that might have been where you were going with this.

2481
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:09,000
No no no they had layoffs so there was a lot of rumors on they haven't really said how many but it was like 70% 80% of the staff was one of the rumors but I don't think that they said that's that's far exaggerated.

2482
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:13,000
All right let's go to the phones we have another call coming in. Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

2483
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Hey it's Prince Brightstar.

2484
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Prince Brightstar how you doing?

2485
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,000
Pretty good yourself?

2486
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Good you said you were going to listen more often you've made good on that promise so thank you.

2487
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:23,000
I've tried to make it every week since.

2488
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Awesome well what's on your mind tonight?

2489
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:29,000
I've also got a comment about the whole let's play situation as well here.

2490
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:31,000
A lot of people do what's up?

2491
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:41,000
Well I recently started doing a let's play myself particularly with Minecraft and also some of the fantasy star games.

2492
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:48,000
I started this back in December but I have yet to monetize any of my stuff because I have yet to actually get into any of those networks.

2493
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:59,000
But my understanding on the whole situation with Nintendo is they're even monetizing for themselves stuff from the IGN network and game station and such like that.

2494
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:28,000
So I'm wondering if they have actually broken contracts in this and if it's time for the let's player community to actually get together host some sort of charity drive or rather a donation drive which will cover the fees for all this, the lawyer fees and actually take this to court because the laws are just very very out of date at this point to be able to cover something like let's plays.

2495
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
You mean fair use laws need to be reexamined?

2496
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Exactly because Nintendo may also be cutting into reviews and such which are allowed under fair use.

2497
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Well what about some of the things I was saying earlier like you can't do, I can't put an entire movie up and do talking over the movie but if I wanted to do a movie review I could obviously use little bits and pieces which I could still do with a Nintendo game.

2498
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:59,000
But I can't exactly upload that to YouTube where I talk over a movie. I mean why is it different with games?

2499
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:14,000
True and I agree with that and in that situation you can't do it. In fact what most people do currently is they go and sell their tracks sort of on a site like Rift Tracks or something like that.

2500
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:23,000
The problem with video games is they're an interactive medium. So when you're watching a movie it's going to be the same for everybody regardless.

2501
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:35,000
If you're playing a video game your experience is going to be different. Granted I respect Nintendo and any other company for doing what they want to do because it's their game.

2502
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:46,000
But the gameplay itself and any commentary or putting their face on the video or putting their chat on the video as well, that's their property at that point.

2503
02:58:49,000 --> 02:59:03,000
So what do you think as a let's play person yourself, let's say something's got to give here and Nintendo wants a little piece of the pie and a little bit of the revenue. What do you think would be a solution that would make everybody happy?

2504
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:27,000
Honestly I think it's better that this doesn't actually go to court and each company either says you can do whatever you want or cut some sort of fee or say flat out you can't do this and don't post any videos to make it clear as to what you're allowed to do, what you're not allowed to.

2505
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:37,000
And I think it's also up to the community to respect that and not put out videos that the company states they don't want videos out there.

2506
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:50,000
Especially maybe for newer games. Having Let's Play of Bioshock Infinite before the game's actually released when a lot of people want to know what's the ending, that could be detrimental to the game.

2507
02:59:51,000 --> 03:00:12,000
Exactly. Or for in a worst case game like say Aliens Colonial Marines, if all those reviews hadn't come out so quickly and I realize this hurts the community even more but with the reviews and also the embargo that was out, people weren't able to cancel their pre-orders before it was too late on that game.

2508
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:17,000
Good point. Alright well Prince Brightstar, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?

2509
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:19,000
That's it for tonight.

2510
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:20,000
Alright, you take care buddy. Thanks for listening.

2511
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Alright.

2512
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Alright, bye bye. We'll try to squeeze in one more call. 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Other stories, Loki?

2513
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:38,000
They said there's going to be another dashboard update or there's a rumor that another dashboard update is going to come to the Xbox 360 before the next system comes out.

2514
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:40,000
Interesting.

2515
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:45,000
Saying that it's going to update the interface again to make it look more like Windows.

2516
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:51,000
Do you think this could be because of some of the rumors about the set-top boxes that are going to come out really cheap?

2517
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:56,000
I don't know about that but maybe they're just trying to update it so it looks nicer or something. I don't know.

2518
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:58,000
I just hate when they keep changing your face though.

2519
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Let's go to the phones and take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2520
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Hey, this is your opening act for I guess this is the last time I guess. After all the shots fired.

2521
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:16,000
I'll let it slide this one time but you make another Chrono Triggers better than Super Metroid joke and it's over. I'm kidding. It's all good fun. What's up Bobby?

2522
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:24,000
So I just wanted to repeat something that I've actually been repeating and it's one thing that a lot of people don't realize about this whole Nintendo Let's Play thing.

2523
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Just because it's free advertising doesn't mean they have to want it.

2524
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:36,000
And I think that's something that a lot of people, they're like, oh it's free advertising, why wouldn't they want it?

2525
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:41,000
Maybe they don't. Maybe they want to control more of the advertising.

2526
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:50,000
And so the argument of it's free advertising, they should be happy with it. There's free advertising that I've gotten over the past eight years that I haven't wanted.

2527
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:54,000
Ooh, that's a good analogy. That's a really good analogy.

2528
03:01:55,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Is that sometimes people will say something and kind of use your site or your show or something and you're kind of like, I don't know if I would necessarily have said that myself.

2529
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:08,000
Yeah, that's a really good analogy.

2530
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:13,000
So just because it's free advertising doesn't mean they necessarily want it.

2531
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:24,000
The difference between Minecraft, the reason I fully support Notch for his position is because he's not telling a story in Minecraft. He gave an actual sandbox.

2532
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:25,000
Yeah, that's true.

2533
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:32,000
And you're telling your own stories, whereas a Let's Play of Luigi's Mansion, you're telling the Luigi's Mansion story.

2534
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:40,000
Granted, you're going right or left whenever you want to, but you're still telling Nintendo's story.

2535
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Yeah, but you could say that sandbox games, you know, say if I go and just run around in Saints Row the Third and just not necessarily play in the story stuff, but just kill people or do silly stuff, that that should be fair because I'm not telling stories.

2536
03:02:56,000 --> 03:03:01,000
And I agree with you on that, but that's different than playing the Saints Row the Third story.

2537
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:11,000
That's kind of where my line is. Like, yes, screw it around in Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row or Minecraft, absolutely that should be fair use.

2538
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:16,000
Or Machinima is a great example.

2539
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:24,000
Except with Microsoft's game content rules, you have to work out with them if you're going to do Machinima.

2540
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
Microsoft laid the hammer down on that.

2541
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:36,000
Fifth Dream says they don't want Nintendo games associated with loud cursing and stoners. Interesting.

2542
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Well, I don't think that's all of your Let's Play people, but certainly there are some Let's Play people. Hell, we did Mass Effect drunk the other night and maybe BioWare didn't appreciate that. I don't know.

2543
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:56,000
But once again, though, they need to get with it. I mean, sorry that, you know, Microsoft's not saying that they don't want their games associated with, you know, stoners and loud moths and stuff like that.

2544
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:01,000
But they keep saying that they keep like going back and forth with what they want.

2545
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:07,000
We're going to make games that appeal to core gamers and stuff, or we're going to make family games.

2546
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:13,000
Or we're going to make it so that it's more friendly for third parties and now we're going to make first party games and stuff.

2547
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:22,000
I think that they need to figure out what their focus is instead of trying to like, I don't think they know what their focus is almost.

2548
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:28,000
Like they're trying to appeal to people that aren't buying their system or something. I don't really know what it is.

2549
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Yeah. But what a really interesting point is that they may not want the advertising. You know, it just kind of makes me think like, you know, I'm really appreciative that there's many of you out there that put like O-L-R in your usernames or your clan names or O-L-R or V-O-G, you know, for VOG and so forth.

2550
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:56,000
And I think that's really awesome to help spread the word. But you better not be acting like an idiot when you're doing that because then it makes people go, I don't know what this VOG thing is, but what a bunch of assholes, you know, and that's not good.

2551
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
That's not the advertising we want.

2552
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:08,000
I think it's necessarily that, you know, maybe these people are fans of those, you know, those games and so they're excited about that. It's not necessarily like spread advertising.

2553
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:14,000
I mean, because no one needs to advertise Super Mario Brothers. Everyone knows what the fuck Super Mario Brothers is for the most part.

2554
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:22,000
I mean, obviously, you know, we've seen some pictures from Super Mario World and Super Metroid that people don't know, you know, how to play that.

2555
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:32,000
But I'm just saying that for the most part, people are aware of what it is. It's not necessarily free advertising, but it's, I don't know, it's just a unique take on it with the Let's Play stuff.

2556
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Unless you're just straight playing through the game without any sort of commentary on it. It's really hard to say that you're taking anything away from them, I guess. I don't know.

2557
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:53,000
But it's still, yeah, it's free advertising, but Nintendo may not want that advertising and maybe they're okay with the Let's Play community saying we're not going to do Nintendo videos anymore. Maybe that's what they want.

2558
03:05:53,000 --> 03:06:03,000
And so this is, you know, they're kind of doing, oh yeah, we're the good guys. Oh, well, you didn't want to take our offer, so, you know, okay, have fun doing the Microsoft and the Sony stuff.

2559
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:06,000
Well, no, they won't be doing Microsoft either.

2560
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:10,000
Yeah, but Microsoft hasn't gone through with YouTube.

2561
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:17,000
Well, they haven't, but, I mean, they did kind of make the first move in this whole thing a few months ago.

2562
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:33,000
Still, that's even weird, though, that they would, because once again, I would see that as strange if they're going to try to put out these sort of features where they're trying to get people to broadcast on Twitch and broadcast on YouTube and stuff and share all these videos and things.

2563
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:36,000
Oh, but we don't want you to do that. Or at least don't want you to make a living.

2564
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
No, they don't want you to make money doing it.

2565
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:41,000
Well, pardon me, tell me how I should make my money.

2566
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:58,000
Nintendo's not pulling a Sega, Microsoft's not pulling a Sega, but they're just saying you can't, and at least Microsoft has a licensing path so you can make money from it, but it's probably, you wouldn't be able to recoup the licensing costs unless you were machinima.com or Revision3 or one of these larger sites.

2567
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:09,000
Well, what we need to do is we just need to have some sort of reform to this whole, you buy the game, you get the game thing instead of it being a license, because this is where all the bullshit's coming from, is fuckin' licensing software.

2568
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:20,000
It needs to be you own that shit. Not that you can turn around and say, okay, I buy Halo 4, Halo 4 is mine, and I'm gonna sell copies of it and claim that it's, you know, Loki's Halo 4.

2569
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:26,000
Yeah, but that's exactly what you're saying, is that, you know, in order to own it, you have to be able to do that.

2570
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:42,000
I'm sure that we can kind of come to a sort of happy medium where, if it, unless it's about piracy, you know, just straight up piracy that you at least own the stuff that you have, like, you know, I, just because I own a car doesn't mean that I've manufactured those cars.

2571
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:48,000
I can't go and clone my car and expect to get away with it, but that car is mine, I can do whatever the hell I want to it.

2572
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:57,000
Alright, well, no easy answer to this, and I'm sure the conversation will be continuing through the next few weeks, especially when we see what other companies are gonna follow in Nintendo's footsteps, because I bet there'll be at least one.

2573
03:07:57,000 --> 03:08:12,000
But, Bobby, before I let you go, earlier in the show we were talking about some of our predictions for Tuesday's Xbox announcements, and I was kind of curious, since, you know, you are the opening act and everything, as you say, what are your thoughts?

2574
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:33,000
I mostly agree with you guys, they're not gonna, no price, no date. I still think, I do think Xbox Infinity is gonna be the name, I know that they'll give the name, I know that they'll show a couple games, but I think they'll talk more about the entertainment offerings and stuff.

2575
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:46,000
But you gotta realize, this is also being broadcast live on TV, right? So they're probably gonna try to reach everything and leave a lot of the core stuff, maybe, to E3, I don't know.

2576
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:57,000
I do think it's funny, and I mentioned this in chat and I don't think you guys picked up on it, about the Space Poncho thing, they have gone full board with the Twitter handle Xbox Reveal Tent.

2577
03:08:57,000 --> 03:09:13,000
And it's actually an official Microsoft person actually posting as the tent, and it's been tweeting for like the last week as they've been setting things up, so they're actually making the tent that the Reveal's taking place in a character, and fully embracing that.

2578
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:18,000
So that's probably gonna be the Space Poncho of this year, or at least, that's what Microsoft hopes the Space Poncho of this year is gonna be.

2579
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:24,000
You have to understand, you can't force Space Poncho, Space Poncho is just something that happens, it's a natural thing.

2580
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:32,000
You can't just make a viral video, the video has to go viral, it's different. Good point, good point.

2581
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:35,000
So Bobby, you looking forward to checking out Gran Turismo 6 when it comes out?

2582
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:41,000
Did Gran Turismo 5 ever come out? I will get to play Saints Row 4.

2583
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:46,000
Oh yeah, yes, I know you're looking forward to E3, it's only a few weeks away.

2584
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:53,000
I did get my appointment time, it's Wednesday morning, that's when I'll be playing Saints Row 4, they said they're actually gonna have a playable portion.

2585
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:59,000
I hope I'm there with you so I can pick up the phone and actually call Loki after that and hand you the phone.

2586
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:04,000
Yeah, I got to play Saints Row 4 as well, I downloaded The Trouble with Clones expansion as well.

2587
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:09,000
Alright, that's it, we're ending the show. Alright Bobby, any other quick final thoughts before I let you go?

2588
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
Chrono Trigger greater than Super Metroid?

2589
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:14,000
That was a bad final thought and for that I'm hanging up. Goodbye.

2590
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:17,000
That would be an incorrect thought.

2591
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:24,000
Alright, we're gonna close up the Skype line. I'm really sorry, there were a few of you still trying to call that didn't get through.

2592
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:30,000
I'm very sorry but we are running a little over and I have to do some things after the show.

2593
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:36,000
Do remember you can always tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r, you can also email us, mailbag at orangesontrated.com.

2594
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:38,000
That's a great way to get all of your thoughts out.

2595
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:45,000
Let me, speaking of twitter, go to the twitter real quick. Loki, I don't know if you had any other last minute stories real quick here.

2596
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:51,000
Not really, it's just a story that they've already talked about doing this before but they're replacing Microsoft points with real money.

2597
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:59,000
Tigerclaw tweeting us that BlazBlue anime is getting a fall release in Japan. I didn't know they were making an anime about BlazBlue.

2598
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:00,000
That makes sense though.

2599
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:01,000
That's pretty cool.

2600
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:04,000
They're making a game for Guilty Gear so that's pretty cool.

2601
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:06,000
A good way to kind of enhance things.

2602
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:14,000
Misty is sending us some tweets from ASEN because she was at the show and she tweeted us some pictures from Pinkberry.

2603
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:19,000
Thanks for rubbing it in Misty because I wish I could be there right now because that cookies and cream flavor is so good.

2604
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:27,000
But there's that free advertising that maybe Pinkberry doesn't want the advertising we keep giving them on our show.

2605
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:28,000
We should stop that.

2606
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:33,000
Spazinator tweeting us his Facebook fan page for his kitty Anakin.

2607
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
That is a cute cat.

2608
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:41,000
See now I'm looking at cat pics but I like that you set up a whole little Facebook.

2609
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:49,000
Smiling Yoshi tweets us and says, smiling Yoshi wonders if he'll someday be subject to Nintendo's defense of copyrights.

2610
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:52,000
I mean, I'm a Yoshi doll and I'm so darn cute.

2611
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,000
Oh, I remember this account.

2612
03:11:54,000 --> 03:12:00,000
This is a Twitter account that's this little dolly Yoshi that makes all these tweets and it's really cute.

2613
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,000
See, there's smiling Yoshi.

2614
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:03,000
So it's a little doll.

2615
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:06,000
Imagine like a garden gnome that goes everywhere and tweets from all over.

2616
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:07,000
Yeah, I have that doll.

2617
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:08,000
Oh, okay. There you go.

2618
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:12,000
Well, I should say Josh has that doll but we have that doll in the house.

2619
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:18,000
Well, so smiling Yoshi is worried that maybe Nintendo is going to shut down this Twitter account.

2620
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:28,000
I don't think you have anything to worry about because at least, you know, I'm looking at your user icon which is Yoshi kind of setting on your feet or a friend's feet or something like that.

2621
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:36,000
And I'm thinking, you know, that picture is like 5% Yoshi and 95% a body in a room.

2622
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:38,000
So I think you'd be okay.

2623
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:41,000
I think that would actually be okay with fair use laws.

2624
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
Just so you know.

2625
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:48,000
ActDeaf tweeting us, Guilty Gear XRD sign got announced today.

2626
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:50,000
Yeah, that's the game I was talking about.

2627
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:51,000
I didn't know there was a, oh, okay.

2628
03:12:51,000 --> 03:13:06,000
I think it's kind of funny though that name though, you know, XRC sign or XRD sign because it's like all the, you know, games have been like Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus or like, you know, they have like some sort of weird symbol after them.

2629
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:12,000
So it's like XRD, it's like X entry into the series and some random sign.

2630
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:15,000
And lastly, a tweet from Eric RPG.

2631
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:18,000
People often say devs are high when they make game ideas.

2632
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:20,000
Here's one put to practice, maybe.

2633
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:30,000
And he tweets us a link to something over on Destructoid about the game Demon Cheek, like it's chic and it's new.

2634
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:41,000
And I guess this is coming out of the Destructoid podcast where, oh, where they take, oh, they talk about things on the podcast that ought to be turned into video games.

2635
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:45,000
But it looks like somebody actually turned this idea into a video game.

2636
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
What a novel idea.

2637
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:50,000
Do you listen to this show every week, Eric?

2638
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:52,000
Because the same thing happened to us, not that long.

2639
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:55,000
Maybe that's why he tweeted it to us, actually.

2640
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:58,000
If only someone would make a game like, you know, about...

2641
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:01,000
Bungee Ferret talking like we said ought to be a game.

2642
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:04,000
If only that was available on Xbox Live indie games.

2643
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:12,000
But anyway, Demon Cheek is apparently a crossbreed between WarioWare, Earthbound, and the Curse of Monkey Island.

2644
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:14,000
I don't even know how that goes together there.

2645
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:20,000
But I guess if you're a fan of Destructoid's podcast, then there's lots of lolsy in-jokes there for you.

2646
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:22,000
Well, fine.

2647
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:25,000
If Podtoid's gonna get a game, then you know what I want?

2648
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:26,000
You know what I want?

2649
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:28,000
I want two games.

2650
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
One game isn't good enough anymore.

2651
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:36,000
Alright. Anyhow.

2652
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:39,000
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2653
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:41,000
Because that was it for Last Minute Stories, right?

2654
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:43,000
Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show.

2655
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:46,000
If you like our show, remember this is an indie production.

2656
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:49,000
We do do everything here, you know, for free.

2657
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:52,000
We don't really monetize the show like maybe we ought to.

2658
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:55,000
But we do pay out of pocket to do the show.

2659
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:57,000
And you know what? We just love the community.

2660
03:14:57,000 --> 03:15:00,000
We like paying the money to spend time with our friends every week.

2661
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:02,000
All we ask, help us grow our community.

2662
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:04,000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2663
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:06,000
And help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

2664
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:08,000
It helps.

2665
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:10,000
And keep showering dark soccer with gifts.

2666
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:12,000
Because she really likes that too.

2667
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:14,000
And gets her all verklempt.

2668
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:16,000
That was really awesome though.

2669
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:18,000
That was a great idea too.

2670
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:21,000
I love that because it's something that in turn will just help vog in general.

2671
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
So that's awesome.

2672
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000
Anyhow.

2673
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
Before we close up shop, we gotta go around and get final thoughts.

2674
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:29,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2675
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:39,000
My final thought is that I showed quite a bit of self restraint in this digital games mayhem sale on Amazon.

2676
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:42,000
Because I didn't buy a lot of this.

2677
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,000
I buy random weird shit.

2678
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:46,000
But I only bought two things.

2679
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:49,000
I bought, was it the Sam and Max collection.

2680
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
Which is all three seasons of Sam and Max.

2681
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:54,000
So that's like 18 episodes of gaming to play.

2682
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:58,000
And then Scene02 because I didn't have it yet on Steam.

2683
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:00,000
So it'll be pretty good.

2684
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:02,000
And, and, and.

2685
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:06,000
I need people to give me suggestions for game night.

2686
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:09,000
Because otherwise I'm just gonna pick something at random.

2687
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:12,000
It may end up being Call of Duty or something.

2688
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:14,000
Because I can't think of...

2689
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:20,000
Or we'll play Minecraft again and Bobby will show up and it'll be just me and him again.

2690
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:24,000
But no seriously I need some suggestions.

2691
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:27,000
And whether or not you guys want to do Thursday or Friday.

2692
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:30,000
Because Friday might have to start a little bit later in Friday.

2693
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,000
Because Josh usually stays up a little bit later.

2694
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:35,000
Because we try to get him to leap in a little bit later.

2695
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:39,000
But it'll be like 8, 8.30ish.

2696
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:43,000
And I think that way we can play a lot longer.

2697
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:48,000
Because we won't have to worry about work day next day.

2698
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:50,000
For most people.

2699
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:53,000
But yes let me know on the forums what you want to play.

2700
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:56,000
So we can consider that.

2701
03:16:56,000 --> 03:17:00,000
Alright. A couple of final thoughts from me.

2702
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:03,000
I will echo what Bobby Blackwolf in chat is saying.

2703
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:05,000
Some VOG announcements coming on June the 2nd.

2704
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
So stay tuned for that.

2705
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:09,000
Horde House has a big surprise this week.

2706
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
So tune in on Wednesday at 7 o'clock Pacific to hear that.

2707
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
So I guess just plugs from me.

2708
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:15,000
So there you go.

2709
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:18,000
That's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2710
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:20,000
We will be back probably in two weeks.

2711
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:22,000
But stay tuned to our Twitter.

2712
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:24,000
Just in case we're able to pull out a show during Memorial Day weekend.

2713
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:25,000
We'll let you know.

2714
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,000
But otherwise have a great week.

2715
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:30,000
For those of you in the States have a great three day weekend on Memorial Day.

2716
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:32,000
For those of you throughout the rest of the world.

2717
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:34,000
Have a great week whatever you're doing.

2718
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:36,000
And E3 is almost here you guys.

2719
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:38,000
Lots of gaming news coming at you.

2720
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,000
Brace yourselves for this Xbox thing on Tuesday.

2721
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:42,000
It should be interesting.

2722
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:44,000
Have a great week everybody.

2723
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:46,000
And have fun. Bye.

2724
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:49,000
