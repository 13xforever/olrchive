00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:24,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, May 19, 2013, Nintendo makes a controversial move against Let's Play videos, virtual trading cards come to Steam, and a new Gran Turismo game is announced for the PlayStation 3.

2
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:36,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:44,754
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May 19th, 2013, episode number 505 of our show.

4
00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:54,636
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about games and gaming news with all you in our chat and listening on our podcast feed and my co-hosts.

5
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:57,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining us remotely tonight, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:58,117 --> 00:00:58,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

7
00:00:58,597 --> 00:00:59,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, how are you doing?

8
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:01,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a cold.

9
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to hear it.

10
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,081
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd you get that?

11
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:04,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan.

12
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:07,807
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, I just have allergies.

13
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:08,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's share a soda.

14
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops, sorry, it was cold.

15
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:14,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought maybe he might have got something at that whole Pentagogo thing.

16
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:15,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you go to that?

17
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:16,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was this weekend?

18
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:17,582
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

19
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:37,377
[SPEAKER_04]: There ain't shit in Dixon either.

20
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a weird place for Pinagogo.

21
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,180
[SPEAKER_07]: There's stuff in Dixon.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,763
[SPEAKER_07]: There's pollen and a really good ice cream parlor.

23
00:01:43,143 --> 00:01:45,105
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even have a 24-hour Starbucks anymore.

24
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:48,228
[SPEAKER_07]: But they do have a Mary's Pizza shack.

25
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:48,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they do.

26
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,131
[SPEAKER_04]: And they do have Pinagogo, which is pretty awesome.

27
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently this year was supposed to be totally bombed.

28
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,516
[SPEAKER_07]: They had every spot filled.

29
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:58,239
[SPEAKER_07]: They couldn't take any more people in because of power usage.

30
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:08,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I really wanted to go because they had all kinds of prototype machines and they had the new X-Men table and all kinds of stuff.

31
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:14,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I really wanted to go, but Dan was sick and I wasn't going to go without him because I have no other reason to go to Dixon.

32
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Who can blame you?

33
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:20,443
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll also say hello to, here in studio, Techmaster Loki.

34
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:20,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

35
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:22,203
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Techmaster Loki?

36
00:02:22,423 --> 00:02:23,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine.

37
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm organizing Steam games.

38
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:28,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what was this you were trying to figure out?

39
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:38,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one of our listeners knows because we do have the live chat room at live.vognetwork.com when we are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

40
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:39,764
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have the chatters joining us.

41
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:41,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one of them knows the answer to your question.

42
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:47,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was just wondering if there's a way to... Oh, I guess there's different categories and stuff you could say.

43
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:51,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Just seeing if there's a way to, like, you know... Oh, okay, here we go.

44
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Categories.

45
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,831
[SPEAKER_05]: You can add categories to the games.

46
00:02:54,031 --> 00:03:00,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the folder sort some of the games I have, because I have now over 100 games.

47
00:03:00,674 --> 00:03:01,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Amazon.

48
00:03:03,235 --> 00:03:04,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have a crazy sale recently or something?

49
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:07,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's still going until the end of the month.

50
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:12,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It's their mega sale or something.

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,602
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole bunch of games and bundles and stuff.

52
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:16,963
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some really good Sonic bundles.

53
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:23,206
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like Sonic the Hedgehog, you can get almost all the games that they have on PC, including the Genesis stuff, for like $20.

54
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:26,549
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a Steam sale, but it's on Amazon.

55
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:27,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually, that's the thing.

56
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:35,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been finding a lot of these sales on Steam games on other sites, like Green Man Gaming or Amazon.

57
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:43,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazon, for a lot of the stuff, even Gamefly has stuff, and it's all redeemable on Steam or Origin.

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,363
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually have some games on Origin that I really wanted, but I am not installing Origin.

59
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:48,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't blame you, sir.

60
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:49,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm passing on it.

61
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:50,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Battlefield 3 was $10 on Steam.

62
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:53,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wanted Battlefield 3.

63
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:57,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I had to sell my soul to play Mass Effect 3 online on the PC.

64
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really wanted Command & Conquer.

65
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:04,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, I wanted Red Alert 3 because I forgot all about it.

66
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:07,518
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went back and I started playing some of the older games.

67
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:14,163
[SPEAKER_05]: But I saw in the trailer for it that they have George the K's in it.

68
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim Curry is in it.

70
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:19,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Tim Curry is in it.

71
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:23,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And they even have... Oh, who the hell is it?

72
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:26,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see her face and I can't think of her name.

73
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:28,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny McCarthy is in it.

74
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:29,399
[SPEAKER_05]: She plays Tanya.

75
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:30,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Random.

76
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:32,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she plays like the assassin chick.

77
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:35,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's so awesome and just...

78
00:04:35,946 --> 00:05:02,343
[SPEAKER_05]: and because they went back in the second game I don't know if they had the full motion video cutscenes but they went back to the way that the first game was where they had full motion video cutscenes and it's just awesome but it also has origin and I'm not I'm not doing that so I'm sorry going to the chat room at live.vognetwork.com Actdeft says you can sort your games in your Steam library so you can at least sort them differently

79
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:05,814
[SPEAKER_05]: XBOX 720, XBOX INFINITY

80
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,200
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

81
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:52,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just talk.

82
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki will do the one-man show.

83
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't you do that one year?

84
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:56,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it a couple times.

85
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those shows are really interesting, you guys.

86
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:02,581
[SPEAKER_07]: You can discuss pizza and bacon.

87
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:04,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I might.

88
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,927
[SPEAKER_05]: If I've got stuff to talk about, it's not so bad.

89
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:08,730
[SPEAKER_05]: But trying to stretch like, you know...

90
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:38,210
[SPEAKER_04]: it's more fun when it's live and we have the chatters for that kind of instant feedback too even when we're wrong I can team up with Bobby I guess there you go you can team up with Bobby but I don't think Bobby's looking for a partner that would be hilarious but he's my only friend on multiple gaming services alright let's talk about final predictions for the new Xbox I guess I will start with our resident loud mouth Loki and I say that with love

91
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:43,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll tell you, I'll just start with what we're not going to see.

92
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:46,410
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to see a date other than holiday.

93
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,652
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to see a price.

94
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:53,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not going to hear anything about DRM, so you can just forget about that.

95
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:57,302
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to have to come with press asking follow-up questions, that kind of stuff.

96
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:59,325
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to say, oh, by the way, use games.

97
00:06:59,385 --> 00:06:59,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

98
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:02,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they're even going to do that.

99
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:04,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, that's going to be really weird.

100
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:08,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Although there are some stories that make me wonder if there is something coming.

101
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,932
[SPEAKER_05]: But once again, everybody has to be on board.

102
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:12,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just them.

103
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:16,176
[SPEAKER_05]: All platforms have to be on board with it in order for it to work.

104
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:17,477
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not going to happen.

105
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:24,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know what we're going to really see as far as new games.

106
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:24,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

107
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:29,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Specs, they're going to show us specs.

108
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,691
[SPEAKER_05]: They may show us a box.

109
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:35,494
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think about it, how hard would it be for them to mock up something?

110
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:37,095
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to be exactly like that.

111
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:40,477
[SPEAKER_05]: It can change once it goes to retail, but they can mock up something.

112
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:44,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Just have it there so that people can not bitch about it.

113
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And things do change before retail.

114
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:48,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

115
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about the PlayStation 3 boomerang.

116
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, the PlayStation 3.

117
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:56,268
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be 1080p, 120 frames per second.

118
00:07:57,489 --> 00:08:00,031
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have 20 USB ports in the back.

119
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:05,054
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have a million USB ports and three HDMI ports or something.

120
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,355
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you even need that for?

121
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:10,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you want to, like... A daisy chain.

122
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:15,960
[SPEAKER_05]: HDMI in, HDMI audio to your receiver, and HDMI to your TV.

123
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

124
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,921
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't know.

125
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,282
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll probably just talk specs.

126
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:29,406
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll talk about, you know, I think they're going to focus a lot on, like, the entertainment stuff, you know, with the whole, you know, taking over your TV, being an entertainment hub.

127
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:31,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope there's something cool.

128
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:37,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to see connect, connect, connect, connect, connect.

129
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,348
[SPEAKER_04]: With the new video game console, you want to say something cool?

130
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:41,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

131
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:42,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It's shocking.

132
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:45,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say, though, I am going to get a new video game console this year.

133
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to buy one of those at launch.

134
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:53,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either going to be the PlayStation 4 or the... My money's on Wii U. For you, Loki.

135
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,970
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

136
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,771
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

137
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:57,071
[SPEAKER_04]: There could be a price cut at E3.

138
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:58,685
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

139
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:31,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually going to second a lot of what Loki said, just because I'm sure we're not going to get a specific date, we're not going to get a specific price point.

140
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,003
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get a name, we'll get a few screen captures of video games that are actually PC screen captures.

141
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:46,968
[SPEAKER_07]: More about it being for entertainment, the multiple use, you get pictures of actor families together looking happy and waving their hands around looking stupid.

142
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:49,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid and happy, stupid and happy people.

143
00:09:50,150 --> 00:10:10,136
[SPEAKER_07]: um you know the name confirmation just the you I mean I've seen so many Sega announcements and they've been the same I'm not saying what am I saying Sega um Xbox announcements and they've been the same type of thing every year I think it's just going to be their usual pattern I'm not going to be surprised by anything

144
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:11,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Cirque du Soleil this year?

145
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:12,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Space ponchos?

146
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:13,859
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

147
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing was that the... Information-wise.

148
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:21,162
[SPEAKER_05]: The actual tent is the space poncho.

149
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,843
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you're in the space poncho.

150
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:24,304
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like meta space poncho.

151
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anything else, DarkSakura?

152
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:28,605
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it should be.

153
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:33,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you guys like the hashtag so much, we now present the Xbox space poncho.

154
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:36,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'll have a...

155
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,166
[SPEAKER_07]: EA humping them in the background and it won't sell in Japan.

156
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:48,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to say about that, DarkSakura?

157
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:51,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

158
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:54,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments on Loki's possible solo podcast next week.

159
00:10:54,837 --> 00:11:00,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Alchemy in chat says, Loki's totally rational and not loud Nintendo critique and discussion hour.

160
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:07,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I am 100% rational, and I am only, I critique because I love.

161
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,857
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says, Loki's Bacon Pizza Podcast, where do I subscribe?

162
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,428
[SPEAKER_04]: at the hospital when you guys all have heart attacks.

163
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:19,189
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you subscribe.

164
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:20,769
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not going to happen.

165
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,650
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn.

166
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,291
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do I predict for Tuesday?

167
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:25,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely you're going to have the name.

168
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:26,632
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.

169
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:30,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, we can stop calling it the 720 and we'll know the real name.

170
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:32,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it is the 720, which would be hilarious.

171
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:33,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Please no.

172
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:35,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, Microsoft, no.

173
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,677
[SPEAKER_04]: We've spun around twice.

174
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:38,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I still vote for the lube.

175
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:40,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the name Xbox Salub.

176
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Infinity seems probable, but I do think that's more internet wank.

177
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just simply something you haven't heard.

178
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:49,121
[SPEAKER_04]: My money is on Fusion.

179
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:51,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Fusion.

180
00:11:53,482 --> 00:12:02,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you will get... I think they are going to one-up what Sony did, and I think they will show you what it looks like, even though it is, of course, subject to change.

181
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:05,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely not on the date.

182
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely not on the price.

183
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:07,426
[SPEAKER_04]: That will be E3.

184
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:22,973
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think one thing y'all need to be prepared is that there's not going to be a lot of games shown because they've already pretty much come out and said E3 is all about the games and I think that's a really risky move on Microsoft's part because I can just see the Twitter snark now

185
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:24,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are the games?

186
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:29,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they did say they're going to show the Call of Duty Ghost thing.

187
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:34,701
[SPEAKER_04]: That will be shown, but that's one game, and that's a game we already kind of knew was coming.

188
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:37,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you're going to see any bang up.

189
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:37,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

190
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Rumor Wankville.

191
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:42,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the wankiest of wanks.

192
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:42,686
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?

193
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:47,189
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a new Killer Instinct game on this Xbox, you ain't seeing it tomorrow.

194
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:49,170
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be an E3 surprise.

195
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,291
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the end of the E3 presentation.

196
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:55,253
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're going to pull out that kind of wank, that's when that's coming.

197
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:58,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see him do something like that and then just drop the mic at the end.

198
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:00,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Just drop the mic and walk off the stage.

199
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, done.

200
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:03,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just fire a gun.

201
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:05,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Shots fired, Sony.

202
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:06,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Bam.

203
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:06,899
[SPEAKER_04]: We're out.

204
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:35,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be a lot I think it's a lot about trying to get the tech world kind of buzzed up a little bit and I think you're going to see much more on the if it's true that they want to replace your cable box which I think could be a likely thing I think we're going to see a lot more about that and definitely interaction between Windows 8

205
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:51,972
[SPEAKER_04]: and how you can interact with things on your PC and how the PC will work as you know pretty much what you've already seen with Windows Media Center but I think they're going to kind of bump it up a little bit and Windows Phone because you know it's all about the synergy between all those different Microsoft phones.

206
00:13:52,392 --> 00:14:04,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be all tablets and you know iOS and they come on they know that they're limiting themselves they're not no one is going to buy a Windows Phone for the next Xbox.

207
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,441
[SPEAKER_04]: But any of that stuff?

208
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:10,042
[SPEAKER_04]: The snark in you ought to be asking, will Microsoft let it last more than a year?

209
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it going to be the next game room?

210
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:13,542
[SPEAKER_04]: The next smart glass?

211
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:15,483
[SPEAKER_04]: The next HD DVD drive?

212
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Or on top of that, is half the stuff they're even going to show actually going to be possible?

213
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:24,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, hey, I'm scanning the bottom of my skateboard to bring the artwork into the game.

214
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:28,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Versus, hey, I'm scanning my pictures so that I can get a color for my car.

215
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:32,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And it always looks pink because the lighting in my room sucks.

216
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you will see some games.

217
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:36,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a limited amount.

218
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be a lot of what we already know about.

219
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe like a teaser reel of Stay Tuned E3 for more on this.

220
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:48,695
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like a full motion video that will make no sense at the very end.

221
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:50,756
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, you want to see what this is?

222
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:51,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned for E3.

223
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:53,858
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it'll end or something like that.

224
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:56,499
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll end with Square Enix coming out.

225
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,061
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have... We would like to announce...

226
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:01,942
[SPEAKER_05]: A game that we're going to announce at E3.

227
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:03,162
[SPEAKER_05]: See ya.

228
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:15,246
[SPEAKER_04]: EA will walk out on stage and go, we are going to give our full support to the next... We believe the next Xbox is the future of gaming and we are going to partner up with the... And we'll be all sitting here going...

229
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:17,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we hear this before a couple years ago?

230
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you are correct.

231
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:20,609
[SPEAKER_05]: They will be out there.

232
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:31,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think that they're actually going to be in the presentation because one of the rumors was supposed to be that Titan game from the ex-Infinity Ward guys, their new company.

233
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the actual Titan game.

234
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:34,717
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the actual Titan game.

235
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:40,540
[SPEAKER_04]: When you say Titan, my mind goes to Horde House, Blizzard, and all that, and I think of the Project Titan that Blizzard's doing.

236
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:42,041
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it's not that.

237
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:42,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

238
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:53,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we can all agree, though, that no matter what Microsoft says, there is going to be a shitstorm on the internet immediately following.

239
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:57,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, which is really interesting because I'm actually going to be out of town.

240
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to be able to watch it live or participate in the snark on Twitter.

241
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:02,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to watch it live and I'll participate in the snark.

242
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:03,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you will.

243
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,301
[SPEAKER_07]: You should live blog it for us.

244
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:08,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And I already have my popcorn, so I'm all ready.

245
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:14,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little sad I'm going to be having to watch it late, but I'm going to be up in Reno.

246
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:16,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not getting up at 10 a.m.

247
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:17,835
[SPEAKER_04]: to watch this crap.

248
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:19,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be busy.

249
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:27,921
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll have to kind of wait and see it later and have to go rewind the snark over on Twitter.

250
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:30,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we'll see what happens.

251
00:16:31,163 --> 00:16:37,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and I'm kind of curious what you guys think is going to happen.

252
00:16:37,386 --> 00:16:41,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, I'm betting on Xbox Power 3 or X-Cube.

253
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:44,291
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a little too close to GameCube.

254
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadow Next Gen says Xbox Infinity makes sense.

255
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:50,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn the Infinity symbol right side up and what do you get?

256
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:52,859
[SPEAKER_04]: The number 8, which can tie into Windows 8.

257
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:05,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my whole kind of like, hmm, with that though is that we had that news, was it this week or last week, that they're going to move on to Windows 8.1, which is that Windows Blue they've been talking about, which is going to be a free upgrade for Windows 8.

258
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:07,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically like...

259
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:09,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they should call it the Texaract

260
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:37,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

261
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:47,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a Tesseract is a fourth-dimensional cube, since they would have, if you were going by box to cube, the next step up would be a Tesseract.

262
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:52,385
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, I watch way too much Cosmos, so just ignore me.

263
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:54,446
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

264
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:56,007
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

265
00:17:56,047 --> 00:18:04,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some of the chats from live.vognetwork.com because, again, we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, and it is all about letting you guys have your voice in the show.

266
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:09,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know a lot of you are going to have some reactions after Tuesday, so please, we want them when they're fresh.

267
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:16,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Email us, mailbag at orangeloundtrader.com, or you can always tweet us at OLR, and we're also on Facebook and Google+.

268
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:20,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So interact with us and we'll read your comments here on the show.

269
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:28,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you've been playing this week while you wait for this next wave of game consoles to take off.

270
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:29,663
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

271
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:30,323
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

272
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:37,207
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week was kind of less eventful just because I've been getting ready to leave.

273
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:40,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I've played Ragnarok online too.

274
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:42,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm definitely going to quit WoW.

275
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:49,592
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just I'm trying to find a time to log on and finish up some stuff and give people some money if anyone ever went on the Alliance Guild again.

276
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:54,794
[SPEAKER_04]: For your money, I'll sign into my Paladin.

277
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:55,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a dollar.

278
00:18:56,857 --> 00:19:02,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot of money on my Alliance account, which makes me kind of want to transfer one of my toons over.

279
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:12,089
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've been playing some Ragnarok Online 2, and Gravity is doing this sort of drawing thing where you can win a prize.

280
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Your name is entered for every hour you're logged in, so there have been a lot of vendors.

281
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,034
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of vendors in-game.

282
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:21,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing my weekly Mass Effect 3...

283
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:27,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I would call it my rant fest whilst playing.

284
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:29,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing that.

285
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:30,719
[SPEAKER_04]: A let's play.

286
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,920
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to come up later in the show.

287
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,621
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a let's play, basically.

288
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:44,227
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's more or less me just doing the MST3K thing with it and telling off characters and calling Udina asshole.

289
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:46,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so a let's bitch.

290
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:50,270
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Mass Effect 3 Rocky Edition.

291
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

292
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:51,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

293
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:54,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so I've been doing that.

294
00:19:54,663 --> 00:20:00,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I also bought Borderlands 2 because right now I think it's still on sale on Steam.

295
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,551
[SPEAKER_07]: It went to some ridiculous price, like $13.

296
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,396
[SPEAKER_07]: So I went ahead and picked up Borderlands 2.

297
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:15,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if it's going to make me puke my brains out from motion sickness.

298
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan had such a good time playing it.

299
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:20,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan also got a new racing rig.

300
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:23,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw those pictures on Facebook.

301
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:23,792
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks sweet.

302
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:25,557
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got like three monitors, right?

303
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:26,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And a little sit-down seat.

304
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he had the monitors already.

305
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:31,451
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually three TVs.

306
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,480
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

307
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,212
[SPEAKER_07]: and the guy came and delivered it and it was pretty neat.

308
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,854
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's got a lot of racing going on.

309
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:01,495
[SPEAKER_07]: He's looking forward to Grid 2.

310
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:13,423
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I've been indirectly participating in his racing addiction by watching him and commenting and going, that car sucks.

311
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,871
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's really been the extent of my gaming.

312
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,411
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I played something else.

313
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:22,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the life of me, I can't remember what it was.

314
00:21:22,972 --> 00:21:23,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So just forget it.

315
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:25,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, Off.

316
00:21:25,593 --> 00:21:27,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, I must not have made a big impression.

317
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:28,013
[SPEAKER_04]: What is Off?

318
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:28,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I've heard of this.

319
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,834
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very, very weird little RPG.

320
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:34,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially now that I can play it windowed.

321
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:40,936
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you are sort of like controlling an avatar and your avatar is called the batter.

322
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:42,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a guy with bats.

323
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:49,958
[SPEAKER_07]: and you go around and do puzzles and talk to people and it's bizarre.

324
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:50,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put it that way.

325
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:52,399
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's free.

326
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:53,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It was done by...

327
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:56,422
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

328
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:31,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to go, you're freaking out over no news, really, nothing.

329
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:37,034
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't done anything, you're just, you know, Yahoo doesn't have the best track record, but still.

330
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:46,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I made this comparison on Bobby Blackwell's show when we were doing the call at the end of his show, as we always do, but it's kind of like Grandma taking you to a One Direction concert.

331
00:22:47,121 --> 00:22:48,481
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what that buyout feels like.

332
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:49,702
[SPEAKER_07]: What's One Direction?

333
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:52,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a British thing.

334
00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:54,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were up on all your Brit stuff.

335
00:22:55,003 --> 00:22:57,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not up on things that suck.

336
00:22:58,726 --> 00:22:59,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So you do know what it is.

337
00:22:59,727 --> 00:22:59,967
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

338
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:02,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

339
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a whole bunch of different things this week.

340
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see.

341
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:16,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Started off this week, we did VOG Gaming Night, Grand Theft Auto 3, or 3, Grand Theft Auto 4 free play.

342
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:21,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I promised I wanted to be there, but I drove to San Francisco to see Star Trek.

343
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:21,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you play the game?

344
00:23:23,462 --> 00:23:25,684
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not yet.

345
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just kind of hung out.

346
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,370
[SPEAKER_05]: We were going to try to join other people's free mode games.

347
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a big combat fest.

348
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:37,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And we didn't really want to shoot each other, which is kind of anti-Grand Theft Auto, but we were just messing around.

349
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:43,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went to the swing set of evil or death or whatever you want to call it, and we're launching cars out of that.

350
00:23:44,442 --> 00:23:45,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was kind of fun.

351
00:23:45,823 --> 00:23:47,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So we messed around with that a little bit.

352
00:23:48,145 --> 00:23:51,086
[SPEAKER_05]: and then let's see what else.

353
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:53,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and for next week, I have no idea what we're going to play.

354
00:23:54,026 --> 00:23:57,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyone has any suggestions on what you want to play?

355
00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:59,248
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be fantastic.

356
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:11,550
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I'm thinking about maybe toying with the idea of changing the night from Thursday to Friday because I know it gets kind of late, especially when we're starting at 8 o'clock on the East Coast.

357
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, on Thursday night, it's a little odd.

358
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:17,634
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe Friday, we'll see.

359
00:24:17,894 --> 00:24:19,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Also have video capture equipment finally.

360
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:22,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I got an Elgato Game Capture HD.

361
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:28,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, you have to tell me how that works, because I really want to get something for the living room here to do that type of thing.

362
00:24:28,463 --> 00:24:31,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks pretty simple, so I'll have to mess with that.

363
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, okay, so back to games.

364
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:41,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I had the urge this week to play Command & Conquer Red Alert, like, the first one.

365
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:48,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was gonna go buy it from Amazon, because they have their sale going.

366
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:52,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was doing some searching and it's freeware!

367
00:24:52,554 --> 00:24:56,338
[SPEAKER_05]: So I downloaded it for free, which is fantastic, that's the best price.

368
00:24:56,758 --> 00:25:00,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I installed it, had to add some different patches to it to get it to work in Windows 7.

369
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:06,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first thing I had to do, mod it, because that's what I do, I play modded games.

370
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:09,571
[SPEAKER_05]: So I messed with the rules I had filed to mod...

371
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:12,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of how I had it before.

372
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:18,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a really cool setup back in the day when I was playing it with all these custom units I made and stuff.

373
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:21,341
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of remembered some of that and put it back in there.

374
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:22,902
[SPEAKER_05]: So I played a skirmish game last night.

375
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:25,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It took about, like, two hours.

376
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:26,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I was toying with the computer.

377
00:25:26,465 --> 00:25:28,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't, like, immediately going for the kill.

378
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:31,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just letting them kind of, you know, live a little bit.

379
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,691
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was pretty fun.

380
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:33,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot of fun with it.

381
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:35,993
[SPEAKER_05]: It still runs like shit, though, on my computer, which is weird.

382
00:25:36,254 --> 00:25:37,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's such an old game.

383
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:38,315
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd think with, you know, the...

384
00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:40,558
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

385
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, you gave it a very favorable review over at VOG Network.

386
00:25:58,514 --> 00:25:59,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's fantastic.

387
00:26:00,314 --> 00:26:04,576
[SPEAKER_05]: See, my laptop is not very... I mean, the graphics card on it is not great.

388
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:08,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran everything in that game on low visual settings, but I never noticed.

389
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:10,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it looked just like the console version.

390
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:16,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, apparently it has really good visuals, but you have to have a pretty decent graphics card, and I'm kind of limited.

391
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:19,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't upgrade my graphics card in my laptop, so...

392
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,961
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't the only one that seemed to enjoy it.

393
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:23,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing a lot on the internet, a lot of good reviews for that game.

394
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:29,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it reminded me a lot of Bioshock Infinite, just with the different story elements.

395
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:31,725
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very linear.

396
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:36,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock was very linear.

397
00:26:36,547 --> 00:26:40,088
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little bit of, okay, you can do this, you can do that differently.

398
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:42,790
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do a lot of stealth in the game, which is kind of cool.

399
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,391
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take out lights and...

400
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:51,798
[SPEAKER_05]: and a lot of the lights thing plays into the stealth stuff.

401
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,202
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a mode that's pretty difficult.

402
00:26:54,242 --> 00:26:58,408
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually play the whole game without killing anybody except for the mutants.

403
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:01,512
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to kill the mutants because they'll just charge right at you.

404
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:02,794
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't walk past them.

405
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:20,209
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's an achievement you get for doing that and I don't know I just enjoyed it I enjoyed the storyline I haven't played 2033 I have 2033 so I should probably check it out although now I've had the ending spoiled because you know they kind of give it away at the end of this game because it ties in with it

406
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:42,735
[SPEAKER_05]: but um yeah it was a really great great game i'm glad i got to play because i wasn't really familiar with the series at all and it's pretty awesome so definitely worth checking out and i know a lot of people might want to wait until a sale comes and if it's anything like the other deep silver games it'll be deeply discounted pretty soon because they really knock the prices off their games pretty quick

407
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:55,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And just a quick plug, since you did bring up the review that you did for this game, if you check out his review over at vognetwork.com, and I noticed for the live listeners, Bobby put that in chat, but it's really easy to find if you just go to vognetwork.com.

408
00:27:56,222 --> 00:28:02,704
[SPEAKER_04]: The really cool thing about the way the website is built over at VOG Network, or the Voice of Geeks Network, is that you can actually do a response review.

409
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:06,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you also like the game, or maybe you didn't like the game and you want to have your say on that,

410
00:28:07,325 --> 00:28:08,906
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually write a response review.

411
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:20,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way it's done is that we actually screen the reviews to make sure they're not trolly, to make sure they are thought out, to make sure they're worthy of posting right underneath the main review.

412
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:23,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And we never judge that on opinion, whether you love it or hate it.

413
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:28,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We just want to make sure it sounds like you've actually played it and that you're not just first.

414
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:31,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like a Metacritic thing where you're like, one, ten.

415
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:32,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

416
00:28:32,118 --> 00:28:33,699
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be a little more thought out than that.

417
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:40,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so we will, uh, of course approve those and, uh, you get your review right there, right underneath the main review.

418
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:41,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's, it's pretty cool.

419
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:44,667
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that makes our site really unique, uh, which I like.

420
00:28:44,727 --> 00:28:47,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So you only have a limited amount of time to do that though.

421
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:49,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I don't remember what it is.

422
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, you'll have to remind me.

423
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:52,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's like two weeks or a month.

424
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:53,633
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also do that on movies.

425
00:28:53,873 --> 00:28:57,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of you've been seeing Iron Man 3, Star Trek, uh, Into Darkness.

426
00:28:57,616 --> 00:29:00,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Both those movies are also reviewed on our site and you can participate with that.

427
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:02,865
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other things I played on the Ouya.

428
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:04,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing a lot of stuff on the Ouya.

429
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:09,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually been playing a lot of the Pingo, Puzzle Poker.

430
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:14,714
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like this cross between poker and bingo.

431
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:18,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't beat my high score though.

432
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And she keeps extending, they have a high score contest going on right now.

433
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,580
[SPEAKER_05]: And she keeps extending it out.

434
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It's now June 15th is when that expires because there's not a lot of people participating.

435
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:38,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But man, I have a 591,000 score that good luck anyone beating that because I've been playing every day and I can't beat that.

436
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:39,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I got close.

437
00:29:39,205 --> 00:29:39,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I got 491 the other day.

438
00:29:41,925 --> 00:29:42,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe that.

439
00:29:42,585 --> 00:29:43,586
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty fun.

440
00:29:44,746 --> 00:29:45,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying some other games.

441
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:56,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing a lot of these quick looks at different games on the Wii, and I've actually been posting quite a bit on my YouTube channel, which is just LokiOLR.

442
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:04,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been noticing a lot of problems with those analog dead zones.

443
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't noticing it originally, but man...

444
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:11,753
[SPEAKER_05]: They're bad on those early controllers.

445
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:21,641
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not... You try to turn diagonal and your character slows down because it's like you're not pushing very far and the analog's sick.

446
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:25,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I played this Amazing Frog or something like that.

447
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:50,892
[SPEAKER_05]: and the volume on it they have these boom boxes in the game and the audio is so fucking loud it's ridiculous i had to shut the game off like it's actually funny if you watch the video um i shut it off because it's so goddamn loud on the game and like i had the volume on tv wasn't that loud because i've been playing other games in it but the audio of those boom boxes is just so fucking ridiculous that i was like i'm gonna try to smash this thing but oh that's kind of fun

448
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:51,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez, Rob.

449
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Check that out whenever.

450
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:16,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

451
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:21,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, our site is just so intricate and awesome that I forget things.

452
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,227
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too complicated.

453
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:23,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice save.

454
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:23,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice save.

455
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:24,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a user manual.

456
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:25,408
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

457
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:27,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

458
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:32,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it for this week.

459
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:39,612
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, seriously, though, there's a topic on the gaming section on the VOG forums.

460
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,293
[SPEAKER_05]: for the gaming night stuff.

461
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me know what games you guys want to play.

462
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:47,838
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to be on Xbox 360, it's just it's been that way for the last couple times.

463
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:51,821
[SPEAKER_05]: PC, PS3, whatever you guys have, whatever you want to play.

464
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:57,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously pick a game or consider games that allow a lot of people to play.

465
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:59,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Saints Row the third multiplayer, not going to work because it's only two people.

466
00:31:59,847 --> 00:32:02,890
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be fun, but you just can't really do that.

467
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:09,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So something that preferably free, like Team Fortress 2 was one that I thought of because I haven't played that and it's free, so...

468
00:32:09,986 --> 00:32:11,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

469
00:32:35,976 --> 00:32:38,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can have a no-shame noob night on Team Fortress 2.

470
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be a lot of fun.

471
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I would like to see something like that for League of Legends and Dota.

472
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:52,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a friendly, warm environment to help me learn some of those games as opposed to the mean assholes that make up a lot of the League of Legends community.

473
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:53,705
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be my mode.

474
00:32:54,286 --> 00:33:10,873
[SPEAKER_05]: You know one of the games I've been looking at, like one of the sale things that they have on Amazon right now, speaking of games to get into and stuff, Civ V. They have Civ V Gold with some other thing on there and then XCOM for like 20 bucks.

475
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:11,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull the trigger.

476
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:12,893
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

477
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:14,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Civ V is great.

478
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:16,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Civ 4 is also in there.

479
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:17,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.

480
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:20,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Civ 4 was a great game too, but Civ 5 is awesome.

481
00:33:21,091 --> 00:33:25,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would also be a game that would make a great night sometime.

482
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:30,299
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is going to have to be an OLR weekend game.

483
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

484
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:33,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

485
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:54,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Trek Online 5 Minutes

486
00:34:21,618 --> 00:34:22,418
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

487
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:54,683
[SPEAKER_04]: So I made my guy and I had fun doing the little tutorial but I had to go somewhere else so I didn't get to play I didn't get to actually interact with other people so that was that

488
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:58,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Quinto does the tutorial battle, he's the EMH

489
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:19,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

490
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:20,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

491
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, got it.

492
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:25,110
[SPEAKER_07]: They changed so much in it, it's not fun anymore.

493
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

494
00:35:27,371 --> 00:35:28,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know enough about the game.

495
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:30,972
[SPEAKER_07]: They changed the skill trees.

496
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:42,537
[SPEAKER_07]: They completely redid the skill setup for how you assign and do your points and your various weapons that you can pick up for your different classes.

497
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:47,119
[SPEAKER_07]: My normal class is an engineer and I always do the...

498
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:49,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

499
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:28,338
[SPEAKER_07]: and it just took forever to get everything and I also had like the middle level account because I had stopped paying my subscription but I had been paying a subscription so it was just all I did last time I played was hang out at Deep Space Nine and play Dabo seriously that's all I did

500
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:34,763
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com reminding us Star Trek Online has a new DLC pack called Legacy of Romulus.

501
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:35,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did notice that.

502
00:36:36,384 --> 00:36:38,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all over the splash screens when you log into the game.

503
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:46,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other folks in chat, a variety of people talking about the Star Trek game that just came out on 360 PS3 and the negative reception it's getting.

504
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:50,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen Shadow Next Gen in chat saying stay away, far, far away.

505
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:51,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

506
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:52,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo III Diablo III Diablo III

507
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:36,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I read somewhere they were doing a 25% increased XP and magic gold find weekend Because this is the one year anniversary of Diablo 3 coming out So I was like, what the hell, I'll go take a look And I actually played enough, I finally beat the damn game A year later, finally beat Diablo 3 I killed Diablo, and I'll tell you what

508
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:37,541
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

509
00:37:56,988 --> 00:38:04,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some really good gear, but when I got to the last act, when I got to the second half of Act 4, that game started kicking my ass.

510
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:05,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It got a lot harder.

511
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:09,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I finally got to the Diablo fight, I think I had to fight him like seven times before I got it.

512
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:13,736
[SPEAKER_04]: It was as intricate as a raid fight in World of Warcraft.

513
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,457
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

514
00:38:38,274 --> 00:39:00,678
[SPEAKER_04]: a couple people on my friends list got a little butthurt that I didn't want to play Diablo 3 with them but I said a long time ago I was gonna do that and I was gonna play it through because one of my friends was like let me help you kill Diablo let me help you kill Diablo and I'm like no um but uh I did it so now I'm gonna explore some of the multiplayer stuff that's the next thing I want to do in Diablo and move on to the nightmare difficulty or whatever because

515
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it worth the blood pact?

516
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:02,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

517
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it worth the blood pact?

518
00:39:18,695 --> 00:39:24,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, because I played enough WoW and I got Diablo 3 for free, so it's hard to bitch.

519
00:39:25,602 --> 00:39:32,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be fair, maybe the ending gets better when you play it on the higher difficulties, because you can play it through four different difficulties, right?

520
00:39:32,368 --> 00:39:33,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And then hardcore.

521
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,571
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I don't know.

522
00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:42,198
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, because I never beat games, I thought y'all could appreciate I did finally, finally beat Diablo 3.

523
00:39:42,238 --> 00:39:42,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

524
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:45,240
[SPEAKER_04]: and that was pretty much my gaming week.

525
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So, quick housekeeping.

526
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,202
[SPEAKER_04]: We may not have a show next week.

527
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:53,863
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I'm going to say right now it's very likely we will not have a show next week.

528
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:55,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned to Twitter for updates though.

529
00:39:55,844 --> 00:39:57,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

530
00:39:57,865 --> 00:40:05,508
[SPEAKER_04]: We will let you know mid-week because we do want to do something about the Xbox thing on Tuesday and getting some immediate reactions to that.

531
00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:08,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to plug our Facebook.

532
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:10,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and of course Twitter.

533
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR

534
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:18,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I thought we would take an opportunity and plug some of the Twitch TV live streaming we've been doing.

535
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:23,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing it all on the main OLR channel, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

536
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to try to convince Loki to move there.

537
00:40:25,962 --> 00:40:26,622
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

538
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:27,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I only did it once.

539
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:29,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now you're streaming where?

540
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:32,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's Loki OLR on Twitch.

541
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:36,410
[SPEAKER_04]: But now, Jamie, you do some more personal projects where you're doing sketching and things like that.

542
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,031
[SPEAKER_04]: So you do have your own Twitch channel for that.

543
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:38,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's that at?

544
00:40:39,473 --> 00:40:45,136
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Kuro Tsubasa, K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.

545
00:40:46,017 --> 00:40:50,399
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm actually thinking about making an actual live stream account just for the drawing.

546
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:50,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

547
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Twitch is more for gaming.

548
00:40:54,881 --> 00:41:03,446
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest though, I'm probably going to be taking a little bit of a break from doing the hardcore projects because I finally, finally finished my FemShot project.

549
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:05,962
[SPEAKER_04]: How many FemShep drawings did you end up doing?

550
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:05,962
22.

551
00:41:06,642 --> 00:41:07,522
[SPEAKER_04]: 22, wow.

552
00:41:07,582 --> 00:41:09,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Two of them were mine.

553
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:18,325
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, they're all done and they are on Mass Effecting, my Tumblr for all things Mass Effect.

554
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:26,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Well then maybe we'll have to get your gaming stuff on the OLR channel as well and then we'll have all those subscribers still built in from the days we used to do the show over there.

555
00:41:26,968 --> 00:41:27,548
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be nice.

556
00:41:28,408 --> 00:41:28,668
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

557
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:35,950
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, because when we're off a week, the live streaming is a really good way to kind of keep tabs on us during the week.

558
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:50,213
[SPEAKER_04]: We do make sure that we're streaming when there is not other programming at the Voice Geeks Network, which we always try to promote the other great independent shows, everything from TVs to movies to anime to British stuff to American stuff to Australian stuff.

559
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:52,794
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

560
00:41:53,474 --> 00:42:02,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's get into gaming news, of which there was a surprising amount of it this week, although I guess we are getting in those weeks leading up to E3, so more and more is going to come up.

561
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:04,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Only a couple weeks away, so.

562
00:42:04,978 --> 00:42:05,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki.

563
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:21,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So, EA shockingly announced that they are putting an end to their online pass program, and basically saying, yes, we are discontinuing online pass, and none of our EA titles will feature, or include that feature.

564
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:21,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

565
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Feature.

566
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:23,205
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.

567
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:23,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Feature.

568
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:32,371
[SPEAKER_05]: It says many players didn't respond to the format, and we've listened to feedback and decided to do away with it moving forward.

569
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:40,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Which makes me think, what the hell is coming up that we don't know about that's going to take the place of this?

570
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:43,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people had that reaction.

571
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:46,321
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that initial celebration, the Kermit flail.

572
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:47,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

573
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:49,444
[SPEAKER_04]: The EA got rid of the online pass.

574
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:52,148
[SPEAKER_04]: They realized it was a really off-putting idea.

575
00:42:52,428 --> 00:42:54,250
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it's like, wait a minute.

576
00:42:55,091 --> 00:42:56,253
[SPEAKER_04]: This can only get worse.

577
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:01,603
[SPEAKER_05]: EA is not a company to go, hey guys, we were wrong, sorry.

578
00:43:01,804 --> 00:43:03,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, you know that SimCity?

579
00:43:03,544 --> 00:43:04,845
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have made it offline.

580
00:43:05,045 --> 00:43:06,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a patch to make it offline.

581
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:07,745
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to do that.

582
00:43:08,026 --> 00:43:12,167
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have something that's being done by the console manufacturers to take the place of this.

583
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:14,228
[SPEAKER_04]: The money is going to come from somewhere.

584
00:43:14,268 --> 00:43:18,989
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wonder, well, even if it's not necessarily that whole thing that it's... Microtransactions?

585
00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:20,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's increased DLC.

586
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:36,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's where they're going to make and remember this point because I'm going to bring it up again later in the show when we get into something else involving EA but I think the whole DLC and the microtransactions is how they're going to make up the money I think you're going to see more games that really rely on that

587
00:43:36,681 --> 00:44:03,929
[SPEAKER_04]: you know that to make their why not it works for Facebook and free to play games and a lot of companies unfortunately are moving into that dangerous space where it's like oh well people the consumer wants to play Facebook game and they want to buy all these little free jewels and energy packs and I don't know there's a part of me that's like that's gotta be something I don't doubt that they're gonna charge you $60 for a game and have a bunch of crappy DLC for it

588
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,730
[SPEAKER_05]: or some good DLC, but probably a lot of crappy DLC.

589
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:13,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that possibly the relationship with GameStop came into this?

590
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:29,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think maybe GameStop maybe choked a bitch, so to speak, and GameStop might have been like, you know, our retail people don't really push your games because you don't get the same value out of that and we kind of like to push the 2K sports games that don't have the online passes and

591
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:42,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know if that would have really I think that maybe they just found that they weren't making a whole ton of money off of it maybe they think that their games are so awesome that people are just buying them new anyways although I don't know it's just

592
00:44:44,172 --> 00:44:45,532
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

593
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:18,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, the only companies left would be Ubisoft.

594
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:22,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Warner Games, they still might do that, but...

595
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:42,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, their next big game coming out is Batman Arkham Origins, which doesn't have an online component, but last time with Arkham Asylum, they had the whole Catwoman DLC, which was the sort of online pass, pre-order bonus, whatever you want to call it.

596
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:53,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Ubisoft and Sony, really, Sony First Party would be the other ones that have that in there.

597
00:45:55,817 --> 00:45:59,020
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you think about the whole EA getting rid of the online pass?

598
00:46:00,462 --> 00:46:08,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a smart move for one thing, but I think that they're going to replace it with something more nefarious.

599
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:14,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I trust EA as far as I can pick up their entire headquarter building and push it.

600
00:46:16,178 --> 00:46:21,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think this is a good excuse to check in with the listeners here for a minute.

601
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:23,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're going to do a live poll.

602
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:24,564
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that sound?

603
00:46:24,944 --> 00:46:30,248
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to go to vognetwork.com, and specifically live.vognetwork.com.

604
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:33,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to ask our question of the live listeners.

605
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:37,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And tonight's question is, why did EA get rid of the online pass?

606
00:46:37,773 --> 00:46:41,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's some of the options collected from what the hosts have said so far.

607
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:43,777
[SPEAKER_04]: They are truly trying to look less evil.

608
00:46:44,457 --> 00:46:46,478
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about the new consoles.

609
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:49,381
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to rely on increased DLC.

610
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:53,564
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop put them in a chokehold or something else.

611
00:46:53,864 --> 00:46:54,644
[SPEAKER_04]: You can vote now.

612
00:46:54,964 --> 00:46:58,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Register participants at live.vognetwork.com.

613
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:01,789
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see the poll up there on the site and can vote right now.

614
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:04,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see that under the chat box at live.vognetwork.com.

615
00:47:05,052 --> 00:47:07,113
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go over those results there in just a minute.

616
00:47:07,613 --> 00:47:11,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool thing is that once you vote, you can actually see the results come in live.

617
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:18,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And so far, everybody is saying there's something about the new consoles, dot, dot, dot.

618
00:47:18,143 --> 00:47:19,784
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, there's nothing already.

619
00:47:19,884 --> 00:47:25,630
[SPEAKER_05]: They've already talked about the PlayStation 4, and they've said that there's nothing preventing used games.

620
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:27,332
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't...

621
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:31,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if there is going to be anything with new consoles.

622
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they just decided, hey, you know what?

623
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,236
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just not making a ton of money off of this.

624
00:47:36,516 --> 00:47:38,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I thought they said they were making quite a bit of money.

625
00:47:38,937 --> 00:47:42,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So why would you just get rid of money or give up on that?

626
00:47:42,518 --> 00:47:43,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

627
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:47,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is it really that much of a trying to save face after what happened with SimCity?

628
00:47:48,781 --> 00:47:50,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people are kind of expecting that.

629
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:51,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, maybe...

630
00:47:52,982 --> 00:47:53,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

631
00:47:53,482 --> 00:47:56,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know what their thought process could be.

632
00:47:56,384 --> 00:47:57,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll find out.

633
00:47:57,425 --> 00:47:59,226
[SPEAKER_05]: We're definitely not going to find out on Tuesday.

634
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:04,088
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to say, hey, by the way, we're going to have a feature that's going to prevent you from buying music.

635
00:48:04,568 --> 00:48:09,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the negative stuff or anything that can be perceived as negative, that's not coming out on Tuesday.

636
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:12,593
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to come out on stage and say, oh, yeah, and this Xbox has to...

637
00:48:13,073 --> 00:48:16,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be cool if they did address all those.

638
00:48:16,236 --> 00:48:19,419
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had actual responses that were positive, like, it's not always online.

639
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:20,621
[SPEAKER_05]: We've heard your worries, and it's not.

640
00:48:29,769 --> 00:48:39,935
[SPEAKER_04]: All the guy talking, all the talking head would have to do is get up there and say, you know, and don't worry if I lose my internet connection, I can still play the game.

641
00:48:40,315 --> 00:48:43,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So stop tweeting about it, you know, or just make a little joke about it.

642
00:48:43,817 --> 00:48:44,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's all they would need to do.

643
00:48:45,578 --> 00:48:48,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody could laugh it off like an old sitcom at the end.

644
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:50,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

645
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:51,821
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

646
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:52,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

647
00:48:52,662 --> 00:48:54,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to check the results here.

648
00:48:54,563 --> 00:48:56,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Still 58% of the vote.

649
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:58,406
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about the new consoles.

650
00:48:58,526 --> 00:49:00,708
[SPEAKER_04]: No votes for GameStop putting them in a chokehold, though.

651
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:02,009
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't think that seems to be it.

652
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,290
[SPEAKER_04]: So a large amount of people as well.

653
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,853
[SPEAKER_04]: 30% they're going to rely on increased DLC.

654
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:12,496
[SPEAKER_04]: About 8% right now saying they are truly trying to look less evil.

655
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:14,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So 8% giving them the benefit of the doubt there.

656
00:49:15,678 --> 00:49:16,159
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

657
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check in with that poll one more time after this story.

658
00:49:19,662 --> 00:49:22,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you guys a last chance to vote there at live.vognetwork.com.

659
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:25,208
[SPEAKER_04]: This is getting a little bit of controversy this week.

660
00:49:25,248 --> 00:49:30,454
[SPEAKER_04]: The story that's going around about a game that isn't even out here in America, but a lot of people here have an opinion on it.

661
00:49:31,074 --> 00:49:32,255
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is in Japan only.

662
00:49:32,315 --> 00:49:36,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo of Japan makes this series called Tomodachi Collection New Life.

663
00:49:36,876 --> 00:49:55,143
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a game that's on the 3DS, and from my understanding of the game, I'm not going to confess to know a whole lot about this game, but it's kind of Nintendo's answer to The Sims slash Animal Crossing, and it uses Miis, and it's one of those life simulation type of games.

664
00:49:55,843 --> 00:50:06,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently there is a glitch in the game, and according to some people in Japan, what happens with the glitch is that the glitch enables same-sex marriages to appear.

665
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:19,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you do, you bring your Miis over to the 3DS using the Mii transfer tool, and somehow this glitch will allow your character to bathe with characters of the same gender, make babies...

666
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:42,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Defy the laws of science and everything and you know raise babies and all that stuff with the whole same gender and obviously places like Tumblr are very and the story actually says this hey it's true though places like Tumblr and some of the fan sites are very happy about this and posting their pictures of their happy little gay family and so forth and you know

667
00:50:43,554 --> 00:50:49,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, as a gay guy myself, I like to see a lot of this stuff that's positive in games.

668
00:50:50,197 --> 00:50:52,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the way The Sims does it.

669
00:50:52,597 --> 00:50:53,798
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sims is a great model.

670
00:50:53,838 --> 00:51:00,340
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one of those games where it's like, you know, The Sims just will like whatever they like, whatever you want them to like.

671
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,621
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just no...

672
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:03,502
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

673
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:29,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a notice on home menus notification that a child will be sent on a journey but no actual message is there.

674
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:33,720
[SPEAKER_04]: That's clearly something in the game that I don't know much about because I don't know the series very well.

675
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,342
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of people... Instead of taking the Republican route, you know?

676
00:51:37,342 --> 00:51:38,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

677
00:51:38,343 --> 00:51:51,871
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people out there that are like... You know the way games journalism works where it's copy-paste, copy-paste, but make the headline more sensationalist each time is that Nintendo bans same-sex marriage from their game.

678
00:51:52,051 --> 00:51:52,271
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

679
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:52,411
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

680
00:51:53,812 --> 00:52:01,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, maybe the way this really is, is that Nintendo didn't plan to put same-sex marriage in their game.

681
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:09,083
[SPEAKER_04]: It ended up there anyway through a bug, which will also cause save files to corrupt and so forth, so they've got to do something about it.

682
00:52:09,603 --> 00:52:15,547
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't think they're necessarily trying to patch out the gay marriage, but that wasn't supposed to be there in the first place.

683
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:18,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not as upset about this as you might think.

684
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:27,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, again, I'm gay myself and I like to see this stuff in games, but I also realize a lot of Japanese games don't have gay marriage stuff in their games.

685
00:52:28,511 --> 00:52:32,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI, you could marry in that game, but they didn't do same-gender weddings.

686
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:35,832
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something they were thinking about or whatever, but they never did it.

687
00:52:36,212 --> 00:52:37,832
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like that for Ragnarok Online.

688
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they do same-gender as in Ragnarok?

689
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they did.

690
00:52:42,471 --> 00:52:44,192
[SPEAKER_07]: You had like marriage skills.

691
00:52:44,573 --> 00:52:49,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you married your character, you could teleport to wherever your character was or do like healing stuff.

692
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:54,360
[SPEAKER_07]: But they didn't have it to where it would be same gendered.

693
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:00,665
[SPEAKER_07]: And people who took private servers actually had to modify some of the programming in the game to enable it.

694
00:53:02,274 --> 00:53:19,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya in chat says from what I read of the story the fix is only for the problems with the side effects caused by the glitch and that would be a great way to kind of resolve this scenario so that way it's like okay if people kind of figured out how to work the system and get two guys in there then whatever and I think that's that's a good way to do it.

695
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:42,286
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think we are headed in the right direction folks culturally like I look at games like Mass Effect and yes I know here I am bringing up that game again but guys it's done so well in that series that I there's a reason why I really love Mass Effect and and games like The Sims and other games and you look at what's happening culturally is that what did we have three states that

696
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:43,706
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

697
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:05,156
[SPEAKER_04]: will update to reflect that as well.

698
00:54:05,577 --> 00:54:18,102
[SPEAKER_04]: But for right now, I don't believe gay marriage is legal in Japan, so it's probably why they didn't think to really put it in there as a fully fleshed out thing, and why it is still kind of a bug that the two guys actually make the baby.

699
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:20,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, you know, you would...

700
00:54:21,844 --> 00:54:22,224
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

701
00:54:49,864 --> 00:54:58,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but they actually are working on using cloning technology so that two people of the same gender can have a child together.

702
00:54:59,656 --> 00:55:00,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So just saying, science.

703
00:55:02,392 --> 00:55:22,522
[SPEAKER_04]: so I think generally culturally and I'm not trying to get too political on this show but obviously you know it's an issue it's kind of important to me it's one of those things where it's like you know it's it's more and more becoming not a big fucking deal and that's really what this should be is it's not a big fucking deal if two guys want to do something that doesn't affect your life whatsoever you know what I mean it's just

704
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:51,586
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah anyway I'll get off my soapbox so what do you think DarkSakura about this Tomodachi collection I think people are just I think unfortunately the sensationalism of certain gaming websites and so forth tended to make this story a bigger deal than it is but I think certainly there's got to be Nintendo kind of looking at this going oh well I guess if people are going to have these tumblers and so forth about it maybe this is something we should have thought of putting into their first place I don't know what do you think Jamie uh

705
00:55:53,348 --> 00:56:18,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it should have been there from the get-go, and if it's possible, I mean, clearly the glitch is causing some problems, and I have no problem with them fixing those effects of the glitch, but I would want them to see them leave in the option to actually even make it, if they could incorporate some way to make that a regular feature in the game, instead of just it being a glitch, and using that to fix the problems, then that would be the way I would go.

706
00:56:19,255 --> 00:56:29,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would also request that they actually bring this game over to America or, you know, so I can feel like I know what the fuck I'm talking about with this game because I'm going to be honest, I don't.

707
00:56:29,704 --> 00:56:35,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only really go off of screenshots and little YouTubes and things I see of the game and my assumptions.

708
00:56:35,268 --> 00:56:36,790
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I would play it.

709
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:38,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to know a little more about what this game is.

710
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:41,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomodachi means friend.

711
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:44,536
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a buddy game.

712
00:56:46,097 --> 00:56:55,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well let's move on Oh, quickly, I'm going to close out the poll here Here's the final results of our poll The winner, why did EA get rid of the online pass?

713
00:56:55,604 --> 00:57:09,274
[SPEAKER_04]: 57% of the vote, there's something about the new consoles Second place, they're going to rely on increased DLC So there you go, those are the results of the live poll Thank you guys for voting at live.vognetwork.com Let's move on to the next story, DarkSakra

714
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:15,693
[SPEAKER_07]: In other news, now this is probably why I've had Sega on the brain for a little while.

715
00:57:17,694 --> 00:57:22,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Sega is, well we've always known that Sega's been in bed with Nintendo.

716
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:27,337
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no idea what they're doing in this bed, but they're doing stuff.

717
00:57:27,718 --> 00:57:34,940
[SPEAKER_07]: In this case, Sega has announced that they are in an exclusive partnership with Nintendo of America.

718
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,261
[SPEAKER_07]: They are gay married to Nintendo.

719
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:38,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

720
00:57:59,617 --> 00:58:05,927
[SPEAKER_07]: The third one is still to be announced, but these are Wii U and 3DS.

721
00:58:06,528 --> 00:58:11,135
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that it would be the ideal platform, that's a quote, to showcase Sonic.

722
00:58:12,637 --> 00:58:21,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, though, since people aren't buying Wii U's, Sega is once again showing that their business sense is kind of in the U.S.

723
00:58:22,379 --> 00:58:24,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is Sega of America and Sega Europe.

724
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see the official Sega of Japan.

725
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this really a big deal, though?

726
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:35,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, Sonic games, not known for their quality these days so much.

727
00:58:36,622 --> 00:58:40,765
[SPEAKER_05]: They've had several Sonic games that have been exclusive to the Nintendo platform.

728
00:58:40,805 --> 00:58:43,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic Colors, Sonic and the Secret Rings.

729
00:58:43,427 --> 00:58:45,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario and Sonic and the Olympics, which sells really well.

730
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:46,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Those games sell very well.

731
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

732
00:58:50,232 --> 00:58:53,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is one of those three games they're doing, which makes sense.

733
00:58:53,914 --> 00:58:56,997
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it sold well because the Wii sold well, right?

734
00:58:58,157 --> 00:58:59,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.

735
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:01,580
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Wii U's not.

736
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:01,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

737
00:59:03,234 --> 00:59:06,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's going to suck for Sega then, I guess.

738
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:12,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Sega's really had, especially Sega of America, had a great track record.

739
00:59:14,036 --> 00:59:31,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they'd come out and said it's going to be Phantasy Star Online 2 that's going to be on the Wii U that would have given me something to get really excited about which I'm surprised something like that isn't happening well you never know E3 might be interesting speaking of which Rob you need to play that with me on PC is there an English patch yet for that?

740
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:40,755
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah it's mostly English it's English enough that you could be able to play it I might have to do that we'll see it's actually super fun it's exactly like the last one so it's good

741
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:52,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadow Next Gen in our chatroom with an interesting perspective saying, Rob, with Nintendo helping to work on Sonic now, though, maybe it will have that magic Nintendo polish that a lot of first-party Nintendo titles have.

742
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:56,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Could Nintendo's involvement make this sweeter?

743
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:02,431
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I do have to make a slight rebuttal, which I've said in the chatroom.

744
01:00:02,711 --> 01:00:04,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic Generations was pretty damn good.

745
01:00:04,953 --> 01:00:05,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, fair enough.

746
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:08,234
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was also out on multiple platforms.

747
01:00:08,475 --> 01:00:08,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

748
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:11,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got it on PC.

749
01:00:11,198 --> 01:00:12,679
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun on PC.

750
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's going to make a difference.

751
01:00:15,701 --> 01:00:17,823
[SPEAKER_07]: It just has to not be a turd of a game.

752
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:23,387
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the last really big turd in the Sonic franchise?

753
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:24,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic Adventure 2?

754
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,829
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Sonic Adventure 2 was okay.

755
01:00:27,569 --> 01:00:28,690
[SPEAKER_07]: The first Sonic Adventure was good.

756
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:29,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic 4.

757
01:00:29,831 --> 01:00:31,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a huge turd.

758
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:36,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't even do much in the way of

759
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:38,951
[SPEAKER_07]: being fun.

760
01:00:39,271 --> 01:00:39,992
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wasn't.

761
01:00:40,852 --> 01:00:49,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, Tigerclaw theorizes in our chat room, what if part of the deal with Sega was that one of the Nintendo characters makes a cameo somewhere in the new Sonic game?

762
01:00:50,215 --> 01:00:50,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy.

763
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:52,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that plumber can run that fast?

764
01:00:54,396 --> 01:00:55,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything's possible.

765
01:00:55,957 --> 01:00:56,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything's possible.

766
01:00:57,997 --> 01:00:58,377
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

767
01:00:58,497 --> 01:01:01,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will see what happens with this partnership.

768
01:01:02,478 --> 01:01:04,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other stuff coming out of the Nintendo Direct, though.

769
01:01:04,439 --> 01:01:04,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

770
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:13,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they finally announced a date for Wonderful 101, which is on September 15th in North America and August 23rd in Europe.

771
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:16,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all they said about it.

772
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So fantastic.

773
01:01:18,443 --> 01:01:22,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Super Luigi U, the DLC is arriving on the 20th of June.

774
01:01:23,568 --> 01:01:32,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you don't want to get it as DLC, you can pay an extra $10 and get a standalone disc, which is coming out August 25th.

775
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:38,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the reason they're doing that is just to say, hey, look, we have games coming out for the Wii U. Because...

776
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:42,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why else they would do that.

777
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:47,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of figured they would do that later on when they do a Game of the Year edition of New Super Mario Bros.

778
01:01:47,352 --> 01:01:52,594
[SPEAKER_04]: with New Luigi U. Because again, not every household in America is online.

779
01:01:53,634 --> 01:01:57,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, if you're not online, but you have a Wii U, I'm not sure how that works.

780
01:01:58,016 --> 01:02:05,539
[SPEAKER_04]: You must live in a real remote part of the US or something, but I think there's enough people without online that justify it.

781
01:02:06,399 --> 01:02:10,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the Wii U could be in a kid's bedroom, which maybe doesn't have online or something, you know?

782
01:02:10,669 --> 01:02:11,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

783
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,932
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're putting it out, so I guess that's kind of cool.

784
01:02:15,472 --> 01:02:25,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And then last but not least, this is kind of neat because I'm not going to E3, so you get to play unreleased Wii U games at Best Buy during E3.

785
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:27,519
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have demo kiosks at over 100 locations.

786
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:29,160
[SPEAKER_05]: E3

787
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting how Nintendo is really changing up the E3 strategy this year.

788
01:02:56,765 --> 01:03:07,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, we had a couple years ago, and I think this still happens to some extent, Microsoft, I remember one year, went very big on bringing E3 home where you could download all the demos and so forth.

789
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:09,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish they would do that.

790
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:09,839
[SPEAKER_05]: MOTOGP

791
01:03:25,606 --> 01:03:26,887
[SPEAKER_05]: and now they don't do that anymore.

792
01:03:27,127 --> 01:03:35,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I really wish they would do that because a lot of, well, the majority of the people that are paying attention to E3 can't go to that.

793
01:03:35,553 --> 01:03:39,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think Nintendo is making you go to Best Buy and not just letting you download them to your Wii U?

794
01:03:39,735 --> 01:03:40,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Partnership.

795
01:03:41,356 --> 01:04:08,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it's part partnership and it's also part so you can get the sales pitch while you're there about picking up a Wii U because you know Nintendo has just like Microsoft and just like any other company has the people who go out to the stores they're trying to sell the console too because the problem isn't getting people that own the Wii U to buy more games it's getting people to buy the Wii U so why not have those people in the stores ready to try to sell the consoles I think it's a great concept

796
01:04:10,339 --> 01:04:11,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you want to buy a console today?

797
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:17,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if they end up dropping the price, which I know is a long shot, but now it's on sale.

798
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:18,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It's even cheaper than it was before.

799
01:04:18,886 --> 01:04:19,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you want to get one?

800
01:04:20,687 --> 01:04:22,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Have somebody there to put on a little bit of that pressure.

801
01:04:23,269 --> 01:04:26,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think we'll see a Wii U Animal Crossing this year?

802
01:04:27,192 --> 01:04:28,413
[SPEAKER_04]: A Wii U Animal Crossing?

803
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,794
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not with the 3DS.

804
01:04:29,854 --> 01:04:34,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It would cannibalize the 3DS one too much because that one is going to be coming out within weeks of E3.

805
01:04:34,978 --> 01:04:36,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, probably next year.

806
01:04:37,182 --> 01:04:39,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's really going to be anything innovative.

807
01:04:39,283 --> 01:04:39,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right?

808
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:41,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can sit down now.

809
01:04:42,564 --> 01:04:42,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh!

810
01:04:43,164 --> 01:04:43,565
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

811
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:44,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I could sit down before.

812
01:04:44,685 --> 01:04:48,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I could go get a latte and sit down.

813
01:04:48,346 --> 01:04:50,007
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you can... What were the other big things?

814
01:04:50,027 --> 01:04:50,927
[SPEAKER_04]: There's benches.

815
01:04:50,947 --> 01:04:52,348
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the mayor.

816
01:04:52,948 --> 01:04:53,749
[SPEAKER_04]: You can swim.

817
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:58,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they... Okay, so to be fair, they did kind of change the main plot of sorts.

818
01:04:59,111 --> 01:05:03,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm sorry, but... Did it have virtual console games like it did in the GameCube version?

819
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:04,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was awesome.

820
01:05:05,549 --> 01:05:16,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually liked my indentured servitude to Tom Nook and considering that we're selling virtual console games for 30 cents why can't you put some NES games in there?

821
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:18,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you're losing money on that

822
01:05:20,086 --> 01:05:20,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

823
01:05:49,861 --> 01:05:51,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Who needs PR when you've got people to do it for free?

824
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:52,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

825
01:05:53,702 --> 01:05:54,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

826
01:05:54,643 --> 01:05:55,603
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be interesting.

827
01:05:55,623 --> 01:05:58,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to see how this works out for them because it could be a game changer.

828
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:08,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not going to sit here, though, and say E3 is dead or dying because there was a time when E3 didn't have anything to do with the media and all this stuff.

829
01:06:08,087 --> 01:06:10,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Before the internet, there was still E3.

830
01:06:10,928 --> 01:06:16,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And granted, you would see screenshots and things in Nintendo Power, but it was not the blowout thing that it is today.

831
01:06:17,611 --> 01:06:22,436
[SPEAKER_04]: E3 started because it's the one time during the year when everybody in the industry kind of gets together under the same roof.

832
01:06:22,696 --> 01:06:26,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of wheeling and dealing that happens at E3 that the media doesn't even know about.

833
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:28,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, think about it.

834
01:06:29,143 --> 01:06:33,007
[SPEAKER_04]: One year I went to E3, I think it was 2006, maybe it was, it might have been 2010, I don't know.

835
01:06:33,188 --> 01:06:34,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple had a booth at E3, or excuse me,

836
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:35,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a booth.

837
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple had a conference room at E3.

838
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:40,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a behind closed doors thing.

839
01:06:40,092 --> 01:06:43,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people were thinking, ooh, is Apple doing a game console?

840
01:06:43,353 --> 01:06:44,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, ooh, you know, and that whole thing.

841
01:06:44,933 --> 01:06:49,495
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Apple was probably showing off the iPhone or the iPad, depending on whatever year it was.

842
01:06:49,815 --> 01:06:53,996
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably what they were showing in that little room to developers who were there at the same roof.

843
01:06:54,496 --> 01:06:55,917
[SPEAKER_04]: That had nothing to do with the media.

844
01:06:56,017 --> 01:07:02,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple was not rolling that out to the media yet, but Apple was probably trying, again, this is a huge theory here because I don't know anything, but

845
01:07:02,959 --> 01:07:09,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that that's part of the wheeling and dealing that happens at E3 that has nothing to do with the media interaction.

846
01:07:10,141 --> 01:07:12,942
[SPEAKER_04]: The media could not come to E3 and E3 I think would still happen.

847
01:07:13,342 --> 01:07:17,223
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not be as big of a deal, but I think there would still be the necessity for the show.

848
01:07:18,483 --> 01:07:20,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow, tangent.

849
01:07:21,484 --> 01:07:24,685
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's move on with something that doesn't have to do with Nintendo.

850
01:07:25,705 --> 01:07:28,506
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to do with Steam, which we brought up earlier in the show.

851
01:07:28,806 --> 01:07:29,266
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

852
01:07:49,804 --> 01:07:54,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Steam Trading Cards Steam Trading Cards Steam Trading Cards Steam Trading Cards Steam Trading Cards Steam Trading Cards

853
01:08:17,387 --> 01:08:17,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

854
01:08:32,535 --> 01:09:02,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Dota and Half-Life which you would expect of course the Valve games are going to be involved but they do have Don't Starve and Counter-Strike Global Offensive so at least there's some other games participating but I would like to see more third parties kind of get in on this to really give value added to this and I didn't really understand how it works either as far as like see here's the thing I went back to play Portal 2 I was actually just going to play Portal 2 and I noticed I don't have any of my achievements on Portal 2 like they all disappeared somehow what?

855
01:09:02,401 --> 01:09:04,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's weird.

856
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:08,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started playing it again, but I haven't gotten any cards or anything.

857
01:09:08,802 --> 01:09:15,683
[SPEAKER_05]: And then today I got a notification saying that I got some new items in my inventory.

858
01:09:15,763 --> 01:09:21,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now I have three items marked as Steam Trading Card Beta Access.

859
01:09:21,685 --> 01:09:29,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says, Steam Trading Card Beta Access Extra Copy Grants Early Access to Steam Trading Card Beta Game Badges and New Profile Cards.

860
01:09:29,446 --> 01:09:33,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Join Steam Trade Carding Group and post your feedback in the discussions area.

861
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:40,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Select add to my game library to activate, which I tried to do because I didn't see it on my library and it won't let me do that.

862
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:44,803
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to send one of those to the username I just private messaged you.

863
01:09:46,525 --> 01:09:47,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can check that out.

864
01:09:47,346 --> 01:09:47,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I will do that.

865
01:09:48,266 --> 01:09:48,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

866
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:49,947
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

867
01:09:50,768 --> 01:09:54,230
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of the whole thing as a concept, though?

868
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just assume it works as we read it.

869
01:09:56,272 --> 01:09:56,672
[SPEAKER_04]: It's neat.

870
01:09:56,712 --> 01:09:58,333
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more interesting than trophies.

871
01:09:58,413 --> 01:10:00,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because a lot of times it's like an achievement.

872
01:10:00,815 --> 01:10:02,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just bring value to that.

873
01:10:02,996 --> 01:10:08,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying, you can buy the trading cards through the Steam Community Market.

874
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, I sold two extra passes.

875
01:10:11,102 --> 01:10:12,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I got $1.50 for each.

876
01:10:13,663 --> 01:10:16,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like selling stuff in the Diablo real money auction house.

877
01:10:16,986 --> 01:10:19,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Valve didn't probably take a dollar out of that.

878
01:10:21,395 --> 01:10:21,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds interesting.

879
01:10:23,339 --> 01:10:26,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess any excuse to go back and play Portal and Half-Life and all that, right?

880
01:10:26,886 --> 01:10:27,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on, DarkSakura.

881
01:10:28,908 --> 01:10:32,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is something that has my hubby super, super excited.

882
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:36,751
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, he was practically bouncing in his seat over this.

883
01:10:37,312 --> 01:10:45,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Gran Turismo 6 has been announced, and there's a demo going to be out in July.

884
01:10:47,056 --> 01:10:54,419
[SPEAKER_07]: The information actually hit, I think, the European Sony news networks not too long ago.

885
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:04,244
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that it's going to be on the PS3 and that they're basically going to keep it on that system.

886
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:09,127
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't say anything about it being out for the next-gen system.

887
01:11:09,207 --> 01:11:13,289
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have GT Academy in 2013 as well.

888
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:19,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And that this new version is going to have 1,200 cars, 33 locations, and 71 layouts.

889
01:11:20,393 --> 01:11:23,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's seven more locations than Gran Turismo 5 had.

890
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:25,636
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will have the UK Silverstone Circuit.

891
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:28,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

892
01:11:29,567 --> 01:11:29,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

893
01:11:29,787 --> 01:11:34,789
[SPEAKER_07]: It says new physics engine, new modeling, all kinds of stuff.

894
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:36,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that?

895
01:11:37,091 --> 01:11:37,331
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

896
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:39,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan goes, and I will buy it.

897
01:11:39,732 --> 01:11:42,834
[SPEAKER_07]: He came in, raised his hands in the air and goes, and I will buy it.

898
01:11:42,874 --> 01:11:45,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, interesting though that it's not PlayStation 4.

899
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:48,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the thing that really shocked people is that, well...

900
01:11:50,358 --> 01:11:53,861
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 4 has this whole racing club or what do they call that game?

901
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:55,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Drive club.

902
01:11:55,683 --> 01:11:56,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Drive club or whatever.

903
01:11:56,703 --> 01:11:58,064
[SPEAKER_04]: But yet there's no Gran Turismo.

904
01:11:58,985 --> 01:12:00,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is going to be on the PlayStation 3.

905
01:12:02,748 --> 01:12:08,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Without the PlayStation 4 being backwards compatible, Gran Turismo 6 is a great reason not to upgrade.

906
01:12:09,653 --> 01:12:11,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but also put it out this way.

907
01:12:11,435 --> 01:12:15,198
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to guarantee sales, why not put it out for the system that everyone already has?

908
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:21,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but that's going to be a problem when the new systems start coming to get people to buy them.

909
01:12:21,722 --> 01:12:22,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

910
01:12:22,623 --> 01:12:29,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they're going to have maybe some special edition come out later that everyone's going to go, ooh, we need this instead.

911
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:31,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Gran Turismo 6 HD or something?

912
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:33,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

913
01:12:33,469 --> 01:12:42,053
[SPEAKER_04]: WhatUpG in our chat says, each of the PlayStation systems have had two main Gran Turismo games, so I expect PlayStation 4 to have Gran Turismo 7 and 8.

914
01:12:42,613 --> 01:12:45,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe there's just a pattern that's trying to not be broken here.

915
01:12:46,422 --> 01:12:48,484
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good point.

916
01:12:48,724 --> 01:12:52,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, they were saying that for Gran Turismo 5, 10 million copies were sold.

917
01:12:54,288 --> 01:13:01,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And that it is the Gran Turismo franchise itself is their most successful franchise ever, especially in Europe.

918
01:13:03,374 --> 01:13:06,536
[SPEAKER_07]: 70 million copies over the span of the series.

919
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:08,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

920
01:13:09,778 --> 01:13:11,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a wise move to put it on PS3.

921
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:15,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, but it's very strange.

922
01:13:16,036 --> 01:13:25,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems a little bit like cannibalizing PlayStation 4, but I guess they feel there'll still be plenty of people wanting to pick up a PlayStation 4 for Drive Club, so I don't know.

923
01:13:25,714 --> 01:13:37,076
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I have a feeling that they're going to really push Gran Turismo 7 for PS4 and make that a big selling point like around, say, some sort of major holiday or big sales period.

924
01:13:37,096 --> 01:13:43,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's just weird to me that Gran Turismo 6 and Drive Club for PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 4 are all around the same time, essentially.

925
01:13:44,138 --> 01:13:44,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird.

926
01:13:44,738 --> 01:13:49,139
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying that they may release another version of PlayStation 4 later on after launch.

927
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:49,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

928
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:52,300
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's pretty much what I was anticipating.

929
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:59,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that will be coming out a little bit sooner than Gran Turismo 6, as in games that are out this week.

930
01:13:59,543 --> 01:14:01,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll start with Loki in the U.S.

931
01:14:02,364 --> 01:14:04,545
[SPEAKER_05]: This week, there's actually quite a few things.

932
01:14:05,765 --> 01:14:11,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting off, Resident Evil Revelations HD is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.

933
01:14:15,209 --> 01:14:43,968
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I know the game that everybody is super excited for Fast and the Furious Showdown which is being developed by the guys that did the NASCAR games that's coming out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360 the Wii U and the 3DS and then there's the Worms Collection which is kind of a re-release of some of the Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network games that's coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 this week

934
01:14:45,749 --> 01:15:00,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, LEGO Batman 2 DC Super Heroes on the Wii U. And on the 3DS, on Friday actually, we'll be getting Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D.

935
01:15:00,974 --> 01:15:03,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to be coming out as well.

936
01:15:04,215 --> 01:15:09,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And last game this week, Sniper Elite V2 on the Wii U. So hey, there's Wii U games coming out.

937
01:15:10,417 --> 01:15:13,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, they are games that have come out a long time ago, like a year ago.

938
01:15:13,478 --> 01:15:13,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

939
01:15:17,293 --> 01:15:21,555
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases that are going to happen over there.

940
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:26,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off with the PlayStation 3 this week on May 23rd.

941

943
01:15:33,781 --> 01:15:35,202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going into the Best Hits Collection.

944
01:15:35,782 --> 01:15:40,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Kamen Rider Batride War in regular and premium editions is out this week from Namco Bandai.

945
01:15:41,105 --> 01:15:41,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play that.

946
01:15:41,885 --> 01:15:43,326
[SPEAKER_04]: As they call it over there, Bandai Namco.

947
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:51,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Terraria is getting a Japanese release, believe it or not, and that will be out this week as well as The Sims 3 Pets getting a price reduction on PlayStation 3.

948
01:15:52,271 --> 01:15:58,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Also on PS3 this week, Z slash X, Zillions of Enemy X, Zetsukai no Crusade.

949
01:15:58,995 --> 01:16:03,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that is Zillions of Enemy X. How many?

950
01:16:03,837 --> 01:16:04,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Zillions.

951
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:07,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Robby just made me sad.

952
01:16:07,388 --> 01:16:07,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

953
01:16:08,488 --> 01:16:10,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that just makes me actually want a zillion game.

954
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:14,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Like on Master System, only all updated and new.

955
01:16:15,292 --> 01:16:21,775
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Xbox 360 this week, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is there as well in a regular and a limited set.

956
01:16:21,835 --> 01:16:23,856
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much all you get on the 360 this week.

957
01:16:24,696 --> 01:16:28,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the Vita, BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend also gets a price cut there.

958
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:34,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And Valhalla Knights 3 comes out this week from Marvelous Entertainment over in Japan.

959
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:37,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out the Wii U. Yes, there is a game.

960
01:16:37,242 --> 01:16:40,562
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is out there as well.

961
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:42,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the consoles in Japan getting that.

962
01:16:43,283 --> 01:16:48,204
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 3DS this week, there is a new 3DS XL model, or as they call it, the LL.

963
01:16:48,304 --> 01:16:54,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Shimogami Tensei IV Limited model because Shimogami Tensei IV is out this week in Japan.

964
01:16:54,706 --> 01:16:55,766
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a pretty big release.

965
01:16:56,386 --> 01:16:58,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's some people going to be importing that one.

966
01:16:58,987 --> 01:17:01,148
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually get that retail or download.

967
01:17:01,188 --> 01:17:02,588
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole accessory set.

968
01:17:02,808 --> 01:17:08,629
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a skin for your... If you're a Shin Megami Tensei fan, you're probably importing tons of shit this week from Japan.

969
01:17:09,349 --> 01:17:10,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck to your wallet.

970
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:18,131
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are not a Shin Megami Tensei fan, perhaps Tamagotchi no Doki Doki Dream Omesechi would be of interest to you.

971
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:21,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's another Tamagotchi game on the 3DS.

972
01:17:22,772 --> 01:17:25,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you should just get Shin Megami Tensei IV if you're going to import one or the other.

973
01:17:26,637 --> 01:17:27,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

974
01:17:27,859 --> 01:17:31,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, on the PSP, yes, they are still making games for the PSP in Japan.

975
01:17:33,225 --> 01:17:40,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Zeroji no Kane to Cinderella Halloween Wedding in regular and deluxe editions and Rakuun Danshi coming out.

976
01:17:41,435 --> 01:17:42,776
[SPEAKER_04]: What is Cinderella Wedding?

977
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:45,137
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not, I don't think the Disney Cinderella.

978
01:17:45,177 --> 01:17:49,440
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks like one of those games based off an anime.

979
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:59,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, it looks like one of those romance games because I see girl and guy in the bar, girl hanging off guy, guy kissing girl and all this stuff.

980
01:17:59,526 --> 01:18:01,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So it must be one of those series.

981
01:18:03,108 --> 01:18:04,549
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's it for Japan.

982
01:18:04,629 --> 01:18:06,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's travel over to the UK.

983
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:10,872
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 22nd, we have the Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.

984
01:18:10,912 --> 01:18:12,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Midna, stop eating that!

985
01:18:12,613 --> 01:18:12,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

986
01:18:13,554 --> 01:18:15,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Midna was eating my headphone cable.

987
01:18:18,059 --> 01:18:30,471
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 24th, we have Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, Dust and the Lesion Tale, Fast and Furious Showdown, Big Whoop, Resident Evil Revelations, and Sniper Elite V2.

988
01:18:33,379 --> 01:18:38,165
[SPEAKER_04]: to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.

989
01:18:38,566 --> 01:18:40,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Use the passphrase, test.

990
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:41,370
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

991
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:43,332
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is, UK.

992
01:18:43,372 --> 01:18:47,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

993
01:18:47,838 --> 01:18:47,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

994
01:18:48,759 --> 01:18:56,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so Nintendo has kind of taken an action against these Let's Play videos on YouTube.

995
01:18:57,261 --> 01:19:14,785
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to happen is partnering, I guess, with YouTube, they're going to be using their content ID match system to basically take the ad revenue that these Let's Play videos are getting

996
01:19:17,387 --> 01:19:32,646
[SPEAKER_05]: if they're monetized and that's all going to be going to Nintendo and then also they're going to be having ads I guess before and after the videos as well I guess it's going to somehow automatically get added in for Nintendo stuff

997
01:19:33,726 --> 01:19:59,052
[SPEAKER_05]: um so that kind of sucks I guess um although I mean I know YouTube has policies against the let's play stuff you know although there's still a ton of it on there and it's kind of you know confusing because some companies will let you do let's plays on their stuff like Minecraft for example there's a big thing in saying hey do film whatever you want do whatever you want you know we're not gonna it's it's cool you know so um

998
01:20:00,669 --> 01:20:15,244
[SPEAKER_05]: and I know other they're not taking the videos down but I mean the fact that they're kind of like hey we're taking all the profits from it that's kind of like I almost wish they would just take them down instead you know what I mean it's kind of a little weird mm-hmm

999
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:17,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

1000
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:23,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the thing I was most surprised to learn from this whole story is that there's people that make livings off of doing Let's Play videos.

1001
01:20:23,331 --> 01:20:25,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea you could make that kind of money on YouTube.

1002
01:20:26,074 --> 01:20:27,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, wow, I'm in the wrong business.

1003
01:20:28,236 --> 01:20:31,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, I need to do some sassy Let's Play videos or something.

1004
01:20:31,579 --> 01:20:39,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I was joking with Rob saying that, hey, because I do monetize some of the videos I make for YouTube just...

1005
01:20:40,206 --> 01:20:47,113
[SPEAKER_05]: First hits and giggles because I know I'm not going to get millions of hits on it, but hey, let's just see what kind of money we'll rake in from this.

1006
01:20:47,874 --> 01:20:54,000
[SPEAKER_05]: With the few videos that I have, and a few of them have like a thousand views or something, a whopping 26 cents.

1007
01:20:55,421 --> 01:20:55,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1008
01:20:56,042 --> 01:20:56,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1009
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:57,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm retiring.

1010
01:20:58,144 --> 01:20:59,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Nintendo is evil for what they did?

1011
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:02,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's a good idea.

1012
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:15,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I understand that they're saying, oh, you guys shouldn't be making money off of our content, but it's less about making money off their content and more of just like it's commentary and stuff.

1013
01:21:15,096 --> 01:21:27,021
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't really do a Let's Play video or a commentary on gameplay without showing the gameplay, unless you have some sort of weird riff tracks thing that you do.

1014
01:21:27,601 --> 01:21:49,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a lot of anger directed at Nintendo on the internet this week over this whole thing and it's like okay to some extent I do get it and I feel I can understand where the YouTube community feels a little bit slighted on this and I can certainly understand hey this is the internet and we can just pick up and move it to somewhere else you know I'm sure there's a lot of that talk going on right now but you guys Microsoft did this in October of last year and

1015
01:21:50,680 --> 01:22:02,785
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I believe it was October 9th was the date the news went out is that Microsoft now they did something a little different, but they actually put it in their whole little terms of service that you cannot earn money from these games like Halo 4 and so forth.

1016
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:08,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And that if you cannot enroll in a YouTube partner program, if you are playing one of these Microsoft games.

1017
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:20,478
[SPEAKER_04]: but here's how that's I just think a lot of gamers forgot about that in their anger because everybody's like oh Nintendo's just doing this because the Wii U sucks and all this stuff and I'm like well Microsoft did the same fucking thing seven months ago does that mean the 360 sucks?

1018
01:22:20,738 --> 01:22:34,070
[SPEAKER_05]: but they do this they're doing this now and then and of course we don't know it's confirmed yet but the rumor is they're going to be kind of rolling out the same features that the PlayStation 4 has where you can share videos and gameplay and stuff

1019
01:22:35,671 --> 01:22:48,300
[SPEAKER_05]: If they have it where you can live stream and do commentary over that stuff, you're not going to be able to monetize those videos that you put out there even though they're making it super easy for you to do that.

1020
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:54,384
[SPEAKER_05]: They just want you to freely advertise their game without any sort of... That's the thing.

1021
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:56,065
[SPEAKER_05]: You're kind of advertising their game.

1022
01:22:56,105 --> 01:22:56,666
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you...

1023
01:22:57,466 --> 01:22:58,086
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1024
01:23:15,832 --> 01:23:19,674
[SPEAKER_04]: But those interactions were designed by Nintendo.

1025
01:23:20,414 --> 01:23:22,155
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the place I fault that argument.

1026
01:23:22,395 --> 01:23:23,856
[SPEAKER_05]: You want the word to get out of every game.

1027
01:23:23,896 --> 01:23:24,977
[SPEAKER_05]: You want your game to look fun.

1028
01:23:24,997 --> 01:23:25,997
[SPEAKER_05]: You want it to get out to the people.

1029
01:23:26,057 --> 01:23:31,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether they're seeing it like if I come over and watch someone playing a game, how's that any different than watching it over the internet?

1030
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:55,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying I necessarily disagree completely that Nintendo made a bad decision with this but I also think there's a lot of gamer entitlement going on here that you guys if it was a movie do you think I could put up a copy of Star Trek Into Darkness with my commentary on YouTube and not have that get struck down with probably something a lot worse than the monetary it would be a copyright strike

1031
01:23:56,470 --> 01:24:03,454
[SPEAKER_04]: If I were to put something up, you know who's really fucking crazy about their intellectual property is sports.

1032
01:24:03,815 --> 01:24:06,356
[SPEAKER_04]: The NBA and the NFL, especially the NFL.

1033
01:24:06,676 --> 01:24:13,101
[SPEAKER_04]: If I were to put up classic football clips and be talking over them and stuff, they would come after me, legally.

1034
01:24:13,221 --> 01:24:15,482
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be a lot worse than what Nintendo's doing here.

1035
01:24:16,463 --> 01:24:24,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think there's gamer entitlement going on here, and this is just a rude awakening, and I'm sorry, but I think gamers are getting it a lot better

1036
01:24:25,869 --> 01:24:50,099
[SPEAKER_05]: some of these other well Rob also keep in mind like for another example this is the Rift Tracks guys have to get licensing which and they don't even don't they just do their sales that they don't attach well they don't have to get licensing they only have to get licensing for when they're actually doing like a show like an actual movie in a theater with you know the Rift Tracks the most of the stuff they do is in the public domain now

1037
01:24:51,001 --> 01:24:52,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1038
01:25:08,155 --> 01:25:18,622
[SPEAKER_05]: People, the whole reason that you're having this share thing on the PlayStation 4 and stuff is to kind of, you want to share those moments with your friends and stuff like that.

1039
01:25:18,722 --> 01:25:26,446
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're going to start saying, okay, we want you to get that footage out there, get that footage out there, and then start hammering them down.

1040
01:25:26,587 --> 01:25:29,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I'm sorry, but that footage was too long.

1041
01:25:29,608 --> 01:25:32,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but you're trying to make some money off of this.

1042
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:47,498
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to be motivated to continue doing those Let's Play videos if they're going to make no money off of it because they're trying to put out content and if you're saying, well, you can't make any money off this, that's basically...

1043
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:54,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a little stretch, but it's almost like saying, we're telling you what you can and can't do with this game.

1044
01:25:54,496 --> 01:25:55,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, sorry, you can't sell it used.

1045
01:25:56,257 --> 01:25:57,657
[SPEAKER_05]: We're telling you what you can and can't do.

1046
01:25:57,797 --> 01:26:05,380
[SPEAKER_04]: In part, that's where I do agree with you, is that this wasn't a smart PR move on Nintendo's part on a time where they need a lot of good news.

1047
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:14,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what should happen here, and this is probably a limitation of YouTube, quite honestly, is that maybe there needs to be something where it's a split revenue stream or something like that.

1048
01:26:14,326 --> 01:26:24,373
[SPEAKER_04]: But, Loki, if people are making money, they're making a living off of Let's Play videos, that tells me, what, $40,000 a year minimum, right, to live off of.

1049
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:26,875
[SPEAKER_04]: You got maybe, in some parts of the country, $30,000 or less.

1050
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:27,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1051
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:32,419
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're talking, multiply that by how many people on YouTube are doing it for a living.

1052
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:32,419
50?

1053
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:33,179
[SPEAKER_04]: 100?

1054
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,179
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's...

1055
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of views.

1056
01:26:37,141 --> 01:26:39,043
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of views required.

1057
01:26:39,323 --> 01:26:41,444
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like thousands of views to get a penny.

1058
01:26:42,024 --> 01:26:42,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

1059
01:26:43,305 --> 01:26:48,268
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I'm going to look it up right now because I can look at my monetization and see what exactly I'm...

1060
01:26:50,589 --> 01:27:10,978
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing in I guess yeah but again you know I and I'm not dissing the talent of these individuals and they're funny witty stuff and so forth because that would be kind of biting the hand that you know makes up this show here but uh then again we're not displaying images of the game in motion the whole time during the during the show or whatever I don't know I don't know

1061
01:27:11,718 --> 01:27:15,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's stupid though that they... We're also not trying to make a living off of it.

1062
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:28,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the problem too is they basically say, okay, yeah, we're going to have this partnership program that we're going to partner with IGN or something like that or Machinima or something like that.

1063
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:46,245
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you have to become an affiliate with them but they may not let you become an affiliate with them so once again you're given these big guys how's an indie supposed to shine if you're just saying sorry you can't show any of our gameplay we only want IGN to show our gameplay find another way to monetize it

1064
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:49,584
[SPEAKER_05]: But how do you do that?

1065
01:27:50,325 --> 01:27:52,047
[SPEAKER_04]: If I knew, I would have the money.

1066
01:27:52,107 --> 01:27:59,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying, though, that if there's another way to monetize it, they're going to still hit you for the same thing, that you're making money off of our videos or off our content.

1067
01:28:00,938 --> 01:28:05,263
[SPEAKER_05]: What if it's like PayPal donations or something like that for a Twitch stream or something?

1068
01:28:05,723 --> 01:28:11,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure people make money off of that, but I don't know.

1069
01:28:11,867 --> 01:28:25,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if there's going to be a standardized way that people are going to make money off of videos, whether it be monetization via ads or whatever, maybe they can cater those ads for those Nintendo videos to Nintendo products.

1070
01:28:26,617 --> 01:28:27,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

1071
01:28:27,258 --> 01:28:28,739
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems to make more sense to me.

1072
01:28:29,028 --> 01:28:41,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do think, again, I think the smarter thing for Nintendo to do would have been to partner with these people to come to a solution that has both people in mind.

1073
01:28:41,617 --> 01:28:46,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Either it's split revenue or it's ads that support Nintendo or whatever it is.

1074
01:28:46,241 --> 01:28:49,243
[SPEAKER_04]: But by putting the hammer down, they made themselves look like dicks.

1075
01:28:49,603 --> 01:28:52,706
[SPEAKER_04]: But my point is they are well within their legal right to do so.

1076
01:28:52,966 --> 01:28:55,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think people need to...

1077
01:28:55,948 --> 01:28:57,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Give Nintendo a little bit of a break here.

1078
01:28:58,090 --> 01:29:04,354
[SPEAKER_04]: When you hear about that people are making a living off of this, Nintendo is entitled to some of that money.

1079
01:29:04,434 --> 01:29:05,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm rolling the money.

1080
01:29:05,374 --> 01:29:07,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I just made 7 more cents.

1081
01:29:07,576 --> 01:29:08,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at 31 cents.

1082
01:29:09,817 --> 01:29:12,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a good example right here.

1083
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:24,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the videos I've been uploading, like different Ouya videos and stuff like that, the one that I have the most views on so far is a how to sideload apps tutorial, I guess.

1084
01:29:24,667 --> 01:29:25,468
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only a few minutes long.

1085
01:29:26,108 --> 01:29:35,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I have 2,170 views, 6,977 minutes, 24 cents is what I've made off of that.

1086
01:29:35,751 --> 01:29:38,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to give you an idea of how many views you're going to get.

1087
01:29:38,952 --> 01:29:43,534
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to get millions and millions of views combined over your channel.

1088
01:29:43,694 --> 01:29:44,874
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take a lot of work.

1089
01:29:46,075 --> 01:29:49,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody putting out a Let's Play video is not going to make...

1090
01:29:50,496 --> 01:29:52,819
[SPEAKER_05]: A ton of money, and they really want that ad money?

1091
01:29:53,019 --> 01:29:54,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really?

1092
01:29:54,461 --> 01:29:59,907
[SPEAKER_05]: You want that, like, maybe a buck that they're gonna make if they get thousands of views?

1093
01:30:00,047 --> 01:30:00,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously?

1094
01:30:01,609 --> 01:30:02,830
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems a little greedy.

1095
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:06,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, going to a couple more chat comments here, and then we gotta move on with the show.

1096
01:30:06,034 --> 01:30:07,035
[SPEAKER_04]: But SSJ100Matt says...

1097
01:30:07,355 --> 01:30:10,157
[SPEAKER_04]: ShadowNextGen says, The people who make these videos might take a few hours to make them.

1098
01:30:10,437 --> 01:30:15,480
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have the right to make money off of the new Zelda title that Nintendo took years and millions of dollars to make.

1099
01:30:38,991 --> 01:30:51,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but look at what kind of money is Nintendo making off their title versus the amount of effort Nintendo's putting into their title versus the return versus the person that spent like an hour to make a video and his return.

1100
01:30:51,921 --> 01:30:55,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's fair because you look at the amount of money that they're making.

1101
01:30:55,643 --> 01:30:59,706
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like the guy that's making the Let's Play video is making more money than Nintendo on these titles.

1102
01:31:00,147 --> 01:31:05,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I just don't see where Nintendo is necessarily losing money on this.

1103
01:31:05,671 --> 01:31:08,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they suggesting that people are watching these Let's Plays and going...

1104
01:31:08,733 --> 01:31:09,794
[SPEAKER_05]: That's enough of that game.

1105
01:31:09,894 --> 01:31:10,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to buy it now.

1106
01:31:11,256 --> 01:31:11,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1107
01:31:11,596 --> 01:31:13,979
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just like saying, oh, hey, someone pirated our game.

1108
01:31:13,999 --> 01:31:14,699
[SPEAKER_05]: We lost the sale.

1109
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,462
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't attribute that.

1110
01:31:17,822 --> 01:31:21,466
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no data to correlate lost sales.

1111
01:31:21,606 --> 01:31:27,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Make all the excuses you want, but the fact of the matter is your system's not selling well because you don't have any games on it.

1112
01:31:27,832 --> 01:31:34,857
[SPEAKER_04]: MM2K says, YouTube just needs to establish a standard fee against revenue of anyone using copyrighted material, maybe 5-10%.

1113
01:31:35,777 --> 01:31:49,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Again though, I mean, I'm with you on that for like games, but like movies, I can't post a copy of Star Trek Into Darkness on YouTube and expect that, you know, oh Paramount gets 5-10% because I'm giving my sassy commentary over this movie that just came out.

1114
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:49,806
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

1115
01:31:51,968 --> 01:31:52,088
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

1116
01:31:52,828 --> 01:31:54,129
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be something there.

1117
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:57,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what needs to happen, and this is, I think, would be, this would be fun.

1118
01:31:58,332 --> 01:32:03,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo needs to be one of those companies, like Mojang, with Minecraft, saying, hey, you know what?

1119
01:32:04,857 --> 01:32:11,963
[SPEAKER_05]: We're cool with you putting the videos out there and, you know, do with whatever, but if you monetize our videos, then maybe that they...

1120
01:32:12,563 --> 01:32:12,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1121
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:32,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be fair enough because they're getting their products out there and they're advertised.

1122
01:32:33,212 --> 01:32:42,577
[SPEAKER_05]: The people are more inclined to put out these videos to spread the word about these Nintendo games.

1123
01:32:44,038 --> 01:32:48,220
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if I haven't played New Super Mario Bros.

1124
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:51,481
[SPEAKER_05]: U and I watch some Let's Play videos, I'm like, hey, that looks like a pretty fun game.

1125
01:32:51,762 --> 01:32:52,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I should go buy it.

1126
01:32:54,289 --> 01:33:00,353
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to try to get these people not to put these videos out there, I'm never going to hear about this game.

1127
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:14,582
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought on this whole thing is that, again, although Nintendo maybe didn't have the best timing with this sort of move, this is not something that's going to be limited to Nintendo, and it is not limited to Nintendo.

1128
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:15,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Microsoft did it.

1129
01:33:15,802 --> 01:33:19,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega did it with the whole Shining Force or something.

1130
01:33:19,545 --> 01:33:21,546
[SPEAKER_04]: This one random game, they were taking down all these videos.

1131
01:33:22,427 --> 01:33:34,437
[SPEAKER_04]: This is still a new media that a lot of companies are exploring, and I'm sorry, but if you are just using this to further your Nintendo hate boner, you need to spread the hate around equally.

1132
01:33:34,717 --> 01:33:38,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Your position needs to be the same for all these companies that are doing it.

1133
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:45,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of one of my big things with this, is that at least if you're going to be mad, be mad at everybody.

1134
01:33:46,963 --> 01:33:52,847
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on and do one more story here before the classic game of the week.

1135
01:33:53,407 --> 01:33:55,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And hooray, it's a porn story.

1136
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:56,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1137
01:33:56,309 --> 01:33:57,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids like porn.

1138
01:33:57,410 --> 01:33:58,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1139
01:33:59,491 --> 01:33:59,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

1140
01:34:00,312 --> 01:34:03,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardcore pornography apparently coming to the next Xbox.

1141
01:34:03,794 --> 01:34:05,515
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what the headlines all say.

1142
01:34:05,735 --> 01:34:06,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1143
01:34:06,136 --> 01:34:07,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what it's really about.

1144
01:34:07,376 --> 01:34:07,657
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1145
01:34:08,037 --> 01:34:09,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Sugar DVD.

1146
01:34:09,758 --> 01:34:13,941
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they do films like Hairy Asian Schoolgirls Masturbate.

1147
01:34:14,241 --> 01:34:14,841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a thing.

1148
01:34:14,861 --> 01:34:15,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1149
01:34:16,082 --> 01:34:18,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's just a made up title.

1150
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:32,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Outro Music

1151
01:34:58,914 --> 01:35:02,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there really a porn called Don't Tell My Wife I Ass Fucked the Babysitter?

1152
01:35:03,436 --> 01:35:04,517
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty great parody.

1153
01:35:04,957 --> 01:35:06,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead.

1154
01:35:06,898 --> 01:35:08,219
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like a little parody on that.

1155
01:35:08,759 --> 01:35:09,960
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds hilarious.

1156
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:11,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's actually a real porn.

1157
01:35:12,161 --> 01:35:12,761
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1158
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:16,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you'll find out on the new Xbox very soon.

1159
01:35:17,224 --> 01:35:19,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the quote from SugarDVD's Rebecca Bolin.

1160
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:25,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Any console would benefit from having unlimited HD adult content at the click of a button.

1161
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:29,791
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, did you hear that?

1162
01:35:29,871 --> 01:35:31,252
[SPEAKER_04]: All you gotta do is click your mouse.

1163
01:35:32,632 --> 01:35:34,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1164
01:35:36,094 --> 01:35:36,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1165
01:35:36,334 --> 01:35:37,775
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Rob, that does exist.

1166
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:38,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked it up.

1167
01:35:38,776 --> 01:35:39,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an actual, yes.

1168
01:35:41,137 --> 01:35:42,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say, they have a lot of them.

1169
01:35:43,311 --> 01:35:45,232
[SPEAKER_07]: My search history is hilarious.

1170
01:35:45,392 --> 01:35:47,134
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that one New Year's Eve?

1171
01:35:47,194 --> 01:36:03,444
[SPEAKER_04]: It was got to be 2006 or 2007 where we were looking up the pornography on the Nintendo Wii web browser and looking at what like Xtube and we found the pterodactyl porn which was a guy in a pterodactyl suit having sex with some girl and it was hilarious.

1172
01:36:04,245 --> 01:36:06,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the little motions the guy would make.

1173
01:36:06,366 --> 01:36:12,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we were trying to look up for some reason we were looking up donkey punch and there was a guy dressed up like a donkey.

1174
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:13,211
[SPEAKER_04]: That would actually punch, yeah.

1175
01:36:14,191 --> 01:36:38,796
[SPEAKER_04]: hilarious when in doubt more porn stories all right let's uh let's travel to a time when you know you know a porn game porn on the console was Custer's Revenge and Bubble Bath Babes and Miss Nude World 96 that was that was porn in gaming it's the classic game of the week where DarkSakura is going to walk into her classic gaming vault and she can do that tonight she's literally right there

1176
01:36:39,396 --> 01:36:44,641
[SPEAKER_04]: and find a game that she says, hey, you kids should be playing this game, damn it.

1177
01:36:45,122 --> 01:36:50,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't think she picked a porno game, so don't get too excited, but DarkSakura picked something just as good as a porno.

1178
01:36:50,687 --> 01:36:51,668
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the classic game of the week?

1179
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:59,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Today's classic game is Hagane, The Final Conflict, which is not a game that came out widespread in America.

1180
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,718
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of those blockbuster-only games like Final Fight Guy.

1181
01:37:04,053 --> 01:37:05,614
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is a game I do not own.

1182
01:37:06,395 --> 01:37:09,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to own it, however, it is $700 on eBay right now.

1183
01:37:10,117 --> 01:37:10,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy moly.

1184
01:37:11,318 --> 01:37:12,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm not even joking.

1185
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get some of the audio from the game here.

1186
01:37:17,474 --> 01:37:21,558
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out in 1994, and it's a side-scrolling action game.

1187
01:37:22,599 --> 01:37:27,624
[SPEAKER_07]: It was developed by Keita Amemiya and Red Entertainment.

1188
01:37:27,664 --> 01:37:29,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost said Redertainment, you know, one of our listeners.

1189
01:37:31,087 --> 01:37:32,088
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Red Entertainment.

1190
01:37:32,148 --> 01:37:34,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It was published by Hudson Soft for the Super Nintendo.

1191
01:37:35,511 --> 01:37:39,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, in the US, it was only one of those blockbuster video games.

1192
01:37:40,518 --> 01:37:44,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I do have the other blockbuster game, Final Fight Guy.

1193
01:37:44,985 --> 01:37:45,505
[SPEAKER_07]: That one goes for 300.

1194
01:37:48,257 --> 01:38:01,145
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, the story behind this is that the Huma and Koma ninja clans are basically in a big rivalry against each other for the Holy Grail.

1195
01:38:02,266 --> 01:38:05,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Huma clan is based off of the Chinese Zodiac.

1196
01:38:05,267 --> 01:38:16,234
[SPEAKER_07]: And you play this one guy who is in full armor and Dan and I, when Dan was playing because we have a version of it quote version

1197
01:38:17,615 --> 01:38:18,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Amulator.

1198
01:38:19,316 --> 01:38:19,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1199
01:38:20,037 --> 01:38:20,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Amulator.

1200
01:38:21,138 --> 01:38:22,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1201
01:38:22,659 --> 01:38:28,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan was talking about some of the resemblance to Strider.

1202
01:38:28,965 --> 01:38:31,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, you love this game because it's freaking Strider.

1203
01:38:31,847 --> 01:38:33,429
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Strider ripoff.

1204
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:35,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if Dan likes anything Strider or Strider related.

1205
01:38:35,931 --> 01:38:38,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Strider meets Shinobi is what I'm looking at here.

1206
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:39,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1207
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:46,362
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is actually a game I would... I don't even care if it's just the Super Famicom version, which is still like 50 bucks on eBay here.

1208
01:38:47,442 --> 01:38:51,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to have this game, but the big problem about it is that it's freaking hard!

1209
01:38:52,064 --> 01:38:53,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Super hard, and no save.

1210
01:38:54,885 --> 01:38:56,545
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why emulators are awesome.

1211
01:38:58,346 --> 01:38:59,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Save states.

1212
01:39:00,646 --> 01:39:06,868
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically, you're playing as a ninja cyborg.

1213
01:39:07,552 --> 01:39:09,694
[SPEAKER_07]: who is going to kill all of the Koma clan.

1214
01:39:09,834 --> 01:39:10,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Rawr.

1215
01:39:11,556 --> 01:39:18,481
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, basically it's just a really, really cool side-scrolling game.

1216
01:39:18,722 --> 01:39:19,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Very difficult.

1217
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:27,269
[SPEAKER_07]: But one thing that it did get some less-than-stellar reviews on was actually its graphics.

1218
01:39:27,389 --> 01:39:31,913
[SPEAKER_07]: It was said not to show off the best of Super Nintendo at the time.

1219
01:39:34,008 --> 01:39:38,130
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't think Hagane is on Virtual Console.

1220
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:50,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sort of... It wasn't really, I mean, considering it was only released to video stores or whatever, it wasn't really... I mean, we haven't seen Final Fight Guy.

1221
01:39:50,616 --> 01:39:50,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1222
01:39:51,556 --> 01:39:54,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, this was a very limited release.

1223
01:39:54,678 --> 01:39:57,259
[SPEAKER_07]: You could only rent this game at Blockbuster.

1224
01:39:57,279 --> 01:39:57,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1225
01:39:58,078 --> 01:40:06,064
[SPEAKER_04]: and then, like I said... Hold on, EricRPG in our chatroom says that they had it at his video store, so it may not have just been Blockbuster, but maybe, like, video stores in general.

1226
01:40:06,884 --> 01:40:09,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, these were actually released only for Blockbuster.

1227
01:40:09,967 --> 01:40:13,109
[SPEAKER_07]: If they showed up at other video stores, then they were purchased from Blockbuster.

1228
01:40:13,429 --> 01:40:13,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, weird.

1229
01:40:13,949 --> 01:40:14,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1230
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:14,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1231
01:40:15,951 --> 01:40:22,736
[SPEAKER_07]: So, because Blockbuster had, like, a limited release deal just on certain Japanese-only games.

1232
01:40:23,076 --> 01:40:23,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1233
01:40:25,868 --> 01:40:27,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was one of them.

1234
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:30,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, I would love to have this game in my collection.

1235
01:40:30,993 --> 01:40:32,394
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, really difficult.

1236
01:40:32,714 --> 01:40:35,336
[SPEAKER_07]: But a very rich, good side-scrolling game.

1237
01:40:37,358 --> 01:40:41,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't say fucking Blockbuster because Blockbuster is dead, pretty much.

1238
01:40:42,463 --> 01:40:44,184
[SPEAKER_07]: The one around the corner from my house is gone.

1239
01:40:44,224 --> 01:40:45,105
[SPEAKER_07]: They are vanishing.

1240
01:40:45,405 --> 01:40:50,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw one in a strip mall the other day and I was like, oh my god, it's a museum.

1241
01:40:51,724 --> 01:40:52,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1242
01:40:53,405 --> 01:40:56,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's where I picked up a copy of Parappa 2.

1243
01:40:58,509 --> 01:41:01,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I'm checking on eBay right now.

1244
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:02,371
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one for $295.

1245
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:02,892
[SPEAKER_07]: One for a buy it now of $700.

1246
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:05,193
[SPEAKER_07]: And another one without the box for $400.

1247
01:41:05,233 --> 01:41:06,014
[SPEAKER_07]: A Japanese copy is $45.

1248
01:41:06,114 --> 01:41:07,175
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't even care.

1249
01:41:07,195 --> 01:41:07,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

1250
01:41:18,154 --> 01:41:18,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Haganay

1251
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:34,331
[SPEAKER_04]: for the Super Nintendo.

1252
01:41:34,391 --> 01:41:35,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck finding it.

1253
01:41:35,732 --> 01:41:38,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and if you find it, give it to me.

1254
01:41:39,055 --> 01:41:39,516
[SPEAKER_04]: As a tip.

1255
01:41:40,257 --> 01:41:41,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because you love me.

1256
01:41:42,279 --> 01:41:45,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lawn Tradio, but don't go anywhere.

1257
01:41:45,782 --> 01:41:50,747
[SPEAKER_04]: We have plenty more to come, including the Fugle Question of the Week, all about this controversial Nintendo Let's Play topic.

1258
01:41:51,427 --> 01:41:53,528
[SPEAKER_04]: More stories about EA and Nintendo.

1259
01:41:53,788 --> 01:41:58,471
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk a little bit about the stuff from the Google press thing this week that has to do with Nintendo.

1260
01:41:59,011 --> 01:42:06,955
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple E3 stories for you guys and plenty more including your phone calls and emails when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1261
01:42:15,131 --> 01:42:15,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there!

1262
01:42:16,553 --> 01:42:23,420
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Redertainment, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1263
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:30,067
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to use my voice to tell you that Garrus ain't got nothing on Samantha Trainor.

1264
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:32,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Shots fired.

1265
01:42:32,998 --> 01:42:33,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out, DarkSakura.

1266
01:42:34,018 --> 01:42:34,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Shots fired.

1267
01:42:34,518 --> 01:42:34,798
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1268
01:42:36,839 --> 01:42:37,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Live.

1269
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:43,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 505 in progress.

1270
01:42:43,581 --> 01:42:47,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to Red Entertainment for starting shit here on the second half of our show.

1271
01:42:47,222 --> 01:42:47,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate that.

1272
01:42:47,903 --> 01:42:54,005
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to leave a bumper for our show, more information available in our forum at the VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com.

1273
01:42:54,265 --> 01:42:55,425
[SPEAKER_04]: We're finally getting a few of them in.

1274
01:42:55,465 --> 01:42:57,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I have another new one to play next week, so thanks to you guys.

1275
01:42:58,206 --> 01:42:58,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Dance 4

1276
01:43:22,222 --> 01:43:23,503
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1277
01:43:47,405 --> 01:43:53,652
[SPEAKER_04]: But I gotta say, I really like, especially in Just Dance 4, well, A, the song list is very, like, what the fuck?

1278
01:43:53,772 --> 01:44:05,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there's some really, like, you know, they have the stuff you'd expect to hear, like some top 40 hits, like J-Lo on the floor, and Pink, So What, but then, like, there's these picks, they have a cover of the Time Warp

1279
01:44:06,847 --> 01:44:07,127
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1280
01:44:07,508 --> 01:44:08,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which is hilarious.

1281
01:44:09,029 --> 01:44:11,551
[SPEAKER_04]: They have Army of Lovers with Crucified.

1282
01:44:11,571 --> 01:44:12,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys remember that song.

1283
01:44:12,872 --> 01:44:13,412
[SPEAKER_04]: You love that song.

1284
01:44:13,432 --> 01:44:14,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that song?

1285
01:44:15,774 --> 01:44:18,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, Google that music video.

1286
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:19,317
[SPEAKER_04]: It is hilarious.

1287
01:44:19,357 --> 01:44:20,498
[SPEAKER_04]: That song is in the game.

1288
01:44:20,518 --> 01:44:21,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have a video?

1289
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1290
01:44:41,238 --> 01:44:50,940
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really like that they have these full workout modes where it'll actually do like a kind of like a warm up little like, you know, generic electro beat or whatever you pick.

1291
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:53,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll do a bunch of songs and you do like a cool down.

1292
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:56,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So it actually the way it think it's not just a bunch of songs on shuffle counting the calories.

1293
01:44:56,981 --> 01:44:57,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool.

1294
01:44:57,421 --> 01:44:58,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that I really liked.

1295
01:44:58,882 --> 01:45:01,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So for 20 bucks, I was very happy with that.

1296
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:05,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that was a game I forgot to mention earlier.

1297
01:45:05,523 --> 01:45:05,943
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1298
01:45:07,419 --> 01:45:09,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we can get into some rapid-fire news now, if you want.

1299
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:10,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1300
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:23,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So the folks behind The Incredible Machine, which I sunk a lot of hours into back for one of my first computer games, they are making... I love that game, by the way.

1301
01:45:23,585 --> 01:45:24,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's fantastic.

1302
01:45:25,025 --> 01:45:28,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, what do they call those, the Rube Goldberg machines or whatever?

1303
01:45:29,387 --> 01:45:35,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Which reminds me, or as everybody knows it, the opening sequence to Pee-Wee's Big Adventure with the Mr. T cereal.

1304
01:45:35,669 --> 01:45:35,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1305
01:45:36,349 --> 01:45:37,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pitiful, they don't eat my cereal

1306
01:46:06,939 --> 01:46:07,399
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

1307
01:46:07,739 --> 01:46:09,081
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they'll be coming out.

1308
01:46:09,761 --> 01:46:12,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably have to pick that up because I love the Incredible Machine.

1309
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is also cool.

1310
01:46:14,645 --> 01:46:17,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Another Kickstarter game called Auto Duel.

1311
01:46:18,168 --> 01:46:20,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a multiplayer car combat game.

1312
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:26,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So probably it's a good thing that David Jeff has signed on to help...

1313
01:46:27,936 --> 01:46:35,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Make This Game, and on top of that, Zach Norman, the creator of Interstate 76 and Vigilante 8.

1314
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:42,982
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I think he created Vigilante 8, but Vigilante 8, one of my most favorite car combat games.

1315
01:46:43,423 --> 01:46:48,605
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty good pedigree right there, so looking forward to that, maybe back that when that comes out.

1316
01:46:51,866 --> 01:46:57,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know if they've actually released or have this out yet as a Kickstarter.

1317
01:46:57,707 --> 01:46:58,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably soon, though.

1318
01:46:59,428 --> 01:47:04,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And last but not least, the Assassin's Creed movie has a date, or at least a time frame.

1319
01:47:04,649 --> 01:47:05,089
[SPEAKER_05]: May 2015.

1320
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:10,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I also saw it was July 2016, beginning of the Angry Birds movie.

1321
01:47:10,551 --> 01:47:14,832
[SPEAKER_05]: By then, I don't think Angry Birds will be a thing anymore, or at least anyone will care.

1322
01:47:15,052 --> 01:47:15,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1323
01:47:15,692 --> 01:47:17,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, it's... We can all hope.

1324
01:47:18,773 --> 01:47:19,233
[SPEAKER_04]: A long time.

1325
01:47:20,374 --> 01:47:26,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, before I get to my rapid-fire stories here, DarkSakura, I see you chatting like crazy in our chatroom tonight.

1326
01:47:26,318 --> 01:47:27,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I read that right?

1327
01:47:27,239 --> 01:47:33,584
[SPEAKER_04]: You said, had I not romanced Garrus in all 17 times, you've beaten Mass Effect.

1328
01:47:34,544 --> 01:47:35,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's more than 17.

1329
01:47:36,085 --> 01:47:36,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I just made up a number.

1330
01:47:37,226 --> 01:47:38,727
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have a problem.

1331
01:47:39,448 --> 01:47:40,709
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't.

1332
01:47:41,209 --> 01:47:41,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I've...

1333
01:47:44,026 --> 01:47:46,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1334
01:48:07,495 --> 01:48:08,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Justify, Justify

1335
01:48:31,272 --> 01:48:31,773
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1336
01:48:31,833 --> 01:48:33,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go play some Japanese Sonic Adventure.

1337
01:48:34,015 --> 01:48:35,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Sonic CD.

1338
01:48:36,357 --> 01:48:37,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to spite Bobby.

1339
01:48:37,578 --> 01:48:39,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll livestream that shit.

1340
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,902
[SPEAKER_04]: You have fun with that while I read the news about yet another Kickstarter.

1341
01:48:42,943 --> 01:48:44,144
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the world we live in, guys.

1342
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:45,184
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is a really cool band.

1343
01:48:45,205 --> 01:48:46,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of you like these guys.

1344
01:48:47,066 --> 01:48:49,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Anna Managucci, the chiptune artist.

1345
01:48:49,907 --> 01:48:54,289
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a Kickstarter of their own up for Endless Fantasy.

1346
01:48:54,529 --> 01:49:01,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're very proud of the fact that they've completed this 22-track album over three years without any help from a label, to which I say, you guys go.

1347
01:49:01,793 --> 01:49:02,353
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1348
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:05,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And the goal for this, getting the CD out there, $50,000.

1349
01:49:05,634 --> 01:49:05,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1350
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:11,038
[SPEAKER_04]: They're sitting just under 200k right now, so safe to say they've met it.

1351
01:49:11,438 --> 01:49:21,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Now with 13 days still to go, so if you pay, I believe, 15 or more, you get the CD pre-order of Endless Fantasy and you get the digital download with that.

1352
01:49:21,985 --> 01:49:27,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we have some of their tracks in rotation on VOG and great chiptune artists, so congrats guys.

1353
01:49:29,311 --> 01:49:32,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this game would make $200,000, but it's sure worth a shot.

1354
01:49:33,073 --> 01:49:36,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Shaq Fighter is apparently a name that has been trademarked.

1355
01:49:36,775 --> 01:49:41,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, I'm sure you all remember Shaq Fu, which is what, on Super Nintendo and Genesis, I think as well?

1356
01:49:42,158 --> 01:49:52,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it was the fighting game that starred Shaq, and it's kind of a cult game, but it's one of those games that everybody's like, oh yeah, I remember Shaq Fu, and then you actually play it, and you're like, oh yeah, I remember Shaq Fu.

1357
01:49:52,905 --> 01:49:55,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was also Shackdown, which was a mobile game.

1358
01:49:56,047 --> 01:49:56,787
[SPEAKER_04]: They came out with that.

1359
01:49:57,107 --> 01:50:09,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now apparently the folks that run the Shack.com website, which I didn't even know existed until now, they registered to trademark for Shack Fighter on May 8th.

1360
01:50:09,734 --> 01:50:11,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if this is yet another mobile game.

1361
01:50:12,256 --> 01:50:16,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this is the Wii U's killer app that's going to get everybody to buy the console.

1362
01:50:16,878 --> 01:50:36,031
[SPEAKER_04]: or maybe it's another mobile game or maybe it's another like attempt at a 50 cent blood in the sand Shaq goes after terrorists perhaps perhaps I don't know but hey Shaq's pretty pretty awesome so this is gonna be it's gonna be worth checking out if nothing else before the lulls

1363
01:50:38,092 --> 01:50:41,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Wave Forward, who did the game's Adventure Time.

1364
01:50:41,673 --> 01:50:43,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ice King, why'd you steal our garbage?

1365
01:50:43,813 --> 01:50:53,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, DuckTailed Remastered, which had everybody screaming like a little girl at PAX East, is going to be doing another Adventure Time game.

1366
01:50:54,116 --> 01:50:58,077
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Adventure Time Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know.

1367
01:51:00,498 --> 01:51:01,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Adventure Time.

1368
01:51:01,897 --> 01:51:05,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is pretty much, you know, any video game ever, right?

1369
01:51:05,799 --> 01:51:06,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Explore the dungeon.

1370
01:51:06,899 --> 01:51:07,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1371
01:51:07,299 --> 01:51:08,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't know.

1372
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:13,201
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be exploring the secret royal dungeon underneath the Candy Kingdom.

1373
01:51:13,381 --> 01:51:16,643
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, you can play as Finn, Jake, Marceline, and more.

1374
01:51:16,983 --> 01:51:18,223
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be co-op as well.

1375
01:51:18,323 --> 01:51:22,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be out Wii U, 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and 3DS.

1376
01:51:22,745 --> 01:51:25,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually kind of excited about it because the last game was only 3DS.

1377
01:51:25,086 --> 01:51:26,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, 3DS and DS.

1378
01:51:28,189 --> 01:51:57,025
[SPEAKER_04]: also happening regular show uh Mordecai and Rigby in 8-bit land on the 3ds uh they are Mordecai Mordecai excuse me I don't I don't know this show should I is it really funny it's supposed to be very funny I know Adventure Time I know that one if you like Adventure Time you'd like this show okay is it one of those things that's like funnier if you've you know smoked a certain substance beforehand uh I think it's just the same type of humor okay then yes uh okay so um don't do drugs kids

1379
01:51:57,926 --> 01:52:01,907
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, of course I meant smoking a hookah, which is perfectly legal.

1380
01:52:03,467 --> 01:52:04,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoking meat.

1381
01:52:04,488 --> 01:52:04,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1382
01:52:05,908 --> 01:52:07,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a water.

1383
01:52:07,708 --> 01:52:07,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1384
01:52:07,989 --> 01:52:08,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoking water.

1385
01:52:08,809 --> 01:52:09,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a water bong.

1386
01:52:09,749 --> 01:52:10,269
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I meant.

1387
01:52:11,249 --> 01:52:17,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, so as that name would talk about, the heroes will be transported inside your favorite games.

1388
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:21,072
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much what you'd expect in an episode of a regular show anyway.

1389
01:52:21,132 --> 01:52:23,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's 8-bit land for the 3DS.

1390
01:52:23,832 --> 01:52:26,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they already have a game on iOS, which most...

1391
01:52:27,398 --> 01:52:29,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of assume that everything has a game on IS.

1392
01:52:30,702 --> 01:52:31,143
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1393
01:52:31,303 --> 01:52:33,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, I like the show.

1394
01:52:33,126 --> 01:52:35,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots and lots of 80s references.

1395
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:40,034
[SPEAKER_04]: QueenSimi on our chatroom says, regular show is more of a stoner hipster show.

1396
01:52:40,175 --> 01:52:41,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like I thought.

1397
01:52:41,176 --> 01:52:41,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1398
01:52:41,516 --> 01:52:41,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1399
01:52:41,737 --> 01:52:42,698
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1400
01:52:43,530 --> 01:52:43,950
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

1401
01:53:01,581 --> 01:53:02,442
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to guess what it is.

1402
01:53:02,502 --> 01:53:02,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

1403
01:53:03,803 --> 01:53:10,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Disney has registered some domains that means that they might be doing some type of racing game.

1404
01:53:11,108 --> 01:53:18,454
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Disney Speedster, Disney Speedsters, Disney Racers, Disney Racing, Disney Kart, Disney Kart Racing, and Disney Karting.

1405
01:53:21,529 --> 01:53:25,312
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually have a Disney Speedsters Twitter with no tweets on it yet.

1406
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:29,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So, not surprising, Disney has their fingers in most things.

1407
01:53:30,295 --> 01:53:33,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, there is Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventure.

1408
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:40,523
[SPEAKER_07]: This is basically, it makes me think a lot of Pac-Land.

1409
01:53:41,604 --> 01:53:42,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember?

1410
01:53:43,503 --> 01:53:53,976
[SPEAKER_07]: But like on a 3D scale and it's basically Pac-Man wandering around in a 3D world It looks neat It's also based off a new TV show What?

1411
01:53:54,357 --> 01:53:55,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep What?

1412
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:59,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I need to go back and watch 80s Pac-Man cartoons

1413
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:17,460
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, last but not least, Google did a tribute to Atari's Breakout by having, if you type in Atari Breakout into the Google Images search, you will find your screen turned into a Breakout clone.

1414
01:54:19,841 --> 01:54:21,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Another little Google Easter egg.

1415
01:54:22,523 --> 01:54:22,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1416
01:54:23,483 --> 01:54:27,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I super, super loved what Google did for Saw Bass's birthday.

1417
01:54:28,616 --> 01:54:29,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that.

1418
01:54:29,756 --> 01:54:38,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I just kept watching it over and over again and then I had to watch It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World because that man is like my hero.

1419
01:54:38,979 --> 01:54:39,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sad he's dead.

1420
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:41,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you still play the Pac-Man?

1421
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the Pac-Man thing they did was legendary.

1422
01:54:44,221 --> 01:54:45,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you still play that?

1423
01:54:45,422 --> 01:54:46,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I can find out.

1424
01:54:46,302 --> 01:54:49,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they leave that up on the internet somewhere where you can still play that?

1425
01:54:50,363 --> 01:54:50,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1426
01:54:51,524 --> 01:54:51,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1427
01:54:53,484 --> 01:54:53,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1428
01:54:53,884 --> 01:54:55,445
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I will put the link into the chat room.

1429
01:54:56,144 --> 01:54:57,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the Foogle question of the week.

1430
01:55:19,349 --> 01:55:22,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Take Facebook and Google and slam them together, you get Foogle.

1431
01:55:23,012 --> 01:55:28,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And every week we ask a question in our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities and read some of our favorite answers.

1432
01:55:29,156 --> 01:55:33,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am going to have to limit how much I read tonight, guys, because there's just so many long answers.

1433
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:36,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I do want the show to be over in a reasonable amount of time tonight.

1434
01:55:37,322 --> 01:55:39,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize in advance if I don't read yours.

1435
01:55:39,704 --> 01:55:42,166
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will start on Google Plus tonight.

1436
01:55:42,566 --> 01:55:44,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to read this from Travis H.,

1437
01:55:45,488 --> 01:55:52,576
[SPEAKER_04]: with the majority of the gaming world hating on their new console and a lead developer from EA coming out last week calling the system crap.

1438
01:55:52,696 --> 01:55:54,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't even read the damn question, did I?

1439
01:55:54,337 --> 01:55:54,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1440
01:55:54,958 --> 01:56:01,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I said it was going to be about the Nintendo Let's Play thing, but let me read to you what I said for the communities.

1441
01:56:02,305 --> 01:56:04,447
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on Let's Play videos?

1442
01:56:04,547 --> 01:56:05,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like to watch them?

1443
01:56:05,848 --> 01:56:07,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you someone that creates them?

1444
01:56:07,690 --> 01:56:10,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, how do you feel about the news story itself?

1445
01:56:10,572 --> 01:56:17,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Has it soured your opinion on Nintendo or do you think they were well within their rights to make money off their game images?

1446
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:20,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And I link to the story that Loki talked about earlier in the show.

1447
01:56:21,121 --> 01:56:25,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so now going back to Travis H's answer over on Google+.

1448
01:56:25,663 --> 01:56:35,909
[SPEAKER_04]: With the majority of the gaming world hating on their new console and a lead developer from EA coming out last week calling the system crap, I feel like the big N needs all the help and gamer love they can get.

1449
01:56:36,369 --> 01:56:38,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I own a Wii U and a 3DS.

1450
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:40,690
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, Nintendo is failing miserably.

1451
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:47,352
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to focus more on making some damn games for the Wii U and stop bitching about free advertisement and promotion of their games.

1452
01:56:47,892 --> 01:56:56,035
[SPEAKER_04]: As for the content and spoiler aspect of the videos, if you don't want the game content spoiled for yourself, here is a novel idea.

1453
01:56:56,435 --> 01:56:57,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't watch.

1454
01:56:57,655 --> 01:56:59,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag wake up Nintendo.

1455
01:57:00,616 --> 01:57:04,318
[SPEAKER_04]: and that is a very similar thing that I've read on many places on the internet this week.

1456
01:57:05,478 --> 01:57:06,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel the same way about Microsoft?

1457
01:57:07,079 --> 01:57:07,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Just making sure.

1458
01:57:07,959 --> 01:57:08,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming you do.

1459
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Reading some of the other answers here.

1460
01:57:11,581 --> 01:57:18,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to Facebook and I'm purposely being a little picky choosy from names I don't see all like in chat and in mailbag and other places.

1461
01:57:18,804 --> 01:57:21,406
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do encourage everybody to go read all of the answers.

1462
01:57:21,466 --> 01:57:23,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

1463
01:57:23,468 --> 01:57:24,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll read this one.

1464
01:57:24,229 --> 01:57:26,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Vince from AKVG Games.

1465
01:57:27,051 --> 01:57:29,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a person that loves making and watching Let's Plays.

1466
01:57:29,773 --> 01:57:31,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody that actually does Let's Play videos.

1467
01:57:32,075 --> 01:57:34,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I neither disagree or agree with Nintendo.

1468
01:57:34,757 --> 01:57:39,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, LPs can be a gain or take on sales depending on how a certain game of theirs is handled.

1469
01:57:39,941 --> 01:57:42,203
[SPEAKER_04]: B. So does reviews and articles.

1470
01:57:43,023 --> 01:57:55,612
[SPEAKER_04]: This was typed via mobile so I'm thinking autocorrect really fucked with that sentence there but I think it's depending on how a certain game of theirs is handled but so do reviews and articles.

1471
01:57:56,252 --> 01:58:00,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tough topic really because we don't really know if Nintendo is right or wrong with making this decision.

1472
01:58:01,375 --> 01:58:06,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess for now if you want to make a living off Nintendo long plays you'll have to contact Nintendo and work something out with them.

1473
01:58:07,299 --> 01:58:11,424
[SPEAKER_04]: At least you're still able to do them and not disappear from the internet like other companies do.

1474
01:58:11,644 --> 01:58:12,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Dot, dot, dot.

1475
01:58:12,765 --> 01:58:13,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega.

1476
01:58:15,708 --> 01:58:17,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Chiggers asks, what's a Let's Play video?

1477
01:58:18,071 --> 01:58:19,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that tongue-in-cheek?

1478
01:58:19,152 --> 01:58:19,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

1479
01:58:20,772 --> 01:58:21,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to Zether.

1480
01:58:21,933 --> 01:58:22,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Zether says,

1481
01:58:45,091 --> 01:58:52,216
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were fun to watch as opposed to most of the YouTube partners who do game long plays for the cash like PewDiePie.

1482
01:58:53,097 --> 01:58:57,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Even people like Chugga Conroy who play Nintendo games are not in it for the money.

1483
01:58:57,741 --> 01:59:01,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is doing the right thing and frankly these people deserve what's coming to them.

1484
01:59:02,524 --> 01:59:04,286
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty pointed answer.

1485
01:59:05,286 --> 01:59:21,708
[SPEAKER_04]: um let's see um Andy R says I don't watch let's plays myself but the news did solely my opinion of Nintendo a bit at least among the couple of people I know who do their own let's plays they're not trying to profit off the content they just want to provide entertainment and to share something they love with others

1486
01:59:22,629 --> 01:59:29,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Benjamin H actually replied to that and said, Andy, those LPs can still provide entertainment and share something they love.

1487
01:59:29,695 --> 01:59:36,862
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're not trying to profit from the Nintendo-based content, are they really going to be majorly affected by Nintendo trying to profit from it?

1488
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:41,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Under Leveled Video replies and says, I do Let's Plays.

1489
01:59:42,302 --> 01:59:46,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I only monetize the videos that the publisher of the game has said it's okay to monetize.

1490
01:59:46,805 --> 01:59:48,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard, Minecraft, etc.

1491
01:59:48,826 --> 01:59:51,668
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't care because they see it as free advertising for them.

1492
01:59:52,068 --> 01:59:59,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Several indie game developers have gone on record to say if it hadn't been for people playing their game on YouTube, they never would have sold as many copies as they did.

1493
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:05,696
[SPEAKER_04]: In an ideal world, I think the ad revenue generated should be split between the game developer and the YouTuber, but

1494
02:00:05,876 --> 02:00:08,999
[SPEAKER_04]: But perfect worlds are impossible in this money-grubbing existence.

1495
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:11,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, because I suggested the same thing earlier.

1496
02:00:11,862 --> 02:00:24,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, I'm just confused that the amount of money that they're generating per each video is so... It's so small that you really think that...

1497
02:00:25,715 --> 02:00:27,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it just seems kind of odd.

1498
02:00:27,276 --> 02:00:37,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand it's your property or whatever, and you're mad at people making money off of it because they like your property and they want to show people stuff.

1499
02:00:37,641 --> 02:00:42,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not like they're putting out a DVD or something with your game on it and saying, oh, this is my game.

1500
02:00:43,403 --> 02:00:45,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I don't know.

1501
02:00:45,264 --> 02:00:50,487
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let me finish the comment here from Underleveled Video because I think the end of it is very interesting.

1502
02:00:51,147 --> 02:00:54,189
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is a gray area, though, in copyright and fair use.

1503
02:00:54,569 --> 02:01:00,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo owns the game, but the YouTuber owns their actions in said game as well as their commentary on top of the video.

1504
02:01:01,213 --> 02:01:04,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a court case needs to happen to make legal precedent.

1505
02:01:04,816 --> 02:01:08,258
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a scary thought, but... Is it really going to come to that?

1506
02:01:08,738 --> 02:01:09,118
[SPEAKER_04]: It might.

1507
02:01:10,619 --> 02:01:28,816
[SPEAKER_05]: uh not in Nintendo's case but maybe another company it could be something like you know where they use that fair was the content ID system and they overreach their bounds and like ban an account that's made a lot of money on something they've done that was Angry Game Nerd or whatever got his channel taken down one time and

1508
02:01:28,976 --> 02:01:34,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, again, I just want to be clear, Nintendo is not doing the strike thing against the people.

1509
02:01:35,317 --> 02:01:46,100
[SPEAKER_04]: They were very clear, and they tried to make themselves look like the good guys in the comments saying, hey, we didn't do what certain other entertainment companies are doing, and we're just switching the monetization thing, basically.

1510
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:50,101
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not actually doing copyright strikes that will get your channel taken down.

1511
02:01:50,541 --> 02:01:56,505
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the eyes of people who are thinking they're being the big asshole, being less of an asshole doesn't make you not an asshole.

1512
02:01:56,605 --> 02:01:57,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

1513
02:01:57,486 --> 02:02:10,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I understand that they're doing the thing or whatever, that they're not taking down videos, but at the same time, they could also be like Minecraft and Blizzard and say, hey, it's cool that you guys show videos of our games.

1514
02:02:11,375 --> 02:02:17,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yes, I understand that they can take down games, but the fact that they're taking all the ad revenue from it is still kind of a dick move.

1515
02:02:18,908 --> 02:02:21,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I want to read one more here.

1516
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:22,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a very interesting response.

1517
02:02:22,771 --> 02:02:30,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of, you know, we've heard a lot of people that are very supportive of what Nintendo's doing and this one is kind of going the other direction that supports the Let's Players a little more.

1518
02:02:30,175 --> 02:02:30,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me read this.

1519
02:02:31,036 --> 02:02:34,899
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Jeff B. A Let's Play video is one's own content.

1520
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:37,881
[SPEAKER_04]: That person's style of play and their commentary make it their own.

1521
02:02:38,221 --> 02:02:40,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not the same as just posting a trailer.

1522
02:02:40,502 --> 02:02:44,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo makes the sandbox, we play in it, or choose not to as we're seeing now.

1523
02:02:44,785 --> 02:03:10,312
[SPEAKER_04]: relatively few YouTube creators make a sole living just off that content most of the time the best they get for doing that work and make no mistake a quality LP is work is a part-time jobs pay or enough for one nice dinner out a month honestly it doesn't even really matter whether Nintendo was legally or morally justified because it was bad business no matter how you slice it and I imagine this problem for Nintendo will diminish quickly as they continue to copyright claim people's LP videos

1524
02:03:10,772 --> 02:03:18,838
[SPEAKER_04]: When Nintendo started this, they had to have known it'd stop Let's Play videos of their own games getting made by a good chunk of the people putting out quality game content on YouTube.

1525
02:03:19,198 --> 02:03:26,164
[SPEAKER_04]: That's free advertising that Nintendo's own, most loyal community does that gets more of their games sold.

1526
02:03:26,504 --> 02:03:33,449
[SPEAKER_04]: If Nintendo wants to nickel and dime, literally nickel and dime in some cases, some of their best community ambassadors, they can go right ahead.

1527
02:03:33,789 --> 02:03:38,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they're legally clear to do that, but maybe they should think twice about turning on their own fans.

1528
02:03:38,573 --> 02:04:04,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I welcome them to come over to Twitch and try the same advertising revenue claim and honestly I'm starting to hope Twitch caves it means no partners will be streaming newer Nintendo games more room for League of Legends streams just kidding I hate League of Legends someday Nintendo will realize that giving people access to your game in nearly any way you can not taking it away brings in sales and by doing this on YouTube they are indirectly taking access away because the community will stop showcasing their games

1529
02:04:06,031 --> 02:04:09,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very much saying that these guys are doing you a favor.

1530
02:04:09,437 --> 02:04:12,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo, you are... I'm kind of summarizing in my own words.

1531
02:04:12,322 --> 02:04:15,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo, you are going to lose a lot of support on this.

1532
02:04:16,181 --> 02:04:21,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I found the tangent on Twitch interesting though.

1533
02:04:21,425 --> 02:04:24,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what the point... I have to be honest.

1534
02:04:24,828 --> 02:04:26,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what the point was you were trying to make with that.

1535
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:31,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Because does that mean you want Nintendo to go over to Twitch and you want Twitch to cave on that?

1536
02:04:32,574 --> 02:04:33,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

1537
02:04:33,074 --> 02:04:36,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then no more newer Nintendo games on Twitch.

1538
02:04:37,037 --> 02:04:37,257
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

1539
02:04:38,498 --> 02:04:41,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you want that to happen if you hate League of Legends?

1540
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:49,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just saying, you know, it'd show them, like, you know, even if they get rid of, you know, YouTube videos of Nintendo games.

1541
02:04:49,926 --> 02:04:51,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And how old are we going here?

1542
02:04:51,287 --> 02:04:57,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we talking about, like, if I have a NES Super Mario Let's Play or something like that, they're going to monetize that?

1543
02:04:57,791 --> 02:05:07,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that right there, they're trying to sell virtual console games, and people don't know what the hell this game is, and they look up a Let's Play video for it, and they're like, hey, that looks kind of cool, I'm going to buy that game.

1544
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:14,382
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have demos for those games, even though they really should find a way to do that.

1545
02:05:14,502 --> 02:05:19,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, we're 2013 and you can't fucking figure out how to make a demo for a game?

1546
02:05:20,104 --> 02:05:24,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't you getting people to your website where the YouTube is posted to make money off your website?

1547
02:05:26,263 --> 02:05:30,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not... There's something I'm not... Because it's automatic.

1548
02:05:30,866 --> 02:05:31,746
[SPEAKER_05]: It's automatic.

1549
02:05:31,826 --> 02:05:34,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Because ad revenue is automatic.

1550
02:05:34,528 --> 02:05:37,470
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just like, you know, why put ads on your website?

1551
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:38,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

1552
02:05:39,611 --> 02:05:55,140
[SPEAKER_05]: What if I have Nintendo content on my website and I'm making ad revenue through those same... Literally, it's the same ads that you're getting through... It's all the Google Analytics stuff, so... It's kind of a workaround, I guess, but...

1553
02:05:56,321 --> 02:06:12,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know I honestly think that the money part of it is a smaller factor than them trying to control content because I mean think about it you've got basically unsolicited advertising coming up yeah but it may not be exactly what Nintendo wants to see out there

1554
02:06:12,847 --> 02:06:14,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that is a workaround.

1555
02:06:14,448 --> 02:06:16,590
[SPEAKER_05]: You make a private video.

1556
02:06:17,131 --> 02:06:19,392
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, hey, someone could even get on this bandwagon.

1557
02:06:19,793 --> 02:06:30,402
[SPEAKER_05]: They have some sort of service where it creates a webpage for you that you go to to watch this video, almost like a URL redirector or shortener or something like that.

1558
02:06:30,842 --> 02:06:36,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, there's ad content on there through Google Analytics, but you're still making money, but you just don't have an advertisement on the video.

1559
02:06:36,707 --> 02:06:37,147
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1560
02:06:38,208 --> 02:06:38,729
[SPEAKER_05]: People love loopholes.

1561
02:06:38,769 --> 02:06:39,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Companies don't.

1562
02:06:50,771 --> 02:07:09,937
[SPEAKER_04]: there's some of the answers again because a lot of these were lengthy and I only have a little bit of time I did not want to read all of them but I encourage you guys to go read them for yourselves facebook.com slash orange lounge radio also google plus there was another answer over there at search for orange launch radio on google plus I would give you all the numbers but you'd forget

1563
02:07:11,308 --> 02:07:11,628
[SPEAKER_04]: E.A.

1564
02:07:12,009 --> 02:07:13,270
[SPEAKER_04]: has no games for the Wii U.

1565
02:07:35,049 --> 02:07:55,807
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think a lot of that has to do with that they're pushing to do the Frostbite 3 engine for a lot of their games including I think sports games and Frostbite 3 does not work on the Wii U or basically they just don't want to make it work on the Wii U because they are developing a new Frostbite engine for mobile so

1566
02:07:56,568 --> 02:08:01,491
[SPEAKER_05]: In theory, they could create a Frostbite 2.5 or something like that that runs on Wii U and just have to port it over.

1567
02:08:01,531 --> 02:08:06,213
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just not worth it to them to do that because they're not making any money off of it.

1568
02:08:06,353 --> 02:08:11,616
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, FIFA 14 is not coming to the Wii U because FIFA 13 sales were not very good.

1569
02:08:11,896 --> 02:08:18,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that's not a really good comparison because FIFA 13 was just FIFA 12 but re-skinned with a roster update.

1570
02:08:18,519 --> 02:08:21,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, that's what it was on the Wii U. So...

1571
02:08:23,928 --> 02:08:50,980
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever but that's the case I think with a lot of these companies they're not porting their games to the Wii U because it's just not making any sense and one of these games that was a big part of E3 their presentation was Ghost Recon Online still on hold even though it was supposed to be coming out when is it coming out we haven't heard anything since like a year ago I don't know let me ask a question here is EA still making games for the Playstation Vita

1572
02:08:52,341 --> 02:08:53,261
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

1573
02:09:12,073 --> 02:09:16,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's necessarily like EA has it out for Nintendo or whatever.

1574
02:09:17,436 --> 02:09:25,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also heard the theory about maybe a botched relationship with Origin on Nintendo or whatever, which actually might be part of it.

1575
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:31,943
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's more in general an inability on Nintendo's part to grasp online.

1576
02:09:32,643 --> 02:09:40,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, for one, the online pass system couldn't be implemented on the Nintendo, which was a problem, I think, for EA in some regards.

1577
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:42,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you don't see it in Mass Effect, do you?

1578
02:09:42,692 --> 02:09:43,592
[SPEAKER_04]: In the Mass Effect game.

1579
02:09:44,013 --> 02:09:48,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you don't see it in Mass Effect, but is it on Assassin's Creed 3?

1580
02:09:48,657 --> 02:09:50,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Because wouldn't that have Uplay on it?

1581
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:54,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Uplay is on Wii U because it's in Zombie U. Well, that's similar.

1582
02:09:55,382 --> 02:10:00,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but there's a whole little separate Uplay channel that you can download and all this stuff on the Wii U as well.

1583
02:10:00,644 --> 02:10:01,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't there be an Origin channel?

1584
02:10:01,684 --> 02:10:02,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1585
02:10:02,465 --> 02:10:14,569
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I think is, I think there's something about the online store and its inability to do what EA wants when it comes to a lot of the DLC, when it comes to the online passes.

1586
02:10:14,629 --> 02:10:15,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, think about it.

1587
02:10:15,650 --> 02:10:18,991
[SPEAKER_04]: None of the Mass Effect 3 DLC ever came to Nintendo.

1588
02:10:19,451 --> 02:10:19,931
[SPEAKER_04]: None of it.

1589
02:10:20,211 --> 02:10:22,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the free stuff or the pay stuff.

1590
02:10:22,532 --> 02:10:28,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Only the stuff that they were able to put on the disc, like the extended cut.

1591
02:10:30,215 --> 02:10:35,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that I think of it too, did any of the DLC come out for Black Ops 2 on the Wii U?

1592
02:10:35,277 --> 02:10:36,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure it did.

1593
02:10:37,634 --> 02:11:04,549
[SPEAKER_04]: so there's something weird there and to me that's the problem and I don't think it's I don't really buy the whole they can't do it I think there's not as much money to be made not because there's a lower adoption of Wii U's or whatever because if they're still making games for the Vita then that's not the only problem but the Vita, it's very easy to incorporate it works just like the Playstation 3 with all the DLC

1594
02:11:05,209 --> 02:11:28,103
[SPEAKER_04]: so I think there's something I think there's something with that is the real reason why EA is not continuing to put games out there because it doesn't match their vision of of being able to nickel and dime you online and possibly whatever is coming after this online pass maybe Wii U can't do hmm think I might be onto something maybe yeah yeah maybe um

1595
02:11:30,197 --> 02:11:30,998
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1596
02:11:48,832 --> 02:11:49,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1597
02:11:49,292 --> 02:11:50,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know what the sales numbers are.

1598
02:11:50,752 --> 02:11:53,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it is something that's worldwide.

1599
02:11:53,373 --> 02:11:58,454
[SPEAKER_05]: FIFA is a really big game worldwide, so maybe that happened.

1600
02:11:58,754 --> 02:12:07,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe they're just going to take the easy way out and just take the game from last year and once again just update the roster and just release a really half-assed game.

1601
02:12:07,476 --> 02:12:07,797
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1602
02:12:07,837 --> 02:12:08,157
[SPEAKER_05]: They might.

1603
02:12:10,757 --> 02:12:14,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they could have done that with the Wii U, but I don't know.

1604
02:12:15,754 --> 02:12:16,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Just release the Wii version?

1605
02:12:17,395 --> 02:12:18,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, the Wii U version.

1606
02:12:18,456 --> 02:12:19,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Just release it again.

1607
02:12:19,737 --> 02:12:21,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Just get it and update the rosters.

1608
02:12:22,839 --> 02:12:23,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

1609
02:12:25,761 --> 02:12:26,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that in your little blog?

1610
02:12:26,982 --> 02:12:27,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1611
02:12:27,323 --> 02:12:27,723
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1612
02:12:28,323 --> 02:12:31,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's move on to some news out of Google this week.

1613
02:12:31,946 --> 02:12:34,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Google had their whole little... What was it called?

1614
02:12:34,168 --> 02:12:35,929
[SPEAKER_04]: The IO conference or something like that?

1615
02:12:36,449 --> 02:12:39,050
[SPEAKER_04]: and they announced some changes coming to Google Maps.

1616
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:44,133
[SPEAKER_04]: They talked about some of the Hangouts and Google+.

1617
02:12:44,193 --> 02:12:51,276
[SPEAKER_04]: They talked a lot about one of the things they talked about on Google+, is that there will no longer be Google Plus games after June 30th.

1618
02:12:51,316 --> 02:12:55,919
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, if you actually go to Google Plus games right now, they say they are no longer going to be available after June 30th.

1619
02:12:56,459 --> 02:12:56,779
[SPEAKER_04]: GameServices.com

1620
02:13:13,261 --> 02:13:21,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of Google Play, a game service that's going to launch out of the Play Store that will link together mobile, social, and cloud gaming.

1621
02:13:21,204 --> 02:13:27,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And I seem to remember they were showing a demo that showed one guy playing on the web, one playing on a phone, and one on a tablet or something.

1622
02:13:28,067 --> 02:13:29,147
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all linked together.

1623
02:13:29,527 --> 02:13:36,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm assuming Google Plus games, I mean, let's be real, they probably were not that popular in the first place because Google Plus did not catch on the way Facebook did.

1624
02:13:37,471 --> 02:13:38,151
[SPEAKER_04]: It's popular.

1625
02:13:38,211 --> 02:13:40,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cultish, but it's not mainstream, right?

1626
02:13:40,812 --> 02:13:40,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1627
02:13:41,332 --> 02:13:44,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So the games aren't catching on, so now you've got this instead.

1628
02:13:45,954 --> 02:13:55,158
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying it's going to be different from Apple and what they do with Game Center because there will be back-end support, and this is not going to be just a standalone application.

1629
02:13:55,738 --> 02:13:59,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone making a game with Google Play has access to the developer services.

1630
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:05,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Some games will have this incorporated already, like World of Goo, Kingdom Rush, Beach Buggy, Blitz...

1631
02:14:06,763 --> 02:14:35,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Osmos and so forth it's not mandatory there's no certification process interesting and it's cross platform which is wonderful they showed on one of the demos it was like a tech demo this racing game where they had all these different tablets and phones and stuff next to each other and it created a racetrack like a slot car racing thing but it was cross platform cross device and it all worked flawlessly

1632
02:14:36,181 --> 02:14:43,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so my thought is that they'll probably incorporate this at some point into Google+, where it's like play the game on the web or something like that.

1633
02:14:43,823 --> 02:14:52,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of an evolution of that, which sounds a lot cooler than Facebook games.

1634
02:14:52,245 --> 02:14:54,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything sounds better than Facebook games.

1635
02:14:54,185 --> 02:14:59,787
[SPEAKER_04]: If I get one more fucking invite for Candy Crush Saga, I'm going to cut somebody.

1636
02:15:00,487 --> 02:15:03,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Being stabbed in the eye is better than... Not really.

1637
02:15:04,511 --> 02:15:06,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Slightly better than Facebook games.

1638
02:15:07,454 --> 02:15:08,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1639
02:15:09,611 --> 02:15:10,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I got some stuff.

1640
02:15:10,852 --> 02:15:12,112
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Nintendo stuff?

1641
02:15:13,113 --> 02:15:17,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, Nintendo won an appeal to keep selling the Wii in the US.

1642
02:15:19,056 --> 02:15:25,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, there was the whole litigation about Motiva, is that how it's pronounced?

1643
02:15:25,979 --> 02:15:31,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Saying that the Wii had infringed on two of its patents to track body position and body movement.

1644
02:15:32,302 --> 02:15:38,866
[SPEAKER_07]: But the judges agreed that their motive was just to win damages or a settlement, not for licensing.

1645
02:15:39,546 --> 02:15:43,968
[SPEAKER_07]: So they said no, and Nintendo won.

1646
02:15:46,389 --> 02:15:54,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So Nintendo can keep selling the Wii, even though they should be trying to get that thing off shelves and try to make people buy Wii U instead, right?

1647
02:15:54,814 --> 02:15:55,114
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1648
02:15:55,734 --> 02:15:58,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they should just give up on the Wii U and actually put out a system.

1649
02:16:01,580 --> 02:16:02,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's too early.

1650
02:16:03,121 --> 02:16:06,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why everybody's like, Wii U's dead and it's only been nine months.

1651
02:16:07,524 --> 02:16:09,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, 3DS, same thing.

1652
02:16:09,585 --> 02:16:15,048
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're sitting here after the holidays still saying the same story, then we can call the Wii U dead.

1653
02:16:15,088 --> 02:16:16,168
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not ready to say that yet.

1654
02:16:17,689 --> 02:16:25,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm not saying it's dead, but it really is highly underperforming for a Nintendo system.

1655
02:16:26,826 --> 02:16:32,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you remember how hyper everyone was about the Wii, and then the Wii U comes out, and I'm still finding them no problem.

1656
02:16:32,771 --> 02:16:33,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, piles of them.

1657
02:16:34,032 --> 02:16:37,094
[SPEAKER_04]: The 3DS was a Nintendo system, and it was the same story.

1658
02:16:37,434 --> 02:16:40,016
[SPEAKER_07]: It sold better than the Wii U. Did it?

1659
02:16:40,456 --> 02:16:41,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it did.

1660
02:16:41,357 --> 02:16:45,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it, yeah, it's selling better than the, well, it's definitely selling better than the Wii U right now.

1661
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:50,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, but the price to get one was also half as much.

1662
02:16:51,862 --> 02:16:52,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1663
02:16:52,662 --> 02:16:53,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Less than a Wii U, for sure.

1664
02:16:55,805 --> 02:16:57,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's $250.

1665
02:16:59,088 --> 02:17:01,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and think about it this way, too.

1666
02:17:01,190 --> 02:17:07,155
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, having a home console is a lot more, I think, of a commitment than having a handheld system.

1667
02:17:08,149 --> 02:17:13,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And with a handheld system, you have the advantage of it being just that, something you can carry around with you.

1668
02:17:13,271 --> 02:17:16,172
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think with the 3DS, too, I mean, look at it this way.

1669
02:17:16,312 --> 02:17:18,733
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a gimmick that was interesting.

1670
02:17:18,913 --> 02:17:22,995
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a 3D display without any 3D glasses.

1671
02:17:23,255 --> 02:17:25,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was like, whoa, that's a neat thing.

1672
02:17:25,936 --> 02:17:29,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Versus the Wii U with, A, it's a tablet controller.

1673
02:17:29,897 --> 02:17:41,869
[SPEAKER_05]: People are used to playing with tablets, so it wasn't that big of a new thing, but 3D graphics without glasses, that was like, holy crap, even if no one uses it anymore.

1674
02:17:42,549 --> 02:17:44,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's phones that do the same thing now.

1675
02:17:44,471 --> 02:17:46,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's old Galaxy did.

1676
02:17:48,604 --> 02:17:48,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1677
02:17:49,124 --> 02:17:50,344
[SPEAKER_07]: The lenticular screen?

1678
02:17:50,684 --> 02:17:54,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not still willing to say it's dead at this point.

1679
02:17:54,785 --> 02:18:03,567
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say I think one big mistake they made is that they made that touchpad was really a step back to where touch gaming is at right now.

1680
02:18:03,887 --> 02:18:05,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the whole having to use a stylus.

1681
02:18:05,308 --> 02:18:11,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess you don't have to for some games, but it really should have been as good of a touch as modern tablets and so forth.

1682
02:18:11,289 --> 02:18:16,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, yeah, people do know a tablet and they expect it to respond a lot better to touch than Nintendo's tablet does.

1683
02:18:17,797 --> 02:18:22,161
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, Dan said that his phone that had the lenticular screen was the thrill.

1684
02:18:23,522 --> 02:18:24,803
[SPEAKER_07]: So it wasn't his Galaxy.

1685
02:18:25,703 --> 02:18:26,724
[SPEAKER_07]: It was still kind of neat, though.

1686
02:18:26,784 --> 02:18:28,566
[SPEAKER_07]: It gave me the same type of headache the 3DS does.

1687
02:18:30,006 --> 02:18:39,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So are we going to have them release a Wii U with Tablet Plus that's going to have multi-touch on it and it's going to be an upgrade of what they do with Wii Remote Plus?

1688
02:18:39,915 --> 02:18:40,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope not.

1689
02:18:41,397 --> 02:18:48,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I still would like to see some more games for the system I have, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's a place we end up next year.

1690
02:18:49,204 --> 02:19:13,262
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think this year is all about this is not a year to release any hardware maybe that whole Wii Fit thing which I'm sure is one of the games they're going to be pushing for the holidays that is a little bit different because that's an add-on with a very specific purpose but this is not the year to be pushing hardware for the Wii U or anything in the living room it will really alienate the people that have supported the system

1691
02:19:15,106 --> 02:19:16,007
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1692
02:19:32,182 --> 02:19:33,062
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, OUYA.

1693
02:19:34,603 --> 02:19:36,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I was joking about this on Bobby's show.

1694
02:19:36,804 --> 02:19:39,104
[SPEAKER_05]: OUYA is going to be at E3.

1695
02:19:39,204 --> 02:19:42,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at E3 in proximity to E3.

1696
02:19:42,385 --> 02:19:45,587
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be in a parking lot outside of E3 in a van.

1697
02:19:46,647 --> 02:19:47,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Down by the river?

1698
02:19:47,747 --> 02:19:49,068
[SPEAKER_05]: By the river, yeah.

1699
02:19:49,168 --> 02:19:56,570
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, they're going to be in the parking lot and they're going to be... They basically said, everything you need to put on a killer game demo.

1700
02:19:56,870 --> 02:19:58,291
[SPEAKER_05]: OUYA console, controllers, and TV.

1701
02:20:01,577 --> 02:20:03,500
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not how you put on a killer game demo.

1702
02:20:03,561 --> 02:20:08,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because... Granted, there are a lot of games... I mean, there's games on the Ouya, but...

1703
02:20:11,296 --> 02:20:15,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all of them were like, hey, buy me because this game is on there.

1704
02:20:16,221 --> 02:20:18,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Although they could show that parking game with no brake.

1705
02:20:18,503 --> 02:20:20,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Parking game is awesome.

1706
02:20:20,185 --> 02:20:21,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I want to know.

1707
02:20:21,486 --> 02:20:23,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know how they're going to fix my controller.

1708
02:20:23,188 --> 02:20:25,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my controller is all fucked up.

1709
02:20:26,130 --> 02:20:31,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently the newer consoles that are shipping now have a fixed controller.

1710
02:20:31,475 --> 02:20:33,758
[SPEAKER_05]: So where do I RMA that bitch?

1711
02:20:33,818 --> 02:20:34,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Because...

1712
02:20:35,379 --> 02:20:35,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1713
02:20:47,079 --> 02:20:47,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1714
02:21:07,664 --> 02:21:19,815
[SPEAKER_04]: This is likely the same lot that Saints Row the Third used last year, which is across the street from Staples Center, which got even more exposure because, hey, it was right during the time when the Lakers were in the playoffs last year when E3 was going on.

1715
02:21:20,215 --> 02:21:21,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Or was it last year or two years ago?

1716
02:21:21,417 --> 02:21:21,997
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was last year.

1717
02:21:22,398 --> 02:21:24,780
[SPEAKER_04]: So even extra exposure, right?

1718
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:25,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1719
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:25,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1720
02:21:27,941 --> 02:21:39,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, well, Konami talking E3 or at least a pre-E3 show and they've been doing this kind of, they've been doing like the Nintendo Direct thing for a little while too.

1721
02:21:39,966 --> 02:21:41,486
[SPEAKER_04]: They do these videos that go out.

1722
02:21:42,327 --> 02:21:49,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So Konami will be doing a pre-E3 show that will give the latest on some of their franchises on June 6th.

1723
02:21:49,749 --> 02:21:51,510
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the third year that they've done it.

1724
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:55,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Notice how, I think the last time they did it was when Rock Revolution came out.

1725
02:21:56,912 --> 02:21:58,494
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1726
02:22:14,869 --> 02:22:19,733
[SPEAKER_04]: New trailers for Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2, which was also seen last year.

1727
02:22:21,154 --> 02:22:22,375
[SPEAKER_04]: A year before last, I think.

1728
02:22:22,415 --> 02:22:26,978
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, Metal Gear Solid 5, which I'm sure some people are very excited about.

1729
02:22:27,018 --> 02:22:28,099
[SPEAKER_04]: The Phantom Pain.

1730
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:29,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Snake is even older.

1731
02:22:29,901 --> 02:22:31,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that will be there as well.

1732
02:22:32,122 --> 02:22:35,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure there will be some other unannounced goodies, too.

1733
02:22:35,825 --> 02:22:38,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we have some longtime Bomani fans who still listen to the show.

1734
02:22:39,448 --> 02:22:43,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I would not go in anticipating anything as far as the beat games go, but...

1735
02:22:44,031 --> 02:22:47,732
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know if the new Xbox has this Kinect thing built in.

1736
02:22:48,392 --> 02:22:53,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll try the Rhythm Party thing again or Dance Masters.

1737
02:22:55,294 --> 02:22:56,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Dance Masters did very well.

1738
02:22:57,034 --> 02:22:59,455
[SPEAKER_04]: But Rhythm Party was just on sale over the weekend.

1739
02:22:59,475 --> 02:23:00,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It might still be, actually.

1740
02:23:00,495 --> 02:23:04,476
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have Rhythm Party and you like Bomani games and you have a Kinect, Rhythm Party's...

1741
02:23:05,336 --> 02:23:05,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

1742
02:23:06,296 --> 02:23:08,617
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is there's only like five songs in the base game.

1743
02:23:08,657 --> 02:23:09,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all DLC.

1744
02:23:09,937 --> 02:23:11,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a pretty well put together game.

1745
02:23:12,018 --> 02:23:15,219
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have just made it a disc game with a well-rounded 50 songs.

1746
02:23:15,239 --> 02:23:15,939
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been awesome.

1747
02:23:16,599 --> 02:23:18,199
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so I don't know.

1748
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:21,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't hold my breath as far as music games go, though.

1749
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:23,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you're going to see Beat Mania 2DX or anything.

1750
02:23:23,521 --> 02:23:23,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1751
02:23:24,041 --> 02:23:25,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Just call it a hunch.

1752
02:23:25,101 --> 02:23:27,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of that stuff is long gone.

1753
02:23:28,202 --> 02:23:30,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the heck they would be putting up then because...

1754
02:23:31,323 --> 02:23:31,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Pro Evo

1755
02:23:47,267 --> 02:23:50,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go on to the mailbag.

1756
02:23:50,628 --> 02:24:01,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives into the email bag head first and tries not to catch anything as she's pulling out your emails to read here on the show.

1757
02:24:02,953 --> 02:24:06,334
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, why don't you read some emails for us?

1758
02:24:06,955 --> 02:24:08,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we have three.

1759
02:24:09,696 --> 02:24:10,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Three whole emails.

1760
02:24:11,585 --> 02:24:36,672
[SPEAKER_07]: um, the first one dear OLR, a very belated congratulations on your achievement of reaching 500 plus episodes excuse me thanks for being there with me on so many long drives to work and back I wish that I could join you on live shows more often but family commitments usually conflict with that I have been listening to you since before my son was even born six years ago who is now old enough to game with me thank you for making me feel old

1761
02:24:37,655 --> 02:24:38,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1762
02:24:38,835 --> 02:24:39,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

1763
02:24:39,976 --> 02:24:51,258
[SPEAKER_07]: With the new Next Box being announced this week, I continue to be very excited about gaming even though I miss the days of the arcade or days gone by of trying to finish games we rented from the local video store.

1764
02:24:51,858 --> 02:24:58,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I feel that gamers today are very jaded considering there is a gamut of options out there on every imaginable platform.

1765
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:01,981
[SPEAKER_07]: The constant complaints can often be disheartening.

1766
02:25:02,561 --> 02:25:03,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with that.

1767
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:04,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um...

1768
02:25:26,186 --> 02:25:28,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll go ahead and read it because it's kind of long.

1769
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:31,652
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up to you if you want to read the rest of this on air or not.

1770
02:25:31,672 --> 02:25:37,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping DarkSakura, since she is unemployed or someone OLR, can use this license either for the show or even just to enjoy.

1771
02:25:37,439 --> 02:25:39,761
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome to keep it or give it away as you please.

1772
02:25:39,921 --> 02:25:40,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

1773
02:25:42,584 --> 02:25:44,687
[SPEAKER_07]: A one year subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud.

1774
02:25:46,141 --> 02:25:52,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I saw that in the email bag earlier this week, and I was like, oh boy, DarkSakura's going to be pretty excited about that.

1775
02:25:53,006 --> 02:25:55,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I need new underwear, please.

1776
02:25:55,187 --> 02:25:58,149
[SPEAKER_04]: If she doesn't want it, then I would like to get the new audition.

1777
02:25:58,209 --> 02:26:02,332
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great for podcasts.

1778
02:26:03,533 --> 02:26:08,496
[SPEAKER_04]: But a very, very generous donation, and...

1779
02:26:09,677 --> 02:26:23,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always amazed by the generosity of our listeners just in being here and participating and even when there's free stuff like this to come out of it and a lot of that stuff will go right back into helping the show and VOG.

1780
02:26:23,965 --> 02:26:30,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, given that I'm doing all of the graphics for the site and everything, yeah, I think I have a use for this.

1781
02:26:31,405 --> 02:26:33,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, very cool.

1782
02:26:33,390 --> 02:26:35,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, I'm actually tearing up a little bit now.

1783
02:26:35,675 --> 02:26:36,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you really?

1784
02:26:36,677 --> 02:26:37,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit.

1785
02:26:37,178 --> 02:26:37,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you cry on air?

1786
02:26:38,541 --> 02:26:39,403
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I won't cry on air.

1787
02:26:39,503 --> 02:26:41,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I cried on air when we got a gift once.

1788
02:26:41,207 --> 02:26:42,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't you cry on air?

1789
02:26:43,174 --> 02:26:43,814
[SPEAKER_07]: You've cried on air.

1790
02:26:44,255 --> 02:26:47,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I have cried on air, probably more than once, but anyhow.

1791
02:26:47,496 --> 02:26:53,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually just cry from wank, but this is actually like, oh my god, it's super, super awesome.

1792
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:55,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So, again, thank you.

1793
02:26:55,861 --> 02:26:56,861
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

1794
02:26:56,901 --> 02:26:57,722
[SPEAKER_04]: You really didn't have to.

1795
02:26:57,842 --> 02:26:59,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that shit ain't cheap.

1796
02:27:00,263 --> 02:27:07,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you might have had it in or whatever, but I really hope you did not have to pay a lot of money for that.

1797
02:27:07,087 --> 02:27:07,307
[SPEAKER_04]: That's...

1798
02:27:08,948 --> 02:27:12,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't the current CS suite something like a good $700?

1799
02:27:14,434 --> 02:27:18,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I know that when I tried to get the student edition for CS6, it was like $300.

1800
02:27:18,838 --> 02:27:21,541
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm still using 5.1.

1801
02:27:23,323 --> 02:27:26,546
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm feeling verklempt.

1802
02:27:27,701 --> 02:27:30,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk amongst yourselves, we'll give you a topic.

1803
02:27:31,223 --> 02:27:33,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, I'm ready to go on.

1804
02:27:34,344 --> 02:27:38,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just a little floored right now, and probably sinus medicine has something to do with that too.

1805
02:27:40,587 --> 02:27:49,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear OLR, after a two week vacation, I came back to find my Wii U gamepad was left on in TV remote controller mode the entire time plus a day.

1806
02:27:50,172 --> 02:27:52,114
[SPEAKER_07]: or 360 hours straight.

1807
02:27:52,614 --> 02:27:56,998
[SPEAKER_07]: It responded when I turned it off and I later started the Wii U to see if I had burn-in on the pad.

1808
02:27:57,218 --> 02:27:57,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope!

1809
02:27:58,819 --> 02:28:01,181
[SPEAKER_07]: It was plugged in the whole time or it would have turned itself off.

1810
02:28:01,301 --> 02:28:04,304
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good argument for unplugging it while playing and that's from Rababa.

1811
02:28:05,645 --> 02:28:06,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1812
02:28:06,386 --> 02:28:08,207
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a long time to leave that thing on.

1813
02:28:08,247 --> 02:28:10,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that thing was only supposed to work for like three hours.

1814
02:28:10,929 --> 02:28:15,493
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess maybe because the remote doesn't really use the transmitter functions.

1815
02:28:15,833 --> 02:28:16,734
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

1816
02:28:16,754 --> 02:28:17,735
[SPEAKER_07]: He said it was plugged in.

1817
02:28:19,106 --> 02:28:19,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's plugged in.

1818
02:28:20,146 --> 02:28:20,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1819
02:28:21,687 --> 02:28:22,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1820
02:28:22,847 --> 02:28:27,669
[SPEAKER_07]: But on top of that, though, it not having any burn-in is... I'm sorry, I'm still a little floored by the other thing.

1821
02:28:28,089 --> 02:28:31,270
[SPEAKER_07]: It not having burn-in is actually pretty amazing.

1822
02:28:32,131 --> 02:28:36,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember... Now, of course, this was 19 years ago, earlier than that.

1823
02:28:37,692 --> 02:28:41,714
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, having Samurai Shodown 3 and the big screen having burn-in after a week.

1824
02:28:42,954 --> 02:28:47,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean... I remember the Apple IIe monitors were really susceptible to burn-in.

1825
02:28:47,596 --> 02:28:48,216
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to be careful.

1826
02:28:48,832 --> 02:28:53,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, you had that little icon in the corner like forever that was your computer icon.

1827
02:28:53,234 --> 02:28:53,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1828
02:28:53,635 --> 02:28:54,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it lived there.

1829
02:28:54,735 --> 02:28:55,516
[SPEAKER_07]: It never went away.

1830
02:28:57,116 --> 02:28:59,498
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's pretty impressive.

1831
02:28:59,518 --> 02:29:02,559
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually a really good sign of a quality product.

1832
02:29:02,679 --> 02:29:04,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I won't rag on the Wii U that much anymore.

1833
02:29:05,221 --> 02:29:05,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I will.

1834
02:29:05,881 --> 02:29:06,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you will.

1835
02:29:06,561 --> 02:29:06,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't lie.

1836
02:29:07,582 --> 02:29:08,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know me.

1837
02:29:08,902 --> 02:29:09,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a hater.

1838
02:29:10,043 --> 02:29:12,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Liars don't get codes for software.

1839
02:29:15,549 --> 02:29:16,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we have one more email.

1840
02:29:18,295 --> 02:29:22,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And this person does not give us a name, so I'm just gonna say Kirk.

1841
02:29:27,344 --> 02:29:28,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, my OLR peeps.

1842
02:29:28,985 --> 02:29:36,769
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Kirk, and I wanted to email you guys and say that for about six to eight months, I was taking a break from console gaming and listening to gaming podcasts.

1843
02:29:37,169 --> 02:29:45,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Your show was one of my gaming podcasts I would listen to on a regular basis, and even though I couldn't make it to the live streams, I've been a loyal listener for many years.

1844
02:29:45,353 --> 02:29:45,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, we love you.

1845
02:29:46,494 --> 02:29:55,823
[SPEAKER_07]: But this past year, I decided to be a real adult, which leads me to buying my first home, going back to school to finish my degree, and finally working on those New Year resolutions of losing weight.

1846
02:29:56,144 --> 02:29:58,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently have lost 121 pounds.

1847
02:29:58,066 --> 02:29:59,207
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like losing a supermodel.

1848
02:29:59,627 --> 02:30:00,388
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

1849
02:30:01,529 --> 02:30:10,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say, though, with all due respect, I think that's great that you have those priorities, but I don't own a home, I don't have a degree from college, and I'm fat.

1850
02:30:11,319 --> 02:30:12,460
[SPEAKER_07]: You are not that, Rob.

1851
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:14,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I still feel like an adult.

1852
02:30:14,762 --> 02:30:17,925
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just saying, you don't have to have those things.

1853
02:30:17,965 --> 02:30:20,347
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand the point the listener was trying to make.

1854
02:30:21,368 --> 02:30:22,229
[SPEAKER_07]: You are not that, Rob.

1855
02:30:26,459 --> 02:30:46,223
[SPEAKER_07]: with being occupied with all those things along with a full time job gaming fell by the wayside and I've given up my PS3, Xbox 360, 3DS and listening to gaming podcasts things have settled down recently this year with me adjusting to my new townhouse except for the noisy neighbors and keeping a regular routine with school and gym time I've gotten back into gaming

1856
02:30:47,063 --> 02:30:47,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw.

1857
02:30:47,143 --> 02:30:47,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw.

1858
02:31:07,689 --> 02:31:12,913
[SPEAKER_07]: On My Favorite Hobbies was listening to you while listening to podcasts in the background.

1859
02:31:13,354 --> 02:31:16,796
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to say thank you for entertaining me for so many years.

1860
02:31:16,876 --> 02:31:18,598
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm glad to be back as a loyal listener.

1861
02:31:18,998 --> 02:31:20,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we are glad to have you back.

1862
02:31:21,099 --> 02:31:24,062
[SPEAKER_04]: This fat homeless dropout is so happy to have you here.

1863
02:31:25,903 --> 02:31:26,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to, sorry.

1864
02:31:27,605 --> 02:31:28,566
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1865
02:31:29,407 --> 02:31:30,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the real point.

1866
02:31:31,148 --> 02:31:38,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes in order to make change happen in your life, you have to change some things.

1867
02:31:38,415 --> 02:31:40,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get the point.

1868
02:31:41,057 --> 02:31:47,843
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have one thing that is becoming so distracting to the point that you can't get anything else done...

1869
02:31:48,544 --> 02:31:49,766
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1870
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:11,681
[SPEAKER_07]: People who drink, you know?

1871
02:32:12,421 --> 02:32:17,523
[SPEAKER_07]: You either can cut it out a little bit and you're fine or you have to cold turkey it and not drink at all.

1872
02:32:18,763 --> 02:32:19,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Or smoking.

1873
02:32:19,303 --> 02:32:25,125
[SPEAKER_07]: To be able to get to your other priorities and stop something that's getting in the way of a productive life.

1874
02:32:25,485 --> 02:32:30,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Or smoking, Jamie, because some people can do it cold turkey or some people have to do it cold turkey.

1875
02:32:30,647 --> 02:32:34,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people need the patch or a support group or, you know.

1876
02:32:35,549 --> 02:32:37,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you're my uncle and you smoke the electric cigarettes.

1877
02:32:38,130 --> 02:32:38,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1878
02:32:40,029 --> 02:32:41,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I will go ahead and say this.

1879
02:32:41,811 --> 02:32:45,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicotine in and of itself is as bad for you as caffeine.

1880
02:32:45,696 --> 02:32:46,678
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all the other crap in it.

1881
02:32:47,979 --> 02:32:54,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, I personally take exception to the real adult thing, but I understand it.

1882
02:32:56,250 --> 02:32:56,530
[SPEAKER_07]: You know.

1883
02:32:57,378 --> 02:32:58,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1884
02:33:23,234 --> 02:33:23,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, same here.

1885
02:33:24,074 --> 02:33:25,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'd like to have a job.

1886
02:33:26,475 --> 02:33:27,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Not for lack of trying.

1887
02:33:27,916 --> 02:33:28,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1888
02:33:28,256 --> 02:33:39,480
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, you know, I think that you could, and I've had to explain this to my mother, and I always give her a hard time because I was like, how much of my Nintendo did you play when I was 12?

1889
02:33:41,659 --> 02:33:44,000
[SPEAKER_07]: You can be into gaming.

1890
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:53,123
[SPEAKER_07]: You can be into people years older than me who are still majorly into every new anime that ever comes out.

1891
02:33:53,683 --> 02:33:59,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not as much as I used to be even though something comes out that I might like or I like watching the old stuff.

1892
02:34:00,105 --> 02:34:01,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's got their thing.

1893
02:34:01,686 --> 02:34:07,548
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing wrong with enjoying something and having fun as long as you don't do it to the exception of all else.

1894
02:34:07,828 --> 02:34:08,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1895
02:34:10,150 --> 02:34:35,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's the real point, yes Exactly, and yeah, I'm not going to go off anymore about that But I do have to say congratulations to you, Kirk, for your fantastic achievements I mean, you lost a person That's amazing Dan lost that much Yeah, Extifer from Horde House lost a whole heck of a lot as well And I know that took a lot of work, and it's very impressive

1896
02:34:36,508 --> 02:34:40,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, thank you, Fifth Dream, for not making me feel like I'm the oldest person in chat.

1897
02:34:42,312 --> 02:34:42,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearts.

1898
02:34:43,092 --> 02:34:43,633
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it, Rob.

1899
02:34:44,073 --> 02:34:44,893
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for the emails.

1900
02:34:44,933 --> 02:34:53,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Before we get back into some gaming news, it's time for us to get a little ranty with a segment we call the F-Years of the Week.

1901
02:35:10,578 --> 02:35:17,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the only F you that I have is to this cold that I got from Dan.

1902
02:35:19,344 --> 02:35:26,289
[SPEAKER_07]: But other than that, I'm looking at the Adobe site with tears in my eyes.

1903
02:35:26,449 --> 02:35:27,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so happy.

1904
02:35:29,031 --> 02:35:31,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm seriously like shaking with joy.

1905
02:35:34,315 --> 02:35:38,658
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Panto knocked on my door and said we want you to design everything in the world for us.

1906
02:35:39,417 --> 02:35:41,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that ruins the angsty segment.

1907
02:35:43,239 --> 02:35:47,301
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to that emailer for the generous gift for screwing up the FUs.

1908
02:35:47,341 --> 02:35:48,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1909
02:35:48,942 --> 02:35:49,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1910
02:35:50,483 --> 02:36:00,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and F you to everyone putting spoilers out about Star Trek Into Darkness because I haven't seen it yet and I'm not reading any reviews because they've all been spoilery.

1911
02:36:03,009 --> 02:36:03,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1912
02:36:03,790 --> 02:36:04,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1913
02:36:06,406 --> 02:36:11,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, to UEF for their controllers being all sorts of broken.

1914
02:36:11,670 --> 02:36:12,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the analogs.

1915
02:36:12,730 --> 02:36:13,471
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really annoying.

1916
02:36:13,851 --> 02:36:18,355
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be fixed with a software patch, but it's not really fixed.

1917
02:36:18,415 --> 02:36:20,976
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of a workaround, I guess.

1918
02:36:21,917 --> 02:36:25,139
[SPEAKER_05]: It still sucks, though, because I'm trying to play some of these games and it's just like, ugh.

1919
02:36:27,501 --> 02:36:29,022
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1920
02:36:29,403 --> 02:36:33,146
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to... I don't know.

1921
02:36:33,306 --> 02:36:36,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are fairly well, so I don't have a lot of angst.

1922
02:36:37,049 --> 02:36:41,713
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to traffic on the way to the Bay Area, because it took me three hours to make a drive that should take an hour and 45 minutes.

1923
02:36:44,275 --> 02:37:07,066
[SPEAKER_04]: and FU to the Kabuki Theater in San Francisco although actually it's kind of like the good kind of FU because like I loved seeing that movie there so much because it was in a theater that served booze and they only let 21 and up people in there so no babies and the reason why I say FU is now I want to see every movie at that theater in San Francisco and that's not possible

1924
02:37:09,784 --> 02:37:13,965
[SPEAKER_04]: My movie-going experience bar has been forever changed because of that.

1925
02:37:14,585 --> 02:37:15,706
[SPEAKER_04]: The bar has been raised.

1926
02:37:15,726 --> 02:37:16,286
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1927
02:37:16,486 --> 02:37:17,306
[SPEAKER_04]: The bar has been raised.

1928
02:37:17,786 --> 02:37:18,086
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1929
02:37:18,626 --> 02:37:24,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we will get to Twitter topics and our Skype line here eventually.

1930
02:37:25,368 --> 02:37:26,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get to Loki.

1931
02:37:27,489 --> 02:37:36,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was an announcement a few months ago about Batman Arkham Origins, and it was revealed that

1932
02:37:37,051 --> 02:37:41,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Batman's not going to be voiced by Kevin Conroy anymore.

1933
02:37:41,354 --> 02:37:42,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a new person.

1934
02:37:43,335 --> 02:37:44,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was much bitching.

1935
02:37:44,996 --> 02:37:54,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thankfully now, the deal has been put in place where, yes, Kevin Conroy will be Batman because he is Batman.

1936
02:37:54,463 --> 02:38:00,707
[SPEAKER_05]: And he will be returning as the voice of Batman in the new game when it comes out in October.

1937
02:38:01,447 --> 02:38:10,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Also revealed, thanks to an Amazon pre-order, there apparently will be DLC where Deathstroke will be playable in some form.

1938
02:38:10,910 --> 02:38:13,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably like the Challenge missions and the other games.

1939
02:38:14,151 --> 02:38:16,032
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, neat.

1940
02:38:18,032 --> 02:38:18,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Glad that they have it.

1941
02:38:18,613 --> 02:38:19,573
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll make a lot of people happy.

1942
02:38:19,932 --> 02:38:21,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm glad that they have the original voice coming back.

1943
02:38:21,892 --> 02:38:29,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, is Mark Hamill actually going to be doing the voice of the Joker again in this game, or is it going to be just like... I don't think the Joker's in it.

1944
02:38:29,534 --> 02:38:30,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's how they got around it.

1945
02:38:30,634 --> 02:38:33,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but Mark Hamill has officially retired.

1946
02:38:35,995 --> 02:38:36,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure he has.

1947
02:38:37,716 --> 02:38:39,036
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he actually really has retired.

1948
02:38:39,336 --> 02:38:40,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently it was doing a number on his voice.

1949
02:38:44,497 --> 02:38:47,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so, yeah, Deathstroke would be kind of cool.

1950
02:38:49,892 --> 02:38:52,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know we'll see

1951
02:39:16,144 --> 02:39:18,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one more story for you guys, and I apologize.

1952
02:39:18,506 --> 02:39:21,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It's political, but it is making the rounds on the gaming blogs this week.

1953
02:39:22,589 --> 02:39:25,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a comment from Vice President Joe Biden.

1954
02:39:26,211 --> 02:39:31,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you might remember that when the whole horrible, horrible thing in the school in Connecticut broke out.

1955
02:39:32,155 --> 02:39:34,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe Biden started a task force.

1956
02:39:34,776 --> 02:39:39,218
[SPEAKER_04]: He was assigned by President Obama to talk about how do you curtail gun violence and so forth.

1957
02:39:39,738 --> 02:39:42,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did this whole thing about games and all this.

1958
02:39:43,180 --> 02:39:50,783
[SPEAKER_04]: In May, the vice president met with 20 representatives from face-based organizations to talk about gun control and immigration.

1959
02:39:51,123 --> 02:39:54,664
[SPEAKER_04]: He talked about video games in this as well, according to Politico.

1960
02:39:55,565 --> 02:40:01,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Franklin Graham, who is the son of Billy Graham, the evangelist, I guess is what you call him,

1961
02:40:02,367 --> 02:40:13,611
[SPEAKER_04]: said to the vice president that, quote, media and entertainment that portray violence should be subject to a special tax with the proceeds going to help victims and their family.

1962
02:40:14,431 --> 02:40:18,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is according to a rabbi, Rabbi Julie Schoenfeld, who was also in that session.

1963
02:40:19,873 --> 02:40:24,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Biden said, quote, there's no, quote, no restriction on the ability to do that.

1964
02:40:24,894 --> 02:40:27,135
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no legal reason why they couldn't

1965
02:40:28,815 --> 02:40:30,916
[SPEAKER_04]: do attacks on violent media.

1966
02:40:32,277 --> 02:40:39,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Going on, the quote says, he said they really need a good scientific study, which they've done on things like smoking.

1967
02:40:39,479 --> 02:40:51,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's interesting about this is that it's not necessarily limited to games, which I can appreciate for one, is that when they talk about attacks on violent games, then I'm like, well, what about R-rated movies and NC-17 movies?

1968
02:40:51,703 --> 02:40:54,704
[SPEAKER_04]: And what about things on TV and networks and

1969
02:40:54,924 --> 02:40:55,945
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1970
02:41:17,041 --> 02:41:19,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I think that's just ridiculous.

1971
02:41:19,565 --> 02:41:22,549
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way I could see them ever doing that is because we need the tax dollars.

1972
02:41:22,769 --> 02:41:32,442
[SPEAKER_05]: But, other than that, I mean, it's just... It's kind of ridiculous, because once again, you're just taxing things that don't necessarily have a direct correlation with violence.

1973
02:41:33,623 --> 02:41:41,209
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, the problem with this, it all goes back to the root problem with that California law that we spent all this money trying to defend.

1974
02:41:41,229 --> 02:41:45,532
[SPEAKER_04]: The Supreme Court overturned it because it was all up to somebody's interpretation.

1975
02:41:46,253 --> 02:41:49,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And how can you tax something that has to be interpreted?

1976
02:41:51,136 --> 02:41:58,242
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair to the Vice President, even though I don't necessarily agree with what he said, he did say we would need a really good scientific study.

1977
02:41:58,662 --> 02:41:59,803
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have to have facts.

1978
02:41:59,843 --> 02:42:01,184
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to need to waste more money.

1979
02:42:02,705 --> 02:42:03,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1980
02:42:04,988 --> 02:42:08,712
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just don't think it would be successful because what is violent?

1981
02:42:09,292 --> 02:42:20,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody would have to set that line and it's too what's violent to me might be not necessarily what's violent to you what's not violent to Franklin Graham or Rabbi Julie Schoenfeld

1982
02:42:21,058 --> 02:42:39,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they're ignoring is that there actually have been scientific studies that have disproven that violent video games aren't just as likely as a movie or watching the news or reading a book.

1983
02:42:39,716 --> 02:42:40,997
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing.

1984
02:42:41,718 --> 02:42:46,222
[SPEAKER_07]: They're as likely to cause violence as any other portrayal.

1985
02:42:47,756 --> 02:42:48,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1986
02:43:07,494 --> 02:43:12,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, the whole rating system in and of itself is a really horrible joke.

1987
02:43:12,401 --> 02:43:13,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about the game ratings.

1988
02:43:13,763 --> 02:43:16,587
[SPEAKER_04]: The game ratings are actually better right now than the movie ratings.

1989
02:43:16,667 --> 02:43:17,268
[SPEAKER_04]: They really are.

1990
02:43:17,809 --> 02:43:20,533
[SPEAKER_04]: The movie ratings is in need of a serious, serious...

1991
02:43:21,534 --> 02:43:22,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Reorganization.

1992
02:43:22,474 --> 02:43:38,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everything from the fact that you have R-rated movies that are like Saw-level violent, then you have an R-rated movie like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion is an R-rated movie because the F-word is used more than once by Janine Garofalo's character.

1993
02:43:38,681 --> 02:43:45,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put a movie like Romy and Michelle next to a movie like Saw and I'm like, you know, we got a problem.

1994
02:43:45,884 --> 02:43:50,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Janine Garofalo is just an R-rated actress, so it makes sense.

1995
02:43:50,846 --> 02:43:52,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, didn't she also turn Scientologist?

1996
02:43:53,388 --> 02:43:55,430
[SPEAKER_07]: It just makes me roll my eyes and feel very sad.

1997
02:43:55,450 --> 02:43:56,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, you know what, that's her thing.

1998
02:43:56,891 --> 02:43:57,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

1999
02:43:58,713 --> 02:44:02,036
[SPEAKER_04]: That's totally not the point I'm trying to make here is about the movie.

2000
02:44:03,497 --> 02:44:07,280
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a joke that a movie like that, I mean, should kids see it?

2001
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:12,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily, but I think a 14 or a 15 year old could see it.

2002
02:44:12,945 --> 02:44:14,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no worse than there are.

2003
02:44:14,106 --> 02:44:16,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a movie about high school for fuck's sake.

2004
02:44:16,909 --> 02:44:19,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's nothing different than what they're hearing at school.

2005
02:44:20,053 --> 02:44:21,114
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's silly.

2006
02:44:23,590 --> 02:44:24,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2007
02:44:24,030 --> 02:44:32,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Degenerate Johnny in chat at live.vognetwork.com says FCC has been quoted to state that the ESRB is the best rating system of all entertainment.

2008
02:44:33,093 --> 02:44:39,375
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says Evil Dead, the new one, was originally rated NC-17 until they cut a few scenes out.

2009
02:44:39,435 --> 02:44:39,855
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2010
02:44:40,015 --> 02:44:41,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I have zero interest in the new Evil Dead.

2011
02:44:42,516 --> 02:44:43,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero.

2012
02:44:43,337 --> 02:44:45,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard things about the movie and I'm just like, no thanks.

2013
02:44:46,057 --> 02:44:47,678
[SPEAKER_07]: It does not have the chin.

2014
02:44:48,518 --> 02:44:49,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

2015
02:44:50,740 --> 02:44:51,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

2016
02:44:51,481 --> 02:44:52,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get you legit caught up.

2017
02:44:53,042 --> 02:44:54,643
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I really don't care.

2018
02:44:55,304 --> 02:44:59,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, but... I kind of want to see it, but it doesn't have Bruce, so what's the point?

2019
02:44:59,787 --> 02:45:00,487
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in the cameo.

2020
02:45:00,988 --> 02:45:01,568
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I know that.

2021
02:45:01,628 --> 02:45:02,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

2022
02:45:02,649 --> 02:45:05,131
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a Bruce Campbell being in the movie movie.

2023
02:45:05,251 --> 02:45:06,532
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of cameo does he have?

2024
02:45:07,553 --> 02:45:08,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

2025
02:45:08,873 --> 02:45:10,334
[SPEAKER_07]: What, does he open the door for somebody?

2026
02:45:10,374 --> 02:45:10,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2027
02:45:10,895 --> 02:45:12,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he a manager at S-Mart?

2028
02:45:12,716 --> 02:45:14,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know and I wouldn't want to spoil it.

2029
02:45:14,777 --> 02:45:19,060
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a producer on the movie, so that's why.

2030
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:19,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I don't care.

2031
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:20,100
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2032
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:23,082
[SPEAKER_05]: If the proceeds from this movie go to making an Army of Darkness 2...

2033
02:45:24,503 --> 02:45:25,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

2034
02:45:25,144 --> 02:45:26,225
[SPEAKER_04]: It exists for a purpose.

2035
02:45:26,345 --> 02:45:37,880
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, judge however you want to judge, but I will be there as I am every single year for the showing of Showgirls at the Castro Theater hosted by Drag Queens because I live for that shit.

2036
02:45:37,940 --> 02:45:41,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I need to go again this year because I didn't go last year and I'm sad.

2037
02:45:41,824 --> 02:45:43,226
[SPEAKER_04]: So, judge me all you want.

2038
02:45:43,286 --> 02:45:45,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't go see Evil Dead, but I'll go see Showgirls for the 10th time in the theater.

2039
02:45:45,870 --> 02:45:47,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's Elizabeth Berkley doing right now?

2040
02:45:47,432 --> 02:45:52,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously think that we should... They should kickstart a sequel to that movie.

2041
02:45:52,258 --> 02:45:53,720
[SPEAKER_04]: They, okay.

2042
02:45:54,061 --> 02:45:57,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Why we're talking about this on OLR, I don't know, but we're almost at the end of the show, so we can do this.

2043
02:45:58,226 --> 02:46:00,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Showgirls 2, Pennies from Heaven

2044
02:46:26,647 --> 02:46:27,688
[SPEAKER_04]: was the sequel.

2045
02:46:27,728 --> 02:46:32,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on IMDb, and they actually were selling DVDs, and they screened the movie earlier in the day.

2046
02:46:32,611 --> 02:46:33,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to see that.

2047
02:46:33,592 --> 02:46:34,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I haven't seen it.

2048
02:46:34,772 --> 02:46:36,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not going to bother watching it.

2049
02:46:36,474 --> 02:46:40,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought she was a great sport for going and participating.

2050
02:46:40,696 --> 02:46:51,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, there's a Showgirls Off-Off Broadway production right now, and she actually is in it right now as the character she played in the movie.

2051
02:46:51,544 --> 02:46:52,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great.

2052
02:46:54,804 --> 02:46:58,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I just realized I won't talk about Evil Dead, but I know the In and Outs of Showgirls.

2053
02:46:59,566 --> 02:47:00,546
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so bad, it's good.

2054
02:47:00,566 --> 02:47:01,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially the same thing.

2055
02:47:01,807 --> 02:47:02,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't help myself.

2056
02:47:04,628 --> 02:47:05,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, Rob.

2057
02:47:07,369 --> 02:47:11,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like violence and body parts and animal violence.

2058
02:47:11,571 --> 02:47:12,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I love titties.

2059
02:47:14,892 --> 02:47:17,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's such a terrible thing.

2060
02:47:17,453 --> 02:47:22,195
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, the sex scene in the pool kind of looked like she was being attacked by a shark.

2061
02:47:22,515 --> 02:47:27,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, that's sort of similar to the violence you see in video games.

2062
02:47:28,378 --> 02:47:30,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, who does what she does?

2063
02:47:31,919 --> 02:47:32,239
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2064
02:47:32,559 --> 02:47:40,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, we get to the show where it's time for... And it was like trying to get her last year because it was like the 20th anniversary or something.

2065
02:47:40,603 --> 02:47:42,364
[SPEAKER_04]: They were trying to get her, but I think she was pregnant.

2066
02:47:43,184 --> 02:47:43,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

2067
02:47:43,484 --> 02:47:43,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2068
02:47:43,944 --> 02:47:44,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Even better.

2069
02:47:45,265 --> 02:47:47,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't show up.

2070
02:47:47,366 --> 02:47:47,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Baby on the way.

2071
02:47:49,180 --> 02:47:51,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we're about to the end of the show.

2072
02:47:51,222 --> 02:47:55,085
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get to last-minute stories and Twitter topics and the Skype line.

2073
02:47:55,105 --> 02:47:59,769
[SPEAKER_04]: But in order to start getting the Skype calls, I've got to free up the Skype line, which means I've got to say bye to Jamie.

2074
02:48:01,991 --> 02:48:02,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

2075
02:48:02,611 --> 02:48:04,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm lusting over the Adobe Suite right now.

2076
02:48:04,833 --> 02:48:05,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go install that.

2077
02:48:06,875 --> 02:48:08,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm already installing seven programs right now.

2078
02:48:10,198 --> 02:48:14,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, save the audition license for me because I might want to check that out.

2079
02:48:14,441 --> 02:48:16,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not downloading it.

2080
02:48:17,063 --> 02:48:18,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry you had to be here remotely.

2081
02:48:18,985 --> 02:48:25,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we really like to have everybody here in studio, but with no show next week, that's a lot of Jamie to be missing.

2082
02:48:25,549 --> 02:48:27,151
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad we were able to come up with something else.

2083
02:48:27,471 --> 02:48:27,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel better.

2084
02:48:28,912 --> 02:48:30,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually am starting to feel a lot better.

2085
02:48:30,893 --> 02:48:31,994
[SPEAKER_07]: My drugs are doing the trick.

2086
02:48:32,675 --> 02:48:33,896
[SPEAKER_04]: The power of OLR.

2087
02:48:33,936 --> 02:48:34,916
[SPEAKER_04]: This show heals.

2088
02:48:35,257 --> 02:48:35,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Be healed.

2089
02:48:35,957 --> 02:48:43,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to tell you that Dan warned me about him being sick in enough time and that we had shared that soda that I started taking precautions.

2090
02:48:43,923 --> 02:48:46,265
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm not nearly as sick as I might have been.

2091
02:48:47,039 --> 02:48:48,039
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2092
02:49:10,842 --> 02:49:11,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually do not.

2093
02:49:12,142 --> 02:49:16,803
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one attached to the Sega thing, but it's a little bit outdated, so I'm not going to bother.

2094
02:49:18,064 --> 02:49:20,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2095
02:49:21,084 --> 02:49:32,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to Alabama, and if any of our listeners in or near the South with transportation would like to drive me around because I won't have a car, I'll pay for your gas.

2096
02:49:34,301 --> 02:49:36,863
[SPEAKER_04]: You're hitchhiking with OLR listeners, DarkSakura?

2097
02:49:36,903 --> 02:49:37,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what this has come down to?

2098
02:49:37,844 --> 02:49:42,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you remember one of the times I went back maybe about seven years ago?

2099
02:49:43,650 --> 02:49:46,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to Biloxi to a DDR tournament.

2100
02:49:48,514 --> 02:49:49,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I remember that.

2101
02:49:49,335 --> 02:49:53,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Where they had the fifth mix machine and they had just gotten a fifth mix and we had had it for like ever.

2102
02:49:54,554 --> 02:49:59,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was, you know, perfect attacking stuff and, you know, they're like, oh, what do you think of this?

2103
02:50:00,020 --> 02:50:01,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone was so nice.

2104
02:50:01,301 --> 02:50:06,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I love meeting the arcade folks and I got to go to my old arcade.

2105
02:50:06,207 --> 02:50:11,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to try to make it by the cyber station at the former Bel Air Mall at some point.

2106
02:50:12,213 --> 02:50:37,090
[SPEAKER_04]: you know I used to work there we may not be the most popular podcast on the internet but I really love it because you know what some podcasts out there they'll ask you for a hundred thousand dollars on kickstarter to meet stretch goals here at OLR we just want to bum a ride yeah I'm gonna be staying in Daphne which is an hour automobile and I kind of don't want to be in Daphne the whole time while my mom's at work oh gosh all right well good luck to you and uh Pixar didn't happen

2107
02:50:38,241 --> 02:50:41,022
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll probably just get pictures of oyster shells.

2108
02:50:41,322 --> 02:50:41,943
[SPEAKER_04]: It works for me.

2109
02:50:42,343 --> 02:50:42,583
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2110
02:50:42,623 --> 02:50:43,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great night, Jamie.

2111
02:50:43,503 --> 02:50:45,104
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you back in a couple weeks here on OLR.

2112
02:50:45,544 --> 02:50:46,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night, everybody.

2113
02:50:46,344 --> 02:50:46,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearts, hearts, hearts.

2114
02:50:46,965 --> 02:50:47,165
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2115
02:50:47,225 --> 02:50:47,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

2116
02:50:47,825 --> 02:50:48,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2117
02:50:48,825 --> 02:50:54,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure she'll be in chat to say good night to the listeners and so forth and finish out our show in the chat room.

2118
02:50:54,367 --> 02:50:58,669
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to stop on by, if you happen to be listening live, live.vognetwork.com.

2119
02:50:58,689 --> 02:51:04,671
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to say hi to DarkSakura in the email bag, you can always do that as well, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2120
02:51:06,612 --> 02:51:14,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the last minute stories, and I'll start to bring up the Twitter topics, and we will open up the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2121
02:51:15,455 --> 02:51:16,595
[SPEAKER_04]: We're already getting calls.

2122
02:51:17,656 --> 02:51:22,317
[SPEAKER_04]: The words had barely escaped my mouth, and we're already getting phone calls, so let's go to it.

2123
02:51:22,397 --> 02:51:23,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2124
02:51:23,517 --> 02:51:23,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2125
02:51:24,658 --> 02:51:25,198
[SPEAKER_02]: What up, guys?

2126
02:51:25,258 --> 02:51:26,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Zeno from the OKC.

2127
02:51:26,478 --> 02:51:26,878
[SPEAKER_02]: How you been?

2128
02:51:26,978 --> 02:51:27,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, ZenoCore.

2129
02:51:27,799 --> 02:51:28,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

2130
02:51:28,239 --> 02:51:28,779
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

2131
02:51:29,794 --> 02:51:31,255
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, making music here and there.

2132
02:51:31,695 --> 02:51:32,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like that.

2133
02:51:32,596 --> 02:51:32,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

2134
02:51:33,596 --> 02:51:34,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know you were... Yep, yep, yep.

2135
02:51:34,657 --> 02:51:37,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't... Or at least I didn't remember you were a music maker.

2136
02:51:37,118 --> 02:51:37,619
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

2137
02:51:38,359 --> 02:51:42,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a recent thing I picked up over the past four or five months or so.

2138
02:51:42,401 --> 02:51:42,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah?

2139
02:51:43,442 --> 02:51:43,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep.

2140
02:51:43,882 --> 02:51:45,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Got stuff up on SoundCloud.com.

2141
02:51:45,603 --> 02:51:46,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Slice Unicorn.

2142
02:51:46,364 --> 02:51:48,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out when you have availability.

2143
02:51:48,725 --> 02:51:49,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome plug.

2144
02:51:49,585 --> 02:51:50,326
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind tonight?

2145
02:51:51,749 --> 02:51:53,931
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are discussing the Let's Play situation.

2146
02:51:56,052 --> 02:52:05,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think Nintendo is going a bit overboard, although I think it's a bit of an automatic attack just due to the way that their stuff is set up.

2147
02:52:05,718 --> 02:52:14,784
[SPEAKER_02]: But taking the revenue, it's really just giving the guys a noogie on top of taking away their content.

2148
02:52:16,325 --> 02:52:17,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the way I look at it.

2149
02:52:17,666 --> 02:52:17,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,

2150
02:52:18,991 --> 02:52:19,632
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2151
02:52:33,123 --> 02:52:35,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, everybody has the luxury of doing it.

2152
02:52:35,404 --> 02:52:37,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen other companies do it before.

2153
02:52:37,605 --> 02:52:42,868
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, I mean, they'd be better off leaving it as open advertising for their games.

2154
02:52:43,008 --> 02:52:47,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because on top of that, the whole sandbox situation does apply.

2155
02:52:47,570 --> 02:52:54,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the fact that they gave a product out for play, the moment somebody starts playing it, it's completely different.

2156
02:52:54,153 --> 02:52:57,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you take Video Games Awesome Live.

2157
02:52:57,795 --> 02:53:01,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Their production for what they do on top of the game is tremendous.

2158
02:53:01,177 --> 02:53:01,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2159
02:53:01,457 --> 02:53:04,560
[SPEAKER_02]: and they do it not just for games but for releases and everything else too.

2160
02:53:04,940 --> 02:53:09,323
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're going to cut that off, they need to cut it off for all media that they do that with.

2161
02:53:10,204 --> 02:53:13,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So nobody's allowed to do anything unless they pay Nintendo some money.

2162
02:53:15,568 --> 02:53:18,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So meaning like reviews and things or what?

2163
02:53:19,286 --> 02:53:29,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, if they're not going to treat it underneath fair use, then everybody who openly plays that for longer than five minutes or so needs to pay Nintendo that.

2164
02:53:29,277 --> 02:53:33,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think, like, for instance, Revision 3, their reviews go on for eight or nine.

2165
02:53:33,982 --> 02:53:35,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, they're a big name.

2166
02:53:35,503 --> 02:53:38,146
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd never undercut them, but the little guys will step all over it.

2167
02:53:39,642 --> 02:54:01,828
[SPEAKER_04]: or that I well one thing I was kind of thinking with this is that I'm surprised a lot of people have just said all right we'll just not use YouTube because YouTube could kind of get some of the blame in this too for kind of letting Nintendo or quote-unquote letting Nintendo do it right split their videos up into what I say it's five minutes or 459 you know it's kind of a pain in the ass it's a pain in the ass but you know whatever I mean if that's what needs to be done

2168
02:54:02,552 --> 02:54:06,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's also going to cut into... The viewers aren't going to be there either.

2169
02:54:06,433 --> 02:54:11,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you have to take into account how many video game tournaments are paying rights.

2170
02:54:11,974 --> 02:54:13,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Because not that many as far as I saw.

2171
02:54:14,475 --> 02:54:16,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's sponsored by the video game company themselves.

2172
02:54:16,955 --> 02:54:19,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That means the streams for Team Spooky are also going to be cut out.

2173
02:54:20,016 --> 02:54:23,017
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can't show any of the video game tournaments as well as EVO coverage.

2174
02:54:24,524 --> 02:54:38,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that means going up against Justin.TV, and if they really want to undercut Justin.TV out of that much revenue, then they'd have a court case fight there.

2175
02:54:42,552 --> 02:54:43,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's an easy answer.

2176
02:54:43,833 --> 02:54:49,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think it's going to go back to that guy on our Facebook that said it's going to take a legal precedent to really figure this out.

2177
02:54:50,138 --> 02:55:00,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And although, sure, it was a dick move on Nintendo's part, and I think it would have just been a better situation if they've all split the money or worked with the content people to try to figure out a solution rather than sick the lawyers on them.

2178
02:55:00,946 --> 02:55:02,107
[SPEAKER_04]: That probably would have been better.

2179
02:55:02,547 --> 02:55:06,250
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, they're not the first to do so, and they won't be the last.

2180
02:55:07,011 --> 02:55:08,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, true, true.

2181
02:55:08,832 --> 02:55:09,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Other thoughts, Unicor?

2182
02:55:10,287 --> 02:55:11,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's pretty much it, man.

2183
02:55:11,487 --> 02:55:12,288
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have a good show.

2184
02:55:12,448 --> 02:55:14,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thanks for tuning in and lending your perspective.

2185
02:55:14,869 --> 02:55:15,949
[SPEAKER_04]: One more time for that SoundCloud.

2186
02:55:16,009 --> 02:55:18,030
[SPEAKER_04]: It's soundcloud.com slash xenocore?

2187
02:55:18,610 --> 02:55:18,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

2188
02:55:19,030 --> 02:55:19,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a listen.

2189
02:55:19,530 --> 02:55:20,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you'll like a lot of the stuff on there.

2190
02:55:20,811 --> 02:55:21,411
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of music?

2191
02:55:21,471 --> 02:55:21,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Chiptune?

2192
02:55:21,931 --> 02:55:22,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock?

2193
02:55:22,251 --> 02:55:22,551
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?

2194
02:55:23,192 --> 02:55:24,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's sponsored by the demo scene.

2195
02:55:24,752 --> 02:55:27,513
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I grew up with, so it tends to mirror that, but it's all over the place.

2196
02:55:27,833 --> 02:55:28,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, nice.

2197
02:55:28,513 --> 02:55:29,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it a listen.

2198
02:55:29,174 --> 02:55:29,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2199
02:55:30,598 --> 02:55:30,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

2200
02:55:30,999 --> 02:55:31,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2201
02:55:47,619 --> 02:55:50,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought you were going to say something else with this.

2202
02:55:50,222 --> 02:55:54,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Tryon Worlds announced that Rift is going free-to-play this past week.

2203
02:55:54,366 --> 02:55:54,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2204
02:55:54,807 --> 02:55:56,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that might have been where you were going with this.

2205
02:55:56,368 --> 02:55:56,809
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

2206
02:55:56,849 --> 02:56:00,773
[SPEAKER_05]: They had layoffs, so there was a lot of rumors on.

2207
02:56:00,973 --> 02:56:09,242
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't really said how many, but it was like 70%, 80% of the staff was one of the rumors, but I don't think that they said that's far exaggerated.

2208
02:56:10,468 --> 02:56:11,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

2209
02:56:11,389 --> 02:56:12,269
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another call coming in.

2210
02:56:12,309 --> 02:56:13,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2211
02:56:13,209 --> 02:56:13,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2212
02:56:14,210 --> 02:56:15,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's PrinceBrightStar.

2213
02:56:15,330 --> 02:56:16,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, PrinceBrightStar.

2214
02:56:16,190 --> 02:56:16,631
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

2215
02:56:17,251 --> 02:56:17,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.

2216
02:56:17,671 --> 02:56:17,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Yourself?

2217
02:56:18,211 --> 02:56:18,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

2218
02:56:18,491 --> 02:56:19,732
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you were going to listen more often.

2219
02:56:19,772 --> 02:56:21,552
[SPEAKER_04]: You've made good on that promise, so thank you.

2220
02:56:22,173 --> 02:56:23,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I've tried to make it every week since.

2221
02:56:23,933 --> 02:56:24,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

2222
02:56:24,334 --> 02:56:25,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's on your mind tonight?

2223
02:56:26,234 --> 02:56:30,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I've also got a comment about the whole Let's Play situation as well here.

2224
02:56:30,416 --> 02:56:31,216
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people do.

2225
02:56:31,276 --> 02:56:31,576
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

2226
02:56:32,477 --> 02:56:38,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I recently started doing Let's Play myself, particularly with Minecraft and

2227
02:56:39,680 --> 02:56:55,777
[SPEAKER_06]: also some of the Phantasy Star games I started this back in December but I have yet to monetize any of my stuff because I have yet to actually get into any of those networks but my understanding on the whole situation with Nintendo is they're even monetizing for themselves stuff from

2228
02:56:56,717 --> 02:56:59,998
[SPEAKER_06]: The IGN Network, GameStation, and such like that.

2229
02:57:00,958 --> 02:57:21,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm wondering if they have actually broken contracts in this, and if it's time for the Let's Player community to actually get together, host some sort of charity drive, or rather a donation drive, which will cover the fees for all this, the lawyer fees, and actually take this to court.

2230
02:57:21,201 --> 02:57:23,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the laws are just...

2231
02:57:24,542 --> 02:57:28,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very out of date at this point to be able to cover something like Let's Plays.

2232
02:57:29,347 --> 02:57:31,429
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean fair use laws need to be reexamined?

2233
02:57:32,310 --> 02:57:32,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2234
02:57:33,051 --> 02:57:39,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean, Nintendo may also be cutting into reviews and such which are allowed under fair use.

2235
02:57:40,413 --> 02:57:42,494
[SPEAKER_04]: What about some of the things I was saying earlier?

2236
02:57:42,654 --> 02:57:57,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't put an entire movie up and do talking over the movie, but if I wanted to do a movie review, I could obviously use little bits and pieces, which I could still do with a Nintendo game, but I can't exactly upload that to YouTube where I talk over a movie.

2237
02:57:57,844 --> 02:57:59,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it different with games?

2238
02:58:00,305 --> 02:58:01,845
[SPEAKER_06]: True, and I agree with that.

2239
02:58:02,165 --> 02:58:05,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And in that situation, you can't do it.

2240
02:58:05,826 --> 02:58:14,168
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, what most people do currently is they go and sell their tracks sort of on a site like Rift Tracks or something like that.

2241
02:58:14,508 --> 02:58:17,829
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem with video games is they're an interactive medium.

2242
02:58:18,389 --> 02:58:22,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're watching a movie, it's going to be the same for everybody regardless.

2243
02:58:23,610 --> 02:58:28,272
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're playing a video game, your experience is going to be different.

2244
02:58:29,313 --> 02:58:46,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, I respect Nintendo and any other company for doing what they want to do because it's their game, but the gameplay itself and any commentary or putting their face on the video or putting their chat on the video as well, that's their property at that point.

2245
02:58:50,207 --> 02:59:03,685
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, as a let's play person yourself, let's say something's got to give here and Nintendo wants a little piece of the pie and a little bit of the revenue, what do you think would be a solution that would make everybody happy?

2246
02:59:05,637 --> 02:59:18,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's – honestly, I think it's better that this doesn't actually go to court and each company either says you can do whatever you want or cut some sort of fee or say –

2247
02:59:21,100 --> 02:59:24,182
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do this and don't post any videos.

2248
02:59:24,242 --> 02:59:28,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it clear as to what you're allowed to do, what you're not allowed to.

2249
02:59:28,985 --> 02:59:37,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's also up to the community to respect that and not put out videos that the company states they don't want videos out there.

2250
02:59:38,952 --> 02:59:48,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially maybe for newer games, you know, having Let's Play a Bioshock Infinite before the game's actually released, when a lot of people want to know, you know, what's the ending?

2251
02:59:48,398 --> 02:59:50,299
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that could be detrimental to the game.

2252
02:59:51,340 --> 02:59:51,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2253
02:59:52,121 --> 03:00:07,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Or for, in a worst case, a game like, say, Aliens Colonial Marines, if all those reviews hadn't come out so quickly, and I realize this hurts the community even more, but with the reviews and also the embargo that was out,

2254
03:00:09,136 --> 03:00:12,589
[SPEAKER_06]: People weren't able to cancel their pre-orders before it was too late on that game.

2255
03:00:13,749 --> 03:00:14,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

2256
03:00:14,809 --> 03:00:15,049
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2257
03:00:15,089 --> 03:00:17,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, PrinceBrightStar, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?

2258
03:00:18,390 --> 03:00:19,150
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for tonight.

2259
03:00:19,350 --> 03:00:19,570
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2260
03:00:19,590 --> 03:00:20,170
[SPEAKER_04]: You take care, buddy.

2261
03:00:20,210 --> 03:00:20,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening.

2262
03:00:21,371 --> 03:00:21,611
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2263
03:00:21,771 --> 03:00:21,991
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2264
03:00:22,031 --> 03:00:22,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

2265
03:00:23,791 --> 03:00:25,291
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try to squeeze in one more call.

2266
03:00:25,311 --> 03:00:28,732
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2267
03:00:29,172 --> 03:00:29,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Other stories, Loki?

2268
03:00:30,212 --> 03:00:32,213
[SPEAKER_05]: They said there's going to be another dashboard update.

2269
03:00:32,493 --> 03:00:38,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Or there's a rumor that another dashboard update is going to come to the Xbox 360 before the next system comes out.

2270
03:00:38,914 --> 03:00:39,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2271
03:00:39,375 --> 03:00:45,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Saying that it's going to update the interface again to make it look more like Windows.

2272
03:00:46,361 --> 03:00:51,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think this could be because of some of the rumors about the set-top boxes that are going to come out really cheap?

2273
03:00:51,586 --> 03:00:56,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that, but maybe they're just trying to update it so that it looks nicer or something.

2274
03:00:56,150 --> 03:00:57,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2275
03:00:57,231 --> 03:00:58,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hate when they keep changing the interface, though.

2276
03:00:59,413 --> 03:01:01,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones and take a call.

2277
03:01:01,494 --> 03:01:02,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lens Radio.

2278
03:01:02,314 --> 03:01:02,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2279
03:01:03,134 --> 03:01:06,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is your opening act for, I guess, this is the last time, I guess.

2280
03:01:06,896 --> 03:01:07,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought the shots fired.

2281
03:01:08,656 --> 03:01:13,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let it slide this one time, but you make another Chrono Triggers better than Super Metroid joke, and it's over.

2282
03:01:14,198 --> 03:01:14,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

2283
03:01:15,198 --> 03:01:16,039
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good fun.

2284
03:01:16,099 --> 03:01:16,619
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Bobby?

2285
03:01:17,159 --> 03:01:24,822
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to repeat something that I've actually been repeating, and it's one thing that a lot of people don't realize about this whole Nintendo Let's Play thing.

2286
03:01:24,982 --> 03:01:25,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

2287
03:01:25,982 --> 03:01:30,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it's free advertising doesn't mean they have to want it.

2288
03:01:32,149 --> 03:01:35,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's something that a lot of people... They're like, oh, it's free advertising.

2289
03:01:35,593 --> 03:01:36,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't they want it?

2290
03:01:36,814 --> 03:01:37,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they don't.

2291
03:01:38,584 --> 03:01:41,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they want to control more of the advertising.

2292
03:01:41,566 --> 03:01:44,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the argument of it's free advertising, they should be happy with it.

2293
03:01:45,309 --> 03:01:51,373
[SPEAKER_03]: There's free advertising that I've gotten over the past eight years that I haven't wanted.

2294
03:01:51,493 --> 03:01:52,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that's a good analogy.

2295
03:01:53,294 --> 03:01:54,475
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good analogy.

2296
03:01:54,815 --> 03:02:06,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that sometimes, you know, like people will say something and kind of like use your site or your show or something and you're kind of like, I don't know if I would necessarily have said that myself type of thing.

2297
03:02:06,463 --> 03:02:06,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

2298
03:02:07,163 --> 03:02:08,124
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good analogy.

2299
03:02:08,864 --> 03:02:24,102
[SPEAKER_03]: so you know just because it's free advertising doesn't mean they necessarily want it and I mean the thing like the difference between like Minecraft the reason I fully support Notch for his position is because he's not telling a story in Minecraft he gave an actual sandbox

2300
03:02:25,304 --> 03:02:40,753
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're telling your own stories whereas a Let's Play of Luigi's Mansion you're telling the Luigi's Mansion story granted you're going right or left whenever you want to but you're still telling Nintendo's story

2301
03:02:42,331 --> 03:02:55,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you can say that sandbox games, you know, say if I go and just run around in Saints Row the Third and just not necessarily play in the story stuff, but just kill people or do silly stuff that that should be fair because it is telling.

2302
03:02:56,101 --> 03:02:57,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree with you on that.

2303
03:02:58,082 --> 03:03:01,805
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's different than playing the Saints Row the Third story.

2304
03:03:02,726 --> 03:03:02,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

2305
03:03:04,049 --> 03:03:05,610
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of where my line is.

2306
03:03:05,750 --> 03:03:06,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.

2307
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:10,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw it around in Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row or Minecraft.

2308
03:03:10,591 --> 03:03:12,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, that should be fair use.

2309
03:03:12,612 --> 03:03:17,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Machinima is a great example.

2310
03:03:17,574 --> 03:03:21,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Except with Microsoft's game content rules kind of...

2311
03:03:22,062 --> 03:03:24,583
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to work out with them if you're going to do Machinima.

2312
03:03:24,683 --> 03:03:27,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true, huh?

2313
03:03:27,103 --> 03:03:35,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft really laid the hammer down on that.

2314
03:03:36,346 --> 03:03:36,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2315
03:03:37,866 --> 03:03:41,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think that's all of your Let's Play people, but certainly there are some Let's Play people.

2316
03:03:41,848 --> 03:03:46,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, we did Mass Effect Drunk the other night, and maybe BioWare didn't appreciate that.

2317
03:03:46,209 --> 03:03:46,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2318
03:03:46,949 --> 03:03:48,871
[SPEAKER_05]: But once again, though, they need to get with it.

2319
03:03:48,971 --> 03:03:56,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, sorry that, you know, Microsoft's not saying that they don't want their games associated with, you know, stoners and loudmouths and stuff like that.

2320
03:03:56,538 --> 03:04:00,942
[SPEAKER_05]: But they keep saying that they keep like going back and forth what they want.

2321
03:04:01,683 --> 03:04:06,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we're going to make games that appeal to mass, you know, to, you know, core gamers and stuff.

2322
03:04:06,407 --> 03:04:07,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we're gonna make family games.

2323
03:04:07,688 --> 03:04:10,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they know what their focus is almost.

2324
03:04:10,911 --> 03:04:13,012
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to appeal to people that aren't buying their system or something.

2325
03:04:13,032 --> 03:04:14,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know what it is.

2326
03:04:14,173 --> 03:04:14,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2327
03:04:30,887 --> 03:04:33,829
[SPEAKER_04]: But what a really interesting point is that they may not want the advertising.

2328
03:04:34,089 --> 03:04:35,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kind of makes me think.

2329
03:04:35,210 --> 03:04:45,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really appreciative that there's many of you out there that put OLR in your usernames or your clan names or OLR or VOG for VOG and so forth.

2330
03:04:45,456 --> 03:04:46,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's really awesome.

2331
03:04:46,457 --> 03:04:47,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps spread the word.

2332
03:04:47,578 --> 03:04:55,263
[SPEAKER_04]: But you better not be acting like an idiot when you're doing that because then it makes people go, I don't know what this VOG thing is, but what a bunch of assholes.

2333
03:04:55,783 --> 03:04:56,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not good.

2334
03:04:57,184 --> 03:04:58,085
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the advertising we want.

2335
03:04:58,105 --> 03:04:59,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's necessarily that...

2336
03:05:00,807 --> 03:05:05,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe these people are fans of those games, and so they're excited about that.

2337
03:05:05,771 --> 03:05:08,854
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily like advertising.

2338
03:05:08,874 --> 03:05:10,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because no one needs to advertise Super Mario Bros.

2339
03:05:10,935 --> 03:05:12,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone knows what the fuck Super Mario Bros.

2340
03:05:12,657 --> 03:05:14,298
[SPEAKER_05]: is, for the most part.

2341
03:05:14,398 --> 03:05:15,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously, we've seen some...

2342
03:05:16,480 --> 03:05:22,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Some pictures from Super Mario World and Super Metroid that people don't know how to play.

2343
03:05:23,226 --> 03:05:26,228
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just saying that, for the most part, people are aware of what it is.

2344
03:05:26,288 --> 03:05:32,153
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily free advertising, but it's just a unique take on it with the Let's Play stuff.

2345
03:05:32,213 --> 03:05:36,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're just straight playing through the game without any sort of commentary on it.

2346
03:05:37,577 --> 03:05:41,800
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard to say that you're taking anything away from them, I guess.

2347
03:05:42,040 --> 03:05:42,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2348
03:05:42,621 --> 03:05:42,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

2349
03:05:43,820 --> 03:05:45,700
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's still, yeah, it's free advertising.

2350
03:05:45,720 --> 03:05:47,461
[SPEAKER_03]: But Nintendo may not want that advertising.

2351
03:05:47,501 --> 03:05:51,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe they're okay with the Let's Play community saying we're not going to do Nintendo videos anymore.

2352
03:05:51,562 --> 03:05:52,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's what they want.

2353
03:05:53,902 --> 03:05:57,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is, you know, they're kind of doing, oh, yeah, we're the good guys.

2354
03:05:57,483 --> 03:05:59,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, you didn't want to take our offer.

2355
03:05:59,144 --> 03:06:03,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, okay, have fun doing the Microsoft and the Sony stuff.

2356
03:06:03,965 --> 03:06:05,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, they won't be doing Microsoft either.

2357
03:06:07,345 --> 03:06:09,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but Microsoft hasn't gone through with YouTube.

2358
03:06:10,416 --> 03:06:11,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

2359
03:06:11,877 --> 03:06:17,260
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't, but they did kind of make the first move in this whole thing a few months ago.

2360
03:06:17,421 --> 03:06:33,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, that's even weird, though, that they would, because once again, I would see that as strange if they're going to try to put out these sort of features where they're trying to get people to broadcast on Twitch and broadcast on YouTube and stuff and share all these videos and things.

2361
03:06:33,731 --> 03:06:36,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but we don't want you to do that, or at least don't want you to make money doing it.

2362
03:06:38,354 --> 03:06:57,832
[SPEAKER_03]: well pardon me that you tell me how I should make my money Nintendo's not pulling a Sega, Microsoft's not pulling a Sega but they're just saying you can't and at least Microsoft has a licensing path so you can make money from it but you wouldn't be able to recoup the licensing costs unless you were Machinima.com or Revision3 or one of these larger sites

2363
03:06:57,912 --> 03:07:09,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what we need to do is we just need to have some sort of reform to this whole you buy the game, you get the game thing instead of it being a license because this is where all the bullshit's coming from is fucking licensing software.

2364
03:07:09,338 --> 03:07:10,819
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be you own that shit.

2365
03:07:11,740 --> 03:07:19,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that you can turn around and say, okay, I buy Halo 4, Halo 4 is mine, and I'm going to sell copies of it and claim that it's Loki's Halo 4.

2366
03:07:19,904 --> 03:07:25,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that's exactly what you're saying is that in order to own it, you have to be able to do that.

2367
03:07:26,041 --> 03:07:31,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that we can kind of come to a sort of happy medium where lawyers won't let them.

2368
03:07:32,423 --> 03:07:36,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Just straight up piracy that you at least own the stuff that you have.

2369
03:07:37,765 --> 03:07:42,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I own a car doesn't mean that I've manufactured those cars.

2370
03:07:42,366 --> 03:07:46,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't go and clone my car and expect to get away with it, but that car is mine.

2371
03:07:46,647 --> 03:07:47,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do whatever the hell I want to it.

2372
03:07:49,008 --> 03:07:49,308
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2373
03:07:49,448 --> 03:07:57,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no easy answer to this, and I'm sure the conversation will be continuing through the next few weeks, especially when we see what other companies are going to follow in Nintendo's footsteps, because I bet there'll be at least one.

2374
03:07:57,954 --> 03:08:11,643
[SPEAKER_04]: But, Bobby, before I let you go, earlier in the show we were talking about some of our predictions for Tuesday's Xbox announcements, and I was kind of curious, since you are the opening act and everything, as you say, what are your thoughts?

2375
03:08:12,984 --> 03:08:14,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I mostly agree with you guys.

2376
03:08:14,265 --> 03:08:16,867
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to... No price, no date.

2377
03:08:17,928 --> 03:08:18,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

2378
03:08:19,667 --> 03:08:23,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think Xbox Infinity is going to be the name.

2379
03:08:23,895 --> 03:08:24,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that they'll give the name.

2380
03:08:24,937 --> 03:08:26,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that they'll show a couple games.

2381
03:08:28,324 --> 03:08:56,376
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think they'll talk more about the entertainment offerings and stuff but you gotta realize this is also being broadcast live on TV so this is so they're probably gonna try to reach everything and leave a lot of the core stuff maybe to E3, I don't know I do think it's funny and I mentioned this in chat and I don't think you guys picked up on it about the Space Poncho thing they have gone full board with the Twitter handle XboxRevealTent

2382
03:08:57,438 --> 03:08:58,159
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2383
03:09:11,866 --> 03:09:12,946
[SPEAKER_03]: and fully embracing that.

2384
03:09:13,547 --> 03:09:17,848
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably going to be the Space Poncho of this year or at least that's what Microsoft hopes the Space Poncho of this year is going to be.

2385
03:09:17,868 --> 03:09:20,289
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to understand you can't force Space Poncho.

2386
03:09:20,309 --> 03:09:22,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Space Poncho is just something that happens.

2387
03:09:22,689 --> 03:09:23,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a natural thing.

2388
03:09:24,450 --> 03:09:26,390
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just make a viral video.

2389
03:09:27,151 --> 03:09:28,891
[SPEAKER_04]: The video has to go viral.

2390
03:09:29,171 --> 03:09:29,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different.

2391
03:09:30,912 --> 03:09:31,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

2392
03:09:31,912 --> 03:09:34,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, looking forward to checking out Gran Turismo 6 when it comes out?

2393
03:09:35,413 --> 03:09:36,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Gran Turismo 5 ever come out?

2394
03:09:38,994 --> 03:09:40,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I will get to play Saints Row 4.

2395
03:09:42,282 --> 03:09:42,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, yes.

2396
03:09:43,342 --> 03:09:44,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're looking forward to E3.

2397
03:09:44,563 --> 03:09:46,623
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a few weeks away.

2398
03:09:46,983 --> 03:09:48,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my appointment time.

2399
03:09:48,083 --> 03:09:48,863
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Wednesday morning.

2400
03:09:49,084 --> 03:09:49,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

2401
03:09:49,804 --> 03:09:50,904
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I'll be playing Saints Row 4.

2402
03:09:51,024 --> 03:09:53,224
[SPEAKER_03]: They said they're going to have a playable portion.

2403
03:09:53,484 --> 03:09:58,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I'm there with you so I can pick up the phone and actually call Loki after that and hand you the phone.

2404
03:09:59,346 --> 03:10:01,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got to play Saints Row 4 as well.

2405
03:10:02,246 --> 03:10:04,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded the Trouble with Clones expansion as well.

2406
03:10:05,307 --> 03:10:06,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it.

2407
03:10:06,067 --> 03:10:06,667
[SPEAKER_04]: We're ending the show.

2408
03:10:06,987 --> 03:10:09,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Bobby, any other quick final thoughts before we let you go?

2409
03:10:10,064 --> 03:10:11,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Chrono Trigger greater than Super Metroid?

2410
03:10:11,766 --> 03:10:13,969
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a bad final thought and for that I'm hanging up.

2411
03:10:14,009 --> 03:10:14,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye.

2412
03:10:15,911 --> 03:10:17,052
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be an incorrect thought.

2413
03:10:19,195 --> 03:10:19,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2414
03:10:20,376 --> 03:10:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to close up the Skype line.

2415
03:10:21,838 --> 03:10:22,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really sorry.

2416
03:10:22,518 --> 03:10:24,761
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a few of you still trying to call that didn't get through.

2417
03:10:24,901 --> 03:10:29,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very sorry but we are running a little over and I have to do some things after the show.

2418
03:10:31,247 --> 03:10:33,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Do remember you can always tweet us, twitter.com.com.

2419
03:10:33,608 --> 03:10:36,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also email us, mailbag at orange.trader.com.

2420
03:10:36,329 --> 03:10:38,210
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great way to get all of your thoughts out.

2421
03:10:39,091 --> 03:10:42,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me, speaking of Twitter, go to the Twitter real quick.

2422
03:10:42,612 --> 03:10:45,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I don't know if you had any other last-minute stories real quick here.

2423
03:10:45,313 --> 03:10:45,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

2424
03:10:45,733 --> 03:10:51,355
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a story that they're going to... I mean, they've already talked about doing this before, but they're replacing Microsoft Points with real money.

2425
03:10:51,996 --> 03:10:52,096
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

2426
03:10:53,316 --> 03:10:57,298
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw tweeting us that BlazBlue anime is getting a fall release in Japan.

2427
03:10:57,378 --> 03:10:59,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know they were making an anime about BlazBlue.

2428
03:10:59,398 --> 03:11:00,119
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.

2429
03:11:00,439 --> 03:11:01,259
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

2430
03:11:01,279 --> 03:11:04,680
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making a game for Guilty Gear, so that's pretty cool.

2431
03:11:04,760 --> 03:11:06,041
[SPEAKER_04]: A good way to kind of enhance things.

2432
03:11:06,841 --> 03:11:14,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty sending us some tweets from Asen because she was at the show and she tweeted us some pictures from Pinkberry.

2433
03:11:14,504 --> 03:11:19,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for rubbing it in, Misty, because I wish I could be there right now because that cookies and cream flavor is so good.

2434
03:11:20,266 --> 03:11:26,170
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's that free advertising that maybe Pinkberry doesn't want the advertising.

2435
03:11:26,210 --> 03:11:27,370
[SPEAKER_04]: We keep giving them on our show.

2436
03:11:27,410 --> 03:11:29,011
[SPEAKER_04]: We should stop that.

2437
03:11:29,291 --> 03:11:33,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator tweeting us his Facebook fan page for his kitty, Anakin.

2438
03:11:34,094 --> 03:11:35,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a cute cat.

2439
03:11:38,103 --> 03:11:42,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at cat pics, but I like that you set up a whole little Facebook.

2440
03:11:42,728 --> 03:11:49,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Smiling Yoshi tweets us and says, Smiling Yoshi wonders if he'll someday be subject to Nintendo's defense of copyrights.

2441
03:11:49,614 --> 03:11:51,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm a Yoshi doll, and I'm so darn cute.

2442
03:11:52,417 --> 03:11:54,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I remember this account.

2443
03:11:54,119 --> 03:11:57,322
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a Twitter account that's this little dolly Yoshi.

2444
03:11:57,342 --> 03:11:57,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2445
03:11:57,942 --> 03:11:59,325
[SPEAKER_04]: that makes all these tweets.

2446
03:11:59,826 --> 03:12:00,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really cute.

2447
03:12:00,827 --> 03:12:02,350
[SPEAKER_04]: See, there's Smiling Yoshi.

2448
03:12:02,510 --> 03:12:03,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little doll.

2449
03:12:03,652 --> 03:12:06,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine like a garden gnome that goes everywhere and tweets from all the stuff.

2450
03:12:06,537 --> 03:12:07,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have that doll.

2451
03:12:07,919 --> 03:12:08,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

2452
03:12:08,320 --> 03:12:08,560
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2453
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:11,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I should say Josh has that doll, but we have that doll in the house.

2454
03:12:12,222 --> 03:12:17,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so Smiling Yoshi is worried that maybe Nintendo is going to shut down this Twitter account.

2455
03:12:18,649 --> 03:12:19,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you have anything to worry about.

2456
03:12:20,050 --> 03:12:28,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at least, you know, I'm looking at your user icon, which is Yoshi kind of setting on your feet or a friend's feet or something like that.

2457
03:12:28,619 --> 03:12:30,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking, you know, that picture is like 5% Yoshi and 95%.

2458
03:12:34,345 --> 03:12:42,230
[SPEAKER_04]: a body in a room so I think you'd be okay I think I think that would be that would actually be okay with fair use laws just so you know

2459
03:12:43,480 --> 03:12:47,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft tweeting us, Guilty Gear XRD Sign got announced today.

2460
03:12:48,301 --> 03:12:49,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the game I was talking about.

2461
03:12:49,901 --> 03:12:51,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know there was a... Oh, okay.

2462
03:12:51,561 --> 03:13:05,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of funny, though, that name, though, you know, XRC Sign or XRD Sign, because it's like all the, you know, games have been like Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus or like, you know, they have like some sort of weird symbol after them.

2463
03:13:06,144 --> 03:13:07,724
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like XRD.

2464
03:13:07,804 --> 03:13:11,185
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like X entry into the series and some random sign.

2465
03:13:12,629 --> 03:13:14,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, a tweet from Eric RPG.

2466
03:13:14,951 --> 03:13:18,034
[SPEAKER_04]: People often say devs are high when they make game ideas.

2467
03:13:18,114 --> 03:13:20,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one put to practice, maybe.

2468
03:13:20,376 --> 03:13:24,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And he tweets us a link to something over on Destructoid about the game Demon Sheik.

2469
03:13:27,743 --> 03:13:28,424
[SPEAKER_04]: What a novel idea!

2470
03:13:48,900 --> 03:13:50,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you listen to this show every week, Eric?

2471
03:13:50,381 --> 03:13:51,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the same thing happened to us.

2472
03:13:53,302 --> 03:13:55,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's why you tweeted it to us, actually.

2473
03:13:55,563 --> 03:13:59,544
[SPEAKER_04]: If only someone would make a game like, you know, Bungie Ferret Tossing.

2474
03:13:59,584 --> 03:14:01,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we said, it ought to be a game.

2475
03:14:01,165 --> 03:14:04,606
[SPEAKER_04]: If only that was available on Xbox Live Indie Games.

2476
03:14:05,286 --> 03:14:11,888
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, Demon Sheik is apparently a crossbreed between WarioWare, Earthbound, and The Curse of Monkey Island.

2477
03:14:11,928 --> 03:14:13,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how that goes together there.

2478
03:14:14,028 --> 03:14:19,469
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess if you're a fan of Destructoid's podcast, then there's lots of lulzy in-jokes there for you.

2479
03:14:20,049 --> 03:14:21,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, fine.

2480
03:14:22,030 --> 03:14:25,011
[SPEAKER_04]: If Podtoid's gonna get a game, then you know what I want?

2481
03:14:25,351 --> 03:14:26,071
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I want?

2482
03:14:26,371 --> 03:14:27,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I want two games!

2483
03:14:29,412 --> 03:14:30,912
[SPEAKER_04]: One game isn't good enough anymore.

2484
03:14:34,429 --> 03:14:34,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2485
03:14:35,631 --> 03:14:35,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

2486
03:14:36,932 --> 03:14:39,195
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2487
03:14:39,736 --> 03:14:41,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that was it for Last Minute Stories, right?

2488
03:14:41,097 --> 03:14:41,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2489
03:14:41,498 --> 03:14:43,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show.

2490
03:14:43,660 --> 03:14:46,384
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like our show, remember, this is an indie production.

2491
03:14:46,444 --> 03:14:49,047
[SPEAKER_04]: We do do everything here, you know, for free.

2492
03:14:49,588 --> 03:14:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't really monetize the show.

2493
03:14:51,190 --> 03:14:51,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

2494
03:14:51,690 --> 03:14:54,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we ought to, but we do pay out of pocket to do the show.

2495
03:14:54,895 --> 03:14:55,696
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

2496
03:14:55,936 --> 03:14:57,078
[SPEAKER_04]: We just love the community.

2497
03:14:57,439 --> 03:14:59,802
[SPEAKER_04]: We like paying the money to spend time with our friends every week.

2498
03:14:59,962 --> 03:15:01,925
[SPEAKER_04]: All we ask, help us grow our community.

2499
03:15:01,985 --> 03:15:06,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell a friend or two about the show and help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2500
03:15:06,251 --> 03:15:07,673
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps.

2501
03:15:08,414 --> 03:15:12,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep showering DarkSakura with gifts because she really likes that too and gets her all of the glint.

2502
03:15:13,058 --> 03:15:14,219
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really awesome though.

2503
03:15:14,359 --> 03:15:16,681
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a great idea too.

2504
03:15:16,721 --> 03:15:21,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that because it's something that in turn will just help VOG in general.

2505
03:15:21,545 --> 03:15:22,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's awesome.

2506
03:15:22,967 --> 03:15:27,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, before we close up shop, we've got to go around and get final thoughts.

2507
03:15:27,811 --> 03:15:28,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2508
03:15:29,932 --> 03:15:38,776
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is that I showed quite a bit of self-restraint in this digital games mayhem sale on Amazon.

2509
03:15:39,256 --> 03:15:41,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I didn't buy a lot of this.

2510
03:15:42,618 --> 03:15:44,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I buy random weird shit.

2511
03:15:44,379 --> 03:15:45,619
[SPEAKER_05]: But I only bought two things.

2512
03:15:45,739 --> 03:15:51,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought the Sam & Max collection, which is all three seasons of Sam & Max.

2513
03:15:51,622 --> 03:15:54,603
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like 18 episodes of gaming to play.

2514
03:15:54,783 --> 03:15:58,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Saints Row 2, because I didn't have it yet on Steam.

2515
03:15:58,245 --> 03:15:58,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

2516
03:15:59,586 --> 03:16:00,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that'd be pretty good.

2517
03:16:00,827 --> 03:16:06,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and, I need people to give me suggestions for game night.

2518
03:16:06,972 --> 03:16:09,674
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because otherwise I'm just gonna pick something at random.

2519
03:16:10,075 --> 03:16:13,978
[SPEAKER_05]: It may end up being Call of Duty or something, because I can't think of...

2520
03:16:15,359 --> 03:16:15,799
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2521
03:16:35,737 --> 03:16:38,858
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it'll be like 8, 8.30ish.

2522
03:16:39,698 --> 03:16:49,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think that way we can play a lot longer because, you know, we won't have to worry about, you know, the work day next day for most people.

2523
03:16:50,541 --> 03:16:54,902
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yes, let me know on the forums what you want to play so we can consider that.

2524
03:16:56,411 --> 03:17:00,075
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple final thoughts from me.

2525
03:17:00,795 --> 03:17:03,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I will echo what Bobby Blackwolf in chat is saying.

2526
03:17:03,137 --> 03:17:06,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Some VOG announcements coming on June 2nd, so stay tuned for that.

2527
03:17:07,221 --> 03:17:11,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Horde House has a big surprise this week, so tune in on Wednesday at 7 o'clock Pacific to hear that.

2528
03:17:11,846 --> 03:17:13,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess just plugs from me.

2529
03:17:13,707 --> 03:17:14,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

2530
03:17:15,709 --> 03:17:18,352
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2531
03:17:18,692 --> 03:17:24,116
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be back probably in two weeks, but stay tuned to our Twitter just in case we're able to pull out a show during Memorial Day weekend.

2532
03:17:24,136 --> 03:17:24,657
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let you know.

2533
03:17:25,017 --> 03:17:26,598
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, have a great week.

2534
03:17:27,399 --> 03:17:30,000
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you in the States, have a great three-day weekend on Memorial Day.

2535
03:17:30,321 --> 03:17:33,623
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you throughout the rest of the world, have a great week, whatever you're doing.

2536
03:17:33,863 --> 03:17:35,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And E3's almost here, you guys.

2537
03:17:35,665 --> 03:17:36,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of gaming news coming at you.

2538
03:17:38,487 --> 03:17:40,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Brace yourselves for this Xbox thing on Tuesday.

2539
03:17:40,548 --> 03:17:41,269
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be interesting.

2540
03:17:41,609 --> 03:17:44,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great week, everybody, and have fun.

2541
03:17:45,032 --> 03:17:45,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2542
03:17:46,081 --> 03:17:49,103
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2543
03:17:49,744 --> 03:17:53,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

2544
03:17:54,567 --> 03:18:03,433
[SPEAKER_01]: To join us for a live show, tune in to VOGnetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

2545
03:18:04,053 --> 03:18:15,501
[SPEAKER_01]: The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

2546
03:18:16,501 --> 03:18:18,162
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week!
