DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, May 5th, 2013, one Wii U game finally goes free to play in the US.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Could more be coming?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Could creators of Nyan Cat Sue one video game maker?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And could Respawn's next game be an Xbox exclusive?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number 503 for May the 5th of 2013.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Happy Cinco de Mayo to you guys.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
And on behalf of all Americans, I'd like to apologize to Mexico for Chevy's.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Because what is, seriously, what is Chevy's?

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Delicious? They have like the salad that I freaking like.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
And that corn stuff that I'm allergic to, I freaking love.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
You bite your, you shut your whore mouth.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
The voice of reason over there telling me to shut my whore mouth.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
The one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Rob's mouth is a dirty whore.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
You know, people can take that a lot of different ways and I don't appreciate you slandering me on this program.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Your mouth is a freshly brushed whore.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
What is that even supposed to mean?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
It means it's clean. You brush your teeth.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, who I will not call names for one minute.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
I think Reggie has sent you a secret Cinco de Mayo message because apparently your Wii is glowing.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Oh, that Wii has been glowing for like two weeks.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
No, actually, not even that. About a week.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
And honestly, my honest reaction when that thing started glowing blue,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
and I already know what the message is thanks to a news story coming up later,

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
but when it started glowing blue, my honest reaction was it was plugged in.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I swear to God, I was like the Wii was plugged in.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
I thought I unplugged it after I moved all the,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
well, because there's literally nothing left on my Wii.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
I did the little Pikmin transfer thing to my Wii U because I wanted the discount on the virtual console games.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
So there's no reason for me to have the Wii except to use, what,

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
forecast channel and spin the globe and see what the weather's like in South Pole.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And then in June, they're pulling the plug on that.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
So I won't even be able to see what the weather's like in the South Pole anymore

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
unless I actually pull up an internet web browser and look at weather.com or whatever.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
What do you have that I have in my hand right now? You have an iPhone.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
A microphone.

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
All you have to, bite me, all you have to do is just put in, like, Antarctica on your phone and, hold on.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
Siri, you whore, what is, nothing, what is the temperature in Antarctica?

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm gonna see if Siri will answer. God, fucking Siri.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah, yeah, how great, yeah, how fucking wonderful.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Oh!

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I can't find things in Antarctica. Can you be more specific?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah, you bitch.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah, that awesome device you have in your hand. Yeah, technology, so great, innit?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
The joys of live radio.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah, no one can see me flip off, Rob.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Also, say hello to our live audience and the ever-present fourth guest on our program,

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
the chatters, live.vognetwork.com.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Once again, that's live.vognetwork.com.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Misty started us off tonight saying, fucking Siri indeed. See?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
There you go, all the VOG listeners hate Siri, confirm.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, I feel so bad for True, having your first card being 84 Mustang,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
which is like one of the worst years for Mustangs.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
Tiger Claw on chat says, did you see this week's SNL's weekend update

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
when they made fun of Google Glasses?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, what do you think about that whole Google Glasses thing?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I think it's too expensive.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah, do we know the price on those yet?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Aren't they like three grand?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
$1,500.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah, it was something, I knew it was at least over $1,000, so.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, and I think you have to be like cordially invited to test it out, too.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
That's like, if I had that kind of money, I'd just say, fuck it, Club 33.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Well, it's just because I didn't reply back to their tweets or whatever.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Are you supposed to say it on Google Plus? I'm not really sure how that works.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
So they're like, I want to record everything I do.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Okay, we'll give you one for free.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Yeah.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
VXJ6V in chat says, Rob Roberts, you skipped Loki? No, I didn't.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I said I would not make fun of him for a whole week.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Remember when I talked about the glowing light on the Wii? Where were you?

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
Well, remember, Colorado did just recently legalize a little something something.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm kidding. I know Jason's not into that. Let's see.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
What was the other comment? Oh, SH2100Matt says, Jamie just wishes Siri was more like Edie.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
No, I do not.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
True. True facts. She might not be Joker.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
I want the Seth Green voice for my phone because that would be real.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Actually, no, I want GLaDOS for my phone so that I can get directions while I'm being berated.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Can't you get like a GLaDOS GPS thing? I think I saw that somewhere.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
You know what else they have? They have a SpongeBob one.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
And I went to a pinball event and the guy had one.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
And I was like, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
All right. Before we get into our gaming weeks, which we always start off the show with,

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
I thought maybe we could start tonight by talking about the Ouya,

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
which is this ongoing saga of Loki's where you are one of the first few thousand people

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
that backed the Ouya, right?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Number 1226.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Which, in the scope, how many people actually pre-ordered it?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
63,000 something. Well, 63,000 people backed it.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Most of them backed it with getting a console.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Right.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
So, I'm sure it's a little less.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
So, you were still one of the first few.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, it was the first day.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
So, you finally got your Ouya after waiting a couple weeks and what happened?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
It took like a month.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
They sent me a ship. It was going to ship like back in April.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
I don't remember. It was like the second week of April or something.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
And it took like two weeks to get here.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
But it's here.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
It's here now.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
So, you got it this week. You were putting some YouTubes up, right?

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, I was putting up YouTubes because there's not really a whole ton of information.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
What's your username on YouTube? LokiOLR.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
LokiOLR.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah, so I've got like four YouTube videos on there.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Okay, here's how I was shooting these videos.

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
We were still playing games over in our game room, which is basically an empty half of a building that we don't use anymore.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
So, it's just me over there when I go to play games.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
And then, so I used two office chairs with that box and that Xbox 360 controller and leaned my phone against it.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
And just to give you guys some perspective, this Ouya came in like literally a shoebox.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Like I would expect to see shoes in there.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah, it's a shoebox. Sort of, yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And the Ouya itself is a tiny little thing.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
They say it's about the size of a Rubik's Cube.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Dark Soccer was balancing it on her head earlier and I would say...

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm going to take a picture of it in comparison to the coffee cup.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah, it's about the size of the coffee cup. Actually, the coffee cup's bigger.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
The coffee cup is bigger.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Which shows you...

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm going to put my iPad behind it.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
Which shows you the priorities of our caffeine intake here at OLR.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
So, Dark Soccer's going to take a picture for OrangeNoseRadio.com right now.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Does that go to Tumblr too when you do that?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
It can.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Okay.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
So, yeah. So I got it and I did the firmware update that they had on there.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And started downloading games.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
And then like one of the first few days I started trying to sideload stuff.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Because I wanted to see what exactly you could sideload on it.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
It's weird because they don't really have a way to root it.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Although you're supposed to be able to root it straight out of the box and be able to do everything with it.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
But it's still very early. I would still consider this like a beta test.

07:48.000 --> 07:56.000
And for any outlet out there, especially Polygon or any of those guys to be reviewing this as an actual retail release.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
It's so fucking retarded. It's mind boggling.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
So when you actually power this thing on for the first time, what happens? What does it look like?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Is there a polished interface at all?

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah, there's an interface. Basically, first you have to sync your controller.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
So it says push the button on your controller until two lights show up.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And you do that. It's really painless.

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
And then once you've done that, you set up your wifi if you don't have it hooked up to the ethernet.

08:25.000 --> 08:33.000
So you set up your wifi and then you either create an account or you log into an existing account with Ouya.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
If you need to have it or not.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
So I had an account already so I logged into mine and that's it.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
And then you're greeted. Well, I had to do a system update after that.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
So you do a system update and then you go back to the main menu.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
And then you have four menu options you get to choose from.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
They have one that's basically settings.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
They call them all different things like manage or something.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
They have a section that's make, which is basically all the side loaded stuff.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
Where if you're developing a game for Ouya, it's where you would dump your APKs and stuff.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And where you'd be able to play that stuff.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
And then there's discover, which is their store.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
They have that. And then play, which is going to be all your games.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
So I went to the store and just downloaded everything.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
As much as I could.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
And there was some stuff that I wanted to play since I'd seen video of it.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
One of my first downloads was No Breaks of L.A.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Because I was like, this looked hilarious on the video when I saw it.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And yeah, it's pretty hilarious.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Is the Final Fantasy 3 on there yet?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I have Final Fantasy 3, I have the demo for it.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I've been paying $15 for that.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
And that's the thing too. I've downloaded everything I've downloaded so far.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I've not had to put any of my credit card information in yet.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
So you don't have to put it in until you want to actually buy something.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I think they changed that too in one of the very first.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
They had the whole rabble rabble on the internet about that.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And it changed pretty quick.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And you can go in and change that stuff.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
And I think you can even remove it at any time or something.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
So what about the hacking and all this?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
It's supposed to be this whole open thing.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Did you get in there and try to figure out?

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
The first question I asked you was, did you get the emulators working?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Yeah, I have the emulators. I wasn't really...

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
It's emulators, so I haven't really bothered.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I know what Mario Kart 64 looks like.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
I'm not in a huge hurry to put that on there yet.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Sometimes the emulators can be a little crappy.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I do want to play with it.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
It's like they have GSNES, which I recognize that as a PC thing.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
And they have, I think, SNES 9X on there.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't remember what the Nintendo 64 one was.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
And they just added one for the DS, which I don't know how the hell that would work.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
But I guess it will.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And what else?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Some other cool things I found out about it.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
You can sync Xbox 360 controllers and PlayStation 3 controllers to it.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Oh nice.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Although I have not gotten that to work correctly.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
I noticed though, the Ouya controller, you were letting me kind of get a feel for it.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
It's not that bad.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
It's not bad. The only thing that bothers me a slight little bit is just the shoulder buttons.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
The shoulder buttons just kind of feel weird because they're big and fat.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
And so it's a little strange to me.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
But, you know, they work.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
So, I don't know. It'll be alright.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But all the directional buttons...

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
I'm not even really a big deal about the letters being different on there.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
They're the same colors as the Xbox 360 stuff.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
So I just go by color anyway.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
So I'm like, okay.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
You pick it up in like a second and that's it.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It's not that jarring.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
It's like going between the PS3 and the 360.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
It's not that big a deal.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
But yeah, they have like one game.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
It supports up to like eight players with the 360 and the PS3 stuff.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Although, see, the PS3 controllers do work.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
But I can't get both of them synced.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Because when I try to sync a PS3 controller to it, my Ouya controller becomes unsynced.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
And it's supposed to be able to just add it as a second controller.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
But I'm not doing something right.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't really know what it is.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
That's not a big deal.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I mean, it's not something that's really officially supported anyway.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
But, you know, games...

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I've checked out some of the games on there.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
They're pretty cool.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I side-loaded Grand Theft Auto 3.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Which is... it works.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
I haven't played 3 on my phone.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
So I don't know how...

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Actually, I did play 3 on my iPod one time.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
But then I was like, this is way too big.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And it doesn't work very well with the touch control, so I deleted it.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
I asked about Final Fantasy 3 specifically because I've played the DS version of that.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
I've emulated the NES one from way back in the day with the translation patch.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
But more recently, I've played the iPhone, iPad version of it and the DS version.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
So I'm kind of curious how the Ouya one compares.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I'm sure it's probably the same.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Especially if it's Android.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
I don't remember if Square released that on Android, but I wouldn't be surprised.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I think they have.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
So I checked out why I've downloaded that.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I haven't gotten a chance to play it.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I played a game called The Ball, which is alright.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It's kind of like a puzzle game.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
A first-person puzzle game, similar to Portal or something like that.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Except without the portals.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
I played a game called Phase, which is also a little similar to Portal.

13:21.000 --> 13:29.000
You change the phase of your shield or whatever and you can go in between certain force fields.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
And if you have it in the opposite phase, those force fields are solid.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
So you have to play with that mechanic and stuff.

13:36.000 --> 13:43.000
I played this Pingu poker game, which is something I'll probably be reviewing soon.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
It's pretty fun.

13:45.000 --> 13:54.000
It kind of reminded me of a poker RPG game that was on the iOS platforms.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I don't remember what that was called.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
Puzzle poker, or Swords and Poker, that's what it was.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
You used to love the hell out of that game on iOS.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
This is not necessarily like that.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
It's not an RPG or anything.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
It's basically a combination of poker and bingo.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
You have so many cards, and so you're making hands based on the way you'd score in bingo.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Clarifying comment from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Game Guru says,

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Squeenix did release Final Fantasy 3 on the Amazon store, I believe.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
That makes sense.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Why not? If people are going to pay the $15 for it, go for it, right?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah, I think they probably released it everywhere.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Okay, so to try and wrap up, because this is only a three-hour show.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
You paid, what, $100?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
What was your donor note?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
$99 for this a year ago.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Here's your Ouya.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
How do you feel?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Worth it?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
It's alright.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Situation to tell?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
It's alright.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
It's a little soon to tell.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
I mean, it's kind of like a console that plays Xbox Live Indie games.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
That's pretty much it.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
I mean, they're going to have some exclusive stuff eventually.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Which is alright.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
I mean, in some of it, it's kind of like, woo, yeah.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
With Microsoft clearly sunsetting that whole thing, unless we get surprised on the 21st.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
With Microsoft clearly, that's a great vision for the console.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
What this reminds me of.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
It reminds me of this looks-wise.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
And I'm not saying this to insult the machine.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
Aesthetically, it looks like those weird kind of blingy stuff that they give you at employee fairs.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
When they open up your medical benefits and they try to give you stuff to advertise whatever the provider is.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
I thought you got little squishy stress balls from that stuff.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
You get squishy balls and sometimes you get like...

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Okay, if that squishy ball was in a square shape with a rounded edge, yes.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
It looks like a cup holder that I got from one of those things.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Okay, I'm with you there.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
If you were to take the top off, that looks like a thing that literally sits on my desk at work that holds my pants.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Some other things about the console.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
It doesn't just do games. Of course it does other applications.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I mean, you can pretty much load anything you want on it.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
It's got Twitch on there right now.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
So you can actually view Twitch streams and stuff through that.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
It's got... I don't know if it's Stitcher.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Some radio thing I don't actually listen to a lot.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
But I recognize the app. I just don't listen to any of these radio apps except for Pandora.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
But it's got a radio app on there. A music thing.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
And Minecraft worked great on it.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Except the controls don't work because right now they have the controls locked to just the...

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
Well, the controller stuff, they have it locked to the Sony one that...

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
What was it? The...

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
What the fuck is that called?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
The Sony... Remember their stupid...

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Almost like the PSP phone, but it wasn't the phone.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Oh, yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Experience play or something.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
So they have it locked to that.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
And a future update is going to update it with controller support.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
And I think it'll run.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
But it runs smooth.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
It runs smooth. You can use...

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Because it has a touch pad on the actual controller.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
So you can use that to click the buttons a little bit.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
And there's also other apps I can get, I think, where I can map stuff to the buttons.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
But I haven't bothered to try that yet.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
So during the break tonight here in the studio in about an hour, we're going to plug that in real quick.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
It's really easy to set up, right?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah, it's just HDMI and a power cord.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
So we should be able to throw that in the TV real quick.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
And during the break, just take a look at it because I'm dying to see what this is.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
The retail release of this is in what? June? Supposedly?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
June 4th, supposedly. And they keep saying that they're not going to be late.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
I think they're going to delay it.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
But right now they're saying June 4th.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Isn't that like right before E3?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
It's an interesting time to...

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
It is, but...

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
That's so Saturn.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Well, the thing is, it's not something that really needs a huge fanfare.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Because this is all a lot of these games.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I mean, everything's basically built by the community anyway.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
So...

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
No, I mean...

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
It'll be interesting.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
And there's stuff that they have, like they have MMOs that have been ported over from it and stuff.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
So I can show you some of the apps on there.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And there's apps coming on there every day.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
It'll be neat.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Well, you sound pretty enthusiastic about it even though you just said you're on the fan.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I'm not that excited.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Well, here's the thing.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
This isn't going to be something I'm going to be playing all the time.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
It'll be something I'll go back to every now and then.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
Because now that I've gotten a little bit more comfortable with playing on PC with a lot of...

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Because I buy a lot of Steam crap.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I buy a lot of Steam crap.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
You and everybody else, Loki.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Especially when it's sale time.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I'm going in and actually starting to play a lot of that Steam crap that I bought.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
So...

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
You know.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't know.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
There's stuff I like on there.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
And it's all...

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I'll try to run.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
You know, play around with it.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Good question from True in our chatroom.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Live.vognetware.com.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Does the Ouya not run hot?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
No, they've got a big fan in the bottom.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
There's actually like a fan vent in the bottom.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Well, yeah.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
They have it weighted.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
They have it weighted on purpose so that it doesn't tip over when you plug the cords in the back.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Smart.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
There is a lot of kind of quirky, smart design in it.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Like, I love the controllers with the batteries inside.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
The other thing about the controllers is they have aluminum face plates on them.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
And they're nice and cool.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
That's the other thing I like.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
Because if your hands get warm, these controllers stay kind of nice and cool.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
And they're comfortable.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
The other thing, like I said, I'm not a huge fan of are the shoulder buttons.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
But they work.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
I just, you know, wish they were a little bit thinner.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
That's the important part.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Alright.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Well, even though Loki has been talking about his gaming week of sorts.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
We do usually start off the show with a little bit more formal.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
How was your gaming week?

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
But I wanted to get the Ouya thing out because you've been posting to Twitter all about it this week.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And so I want to get that update right off the bat.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Let's talk about what else we've been playing this week.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Dar Sakura, we'll start with you.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Well, I'm doing a regular Mass Effect 3 stream on Thursday night.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Can we talk about streaming for a minute?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Sure.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I want to give a shout out to Bobby over at the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Of course, before us here at VOG Network.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
And my buddy DJ Tyrant on Twitter recommended a program to me that I liked way better than the one I was using.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
It was called OBS, open broadcasts, and I get such a better frame rate on that.

19:45.000 --> 19:52.000
But is it just me or like, I mean, I know this whole like streaming game thing has been kind of growing over the past couple of years.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
But I really feel like in the past couple months, it's exploded.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Like everybody's doing game streams.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's just very interesting to me that it's become so easy and so many people are doing it.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
Like, you know, you all three of us have been doing game streams at certain times.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Bobby's been doing it. And not only are you talking about just like even our listeners.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
I see a lot of the Twitter, you know, things like, come see my Twitch TV. It's just, it's so easy.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
It's not just gaming either because I've seen art streams.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Podcast recordings. A lot of people who don't have a set up like the network or whatever do that.

20:26.000 --> 20:35.000
When Depeche Mode's album was about to come out, my friend Amanda, who does a lot of stuff for their official fan club, got to preview the album on a live stream.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
And got to basically do a live stream preview of the new album, play all the music on it. It was really good.

20:42.000 --> 20:53.000
But yeah, I think, I honestly think it's good because, I mean, the thing that I always like is if it's a game that I've seen, you know, 50,000 times, I like seeing people kind of rip it apart.

20:53.000 --> 21:00.000
Sort of do the MST3K thing, which is pretty much what I do when I go stream, is yell at people in the game who can't hear me.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
Tigerclaw on chat says, yeah, which is why I love it. So many games to watch people play.

21:06.000 --> 21:13.000
And what was the comment? Oh yeah. And Tigerclaw had started that off at our chat room saying, if only you could stream the Ouya on Twitch so we can see it.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
I don't have the capture card for the TV yet, but that's on the list of want to get in future.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
One of my buddies sent me a link to a good one that she uses.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Oh, nice.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
I'm getting one event soon. They'll do HDMI capture.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
You guys missed a pretty good stream on, I think it was Friday night. Oh my gosh. We were playing Mass Effect.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
And you didn't invite me?

21:33.000 --> 21:40.000
I had problems getting started. Well, the whole thing was that Shane was going to get drunk and it took him about 20 minutes.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
The stream lasted an hour. That's, I mean, he was gone. He passed out.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Wow.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
But it was, it was pretty funny. So there was a few that were there. I got to see it.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
So we need to do Wednesday night multiplayer.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
Oh, let's see. We got to, yeah, we got to dance around all the live shows on the stream, but yeah.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
So can I continue?

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Yes, I'm sorry. I just want to talk about, I'm trying to promote your streaming site.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Poor Shane. Whatever.

22:05.000 --> 22:16.000
But yeah, I've started doing that just because I don't, I get bored and usually, sometimes it's Dan's day off, but a lot of times he'll have a Wednesday where he works late.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
So, you know, I'm there by myself. What's the, you know, what's the problem? I'll hop on and chat with people and yell at video games.

22:25.000 --> 22:34.000
Then I, we got an iCade. Dan, and I saw you ordered yours. Dan ordered an iCade because Amazon has them for 44 bucks.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
And we're talking about marked down by about $100.

22:39.000 --> 22:46.000
So I went on a purchasing rampage trying to buy games that would work on it because I had none.

22:46.000 --> 22:55.000
And it was pretty stupid of me because I spent like the last of my play cash on going to the baseball game last night too, which was really good.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
But I got Pac-Man, the Atari's Greatest Hits. I already had Fix-It Felix, but I can't figure out how to get it to work.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
Metal Slug 3, the Midway Arcade, Blazing Star, and the Namco Arcade.

23:05.000 --> 23:13.000
So I bought one game on the Namco Arcade, which was Galaga. I tried playing Starblade with the iCade and Starblade doesn't work.

23:13.000 --> 23:21.000
Like a lot of these will have like a one day demo thing that you can play through unless you buy tokens or the full version of the game.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
And for most of these, the full version of the game is like a couple bucks.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Metal Slug 3 was about $5. It was worth it.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
I thought of another game that supports, I think supports iCade that you might not have. It's the Activision Collection.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
And I think Kaboom is free on that. I don't remember. One of the games is free that you get with that.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I've got plenty right now.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
When you told me the iCades were on sale, I ordered one.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
So I'm getting it Monday. I'm excited.

23:47.000 --> 23:55.000
Because I grabbed an app in the marketplace called Gridley a couple months ago, which is just the MAME emulator in disguise.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
And I know a lot of you guys are like, but emulators are bad.

23:59.000 --> 24:07.000
But I support the real deals too. But since there aren't a lot of real deals on iOS for these things, I can't wait.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
My cocktail cabinet on the bar top is just collecting dust at my work.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
Let's be real guys. Are they ever going to put out Miss Nude World 96 as an app? I doubt it.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
It has Miss Nude World 96 on it too.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
The only way I will ever get to play Miss Nude World 96 is to turn to the dark side. Sorry, Jamie.

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
Okay. I'm probably going to be cancelling well.

24:34.000 --> 24:43.000
Because unless these bastards don't ever get back to me, because I have been trying and trying and trying.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Ragnarok Online 2 went into free to play.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
I saw that and I thought of you this week on Steam.

24:48.000 --> 24:55.000
So I tried. And I had registered through whatever Gravity's new site is for it.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
And so now I can't register it through Steam.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
And it's in the same freaking problem that it had back with the old IRO.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
Was that you can't find the installer anywhere.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
And I tried to download from one of their mirrors and it kept quitting on me.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
So I'm like, I could download the Steam one fine, but I couldn't run it.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
And so it says, if you have problems, email, blah, blah, blah.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I'm like, not replying to me yet. So I don't know what to do.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
So I'm really supremely pissed.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
And I still need to update my PSO2.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
God, I played something else. I don't remember.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Alright.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Seriously.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Then we'll go over to Loki.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I played a few things.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
I finally installed, granted that a...

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
I tried installing Andreas on there.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
And I got it to work, but mapping the buttons to the Xbox 360 controller are...

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
It's pretty much impossible to get it to work correctly.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
So I kind of gave up on that.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
I'm still trying to get my copy back from my sister, but she put it in storage.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
So I have to get it.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
What was she thinking putting your game in storage?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I basically gave her the PlayStation 2.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I guess siblings can get away with that a little more.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
That's fine. I'm not a huge fan of Andreas. I've already played it.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
I wanted to play it on PC because I have it on PC, but I can't map the buttons correctly.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
They have a program to do it, but it doesn't work right and you have to un-patch the game.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
It's just a pain in the ass, so I'm just not worrying about that.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
I got four episodes from Liberty City on there.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
I played it for a little bit and I'm like,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Cool, I'm going to play episodes from Liberty City and I'm going to play Deathmatch.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And I'm going to totally dominate Deathmatch.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
And there's no one on fucking line anymore.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
There's nobody, nobody at all playing any sort of ranked Deathmatch or Deathmatch or anything.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
It's all fucking free mode.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
Free mode's fun, but I want to play a competitive game in Grand Theft Auto.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
And I can't do that anymore because no one plays it.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Which is why I need Grand Theft Auto 5.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
And it's such a fucking cock tease to have three fucking trailers and extended previews all over the god damn internet.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I need this game. It's my crack.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I need it. I'm feended for this game.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
So yeah, Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to be awesome.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
I can't wait to play it.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
I guess I don't even need to ask about those trailers that came out this week and how you felt.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Oh, they're fantastic.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
I think you made it pretty clear.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
It's fantastic.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
Well, even there was like a 90 minute kind of talking about it.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
Because basically everyone was shown about 30 minutes of gameplay.

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
That talked everything about from the mechanic between switching between each protagonist in the game.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
And how they're...

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
You know, the map is about five times the size of Red Dead Redemption.

27:40.000 --> 27:46.000
One and a half times of Red Dead Redemption's worth in the ocean.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Under the ocean, actually.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
So there's a lot of scuba diving in the game.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
You can pretty much do whatever...

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
I mean, you can do whatever you want in the game, but it's just so much to explore.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
It's just gonna...

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
It's gonna be awesome.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
And just a lot of mechanics in the game sound really good.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
Like the heists and how you have to do missions to kind of do recon on different things.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
And set up the actual heists and you hire your people to help you out.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
It just looks like a very good game.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And a very good storyline going along with that.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Actual games I played.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Saints Row the Third.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
I'm still trying to go through and finish off my achievements that don't involve co-op.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
But I'm just getting so bored with a lot of these games that...

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Like, I don't know what I want to play anymore.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
Because I can't think of anything that I want to play that sounds exciting.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
You know, like Grand Theft Auto V.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
I can't think of anything other than Saints Row IV and Grand Theft Auto V and maybe Earth Defense Force 2025.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
But none of those are coming out yet.

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
And so I'm kind of in this weird position where, yeah, I'm just kind of going on autopilot and playing stuff.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
I don't really want to play, but I'm kind of playing it anyways.

28:51.000 --> 28:58.000
One thing I did notice on Saints Row the Third, though, is their AI pathing doesn't account for the fact that there's...

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
A section in the game, or actually a very large section in the game, where they raise the bridges in the game.

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
So that, you know, because it's a security thing and they're trying to, like, trap the Saints on the island and stuff.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
And the cars don't realize that the bridge is up.

29:13.000 --> 29:22.000
So they keep trying to go up the bridge and they just crash and crash and crash and then explode and crash again.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
And it was hilarious. It's like standing there watching the cars just try to go straight.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
That sounds like some Driver 3 shit right there.

29:28.000 --> 29:36.000
That almost inspired me to even bring my singing voice and do, like, a Buggy Saints Row the Third, you know.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
That is begging for the Benny Hill theme.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
It's just seriously like, what? This is so terrible.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
There's even a mission I had to do where I had to stop this. Basically, it's an assassination mission.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
You have to kill this guy before he kills him. He's going to commit suicide by jumping off the bridge.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
And so she needs to collect the money, you know, insurance money, but, you know, it's null and void if he commits suicide.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
But the bridges are up, so he spawns in the water. He's not dead.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
I mean, he wouldn't even die from that drop because it's not that big of a drop. It's just like a small bridge.

30:05.000 --> 30:12.000
And so I just had to make my way around to shoot him from the side of the, you know, the shore.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
But it was just so stupid and buggy. It just all messed up.

30:15.000 --> 30:22.000
Or, like, I was supposed to do this other assassination mission where I was supposed to dress up like one of the gangs, the Deckers.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
And so I go to my hideout because I don't even, I can't seem to find the clothing option to put it on and all.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
And so I'm sorting through my wardrobe and stuff and all of a sudden I start getting shot.

30:31.000 --> 30:42.000
I'm like, what the hell is going on? And I look and the guy that I'm supposed to be assassinating somehow came into my safe house and just starts shooting at me.

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
I'm like, how the fuck did this guy even get here in the first place? He's not even supposed to be coming after me yet because I don't have the right outfit on.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I haven't even found this guy. It's just ridiculous.

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
You know, I know people have their opinions on you and your strong opinions about Nintendo and other things.

30:56.000 --> 31:02.000
But, you know, it's amazing to me how when you really like a game, you will make that game last forever.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
I've bought it, like, on two platforms already.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Oh, that's great.

31:06.000 --> 31:14.000
So I've, I don't know. So anyways, and then beyond that, Ouya played lots of games on the Ouya and we talked about a lot of those already.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
And what else did I play this week? More Call of Duty.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
I actually am playing through a little bit more of the story campaign on three, which is it's all right.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
It's just it's Call of Duty. They don't have a great, they don't have a great story.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
I mean, it's cinematic. It's kind of fun. You don't play Call of Duty for the story.

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
No, you don't really. You don't really play for the story. You play for the act. It's just watching, like, an action movie. I mean, come on.

31:37.000 --> 31:44.000
And Minecraft X-Ray LA, because we did a VOG gaming night, actually had so much show this time. Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
That's all right. It's all good.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
I really wanted to go, but I had to work on one of my other projects that night.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
It's all good.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
But you're doing Forza this week, right?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
This week we're doing Forza Horizons.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I will be there.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
I'll bring out more people, so.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
I'll be there.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
Forza Horizon this Thursday, 8 p.m. Pacific time. Probably goes for about two hours.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
So at least that's how long I can play.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
I might not be there right at 8, but I'll be there.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
That's all right.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
All right. Yeah.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Okay, before we get to my gaming week, Dark Soccer, you wanted to add one.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
I did forget one more. Tomb Raider.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
The new one.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Yeah, which I have now officially stolen Alan's name for it. It's Girl.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Or what is it, Lara Croft?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Lara Croft's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
And how was it?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
BCPC sale on Steam this weekend, right?

32:22.000 --> 32:29.000
Yeah, it's half price, so since I had a lovely gift from Loki, thank you, of $20 in my Steam wallet.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
And no pressure at all from Tim, who was here last week.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
Well, I intended on getting it eventually anyway, but I only paid $8 for it, so.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Nice. All right.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Good times with it?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
That poor girl.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
The opening sequence, you're like, damn.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
Like, how could your day get worse? Oh, let's fall off a plane.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
You could get impaled by a tree.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I probably died five times at the beginning of the game.

32:51.000 --> 32:56.000
Yeah, but it's not the end of the world. Like, the death isn't super frustrating in that game.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
And it starts you pretty much right from the section you left off on.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Right.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
But I need to find the picture on my Tumblr and post it in chat for everybody.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Sounds good. Live.vognetwork.com.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
My Gaming Week, I'll try to be kind of quick here, because I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
In fact, I spent a lot of time playing some old stuff.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Virtual Console on Wii U, go figure.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
I actually bought a lot of stuff on it, I'm kind of embarrassed to say.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
But Mega Man, the old school Mega Man came out this week, and how could I not?

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
Like, the Mega Man games have some of the best soundtracks.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Yeah, so I had to check it out on Virtual Console, and I'm loving the whole

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
restore points are a godsend in stages like Ice Man's stage.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
That stage can go to hell for those blocks that appear or disappear.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
But yeah, I've been having a good time with that.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
Otherwise, there's another game, but Darkstalker is going to bring it up later in the show.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
So I'll wait to get my comments on that until later.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
Oh, I was on Steam randomly last night, and I was looking at the free-to-play games,

33:57.000 --> 34:03.000
and I was going to do Ragnarok Online 2, but I decided instead to play Puzzle Pirates.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Remember Puzzle Pirates?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
I saw that the other day.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I'm like, that's on Steam?

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Yeah, I know, right?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
That was sweet.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
I was like, God, that took me back.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
That was like, we all played that.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
That's what we used to play when we were all playing DDR regularly.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Like, a ton of us were playing Puzzle Pirates.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
I remember I reamed on a song.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I didn't play it at the time.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
But I think actually during those days, I was playing Ragnarok Online.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
And the building is still the same freaking thing with the match.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
But they've added a lot to it.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Like, you have rooms that you customize.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
It's definitely a game that they put out there for more lower-end PCs.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
You could probably play Puzzle Pirates just fine on a netbook.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
It's that kind of game.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
So yeah, that was kind of fun to just kind of get back into that again.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
Otherwise, World of Warcraft, Mass Effect 3, a lot of the usual suspects.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
And another game that I'm going to be reviewing on VoG soon.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
So stay tuned for that.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Okay.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Quick, plugs for the Twitters, the Facebooks and all that.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R is where you can follow us on Twitter.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
And I don't really have a whole lot else to add.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
We may not be here Memorial Day weekend.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
I may be gone.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
But we'll let you know in the next couple weeks.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
So stay tuned for all that live programming information.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
All right.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Let's talk about the gaming news.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Loki, start us off tonight.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Okay.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
So apparently the Wii U has now been hacked.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Or at least the mod chip creators behind the Wii key.

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
They have now said that they have claimed to, I guess, compromise Wii U security.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
And completely reverse the Wii U drive authentication,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
disk encryption, file system and everything else.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
And yeah.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
And I guess what's supposed to come of this

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
is that they're going to either create a replacement optical drive

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
that will go into your Wii U.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Or they're going to create some sort of...

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
Like I've seen this before with some of the Xbox 360 drives

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
where they'll have a daughter board or something like that

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
that replaces a board on there

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
and you can just kind of hook in the ribbon cables

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
and it's a bypass or something.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
So they'll have something like that.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
And the Wii key...

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Actually the Wii key, I want to say...

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
No, that's not the mod chip I have in my Wii.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
I actually have a Cyclo Wii.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
It was that one.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
But the Wii keys were pretty similar.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
It was just kind of like a...

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
They had a few quick solder points

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
and they just soldered straight onto the board on the disk drive.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
And to kind of show, I guess, how serious that this is,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
they've also dumped their first game,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
One of the probably most terrible games out there.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
But they have dumped it and...

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Well, somebody's dumped it

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
and it's been released out there on the internet

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
to download and do nothing with

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
because there's no such mod chip to play it on yet.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
But yeah, Nintendo is aware of it.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
They say that they're going to find a way to bypass everything.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
But thus begins the back and forth struggle

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
that is hacking and patching,

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
more hacking and more patching, so on and so forth.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
And so far, there's really no homebrew version

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
or homebrew needs of this.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
I guess maybe you can make your own software for the Wii U,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
but this is mainly piracy.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Hackers going to hack.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Or backups, I guess, if you will.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Yeah, sure.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
Okay, so I think the real question to ask here, though,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
is how hard is this to pull off?

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
Because the harder it is, the less impact this is going to have.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
We know that the pirates and the people

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
that are all about wanting to steal games,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
or make backups, as fast as they can,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
they're always going to find a way in.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
But the question is, how easy is it

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
for somebody else to do that?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
This is going to be like a mod chip.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
So you're going to have to buy a mod chip.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
You're going to have to install the mod chip onto your system

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
or install some sort of part on your system.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
This isn't like the Wii homebrew channel

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
where it was a hack that modified your dashboard

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
to run a program that you could then

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
run games off a hard drive.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
It's not that simple. You have to buy a mod chip.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Can Nintendo brick your console

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
with a firmware update if you were running this?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
They may threaten to do that.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I don't know if they can.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
There's drive emulators and stuff like that

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
that are already out there.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Why don't they do it?

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
My point is, why would Nintendo play softball with this?

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
If they want to be like,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
don't fuck with us.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Because of false positives is what it is.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Because if you have someone that legitimately

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
hasn't done anything and fucked their console up,

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
they're already in not a very strong position

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
with their console and to piss people off like that.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
Also, they're probably going to let this thing get released,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
get people to buy the console because they're like,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
oh, I'm going to hack all this stuff up and then patch it.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Okay.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
That's smart.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
That's what I would think they would do.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
How many people went and got a PSP

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
the day they heard that NES emulators are runnable on it?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
On top of that though,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
they're probably going to be prompted

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
if this does come out pretty widespread,

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
they're going to be prompted by their third party developers

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
that hey, we need you to fix this

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
because we're not making a lot off of these Wii games already

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
and if we're making even less now because people are pirating them,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
it's going to be a tough thing.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
And also, here's the other thing you've got to consider too,

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
these aren't necessarily DVDs that they're running on anymore

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
so you're going to have to have a Blu-ray burner

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
and Blu-ray media to do that.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
I think that stuff's come down.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
That stuff's coming way down.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
We're only a couple of years away from that being standard really for PCs.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
But if anything, I could see them go on the route of the X key or something

39:40.000 --> 39:47.000
where it's basically a drive in the middle board

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
that allows you to run.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
It'll emulate the drive and you'll run stuff off a hard drive

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
and it's going to be easy like that.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
The way I see it, they're going to do it.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
But right now, it's progress I guess.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
But if they've completely reversed the file system and stuff,

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
who's to say that they can't come up with their own modified dashboard

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
that will run on there

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
because if they've figured out how to do the file system stuff

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
and then the keys for that.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
The hacking community is going to have an interesting case to make too.

40:14.000 --> 40:20.000
I understand why they wanted to do Homebrew Channel on Wii

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
because there wasn't a lot of indie friendly stuff on the Wii.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
But Wii U is really trying to make a case.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
We are the indie friendly platform.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
You've even heard the indie developers come out and say,

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
I know this is going to shock people,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
but Nintendo is the platform to be on right now if you're indie.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
So does the hacking community have as much of a case

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
when it seems like Nintendo is really embracing a lot of the Homebrew stuff open arms?

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Well, I shouldn't say Homebrew, but indie stuff open arms,

40:47.000 --> 40:58.000
thus negating the need for a Homebrew channel that is totally clean without piracy.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I don't think that they're really going to...

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
It's just one hacking group doing something and that's it.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
So you're going to have people that want to...

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
They're in the business of selling mod chips,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
so they're going to want to make a mod chip to sell.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
And we use just the console at the moment.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
As soon as PlayStation 4 is out, they'll be working on that too.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Of course, yeah.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
All right, well, Loki alluded to this a minute ago,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
and I was mentioning this earlier in the show

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
when they were teasing me about the Wii message light being on,

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
but Nintendo actually sent a message to all the Wii owners this week saying,

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
hey, have you checked out the Wii U?

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
So it seems odd to me that it took them this long to do it,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
but they did send a message to everybody that says,

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
quote, did you know that you can play nearly all of your existing Wii games on Wii U?

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
I thought you could play every Wii game on Wii U.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Why did they say nearly all?

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
I think they're counting maybe virtual console and stuff.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
Is there some stuff that you can't quite port over?

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
Maybe it's something to save their ass if something doesn't work.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Yeah, it's possible.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Maybe, yeah, that's true.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
Your Wii controllers and many Wii accessories can also be used with the new Wii U console,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
along with any downloaded games, save data,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
and other info stored in your existing Wii console.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Wii U is the all-new home console from Nintendo.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
It's not just an upgrade.

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
It's an entirely new system that will change the way you and your family experience games and entertainment.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Do you hear that, Jimmy Fallon? It's not just an upgrade.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
That's a big problem, though.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
I mean, think about it.

42:23.000 --> 42:30.000
If they have to go out there and tell people, hey, guys, it's not just a peripheral, it's an upgrade,

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
they've done a poor job marketing it then.

42:33.000 --> 42:39.000
Well, that and maybe this is a case now where the name issue is finally biting Nintendo.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
A lot of people razz them for the Wii name, and that ended up working.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
It didn't matter. Nintendo did great with that.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
But this whole Wii U name, I think maybe Nintendo's wondering,

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
I don't know if they are, but I think a lot of people are going, maybe that really wasn't the best name.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
They should have started off calling it the U.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
Or, well, Super Wii, which is, isn't that what they call it in Japan?

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Something that translates to Super Wii?

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Something like that?

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Yeah, Koopa Kid Jeremy in our chat right there says,

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
this just proves they should have called it something else.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
Mm-hmm. Agree.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
Anyhow, what I think is interesting about this also,

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
Iwata, Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata, said in a financial results briefing last week that,

43:24.000 --> 43:30.000
quote, we have not been able to solidly communicate the product value of Wii U to our consumers yet,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
which has been a grand challenge for us.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
We have the misunderstanding that Wii U is just Wii with a pad for games,

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
and others even consider Wii U GamePad as a peripheral device connectable to Wii.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
Wii feel deeply responsible for not having tried hard enough to have consumers understand the product.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
Have they done the commercial onslaught that they did with Wii?

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Like, I remember all those commercials, Wii would like to play, and that whole thing.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
That was a pretty good marketing plan. Now they have, like,

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Did they do that at all?

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
They have a new marketing campaign going on right now that's really dumb.

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
It's basically these families coming in, and they're, like, bussing them in by, or,

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
vanning them in, whatever, taking them by a van,

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
and bringing them to Nintendo headquarters to try the Wii U out for the first time,

44:12.000 --> 44:18.000
and they're like, Oh my God! Nintendo stuff is so awesome! This is the best thing ever!

44:18.000 --> 44:23.000
Oh, this GamePad is so amazing! This is gonna change it all!

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
And it's just, like, seriously, just one issue.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
If Nintendo really wants to get their message across about the Wii U, here's what they need to do.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
They're gonna need to release a Mario soccer game this Christmas,

44:34.000 --> 44:40.000
and they need to take it out across America to all the little peewee soccer championships,

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
so all their target audience, the moms and dads of the soccer kids, can play Mario soccer,

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
and then they can all gossip amongst themselves and get the word out.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
Like, that's how Nintendo reaches their core audience, right? Soccer games.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Eh?

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Bowling!

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
They are at malls.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
The problem is you have people that were really excited about the Wii, you know, like myself,

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
and bought it because it was a very innovative product at the time.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
Granted, we wish it was kind of like, you know, graphics of the Xbox 360 and PS3.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I was in it for the donuts.

45:11.000 --> 45:17.000
And so you bought it, and then you're like, Hmm. I'm not playing anything on it.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
I bought these Mario games. Now I'm not really playing anything on it.

45:21.000 --> 45:26.000
And then the new system comes out, and you're like, Well, okay. It's got this cool game pad on it.

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
Okay, but hold on, though, because there would be that one or two games a year that are like,

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
you know, Metroid Prime 3, Mario Galaxy, Zelda Skyward Sword.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
You know, there are those big, big games that are like, Okay, I gotta play some.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
First party games?

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Yes.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
A game's a game in this case, yes.

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
Yeah, it's fantastic, and then when, you know, the developers are so behind, you know, the Wii and stuff,

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
in fact, they thought it was so great that they decided, Hey, EA said, Hey, you know what?

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
We're gonna put out FIFA on this system every year.

45:56.000 --> 46:01.000
Oh, it's not gonna be a different FIFA, but it'll be the same FIFA every year.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Because, you know, we don't want to put any money into it.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
That's different. That's different. You can't blame Nintendo for what EA did.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
Okay. Konami decided, Hey, you know what? We're gonna do Pro-E.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
You can't blame them for that either.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
What is it with soccer games? I mean, seriously.

46:13.000 --> 46:22.000
That would be like me blaming Microsoft for all those terrible rehashes in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
That wasn't Microsoft's fault.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Can't blame them for all the shovelware on the Wii?

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
No, no.

46:26.000 --> 46:35.000
I just think there wasn't, the Wii U, the step from the Wii, or like, you know, previous generation, the GameCube to the Wii,

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
there was a big jump as far as gameplay, innovation, stuff like that.

46:39.000 --> 46:46.000
When you have the Wii U, where the only thing really different with it is, it has a gamepad now that you can use with a touchscreen,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
and it's HD.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
But it plays all the, you know, it does everything else that the Wii does.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
It wasn't that kind of a wow factor to it.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
I mean, you had like something good and then, everyone's not gonna be clamoring to get it because they're like,

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
Well, I can play Wii Bowling on this, right? Okay.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
Well, why do I need to buy a new system to play the same game I'm already playing?

47:09.000 --> 47:15.000
Or, you know, hey, cool that they're gonna have a new Mario game, but it kinda looks like the other Mario game that I bought a couple years ago.

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
So, the short version of what you just said I'm hearing is, Nintendo Land was not Wii Sports.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
Nintendo Land wasn't Wii Sports, and I don't think it was, it was a system seller.

47:24.000 --> 47:29.000
A big, big chunk of people, I feel like we, this is a very deja vu conversation, so we need to move on here a minute.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
It was like Wii Sports, Nintendo version or something.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
How many people that bought the Wii were not buying the Wii?

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
They were not buying the Wii, they were buying Wii Sports and the console that came with it.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
That was a big chunk of people that bought the Wii.

47:41.000 --> 47:49.000
Yeah, because it was kinda cool, because for the first time, you're gonna be able to like play tennis by like actually standing up in the room and swinging your arms.

47:49.000 --> 47:58.000
And that was a big experience for people. It was like, whoa, you know, for once, I can actually play a game, I don't need to figure out the controls, I just play like I would kinda play tennis.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
And, you know, I would bowl like I would bowl. You know, it was very natural for people.

48:03.000 --> 48:08.000
But then, going to Nintendo Land, it's like, well, it's not that different.

48:08.000 --> 48:15.000
Well, this is kinda similar to what I've already done on the Wii, but why do I need to spend the extra money to play this game that's very similar to what I already have?

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
That was the problem, it wasn't just, it wasn't a big hook that got people in.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
That gamepad was not enough hook to get people onto the system.

48:23.000 --> 48:29.000
Maybe if they'd put out a game, like, you know, the thing about Wii Sports is that everybody generally knows those sports. Everybody knows bowling.

48:29.000 --> 48:38.000
Specifically within Wii Sports, that bowling mini-game, maybe the tennis to an extent too, but those two games specifically were just huge.

48:38.000 --> 48:48.000
And maybe Nintendo Wii U needed something, it needed that for, or still needs, it could still come out this Christmas, needs something like that that everybody just knows.

48:49.000 --> 48:56.000
You know bowling, you know, but you don't necessarily know Donkey Kong Crash Course or F-Zero, you don't necessarily know that stuff.

48:56.000 --> 49:06.000
I don't know why, but my mind goes to like maybe a board game or a card game thing, especially if you could like play it online or something, but that would require Nintendo to understand online.

49:06.000 --> 49:13.000
The problem is, for the Wii U, I think what they would have needed to have done is like done something completely different than the Wii.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
Like, I don't know, come up with, I can't really think of what they would have to do.

49:17.000 --> 49:25.000
Here you go, Tiger Claw says, too bad Wii Sports didn't have online multiplayer, sucks playing by yourself against the computer. Kabam, Wii Sports 2, online.

49:25.000 --> 49:31.000
But the thing with the Wii, what they're pushing though, is that it's a family party atmosphere is what it is.

49:31.000 --> 49:38.000
But that's not the dynamic anymore. That used to be the dynamic when it was like, you know, offline games that had four controller ports.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
Like the GameCube was, you know, you got people in the room and you're playing together on TV split screen.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
That's not how it is anymore. It's over the internet playing multiplayer because people don't live near each other.

49:47.000 --> 49:56.000
You now have friends. Instead of having friends in your neighborhood and maybe a pen pal or something in another state, you have friends all over the world because everyone's so connected now.

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
That's true. I probably do more gaming with Shane in Kansas than anybody else.

50:01.000 --> 50:10.000
Exactly. Like distance isn't a thing anymore, really. I mean, you talk to people, you probably talk to people more that are like further away than you do like your neighbors and stuff.

50:10.000 --> 50:18.000
So it's not the thing. And that's the thing. Like I don't, like the Wii, you know, it was kind of fun playing the Wii stuff, but it was all party game stuff.

50:18.000 --> 50:24.000
And I can't see myself getting the Wii U because, hey, now five people could play. Cool. I don't have five people in my house ever.

50:24.000 --> 50:33.000
Okay. YYR with a valid counter statement in our chat room at live.vognetware.com. The audience for Wii Sports probably didn't care that much about online play.

50:33.000 --> 50:40.000
True. But hear me out here a minute, YYR, because you have that camera on every Wii U console.

50:40.000 --> 50:48.000
What if grandma could play bowling with her grandkids thanks to the internet technology in that case, like every Wii U could have...

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
It would be awesome.

50:49.000 --> 50:56.000
That would be amazing. But Nintendo, like Nintendo's sitting on that gold mine and they, that's not what they want to do for some reason.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
Because that's all they were showing is like, hey, but you could do FaceTime back and forth and talk to grandma.

51:00.000 --> 51:09.000
Make grandma understand why she wants to play online. Maybe if grandma understood why that would be a great thing, that's not such an issue anymore.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
But I respect your point, YYR. I get what you're saying.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
I understand.

51:13.000 --> 51:19.000
Yeah, I totally do too. I just think Nintendo could invent a reason why you want to be online. Anyhow.

51:19.000 --> 51:31.000
Part of me also thinks though that I've had this view of Nintendo as sort of the traditionalist and how social should be.

51:31.000 --> 51:39.000
And the fact that they actually want to get people together in the same room doing in-person gaming.

51:39.000 --> 51:48.000
I mean, it almost seems to me that they've got an agenda to encourage that. And I don't know. I don't see them changing off of that anytime really soon.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
I got to go back to like real quick, you know, because that does make sense that that may be their agenda.

51:53.000 --> 52:02.000
But then you got to go to the movie Joe Dirt where there's the guy with, you know, the fireworks stand and all he has is sparklers and those little snakes.

52:02.000 --> 52:10.000
And he's like, but that's what I like. But you can't just think about what you like or what your focus may be. You have to think about other people out there.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
I understand that may be the focus that you want people to gain in the room, but you know what would be awesome too?

52:15.000 --> 52:22.000
Is say you want to have that gaming experience, but you can't get your friends over. You know, say that, you know, they're gone somewhere and you want to play with them anyways.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Think about all the options.

52:24.000 --> 52:32.000
Koopa kid Jeremy in our chat room says, keep grandma off the internet. Old people opening 90 tabs, all of them yahoo.com.

52:32.000 --> 52:38.000
Oh, you know, why did your friend Billy send me this link? What is what is two girls, one cup? What is this?

52:38.000 --> 52:45.000
You know, it's actually hilarious. Dan's grandmother is super into the internet. She does her genealogy.

52:46.000 --> 52:58.000
Oh, that's my dad. That's my dad. She's probably one of the most computer literate people in her age group that did not start off in programming or engineering that I know.

52:58.000 --> 53:06.000
And it's pretty neat to watch her. However, my maternal grandmother, she will like poke around a little bit and maybe look at Facebook and then that's it.

53:06.000 --> 53:12.000
My granny's like, no, those things. I don't want to look at them. Your daddy's going to mess with that. Not me.

53:12.000 --> 53:26.000
Whereas my mother is all about Twitter. She doesn't post on it. I told I told her, Mom, if you would use Twitter, I could give out your name and you would have so many followers because your tweets would be like you need to tweet about American Idol and shit and things that get you really angry.

53:26.000 --> 53:34.000
But she just she loves to read it. She'll tell me about, you know, what Kathy Griffin and Cher posting on Twitter and and all the people that she follows.

53:34.000 --> 53:39.000
It's like that's the Internet. I love Kathy Griffin and Cher and Anderson Cooper.

53:40.000 --> 53:47.000
They all need to do a buddy comedy. All right. We have distanced ourselves way away from the original topic, which means next topic, Dark Sakura.

53:47.000 --> 53:55.000
Oh, yes. My turn, isn't it? God damn it, Rob. Making me work. Well, there's a little game called Fire Emblem.

53:55.000 --> 54:05.000
And this is actually for Fire Emblem Awakening Summer Scramble is the new DLC. It's out in North America and Europe.

54:05.000 --> 54:15.000
But they have censored a scene. There is a character named Tharja who I guess she's like pulling out her underwear or something or pulling it up.

54:15.000 --> 54:28.000
But the edit that they made to it makes it even worse because there's like a piece of cloth now, like a curtain or something that's flowed in between where her butt is.

54:28.000 --> 54:35.000
And so all you see is like if you weren't looking for the little strap on the side, it would look like she's got her hands in her ass.

54:35.000 --> 54:42.000
Like she's digging her fingers and she's self muppeting. It's I like that.

54:42.000 --> 54:48.000
I'm going to have to work in the more conversations. Is that an urban dictionary? That should be, though.

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
But like, it's just the OK.

54:53.000 --> 54:59.000
And this is my big thing about censorship, is that the only reason the shit's a big deal is because you make it a fucking big deal.

54:59.000 --> 55:07.000
You know, it's like the approach I take, I take to quote foul language around kids.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
You know, if you're not supposed to say the words, that's just going to make it all the more attractive to say it.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
You know, if you'd act like it's not a big deal to them, it's not a big deal.

55:16.000 --> 55:22.000
Same goes with, you know, censorship of, you know, a woman pulling up her underwear.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
The way that they edit. It's a bathing suit.

55:27.000 --> 55:37.000
What they did to this, it just makes it look even worse because it went, you know, when you give somebody a clear, concrete picture, it leaves a little room to the imagination.

55:37.000 --> 55:47.000
Like black bars. Exactly. We did this in college is that we were making a music video and we had the guy stand out in just a pair of like gym shorts.

55:47.000 --> 55:52.000
But when we did the movie, we put a black bar over it because it was supposed to be the girls.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
Why am I talking about this on the show? We did like a Spice Girls music video for a college project.

55:56.000 --> 56:01.000
And at the end of the video, the girls talking, shut up. The girls steal his clothes.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
And so at the end, he's just standing there with a black bar over it. Well, he didn't get naked for us.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
He was wearing gym shorts and we put the black bar over it and it looked like he was naked.

56:09.000 --> 56:14.000
It's an illusion. And your pervy little minds don't think, oh, he's wearing gym shorts.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
They think, oh, well, it's like you had to block his penis.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
Well, it's like you can also, here's a good example of the Austin Powers movie.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
The first one. Oh, God. Yes. With the cantaloupe. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:26.000 --> 56:33.000
She had like red pasties over the jumblies to steal Mystique's word.

56:33.000 --> 56:41.000
But I mean, when you take away the concrete image and you put just something in front of it,

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
it's going to leave a lot more to the imagination.

56:44.000 --> 56:55.000
And in the end, I think it's going to, you know, probably be more unintentionally explicit,

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
because the brain, if it can be porned, the brain will porn it.

57:01.000 --> 57:06.000
And too, since I worked in a classy reference to Joe Dirt in the last topic,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I'm going to reference Bioshock Infinite in this one.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
The mind of the subject will desperately struggle to create memories where none exists.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
In other words, they will undress the bitch when they can't see her clothes.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
And also think of the children. Think of the children.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
How many children are playing Fire Emblem? How many children can understand Fire Emblem?

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
It's a 3DS game. All of the children are playing Fire Emblem.

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
I guess I say that and then I'm like, oh, wait a minute, Rob, when you were 10,

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
you were totally playing Final Fantasy. So I guess.

57:37.000 --> 57:42.000
Here's another fun example, because Prince Brightstar mentioned the black bars in Japan.

57:42.000 --> 57:50.000
Remember when we got Final Fuck X and it was all squared out, the pixelated?

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I was like, we know that's badge.

57:52.000 --> 57:58.000
OK, we need to switch topic stat, Loki.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
For the record, that was entirely hilarious.

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
It was just cosplay porn. I mean, there wasn't even any male characters that were dressed up like Final Fantasy characters.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
It was really good cosplay, though.

58:09.000 --> 58:16.000
Fine. Anyway, so there was a game that came out called Scribblenauts Unlimited,

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
and they keep adding stuff each year. Well, this year they added some mames.

58:21.000 --> 58:29.000
And to go along with that, Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat were some of the characters featured in the game.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
And guess what? They're copyrighted.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
But apparently Fissel or Warner Brothers didn't really give a shit,

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
or just were blatantly unaware that things get copyrighted on the Internet and that kind of stuff.

58:39.000 --> 58:47.000
So, yeah, apparently the creators of those two properties are a little pissed off,

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
and they have filed a lawsuit.

58:49.000 --> 58:56.000
Because, apparently, neither Fissel or Warner Brothers were even acknowledging it.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Just kind of like, eh.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
And, you know, they-

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
It's just some Internet kids.

59:02.000 --> 59:13.000
And, you know, they do support the fact that people make things on the Internet for non-profit stuff, and that's fine.

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
But this is clearly for-profit. It was something that they advertised to the game, saying,

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
hey, look, Nyan Cat's in there, and Keyboard Cat, you should buy this game.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
And people were like, oh, cool, I'm gonna buy the game because of that.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
So, yeah.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
Well, just like the Nintendo version had Mario and Luigi in it, and they had to work out that deal with Nintendo.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
That's why they're not in the PC version, right?

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Mm-hmm.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
It's very similar.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I kind of think a lot of this is ignorance.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
I kind of think- I don't think the developers meant to do this maliciously.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
No, I don't think that's malicious.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
I don't- I think they just thought, oh, Nyan Cat's like this 4chan thing, nobody really owns it, so let's just, you know, lift it.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
It'll be funny for our game.

59:47.000 --> 59:55.000
But, now that WB, the parent company, is not returning these guys' phone calls, who, yeah, it is a trademark thing or whatever,

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
now they're pissed off, and this is their warning shot to get noticed.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It'll get settled out of court, as these things always do.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But, uh, very interesting.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
The precedent for the meme stuff is very interesting.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And how this could affect future Scrimble lot games.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I don't think the keyboard cat thing is as- like, the Nyan Cat, yeah, that one's gonna be pretty hard to defend,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
because that looks just like the little kitty.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
But the keyboard cat is just a cat sitting at the piano.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
It doesn't have that song, I don't even think the colors are right.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I don't- and keyboard cat's a little trickier.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I kind of think that's just thrown in for good measure.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I don't know if that has quite the legal-

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
They also have, like, long cat and stuff, I think, are in the game, and-

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
But I don't think anybody owns long cat.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
No, I don't think so.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Yeah.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Um, now I wanna know if, um, My Body is Ready is in there.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And then what that does-

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Uh, My Body is Ready is not a noun, though, so...

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And, um...

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Did I say a noun? I think I did.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Noun.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
But, I mean, there- I- I think that, though, um,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I know that there are a number of memes out there that are, um, under copyright.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And I think that they're well- well within their right to pursue action.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Sure.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And especially, um, I really- and this is maybe just a- a guilty pleasure.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I love seeing the big companies taken down a notch.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Yeah.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I mean, there's a lot of people quick to defend Scribblenauts and stuff,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
and it's not- it's not that I'm, like, anti-Scribblenauts or I wanna see Scribblenauts.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
No, I love Scribblenauts. It's a cute game and so forth.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
But, okay, I also like the internet culture and a lot of what the internet brings up.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It actually- some of these meme things, I really like to see how it turns around some people's lives.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Like, think about that chick, the, um, ain't nobody got time for that when she was on the local news.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
She's got, like, commercial deals now.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Or Antoine.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Like, things- that guy, there was a really interesting development with him this week.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
But, yeah, I mean, for all practical purposes, he's, you know, did a lot with his stuff, too.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
The whole, they're clamming in your windows, they're snatching people up.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
You know, they milk their fifteen minutes of fame.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And it ends up being a happy ending of sorts.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Actually, I think that Queen Semia in chat is right.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Keyboard Cat is copyrighted or trademarked.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Yes.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Because, well, the guy, actually, I remember watching an interview where he licensed out his cat's likeness for the pistachio commercial.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Right. But the cat in Scribblenauts doesn't really look like it like Nyan Cat does.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
It can be considered enough derivative, but I think copyright law is, what, fifty percent change?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Yeah, I think, I think that would be the harder one to prove.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Well, and also the fact that you sum it by typing Keyboard Cat.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You know, that's true. Or Nyan Cat.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
But one could argue, well, it is a cat at the keyboard. I don't know.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
It is a cat that's Nyan.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I still want my body is ready to be in there.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
That's not a noun. Reggie Fils-Aime could be in there in the Nintendo version.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I bet if you type that in, the only thing that happens is his jaw comes out.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
The game just punches you in the face. That's what happens.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Or starts printing money.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, 4chan the game. Ain't nobody got time for that.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I thought that's what Scribblenauts kind of like was, was its big selling point. Was that it had all these memes in it.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Oh, those stupid guys that were sitting behind us at the baseball game. They're like, foul ball. Ain't nobody got time for that.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I about laughed my ass off, but I was, I was actually thinking of you doing your impression.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Honey Brown. What's her name? Honey Brown or whatever her name is. She'd go sue those guys.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Yeah. All right.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And yes, you get ceiling cat.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Yes, ceiling cat's there.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The ceiling cat isn't trademarked.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Grumpy cat. I bet is.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Grumpy cat is.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
So he better not show up in the next Scribblenauts.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
We all loved Tard.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
All right. I'm sure a lot of you guys heard about this next story. It was making the rounds everywhere. It's, it's kind of lolsy.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
It's about the game Game Dev Tycoon. No relation to the game dev story.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:53.000
But Game Dev Tycoon came out this past week on Windows, Macs and Linux and Green Heart Games, the folks behind it.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
And they did this interesting thing to kind of combat piracy, which I guess was some type of experiment or whatever.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:07.000
And what they did is they put up a copy of the game on one of the big torrent sites and with a little info file that you'd see with most cracked games.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
That says, you know, fully cracked, playable, dah, dah, dah.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:20.000
But in an old throwback to, let's say, the Earthbound pirate copies of many years ago, it would change the game significantly to make it unbeatable.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
How does it change the game?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Well, at some point, piracy starts taking over your game development office.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You'll get a little message that pops up on the screen that says,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Boss, it seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
If players don't buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
You have to click on a little frown to continue. You can't beat the game at this point.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And of course it has all these people posting on internet forums about it.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Like, how do I get the piracy to stop in the game? Which is just giving away how many people were pirating it.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Very similar as well to, didn't they do this with Arkham Asylum? Not City, but Asylum.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
They had, like, a whole thing where Batman couldn't make a certain jump.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
And people were posting on forums about this, and WB just went ban, ban, ban, ban.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Because these were all the people, yeah, that were pirating it.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Anyway, this guy was collecting anonymous usage statistics and found that it was, what, over 90% of the copies of this being played were pirated.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Crazy.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:31.000
But, were those people going to actually play the game legitimately in the first place, or did they just find it when they were browsing new games that are added to the Pirate Bay?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Because he put it out there himself, you know, on the Pirate Bay, and people were downloading it.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And let's not forget that other indie companies have put out their game on the Pirate Bay to drive up interest in the game and to, you know, get people to test the game out.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:03.000
So, that's my thing is, I wonder, I'm not saying that someone confused that for this, I'm sure that people are just pirating, but you can't attribute, if you didn't do that, would your game really be pirated that fast?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And would it, you still have the same, you know, statistics, I guess. That's my thing.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
So, if anything, the whole reason behind this is now, it's just for the controversy.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Because, now it got picked up by all these websites, and now all these people are writing stories about it.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Well, okay.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And now he has a legit version out there, and now everyone's like, oh, we gotta support the indies, let's go buy this game, even though, you know, you may or may not want to play it.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Well, either way, okay, either way you slice this pie low-key, whether you want to say it was the piracy mechanism or the exposure, genius, genius move.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000
No matter which way you slice it, whatever angle they were, either it was a genius anti-piracy scheme or it was a genius marketing scheme.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000
But it's not very, it's not very honest in the fact that, you know, basically they're, it's kind of like, I would say, like entrapment almost.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:56.000
The irony of you saying entrapping pirates is not very honest. The irony, it hurts, it's burning.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Well, there's a-

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I need ice cubes.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I feel less, I feel less sorry about a company that puts their game up there by themselves versus a game getting leaked to the internet.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
What were you gonna say, Jamie? Sorry, I had to make my point.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Breakman was saying using Pirate Bay as your game testers.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
It does end up being kind of like a demo of sorts.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I mean, cool, you know, cool that people are checking out their game.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I'm sure that's what they want in the end and hopefully it works out for them.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Yeah.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I personally am not going to pick up this game. It may have been, you know, the fact that it's compared to Game Dev Story, it's a little similar to that.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Might be intriguing, but after what they did, fuck them. I'm not buying it. I'm not playing it either.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
So you are personally offended by this little move?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I just think it's shady. It's so shady. There's, like, there's a difference between, like, putting-

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
But the Pirate Bay is shady!

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:03.000
No, no, no, hold on. There's a difference between putting something in your game, you know, like Scribbl- not Scribblats, but like the Michael Jackson game on 3DS, or on DS, or-

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Oh, the Vuvuzela thing. Somebody just brought that up in chat.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Or, like, the Batman stuff, programming a little thing in there to catch pirates when the game gets leaked out.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Okay, that's something. That's kind of cool that they've got that in there and you can catch people doing it.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But the fact that you go, oh, we're gonna show these pirates, we're gonna upload a real co- I mean, come on, that's stupid.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:29.000
It's like saying, oh, I'm gonna open up my house and I'm gonna say, hey, come steal my shit, and then get pissed off that people are stealing my shit.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I'm sorry, that's just stupid. It's stupid. And you think you're gonna teach these people moral?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It's one of those things, like, to say that this is gonna work in the game, people will buy your game, it's just like those stupid advertisements before they-

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Think about the lighting rig, people! They're out of jobs because you pirate your movies!

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I'm sorry, it's just stupid.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Okay, let's say we're about ready to put out a CD of exclusive Orange Lounge Radio material and things that, you know, never before heard on the show,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
and that's how we're gonna pay for our hosting for the next year. Hypothetical situation.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:10.000
How do I make sure that that CD does not get pirated without possibly offending the pirates out there in the world?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000
You can't. It's music, you're not gonna be able to. There's no DRM that you can put on that.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:25.000
So, bend over and take it. And enjoy it. Put it out there for free yourself and just hope they'll rally behind you because you're one of them.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Most likely, here's the thing, the situation with that is, you're not gonna have a whole lot of interest of people putting it up.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:39.000
They're not gonna leak it out there because they just don't- they figure that, you know, if there's no interest in trying to get the game,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
they're not gonna necessarily put it out there or, you know, the content.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:51.000
So, for example, I can't find copies of maybe somebody VHS, you know, recording episodes of Being Bobby Brown.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:00.000
That's just not on the internet at all. My wife is wanting me to search high and low and I will till, you know, the day I die to find copies of that.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
But it's just not up there.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
For Being Bobby Brown, I will endorse piracy because everybody has to see that, Bobby!

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000
It's fantastic but, you know, Whitney was a bitch and she fucking took all- you know, had her lawyers take all that shit down.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Babe in total control of herself.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Exactly. And she, you know, had everybody, you know, take, you know, the copies off the internet.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Not necessarily, just like a lot of the clips too are just gone.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000
So, unfortunately, you know, there's that but I just don't think anyone would pirate our CD.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I mean, sure, they could leak it out there but is anyone really gonna care to download it?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Okay. So when it comes to- maybe my example about music was a bad one.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.000
But when it comes to games, you had Tim here on the show last night whose job is in the industry making games like Tomb Raider.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:54.000
What is an effective DRM strategy that we can do to make sure that as many games as possible sell legitimately so people like Tim can continue to be employed?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Free to play. Because you basically-

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Everything's gotta go free to play.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Everything's gotta go free to play.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:08.000
And I'm not saying free to play to the point of, you know, it doesn't even have to necessarily be free to play, like cheap to play I guess.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
You know, like $10 games with a ton of DLC.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000
DLC that makes sense, not just, oh you're out of energy points, you gotta buy some DLC to be able to play this game longer.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Not anything retarded like that but actually supported DLC.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I mean, granted the game might be shorter because it's more of a demo but that's- what I'm saying is basically you get a small amount of content.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
For example, Ridge Racer for the Vita would have worked perfectly like that except they charged $40 for it.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Or $30 for four tracks. It's ridiculous.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
If they put it out for like five bucks or ten- probably like five bucks would be perfect.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Okay, Bobby's retort in chat, it's a fair one, I gotta put it out there. This was an $8 game and it was still pirated.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
It's still a game.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:56.000
But yeah, I understand that. It may be an $8 game but once again, they put it out there first, they put it out there.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Would an $8 game-

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Shots fired!

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Would an $8 game be leaked that quickly?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
That's the question. How quickly would an $8 indie game be leaked out to the internet?

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
There's people who leak games just because they can.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I understand that they can leak games but if there's DRM on, I mean, I'm assuming it's DRM free but let's assume that there was DRM on it.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Would really someone spend the time to crack this game and put it out there?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I mean, sure, there's probably somebody out there that would do it.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
But I don't know if it's gonna have as big of a draw once now it's all controversial.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I would actually agree with you to an extent that we have to find a way to get the price of games down.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And I realize cartridges used to cost 70 bucks and the price we're paying for games now is actually cheaper than they used to be with inflation.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
But with everything else going on in the world, I honestly think we have to find a way to get the price of games down to like 30 or 40 bucks.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Because when do people these days buy most of their PC games?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Steam, sales, when everything gets super cheap, you know?

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I love Steam so much.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I think that's the thing and you gotta find that balance between how much do I charge for it and make sure enough people buy it so that I recoup my costs.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
But Steam's also a double-edged sword too because now there's games that come out on PC.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I might think of buying Bioshock Infinite on PC as well as on 360.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Because I already have the 360 version but I may buy it on PC.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
But am I gonna pay full price for it? Fuck no!

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I'm gonna wait for a sale because they have sales all the damn time on Steam, on Amazon, on Green Man Gaming, on Gamefly with Steam DRM, on wherever.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
You're gonna find these games marked down to like nothing.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And that's the kind of mentality.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I mean, lookit, Tomb Raider is just half-priced.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
That game out like two months ago? A month ago?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I mean, shit, you can't do this with console games.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
They're not dropping that fast.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
They're not gonna be five bucks one day and then the next day...

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Well, some do.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Well, some do, but I'm talking about Tomb Raider, a game that sold quite a bit.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And it's totally not a disappointment to anybody.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Gameguru in chat says,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Well, I believe DRM is rather stupid. What the game dev tycoon guys did was actually pretty clever.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Breakman says,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Dev equal, I'll give you $20 to go buy this $10 game. Loki equal, fuck that. Then I'll have to go out of my way. I'm just gonna pirate it.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I don't pirate games anymore.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I mean, I don't pirate games to play them early and then buy the game.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
But you don't pirate them any less?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Yes, I don't pirate them any less.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
No, I don't pirate PC games anymore, for sure.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Maybe to play them a little early, yes, but I do buy them always.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
But never to just play them because I don't want...

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Because it's so easy now with Steam. It's like a few bucks and you got a game.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
It becomes too convenient.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Piracy versus convenience. Is piracy more convenient? No.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000
But if a game gets leaked out that's supposed to be out in a couple months and I can play it way early,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I'm all about playing games as soon as I can.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
If Grand Theft Auto 5 gets leaked out tomorrow, you better believe I'm gonna find a way to get it.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
But you better believe I'm gonna be buying it when it comes out.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I do believe developers, if they really want to protect their property, need to figure...

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
A. Global releases for everything because that's just the world we live in.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And B. You need to cut down this window or figure out a way.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000
If these review copies that go out, I think review copies ought to have the DRM in them and the stringent stuff.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
What's the deal? They're free to the people.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000
We need to make sure that these review copies don't get out into the wild because that's what ruins all the day one sales.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
That's the gap they've got to close.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.000
It's not even really review copies because of the whole Far Cry 3, Blood Dragon, or whatever.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
That was a hack on Uplay.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
But there are some other stuff that gets leaked out from duplicators or games.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000
They go to retail early because they street date stuff and they get shipped to the retailer a week early.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
So then that gets leaked out by some employee.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:19.000
But then there's like the Microsoft games that come out a month ahead time and I'm assuming that's duplicators because I can't see how the hell it could leak any earlier than that.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Alright, I'm sure we'll get some emails on this at a later date.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
OrangeOnsRadio, excuse me, mailbag at OrangeOnsRadio.com.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I do actually want to say there's been a couple cases where I've downloaded PC games through a torrent site because the servers were down for the actual site.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And I had a key to play it. Just saying.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Sometimes, especially if you play Ragnarok online, sometimes it's the only way to get it.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Alright, let's move on with more news. We're running long, so DarkSakura.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Alright, let me get it.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Now, there is, for people who are fans of Eternal Darkness, there is a spiritual successor called Shadow of the Eternals that's been announced.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:13.000
In fact, there's already a bunch of information out on it saying that it's going to be out on PC and Wii U and that they are trying to score 1.5 million to fund the game.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I'm sure it's going to be interesting. What I'm not seeing is if it's a Kickstarter or not out yet for that.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:33.000
But they are wanting to have this, do it episodic and have it out by Q3 2014.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Cool.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Some people I know on Twitter are not big fans of this idea. I mean, as much as Eternal Darkness was awesome, apparently the guy who made it, Dennis Dyack, hasn't made a lot of winners.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
So they're not sure if this is something worth supporting. But he'll get the money.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Well, it looks like it's going to be produced through Precursor Games. So, Canadian group. Good games are coming out of Canada.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming a little bit sooner than things that are getting Kickstarted right now.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Loki, start us off with US.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
There's nothing coming up this week. Seriously, nothing.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Really? Nothing. Not a damn thing?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Nothing until the 14th and 14th would be Metro 20, not 23, Metro Last Light on the 14th.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Why is that? Is that just because it's a slow time of year? They figure everybody is seeing Iron Man.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:40.000
It's a slow time of the year, usually. There's still quite a few releases coming out, but I think we're getting that pre-console launch lull.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And so we don't have a lot of games coming out. There was supposed to be the Wii U version of Deus Ex Human Revolution, but that is now TVA.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:57.000
So, no idea what's going on there. They've delayed it or if they're canceling development on it or what.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Very interesting. Well, going over to Japan and looking at the releases there, guess what? There is nothing coming out in Japan either.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Actually, one game. One game on the Sony PSP. PSP game still selling. Kudwafter, Converted Edition. I think we talked about this last week.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Kudwafter!

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Yeah, we had nothing last week either, so I think we already talked about this game, but it's a very, very slow period in Japan right now.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
But Dark Sakura, you were talking a little bit earlier about the whole holidays in Japan and Gold Week.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Golden Week was this past week and Children's Week is this week.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
So this is likely having an impact on all these releases.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Well, I mean, Golden Week is actually, from what I understand, kind of hard to sell anything because nobody's there.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Golden Week is when you go home to visit your family, so this week would be, I think, a lot busier for sales.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

01:19:46.000 --> 01:20:02.000
We have a very few things in the UK. On the 9th, we have Sid Meier's Ace Patrol and the 10th Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut for Wii U and Persona 4 The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So I'm sure our buddy Magi is very happy about that, as he told me earlier that he was happy.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Because he said after he wrote us that letter that he found out it was coming out.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Nice.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And the new Shin Megami Tensei.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Very cool.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Apparently there's another lawsuit going on now against EA for their Madden franchise.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Apparently this was from a guy named Robin Antonic and he was the designer of John Madden Football for 8-bit computers.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And it's actually going to trial.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And apparently, I guess, he's seeking cuts from all of the games sold so far because they've used a lot of the design that was in his game.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And they've just failed to compensate him or even credit him. In fact, actually...

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Madden 25 out this year, right? 25 years. 25 sequels to Madden.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Yes. And they've actually, I mean, there was on one of the boxes credits him for the Madden games.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:18.000
And now it's just, you know, nothing. No sort of royalties or anything. Even though he was a co-creator of the series.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I don't know. It sounds like he has a pretty strong case. It'll be interesting to see if he can settle out of court or not.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Of course it will. They always...

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
It says it's going to trial, so we never know.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Just because it goes to trial. First day of the trial. Oh, he reached an agreement. Go figure.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:39.000
That happened to me once when I was on jury duty. We were sitting in the little hallway waiting to go in the room.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I didn't even know what the case was about. I didn't know if it was criminal, civil, what.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
We're sitting in the hallway waiting to go in the room and then we're sitting there for like an hour, an hour and a half.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000
They come out and say, oh, they just settled, so we're going to have you guys all go back to the jury room.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Yeah, I've had that happen before today.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Like, okay. It's a game of chicken. How far are we going to go? Are we actually going to get the jury in here?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Man, jury duty is great. It's like your chance to sit and read a book.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Yeah, jury duty is not so bad. Maybe it's just this particular county, because here in Sacramento it's just one day or one trial.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And they actually have really decent snacks in the cafeteria.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And that's super important.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I've actually, I made a friend that was in our wow guild because we were both on jury duty.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And we're sitting in the hallway freaking talking about our draenei and how we were looking forward to seeing what the new expansion was.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And we were all so disappointed. But yeah.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:43.000
The last time I was on jury duty, I was playing, I want to say it was Final Fantasy IV, the after years, but wasn't that only on Wii at the time?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Yes. So it must have just been Final Fantasy IV. Maybe that's when the DS cartridge came out. I bet that's what it was.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And I was playing the crap out of that for jury duty.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I just remember being so bored sitting at home. No, it wasn't because I was actually working at that other place.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000
But I went in for my jury duty and it gave me a chance to read my book and get my stuff done.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And I sadly didn't get picked for a jury because I kind of wanted to be on one so I could have the people's court thing going in my head.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I sat on one in 2006. It was terrible.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I want a nice, long murder trial.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
No, you don't. Be careful what you wish for.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Because I was on a two week trial for a criminal case that was bad. It wasn't murder, but it was very, very, very bad stuff.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And it's like one of those, I'm glad I got to do my civic duty. I'm glad I got to see Law and Order play out in front of me.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Because the very animated prosecutor was awesome to watch. She was great.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000
But I never want to be on a trial like that again in my life.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
But I actually don't mind the waiting for it just because it gives me a chance to read.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Alright, anyhow. How do we get on jury duty?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Well, it must be, it's like...

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Video games and jury duty.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Well, it's legal week here on OLR because guess what my story is about?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Another lawsuit.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:00.000
And this is one of those, oh, we must have seen this coming after all the internet rage about Mass Effect 3.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I remember when somebody tried to sue there.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Well, guess what game got targeted this time?

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Aliens Colonial Marines.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
That's right. Sega and Gearbox.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Class action lawsuit against them saying you knowingly misrepresented Aliens Colonial Marines at trade show demos.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Fascinating.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And a lot of people were bitching about this too.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Like the game that came out did not match what they were showing at E3 and all this.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
So, but I don't know.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Like can you sue a movie because the movie wasn't as good as the trailer?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And they put stuff in the trailer all the time that doesn't end up in the real movie.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I don't know though.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Well, you know, I would like, you know, the two hours of my life back for Mortal Kombat resurrection or whatever the crap it was.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
And I totally blame Jessica and Ross for making me watch that. Actually, I blame Ross for making me watch that movie.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:56.000
But I didn't go demand, you know, that people give me money or anything for a shitty movie.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I mean, I pretty much knew it was shit anyway.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
But the trailers made it look a lot more interesting than it actually was.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
And it was the sequel to the first one.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
It was actually really boring and stupid.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Alright, anyhow, Timegate Studios, maybe they can see this coming, the end is coming.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Because, of course, they are the developer behind Aliens Colonial Marines co-developer.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
And they also developed a game called Section 8.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000
They filed for bankruptcy protection at the Texas Southern Bankruptcy Court.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Apparently, owing their creditors between $10 and $50 million in debt.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
That's a hell of a price range. That's a very odd estimate.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
But, yeah, Timegate seeking protection against creditors.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Now, granted, they aren't the target of this lawsuit per se.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:46.000
But, yeah, don't release a game as bad as Aliens Colonial Marines, people.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Because in this day and age, you'll get sued over it.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
How dare you waste my time?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Then again, $60 for a game. It's a big chunk of change.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And also, they had, you know, all the media that was from it was from the, you know, pre-release thing.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
So, there was nothing like ads development goes.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Oh, hey, yeah, we had to scale back this up because it wouldn't run on a console.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Alright, well, let's travel to a time when things were a lot simpler.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
To the intro of our show.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
We got a new theme back in the day. Thank you.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
When we first started the show this evening, before we started...

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Long, long time ago. A couple hours.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Back then, we weren't talking about Final Fuck X.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
We were just talking about, you know, blowjobs. I don't know.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000
You know, back in the day, you would buy a game like, I don't know, what was it?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
ET.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000
What was a really terrible game?

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Okay, ET. And you know what? You just got stuck with it.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
There was no class action lawsuit because ET sucked.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Alright, DarkSakura, go into the gaming vault and find a game that, hey, the kids should be playing this week.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
What is the classic game of the week?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000
The classic game of the week is Magical Chase for the PC Engine.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Also known as the TurboGrafx.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I will tell you right now that this is one of the holy grails of the U.S. Turbo graphics games.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Because they did like five copies in the U.S.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I actually, I don't even, I would like a copy of this because it's actually a really neat little game.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Magical Chase was put out by Palsoft and released by Quest on the PC Engine.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Came out in 1991 in Japan and 1993 in the U.S.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
And you play as a little witch named Ripple who flies on a broomstick.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I swear I used to get this confused with cotton back in the day for the record.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
But you have...

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
It reminds me of cotton. I was going to ask if it was in that same series.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
No, it's not. Compile, I think, did cotton, didn't it?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Yeah.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Anyway, you have these little stars with you called Star Maidens and they act as your options like Ingradius.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:11.000
And that's funny, the article even compares to cotton. Success did cotton, not compile.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:18.000
But it was one of the last games that was released in the U.S. for the TurboGrafx, Turbo Duo.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And had a ton of hype and now it's like you'd be hard pressed to find a copy.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.000
So as you play through the game, you have normal and hard difficulty settings.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
You can only play the first three levels on easy.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Once your enemies are destroyed, they leave gemstones behind.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000
So that's your currency in games. You can buy power-ups, health, extra lives.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Except on the third six levels, it only appears once.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Touching stuff on the ground does not kill you, but it does slow you down.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
And if you get trapped behind objects, you get scrolling damage.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:14.000
You have your different levels. You have Cubolagon, Dodon Grin, Kamikaze Dangan, Fat Metal, which just sounds funny, Gemini Snow, and then the Sixth Seal.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So there are other ports. They did a version for Windows 95, 98 that came out in 1998.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And then they did Magical Chase GB for the Game Boy Color, only in Japan on August 4th, 2000.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And like I said, it's rare. In fact, I was about to eBay it just to see exactly if there's any copies on eBay right now.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
So let's find out.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
And honestly, it's a cute little game. I like that level because it looks like she's flying over Tetris blocks.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
It does, yeah. This is a cute little...

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
It's just the beginning of the game, too.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Very cartoony game. I like this.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Kind of Fantasy Zone, in a way. The art style.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
It's just really cute. Yeah.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Well, Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier were both set in the same universe.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
So let's see. Magical Chase.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Why are you trying to autocorrect me to Chase?

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Why don't you keep reading and I'll look it up real quick?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Well, I got it right now.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Okay, I don't want the dead air.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Anyway, Magical Chase PC Engine, the Japanese version, $229.80.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Yeah, okay. Super Rare NEC PC Engine Q card.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.000
This is still the Japanese version. $249.00. $199.00.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Even the Game Boy Color version is going for $249.00.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Dang.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
This is another Japanese...

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Okay, we have the soundtrack for $50.00.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
So yeah, Magical Chase, even the Japanese versions are going for quite a bit of money.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
The soundtracks are going for money.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Basically, anything related to Magical Chase is fetching some money.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
So, good luck.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
If someone happens to find me a Magical Chase, give it to me.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Alright.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
But yeah, I'd say if any of you happen to have the game,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.000
you've got a celebrity, a small internet celebrity,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
who would make puppy eyes at you until you give it to her.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Or panorama cotton. Those are like on my list.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Although, to be honest, if I saw this and then I saw Radiant Silver Gun

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
right next to it to get for Dan,

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I think that I would do the right thing and get this for myself.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Good answer. Very good answer.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Actually, I don't think Dan would follow me.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Alright.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Magical Chase, no relation to cotton.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
But a small resemblance to Fantasy Zone.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
But she doesn't go, wheel-o!

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Alright. Good pick. I knew nothing about this game,

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
and now I'm looking at it going, gosh, I want to play this.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Too bad I'll have to emulate it.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000
You can get, it is out there too.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Of course it is. Of course it is.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
And I would not blame a single soul for downloading the game,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
just saying. In my, allegedly.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
You know, a game that's this hard to find, that's this old,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I mean, who could really fault you for it?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
If it was on virtual console or something, we'd say go get it.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
You better believe I have an emulated copy of panorama cotton

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
since they made 600 total in the world, so.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week segment.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
We're gonna take a break. When we come back,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
plenty of more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Xbox rumors, yippee yay.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
We only have a few more weeks to sit through those.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Also talking about some free-to-play stuff on Wii U.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Call of Duty, yes. And plenty more.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Your calls and the Fugu Question of the Week,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
all about pinball tonight. Duty.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
right after this.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Live on this Cinco de Mayo, May 5th, 2013,

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
with episode 503 of our show already in progress.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
And if you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network,

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
vognetwork.com, you missed some pretty lively debates

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
in the first half of the show, so we hope you will check that out

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
in the podcast feed.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I also have to give apologies here at the start of this segment

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
to our friends over at Anime Jam Session.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
They put on a lovely show, which is on Tuesday nights

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
at the Voice of Geeks Network,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
and it's 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern,

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
and they rebroadcast Thursday mornings.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
They sent us a bumper for the 500th episode

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
that I still haven't played,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
because I was trying to sync it to music a couple weeks ago,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
and I literally ran out of time because it wasn't working,

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
and I just forgot to do it today.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And I've also been procrastinating it because

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
nobody else except Flaco sent us a bumper.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
So please take a look at the post in our forums

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
and send us more bumpers,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
and then I'll have reasons to play them all.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
But I also want to give a shout-out to our pals over there

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
at Anime Jam Session, because

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I got a lovely package in the mail,

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
a mail package,

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
from Rama this week

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
that sent us some cards.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Was it stuffed? Yes, it was stuffed

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
with these Cards Against Humanity boosters

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
from PAX East.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
So these are going to be pretty hard to come by in California,

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
or many parts of the nation.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
So, awesome.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
We kept one or two for ourselves,

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
but we are going to be looking to give away

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
these Pack A and Cs

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
that we got. Sadly no Bs, but hey,

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
you know what? Bakers can't be choosers.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
So some of these Pack As and Cs we're going to give to you guys,

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
the listeners, in coming weeks of the show.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
And maybe if there's like a live event

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
coming up, like Fanime or something,

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I'll take some of these with me to that,

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
and you can win them from me there too.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
So yeah,

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
thank you very much to our pals over there.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I think Brad's first in line now.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Wow, what did Brad say?

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Oh, I sent you guys booze, what else do you want?

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Yeah, Brad,

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
you make a good case.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I guess I should be sending him some Cards Against Humanity

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
cards for sure.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
We trade goods amongst the Voice

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
of Geeks network shows. The bartering system.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Yeah, bartering system. You give me booze,

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I give you cards.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I didn't give Anime Jam Session anything yet,

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
but I will...

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Rama has my heart.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
That's what they have.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Alright.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
To register participation for this

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
on Vognetwork.com, use the pass

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
phrase, FLAG.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Anyhow, let us get back

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
into some gaming news. Rapid Fire

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
news for this Part B. Loki.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Borderlands has, well, originally

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
it kind of leaked out from a

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
picture, but it has

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
now been officially announced. Tiny

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
is going to be the next piece of DLC,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
or I should say the last

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
piece or fourth piece of the game's

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
season pass. Did they make her politically correct yet?

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
No. So it's sort of

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
a play on Dungeons and Dragons

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
and, you know,

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
it'll be interesting. So that's

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
supposed to be coming out June 25th.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
It will be included in the season

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
pass, so if you have that. Otherwise, it's

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
ten bucks.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
There's a new game console

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
trailer this week.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
It's not even really a game console as much

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
as it's more of like an analog

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
video game synthesizer. It's a

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
thing called Ming Meka

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
and it's really

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
strange. I mean, it works just like a synthesizer

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
so it has a lot of analog,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
you know, physical cords that you're

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
plugging into the stuff and, you know, dials

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
you're tweaking and that sort of thing.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
And it kind of, it makes

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
music, like a synthesizer, and also

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
kind of does an interactive display.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Like, you could do games and

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
stuff sort of on it. Very basic

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
glitchy looking things.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I see this more as like

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
something that you would see with like chiptune

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
artists or something like that kind of messing around

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
with, you know, in like a live performance

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
type setting because it

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
seems like that would, you know,

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
play well to it. Plus, it is open

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
source, so you

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
can actually, you know, build one

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
yourself if you want.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Or they're going to be selling it. They said they

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
estimate the console is going to be

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
anywhere from, you know,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
um, you know,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
was it $350 for the control core

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
or $1,000 for the world core?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Because it's a few, I mean,

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
we're talking like it is a synthesizer, so

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
it's kind of in the realm of that.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
It makes sense price-wise. As a video game

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
console, not so much. But it does get

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
controlled partially within the NES controller, so

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
it looks interesting.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Um,

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
and last but not least, the

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
kick-started project, or it was

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
attempted to be kick-started, but it kind of failed.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Um, Project Awakened

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
has now, um,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
put itself on hold, I guess,

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
due to alternate funding

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
options and donors

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
are now receiving refunds. In other words,

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
somebody is picking this thing

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
up and will probably publish it.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
So, that's kind of cool.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Because it looks kind of interesting.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
One of the first Unreal 4 games

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
that's kind of like a first person,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
or a third person

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
superhero action

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
game. So, could be neat.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Alright.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Going over to some news from Level 5.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
You know Level 5, they made Ni No Kuni,

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
was one of their more recent developing games.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Dragon Quest 8, of course, you know, they've done

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
a lot of games. White Knight Chronicles.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Well, they have some trademarks

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
out there that have been filed. It's

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
reported that they have filed trademarks for

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Rare Drop Adventure Note,

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Earth Devastating

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
B-Rank Girlfriend.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
That's what it's called.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
That's an awesome title.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
And Wonder Flick. That's kind of a neat

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
little sounding thing too. They were all

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
trademarked by the developer all around the same time.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Who knows what this could be? These could be three

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
titles in one series. These could all be

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
new games in development.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
They could be Red Herrings. Who knows? They could be

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
anything. But I hope

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
they all sound like neat

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
titles. So, whatever they are, they're pretty kick-ass.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
But of course, you know, you can't

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
judge a game based off its title. But these are good

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
starts. But we don't know anything else

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
about these. Maybe E3?

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Maybe Tokyo Game Show?

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
It sounds like it might be

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
the third Guild

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
game. They always have these

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
weird kind of indie games that are

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
a prize of that. So, maybe

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
these are titles in that.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Okay, that's a good theory.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Also, Nintendo apparently

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
going to be introducing Retro Studio's new

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
project in the not-so-distant

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
future. Could this be

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
E3 or a Nintendo Direct?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Who knows? But

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Hiro Yamada said, quote,

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I wonder what kind of game it is. I hope

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
to introduce it to you in the not-so-distant

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
future.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Interesting. That's in an

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
interview with Official Nintendo.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Well, what? Official Nintendo Magazine. Must be over in

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Japan because they don't have one here anymore.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
So, I'll tell you what it should be.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
What? It should be

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
a new Excite Shark game.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
It's the UK Official Nintendo Magazine.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
It should be a new Excite Shark game. Is that what you want Retro Studios

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
to be working on? That would sell me a system.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
A new Excite Truck game. That's good.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I'm not talking fucking

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Excitebots trick racing.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Because that was absolute shit.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
I will be tickled pink if

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
it's a new Metroid or a new F-Zero.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Especially a new F-Zero.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
That would be pretty cool. I mean, at least that's a

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
racing game, Loki. You gotta get excited about that a little bit.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Come on. HD.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Super fast. Alright. Anyhow.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Also, this may or may not be

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
something up Dark Sakura's alley. I don't know if she's really

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
into this series anymore. I don't have any alleys.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
The Sims 4.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Oh, you're not so much a Sims

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
girl anymore? If it

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
manages memory better and lets me get in more

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
fun mods, then

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
yeah, but Sims 3 played like shit.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Well, Sims

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Is it online only? Well,

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
the rumor is, yes it is.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
But what, I mean, of course

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
that rumor's gonna be out there after what happened with

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
SimCity. It will be very interesting to see how

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
what happened with SimCity plays into this.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Regardless, we all know it's gotta happen

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
eventually, but it looks like it's something that could be

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
happening relatively soon. They are

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
saying this could actually be announced tomorrow,

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
May 6th. So by the time many of you hear

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
this podcast, it could have been announced.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
This is due to a web domain

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
registration, apparently by EA.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Which I would have thought you would grab the Sims 4

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
name a hell of a long time ago. Whatever.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
The studio is holding a conference

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
call tomorrow. Supposed to be making a

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
major announcement. So what the hell else would it be?

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Except maybe five more Sims 3 expansions!

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Yes!

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
They have about that, Maynie.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
You wanna know what's really sad?

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Is that with Sims 3, the

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
stuff that the mod community's been doing

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
is worlds better

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
than any of the official stuff

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
that EA put out. I mean, even

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
down to custom furniture,

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
everything, the fan community has just been

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
perfect, and I would love for

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
it would actually, I would buy it

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
if they would hire some of the

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
mod people. The people who have done mods. Well, they're not Valve.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I know, but I'm saying

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
that would sell it for me right there, is

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
certain people in the

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
custom community. You don't want to be always

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
connected? No!

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I hate people.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Because Sims

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
because Sims Online

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Sims Online worked so well.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Rob. And also the Sims Social worked so

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
well that they're totally closing

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
that game. Actually, Sims Social was, everybody

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
was fucking playing that. I played Sims

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Social. That came and went.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Like, I kind of wish Candy Crush Saga would

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I finally blocked it this week, y'all. I couldn't

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
anymore with Candy Crush. I couldn't. And then

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
what happens last night, I'm lying in bed

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
and I hear this very familiar song and I'm like

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
what are you doing over there on your phone, Alan?

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I'm stuck on level 29

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
in Candy Crush Saga. No!

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
You can't

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
escape. For the record, I don't hate

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
people, just most people.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
You love

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
all our listeners, right? Yeah.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Okay, good.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Yeah, I love you guys.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
No, seriously.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I love you guys. Seriously. Seriously.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Love you, mean it. Seriously. Alright, Dark

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Soccer, what do you got for us? I am not

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Grumpy Cat.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I'm not Grumpy Cat. I'm

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Disgruntled Cat.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Anyway, Square

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Enix is remastering

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
soundtracks from Final Fantasy games.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
We will be seeing the Final Fantasy

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
4 one released

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
on, looks like July 3rd

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
this year.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
That's the first one they're starting

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
with and they're going to have box art done

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
especially by

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Yoshitaka Amano

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
and then

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
of course we're probably not going to see it in

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
the US, but

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Square Enix does do digital releases

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
for a lot of their albums so we might see it on iTunes.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
iTunes. Of course,

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
you know, if you actually want a physical CD so that

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
you can get the awesome artwork, there's always CD

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
from Japan.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Also,

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Break Man, I am not hating your faces.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Okay, I don't hate anyone's

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
faces.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Also, we have

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
a notice that there is

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
a DVD out called 100 yen

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
the Japanese Arcade Experience

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
which is a

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
documentary about

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
arcade culture in Japan.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
There's a trailer for it out if you're

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
interested in looking at it, but

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
not only does it talk about

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
just gaming, arcade

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
gaming in Japan, it does talk about the US

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
and Canada as well, and the

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
casual gamers.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
So,

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
and last but not least,

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
for people who are pinball

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
fans, like me,

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Pinball FX 2 is coming

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
to Steam. The game

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
itself will be free, but the tables will be

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
10 bucks a pop. 6 pounds

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
for our British listeners.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
And that's including Star Wars

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Pinball, Marvel Pinball, Marvel Pinball

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Legends of Virtue, Marvel Pinball

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Avengers Chronicles, Pinball FX

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
2 Core Collection, and

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Zen Classics.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
I had a

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
pretty good time playing it. It sort of gave

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
me some of the feel of

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
pinmame, but

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
not

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
quite. They're

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
all original stuff, so it was pretty neat.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
That's cool. Yeah.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Alright, so let's move

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
on a little bit to some

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
actual, I

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
don't know,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Xbox rumors, if you will.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
This week,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
it was made known that

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Microsoft has registered

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
the domain for Xbox

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Fusion, and

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
also

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
some other stuff related to XboxFusion.de,

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
XboxFusion.co.uk,

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
XboxFusion.biz.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
So,

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
one would think, hey,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
you know, Xbox Fusion, that could be

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
a name of a console, maybe.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Maybe.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
So,

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
good chances are that

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
might be actually what they're gonna finally call the

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
console.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Maybe a little bit better than

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Xbox Lube, I don't know, I mean.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Unless they're having a

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
service called Fusion.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
That's true, I guess they could have that

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
as well, but

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
at least there is something that's gonna be

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
kind of relating

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
to the Xbox that's gonna be named Fusion,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
so we'll see if it's actually the console, or

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
it's not a bad name for a console, I guess.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
It could work. It just

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
seems like they arbitrarily picked a name out of their

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
asses. Fusion sounds cool,

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
let's call it that.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Then also, there is

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
a rumor that the next,

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
or the first,

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I guess, debut game of

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Respawn Entertainment is gonna

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
actually be this game

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
called Titan, and

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
some information has kind of

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
leaked out about it already,

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
saying that the game

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
is gonna revolve around

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
these giant mechs,

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
called Titans, and so it's kind of a

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
multiplayer shooter game, but

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
then it's also gonna have these giant mechs as well,

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
kind of think it's a little bit like MechWarrior,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
but maybe more of the

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
scale of, it kind of reminds me of

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Command & Conquer Generals, and

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
MechWarrior.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
The Titan thing is really funny, because Blizzard

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
has that Project Titan thing right now.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
We all know that's not the real name of the game,

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
but it's just funny that

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
there is a game called Titan, maybe.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
And then,

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
what else?

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
And apparently,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
this might be exclusive to the next

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
platform. I'm assuming it's gonna be exclusive

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
for a limited amount of time. I don't know if it's gonna be

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
exclusive forever, but probably at launch.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
And Microsoft's had a few deals like this

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
with the DLC, Windows, and all that.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Skyrim, right, had that?

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Yeah, Skyrim

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
did. Call of Duty does,

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
and did.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Grand Theft Auto did.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Ah, yeah.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
There's been a lot.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
And then,

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
of course,

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Illumaroom had a new trailer this week,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
and for those who don't remember,

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Illumaroom is this brand new

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
peripheral that's gonna tie in with the

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Xbox 360, or the new Xbox,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
and perhaps PCs

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
as well, to kind of

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
extend the play field

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
for your games. And the way it's being

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
done, they actually showed the device this time, so

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
we don't have to imagine what it looks like.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
It's all very prototype right

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
now, but right now,

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
it's basically a projector

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
attached to a Kinect sensor,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
and the Kinect sensor scans the room,

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
and so it actually will,

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
you can use it for

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
special effects, you can use it to

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
increase, you know, your

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
field of view, you can also

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
use it for, like,

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
indicators and

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
stuff in the game,

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
and the way it does everything, it actually

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
projects stuff in there and will manipulate,

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
like, you can actually have, like, a ripple

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
effect come out of the screen, and

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
it just looks really cool. But

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
this is something that you

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
were really only gonna see, I guess, a public demo

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
of it as early

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
as July is when they're gonna

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
publicly demo this, and it's not expected

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
to be something that the system launches with if it

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
does eventually. Which might have bummed out some people

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
that were kind of looking forward to something like that.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
The concept looked really cool.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
I would be worried that if they launched this

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
with the console, which, don't get me wrong, I think

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
if they could get it in the console and have

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
the price of it be cheap enough,

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
because adding a projector,

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
an HD projector, and

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
another Kinect sensor. Yeah, but what if it's

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
not, like, the images itself,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
if it's just, like, colored lights and things

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
like that that enhance the- But it's actually,

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
it's a project- I mean, it looks neat.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I mean, it looked neat. Maybe that's what they're still trying to figure

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
out, is the- The problem is, though, is

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
they envision it as, like, a projector

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
that sits on a coffee table. So once again,

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
you're talking

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Kinect sensor- I don't got a coffee table!

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
That's for rich people! Exactly. I don't have a coffee

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
table, I don't have this, you know,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
you're limiting it now to

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
okay, it's gonna have this, this thing

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
that's gonna sit on a coffee table. Well, hey, hold on a second.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
If I have to have a coffee

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
table in my room, this projector's gonna sit- Where do I play

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Kinect? Exactly, exactly.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
But you're telling me to move the coffee table out of the

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
way to play the Kinect games? I'm confused!

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I am not rearranging the goddamn furniture

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
to play Xbox. What do you want me to do with this coffee

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
table? Microsoft

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
unveils the easily movable coffee

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
table. It moves out! It moves back in!

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
It put sensors on it, it put

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
coffee on it! It's great. The Microsoft

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
transformer coffee table, wah wah wah.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
It's coming to you from IKEA!

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
That would mean you'd

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
have to build it yourself, and it would have a name

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
like Sfarce

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Gardevan. Or Billy.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Well, that's the bookcase, sorry.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Alright. There you go, Xbox

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Fusion is the new coffee table.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
This system

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
is the coffee table.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
It fuses to your coffee table. It is the

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
coffee table. It becomes one with

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
the coffee table. It hopefully has nothing to do with

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Fusion Frenzy. Let's

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
pray, please. That has nothing to do with

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Fusion Frenzy. Or what if, what if

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
or we could see the headlines now.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
There's a frenzy for the new Xbox

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Fusion. It's a Fusion Frenzy!

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Break! Ahhhh!

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Break Man in our chatroom at live.hug

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
at live.hugnetwork.com says

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Xbox needs to move the coffee table

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
its damn self.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
That's really hilarious. Setting up

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
room for Kinect.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
It just

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
knocks over your coffee table.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
It disappears into the floor

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
with everything that was left on it.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Pushes the cat out of the way.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Meow!

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
With Xbox Fusion's new

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
telekinetic abilities

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
it can move your furniture for you.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Arrange in room for Kinect.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
That would be hilarious. I want one of those giant

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
holes that opens up in the ground to drop

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
people I don't like out of sight forever. Creating the

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
high wall. Couch moves in the place.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Alright, now we're getting

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
stupid. Let's get to the foogle question

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
of the week.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Facebook, Google Plus.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Slam them together, you get foogle.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
It's the foogle question of the week. Every week

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
we ask a question of our fan communities and read

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
some of our favorite answers here on the show.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Again, like last week, way

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
too many answers. I can only read

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
some of them tonight. I'm sorry guys. Let's start

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
on Google Plus with the

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
answer to the question about pinball.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
DarkSakura likes to talk about

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
pinball a lot on the show.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
A lot you guys. She talks about it

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
a lot. She's talked about it five minutes ago.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
We played pinball last night.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Also in the news this week we are hearing

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
that pinball FX2 is coming to steam as she

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
mentioned a minute ago. What do you think about

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
pinball? Are there some pinball tables that you

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
can't pass up playing when you see them?

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
How about pinball video games? Are there any favorites

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
that you have or will you only play the

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
real thing? Let's go to Google Plus with some of the answers

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
here. IceP on

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Google Plus. I love

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
that name. I think my favorite

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
simulators were Pinball Dreams, Pinball

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Fantasies, and Slam Tilt on the

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Amiga. You just

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
the very first thing a listener named was my

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
absolute favorite. Pinball Dreams was on the

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
PC as well. I know it was more known as an Amiga

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
game. I think it was amazing and Pinball Fantasies

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
was great too. I'm sorry

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I just had one of those random thoughts. What?

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
There's a Commodore 64 set that works for

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
iCade. Just letting you know.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Oh, the emulator thingy? I have

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
that.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Stoked. Anyway, back to pinball.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
How can you of all people

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
change the topic away from pinball?

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Shame on you. Now we're talking about

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Dragon Crush?

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Going back to IceP.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I love the fact that these weren't real

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
tables. The way no one could

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
unfavorably compare them to the real thing.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Plus it allowed them the freedom to let their

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
imagination run wild.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Panaxium says, I remember my first pinball

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
game was Moraff's Pinball back on the

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
386. I was too young

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
to understand how awful of a game that was.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Later I got hooked on Epic Pinball

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
and that was a blast. However, I don't think

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I ever had the chance to play a real pinball table.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Really?

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
You never played a real pinball table?

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I guess maybe that's one of those things I take for granted.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Bars. I mean, maybe you're not

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
a bar person, but a lot of bars have them.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Have pinball tables.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Bowling alleys? I don't know if that's a thing.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Movie theaters.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
And John's Incredibly

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Crappy Pizza. You need to go find a pinball

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
table, son. Alright, Travis

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
H. on Google Plus says, I love

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
pinball. Used to play the Addams Family table

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
until my quarters ran dry at a rec center

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
here in Florida. Also love the Indiana

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Jones table. I play a lot of Zen pinball

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
on my Vita. Collecting the tables

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
and going back and forth with friends trying

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
to top scores. Great game.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Remember Prop Cycle Addams Family?

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Yes!

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Wasn't that at California Extreme or something?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
I need to figure out when that is this year.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Pinagogo's coming up in a couple months too, by the way.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Is it really? Yeah. I need to get these things on the calendar.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I just, isn't

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
We're taking our jackpot. Isn't California Extreme

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
almost always the last weekend in July because

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I bet you it's the same frickin' day as Clue.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I bet you anything. Uh, that might be.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
But I know that for, well, Pinagogo's

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
the one in Dixon, and we're taking

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
jackpot there because

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
the creator of jackpot in a bunch

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
of the series is gonna be at

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Pinagogo this year.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
No, it's July 13th to 14th this year.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I'll be in rehearsals that weekend,

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
but maybe I can go on Sunday

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
at least. We should still make it happen.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I know, I should. It'll be fun.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Anyhow, where were we?

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
We're going to Facebook. Those are some of the answers

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
from Google+. Please check out our community on Google+.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
to read them all. And I'm gonna read

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
some of the answers here on Facebook as well.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Andy R. says

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I still don't quite get pinball.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
It's fun to play, but I have

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
no clue how to score well in it, and I always

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
suck. I'm the guy that loses the ball

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
in the first 10 seconds and gets saved by

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
the noobsaver feature. I bought

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Pinball Arcade on PS3 Vita

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
recently after kickstarting the Star Trek

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
table. It's pretty fun, even if my scores

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
are abysmal, and it's a good distraction

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
if I've got my Vita on me and I need to kill some time

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
while I'm out. Any tips for Andy?

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
There's actually

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
a series of DVDs out.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
We've got a few of them, but a lot of them

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
have been put on YouTube.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
It actually teaches you a little bit of the physics

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
involved with a well-balanced pinball table.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
A lot of it is learning how to

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
catch the ball with your flippers

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
and learning where your

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
triggers are, because pretty much it's

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
really just a game of physics.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Here's the

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
most common mistake new players make

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
is that they hit both flippers at the same time.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Don't ever do that.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
The only time that might work

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
is multi-ball, when it just so happens

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
to be timed that way. But you've got to get yourself

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
out of the habit of hitting both flippers at the same

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
time, and if you can do that, that's the first step.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
And if you are just trying to keep from draining,

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
keep your eye on the flippers.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
When you see that ball

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
coming to your field of vision, hit whatever

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
flipper it's going towards. Now I want to play some pinball.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Come to my house.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Come to my house! Jeremy J,

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
my buddy from Koopa Club,

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I want to give a shout out to that podcast. They're a

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
fun little bunch. They just had a drunkie episode

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
not that long ago either. Those are fun.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
So, looking forward to meeting him in

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
August when they come out here for Gamer X.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
But anyway, Jeremy J says,

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
I'm dreadful at pinball in every form,

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
whether it's on an actual table or a digital

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
version. That doesn't stop me from really

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
enjoying it though. I sunk 10 plus hours

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
into Zen Pinball 2 and didn't even realize it.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
In terms of tables I wouldn't pass

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
up. Anything horror related

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
would have to get at least one go from me.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Twilight Zone, Creature from the Black

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Girl Goon, etc. Creature is awesome.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
You used to have that one. We did.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Gaming Nerd says,

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
real pinball is the way to go. While some

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
pinball video games like Zen Pinball keep the idea

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
alive without having to build an actual table

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
from the ground up, it just doesn't feel the same

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
as playing on real tables. With a real

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
pinball table, the physics with the ball and the

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
angle of the table are as real as it gets.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Video game pinball is emulated realism

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
and can still run the risk of a bug

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
in the physics engine used to simulate

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
the ball's movement and hit detection against

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
the bumpers, flippers, etc.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Plus, who doesn't love a machine full of

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
flashing lights and that deafening loud knocker

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
when you earn a free game? Not

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
going to disagree with you, Gaming Nerd, but

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
the real machines can be full of bugs, too.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
The ball's getting stuck,

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
magnets not working.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
For example, we have a problem with our Twilight Zone

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
right now, where if it doesn't warm up properly,

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
the game will reset itself halfway through

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
the first ball. We

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
had to, actually for

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
pinball tables, for them to work properly, they have to be

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
very well calibrated. They have to be balanced.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
They have to, you have to

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
make sure that your contacts are clean. You have to make sure

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
the balls are clean.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Do you always make sure

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
the balls are clean, Dark Sakura?

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Well, we had a mention of

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Twilight Zone earlier. With Twilight Zone,

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
they also use

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
ceramic balls.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
For Powerball,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
shut up.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
You guys should see the look on Rob's face.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
It's maybe a little

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
troll face. Do you shine

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
the balls yourself?

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
You know what? Bite me.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Another thing, too, tables are

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
actually waxed, especially if they're

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
wood

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
surface tables. There's a lot

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
that has to be done. Even the type of leg that

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
you use, because we have those nice brass ones

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
on the World Cup. Sometimes even the

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
leg you use on it, but so much goes into

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
the balance of the game. You have so many different

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
components to make sure it works.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Upkeep of

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
a physical table

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
is going to make or break you playing the game.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
So, would you say that after

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
extended play on a wax table, that the balls would

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
eventually become waxed as well?

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Breakman in chat says, my balls need a good

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
shining. You can shine your own damn balls.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Well, maybe after the show, he should just go do that.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I don't want to know about it.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
It's just pinball. Alright,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
VX JasonXV

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
in chat asks a real question here.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
What is the reason for the free game

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
knocker? That's a good question. Why is that fucking

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
so loud when you win a free game? Is that just to

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
draw attention in the arcade? Tradition.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Oh, tradition? I don't know. I think maybe

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
actually, my thought of it being so loud

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
is that, this is my own theory,

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
is that it's so loud in an arcade

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
that they want to draw attention

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
to that you won one. That's what I figured.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
However, we were

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I was playing jackpot last, actually

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Deanna who

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
was one of our DDR friends. Hi, Deanna.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Does she listen to the show? Probably not.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
She's at a baseball game tonight

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
in Fresno. Okay. It's like, you're going to Fresno?

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Well, with all those long flights

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
to Japan, you would think she listens to some podcasts.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Yeah. Well, at any

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
rate, she was

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
playing World Cup, Dan was playing

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Twilight, and I was playing jackpot. Those are the only three we have

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
left. And then Dan got

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
an extra ball because he was really good at

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Twilight Zone. And I swear, I

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
tilted the machine, or

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
almost tilted the machine just because I

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
wasn't expecting it. It was so loud.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
That's something that new pinball players should know about

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
too, is that tilting the machine

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
is okay. It's

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
about finding the right balance. You can't

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
slam the thing too much, but a little

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
smack, you just got to slap it on the ass

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
a little bit to get those

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
balls right where you got to get them.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
The sweet spot for most tables is going to

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
be right past the flipper. Yeah, tell us

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
about that sweet spot. Shut up.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
And you use the palm of your

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
bottom of your palm. You know what? Bye.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
And she's left.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
I can't help it.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
You're talking about the sweet spot.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
How about the listeners? Back to the

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
listeners on Facebook.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Burr says, my favorite

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
pinball game of all time is pinball

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
construction set. I loved making my

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
own pinball tables on my Apple 2.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Where the hell is the Kickstarter for a remake?

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
I hear ya, except

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
replace Apple 2 with Commodore 64

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
and that was me. That game was awesome.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Like a Sega game too, where you can make

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
a Genesis game that you can make pinball

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
tables. They did, didn't they? I don't remember

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
what it was called, but I remember at the back of the box there they had one

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
that was like one bumper and

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
all the flippers you could possibly fit on

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
the screen. All flippers.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
That was all it was. Fabrice

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
A says, sadly, pinball machines

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
have become even more rare than arcade

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
cabinets. I do enjoy pinball a lot.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Once you know how to score big,

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
it's super addictive. I've played my fair share

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
of pinball tables. Independence Day, High Roller,

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
The Simpsons, Roller Coaster Tycoon,

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Lord of the Rings, and the list goes on. The one I enjoyed

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
the most was The Addams Family.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Very intricate.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Now Jamie, do they have a good Game of Thrones

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
table? Cause I would imagine that, you know,

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
that'd be pretty popular. If it's gonna

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
come out, there would be Stern making it.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
But Stern, I think,

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
has a...

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
What was the last one that Stern did? Was it

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Tron Legacy? I'm gonna have to check now.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
They actually have

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
a deluxe one that has all the neon lights

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
and everything around it too.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Shattered Hawk says, the girlfriend

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
and I go to the Nickel Cade about once

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
or twice a month. We spend most of the time

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
playing the Star Trek and Addams Family

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
pinball games. And lastly,

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Edgar R says, I love pinball. I never

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
passed up The Simpsons at my old local pub.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Again, those are just some of the answers from

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Facebook and Google+. Sorry, I didn't have time to read

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
them all. And tonight, I kind of picked people

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
that don't usually get in chat and I don't

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
usually hear from on the show in other ways.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Trying to spread the love around a little bit. So,

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
I do encourage all our listeners though to read the

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
complete list of answers at Facebook.com.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Metallica pinball is the last one.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
They have a Metallica pinball?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
They're gonna fuck that up just like they did

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Guitar Hero. I think they also did a Kiss pinball as well.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Hold on. No, that's cool.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Alright.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Let's get back into some other news.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Oh, I guess it's my turn for other news too.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Nintendo possibly

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
going into more free to play software.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
I want to say we heard this rumor before.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
But this is about something that happened

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
with Satoru Iwata and I

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
think it was in an interview

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
that was actually on Nintendo.co.jp

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
The company is looking beyond

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
digital distribution and is thinking about free to

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
play games. Question.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
You talked about Nintendo's digital

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
business in the presentation. I remember you said

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
that in addition to the package software business

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
the digital business could be a core business

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
for Nintendo. Could you please give an indication

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
as to how much you expect to generate in

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
digital sales this fiscal year and the next?

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Also, apart from replacing package

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
distribution with digital distribution

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
I understand that you are developing network based

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
products such as Wii Street U powered

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
by Google. Do you expect to be able to

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
make hit network based products and create a buzz

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
in society? Here's the answer.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Also, as you pointed out, we think

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
the digital distribution of package software

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
is only the first step in expanding our digital

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
business. We will not simply

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
change our existing package software

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
distribution channel. Rather, we might

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
have many other types of business models

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
in addition to package software.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
For example, we might see more games

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
that are similar to free to play games,

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
games that cost much less, or games

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
that require a monthly subscription fee.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
That would be uncharted territory for

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Nintendo. Digitalization allows

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
for greater flexibility whereby having

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
more ways to make payments, both software

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
developers and consumers have more options.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
And Nintendo 3DS and Wii U

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
have flexible systems to handle such

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
treads, so it is now a question of

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
putting these ideas into action. I

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
can definitely say that Nintendo will make

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
new offers that go well beyond

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
simply replacing package software

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
with digital software.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Now that doesn't necessarily mean

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
free to play, but certainly they are looking

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
at mixing things up a little bit and not just

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
being digital versions of the same

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
stuff. I think Jamie's

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
next story ties into this a little bit as well,

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
so I'll let her go next and we'll come back to this.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Although I do

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
want to say, I will say real quick, I

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
played that Wii Street U by Google. I was

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
messing around with that on the Wii U a little bit this week.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
I had no idea that

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
on Google Maps now, they're taking

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
pictures inside of places.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Like, even like there's a nail

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
salon up the street, you can look inside

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
it and do the whole panoramic. Have you heard of

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
what's it called, the secret door or something?

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
It uses that inside view

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
it takes you

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
to random places around the world.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
There's an animation

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
of a door opening and then you're

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
quote inside with the

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Google view. I had no idea

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
that this was, I guess, I tweeted

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
about it because I'm like, whoa, the Wii U thing

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
lets you go inside places now and somebody

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
responded and said, actually Google

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
added that a while ago. I guess I missed that

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
but that was, that's crazy. Now I have to ask

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
the software I know is free right now.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Yeah. But

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
it's not going to be free forever.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Is this something that someone would actually pay for?

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
I mean, because it seems kind of dumb.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
No, because it's a little choppy. I mean

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
it's neat, it's a really neat concept.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
But

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
it's probably like internet browser where it's going to be

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
free for forever and then they'll charge for it at some point.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
That's what I'm saying.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Well, they have this other thing that they're charging for

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
that are videos. Like, you can

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
download a video of a double decker

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
tour thing going through, you know, parts

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
of London and you can do the whole pan

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
around with the thing. But they want to

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
charge you like $1.50 for

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
a couple minute, essentially like a two minute video.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
That's silly. But there's a demo

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
that has a little bit of all of them and

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
that's well enough. Anyway, sorry Jamie.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Alright, well, um,

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
for people who own a Wii U, there

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
is a freebie out there.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Tank Tank Tank is free on the Wii U

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
eShop. Um, and then

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
there's paid DLC.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
And then there's also Kung Fu Rabbit.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
So, uh, there also

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
are virtual console updates with other

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
games, um, including, these aren't

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
free by the way. Pac-Man and Mega-Man

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
are five bucks a pop.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
And then, um,

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
there are also, let's see,

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
there's some sales. There's Nano Assault Neo.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Zen Pinball 2.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
And then on the 3DS, there will be

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Bear Shark. Bear Shark.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Okay. Gummy Bear's Magical

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Medallion. My Writing Stables 3D.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Armageddon Operation Dragon.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Balloon Fight. Yay.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Um, and then on sale will be Marvel Pinball

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
3D. 3D Classics Kirby's

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Adventure. Uh, Dylan's

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Rolling Western. Pushmo.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Fluidity Spin Cycle. That just makes

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
me think of laundry.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Um, Tokyo Crash Mobs, Nano Assault

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
EX, Art of Balance Touch, and Fun

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Fun Mini Golf Touch.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Cool. Alright.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Uh, oh wait, I just want to say real quick. I actually played

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
the Tang Tang Tank. I downloaded it. Cause

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
now Nintendo has that cutting edge

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
technology where it finally downloads things in the background.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
So I just set it up to download the one gig thing,

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
whatever. It's really crippled

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
because you can't even do story mode in

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
it. All you can do is you can do like the versus mode

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
or whatever like three times a day.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
And it's kind of silly. Like,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
there's not a lot to it. I was

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
I was, you can't do it online

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
or anything. Like, what's the point

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
of Tang Tang Tank with the silly pictures

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
if you can't play it online? It's not free to play. It's a demo.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Yes, it is. It's a demo.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
It's not free to play. It's not free to play, yeah.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
So it's weird to me that we're calling this

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
free to play. I mean, I understand that's how the news

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
is reporting it. That's how Namco and Nintendo

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
and all that. It's a demo.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
But it's just a demo you can kind of keep playing

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
over and over again. I mean, maybe that's

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Well, you can't keep playing

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
it over and over again because you're locked

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
three times. Then you run out of energy.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I'm sorry.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Let me put it this way.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
That, I think the whole like time

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
limit demo thing, you know, for

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
you know, multiple

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
plays is stupid.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Saints Row, when that first came out

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
as a demo, was a 30 minute demo. I played

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
the crap out of it. I played it over and over and over again.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
And it got me really hyped about the game.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
If I was only limited to play that three times a day,

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
say, oh hey, I want to

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
show my friend this game that's really awesome

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
that I'm super hyped up about. Oh fuck, I can't play

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
it until tomorrow because they're being fucktards

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
about it. I mean, it's stupid.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
YYR in chat says, got news

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
for you, Tank Tank Tank's retail version doesn't

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
have online play either. You know, I feared

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
that and how

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
derpy dumb is that? That should have

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
been an obvious thing to

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
put in the game, but no.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
It just seems to me like that's a game though that,

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
and I was excited about it for a while, but it just seems like

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
it would lose something being outside of the arcade too.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yeah, especially when you're sitting in the house

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
playing it by yourself, it's just not the same, you know?

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Well, no one wants to play by themselves, Rob.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Well, apparently Break Man does.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
If you remember earlier.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Playing with yourself really should only be like, nevermind.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I liked playing it in the

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
arcade because I could just reach over and smack Dan

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
in the head. Sometimes.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
I like taking the pictures

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
with the little wigs and things.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Alan said I looked like Nicki Minaj in one of them.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Great!

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Actually, one of my old live journal

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
icons is the little tank with the squid

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
in it going, thank you.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
So.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Let's move on, Logie.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Alright, so let's see.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Let's talk about

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Call of Duty. And I mean, we kind of knew this

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
was coming because they had all this

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
stuff at retailers, posters

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
and information were leaking out about

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Call of Duty Ghosts. And they finally

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
had their announcement, yes, it's

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
going to be coming out. It isn't as

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
it was rumored to be coming out on

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
next gen only. It's going to be coming out on

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Playstation 3, Xbox 360

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
and PC on November 5th

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
and also next generation platforms

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
at an unspecified date.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
No Wii U version was announced

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
and I can also confirm that there is no

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Wii U version as of right now.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Unless it's something that they're saving for some

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Wii U thing that they're going to say, oh by the way

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
it's Wii U now too. But

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
I just don't know if they made their money

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
back on the Wii U version. I think that's what a lot of these

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
companies are coming to decide that like

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
hey, we're not really making a lot of money on it.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
But, apparently

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
it's going to revolve around Ghost

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
from Modern Warfare 2

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
and they did

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
say that the next gen

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
version of the game is going to

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
have a brand new engine.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Current gen version, sorry, it's going to be running on the same engine

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
that Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
are running on.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
If you want to make that argument, it's the same game each

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
year, go ahead.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
It'll be slightly different.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
I'm looking forward to it.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I've played quite a bit Call of Duty recently.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I think you and a lot of people

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
look forward to it. These games always sell like crazy.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
I don't look for it to be that different, I just look

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
for it to be fun. I mean, that's really it.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
The single player campaign

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
might be cool because now I'm going back and playing through

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
all the single player campaigns from them.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
But as long as the multiplayer is fun,

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
I don't know. I really wish they would just put

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
a multiplayer version of that, only make it

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
maybe half the price or something.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
But then, of course, they'd be cutting out profits.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
That's right. Profits, profits, profits!

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Alright, anyhow, I'm

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
so excited, you guys. It's been forever

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
since we've been able to do a segment like this.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
The way this segment

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
ties to games is really loose, but you

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
know what? We've got to bring in an

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
opportunity to make fun of local news!

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Which I realize is the same as our

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
breaking news theme, or NBC's

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
breaking news theme, but you know what?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
It's all dramatic, all the same.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
So, this is about,

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
and I know so many of you have read about this,

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
this is about a man in New

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Hampshire who was robbed

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
at a carnival game trying to

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
win an Xbox Kinect. That's

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
the only way this ties to video games,

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
that the ultimate prize was an Xbox Kinect.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
But you guys, this story is

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
freaking priceless.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
It's too dumb to be real. It's priceless.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
It makes me think of The Onion.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Courtesy of ABC 40,

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
coming out of, where are they

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
based? Springfield. And Fox

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
6, I guess they're owned by the same people.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
So here you go, courtesy of these guys.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
A clip from the local news.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
I've searched years for the perfect mattress.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I don't care about the perfect mattress.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Mattress Hunter! He searched for

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
the perfect mattress. I didn't say

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
local commercials, I said local news.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Badly animated flash animation.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Alright, here we go.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Henry

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Greboom says he lost his life savings.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
$2600

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
on a carnival game and all he has to show

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
for it is this stuffed banana

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
with dreadlocks.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
What kind of idiot?

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
He has a stuffed banana with

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
dreadlocks. You guys have to see the picture. Let me make a prediction

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
that this banana will go up on

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
eBay with this story and he will make

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
money. Right? And then

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
he's in cahoots with ABC 40.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
We were expecting to win a few things and

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
let the kids have a good time.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
It just didn't turn out that way.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Greboom says he attended a Manchester

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
carnival run by Fiesta shows

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
and wanted to win an Xbox

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Kinect at a game called Tubbs

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
of Fun.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
It's right next to the pinball.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Tubbs of Fun. It's probably not

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
actually Kinect. I'm guessing it's probably

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
an Xbox console with Kinect.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I'm thinking. Because how else

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
could you justify $2600?

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
I mean that's how much you've been thinking.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I'm thinking that he's a little

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
misrepresented. Tubbs of Fun.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Our contestants toss

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
balls into a tub.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
When he practiced he says... Sorry guys.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
It's at max volume so I apologize. This is a little

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
low. Sorry. It was easy.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
But something changed when he started

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
playing for the prize and the balls

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
kept popping out.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
The balls

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
kept popping out.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
It's one of those games. It's clearly that game where you

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
throw the baseball into the little... It's like the angled

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
bucket, right? Kind of ski ball-ish.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Yeah. But I'm sure they switched

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
the ball on you at the last minute or whatever.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
It's not possible that it wasn't rigged.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Greboom says he kept trying

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
to win back his money by going double

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
or nothing. He dropped

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
$300 in just a few minutes.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Why do they have this guy walking

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
down the street pushing his baby in the

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
roller with this giant banana with dreadlocks?

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
That's what cracks me up.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
I want to know why they're giving

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
this fuckwad any attention at all.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Because it's so ridiculous.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Because it's funny.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
It's not funny. It's sad.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
It's like those gambling people, you know?

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
...at $2300 more

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
and soon lost all that as well.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
I know it's a difficult game.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I've tried it myself. I've done it

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
once. Missed probably 20 times.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Fiesta Show says the game is run by an

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
independent contractor who's worked for

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Fiesta for years. It's interviewing

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
the contractor to see what happened.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Queen Simia in our chat room

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
brings up a good point. On the plus side, that's a

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
really big banana. Literally

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
that's what she said.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Are there any scams at all

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
with any of the games? Not that I'm aware of.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
We've had a lot of these game operators

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
with us for years. The Traveling Carnival

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
is now setting up here in Derry,

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
New Hampshire, but you will not see

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Tubbs of Fun.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Because he's taking a vacation because

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
he just made $2300.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
He's like, fuck that. I can skip this next one.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
It's the seriousness of that. You will not see

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Tubbs of Fun or any fun

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
whatsoever.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Is this the Daily Show right now?

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
That's why

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
I thought this was onion-worthy.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
But if

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
I had $2600

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
as my savings

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
and I wanted to buy an

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Xbox. But Jamie, he was just

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
addicted. He had to keep doubling down.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
He had to win that money back. And he's a fucking idiot.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Allegedly.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Allegedly. No, I'm saying it.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
I'm going on record. In my opinion

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
sir, Mr. Banana,

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
you are Tubbs

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
of Stupid. And now he has this

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
giant banana he's got to feed too as well as

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
his children. I mean a banana of that

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
size is going to eat a lot of food.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Donkey Kong is coming for you.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
That's a lot of potassium.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
And maybe listen to a lot of reggae.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
And smoke some stuff.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Independent contractor that runs

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
the game is not allowed to set up

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
while an investigation

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
is taking place. Because you get caught

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
up in the whole double or nothing. I've got to

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
win my money back. Henry says he went back

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Notice something about this shot.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Jamie, I want to point this out to you while this guy is being

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
interviewed. The baby is left

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
alone in the stroller with only the

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
banana to comfort him. And he's

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
struggling to get out.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Did you see what Bobby just linked in chat?

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
No.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
CollegeHumor wants

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
to pay $2600

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
for a giant dreadlock

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
stuffed banana. Of course.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
This guy will end up making a profit

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
off this story. He will sell it on eBay.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Oh my god. And

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
here we are in debt.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
He's just an idiot.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Why would you try? I mean, come on.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
I understand that you may have gotten caught

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
up in the moment, but

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
it's not like you're gambling to win money

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
in a casino. You're gambling to win

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
an object that has a certain value.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
And that value is certainly not

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
$2600. How many people who lose

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
money in casinos do they interview saying

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
men but life savings playing

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
penny slots. Yeah, but you can't

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
win a banana with dreadlocks at a casino.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Yes, you can.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Oh, really, bitch? Yes, you can.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Well, you can get things that are equally

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
as ridiculous. Like, you know, Circus Circus

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
and Excalibur have all those little

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
games in the basement. I want to know.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Hold on, hold on. Raginator in chat says

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
will he get a hammock for that banana?

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
That's a good question. It's big

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
enough. BlackWolf wants to know

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
or BlackWolf suggests we need a giant

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
orange with dreadlocks. Instant

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
money. You know what, Bobby? I can make that for

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
15 bucks. I'll do

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
it, too. Who designs

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
these stuff things like they're

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
like, was it like a dartboard

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
like a dartboard? It says, you know,

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
fruit and the accessory

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
banana

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
dreadlocks, orange

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
cowboy hat. They should

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
freaking hire me. I could just I could design some

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
really disturbing stuff. The Chinese

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
he went back the next day to complain

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
and the man running the game gave

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
him back $600.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
See, that's the crazy. The guy gave him back

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
$600. What carny gives you money

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
back?

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Sorry for you. Yeah, that's where

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
the story gets shady. Why did the carny give

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
him money back? Probably because he's like, I bet

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
my life savings and the guy felt a little bit bad.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
I mean, I mean, how much the guy

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
is just making cash. I mean, he's not losing

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
any. There's nothing to really run this game.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Let's wrap this up and re split with

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
the banana and the cash.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Thank you for working that pun in.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Oh, thank you. I was

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
worried that

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I love you. Local news. He's

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
split with a banana and

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
filed a report with Manchester PD

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
for once in my life. I happen to become

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
that sucker. At least

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
he admits it.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
did.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Did he redeem himself

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
a little bit for at least a minute? No,

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
because he's still stupid. You

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
can admit that you're stupid, but it doesn't change that

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
you're stupid. He admits

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
that you're stupid. He's

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
actually pretty much ruined his

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
whole case because he admitted

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
that he was fooled.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Dear College

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Humor, give me

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
$2600

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
and I will draw you a banana with

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
dreadlocks. I will go find you that banana.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
I'm sure we can purchase it on the internet.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
With $2600, I'll

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
buy a plane ticket to Hong Kong and go find

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
the manufacturer factory and get one.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Let me finish my plea for a job.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Dear College Humor,

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
contract me for $2600 to do nothing

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
but make fun of this guy.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
I promise you I could do it for days on end.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
I would never get tired.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
YYR

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
says that was some hardcore

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
punography.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Punography.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
It would only be if the pun was written.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Let's go to the mailbag.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Let's see what lovely puns await us

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
in the mailbag.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Mailbag at

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
and we pick a few of our favorite emails and read them

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
here on the show. DarkSakura,

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
what do we have tonight?

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
People tripping.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
This one is titled, Damn

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Used Games.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
And this comes from someone with

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
a very unpronounceable name so I'm just going to say

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
read the email.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Hello OLR cast, my name is Zile Scott.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Thank you. You said the name.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
He sold me to.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Put your name in the body of the email.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I'm going to read it.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I was just wondering if any of you guys know of a website

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
that I could print out cover art for used games

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
that have lost their original

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
it's not T-H-E-R-E

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
it's T-H-E-I-R original

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
case.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
I recently bought a shitload of PS1 games

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
and none of them have cover art.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
It makes me sad and annoyed.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Anyway, thanks and keep on with the great work.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Hugs and shit.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
I don't know of any sites per se.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Not even.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Honestly, you know what I do in his position?

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Just go to Google Image Search

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
and search for the game

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Look for large.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
And do large.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Don't blow up a medium size because it will look terrible when you print it out.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Or you can pay me $2600

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
and I will go get all the shit

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
printed for you at King Ghost

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
and it will all be nice.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
You pay me triple that and I'll redraw it all for you.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Honestly, yeah, Google Image Search

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
is what I would use.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Worst case scenario, Amazon.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
That's how you find a lot of missing CD covers.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
But if you don't want it to look shitty

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
look for Hi-Rez.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Queen Simeon in our chatroom says

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
draw your own. Those are the best.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Our Dracula X copy that

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Kristen made us back in the day

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
has her little stick figure

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Richter Belmont

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
with flaily arms

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
and a whip.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
No, you know what this guy needs?

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
This guy needs video game covers

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Comic Sans and clipart.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Have you seen this?

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
That's what you need, sir.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
You need to just forgo the original covers

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
and get Comic Sans and clipart

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
redos, reimaginings

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Do it yourself. It can be a fun project.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
That's right. Why not?

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Make the best out of it.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
For the record, Rob, those make baby Satan cry.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Make baby Satan cry?

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Little fiery tears.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Little tears of lava.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
You want to hear something really crazy?

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
More than one manufacturer of giant bananas

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
with...

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
God, you looked it up.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
It's just seriously strange.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
They seriously have one.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
It's not exactly the same banana.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
It's 150 bucks, by the way.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
It's uglier. 150 bucks?

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Well, that guy got a pretty good deal.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
No, he didn't.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
He got 600 of his bucks back

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
and then $150.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
He only lost two thirds of his money.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
For a carnival, that's not bad.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
And he had

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
tubs of fun, people.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Tubs of fun.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
For the record, I need to find those covers that

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Krista drew me back in the day and scan them in

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
because they're freaking hilarious.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Especially the one for Emerald Dragon that was pretty funny, too.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says,

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Someone who missed out on the Nino Cooney Wizards book

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
made his own. That was awesome.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
But you can still hire me and I will be

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
more than happy to lay out anything you want me to.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Let it go. Get to the next email.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Hey, I've actually got a job option.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
You know what?

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
You know what? Just print your own bananas with dreadlocks

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
for the cover. Final Fantasy 7,

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
banana with dreadlocks. Actually, banana

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
with spiky mohawk for Final Fantasy 7.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
I predict this year. It has me crying.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
This year, instead of

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
space ponchos, it's all about bananas with dreadlocks.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
That is going to be the new trend.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Bananas with dreadlocks. Why not?

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
You know, actually, I was thinking of applying

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
for the River Cats. Oh, yeah?

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
They have a marketing position open. They do.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
My mom was- It's a full year, full time.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
My mom was telling me to go for an announcer

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
position with them some time ago and I was like,

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
really? Me announcing baseball?

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Do you really see that? It would be hilarious.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
I'm the guy, hit the ball and things happen

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
and somebody just caught it.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Oh my god, y'all. Balls are flying

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
everywhere.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
No.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
The pitcher

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
just hit the batter.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Girl.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Shut up.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Alright, next email, dammit. We only have one

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
more. Hello, O.L.R.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Hi.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
What was that?

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
You went high and I lost my

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
shoes.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
I was being nice to the listeners.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
You said hello, I said hello.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Rab!

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
I've got a question for all the hosts.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
There are many games

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
across all generations that have become

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
known for their final boss fights, such as

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
The Doomsday Zone and Sonic 3

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
and Knuckles or GLaDOS and Portal.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
My question to you is, which final

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
boss fight in a game is your favorite?

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
As for mine, I know you guys

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
don't like the game

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
getting a lot of praise, but I absolutely love

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
the final fight against

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Ganon in The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
From the moment he transforms into

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
the beast that we knew from the previous

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
games in the series, the music sends chills

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
down my spine, as well as the

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
setting of a fallen castle is surrounded

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
in both flames and the crashes

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
of lightning and thunder across the sky,

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
with Zelda's standing watch,

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
sometimes screaming in fear when Link takes

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
a blow from Ganon. If you need your memory

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
refreshed of why I think this fight is so awesome, you can watch

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
it here, not clicking the link, because I know.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Thanks for reading, Ocifer.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
PS, this email has been brought to you

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
by me and my everlasting love of the show

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
hosted by the gingerbread man.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Um, I would say that

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
when I was younger,

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
like, it was probably this

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
battle.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Yes!

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Eat your damn vegetables, you stupid frog!

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Because the war battle

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
was pretty epic at that time.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Like, this music was just like,

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
oh my god, he's gonna kill me!

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
And then you feed him veggies and it's okay.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Uh, otherwise,

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
maybe the Kefka battle in Final Fantasy 6

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
was pretty damn epic. Uh, I

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
honestly, not that

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
the battle itself was epic, but

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
the original Metal Gear on the NES,

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
that whole ending sequence

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
was pretty damn amazing.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Well, you mentioned the Kefka battle.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
It was waiting

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
for Shadow at the end of

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
the game that was, like, the big

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
epic teaser.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Um, honestly,

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
um, I liked Final Fantasy 7's

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
final battle, because it was so fucking

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
easy and I could make a sandwich.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
While the whole thing was on autoplay.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Um, god, there was another one, though,

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
that I, um,

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
I remember being completely happy with the

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
ending, more that I was

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
with the last battle. You know what?

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
I always liked the last fights, the Wily

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
fights in the Mega Man games, because it is the

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
stupidest weapon that you use.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Mega Man 3 used Top Man's weapon, the fuck.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Bubble Man 2, or Bubble Man in Mega Man 2.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Yeah, but Bubble Lead was actually useful.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Yes, it was, but to shoot it, to kill a

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
boss in an empty room,

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
that sucked.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
No, getting Top Man and

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
jumping on top of the Wily floater thing.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
You have to kill him by topping him.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
You have to top his floater.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Um, there was a few,

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
there was. Loki, what about you?

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Epic boss battles, do you remember?

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Um,

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I can't

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
really think of any

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
big boss battles, um,

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
I guess some of the boss battles

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
in Earth Defense Force are pretty epic.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Especially some of the later levels, they were just

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
ridiculous. But, um,

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
I haven't played anything with

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
real big boss battles lately.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Yeah, the Technodrome fight.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Um,

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
God, I remember the first time I beat

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
that game, too. It was, it was actually

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
the day my little brother got hit by a car.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Aww. And so, my

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Grandmom left me and my friend Jennifer at the mall

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
back when it was the old school lands castle

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
that still had carpeted walls.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Before Namco bought it.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Yep. And, uh,

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
These guys

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
gave me money to help them

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
beat the game. They, um, they paid for me to play

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
as Leonardo, because that was the only slot open.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
And we had just beaten the game, and the thing

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
was just starting, and they turned off all the machines

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
because it was time to go. I know, I know.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
I know one epic boss battle.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
I got my revenge because I got to do the same thing.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Max 300 is pretty epic

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
getting to that. Yeah.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
I can, you know, I can consider that, or, um,

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
shoot.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
The Legend of Max? No, um,

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Robo Z.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
In, uh, Bust a Move.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Because remember that, you're

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
going through the game, and everybody's your size

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
and everything.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Pull up, pull up, fly into your soul.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Real quick.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
And for anyone who, um,

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
hasn't played the game, like, um,

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
uh, Bust a Move,

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
uh,

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
that came out in the US, and, um,

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
in the US, it was Bust a Groove.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
In Japan, it was Bust a Move.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
You can hear this music start.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
And you're on a building,

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
you're this little teeny tiny thing

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
with a robot, like,

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
this bigger than the building.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Like, twice the size of the building.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
It was epic. You have cars running

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
off the edges, and all this

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
shit, and, oh my god,

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
that was the best game.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Alright. Good email.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Thank you.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I'm actually gonna say that Robo Z

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
is my

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
number one favorite boss battle.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Number one favorite boss battle.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Alright, uh, if that's it for emails,

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
if you want to get in on a future email

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
bag segment. Uh, let us

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
get to the FUs of the week.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
It's the part of the show where we get angsty.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Why? Um,

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
I don't know.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
...

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
...

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
...

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
...

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
...

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
...

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
...

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
I have two. The first one goes

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
towards me. I think I'm fighting off something.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
So I'm just probably gonna take it easy tomorrow.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Um, cause,

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
well, I think that I'm just a little worn

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
down because I've maybe gotten

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
five hours of sleep, uh, last night and the

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
night before and then went to the baseball game yesterday

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
and was up all night and it was a new stuff.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
And, actually I have three.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
It turns out that my wheat and corn allergy

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
is a lot worse than I thought.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Which, the only reason I eat anything wheat

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
today is because I took plenty of Enidril before the show.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
But I think that it's

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
definitely gonna have to get cut out altogether

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
and I keep pushing it and

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
I'm just happier without it, you know.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
It hasn't stopped me from having ice cream.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
I can have ice cream as long as I don't have cookies

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
in my ice cream. So.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
The cookies are good though.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Rob, I can get gluten free cookies.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
There you go.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
And, um, the other one, uh,

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
goes towards

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
there not being an actual third

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Bust-A-Move game.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
And not counting Dance Summit.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
I'm not counting Dance Summit.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
We need an actual new Bust-A-Move game.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Dear Squeenix,

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Dear Squa part of Enix,

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
when you absorbed the

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Enix to become the conglomerate of

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Squeenix, you also inherited

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
the Bust-A-Move series.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Do something with it!

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
The end.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Um, Frisbee.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Have you ever been headbutted by your son?

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Um, yes, but that was in my head.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Um,

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
Becky was telling me about when Julian

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
was like two, he would run in while

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Chris was playing Xbox games and headbutt him

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
in the crotch. Nice.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
He was an accident. He doesn't know how to

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
throw a Frisbee correctly yet, so

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
he threw it behind him. You'll learn him.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
He was a good kid.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
My FU of the Week goes to the

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
fact that Alan made all these french fries

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
before the show and I ate them all

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
and this is why I'm bad.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Bad.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
But they were so good.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Two more stories, then we're gonna open up the

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Two more stories, Loki.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
So, um, they announced a brand new

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
exclusive game coming to the Ouya.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
It's, um, being done by

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
KimSwift and Airtight Games

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
who did Quantum Conundrum.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
It's called Soulfjord.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
It's a cross between

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
70's Funk and Norse Mythology.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
And it's got a guy named Magnus Jones

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
who is like a viking with an afro.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
I don't know, it looks cute. It's like a beaten up game.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Is it something I'm gonna be picking up? I don't know.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
But it's supposed to be, uh,

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
coming, I guess, uh,

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
soon.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Not sure it's coming. Like most things, soon.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Yeah.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
One more story for you guys, and this is about a very

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
interesting, uh, demake

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
of a game. And this

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
kind of blows my mind, actually.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Um, you know, in China

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
they tend to do this bootleg

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
software. Uh, and a lot of times

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
it's current titles that they cram into

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
these 8-bit carts, and usually they're hacks

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
or things like that. Like, we've seen Tekken, the

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
8-bit version, and all this crazy shit, right?

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
The RPG. Yeah, right? Like, all this crazy

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
shit, right? Well, here's an interesting one

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
they did recently. They demaked

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Final Fantasy 4. What?

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Yes, Super Nintendo Final Fantasy 4.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
They demade it

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
for the Famicom.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
God dammit.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Don't

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
play the smoking commercial. Trickyotomyman!

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
I don't know what, that always

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
made me think of Dennis Leary. God dammit,

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
I just wanted to see the stupid

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
demake, and I got a stupid commercial instead.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
And I want meat from only cows that smoke.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Okay, am I gonna get the commercial again, or am I gonna get the game?

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
Alright. I'm Bill.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
I've had diabetes since I was a little kid.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
I was a diabetes guy!

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
When I turn the volume all the way down,

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
it doesn't shut them up. That's annoying.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
So, sorry, I guess I can't play the music for you guys.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Adblock, adblock. But it's very...

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
I'm trying not to use

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Adblock, because I'm supporting my favorite internet

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
websites. You can whitelist

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
your favorite internet websites. Well, I'm gonna blacklist

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
those sons of bitches, but anyway,

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
because if I can't turn the volume down,

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
anyway, it's

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
got, the soundtrack

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
has been shoved into the 8-bit cartridges

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
very well, which is really amazing,

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
and the, for 8-bit,

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
it looks pretty good, I gotta say.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
They've spread it across three

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
cartridges, though, because, you know, Super Nintendo

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
versus Nintendo, they have the

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
light game, the dark game, and

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
the, I don't know, the end game, or something

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
like that, and because

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
you can't transfer saves from one

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
to the other, it basically recaps

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
the story when you start one of the, and

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
starts your characters at an appropriate level.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
You can play them in any order you want. It's just

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
fascinating that somebody did a lot of

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
work to do that for the Famicom.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Cool. Imagine if they had focused themselves

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
onto, like, making an

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
original game. I know, right?

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
So there you go. Who does original

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
things anymore? Please.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
This show's not even

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
original anymore. What the lump.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Alright. Now I can't get that image

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
of the chick with the tracheotomy out of my head. God

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
damn you. You know what? I can't get

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Dennis Leary's voice out of my head now.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Cow's the

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
smoke. Had tracheotomies.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
We're

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAMELR

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
or our username on Skype, Orange

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Lounge Radio, all one word, if you want to give us

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
a call, and we can talk about

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
whatever. You want to talk about demakes, you want to talk about

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
remakes, you want to talk about anything we've talked

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
about tonight, or something else,

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
give us a call. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
on Skype, or 1-877-GAMELR.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
In the meantime, I've got some tweets

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
I want to read for you guys.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Tigerclaw sent us a few tweets at

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
twitter.com slash O-L-R. First

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
tweet, Sony Korea

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
restricts PlayStation Network to 18

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
plus. You guys hear about this?

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
The Korea PlayStation

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Network has been down for like 8 or

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
9 months, and it just

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
recently reopened.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
This is because of a law in South

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Korea that will

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
keep teens under the age of 16 from

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
playing games during a 6 hour block at

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
night.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Anyhow, let's go to the phones.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
It's ringing.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
It's the one and only Ranma. Hey, Ranma.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
How you doing?

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
I'm good, I'm good.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Did you know that smoking is bad for you?

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
Why, yes it is. That's why I

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
smoke other things, but that's not why I call.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
An endorsement from Mr. Spanky.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Why did you call?

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Put the coffee on.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
You gotta talk.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I'll get the cheesecake.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Fabulous, darlin'. Fabulous.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
What is up? What do you want to talk about?

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Okay, I'm coming home on the train, and I

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
tune in right about time with you. Loki's talking about

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
piracy and everything, and

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
I

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
understand both sides of this,

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
because even in my world that I

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
cover, we have to deal with entitlement

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
kids who feel that they shouldn't have to pay for

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
anything because it's quote unquote free

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
and available, but when those series

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
are licensed, they don't want to pony

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
up the twenty or thirty bucks to buy

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
the entire series. And of course you're talking

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
about anime. Yes.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
It's coming to another point, it's a financial

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
aspect because

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
truth be told, I don't, it's just me.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Nobody wants to drop three and four hundred

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
dollars on a new console,

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
knowing that the games are going to be

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
fifty, sixty, and seventy

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
dollars. So if there's a way to pirate

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
it, so be it.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
And even if the game is like

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
five, six dollars, people are still

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
going to pirate it because that's five, six dollars

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
that they're going to keep and put towards something else.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Yeah, but the question is

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
if they were to put out a game, let's say

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
a game like, I don't know, Tomb Raider

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
since Jamie brought it up earlier in the show,

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
she got it on sale. If they were to

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
release Tomb Raider for five bucks,

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
you'd probably have a whole lot of

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
people jumping on that, but would it be

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
twelve times the amount of people

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
that would have bought it for sixty bucks?

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
I think more people would have bought it

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
at five bucks and at sixty.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
That's what it's coming down to. More? But would it be

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
twelve times as many? Because that's how many,

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
it's got to be more than twelve times as many.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
I really think it is because it's coming down

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
to where you got to be cost

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
consensus. I mean,

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
most, almost every single

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
PS3 360

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
game I own, I paid

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
anywhere between twenty and forty bucks.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
One or two, I paid retail

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
price only because

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
it was a game that I wanted or I got a gift

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
card for it, done and done.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
And as for,

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
you know, releasing the game on the

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Pirate Bay, free like that,

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
see, there's one thing

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
about that, if

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
you see this game,

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
you're going to check the comments

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
within the first five or six comments,

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
somebody's going to be like, oh,

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
this game has a hack in it,

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
don't download, don't download, don't download.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Then you're going to go,

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
find another torrent where it's the full

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
game and you're going to grab that.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Well, what I

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
understand about this particular story

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
though is that the author

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
put it up and it was downloaded so many times so fast,

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
you don't figure out

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
what's going on until you've played the game for a

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
little bit. True.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Let's say, you know, like within an hour or

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
so, people are going to go back to that torrent and be like,

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
oh, don't download because

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
Yeah, but in an hour it's been downloaded five

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
thousand times already. And the sad part is

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
that that torrent is still going, but

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
if you're smart, you're going to stop that and just jump

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
onto something else. Right, right.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
So, all

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
right, well, anything else you want to share with listeners

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
tonight?

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
No, not really.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
I'm good. I just want to get

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
that off my chest and agree with y'all about this whole

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
piracy thing and

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
Where

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
can I come give you a hug at an anime

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
convention coming up soon?

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Are you going to any anime conventions in the next

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
couple weeks? I will be kidnapping

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
the entire staff, putting them in

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
a Snakes box and dragging them to

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
anime next in June. Awesome.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
I wish you were coming to Fanime. It would give

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
me a reason to go. I

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
know, but I have my own personal reasons

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
that I'm taking time off for the

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
sponsor. I know, I understand.

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
VXJ Snakes V is going to be there, so

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
I'm still

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
unpacking the shoebox studio, okay?

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
All right, fair enough, fair enough.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
She'll do it anyway. All right.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Well, take care, Rama. Thanks for the call.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
You got it, bro. All right, later.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
1877 Game O L R, our username

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Also from

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Tigerclaw, another tweet about Zone of the

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Ender sequel on hold. The team

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
was disbanded due

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
to issues with the HD remake.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Did the zone get ended?

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Yes, it was.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Oh, boy.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
This is actually from Hideo Kojima himself

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
on Hideo Blog, the radio show

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
that he does online, his little podcast.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
The proposed sequel

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
in Zone of the Enders was ceased,

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
and this was because the HD

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
collection issues were the reasons

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
behind the stop in development. I guess this

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
doesn't mean that it can't come back

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
later, but for right now,

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
nope.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Bummer.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Again, 1877

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Game O L R, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
All one word.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Sj100matt tweeted

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
us something about Grant Kirkhope,

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
who's the composer of Perfect Dark,

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
and Banjo-Kazooie, I thought you mentioned this

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
earlier, offering their soundtracks up for

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Pay Issue 1. Didn't we have that Perfect Dark story earlier?

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Or did we

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
skip it tonight? Oh, I guess I didn't

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
show all that after all. Well, I was gonna cover

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
this, but apparently not. So you can check this

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
out, grantkirkhope.bandcamp.com

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
payissue1 for Perfect Dark

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
and Banjo-Kazooie. So if you,

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Perfect Dark had a pretty good

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
soundtrack, at least, I know. I didn't play

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
a lot of Banjo-Kazooie, but I've played

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
a lot of Perfect Dark on 360.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
With Sj100matt,

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
when he had this little trolling device that worked.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Redertainment wants to know

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
on Twitter, is there a reason the Christian right

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
hasn't flipped their shit about the various

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
religious comments in Bioshock Infinite?

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Well, the

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Westboro Baptist Church is getting ready to

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
protest that Slayer guy's funeral,

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
so that's probably what they're preoccupied

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
with doing. Which, by the way,

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
what a stupid idea.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
What a stupid idea.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Well, I guess I should take a step back even

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
further. How unfortunate

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
that that guy passed away and what sounds like

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
what's really like a freak thing. Like,

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
you first hear that the guy dies of liver

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
failure and he can't help but think,

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
oh yeah, rock and roll lifestyle, right? Liver failure.

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
But it turns out he may have got like a spider bite

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
a couple years ago that led to this

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
because he didn't get a treat. Like, it's crazy stuff.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
I don't know if you guys have read about it. Very sad stuff.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Obviously Slayer has these hardcore

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
fans that will carve the name

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
of the band into their various

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
pieces of flesh, and the

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
Westboro Baptist Church is

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
gonna go protest this guy's funeral.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Good

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
luck. You'll need it.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Ah, it's gonna be violent.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
But nobody's gonna care.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
That's gonna be the hilarious part.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
So, um,

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
yeah, so screw the Westboro

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Baptist Church. But anyway, back to the question that was really asked

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
by Redertainment. Is there a reason the Christian

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
right hasn't flipped their shit about the various

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
religious comments of Bioshock Infinite?

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Bigger fish to fry right now? What do you think,

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Loki? You've played Bioshock Infinite.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Why hasn't the religious right started complaining yet?

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
I don't know why they would complain about it.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
I mean, it's just, it's fictional. I don't

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
really think it's gonna be,

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
I don't know. It's

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
not necessarily like saying religion's bad.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
It's just they're extreme

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
in the scenarios of the game.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
So, I don't know.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
I don't know why they

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
would waste their time on that. I mean, they're not PETA.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
I mean, I guess, you know, if animals are

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
getting hurt or something like that, then maybe, you know,

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
they'd come after them.

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
You know, for example, if that horse scene was still

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
there, maybe they would come after them.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
I just, I just don't

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
think they care. Or they're aware of it. You know, they'll bring it

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
up later on. You know, like how they,

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
how those gun makers or whatever really

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
get pissed off at, oh, that postal game.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
It's making people violent.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Yeah, wait, wait about ten years

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
and then they'll finally catch up and start complaining about it.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
No Shock Infinite games. Like, what?

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
They're just now getting around, you know, Super Mario World.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Grand Theft Auto 3

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
is so violent.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Alright, I think that was it for

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Twitter topics tonight. So, um,

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
actually, wait, I want to go back. I thought I saw stuff earlier

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
in the week. Let me go,

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
let me go to Loki and ask if

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
you have any last minute stories

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
first. There is a fan made

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Duke Nukem Forever mod

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
being released for Duke Nukem 3D.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
It's based off the original footage from

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
the 2001 E3 trailer.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
And, uh,

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
you can download it for free

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
on moddb.com

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
slash mod slash duke

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
dash nukem dash forever.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
And you just need a copy of

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Duke Nukem 3D.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Can you play that on Steam yet?

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
multiplayer?

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
You can download it.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
I'm waiting for that. I found the tweets

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
that I was looking for that I knew would come earlier

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
in the week. What are the tweets you're looking for?

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Oh, there are all the tweets I'm looking for.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
YYR tweeted us earlier in the week.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Now I'm drawing comparisons between the Wii U

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
and Dreamcast in my head.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Might make an interesting conversation topic for

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
OLR. Both were released way

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
ahead of the competition and had difficulty

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
garnering third-party support. But

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
compared to its eventual competition,

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Dreamcast held up better muscle-wise

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
being comparable or even favorable

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
to PS2 in some ways.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Um, too soon to tell.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
I get the comparisons with the whole fact that

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
but didn't they also not make Madden on the

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Dreamcast or one of the big sports games didn't

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
didn't make its way over there. And that was

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
kind of the beginning of the end. But I think there was

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
a lot of other stuff that came into play too.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
I don't even think it's necessarily comparable because

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
you know, spec-wise, I don't think

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
it's comparable at all with the next gen system.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
I think it's more like the current gen stuff.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
It's just kind of an in-between thing.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
And yeah, it's their next

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
generation of that console.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
But I wouldn't compare it to the next

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
gen gaming systems.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
You're not going to be able to do what they do

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
on those systems on that system.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Well, last call for calls.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
1877 Game O-L-R

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
Loki, anything else?

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Mega Man Limited looks

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
cool. They got a new trailer for it. It's

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
another fan-made game.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Maybe it'll get

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
shut down by Capcom.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
Earthbound 4

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
apparently having a fan game.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
The creator

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
said on Twitter this week, I want to say

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
I'm not doing it. Not happening.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
Very difficult to happen, so

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
I kind of think you should never say

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
never, but

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
getting more games in the Mother

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
series. I guess I should say Earthbound 4.

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
It's technically Mother 4. Sorry. Sorry, Piras.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
But Mother 4.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
There you go. He could very well just put out an Earthbound game.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
Exactly.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Gotcha!

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
I didn't see anything about Earthbound.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
So.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Alright, well

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
I guess no other calls tonight.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Y'all have been shy lately. We barely got

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
any calls last week either.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
What's up with that? It's the show where every gamer

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
has a voice if you use it.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
Alright, I'll shut down

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
the Skype line for now. If you think of something later, you want

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
to send us your thoughts. Mailbag

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or of course there's always Twitter.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
We're afraid of the banana. We might stick a banana

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
with dreadlocks on them? Yeah. Well, I'm hoping the Skype

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
connection works. Maybe something's wrong there. I should've

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
tested it, but. Alright, anyhow.

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Well, Rama got through it, so I know at least

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
one of it's working. Anything else,

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Loki, you want to get out?

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Nope. No?

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Then I guess that brings us to the end of the show.

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
I guess so.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
A little earlier than usual

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
tonight, but it's only supposed to be about a three hour show

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
with a break included, so that's alright.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
I want to thank you guys for

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
tuning out tonight, or tuning out

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
turning out tonight and tuning in. You're welcome.

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Now you can tune out.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Thank you guys very much for

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
tuning into the show and supporting our show.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
If you like what you hear, don't forget to

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
support independent radio. You know, there's a lot of people

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
out there making podcasts

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
just because they have voices

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
they want to use and just trying to make

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
a name for themselves and they're not asking

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
for $35,000 of your money to make it happen.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Support indie podcasting

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
and help the community grow.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
And if you want to help our podcast grow,

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
tell a friend or two about the show.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Leave a nice review on iTunes. Thumbs up on

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Stitcher and listening time on there really

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
helps go a long way as well. Really, really

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
appreciate it. Before we close up shop tonight,

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
DarkSakura, we'll start with you. Your final thought.

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Exclamation point. Loki, your final

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
thought tonight. Final thought is

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
I have a lot of

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
money to spend on Amazon soon

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
and I don't know what to get.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
My final thought is I should have

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
made you buy me that IK that I spent $40

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
on this weekend. Fuck that, it's an IK.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Speaking of what IK, what they should do

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
is actually come out with some sort of pinball

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
version of it, you know, with Jesus Christ pinball

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
and have the flippers and stuff and have

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
a pinball game that supports it. Now you're talking

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
my language, yes sir. Love it.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
I bet there's a pinball game that

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
supports IK though.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
I would just go with PinMame and leave it at that, but

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Why not? I'm surprised they don't have like

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
PinMame on the iPad somehow

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
even though, you know, the Apple

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Gustavo locks everything down.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
There is the whole

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
what is it just called pinball arcade?

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
I don't know, I've got it on here.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
Yeah, pinball arcade, which is pretty good.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
If it had IK'd support it would be awesome.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Be nice. Alright.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Well that's it guys.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
We're done.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
That's another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Thanks you guys. We'll be back to do it again

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
next week. Episode 504.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
I'm hoping we'll have an interview next week so stay

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
tuned to Twitter. I'll tell you more about that as soon

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
as I have that confirmed for this week.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
In the meantime, have fun gaming.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
Thursday night, Forza Horizon, right?

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Forza Horizon at 8 PM Pacific Standard Time.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
And Mass Effect 3 at 5?

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
30? Thursday?

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
All three of us broadcasting

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
throughout the week, so

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
tune into our channels and

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
check that out. Have a great week

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
everybody. We'll see you next time with

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
more of Orange Launch Radio. Good night.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
You've been listening to Orange

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
Lounge Radio.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Orange Lounge Radio is a production

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
of OLR Studios.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
To join us for a live

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
show, tune into

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
VoGnetwork.com, Sunday nights

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
at 6 PM Pacific,

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
9 PM Eastern.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
The views and opinions expressed

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
in this program do not necessarily

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
reflect those of the staff

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
of Orange Lounge Radio or

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
VoGnetwork, but you know

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
they were all still true.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
See you next week.

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Thanks for watching.
