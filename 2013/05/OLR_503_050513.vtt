00:14.184 --> 00:18.971
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, May 5th, 2013, one Wii U game finally goes free to play in the U.S.

00:19.091 --> 00:20.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Could more be coming?

00:20.353 --> 00:26.461
[SPEAKER_02]: The creators of Nyan Cat sue one video game maker, and could Respawn's next game be an Xbox exclusive?

00:31.826 --> 00:37.270
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.330 --> 00:45.296
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number 503 for May the 5th of 2013.

00:45.397 --> 00:47.738
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Cinco de Mayo to you guys.

00:48.259 --> 00:53.223
[SPEAKER_08]: And on behalf of all Americans, I'd like to apologize to Mexico for Chevys.

00:54.003 --> 00:55.885
[SPEAKER_08]: Because what is, seriously, what is Chevys?

00:56.345 --> 00:56.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Delicious!

00:57.846 --> 00:59.988
[SPEAKER_03]: They have like the salad that I freaking like.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.690
[SPEAKER_03]: and that corn stuff that I'm allergic to, I freaking love.

01:02.870 --> 01:05.032
[SPEAKER_03]: So you shut your whore mouth.

01:05.513 --> 01:08.055
[SPEAKER_08]: The voice of reason over there telling me to shut my whore mouth.

01:08.175 --> 01:10.597
[SPEAKER_08]: The one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:10.978 --> 01:12.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's mouth is a dirty whore.

01:13.580 --> 01:20.526
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people can take that a lot of different ways and I don't appreciate you slandering me on this program.

01:20.566 --> 01:22.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mouth is a freshly brushed whore.

01:23.629 --> 01:24.830
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that even supposed to mean?

01:24.850 --> 01:25.570
[SPEAKER_03]: It means it's clean.

01:25.590 --> 01:26.131
[SPEAKER_03]: You brush your teeth.

01:27.435 --> 01:31.759
[SPEAKER_06]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, who I will not call names for one minute.

01:31.919 --> 01:38.264
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Reggie has sent you a secret Cinco de Mayo message because apparently your Wii is glowing.

01:38.745 --> 01:42.308
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that Wii has been glowing for like two weeks.

01:42.668 --> 01:44.630
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually, not even that, about a week.

01:44.850 --> 01:55.599
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, my honest reaction when that thing started glowing blue, and I already know what the message is thanks to a news story coming up later, but when it started glowing blue, my honest reaction was, it was plugged in?

01:57.881 --> 01:59.623
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God, I was like, the Wii was plugged in.

01:59.783 --> 02:01.345
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I unplugged it after I moved all that.

02:01.365 --> 02:03.887
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because there's literally nothing left on my Wii.

02:04.368 --> 02:09.153
[SPEAKER_08]: I did the little Pikmin transfer thing to my Wii U because I wanted the discount on the virtual console games.

02:09.513 --> 02:13.697
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's no reason for me to have the Wii except to use what?

02:13.758 --> 02:14.658
[SPEAKER_08]: Forecast Channel?

02:15.319 --> 02:18.542
[SPEAKER_08]: and Spin the Globe and see what the weather's like in South Pole.

02:18.762 --> 02:20.684
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in June, they're pulling the plug on that.

02:20.964 --> 02:29.451
[SPEAKER_08]: So I won't even be able to see what the weather's like in the South Pole anymore unless I actually pull up an internet web browser and look at weather.com or whatever.

02:29.471 --> 02:31.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, what do you have that I have in my hand right now?

02:32.153 --> 02:32.934
[SPEAKER_03]: You have an iPhone.

02:32.954 --> 02:33.515
[SPEAKER_03]: A microphone.

02:34.656 --> 02:34.976
[SPEAKER_03]: Bite me.

02:35.316 --> 02:41.942
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is just put in Antarctica on your phone and hold on.

02:44.870 --> 02:49.553
[SPEAKER_03]: Siri, you whore, what is the temperature in Antarctica?

02:51.354 --> 02:52.274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna see if Siri will answer.

02:52.915 --> 02:54.336
[SPEAKER_03]: God, fucking Siri.

02:54.516 --> 02:56.897
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, how great, yeah, how fucking wonderful.

02:57.297 --> 02:57.417
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

02:57.938 --> 02:59.819
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't find things in Antarctica.

02:59.999 --> 03:01.300
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you be more specific?

03:01.840 --> 03:02.681
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha!

03:02.721 --> 03:03.421
[SPEAKER_08]: You bitch.

03:03.581 --> 03:06.003
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that awesome device you have in your hand.

03:06.343 --> 03:08.344
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, technology, so great, isn't it?

03:12.523 --> 03:13.943
[SPEAKER_08]: The joys of live radio.

03:14.183 --> 03:15.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no one can see me flip off, Rob.

03:15.804 --> 03:24.106
[SPEAKER_08]: Also say hello to our live audience and the ever-present fourth guest on our program, the chatterers, live.vognetwork.com.

03:24.426 --> 03:31.347
[SPEAKER_08]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

03:31.727 --> 03:34.048
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, that's live.vognetwork.com.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.729
[SPEAKER_08]: Misty started us off tonight saying, fucking Siri indeed.

03:37.969 --> 03:38.109
[SPEAKER_08]: See?

03:39.589 --> 03:56.823
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go, all the VOG listeners hate Siri, confirmed Oh, I feel so bad for True, having your first car be an 84 Mustang, which is like one of the worst years for Mustangs TigerClaw on chat says, did you see this week's SNL's weekend update when they made fun of Google Glasses?

03:58.244 --> 03:59.885
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think about that whole Google Glasses thing?

04:00.586 --> 04:04.169
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's too expensive Yeah, do we know the price on those yet?

04:04.551 --> 04:07.514
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna record everything I do Okay, we'll give you one for free

04:32.901 --> 04:35.703
[SPEAKER_08]: VXJSXV in chat says, Rob Roberts, you skipped Loki?

04:35.783 --> 04:36.183
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't.

04:36.264 --> 04:37.645
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I would not make fun of him for a while.

04:37.665 --> 04:39.686
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when I talked about the glowing light on the Wii?

04:39.806 --> 04:40.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Where were you?

04:40.967 --> 04:46.572
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, remember, Colorado did just recently legalize a little something something.

04:46.672 --> 04:47.112
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

04:47.152 --> 04:48.113
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Jason's not into that.

04:49.033 --> 04:49.394
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

04:50.614 --> 04:51.575
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the other comment?

04:51.615 --> 04:55.297
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, SSJ100Matt says, Jamie just wishes Siri was more like Edie.

04:55.697 --> 04:56.238
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I do not.

04:56.278 --> 04:56.618
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

04:57.018 --> 04:57.618
[SPEAKER_08]: True facts.

04:57.819 --> 04:58.719
[SPEAKER_08]: She might not be Joker.

04:58.819 --> 05:05.863
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the Seth Green voice for my phone because that would be really... Actually, no, I want GLaDOS for my phone so that I can get directions while I'm being berated.

05:07.444 --> 05:09.345
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't you get like a GLaDOS GPS thing?

05:09.485 --> 05:10.686
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I saw that somewhere.

05:10.706 --> 05:11.486
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what else they have?

05:11.506 --> 05:20.131
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a Spongebob one and I went to a pinball event and the guy had one and I was like make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.

05:21.906 --> 05:22.126
[SPEAKER_08]: Number 1, 1226

05:38.413 --> 05:39.033
[SPEAKER_08]: 63,000 people backed it.

05:39.053 --> 05:40.574
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of them backed it with getting a console.

05:40.614 --> 05:42.175
[SPEAKER_08]: So you were still one of the first few.

05:42.215 --> 05:43.275
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was the first day.

05:54.901 --> 05:58.083
[SPEAKER_08]: So you finally got your Ouya after waiting a couple weeks.

05:59.064 --> 06:00.745
[SPEAKER_06]: It took like a month.

06:00.765 --> 06:01.886
[SPEAKER_06]: They sent me a ship.

06:01.926 --> 06:06.950
[SPEAKER_06]: It was going to ship back in April.

06:06.970 --> 06:07.310
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

06:07.330 --> 06:08.651
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the second week of April or something.

06:09.111 --> 06:10.352
[SPEAKER_06]: And it took like two weeks to get here.

06:11.721 --> 06:12.141
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

06:28.267 --> 06:35.436
[SPEAKER_06]: We were still playing games over in our game room, which is basically an empty half of a building that we don't use anymore.

06:35.937 --> 06:40.102
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just me over there when I go to play games.

06:40.382 --> 06:46.129
[SPEAKER_06]: So I used two office chairs with that box and an Xbox 360 controller and leaned my phone against it.

06:46.670 --> 06:49.374
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take a picture of it in comparison to the coffee cup.

07:04.594 --> 07:06.575
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's about the size of the coffee cup.

07:06.655 --> 07:07.435
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the coffee cup is bigger.

07:07.455 --> 07:08.255
[SPEAKER_03]: The coffee cup is bigger.

07:08.635 --> 07:10.175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put my iPad behind it.

07:10.396 --> 07:15.557
[SPEAKER_08]: Which shows you the priorities of our caffeine intake here at OLR.

07:15.937 --> 07:19.438
[SPEAKER_08]: So DarkSakura is going to take a picture for OrangeLunchRadio.com right now.

07:19.458 --> 07:20.878
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that go to Tumblr too when you do that?

07:21.838 --> 07:22.339
[SPEAKER_08]: It can.

07:22.359 --> 07:22.499
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

07:24.284 --> 07:31.672
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I got it and I did the firmware update that they had on there and started downloading games.

07:31.692 --> 07:38.600
[SPEAKER_06]: And then one of the first few days I started trying to sideload stuff because I wanted to see what exactly you could sideload on it.

07:39.200 --> 07:45.047
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weird because they don't really have a way to root it, although you're supposed to be able to root it straight out of the box and be able to do everything with it.

07:45.407 --> 07:46.288
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

08:00.427 --> 08:01.108
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

08:18.932 --> 08:22.714
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once you've done that, you set up your Wi-Fi.

08:22.754 --> 08:35.723
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have it hooked up to the Ethernet, so you set up your Wi-Fi, and then you either create an account or you log into an existing account with OUYA if you need to have it or not.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.966
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had an account already, so I logged into mine, and that's it.

08:40.206 --> 08:41.067
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're greeted.

08:41.127 --> 08:47.391
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I had to do a system update after that, so you do a system update, and then you go back to the main menu.

08:48.031 --> 08:50.153
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have like four menu options you get to choose from.

08:50.173 --> 08:51.574
[SPEAKER_06]: They have one that's basically settings.

08:52.455 --> 08:54.657
[SPEAKER_06]: They call them all different things like manage or something.

08:55.978 --> 09:06.206
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a section that's make, which is basically all the sideloaded stuff for where if you're developing a game for OUYA, that's where you would dump your APKs and stuff and where you'd be able to play that stuff.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.668
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's discover, which is their store.

09:10.749 --> 09:11.450
[SPEAKER_06]: They have that.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.732
[SPEAKER_06]: And then play, which is going to be all your games.

09:14.252 --> 09:16.274
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went to the store and just downloaded like...

09:16.974 --> 09:17.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything.

09:19.016 --> 09:19.697
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I could.

09:20.618 --> 09:24.482
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some stuff that I wanted to play since I'd seen video of it.

09:25.162 --> 09:31.048
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my first downloads was No Breaks of LA because I was like, this looked hilarious on the video when I saw it.

09:31.248 --> 09:32.830
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's pretty hilarious.

09:33.010 --> 09:34.912
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the Final Fantasy 3 on there yet?

09:35.112 --> 09:35.952
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Final Fantasy 3.

09:35.992 --> 09:36.813
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the demo for it.

09:37.273 --> 09:38.374
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm paying $15 for that.

09:38.655 --> 09:39.956
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just curious.

09:40.016 --> 09:41.457
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing, too.

09:41.657 --> 09:44.699
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything I've downloaded so far, I've not had to put any of my credit card information in yet.

09:44.819 --> 09:45.180
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.662
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't have to put it in until you want to actually buy something.

09:47.682 --> 09:55.648
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they changed that, too, in one of their very first... Remember, they had the whole rabble-rabble on the internet about that, and it changed pretty quick.

09:55.828 --> 10:02.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you can go in and change that stuff, and I think you can even remove it at any time or something.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.058
[SPEAKER_08]: So what about the hack-in and all this?

10:04.198 --> 10:06.063
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be this whole open thing.

10:06.223 --> 10:08.348
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get in there and try to figure out?

10:08.509 --> 10:11.015
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the first question I asked you was, did you get the emulators working?

10:11.624 --> 10:12.885
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, yeah, I have the emulator.

10:12.946 --> 10:21.915
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I have, I wasn't really, because of my, it's, it's emulators, so I haven't really bothered to, like, okay, I know what Mario Kart 64 looks like, you know, I'm not, I'm not in a huge hurry to put that on there yet.

10:21.935 --> 10:24.478
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but sometimes, sometimes the emulators can be a little crappy.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I do, well, I do want to play with it.

10:26.200 --> 10:32.687
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, it's, like, they have G, GSNES, which I, I recognize that as, like, you know, PC thing, and then

10:33.067 --> 10:36.150
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, I think, SNES 9X on there.

10:38.572 --> 10:40.714
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what the Nintendo 64 one was.

10:40.814 --> 10:47.140
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they just added one for the DS, which I don't know how the hell that would work, but I guess it will.

10:47.660 --> 10:49.302
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else?

10:50.563 --> 10:52.364
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other cool things I found out about it.

10:52.845 --> 10:56.208
[SPEAKER_06]: You can sync Xbox 360 controllers and PlayStation 3 controllers to it.

10:56.568 --> 10:56.908
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.571
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I have not gotten that to work correctly.

11:00.251 --> 11:04.055
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed the Ouya controller, you were letting me kind of get a feel for it.

11:04.295 --> 11:04.976
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that bad.

11:04.996 --> 11:05.376
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad.

11:05.396 --> 11:09.360
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that bothers me a slight little bit is just the shoulder buttons.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.722
[SPEAKER_06]: The shoulder buttons just kind of feel weird because they're big and fat.

11:12.442 --> 11:36.731
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I'm just it's a little strange to me but you know they work so I don't know it'll be all right but all the like the directional buttons and like I'm not even really you know big deal about the letters being different on there it doesn't you know they're the same colors as the Xbox 360 stuff so I just go by color anyway so I'm like okay I mean you you pick it up in like a second and that's it it's

11:37.031 --> 11:37.271
[SPEAKER_06]: PS3, PS4, PS5

11:53.471 --> 11:55.573
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't get both of them synced.

11:55.613 --> 11:57.034
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

11:57.054 --> 12:01.478
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when I try to sync a PS3 controller to it, my Ouya controller becomes unsynced.

12:01.938 --> 12:05.601
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's supposed to be able to just add it as a second controller, but I'm not doing something right.

12:05.961 --> 12:06.782
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know what it is.

12:07.783 --> 12:08.523
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a big deal.

12:08.543 --> 12:11.085
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not something that's really officially supported anyway.

12:13.147 --> 12:17.030
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, games, I've checked out some of the games on there, and they're pretty cool.

12:17.070 --> 12:21.774
[SPEAKER_06]: I sideloaded Grand Theft Auto 3, which is... It works.

12:23.475 --> 12:35.938
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played 3 on my phone, so I don't know how... Actually, I did play 3 on my iPod one time, but then I was like, this is way too big and it doesn't work very well with the touch control, so I deleted it.

12:36.118 --> 12:41.139
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked about Final Fantasy 3 specifically because I've played the DS version of that.

12:41.619 --> 12:51.481
[SPEAKER_08]: I've emulated the NES one from way back in the day with the translation patch, but more recently I've played the iPhone, iPad version of it and the DS version, so I'm kind of curious how the Ouya one compares.

12:51.621 --> 12:52.782
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's probably the same.

12:52.842 --> 12:54.624
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's probably going to be very similar.

12:54.664 --> 12:55.605
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if it's Android.

12:55.625 --> 12:59.990
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember if Square released that on Android, but I wouldn't be surprised.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.852
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they probably... It wouldn't surprise me.

13:02.733 --> 13:04.835
[SPEAKER_06]: So I checked out... I've downloaded it.

13:04.855 --> 13:06.096
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gotten a chance to play it.

13:06.116 --> 13:08.399
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a game called The Ball, which is alright.

13:08.459 --> 13:11.502
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a first-person puzzle game, similar to like...

13:13.063 --> 13:16.546
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal or something like that, except without the portals.

13:16.646 --> 13:21.710
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a game called Phase, which is also a little similar to Portal.

13:22.011 --> 13:33.420
[SPEAKER_06]: You change the phase of your shield or whatever, and you can go between certain force fields, and if you have the opposite phase, those force fields are solid, so you have to

13:34.120 --> 13:36.102
[SPEAKER_06]: Play with that mechanic and stuff.

13:36.722 --> 13:43.228
[SPEAKER_06]: I played this Pengu poker game, which is something I'm probably reviewing soon.

13:43.548 --> 13:44.709
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's pretty fun.

13:44.749 --> 13:48.231
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of reminded me of... Oh, what was that?

13:48.352 --> 13:53.756
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like a poker RPG game that was on the iOS platforms.

13:53.936 --> 13:55.037
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what that was called.

13:55.097 --> 14:00.101
[SPEAKER_06]: But Puzzle Poker... Swords and Poker, that's what it was.

14:00.661 --> 14:17.491
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I played that you used to love the hell out of that game on iOS Sword to Poker is fun see this is not necessarily like that it's not an RPG or anything it's basically a combination of poker and bingo so you're making hands based on like you have so many cards and so you're making hands based on the way you'd score in bingo

14:18.179 --> 14:25.043
[SPEAKER_08]: Clarify and comment from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com GameGuru says, Squeenix did release Final Fantasy 3 on the Amazon store, I believe.

14:25.063 --> 14:26.344
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.

14:27.304 --> 14:27.704
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

14:27.744 --> 14:30.126
[SPEAKER_08]: If people are going to pay the $15 for it, go for it, right?

14:30.166 --> 14:32.647
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I think they probably released it everywhere.

14:32.867 --> 14:37.810
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so to try and wrap up, because this is only a three-hour show, you paid, what, $100?

14:37.890 --> 14:39.491
[SPEAKER_08]: What was your donor level?

14:39.571 --> 14:42.352
[SPEAKER_08]: So you paid $99 for this a year ago.

14:42.472 --> 14:43.193
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's your Ouya.

14:43.493 --> 14:44.073
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you feel?

14:44.413 --> 14:44.894
[SPEAKER_08]: Worth it?

14:45.974 --> 14:46.995
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alright.

14:47.175 --> 14:47.556
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright.

14:47.836 --> 14:48.717
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little soon to tell.

14:48.797 --> 14:52.961
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's kind of like a console that plays Xbox Live Indie games.

14:53.181 --> 14:54.182
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it.

14:54.262 --> 14:58.246
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're going to have some exclusive stuff eventually, which is alright.

14:58.326 --> 15:00.668
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in some of it, it's kind of like, whoo!

15:00.908 --> 15:05.469
[SPEAKER_08]: With Microsoft clearly sunsetting that whole thing, unless we get surprised on the 24th.

15:05.509 --> 15:06.909
[SPEAKER_08]: With Microsoft clearly sunsetting.

15:06.969 --> 15:08.250
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great vision for the console.

15:08.270 --> 15:08.830
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought of something.

15:08.930 --> 15:09.090
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

15:09.250 --> 15:10.310
[SPEAKER_03]: What this reminds me of.

15:10.610 --> 15:10.990
[SPEAKER_08]: What the?

15:11.310 --> 15:13.811
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of this looks-wise.

15:14.091 --> 15:16.592
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying this to insult the machine.

15:17.252 --> 15:27.414
[SPEAKER_03]: Aesthetically, it looks like those weird kind of blingy stuff that they give you at employee fairs when they open up your medical benefits and they try to give you stuff to advertise whatever the provider is.

15:27.634 --> 15:29.195
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

15:47.901 --> 16:14.658
[SPEAKER_06]: some other things about the console it doesn't just do games of course it does you know other applications I mean you can pretty much load anything you want on it it's got Twitch on there right now so you can actually view Twitch streams and stuff through that it's got it's got a I don't know if it's Stitcher some radio thing I don't actually listen to a lot but I know I recognize the app I just don't listen to any of these radio apps except for like Pandora but it's

16:14.818 --> 16:17.839
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a radio app on there, a music thing.

16:18.480 --> 16:31.365
[SPEAKER_06]: And Minecraft worked great on it, except the controls don't work because right now they have the controls locked to just the... Well, the controller stuff, they have it locked to the Sony one that... What was it?

16:31.425 --> 16:33.826
[SPEAKER_06]: The... What the fuck is that called?

16:34.146 --> 16:38.548
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sony... Remember their stupid... Almost like the PSP phone, but it wasn't the phone?

16:39.488 --> 16:40.128
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

16:40.669 --> 16:40.849
[SPEAKER_06]: The...

16:42.029 --> 16:44.550
[SPEAKER_06]: and Xperia Play.

16:44.950 --> 16:51.451
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have it locked to that and a future update is going to update it with controller support and I think it'll run.

16:51.671 --> 16:59.493
[SPEAKER_06]: But it runs smooth because it has a touchpad on the actual controller so you can use that to click the buttons a little bit.

17:00.074 --> 17:05.395
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also other apps I can get where I can map stuff to the buttons but I haven't bothered to try that yet.

17:05.615 --> 17:11.079
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so during the break tonight here in studio in about an hour, we're going to plug that in real quick because it's really easy to set up, right?

17:11.099 --> 17:13.060
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just HDMI and a power cord.

17:13.120 --> 17:19.564
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we should be able to throw that in the TV real quick and during the break just kind of take a look at it because I'm dying to see what this is.

17:19.845 --> 17:22.526
[SPEAKER_08]: The retail release of this is in what, June, supposedly?

17:22.626 --> 17:25.268
[SPEAKER_06]: June 4th, supposedly, and they keep saying that they're not going to be late.

17:25.328 --> 17:28.110
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're going to delay it, but right now they're saying June 4th.

17:28.510 --> 17:30.211
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that like right before E3?

17:30.692 --> 17:35.375
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an interesting time to... It is, but... That's so Saturn.

17:36.195 --> 17:40.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing is, it's not something that really needs a huge fanfare because this is all a lot of these games.

17:41.019 --> 17:45.042
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, everything's basically built by the community anyway.

17:45.102 --> 17:46.123
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be interesting.

17:46.503 --> 17:47.624
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's stuff that they have.

17:47.644 --> 17:50.006
[SPEAKER_06]: They have MMOs that have been ported over from it and stuff.

17:50.386 --> 17:52.368
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can show you some of the apps on there.

17:52.548 --> 17:54.029
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's apps coming on there every day.

17:55.430 --> 17:55.630
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

17:55.890 --> 17:56.290
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be neat.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.452
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you sound pretty enthusiastic about it, even though you just said you're on the fence.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.532
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that excited.

18:00.552 --> 18:01.613
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, well, here's the thing.

18:01.653 --> 18:04.474
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that... Like, this isn't going to be something I'm going to be playing all the time.

18:04.514 --> 18:06.395
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be something I'll go back to every now and then.

18:06.795 --> 18:12.777
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because now that I've gotten a little bit more comfortable with playing on PC with a lot of... Because I buy a lot of Steam crap.

18:13.077 --> 18:14.838
[SPEAKER_06]: I buy a lot of Steam crap.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.199
[SPEAKER_06]: You and everybody else.

18:16.219 --> 18:16.579
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

18:16.719 --> 18:18.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, especially when it's sale time.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.901
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going in and actually starting to play a lot of that Steam crap that I bought.

18:21.981 --> 18:23.402
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know...

18:24.002 --> 18:24.282
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

18:24.422 --> 18:25.423
[SPEAKER_06]: There's stuff I like on there.

18:25.744 --> 18:28.766
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'll try to play around with it.

18:29.547 --> 18:32.249
[SPEAKER_08]: Good question from True in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.

18:32.409 --> 18:34.030
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the Ouya not run hot?

18:34.551 --> 18:36.032
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they've got a big fan in the bottom.

18:36.052 --> 18:37.573
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually like a fan vent in the bottom.

18:37.593 --> 18:38.494
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably the heaviest part.

18:38.514 --> 18:39.435
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, they have it weighted.

18:39.615 --> 18:42.898
[SPEAKER_06]: They have it weighted on purpose so that it doesn't tip over when you plug the cords in the back.

18:43.018 --> 18:43.678
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, smart.

18:43.919 --> 18:45.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though it, I mean, yeah, you...

18:45.840 --> 18:46.440
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

19:09.508 --> 19:10.990
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you

19:26.148 --> 19:29.090
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing a regular Mass Effect 3 stream on Thursday night.

19:48.379 --> 19:55.827
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this whole streaming game thing has been kind of growing over the past couple of years, but I really feel like in the past couple of months, it's exploded.

19:56.648 --> 19:58.049
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's doing game streams.

19:58.330 --> 20:04.717
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's just very interesting to me that it's become so easy and so many people are doing it.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.279
[SPEAKER_08]: All three of us have been doing game streams at certain times.

20:08.919 --> 20:09.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby's been doing it.

20:11.261 --> 20:11.961
[SPEAKER_08]: Even our listeners.

20:12.181 --> 20:15.804
[SPEAKER_08]: I see a lot of the Twitter things like, come see my Twitch TV.

20:16.164 --> 20:16.824
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so easy.

20:16.904 --> 20:22.168
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just gaming either because I've seen art streams.

20:23.088 --> 20:23.969
[SPEAKER_08]: Podcast recordings.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.571
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people who don't have a setup like the network or whatever do that.

20:26.711 --> 20:35.677
[SPEAKER_03]: When Depeche Mode's album was about to come out, my friend Amanda, who does a lot of stuff for their official fan club, got to preview the album on a live stream.

20:36.817 --> 20:41.941
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to basically do a live stream preview of the new album, play all the music on it.

20:41.961 --> 20:42.501
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good.

20:43.142 --> 20:43.262
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

20:44.102 --> 21:00.745
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah I think I honestly think it's good because I mean the thing that I always like is if it's a game that I've seen you know 50,000 times I like seeing people kind of rip it apart sort of do the MST3K thing which is pretty much what I do when I go stream is yell at people in the game who can't hear me

21:01.409 --> 21:03.571
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw in chat says, yeah, which is why I love it.

21:03.651 --> 21:05.512
[SPEAKER_08]: So many games to watch people play.

21:07.293 --> 21:08.154
[SPEAKER_08]: And what was the comment?

21:08.214 --> 21:08.454
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

21:08.474 --> 21:13.318
[SPEAKER_08]: And Tiger Claw had started that off at our chat room saying, if only you could stream the Ouya on Twitch so we can see it.

21:13.698 --> 21:17.561
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have the capture card for the TV yet, but that's on the list of want to get in future.

21:17.781 --> 21:19.822
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my buddies sent me a link to a good one that she uses.

21:20.082 --> 21:20.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.

21:20.563 --> 21:21.383
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll send it to you.

21:21.483 --> 21:23.725
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting one event soon.

21:24.385 --> 21:26.267
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll do HDMI capture soon.

21:27.003 --> 21:30.025
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys missed a pretty good stream on I think it was Friday night.

21:30.405 --> 21:30.986
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

21:31.106 --> 21:32.126
[SPEAKER_08]: We were playing Mass Effect.

21:32.206 --> 21:33.107
[SPEAKER_08]: And he didn't invite me.

21:33.147 --> 21:34.288
[SPEAKER_08]: I had problems getting started.

21:34.548 --> 21:36.889
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the whole thing was that Shane was going to get drunk.

21:37.570 --> 21:39.671
[SPEAKER_08]: And it took him about 20 minutes.

21:40.571 --> 21:41.872
[SPEAKER_08]: The stream lasted an hour.

21:42.313 --> 21:43.353
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he passed out.

21:43.653 --> 21:43.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

21:44.014 --> 21:45.114
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was pretty funny.

21:46.355 --> 21:47.796
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was a few that were there and got to see it.

21:47.816 --> 21:49.237
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to do Wednesday Night Multiplayer.

21:49.997 --> 21:50.517
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

21:50.537 --> 21:53.978
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to dance around all the live shows on the stream.

21:54.458 --> 21:55.799
[SPEAKER_03]: So can I continue?

21:55.859 --> 21:56.439
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm sorry.

21:56.479 --> 21:59.040
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to talk about... I'm trying to promote your streaming site.

21:59.100 --> 21:59.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor Shane.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

22:05.041 --> 22:15.704
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I've started doing that just because I don't... I get bored and usually... Sometimes it's Dan's day off, but a lot of times he'll have a Wednesday where he works late.

22:16.337 --> 22:17.979
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I'm there by myself.

22:18.079 --> 22:19.180
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the problem?

22:19.220 --> 22:22.303
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hop on and chat with people and yell at video games.

22:25.447 --> 22:27.689
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got an iCade.

22:28.650 --> 22:30.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, and I saw you ordered yours.

22:31.413 --> 22:34.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan ordered an iCade because Amazon has them for $44.

22:35.297 --> 22:37.199
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're talking about marked down by about $100.

22:39.355 --> 22:55.469
[SPEAKER_03]: so I went on a purchasing rampage trying to buy games that would work on it because I had none and it was pretty stupid of me because I spent like the last of my play cash on going to the baseball game last night too which was really good

22:56.061 --> 23:12.810
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got Pac-Man, the Atari's Greatest Hits I already had Fixed at Felix, but I can't figure out how to get it to work Metal Slug 3, the Midway Arcade, Blazing Star, and the Namco Arcade So I bought one game on the Namco Arcade, which was Galaga I tried playing Starblade with the arcade, and Starblade doesn't work

23:13.931 --> 23:21.397
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these will have a one-day demo thing that you can play through unless you buy tokens or the full version of the game.

23:22.038 --> 23:25.501
[SPEAKER_03]: And for most of these, the full version of the game is like a couple bucks.

23:26.882 --> 23:27.883
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Slug 3 was about $5.

23:28.584 --> 23:29.164
[SPEAKER_03]: It was worth it.

23:29.484 --> 23:33.268
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought of another game that I think supports IK that you might not have.

23:33.308 --> 23:34.749
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Activision Collection.

23:35.490 --> 23:37.612
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Kaboom is free on that.

23:37.832 --> 23:38.352
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

23:38.412 --> 23:39.754
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the games is free that you get with that.

23:39.814 --> 23:39.994
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

23:40.310 --> 23:41.211
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got plenty right now.

23:42.393 --> 23:44.596
[SPEAKER_08]: When you told me the iKids were on sale, ordered one.

23:44.836 --> 23:45.316
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

23:45.337 --> 23:46.358
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm getting it Monday.

23:46.678 --> 23:47.479
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited.

23:48.541 --> 23:55.730
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I grabbed an app in the marketplace called Gridly a couple months ago, which is just the main emulator in disguise.

23:56.170 --> 23:59.973
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know a lot of you guys are like, but emulators are bad.

24:00.553 --> 24:02.414
[SPEAKER_08]: But I support the real deals too.

24:02.955 --> 24:07.177
[SPEAKER_08]: But since there aren't a lot of real deals on iOS for these things, I can't wait.

24:07.878 --> 24:12.461
[SPEAKER_06]: My cocktail cabinet with bar top is just collecting dust at my work.

24:13.341 --> 24:17.104
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be real guys, are they ever going to put out Miss Nude World 96 as an app?

24:17.324 --> 24:17.844
[SPEAKER_08]: I doubt it.

24:17.864 --> 24:20.246
[SPEAKER_08]: It has Miss Nude World 96 on it too.

24:22.107 --> 24:26.050
[SPEAKER_08]: The only way I will ever get to play Miss Nude World 96 is to turn to the dark side.

24:26.110 --> 24:26.570
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Jamie.

24:28.231 --> 24:28.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

24:30.873 --> 24:33.975
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I actually, I'm probably going to be canceling WoW.

24:35.876 --> 24:45.363
[SPEAKER_03]: because unless these bastards don't ever get back to me because I've been trying and trying and trying Ragnarok Online 2 went into free to play

24:46.107 --> 24:47.989
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that and I thought of you this week on Steam.

24:48.049 --> 24:48.830
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tried.

24:49.731 --> 24:55.176
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had registered through whatever Gravity's new site is for it.

24:55.576 --> 24:57.698
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now I can't register it through Steam.

24:58.239 --> 25:07.027
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the same freaking problem that it had back with the old IRO was that you can't find the...

25:07.828 --> 25:36.669
[SPEAKER_03]: installer anywhere and I tried to download from like one of their mirrors and it kept quitting on me so I'm like I could download the Steam one fine but I couldn't run it and so it says if you have problems email blah blah blah I'm like not replying to me yet so I don't know what to do so I'm really supremely pissed and I still need to update my PSO2 God I played something else I don't remember alright seriously then we'll go over to Loki Loki how was your gaming week

25:37.957 --> 25:38.958
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a few things.

25:39.799 --> 25:45.443
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally installed Grand Theft Auto San... Well, I tried installing Ted Reyes on there.

25:46.864 --> 25:54.069
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got it to work, but mapping the buttons to the Xbox 360 controller are... It's pretty much impossible to get it to work correctly.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.470
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of gave up on that.

25:56.650 --> 26:00.553
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still trying to get my copy back from my sister, but she put it in storage.

26:02.034 --> 26:03.134
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to get it.

26:03.254 --> 26:05.755
[SPEAKER_06]: What was she thinking putting your game in storage?

26:06.396 --> 26:08.016
[SPEAKER_06]: I basically gave her the PlayStation 2.

26:08.376 --> 26:10.257
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess siblings can get away with that a little more.

26:10.277 --> 26:10.537
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

26:10.577 --> 26:11.997
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not in a huge hurry to play Zandris.

26:12.038 --> 26:12.698
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already played it.

26:12.718 --> 26:18.420
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to play it on PC because I have it on PC, but I can't map the buttons correctly.

26:18.660 --> 26:22.141
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a program to do it, but it doesn't work right, and you have to unpatch the game.

26:22.181 --> 26:25.302
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a pain in the ass, so I'm just not worrying about that.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.923
[SPEAKER_06]: I got four episodes from Liberty City on there.

26:28.163 --> 26:28.923
[SPEAKER_06]: I played it for a little bit.

26:28.943 --> 26:33.964
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, cool, I'm going to play episodes from Liberty City and I'm going to play Deathmatch and I'm going to totally dominate Deathmatch.

26:34.024 --> 26:36.645
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no one on fucking line anymore.

26:36.885 --> 26:41.886
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nobody, nobody at all playing any sort of ranked Deathmatch or Deathmatch or anything.

26:42.066 --> 26:43.806
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all fucking free mode.

26:45.126 --> 26:52.008
[SPEAKER_06]: Free mode's fun, but I want to play a competitive game in Grand Theft Auto and I can't do that anymore because no one plays it.

26:52.608 --> 27:18.256
[SPEAKER_06]: which is why I need Grand Theft Auto V and it's such a fucking cock tease to have three fucking trailers and extended previews all over the goddamn internet I need this game, it's my crack I'm fiending for this game so yeah, Grand Theft Auto V is going to be awesome I can't wait to play it I guess I don't even need to ask about those trailers that came out this week and how you felt because I think you made it pretty clear

27:18.896 --> 27:19.537
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic.

27:19.577 --> 27:45.954
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, even there was like a 90-minute kind of talking about it because basically everyone was shown like about 30 minutes of gameplay that talked everything about from the mechanic between switching between each protagonist in the game and how they're, you know, the map is about five times the size of Red Dead Redemption, one and a half times of Red Dead Redemption's worth in the ocean.

27:46.554 --> 28:09.479
[SPEAKER_06]: under the ocean actually so there's a lot of scuba diving in the game um you can pretty much do whatever i mean you can do whatever you want in the game but it's just so much to explore it's just gonna it's gonna be awesome um and just a lot of mechanics in the game sound really good like the heists and how you have to do missions to kind of do recon on different things and set up the actual heists and you hire your people to help you out and

28:11.232 --> 28:12.773
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks like a very good game.

28:13.133 --> 28:16.214
[SPEAKER_06]: And a very good storyline going along with that.

28:16.514 --> 28:17.154
[SPEAKER_06]: Actual games to play.

28:17.174 --> 28:22.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Saints Row III, I'm still trying to go through and finish off my achievements that don't involve co-op.

28:23.317 --> 28:29.399
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just getting so bored with a lot of these games that I don't know what I want to play anymore.

28:29.419 --> 28:32.880
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I can't think of anything that I want to play that sounds exciting.

28:33.120 --> 28:38.662
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like Grand Theft Auto V. I can't think of anything other than Saints Row IV and Grand Theft Auto V and maybe Earth Defense Force 2025.

28:38.722 --> 28:38.803
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

28:40.323 --> 28:41.464
[SPEAKER_06]: None of those are coming out yet.

28:42.004 --> 28:46.888
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm kind of in this weird position where I'm just kind of going on autopilot and playing stuff.

28:48.502 --> 28:50.963
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really want to play, but I'm kind of playing it anyways.

29:11.234 --> 29:13.757
[SPEAKER_06]: The Cars Don't Realize That The Bridge Was Up

29:28.709 --> 29:35.950
[SPEAKER_06]: That almost inspired me to even bring my singing voice and do a Buggy Saints Row the Third.

29:36.630 --> 29:38.571
[SPEAKER_08]: That is begging for the Benny Hill theme.

29:38.751 --> 29:41.411
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just seriously like, what?

29:41.791 --> 29:42.732
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so terrible.

29:42.952 --> 29:45.172
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even a mission I had to do where I had to stop this.

29:45.312 --> 29:46.632
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's an assassination mission.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.853
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to kill this guy before he kills him.

29:48.973 --> 29:51.233
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to commit suicide by jumping off the bridge.

29:51.593 --> 29:56.434
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she needs to collect the money, insurance money, but it's null and void if he commits suicide.

29:56.914 --> 29:57.394
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

30:16.929 --> 30:17.710
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

30:40.012 --> 30:42.133
[SPEAKER_06]: My safe house and just starts shooting at me.

30:42.153 --> 30:44.734
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, how the fuck did this guy even get here in the first place?

30:44.774 --> 30:48.096
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not even supposed to be coming after me yet because I don't have the right outfit on.

30:48.116 --> 30:49.196
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't even found this guy.

30:49.356 --> 30:50.157
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just ridiculous.

30:50.597 --> 30:56.199
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I know people have their opinions on you and your strong opinions about Nintendo and other things.

30:56.299 --> 31:02.182
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it's amazing to me how when you really like a game, you will make that game last forever.

31:02.942 --> 31:05.263
[SPEAKER_06]: I've bought it on two platforms already.

31:05.283 --> 31:05.964
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

31:06.004 --> 31:06.544
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've

31:08.234 --> 31:08.995
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

31:09.175 --> 31:14.318
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, and then beyond that, Ouya, I played lots of games on the Ouya, and we talked about a lot of those already.

31:15.278 --> 31:18.140
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else did I play this week?

31:18.540 --> 31:19.501
[SPEAKER_06]: More Call of Duty.

31:19.981 --> 31:23.963
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually am playing through a little bit more of the story campaign on 3, which is, it's alright.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.744
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's Call of Duty.

31:26.525 --> 31:28.366
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have a great story.

31:28.426 --> 31:29.927
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's cinematic.

31:29.987 --> 31:30.587
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of fun.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.108
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't play Call of Duty for the story.

31:32.188 --> 31:33.109
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you don't really.

31:33.309 --> 31:34.169
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't really play for the story.

31:34.189 --> 31:34.870
[SPEAKER_06]: You play for the action.

31:34.910 --> 31:36.191
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just watching like an action movie.

31:36.211 --> 31:36.571
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

31:37.371 --> 31:41.452
[SPEAKER_06]: and MinecraftXPLA because we did a VOG gaming night.

31:41.553 --> 31:42.833
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually had someone show up this time.

31:42.873 --> 31:43.913
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.

31:44.393 --> 31:44.874
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

31:45.114 --> 31:45.614
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

31:45.814 --> 31:48.795
[SPEAKER_08]: I really wanted to go, but I had to work on one of my other projects that night.

31:48.855 --> 31:49.355
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.395
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're doing Forza this week, right?

31:50.415 --> 31:51.716
[SPEAKER_06]: This week we're doing Forza Horizon.

31:51.736 --> 31:52.036
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be there.

31:52.056 --> 31:53.276
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully that will bring out more people.

31:53.517 --> 31:53.937
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be there.

31:54.217 --> 31:56.137
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza Horizon this Thursday, 8 p.m.

31:56.157 --> 31:56.958
[SPEAKER_06]: Pacific time.

31:57.018 --> 31:58.078
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably goes for about two hours.

31:58.558 --> 32:00.099
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least that's how long I can play.

32:01.179 --> 32:01.640
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:15.758 --> 32:19.800
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura Croft's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Good times with it?

32:39.366 --> 32:40.948
[SPEAKER_08]: Death isn't super frustrating in that game.

32:57.621 --> 33:00.063
[SPEAKER_03]: and it starts you pretty much right from the section you left off on.

33:00.243 --> 33:00.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

33:00.463 --> 33:03.206
[SPEAKER_03]: But I need to find the picture on my Tumblr and post it in chat for everybody.

33:03.566 --> 33:03.966
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

33:04.067 --> 33:06.409
[SPEAKER_08]: Live.VogNetwork.com My Gaming Week.

33:06.429 --> 33:09.071
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try to be kind of quick here because I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

33:09.111 --> 33:11.453
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I spent a lot of time playing some old stuff.

33:11.613 --> 33:13.875
[SPEAKER_08]: A virtual console on Wii U. Go figure.

33:13.955 --> 33:14.055
[SPEAKER_08]: I've...

33:14.976 --> 33:17.317
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually bought a lot of stuff on it.

33:17.437 --> 33:18.758
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of embarrassed to say.

33:19.238 --> 33:21.879
[SPEAKER_08]: But Mega Man, the old school Mega Man came out this week.

33:21.939 --> 33:23.940
[SPEAKER_08]: And how could I not?

33:24.020 --> 33:26.961
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mega Man games have some of the best soundtracks.

33:27.781 --> 33:29.662
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to check it out on Virtual Console.

33:29.762 --> 33:35.664
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm loving the whole restore points are a godsend in stages like Iceman's stage.

33:35.744 --> 33:40.306
[SPEAKER_08]: That stage can go to hell for those blocks that appear and disappear.

33:40.766 --> 33:43.787
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I've been having a good time with that.

33:44.908 --> 33:51.510
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, there's another game, but DarkSakura's going to bring it up later in the show, so I'll wait to get my comments on that until later.

33:53.251 --> 34:02.995
[SPEAKER_08]: And, oh, I was on Steam randomly last night, and I was looking at the free-to-play games, and I was going to do Ragnarok Online 2, but I decided instead to play Puzzle Pirates.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.316
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember Puzzle Pirates?

34:04.436 --> 34:05.596
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that the other day.

34:05.636 --> 34:07.397
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh, that's on Steam?

34:07.417 --> 34:07.497
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

34:07.677 --> 34:08.518
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, right?

34:08.538 --> 34:08.858
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet.

34:09.018 --> 34:10.480
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, God, that took me back.

34:10.540 --> 34:11.701
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like, we all played that.

34:11.981 --> 34:15.665
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, that's what we used to play when we were all playing DDR regularly.

34:15.725 --> 34:17.207
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, a ton of us were playing Puzzle Pirates.

34:17.247 --> 34:18.188
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember, like, Irene got us all into that.

34:18.208 --> 34:18.848
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play it at the time.

34:19.429 --> 34:22.112
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I was actually, during those days, I was playing Ragnarok Online on...

34:22.805 --> 34:41.225
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's the bilging is still the same freaking thing with the match but they've added a lot to it like you have rooms you customize and it's definitely like a game that they put out there for more lower-end PCs you could probably play puzzle pirates just fine on like a netbook like is that kind of game so yeah I was that was kind of fun to just kind of get back into that again

34:41.605 --> 34:50.131
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, World of Warcraft, Mass Effect 3, a lot of the usual suspects, and another game that I'm going to be reviewing on VOG soon, so stay tuned for that.

34:51.292 --> 34:54.554
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's get into some gaming news.

34:54.734 --> 34:57.196
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick, plugs for the Twitters, the Facebooks, and all that.

34:57.276 --> 34:59.717
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLRs, where you can follow us on Twitter.

35:00.057 --> 35:02.259
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.121
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't really have a whole lot else to add.

35:05.181 --> 35:07.262
[SPEAKER_08]: We may not be here Memorial Day weekend.

35:07.442 --> 35:11.145
[SPEAKER_08]: I may be gone, but we'll let you know in the next couple weeks.

35:11.765 --> 35:14.286
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay tuned for all that live programming information.

35:15.006 --> 35:16.186
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's talk about the gaming news.

35:16.426 --> 35:17.266
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, start us off tonight.

35:17.526 --> 35:20.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so apparently the Wii U has now been hacked.

35:20.787 --> 35:37.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least the mod chip creators behind the Wii Key they have now said that they've claimed to, I guess, compromise Wii U security and completely reverse the Wii U drive authentication, disk encryption file system, and everything else.

35:40.072 --> 35:40.332
[SPEAKER_06]: And

35:41.272 --> 36:02.665
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I guess what's supposed to come of this is that they're going to either create a replacement optical drive that'll go into your Wii U, or they're going to create some sort of... Like, I've seen this before with some of the Xbox 360 drives, where they'll have a daughter board or something like that that replaces a board on there, and you can just kind of hook in the ribbon cables, and it's a bypass or something.

36:03.065 --> 36:04.326
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll have something like that.

36:04.886 --> 36:08.969
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Wii key... Actually, the Wii key, I want to say... No, that's not the mod chip I have in my Wii.

36:09.049 --> 36:09.629
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have a...

36:11.491 --> 36:12.973
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

36:27.052 --> 36:29.233
[SPEAKER_06]: And kind of show, I guess, how serious that this is.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.555
[SPEAKER_06]: They've also dumped their first game, Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth.

36:32.715 --> 36:34.616
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the probably most terrible games out there.

36:35.197 --> 36:48.605
[SPEAKER_06]: But they have dumped it and it's... Well, somebody's dumped it and it's been released out there on the internet to download and do nothing with because there's no such mod ship to play it on yet.

36:49.725 --> 36:49.865
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

36:51.306 --> 36:52.787
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Nintendo is aware of it.

36:52.947 --> 37:05.036
[SPEAKER_06]: They say that they're going to find a way to bypass everything, but thus begins the back and forth struggle that is hacking and patching, more hacking and more patching, so on and so forth.

37:05.096 --> 37:09.739
[SPEAKER_06]: And so far, there's really no homebrew needs of this.

37:10.139 --> 37:13.682
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess maybe you can make your own software for the Wii U, but this is mainly piracy.

37:15.205 --> 37:16.005
[SPEAKER_08]: Hacker's gonna hack.

37:16.066 --> 37:18.247
[SPEAKER_08]: Or backups, I guess, if you will.

37:18.787 --> 37:19.167
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.

37:20.388 --> 37:24.910
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I think the real question to ask here, though, is how hard is this to pull off?

37:24.970 --> 37:27.852
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the harder it is, the less impact this is gonna have.

37:27.952 --> 37:35.396
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that the pirates and the people that are all about wanting to steal games as much as they... Oh, excuse me, make backups as fast as they can.

37:35.416 --> 37:36.817
[SPEAKER_08]: They're always gonna find a way in.

37:37.077 --> 37:40.679
[SPEAKER_08]: But the question is, how easy is it for somebody else...

37:41.219 --> 37:43.601
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be like a mod chip.

37:43.641 --> 37:50.045
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to have to buy a mod chip, you're going to have to install the mod chip onto your system or install some sort of part on your system.

37:50.485 --> 37:59.391
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't like the Wii Homebrew channel where it was a hack that modified your dashboard to run a program that you could then run games off a hard drive.

37:59.431 --> 38:00.472
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that simple.

38:00.932 --> 38:02.113
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to buy a mod chip.

38:02.213 --> 38:06.354
[SPEAKER_06]: Can Nintendo brick your console with a firmware update if you were running this?

38:06.834 --> 38:08.315
[SPEAKER_06]: They may threaten to do that.

38:08.395 --> 38:09.335
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they can.

38:10.155 --> 38:15.737
[SPEAKER_06]: There's drive emulators and stuff like that that are already out there.

38:15.757 --> 38:17.958
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't they do it?

38:19.338 --> 38:21.779
[SPEAKER_08]: My point is, why would Nintendo play softball with this?

38:22.299 --> 38:22.419
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

38:22.960 --> 38:26.502
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of false positives is what it is.

38:26.562 --> 38:36.749
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you have someone that legitimately hasn't done anything and you fuck their console up, they're already in not a very strong position with their console to piss people off like that.

38:37.049 --> 38:44.454
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they're probably going to let this thing get released, get people to buy the console because they're like, oh, I'm going to hack all this stuff up and then patch it.

38:44.634 --> 38:45.735
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

38:47.133 --> 38:48.234
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, okay, that's smart.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.815
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what I would think that they would do.

38:49.855 --> 38:56.080
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm sure at the same... How many people went and got a PSP the day they heard that NES emulators are runnable on it?

38:56.100 --> 39:03.565
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and then, well, on top of that, though, they're probably going to be, you know, prompted if this does come out, you know, pretty widespread.

39:03.725 --> 39:11.131
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be prompted by their third-party developers that, hey, we need you to fix this because we're not making a lot off of these Wii games already.

39:11.451 --> 39:16.575
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we're making even less now because people are pirating them, you know, it's going to be a tough thing.

39:16.995 --> 39:20.539
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I mean, here's the other thing you gotta consider too.

39:21.140 --> 39:28.708
[SPEAKER_06]: These aren't necessarily DVDs that they're running on anymore, so you're gonna have to have a Blu-ray burner and Blu-ray media to do that.

39:29.729 --> 39:30.690
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that stuff's coming down.

39:30.730 --> 39:31.791
[SPEAKER_08]: That stuff's coming way down.

39:31.831 --> 39:35.395
[SPEAKER_08]: We're only a couple years away from that being standard, really, for PCs.

39:35.868 --> 39:51.994
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, if anything, I could see them go on the route of, like, the X-Key or something, where it's basically a drive, a middle, you know, kind of in the middle board that allows you to run, it'll emulate the drive, and you'll run stuff off a hard drive.

39:52.395 --> 39:55.476
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be easy like that, is the way I see it, that they're gonna do it.

39:56.036 --> 39:58.617
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, I mean, it's progress, I guess.

39:58.878 --> 40:06.401
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they've completely reversed the file system and stuff, who's to say that they can't come up with their own, like, modified dashboard that'd run on there?

40:06.421 --> 40:10.643
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if they've figured out how to, you know, do the file system stuff and then the keys for that.

40:10.723 --> 40:14.945
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and the hacking community is going to have an interesting case to make, too.

40:15.165 --> 40:17.487
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I understand why they wanted to do Homebroom Channel.

40:17.827 --> 40:18.267
[SPEAKER_08]: Homebroom?

40:18.647 --> 40:35.425
[SPEAKER_08]: Homebrew channel on Wii because there wasn't a lot of indie friendly stuff on the Wii but Wii U is really trying to make a case like we are the indie friendly platform you've even heard the indie developers come out and say yeah like Wii U is gonna like I know this is gonna shock people but Nintendo's the platform to be on right now if you're indie

40:36.238 --> 40:43.843
[SPEAKER_08]: So does the hacking community have as much of a case when it seems like Nintendo is really embracing a lot of the homebrew stuff open arms?

40:44.264 --> 40:58.554
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I shouldn't say homebrew, but indie stuff open arms, thus negating the need for a homebrew channel that is totally clean and without piracy.

40:58.694 --> 41:03.738
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't think that they're really going to... It's just one hacking group doing something, and that's it.

41:04.158 --> 41:05.499
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to have people that want to...

41:06.099 --> 41:09.361
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in the business of selling mod chips, so they're going to want to make a mod chip to sell.

41:09.562 --> 41:11.203
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wii U is just the console of the moment.

41:11.283 --> 41:13.664
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as soon as PlayStation 4 is out, they'll be working on that too.

41:13.904 --> 41:14.725
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, yeah.

41:15.345 --> 41:15.586
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

41:16.066 --> 41:23.171
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Loki alluded to this a minute ago, and I was mentioning this earlier in the show when they were teasing me about the Wii message light being on.

41:23.491 --> 41:29.495
[SPEAKER_08]: But Nintendo actually sent a message to all the Wii owners this week saying, hey, have you checked out the Wii U?

41:30.035 --> 41:32.957
[SPEAKER_08]: So it seems odd to me that it took them this long to do it.

41:33.277 --> 41:35.359
[SPEAKER_08]: But they did send a message to everybody that says, quote,

41:36.099 --> 41:39.882
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know that you can play nearly all of your existing Wii games on Wii U?

41:40.383 --> 41:45.527
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you could play every Wii game on Wii U. Why did they say nearly all?

41:45.847 --> 41:48.969
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're counting like, you know, maybe Virtual Console and stuff.

41:49.029 --> 41:51.371
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there some stuff that you can't quite port over?

41:51.511 --> 41:52.792
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there was something that didn't transfer over.

41:52.812 --> 41:54.894
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just something to save their ass if something doesn't work.

41:55.855 --> 41:56.295
[SPEAKER_08]: It's possible.

41:56.455 --> 41:57.156
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, yeah, it's true.

41:57.717 --> 42:06.246
[SPEAKER_08]: Your Wii controllers and many Wii accessories can also be used with the new Wii U console, along with any downloaded games, save data, and other info stored in your existing Wii console.

42:06.687 --> 42:09.009
[SPEAKER_08]: Wii U is the all-new home console from Nintendo.

42:09.149 --> 42:10.551
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just an upgrade.

42:11.251 --> 42:16.137
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an entirely new system that will change the way you and your family experience games and entertainment.

42:17.093 --> 42:18.113
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you hear that, Jimmy Fallon?

42:18.153 --> 42:19.273
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just an upgrade.

42:19.673 --> 42:21.454
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big problem, though.

42:21.914 --> 42:22.694
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, think about it.

42:22.874 --> 42:27.875
[SPEAKER_06]: If they have to go out there and tell people, hey, guys, it's not just a peripheral.

42:27.975 --> 42:28.615
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an upgrade.

42:30.335 --> 42:32.616
[SPEAKER_06]: They've done a poor job marketing it, then.

42:33.176 --> 42:38.537
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that and maybe this is a case now where the name issue is finally biting Nintendo.

42:38.597 --> 42:43.237
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of people razzed them for the Wii name, and that ended up working.

42:43.377 --> 42:43.878
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't matter.

42:43.898 --> 42:44.818
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo did great with that.

42:44.838 --> 42:46.058
[SPEAKER_08]: But this whole Wii U name...

42:47.078 --> 42:53.021
[SPEAKER_08]: I think maybe Nintendo's wondering, I don't know if they are, but I think a lot of people are going, maybe that really wasn't the best name.

42:53.182 --> 42:59.745
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have started off calling it the U. Or, well, Super Wii, which isn't that what they call it in Japan?

43:00.425 --> 43:01.906
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that translates to Super Wii?

43:01.926 --> 43:02.947
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that?

43:03.687 --> 43:09.951
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, yeah, Koopa Kid Jeremy in our chat right there says, this just proves they should have called it something else.

43:10.911 --> 43:11.191
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

43:12.072 --> 43:12.252
[SPEAKER_08]: Agree.

43:14.417 --> 43:31.366
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, what I think is interesting about this also, Iwata, Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata, said in a financial results briefing last week that, quote, we have not been able to solidly communicate the product value of Wii U to our consumers yet, which has been a grand challenge for us.

43:31.747 --> 43:39.611
[SPEAKER_08]: Some have the misunderstanding that Wii U is just Wii with a pad for games, and others even consider Wii U GamePad as a peripheral device connectable to Wii.

43:39.991 --> 43:43.173
[SPEAKER_08]: We feel deeply responsible for not having tried hard enough...

43:43.573 --> 43:45.434
[SPEAKER_08]: to have consumers understand the product.

43:45.774 --> 43:48.255
[SPEAKER_08]: Have they done the commercial onslaught that they did with Wii?

43:48.355 --> 43:51.415
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I remember all those commercials, Wii would like to play, and that whole thing.

43:51.516 --> 43:52.836
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a pretty good marketing plan.

43:53.036 --> 43:55.097
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they do that at all?

43:55.217 --> 43:58.898
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a new marketing campaign going on right now that's really dumb.

43:58.958 --> 44:11.902
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically these families coming in, and they're like bussing them in by, or vanning them in, whatever, taking them by a van, and bring them to Nintendo headquarters to try the Wii U out for the first time, and

44:12.262 --> 44:13.783
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, oh my god!

44:13.843 --> 44:16.043
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo stuff is so awesome!

44:16.083 --> 44:17.424
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the best thing ever!

44:18.084 --> 44:21.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this gamepad is so amazing!

44:21.405 --> 44:22.985
[SPEAKER_06]: This is gonna change it all!

44:23.426 --> 44:30.348
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, seriously, just wanna... Okay, if Nintendo really wants to get their message across about the Wii U, here's what they need to do.

44:30.808 --> 44:36.910
[SPEAKER_08]: They're gonna need to release a Mario soccer game this Christmas, and they need to take it out across America...

44:37.310 --> 44:48.436
[SPEAKER_08]: to all the little peewee soccer championships so all their target audience, the moms and dads of the soccer kids can play Mario soccer and then they can all gossip amongst themselves and get the word out.

44:48.776 --> 44:50.937
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how Nintendo reaches their core audience, right?

44:51.337 --> 44:51.998
[SPEAKER_08]: Soccer games.

44:53.198 --> 44:53.298
[SPEAKER_08]: Eh?

44:53.999 --> 44:54.459
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowling!

44:55.936 --> 45:05.083
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is you had people that were really excited about the Wii, like myself, and bought it because it was a very innovative product at the time.

45:05.163 --> 45:09.207
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, we wish it was kind of like graphics of the Xbox 360 and PS3.

45:09.407 --> 45:10.608
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in it for the donuts.

45:12.089 --> 45:16.873
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you bought it, and then you're like, hmm, I'm not playing anything on it.

45:17.653 --> 45:18.954
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought these Mario games.

45:19.986 --> 45:20.467
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

45:41.597 --> 45:43.178
[SPEAKER_06]: Game's a game in this case, yes.

45:43.459 --> 45:44.660
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's fantastic.

45:44.720 --> 45:48.623
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you know, the developers are so behind, you know, the Wii and stuff.

45:48.683 --> 45:53.767
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they thought it was so great that they decided, hey, EA said, hey, you know what?

45:54.067 --> 45:56.509
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to put out FIFA on this system every year.

45:57.089 --> 46:01.052
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's not going to be a different FIFA, but it'll be the same FIFA every year.

46:02.433 --> 46:04.015
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, we don't want to put any money into it.

46:04.055 --> 46:04.695
[SPEAKER_08]: That's different.

46:04.755 --> 46:06.757
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't blame Nintendo for what EA did.

46:07.389 --> 46:10.438
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Konami decided, hey, you know what, we're gonna do Pro Evo.

46:10.458 --> 46:11.561
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't blame him for that either.

46:11.601 --> 46:12.664
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it with soccer games?

46:12.724 --> 46:13.447
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

46:16.095 --> 46:22.058
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be like me blaming Microsoft for all those terrible rehashes in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade.

46:22.458 --> 46:23.338
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't Microsoft's fault.

46:23.358 --> 46:24.859
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you blame them for all the shovelware on the Wii?

46:25.859 --> 46:27.820
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

46:28.220 --> 46:38.925
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying there wasn't... The Wii U, the step from the Wii or like, you know, previous generation, the GameCube to the Wii, there was a big jump as far as gameplay innovation, stuff like that.

46:39.725 --> 46:40.285
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

47:02.533 --> 47:03.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo Land was not Wii Sports

47:20.074 --> 47:23.776
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo Land wasn't Wii Sports, and I don't think it was a system seller.

47:24.116 --> 47:25.477
[SPEAKER_08]: A big, big chunk of people.

47:25.497 --> 47:28.599
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like this is a very deja vu conversation, so we need to move on here a minute.

47:28.619 --> 47:30.620
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like Wii Sports Nintendo version or something.

47:30.700 --> 47:33.881
[SPEAKER_08]: So many people that bought the Wii were not buying the Wii.

47:34.262 --> 47:35.222
[SPEAKER_08]: They were not buying the Wii.

47:35.242 --> 47:38.144
[SPEAKER_08]: They were buying Wii Sports and the console that came with it.

47:38.724 --> 47:40.525
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a big chunk of people that bought the Wii.

47:42.054 --> 47:42.654
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

47:59.484 --> 48:23.324
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know I would bowl like I would bowl you know it was very natural for people but then going to Nintendo Land it's like well it's not that different well this is kind of similar what I've already done in the Wii but why do I need to spend the extra money to play this game that's very similar to what I already have that's the problem it wasn't just it wasn't a big hook that got people in that gamepad was not enough hook to get people onto the system

48:23.672 --> 48:28.674
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if they'd put out a game, like, you know, the thing about Wii Sports is that everybody generally knows those sports.

48:28.714 --> 48:29.554
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody knows bowling.

48:31.015 --> 48:38.337
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically within Wii Sports, that bowling minigame, maybe the tennis to an extent too, but those two games specifically were just huge.

48:38.818 --> 48:42.319
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe Nintendo Wii U needed something, it needed that.

48:43.039 --> 48:48.744
[SPEAKER_08]: for, or still needs, still come out this Christmas, needs something like that that everybody just knows.

48:48.904 --> 48:54.409
[SPEAKER_08]: You know bowling, you know, but you don't necessarily know Donkey Kong Crash Course or F-Zero.

48:54.429 --> 48:55.770
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't necessarily know that stuff.

48:56.390 --> 49:00.594
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why, but my mind goes to like maybe a board game or a card game thing.

49:01.034 --> 49:04.878
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if you could like play it online or something, but that would require Nintendo to...

49:05.458 --> 49:13.134
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, for the Wii U, I think what they would need to have done is done something completely different than the Wii.

49:13.275 --> 49:13.415
[SPEAKER_06]: Like,

49:14.818 --> 49:15.218
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

49:15.318 --> 49:17.760
[SPEAKER_06]: Come up with... I can't really think of what they would have to do.

49:17.940 --> 49:18.260
[SPEAKER_08]: Here you go.

49:18.300 --> 49:21.182
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw says, Too bad Wii Sports didn't have online multiplayer.

49:21.222 --> 49:22.723
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucks playing by yourself against the computer.

49:22.823 --> 49:23.184
[SPEAKER_08]: Kabam.

49:23.604 --> 49:25.585
[SPEAKER_08]: Wii Sports 2 online.

49:25.705 --> 49:30.889
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing with the Wii though, what they're pushing though is that it's a family party atmosphere is what it is.

49:31.209 --> 49:33.430
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not the dynamic anymore.

49:33.470 --> 49:35.452
[SPEAKER_06]: That used to be the dynamic when it was like...

49:36.132 --> 49:36.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

49:57.037 --> 49:57.438
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

49:57.538 --> 50:01.482
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably do more gaming with Shane in Kansas than anybody else.

50:01.562 --> 50:02.002
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

50:02.102 --> 50:04.304
[SPEAKER_06]: Like distance isn't a thing anymore, really.

50:04.384 --> 50:10.250
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you talk to people, you probably talk to people more that are like further away than you do like your neighbors and stuff.

50:10.290 --> 50:11.611
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not the thing.

50:11.691 --> 50:12.192
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the thing.

50:12.672 --> 50:17.936
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't, like the Wii, you know, it was kind of fun playing the Wii stuff, but it was all party game stuff.

50:18.257 --> 50:21.900
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't see myself getting the Wii U because, hey, now five people could play.

50:22.140 --> 50:22.420
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

50:22.500 --> 50:24.382
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have five people in my house ever.

50:24.662 --> 50:24.822
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

50:25.222 --> 50:29.265
[SPEAKER_08]: YYR with a valid counter statement in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

50:29.566 --> 50:33.289
[SPEAKER_08]: The audience for Wii Sports probably didn't care that much about online play.

50:34.813 --> 50:40.238
[SPEAKER_08]: True, but hear me out here a minute, YYR, because you have that camera on every Wii U console.

50:40.859 --> 50:49.027
[SPEAKER_08]: What if Grandma could play bowling with her grandkids, thanks to the internet technology, and every Wii U could have Skype built in?

50:49.047 --> 50:49.448
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome.

50:49.548 --> 50:56.555
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be amazing, but Nintendo's sitting on that goldmine, and that's not what they want to do, for some reason.

50:56.795 --> 50:58.015
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of me also thinks, though, that...

51:24.508 --> 51:35.804
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had this view of Nintendo as sort of the traditionalist in how social should be and the fact that they actually want to get people together in the same room

51:37.523 --> 51:39.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing in-person gaming.

51:39.944 --> 51:43.144
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it almost seems to me that they've got an agenda to encourage that.

51:44.465 --> 51:45.985
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.

51:46.025 --> 51:48.346
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see them changing off of that anytime really soon.

51:49.286 --> 51:53.867
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to go back to, like, real quick, you know, because that does make sense that that may be their agenda.

51:53.907 --> 51:58.608
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you got to go to the movie Joe Dirt, where there's the guy with, you know, the firework stand.

51:58.868 --> 52:01.949
[SPEAKER_06]: And all he has is sparklers and those little snakes.

52:02.990 --> 52:24.271
[SPEAKER_06]: and he's like but that's what I like but you can't just think about what you like or what your focus may be you have to think about other people out there I understand that may be the focus that you want people to game in the room but you know what would be awesome too is say you want to have that gaming experience but you can't get your friends over you know say that you know they're gone somewhere and you want to play with them anyways think about all the options

52:24.891 --> 52:28.974
[SPEAKER_08]: Koopa Kid Jeremy in our chatroom says, keep grandma off the internet.

52:29.294 --> 52:32.396
[SPEAKER_08]: Old people opening 90 tabs, all of them yahoo.com.

52:33.737 --> 52:35.919
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, why did your friend Billy send me this link?

52:35.979 --> 52:37.980
[SPEAKER_08]: What is two girls, one cup?

52:38.080 --> 52:38.720
[SPEAKER_08]: What is this?

52:38.760 --> 52:40.021
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's actually hilarious?

52:40.582 --> 52:44.484
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's grandmother is super into the internet.

52:44.524 --> 52:45.425
[SPEAKER_03]: She does her genealogy.

52:46.425 --> 52:47.065
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's my dad.

52:47.085 --> 52:47.665
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my dad.

52:48.026 --> 52:48.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.

52:48.266 --> 52:58.128
[SPEAKER_03]: She's probably one of the most computer literate people in her age group that did not start off in programming or engineering that I know.

52:58.768 --> 53:00.248
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty neat to watch her.

53:00.308 --> 53:06.390
[SPEAKER_03]: However, my maternal grandmother, she will like poke around a little bit and maybe look at Facebook and then that's it.

53:06.930 --> 53:09.750
[SPEAKER_03]: My granny's like, no, those things, I don't want to look at them.

53:10.971 --> 53:12.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Your daddy's going to mess with that, not me.

53:13.342 --> 53:14.842
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Kathy Griffin and Cher And Anderson Cooper

53:40.131 --> 53:41.272
[SPEAKER_08]: They all need to do a buddy comedy.

53:41.592 --> 53:46.655
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we have distanced ourselves way away from the original topic, which means next topic, DarkSakura.

53:47.516 --> 53:48.577
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, it's my turn, isn't it?

53:49.938 --> 53:51.319
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it, Rob, making me work.

53:52.239 --> 53:54.441
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a little game called Fire Emblem.

53:55.561 --> 53:59.244
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is actually for Fire Emblem.

53:59.884 --> 54:03.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire Emblem Awakening Summer Scramble is the new DLC.

54:04.187 --> 54:07.810
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out in North America and Europe, but they have censored a scene

54:08.770 --> 54:14.874
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a character named Tharja who, I guess she's like pulling at her underwear or something or pulling it up.

54:15.554 --> 54:27.941
[SPEAKER_03]: But the edit that they made to it makes it even worse because there's like a piece of cloth now, like a curtain or something that's flowed in between where her butt is.

54:28.441 --> 54:34.365
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all you see is like, if you weren't looking for the little strap on the side, it would look like she's got her hands in her ass.

54:34.385 --> 54:34.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

54:35.718 --> 54:37.359
[SPEAKER_03]: She's digging her fingers in.

54:37.900 --> 54:39.261
[SPEAKER_08]: She's self-muppeting.

54:41.143 --> 54:42.324
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

54:42.464 --> 54:44.225
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to work on more conversations.

54:44.645 --> 54:45.766
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that on Urban Dictionary?

54:47.167 --> 54:47.848
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be, though.

54:48.869 --> 54:49.690
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, it's just...

54:52.398 --> 54:58.923
[SPEAKER_03]: The only, okay, and this is my big thing about censorship, is that the only reason this shit's a big deal is because you make it a fucking big deal.

54:59.523 --> 55:06.949
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like the approach I take to, quote, foul language around kids.

55:07.989 --> 55:12.412
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you're not supposed to say the words, that's just going to make it all the more attractive to say it, you know.

55:12.953 --> 55:15.755
[SPEAKER_03]: If you act like it's not a big deal, to them, it's not a big deal.

55:16.616 --> 55:21.099
[SPEAKER_03]: Same goes with, you know, censorship of, you know, a woman pulling up her underwear.

55:22.757 --> 55:24.838
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that they edited this... It's a bathing suit.

55:25.078 --> 55:25.819
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

55:27.380 --> 55:27.980
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

55:28.200 --> 55:36.885
[SPEAKER_03]: What they did to this, it just makes it look even worse because when you give somebody a clear concrete picture, it leaves a little room to the imagination.

55:37.245 --> 55:38.066
[SPEAKER_08]: Like black bars.

55:38.366 --> 55:38.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

55:39.067 --> 55:40.087
[SPEAKER_08]: We did this in college.

55:41.108 --> 55:46.691
[SPEAKER_08]: We were making a music video and we had the guy stand out in just a pair of gym shorts.

55:47.091 --> 55:51.094
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we did the movie, we put a black bar over it because it was supposed to be the girls...

55:52.234 --> 55:53.395
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I talking about this on the show?

55:53.436 --> 55:58.901
[SPEAKER_08]: We did like a Spice Girls music video for a college project and at the end of the video the girls Shut up!

55:59.282 --> 56:04.387
[SPEAKER_08]: The girls steal his clothes and so at the end he's just standing there with a black bar over it.

56:04.407 --> 56:09.132
[SPEAKER_08]: Well he didn't get naked for us he was wearing gym shorts and we put the black bar over it and it looked like he was naked!

56:09.572 --> 56:10.653
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an illusion!

56:11.113 --> 56:14.296
[SPEAKER_08]: And your pervy little minds don't think, oh, he's wearing gym shorts.

56:14.336 --> 56:17.918
[SPEAKER_08]: They think, oh, they had to block his penis.

56:17.958 --> 56:23.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's like you can also... Here's a good example of the Austin Powers movie, the first one.

56:23.803 --> 56:24.823
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God, yes.

56:24.883 --> 56:25.604
[SPEAKER_08]: With the cantaloupe.

56:25.624 --> 56:26.525
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:26.545 --> 56:31.088
[SPEAKER_03]: But she had, like, red pasties over the jumblies.

56:32.229 --> 56:33.410
[SPEAKER_03]: To steal Mystique's word.

56:33.970 --> 56:34.070
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

56:35.211 --> 56:44.540
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, when you take away the concrete image and you put just something in front of it, it's going to leave a lot more to the imagination.

56:44.640 --> 56:55.350
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the end, I think it's going to, you know, probably be more unintentionally explicit.

56:55.610 --> 56:59.433
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the brain, if it can be porned, the brain will porn it.

56:59.453 --> 56:59.874
Yeah.

57:01.241 --> 57:08.547
[SPEAKER_06]: and two, since I worked in a classy reference to Joe Dirt in the last topic, I'm going to reference Bioshock Infinite in this one.

57:08.847 --> 57:12.730
[SPEAKER_06]: The mind of the subject will desperately struggle to create memories where none exist.

57:12.750 --> 57:17.093
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, they will undress the bitch when they can't see her clothes.

57:18.734 --> 57:19.735
[SPEAKER_06]: And also think of the children.

57:19.995 --> 57:20.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Think of the children.

57:23.496 --> 57:25.217
[SPEAKER_08]: How many children are playing Fire Emblem?

57:25.257 --> 57:27.078
[SPEAKER_08]: How many children can understand Fire Emblem?

57:27.098 --> 57:27.859
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 3DS game.

57:28.119 --> 57:29.940
[SPEAKER_08]: All of the children are playing Fire Emblem.

57:31.081 --> 57:33.523
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I say that and then I'm like, oh, wait a minute, Rob.

57:33.543 --> 57:37.005
[SPEAKER_08]: When you were 10, you were totally playing Final Fantasy.

57:37.986 --> 57:42.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another fun example because Prince Brightstar mentioned the black bars in Japan.

57:42.849 --> 57:50.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when we got Final Fuck X and it was all squared out, the pixelated?

57:50.034 --> 57:52.075
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, we know that's badge.

57:55.818 --> 57:58.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we need to switch topics stat, Loki.

57:58.540 --> 58:00.262
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, that was entirely hilarious.

58:01.703 --> 58:02.964
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just cosplay porn.

58:02.984 --> 58:06.708
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there wasn't even any male characters that were dressed up like Final Fantasy characters.

58:06.788 --> 58:07.889
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good cosplay, though.

58:09.290 --> 58:09.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

58:11.412 --> 58:16.316
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so there was a game that came out called Scribblenauts Unlimited.

58:17.680 --> 58:19.342
[SPEAKER_06]: And they keep adding stuff each year.

58:19.442 --> 58:21.544
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this year they added some memes.

58:22.285 --> 58:29.713
[SPEAKER_06]: And to go along with that, Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat were some of the characters featured in the game.

58:30.554 --> 58:31.155
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what?

58:31.275 --> 58:32.216
[SPEAKER_06]: They're copyrighted.

58:32.476 --> 58:39.464
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently Fifth Cell or Warner Brothers didn't really give a shit or just were blatantly unaware that things get copyrighted on the internet and that kind of stuff.

58:40.064 --> 58:41.546
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

58:41.886 --> 58:47.053
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, the creators of those two properties are a little pissed off.

58:47.433 --> 58:48.875
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have filed a lawsuit.

58:49.856 --> 58:56.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, apparently, neither Fifth Cell or Warner Brothers were even acknowledging it.

58:56.344 --> 58:57.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of like, eh.

58:59.984 --> 59:22.079
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know they it's just some internet kids and you know they do um you know they obviously they do support the fact that people make things on the internet for non-profit stuff and that's fine but this is clearly for profit it was something that they advertised the game saying hey look Nandcat's in there and Keyboard Cat you should buy this game and people like oh cool I'm gonna buy the game because of that

59:24.362 --> 59:28.304
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just like the Nintendo version had Mario and Luigi in it, and they had to work out that deal with Nintendo.

59:28.324 --> 59:30.285
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they're not in the PC version, right?

59:30.705 --> 59:31.305
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very similar.

59:32.145 --> 59:33.946
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of think a lot of this is ignorance.

59:35.227 --> 59:37.748
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think the developers meant to do this maliciously.

59:37.768 --> 59:38.788
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think that's even malicious.

59:38.948 --> 59:42.529
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they just thought, oh, Nyan Cat's like this 4chan thing.

59:42.569 --> 59:45.110
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody really owns it, so let's just lift it.

59:45.430 --> 59:46.650
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be funny for our game.

59:47.330 --> 59:58.813
[SPEAKER_08]: But now that WB, the parent company, is not returning these guys' phone calls, who, yeah, it is a trademark thing or whatever, now they're pissed off, and this is their warning shot to get noticed.

59:59.133 --> 01:00:01.114
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll get settled out of court, as these things always do.

01:00:02.074 --> 01:00:03.295
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:28.031
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... And Keyboard Cat's a little trickier.

01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:30.732
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of think that's just thrown in for good measure.

01:00:30.952 --> 01:00:35.933
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that has quite the legal... Well, they also have Long Cat and stuff, I think, are in the game.

01:00:36.193 --> 01:00:37.514
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think anybody owns Long Cat.

01:00:37.534 --> 01:00:39.154
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.

01:00:39.754 --> 01:00:42.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I want to know if My Body is Ready is in there.

01:00:44.216 --> 01:00:50.578
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what that does... My Body is Ready is not a noun, though, so... Did I say a noun?

01:00:50.638 --> 01:00:51.118
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I did.

01:00:51.138 --> 01:00:51.878
[SPEAKER_08]: Neon.

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:52.138
[SPEAKER_08]: Neon.

01:00:56.390 --> 01:01:04.035
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there are a number of memes out there that are under copyright.

01:01:04.615 --> 01:01:09.878
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that they're well within their right to pursue action.

01:01:10.438 --> 01:01:15.741
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially, I really, and this is maybe just a guilty pleasure.

01:01:16.342 --> 01:01:18.463
[SPEAKER_03]: I love seeing the big companies taken down a notch.

01:01:19.011 --> 01:01:19.231
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:22.636
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's a lot of people quick to defend Scribblenauts and stuff.

01:01:22.676 --> 01:01:26.122
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not that I'm anti-Scribblenauts or I want to see Scribblenauts.

01:01:26.242 --> 01:01:27.343
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I love Scribblenauts.

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:28.585
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cute game and so forth.

01:01:28.705 --> 01:01:32.791
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also like the internet culture and a lot of what the internet brings up.

01:01:32.871 --> 01:01:33.332
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually...

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.182
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of these meme things, I really like to see how it turns around some people's lives.

01:01:38.202 --> 01:01:42.243
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about that chick, Ain't Nobody Got Time For That, when she was on the local news.

01:01:43.244 --> 01:01:45.165
[SPEAKER_08]: She's got commercial deals now.

01:01:45.245 --> 01:01:46.725
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Antoine.

01:01:47.085 --> 01:01:50.147
[SPEAKER_08]: That guy, there was a really interesting development with him this week.

01:01:50.367 --> 01:01:54.248
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, for all practical purposes, he did a lot with his stuff too.

01:01:54.308 --> 01:01:57.090
[SPEAKER_08]: They're clamming in your windows, they're snatching people up.

01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:02.952
[SPEAKER_08]: They milk their 15 minutes of fame, and it ends up being a happy ending of sorts.

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.154
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think that Queen Simeon and Chad is right.

01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:07.715
[SPEAKER_03]: Keyboard Cat is copyrighted or trademarked.

01:02:07.916 --> 01:02:08.156
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:02:08.196 --> 01:02:15.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, well, the guy, actually, I remember watching an interview where he licensed out his cat's likeness for the pistachio commercial.

01:02:16.021 --> 01:02:16.222
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

01:02:16.962 --> 01:02:21.766
[SPEAKER_08]: But the cat in Scribblenauts doesn't really look like it, like Nyan Cat does.

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:26.269
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be considered enough derivative, but I think copyright laws, what, 50% change?

01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:28.871
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that would be the harder one to prove.

01:02:28.891 --> 01:02:31.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and also the fact that you sum it by typing Keyboard Cat.

01:02:33.846 --> 01:02:34.346
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

01:02:34.366 --> 01:02:38.009
[SPEAKER_08]: But one could argue, well, it is a cat at the keyboard.

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.570
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:02:39.591 --> 01:02:41.072
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a cat that's neon.

01:02:42.573 --> 01:02:44.175
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want my body as ready to be in there.

01:02:45.253 --> 01:02:46.014
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a noun.

01:02:46.634 --> 01:02:49.036
[SPEAKER_08]: Reggie Fils-Aimé could be in there in the Nintendo version.

01:02:49.496 --> 01:02:52.458
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet if you type that in, the only thing that happens is his jaw comes out.

01:02:52.818 --> 01:02:54.279
[SPEAKER_08]: The game just punches you in the face.

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:55.000
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what happens.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Or starts printing money.

01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:59.263
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, 4chan the game.

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:00.524
[SPEAKER_08]: Ain't nobody got time for that.

01:03:00.924 --> 01:03:05.247
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that's what Scribblenauts kind of like was its big selling point, was that it had all these memes in it.

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:08.129
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, those stupid guys that were sitting behind us at the baseball game?

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:09.791
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, foul ball!

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:11.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't nobody got time for that!

01:03:11.232 --> 01:03:11.572
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:03:12.092 --> 01:03:12.972
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

01:03:34.617 --> 01:03:35.719
[SPEAKER_08]: Greenheart Games is the folks behind it.

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:58.851
[SPEAKER_08]: And they did this interesting thing to kind of combat piracy, which I guess was some type of experiment or whatever.

01:03:59.391 --> 01:04:09.974
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they did is they put up a copy of the game on one of the big torrent sites and with a little info file that you'd see with most cracked games that says, you know, fully cracked, playable, da da da.

01:04:10.574 --> 01:04:20.416
[SPEAKER_08]: But in an old throwback to, let's say, the Earthbound pirate copies of many years ago, it would change the game significantly to make it unbeatable.

01:04:20.876 --> 01:04:22.157
[SPEAKER_08]: How does it change the game?

01:04:22.698 --> 01:04:27.702
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, at some point, piracy starts taking over your game development office.

01:04:27.962 --> 01:04:36.269
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll get a little message that pops up on the screen that says, It seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally.

01:04:36.689 --> 01:04:40.372
[SPEAKER_08]: If players don't buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.

01:04:40.452 --> 01:04:41.893
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to click on a little frown to continue.

01:04:42.173 --> 01:04:43.815
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't beat the game at this point.

01:04:45.016 --> 01:05:08.218
[SPEAKER_08]: and of course it has all these people posting on internet forums about it like how do I get the piracy to stop in the game which is just giving away how many people were pirating it very similar as well to didn't they do this with Arkham Asylum not City but Asylum they had like a whole thing where Batman couldn't make a certain jump and people were posting on forums about this and WB just went ban ban ban ban because these were all the people

01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:09.919
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they were pirating it.

01:05:10.099 --> 01:05:20.402
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, this guy was collecting anonymous usage statistics and found that it was, what, over 90% of the copies of this being played were pirated.

01:05:21.402 --> 01:05:21.962
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy.

01:05:22.622 --> 01:05:31.524
[SPEAKER_06]: But were those people going to actually play the game legitimately in the first place or did they just find it when they were browsing new games that are added to the Pirate Bay?

01:05:31.784 --> 01:05:37.926
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he put it out there himself on the Pirate Bay and people were downloading it.

01:05:38.466 --> 01:05:48.534
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's not forget that other indie companies have put out their game on the Pirate Bay to drive up interest in the game and to, you know, get people to test the game out.

01:05:49.295 --> 01:06:00.143
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's my thing is, I wonder, I'm not saying someone could fuse that for this, I'm sure that people are just pirating, but you can't attribute, if you didn't do that...

01:06:01.164 --> 01:06:01.825
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:06:16.824 --> 01:06:18.505
[SPEAKER_06]: And now all these people are writing stories about it.

01:06:18.886 --> 01:06:20.387
[SPEAKER_06]: And now he has a legit version out there.

01:06:20.447 --> 01:06:22.408
[SPEAKER_06]: And now everyone's like, oh, we've got to support the Indies.

01:06:22.428 --> 01:06:25.590
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go buy this game, even though you may or may not want to play it.

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:33.336
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, either way you slice this pie, Loki, whether you want to say it was the piracy mechanism or the exposure, genius move.

01:06:35.498 --> 01:06:41.442
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter which way you slice it, whatever angle they were... Either it was a genius anti-piracy scheme or it was a genius marketing scheme.

01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:48.547
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not very honest in the fact that, you know, basically they're... It's kind of like, I wouldn't say like entrapment almost.

01:06:48.707 --> 01:06:53.051
[SPEAKER_08]: The irony of you saying entrapping pirates is not very honest.

01:06:53.311 --> 01:06:54.111
[SPEAKER_08]: The irony.

01:06:54.351 --> 01:06:55.032
[SPEAKER_08]: It hurts.

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:56.133
[SPEAKER_08]: It's burning.

01:06:57.073 --> 01:06:58.855
[SPEAKER_06]: I need ice cubes.

01:06:59.055 --> 01:07:03.278
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel less sorry about a company that puts their game up there by themselves...

01:07:03.938 --> 01:07:06.299
[SPEAKER_06]: versus a game getting leaked to the internet.

01:07:06.639 --> 01:07:07.719
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you going to say, Jamie?

01:07:07.759 --> 01:07:08.819
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I had to make my point.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.421
[SPEAKER_03]: Breakman was saying using Pirate Bay as your game testers.

01:07:14.981 --> 01:07:17.902
[SPEAKER_08]: It does end up being kind of like a demo of sorts.

01:07:17.922 --> 01:07:22.463
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, cool.

01:07:22.663 --> 01:07:24.724
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, cool that people are checking out the game.

01:07:26.328 --> 01:07:29.070
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that's what they wanted in the end, and hopefully it works out for them.

01:07:30.812 --> 01:07:32.273
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally am not going to pick up this game.

01:07:32.573 --> 01:07:40.359
[SPEAKER_06]: It may have been, you know, the fact that it's compared to Game Dev Story, it's a little similar to that, might be intriguing, but after what they did, fuck them.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.440
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not buying it.

01:07:41.821 --> 01:07:42.641
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not playing it either.

01:07:42.661 --> 01:07:45.203
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are personally offended by this little move?

01:07:45.223 --> 01:07:46.384
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it's shady.

01:07:46.484 --> 01:07:47.385
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so shady.

01:07:47.665 --> 01:07:48.566
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, like...

01:07:49.967 --> 01:07:53.710
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a difference between... But the Pirate Bay is shady.

01:07:53.930 --> 01:08:02.777
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a difference between putting something in your game, you know, like the Michael Jackson game on DS.

01:08:02.877 --> 01:08:03.738
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the Vuvuzela thing.

01:08:03.758 --> 01:08:04.899
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody just brought that up in chat.

01:08:05.119 --> 01:08:06.440
[SPEAKER_06]: Or like Batman stuff.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.862
[SPEAKER_06]: Programming a little thing in there to catch pirates when the game gets leaked out.

01:08:10.643 --> 01:08:11.664
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's something.

01:08:11.804 --> 01:08:14.286
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool that they've got that in there and you can catch people doing it.

01:08:14.626 --> 01:08:18.469
[SPEAKER_06]: But the fact that you go, Oh, we're going to show these pirates.

01:08:18.489 --> 01:08:19.410
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to upload our own...

01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:20.811
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on, that's stupid.

01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:26.234
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like saying, oh, I'm going to open up my house and I'm going to say, hey, come steal my shit.

01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:28.615
[SPEAKER_06]: And then get pissed off that people are stealing my shit.

01:08:29.636 --> 01:08:31.077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, that's just stupid.

01:08:31.657 --> 01:08:32.177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid.

01:08:32.257 --> 01:08:34.559
[SPEAKER_06]: And you think you're going to teach these people moral?

01:08:34.799 --> 01:08:41.583
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those things like, to say that this is going to work in getting people to buy your game is just like those stupid advertisements before.

01:08:41.923 --> 01:08:43.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about the lighting rig people.

01:08:43.924 --> 01:08:46.966
[SPEAKER_06]: They're out of jobs because you pirate your movies.

01:08:48.567 --> 01:08:50.248
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, it's just stupid.

01:08:50.588 --> 01:09:01.134
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's say we're about ready to put out a CD of exclusive Orange Lounge Radio material and things that, you know, never before heard on the show and that's how we're going to pay for our hosting for the next year.

01:09:01.194 --> 01:09:02.214
[SPEAKER_08]: Hypothetical situation.

01:09:02.594 --> 01:09:10.719
[SPEAKER_08]: How do I make sure that that CD does not get pirated without possibly offending the pirates out there in the world?

01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:11.399
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.121
[SPEAKER_06]: It's music.

01:09:14.141 --> 01:09:14.941
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to be able to.

01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:16.362
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no DRM that you can put on that.

01:09:16.716 --> 01:09:18.760
[SPEAKER_08]: So, bend over and take it.

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:19.582
[SPEAKER_08]: And enjoy it.

01:09:21.025 --> 01:09:25.173
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it out there for free yourself and just hope they'll rally behind you because you're one of them.

01:09:26.718 --> 01:09:27.879
[SPEAKER_06]: Most likely, here's the thing.

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:32.462
[SPEAKER_06]: The situation with that is you're not going to have a whole lot of interest in people putting it up.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:42.347
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to leak it out there because they just don't... They figure that if there's no interest in trying to get the game, they're not going to necessarily put it out there or the content.

01:09:42.728 --> 01:09:48.771
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for example, I can't find copies of maybe somebody VHS recording...

01:09:50.012 --> 01:09:51.353
[SPEAKER_06]: episodes of Being Bobby Brown.

01:09:51.674 --> 01:09:53.375
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just not on the internet at all.

01:09:53.575 --> 01:10:00.062
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife is wanting me to search high and low and I will until the day I die to find copies of that.

01:10:00.482 --> 01:10:01.383
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just not up there.

01:10:01.403 --> 01:10:05.767
[SPEAKER_08]: For Being Bobby Brown, I will endorse piracy because everybody has to see that.

01:10:05.947 --> 01:10:06.447
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby!

01:10:07.428 --> 01:10:13.612
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic, but Whitney was a bitch and she fucking had her lawyers take all that shit down.

01:10:13.632 --> 01:10:15.533
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means babe in total control of herself.

01:10:15.553 --> 01:10:15.953
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:10:16.573 --> 01:10:21.056
[SPEAKER_06]: And she had everybody take the copies off the internet.

01:10:21.076 --> 01:10:23.978
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the clips, too, are just gone.

01:10:24.478 --> 01:10:26.879
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unfortunately, there's that.

01:10:26.979 --> 01:10:29.901
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just don't think anyone would pirate our CD.

01:10:30.081 --> 01:10:33.983
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure, they could leak it out there, but is anyone really going to care to download it?

01:10:34.243 --> 01:10:34.443
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:10:36.005 --> 01:10:45.293
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe my example about music was a bad one, but when it comes to games, you had Tim here on the show last night whose job is in the industry making games like Tomb Raider.

01:10:45.993 --> 01:10:54.541
[SPEAKER_08]: What is an effective DRM strategy that we can do to make sure that as many games as possible sell legitimately so people like Tim can continue to be employed?

01:10:54.901 --> 01:10:55.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Free-to-play.

01:10:55.681 --> 01:10:58.743
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you basically... Everything's gotta go free-to-play.

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:00.724
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's gotta go free-to-play.

01:11:01.004 --> 01:11:08.267
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not saying free-to-play to the point of, you know... It doesn't have to necessarily be free-to-play, like cheap-to-play, I guess.

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:11.469
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like $10 games with a ton of DLC.

01:11:11.629 --> 01:11:17.451
[SPEAKER_06]: DLC that makes sense, not just, oh, you're out of energy points, you gotta buy some DLC to be able to play this game longer.

01:11:17.831 --> 01:11:20.993
[SPEAKER_06]: Not anything retarded like that, but actually supported DLC.

01:11:21.653 --> 01:11:27.016
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, the game might be shorter because it's more of a demo, but that's what I'm saying.

01:11:27.076 --> 01:11:28.916
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically you get a small amount of content.

01:11:28.997 --> 01:11:36.600
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, Ridge Racer for the Vita would have worked perfectly like that, except they charged $40 for it, or $30 for four tracks.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.240
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:42.103
[SPEAKER_06]: If they put it out for like $5 or $10, probably like $5 would be perfect.

01:11:42.203 --> 01:11:43.483
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby's retort in chat.

01:11:43.563 --> 01:11:44.084
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fair one.

01:11:44.104 --> 01:11:44.904
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to put it out there.

01:11:45.064 --> 01:11:46.905
[SPEAKER_08]: This was an $8 game, and it was still pirated.

01:11:48.226 --> 01:11:48.847
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a game.

01:11:50.988 --> 01:11:51.509
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that.

01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:55.372
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be an $8 game, but once again, they put it out there first.

01:11:55.392 --> 01:11:58.254
[SPEAKER_06]: They put it out there.

01:11:58.334 --> 01:12:01.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Would an $8 game be leaked that quickly?

01:12:01.636 --> 01:12:02.337
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the question.

01:12:03.238 --> 01:12:06.140
[SPEAKER_06]: How quickly would an $8 indie game be leaked out to the internet?

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.382
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people who leak games just because they can.

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:10.883
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that they can.

01:12:10.903 --> 01:12:16.346
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's DRM on it, I'm assuming it's DRM free, but let's assume that there was DRM on it.

01:12:16.446 --> 01:12:21.308
[SPEAKER_06]: Would really someone spend the time to crack this game and put it out there?

01:12:21.428 --> 01:12:23.870
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure, there's probably somebody out there that would do it.

01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:29.193
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know if it's going to have as big of a draw once now it's all controversial.

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:30.473
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Steam so much.

01:12:30.493 --> 01:12:30.693
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:00.515
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the thing.

01:13:00.836 --> 01:13:07.497
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to find that balance between how much do I charge for it and make sure enough people buy it so that I recoup my cost.

01:13:07.537 --> 01:13:11.558
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems also double-edged sword, too, because now there's games that come out on PC.

01:13:11.658 --> 01:13:16.339
[SPEAKER_06]: I might think of buying Bioshock Infinite on PC as well as on 360.

01:13:16.379 --> 01:13:21.041
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I already have the 360 version, but I may buy it on PC.

01:13:21.161 --> 01:13:22.601
[SPEAKER_06]: But am I going to pay full price for it?

01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:34.410
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck no, I'm gonna wait for a sale because they have sales all the damn time on Steam, on Amazon, on Green Man Gaming, on Gamefly with Steam DRM, on, you know, wherever.

01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:38.433
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna find these games for, you know, marked down to, like, nothing.

01:13:39.153 --> 01:13:43.196
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the kind of mentality, I mean, look at Tomb Raider, it was just half price.

01:13:43.376 --> 01:13:45.558
[SPEAKER_06]: That came out, like, two months ago?

01:13:45.878 --> 01:13:46.378
[SPEAKER_06]: A month ago?

01:13:46.398 --> 01:13:46.478
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.404
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, shit, you can't do this with console games.

01:13:50.944 --> 01:13:52.186
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not dropping that fast.

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:56.031
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to be five bucks one day and then next day... Well, some do.

01:13:56.833 --> 01:14:01.139
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, some do, but I'm talking about Tomb Raider, a game that sold quite a bit.

01:14:01.379 --> 01:14:03.522
[SPEAKER_06]: It was totally not a disappointment to anybody, but I'm...

01:14:05.204 --> 01:14:07.985
[SPEAKER_08]: GameGuru in chat says, well, I believe DRM is rather stupid.

01:14:08.306 --> 01:14:11.008
[SPEAKER_08]: What the game dev tycoon guys did was actually pretty clever.

01:14:12.509 --> 01:14:16.391
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakman says, dev equal, I'll give you $20 to go buy this $10 game.

01:14:16.471 --> 01:14:17.592
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki equal, fuck that.

01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:18.953
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I'll have to go out of my way.

01:14:18.973 --> 01:14:19.814
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to pirate it.

01:14:22.615 --> 01:14:23.956
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't pirate games anymore.

01:14:25.718 --> 01:14:27.639
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't pirate games to, you know,

01:14:29.096 --> 01:14:31.077
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe to play them early and then buy the game.

01:14:31.097 --> 01:14:32.278
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't pirate them any less?

01:14:32.818 --> 01:14:34.038
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I don't pirate them any less.

01:14:34.419 --> 01:14:38.521
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't pirate PC games anymore, for sure.

01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:41.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe to play them a little early, yes.

01:14:41.942 --> 01:14:42.883
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do buy them always.

01:14:44.534 --> 01:14:45.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

01:14:59.565 --> 01:15:08.630
[SPEAKER_06]: But if a game gets leaked out that's supposed to be out in a couple months, and I can play it way early, I'm all about playing games as soon as I can.

01:15:09.150 --> 01:15:15.013
[SPEAKER_06]: If Grand Theft Auto 5 gets leaked out tomorrow, you better believe I'm going to find a way to get it.

01:15:15.554 --> 01:15:17.975
[SPEAKER_06]: But you better believe I'm going to be buying it when it comes out.

01:15:18.095 --> 01:15:18.776
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:39.476
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:15:55.373 --> 01:16:19.126
[SPEAKER_06]: that was a hack on Uplay but there are some other stuff that gets leaked out I think from duplicators or game you know they go to retail early because they street date stuff and they ship to the retailer like a week early and so then that gets leaked out by some employee but then there's like the Microsoft games that come out a month ahead time and I'm assuming that's duplicators because I can't see how the hell it could leak any earlier than that

01:16:19.466 --> 01:16:21.486
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm sure we'll get some emails on this at a later date.

01:16:21.967 --> 01:16:35.109
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, mailbag at orangeonsradio.com I do actually want to say there's been a couple cases where I've downloaded PC games through a torrent site because the servers were down for the actual site and I had a key to play it.

01:16:35.729 --> 01:16:36.149
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

01:16:36.609 --> 01:16:40.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, especially if you play Ragnarok online, sometimes it's the only way to get it.

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.931
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on with more news.

01:16:42.951 --> 01:16:44.291
[SPEAKER_08]: We're running long, so DarkSakura.

01:16:45.737 --> 01:16:46.998
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let me get it.

01:16:47.699 --> 01:16:56.967
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there is, for people who are fans of Eternal Darkness, there is a spiritual successor called Shadow of the Eternals that's been announced.

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:12.880
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, there's already a bunch of information out on it saying that it's going to be out on PC and Wii U and that they are trying to score 1.5 million to fund the game.

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:18.273
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's going to be interesting.

01:17:19.814 --> 01:17:25.237
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm not seeing is if it's a Kickstarter or not out yet for that.

01:17:25.317 --> 01:17:31.281
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are wanting to do it episodic and have it out by Q3 2014.

01:17:31.381 --> 01:17:31.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

01:17:31.942 --> 01:17:32.142
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:41.322
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people I know on Twitter are not big fans of this idea.

01:17:41.542 --> 01:17:47.805
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as Eternal Darkness was awesome, apparently the guy who made it, Dennis Dyack, hasn't made a lot of winners.

01:17:48.306 --> 01:17:50.207
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're not sure if this is something worth supporting.

01:17:50.307 --> 01:17:51.327
[SPEAKER_08]: But he'll get the money.

01:17:51.447 --> 01:17:58.872
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it looks like it's going to be produced through Precursor Games.

01:17:59.812 --> 01:18:01.353
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Canadian group.

01:18:01.933 --> 01:18:03.154
[SPEAKER_03]: Good games are coming out of Canada.

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:10.743
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming a little bit sooner than things that are getting kick-started right now.

01:18:11.244 --> 01:18:12.384
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, start us off with the U.S.

01:18:12.585 --> 01:18:13.645
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing coming up this week.

01:18:15.507 --> 01:18:16.407
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, nothing.

01:18:17.408 --> 01:18:17.688
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:18.429
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

01:18:18.809 --> 01:18:19.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a damn thing?

01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:26.154
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing until the 14th, and 14th will be Metro 20, or not 23, Metro Last Light on the 14th.

01:18:26.274 --> 01:18:26.714
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that?

01:18:26.774 --> 01:18:28.596
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that just because it's a slow time of year?

01:18:28.836 --> 01:18:30.657
[SPEAKER_08]: They figure everybody's seeing Iron Man?

01:18:30.797 --> 01:18:32.839
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a slow time of the year, usually.

01:18:33.099 --> 01:18:41.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually there's still quite a few releases coming out, but I think we're getting that pre-console launch lull, and so we don't have a lot of games coming out.

01:18:41.945 --> 01:18:49.390
[SPEAKER_06]: There was supposed to be the Wii U version of Deus Ex Human Revolution, but that is now TBA, so...

01:18:51.031 --> 01:18:51.451
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

01:19:08.397 --> 01:19:09.538
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:19:30.927 --> 01:19:36.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Week is actually, from what I understand, kind of hard to sell anything because nobody's there.

01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:39.470
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Week is when you go home to visit your family.

01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:42.951
[SPEAKER_03]: This week would be, I think, a lot busier for sales.

01:19:44.132 --> 01:19:45.272
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:19:45.512 --> 01:19:48.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have a very few things in the UK.

01:19:48.774 --> 01:19:58.477
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 9th, we have Sid Meier's Ace Patrol, and the 10th, Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut for Wii U, and Persona 4, the ultimate in Mayonaka Arena.

01:19:59.844 --> 01:20:02.285
[SPEAKER_03]: for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:20:02.625 --> 01:20:05.306
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure our buddy Magi is very happy about that.

01:20:05.826 --> 01:20:07.427
[SPEAKER_03]: As he told me earlier that he was happy.

01:20:07.607 --> 01:20:10.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he said after he wrote us that letter that he found out it was coming out.

01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.349
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

01:20:12.729 --> 01:20:14.270
[SPEAKER_03]: And the new Shin Megami Tensei.

01:20:15.523 --> 01:20:16.643
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

01:20:38.869 --> 01:20:39.069
[SPEAKER_06]: Madden 25

01:20:56.974 --> 01:20:58.054
[SPEAKER_06]: Out this year, right?

01:20:58.615 --> 01:20:58.915
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 years.

01:20:59.415 --> 01:21:00.375
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 sequels to Madden.

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:00.835
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:21:01.676 --> 01:21:10.439
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've actually... I mean, there was... On one of the boxes, they even said... Credits him for the Madden games.

01:21:10.859 --> 01:21:13.620
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's just nothing.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.761
[SPEAKER_06]: No sort of royalties or anything.

01:21:15.801 --> 01:21:17.642
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though he was a co-creator of the series.

01:21:17.722 --> 01:21:17.862
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:20.170
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:21.611
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like he has a pretty strong case.

01:21:21.671 --> 01:21:24.053
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be interesting to see if it gets settled out of court or not.

01:21:24.393 --> 01:21:25.194
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it will.

01:21:25.314 --> 01:21:28.396
[SPEAKER_06]: It says it's going to trial, so you never know.

01:21:29.197 --> 01:21:30.117
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because it goes to trial.

01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:31.038
[SPEAKER_08]: First day of the trial.

01:21:31.198 --> 01:21:32.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he reached an agreement.

01:21:32.139 --> 01:21:32.559
[SPEAKER_07]: Go figure.

01:21:34.417 --> 01:21:36.118
[SPEAKER_08]: That happened to me once when I was on jury duty.

01:21:36.178 --> 01:21:39.299
[SPEAKER_08]: We were sitting in the little hallway waiting to go in the room.

01:21:39.399 --> 01:21:40.539
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even know what the case was about.

01:21:40.559 --> 01:21:41.820
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know if it was criminal, civil, what.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.541
[SPEAKER_08]: We're sitting in the hallway waiting to go in the room, and then we're sitting there for like an hour, an hour and a half.

01:21:46.681 --> 01:21:50.863
[SPEAKER_08]: They come out and say, oh, they just settled, so we're going to have you guys all go back to the jury room.

01:21:51.743 --> 01:21:52.823
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've had that happen before too.

01:21:52.863 --> 01:21:54.464
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, okay.

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:56.865
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a game of chicken.

01:21:57.905 --> 01:21:58.865
[SPEAKER_08]: How far are we going to go?

01:21:58.885 --> 01:22:00.126
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we actually going to get the jury in here?

01:22:00.346 --> 01:22:01.546
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, jury duty is great.

01:22:01.646 --> 01:22:03.127
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like your chance to sit and read a book.

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:05.069
[SPEAKER_08]: Jury duty is not so bad.

01:22:05.569 --> 01:22:09.712
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's just this particular county because here in Sacramento it's just one day or one child.

01:22:09.732 --> 01:22:12.254
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have really decent snacks in the cafeteria.

01:22:12.815 --> 01:22:14.096
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's super important.

01:22:14.436 --> 01:22:19.560
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a friend that was in our WoW guild because we were both on jury duty.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:29.413
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're sitting in the hallway freaking talking about our Draenei and how we were looking forward to seeing what the new expansion was and we're all so disappointed.

01:22:30.014 --> 01:22:30.354
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.

01:22:30.554 --> 01:22:35.101
[SPEAKER_08]: The last time I was on jury duty, I was playing...

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:43.707
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say it was Final Fantasy 4, the after years, but wasn't that only on Wii at the time?

01:22:43.927 --> 01:22:45.629
[SPEAKER_08]: So it must have just been Final Fantasy 4.

01:22:45.689 --> 01:22:47.550
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's when the DS cartridge came out.

01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:48.471
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet that's what it was.

01:22:48.491 --> 01:22:51.114
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was playing the crap out of that at jury duty.

01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:54.312
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember being so bored sitting at home.

01:22:55.073 --> 01:23:09.365
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't because I was actually working at that other place but I went in for my jury duty and it gave me a chance to read my book and get my stuff done and I sadly didn't get picked for a jury because I kind of wanted to be on one so I could have the people's court theme going in my head.

01:23:09.585 --> 01:23:11.446
[SPEAKER_08]: I sat on one in 2006.

01:23:11.846 --> 01:23:15.027
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on a nice long murder trial.

01:23:15.107 --> 01:23:16.167
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you don't.

01:23:16.227 --> 01:23:17.068
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful what you wish for.

01:23:17.088 --> 01:23:19.969
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on a two-week trial for a criminal case.

01:23:20.049 --> 01:23:23.790
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't murder, but it was very bad stuff.

01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:25.851
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I got to do my civic duty.

01:23:26.191 --> 01:23:28.892
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I got to see Law & Order play out in front of me.

01:23:28.972 --> 01:23:33.174
[SPEAKER_08]: The very animated prosecutor was awesome to watch.

01:23:33.214 --> 01:23:37.035
[SPEAKER_08]: She was great, but I never want to be on a trial like that again in my life.

01:23:38.356 --> 01:23:43.300
[SPEAKER_03]: But I actually don't mind the waiting for it just because it gives me a chance to read.

01:23:44.581 --> 01:23:45.982
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow, how do we get on jury duty?

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:49.605
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it must be... Video games and jury duty!

01:23:49.645 --> 01:23:53.108
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's legal week here on OLR because guess what my story is about?

01:23:53.368 --> 01:23:54.629
[SPEAKER_08]: Another lawsuit!

01:23:55.109 --> 01:24:00.413
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is one of those, oh, we must have seen this coming after all the internet rage about Mass Effect 3.

01:24:00.473 --> 01:24:01.874
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when somebody tried to sue there.

01:24:02.275 --> 01:24:04.116
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what game got targeted this time?

01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:04.997
[SPEAKER_08]: Alien Skyrim!

01:24:05.157 --> 01:24:34.937
[SPEAKER_08]: Colonial Marines, that's right Sega and Gearbox class action lawsuit against them saying you knowingly misrepresented Aliens Colonial Marines at trade show demos fascinating and a lot of people were bitching about this too like the game that came out did not match what they were showing at E3 and all this so but I don't know like can you sue a movie because the movie wasn't as good as the trailer and they put stuff in the trailer all the time that doesn't end up in the real movie

01:24:37.074 --> 01:24:37.594
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know though.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:44.719
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I would like, you know, the two hours of my life back for Mortal Kombat Resurrection or whatever the crap it was.

01:24:45.219 --> 01:24:47.540
[SPEAKER_03]: And I totally blame Jessica and Ross for making me watch that.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I blame Ross for making me watch that movie.

01:24:49.962 --> 01:24:56.365
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't go demand, you know, that people give me money or anything for a shitty movie.

01:24:57.766 --> 01:25:02.149
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I pretty much know shit anyway, but the trailers made it look a lot more interesting than it actually was.

01:25:02.169 --> 01:25:03.650
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the sequel to the first one.

01:25:03.670 --> 01:25:05.571
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually really boring and stupid.

01:25:06.141 --> 01:25:10.143
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow, TimeGate Studios, maybe they can see this coming.

01:25:10.203 --> 01:25:15.806
[SPEAKER_08]: The end is coming because, of course, they are the developer behind Aliens, Colonial Marines, co-developer.

01:25:16.226 --> 01:25:17.967
[SPEAKER_08]: And they also developed a game called Section 8.

01:25:18.567 --> 01:25:26.771
[SPEAKER_08]: They filed for bankruptcy protection at the Texas Southern Bankruptcy Court, apparently owing their creditors between $10 and $50 million in debt.

01:25:26.991 --> 01:25:28.352
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a hell of a price range.

01:25:28.372 --> 01:25:30.033
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very odd estimate.

01:25:30.373 --> 01:25:50.326
[SPEAKER_08]: but yeah, TimeGate seeking protection against creditors now granted they aren't the target of this lawsuit per se but yeah don't release a game as bad as Aliens Colonial Marines people because in this day and age you'll get sued over it how dare you waste my time

01:25:53.143 --> 01:25:54.704
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, $60 for a game.

01:25:55.024 --> 01:25:55.944
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big chunk of change.

01:25:56.064 --> 01:26:02.446
[SPEAKER_06]: And also they had, you know, all the media that was from it was from the, you know, pre-release thing.

01:26:02.526 --> 01:26:04.967
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was nothing like ads development goes.

01:26:05.507 --> 01:26:09.709
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hey, yeah, we had to scale back this stuff because it wouldn't run on a console.

01:26:10.529 --> 01:26:14.050
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, let's travel to a time when things were a lot simpler.

01:26:16.131 --> 01:26:16.991
[SPEAKER_08]: To the intro of our show.

01:26:17.011 --> 01:26:18.852
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a new theme back in the day.

01:26:18.932 --> 01:26:21.773
[SPEAKER_08]: When we first started the show this evening, before we started...

01:26:23.485 --> 01:26:24.809
[SPEAKER_06]: Long, long time ago.

01:26:24.989 --> 01:26:25.992
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple hours.

01:26:26.533 --> 01:26:31.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then, we weren't talking about Final Fuck X. We were just talking about, you know, blowjobs.

01:26:31.285 --> 01:26:31.706
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:26:37.073 --> 01:26:38.814
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the classic game of the week.

01:26:39.154 --> 01:26:45.717
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, back in the day, you would buy a game like, I don't know, what was it?

01:26:45.737 --> 01:26:46.117
[SPEAKER_08]: E.T.

01:26:46.197 --> 01:26:47.378
[SPEAKER_08]: What was a really terrible game?

01:26:47.398 --> 01:26:48.318
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, E.T.

01:26:48.338 --> 01:26:48.898
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?

01:26:49.298 --> 01:26:50.519
[SPEAKER_08]: You just got stuck with it.

01:26:50.579 --> 01:26:52.620
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no class action lawsuit because E.T.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:52.940
[SPEAKER_08]: sucked.

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:59.042
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura, go into the gaming vault and find a game that, hey, the kids should be playing this week.

01:26:59.102 --> 01:27:00.503
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the classic game of the week?

01:27:00.663 --> 01:27:06.167
[SPEAKER_03]: The Classic Game of the Week is Magical Chase for the PC Engine, also known as the TurboGrafx.

01:27:07.087 --> 01:27:12.171
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will tell you right now that this is one of the holy grails of the U.S.

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:19.396
[SPEAKER_03]: TurboDuo, sorry, TurboGrafx games, because they did like five copies in the U.S.,

01:27:21.637 --> 01:27:25.698
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I don't even, I would like a copy of this because it's actually a really neat little game.

01:27:26.779 --> 01:27:32.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Magical Chase was put out by Palsoft and released by Quest on the PC Engine.

01:27:33.221 --> 01:27:35.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Came out in 1991 in Japan and 93 in the US.

01:27:36.142 --> 01:27:39.763
[SPEAKER_03]: And you play as a little witch named Ripple who flies on a broomstick.

01:27:40.763 --> 01:27:43.204
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear I used to get this confused with Cotton back in the day for the record.

01:27:44.824 --> 01:27:45.705
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have...

01:27:46.545 --> 01:27:47.226
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Maidens Ingradius

01:28:04.049 --> 01:28:07.272
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's funny, the article even compares it to Cotton.

01:28:07.633 --> 01:28:09.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Success did Cotton, not Compiles.

01:28:12.057 --> 01:28:22.447
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was one of the last games that was released in the US for the TurboGrafx, TurboDuo, and had a ton of hype, and now it's like you'd be hard-pressed to find a copy.

01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:29.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, as you play through the game, you, uh, have, uh, normal and hard difficulty settings.

01:28:30.699 --> 01:28:34.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can only play, uh, the first three levels on easy.

01:28:34.985 --> 01:28:35.406
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh...

01:28:38.371 --> 01:28:42.954
[SPEAKER_03]: If once your enemies are destroyed, they leave gemstones behind, so that's your currency in games.

01:28:42.974 --> 01:28:48.478
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy power-ups, health, extra lives, except on the third and sixth levels, it only appears once.

01:28:49.758 --> 01:28:53.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Touching stuff on the ground does not kill you, but it does slow you down.

01:28:54.481 --> 01:28:57.703
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you get trapped behind objects, you get scrolling damage.

01:28:59.174 --> 01:29:01.475
[SPEAKER_03]: You have your different levels.

01:29:01.535 --> 01:29:13.260
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Cuboligon, Dodongren, Kamikaze Dangun, Fat Metal, which just sounds funny, Gemini Snow, and then the Sixth Seal.

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:16.021
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are other ports.

01:29:16.081 --> 01:29:16.942
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a...

01:29:18.783 --> 01:29:22.565
[SPEAKER_03]: version for Windows 95, 98 that came out in 1998.

01:29:23.205 --> 01:29:29.068
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they did Magical Chase GB for the Game Boy Color only in Japan on August 4th, 2000.

01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:32.670
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, it's rare.

01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:38.694
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I was about to eBay it just to see exactly if there's any copies on eBay right now.

01:29:39.754 --> 01:29:40.455
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's find out.

01:29:41.995 --> 01:29:43.796
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's honestly a cute little game.

01:29:43.836 --> 01:29:46.318
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that level because it looks like she's flying over Tetris blocks.

01:29:46.966 --> 01:29:48.828
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you trying to autocorrect me to chase?

01:30:12.714 --> 01:30:14.917
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you keep reading and I'll look it up real quick.

01:30:14.977 --> 01:30:16.039
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I got it right now.

01:30:16.981 --> 01:30:17.561
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want the dinner.

01:30:20.645 --> 01:30:32.354
[SPEAKER_03]: Magical Chase, PC Engine, the Japanese version, $229.80 Super Rare, NEC, PC Engine, HuCard This is still the Japanese version, $249.00 $199.00 Even the Game Boy Color version is going for $249.00 We have a Japanese soundtrack for $50.00

01:30:46.044 --> 01:30:46.625
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:31:08.723 --> 01:31:15.451
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a celebrity, a small internet celebrity, who would make puppy eyes at you until you give it to her.

01:31:16.552 --> 01:31:17.613
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Panorama Cotton.

01:31:17.713 --> 01:31:18.815
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are like on my list.

01:31:19.956 --> 01:31:29.146
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, to be honest, if I saw this and then I saw Radiant Silvergun right next to it to get for Dan, I think that I would do the right thing and get this for myself.

01:31:30.666 --> 01:31:31.227
[SPEAKER_08]: Good answer.

01:31:31.887 --> 01:31:32.388
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good answer.

01:31:32.408 --> 01:31:33.569
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I don't think Dan would follow me.

01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:34.290
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:31:35.371 --> 01:31:38.534
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Magical Chase, No Relation to Cotton.

01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:41.631
[SPEAKER_08]: But a small resemblance to Fantasy Zone.

01:31:41.771 --> 01:31:43.252
[SPEAKER_03]: But she doesn't go, Willow!

01:31:43.572 --> 01:31:44.813
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:31:44.893 --> 01:31:45.393
[SPEAKER_08]: Good pick.

01:31:45.734 --> 01:31:48.735
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew nothing about this game, and now I'm looking at it going, gosh, I want to play this.

01:31:48.856 --> 01:31:50.396
[SPEAKER_08]: Too bad I'll have to emulate it.

01:31:50.597 --> 01:31:54.519
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get... It is out there, too.

01:31:54.879 --> 01:31:55.900
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it is.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.561
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it is.

01:31:57.601 --> 01:32:00.503
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would not blame a single soul for downloading the game.

01:32:00.543 --> 01:32:00.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

01:32:02.004 --> 01:32:15.778
[SPEAKER_08]: in my allegedly you know a game that's this hard to find that's this old I mean who could really fault you for it if it was on virtual console or something we'd say go you better believe I have an emulated copy of Panorama Cotton since they made 600 total in the world so

01:32:16.673 --> 01:32:19.015
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, there it is, your classic Game of the Week segment.

01:32:19.336 --> 01:32:20.076
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a break.

01:32:20.437 --> 01:32:22.819
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back, plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come.

01:32:23.339 --> 01:32:25.201
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox rumors, yippee-yay.

01:32:25.261 --> 01:32:27.303
[SPEAKER_08]: We only have a few more weeks to sit through those.

01:32:28.244 --> 01:32:33.589
[SPEAKER_08]: Also talking about some free-to-play stuff on Wii U. Call of Duty, yes, and plenty more.

01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:36.291
[SPEAKER_08]: Your calls in the Fugle Question of the Week, all about pinball tonight.

01:32:36.431 --> 01:32:36.752
[SPEAKER_08]: Duty.

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:41.276
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

01:32:47.982 --> 01:32:58.470
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Cinco de Mayo, May 5th, 2013, with episode 503 of our show already in progress.

01:32:58.550 --> 01:33:07.697
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, you missed some pretty lively debates in the first half of the show, so we hope you will check that out in the podcast feed.

01:33:08.358 --> 01:33:12.701
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have to give apologies here at the start of this segment to our friends over at Anime Jam Session.

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:16.562
[SPEAKER_08]: They put on a lovely show, which is on Tuesday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network.

01:33:16.702 --> 01:33:18.563
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.

01:33:18.643 --> 01:33:20.103
[SPEAKER_08]: And they rebroadcast Thursday mornings.

01:33:22.744 --> 01:33:28.685
[SPEAKER_08]: They sent us a bumper for the 500th episode that I still haven't played because I was trying to sync it to music a couple weeks ago.

01:33:28.705 --> 01:33:30.706
[SPEAKER_08]: And I literally ran out of time because it wasn't working.

01:33:31.066 --> 01:33:32.326
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just forgot to do it today.

01:33:32.946 --> 01:33:38.108
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've also been procrastinating it because nobody else except Flaco sent us a bumper.

01:33:38.508 --> 01:33:38.688
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

01:33:39.088 --> 01:33:44.131
[SPEAKER_08]: Please take a look at the post in our forums and send us more bumpers and then I'll have reasons to play them all.

01:33:44.592 --> 01:33:53.978
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also want to give a shout out to our pals over there at Anime Jam Session because I got a lovely package in the mail from a mail package from Ranma this week.

01:33:54.898 --> 01:33:55.919
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:34:21.138 --> 01:34:40.369
[SPEAKER_08]: in coming weeks of the show and maybe if there's like a live event coming up like Fanime or something I'll take some of these with me to that and you can win them from me there too so yeah thank you very much to our pals over there I think Brad's first in line now well what did Brad say oh I sent you guys booze what else do you want

01:34:41.249 --> 01:34:43.391
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Brad, you make a good case.

01:34:43.932 --> 01:34:46.534
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I should be sending him some Cards Against Humanity cards for sure.

01:34:48.316 --> 01:34:50.818
[SPEAKER_08]: We trade goods amongst the Voice of Geeks Network shows.

01:34:50.838 --> 01:34:51.719
[SPEAKER_06]: The bartering system.

01:34:51.739 --> 01:34:52.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, bartering system.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:54.722
[SPEAKER_08]: You give me booze, I give you cards.

01:34:55.603 --> 01:35:00.688
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't give Anime Jam Session anything yet, but I will... Ranma has my heart.

01:35:01.369 --> 01:35:02.129
[SPEAKER_08]: They have my heart.

01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.790
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they have.

01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:03.631
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:13.256
[SPEAKER_03]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase FLAG.

01:35:13.937 --> 01:35:16.998
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let us get back into some gaming news.

01:35:17.138 --> 01:35:19.499
[SPEAKER_08]: Rapid fire news for this part B. Loki.

01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:24.622
[SPEAKER_06]: Borderlands has, well, originally it kind of leaked out from a picture, but...

01:35:25.602 --> 01:35:37.371
[SPEAKER_06]: it has now been officially announced Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is going to be the next piece of DLC or I should say the last piece or fourth piece did they make her politically correct yet?

01:35:37.652 --> 01:35:50.882
[SPEAKER_06]: no so it's sort of a play on Dungeons and Dragons it'll be interesting so that's supposed to be coming out June 25th and it will be included in the season pass otherwise it's 10 bucks

01:35:54.182 --> 01:35:57.565
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new game console trailer this week.

01:35:57.885 --> 01:36:03.229
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even really a game console as much as it's more of like an analog video game synthesizer.

01:36:03.609 --> 01:36:05.310
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a thing called Ming Mecca.

01:36:06.231 --> 01:36:08.192
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really strange.

01:36:08.232 --> 01:36:10.334
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it works just like a synthesizer.

01:36:10.394 --> 01:36:17.559
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has a lot of analog, you know, physical cords that you're plugging in the stuff and, you know, dials you're tweaking and that sort of thing.

01:36:18.159 --> 01:36:18.860
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of...

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.943
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes music like a synthesizer and also kind of does an interactive display.

01:36:24.403 --> 01:36:27.025
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you could do games and stuff sort of on it.

01:36:27.345 --> 01:36:29.206
[SPEAKER_06]: Very basic glitchy looking things.

01:36:31.068 --> 01:36:35.150
[SPEAKER_06]: I see this more as like something that you would see with like chiptune artists or something like that.

01:36:35.231 --> 01:36:38.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of messing around with you know in like a live performance type setting.

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:42.715
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it seems like that would you know play well to it.

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.497
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus it is open source.

01:36:45.717 --> 01:36:49.260
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can actually you know build one yourself if you want.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:37:15.777
[SPEAKER_06]: or they're going to be selling it they said they estimate the console is going to be anywhere from you know um you know was it $350 for the control core or $1,000 for the world core because it's a few I mean we're talking like it is a synthesizer so that's kind of in the realm of that makes sense price wise as a video game console not so much but it does get controlled partially within the NES controller so it looks interesting um

01:37:16.837 --> 01:37:41.777
[SPEAKER_06]: and last but not least the kickstarted project or it was attempted to be kickstarted but it kind of failed Project Awakened has now put itself on hold I guess due to alternate funding options and donors are now receiving refunds in other words somebody is picking this thing up and will probably publish it so that's kind of cool

01:37:43.058 --> 01:37:44.239
[SPEAKER_06]: because it looked kind of interesting.

01:37:44.319 --> 01:37:46.201
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the first Unreal 4 games.

01:37:46.622 --> 01:37:52.607
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a third-person superhero action game.

01:37:53.468 --> 01:37:54.109
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could be neat.

01:37:54.966 --> 01:37:57.067
[SPEAKER_08]: DRAGON QUEST 8 White Knight Chronicles Rare Drop Adventure Note

01:38:14.895 --> 01:38:17.496
[SPEAKER_08]: Earth Devastating B-Rank Girlfriend.

01:38:18.356 --> 01:38:19.957
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it's called.

01:38:20.317 --> 01:38:21.278
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an awesome title.

01:38:21.738 --> 01:38:22.898
[SPEAKER_08]: And Wonderflick.

01:38:23.418 --> 01:38:24.959
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of a neat little sounding thing, too.

01:38:25.499 --> 01:38:28.080
[SPEAKER_08]: They were all trademarked by the developer all around the same time.

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:29.201
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows what this could be?

01:38:29.241 --> 01:38:31.262
[SPEAKER_08]: These could be three titles in one series.

01:38:31.322 --> 01:38:33.062
[SPEAKER_08]: These could all be new games in development.

01:38:33.803 --> 01:38:34.903
[SPEAKER_08]: They could be red herrings.

01:38:35.223 --> 01:38:35.543
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

01:38:35.563 --> 01:38:36.264
[SPEAKER_08]: They could be anything.

01:38:37.024 --> 01:38:40.565
[SPEAKER_08]: But I hope they all sound like neat titles.

01:38:40.625 --> 01:38:42.166
[SPEAKER_08]: So whatever they are, they're pretty kick-ass titles.

01:38:42.967 --> 01:39:04.805
[SPEAKER_06]: but of course you know you can't judge a game based off its title but these are good starts but we don't know anything else about these maybe E3 maybe Tokyo Game Show it sounds like it might be like the third guild game they always have like these weird like kind of indie games that are a prize of that so maybe these are titles in that okay that's a good theory

01:39:05.686 --> 01:39:05.946
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:39:06.366 --> 01:39:12.712
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Nintendo apparently going to be introducing Retro Studios' new project in the not-so-distant future.

01:39:13.193 --> 01:39:15.735
[SPEAKER_08]: Could this be E3 or a Nintendo Direct?

01:39:16.175 --> 01:39:16.836
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

01:39:17.477 --> 01:39:21.300
[SPEAKER_08]: But Hiroyamada said, quote, I wonder what kind of game it is.

01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:24.763
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope to introduce it to you in the not-so-distant future.

01:39:24.984 --> 01:39:25.304
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

01:39:26.585 --> 01:39:28.968
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you what it should be It should be a new Excite Shark game

01:39:41.923 --> 01:39:42.964
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be a new Excite Truck game.

01:39:42.984 --> 01:39:45.166
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you want Retro Studios to be working on?

01:39:45.206 --> 01:39:46.327
[SPEAKER_06]: That would sell me a system.

01:39:46.527 --> 01:39:48.228
[SPEAKER_06]: A new Excite Truck game that's good.

01:39:48.508 --> 01:39:53.492
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking fucking Excite Bots trick racing because that was absolute shit.

01:39:54.133 --> 01:39:57.796
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be tickled pink if it's a new Metroid or a new F-Zero.

01:39:58.296 --> 01:39:59.417
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially a new F-Zero.

01:39:59.937 --> 01:40:00.678
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be pretty cool.

01:40:01.478 --> 01:40:02.699
[SPEAKER_08]: At least that's a racing game, Loki.

01:40:02.719 --> 01:40:04.060
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta get excited about that a little bit.

01:40:04.981 --> 01:40:07.343
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:29.531
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it online only?

01:40:29.771 --> 01:40:31.752
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the rumor is, yes it is.

01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:36.234
[SPEAKER_08]: But what, I mean, of course that rumor is going to be out there after what happened with SimCity.

01:40:36.274 --> 01:40:39.856
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be very interesting to see how what happened with SimCity plays into this.

01:40:40.236 --> 01:40:45.439
[SPEAKER_08]: Regardless, we all know it's got to happen eventually, but it looks like it's something that could be happening relatively soon.

01:40:45.819 --> 01:40:48.740
[SPEAKER_08]: They are saying this could actually be announced tomorrow, May 6th.

01:40:48.941 --> 01:40:52.002
[SPEAKER_08]: So by the time any of you hear this podcast, it could have been announced today.

01:40:52.443 --> 01:40:59.472
[SPEAKER_08]: This is due to a web domain registration apparently by EA which I would have thought you would grab the Sims 4 name a hell of a long time ago.

01:40:59.612 --> 01:40:59.953
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

01:41:00.533 --> 01:41:02.957
[SPEAKER_08]: The studio is holding a conference call tomorrow.

01:41:03.237 --> 01:41:04.799
[SPEAKER_08]: Supposed to be making a major announcement.

01:41:04.839 --> 01:41:06.001
[SPEAKER_08]: So what the hell else would it be?

01:41:06.181 --> 01:41:08.544
[SPEAKER_08]: Except maybe five more Sims 3 expansions.

01:41:08.704 --> 01:41:08.985
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:41:10.046 --> 01:41:11.086
[SPEAKER_06]: They have about that many.

01:41:11.786 --> 01:41:13.087
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to know what's really sad?

01:41:13.807 --> 01:41:22.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that with Sims 3, the stuff that the mod community's been doing is worlds better than any of the official stuff that EA put out.

01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:26.490
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even down to custom furniture, everything.

01:41:26.630 --> 01:41:28.811
[SPEAKER_03]: The fan community has just been perfect.

01:41:28.851 --> 01:41:34.753
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love for... It would actually... I would buy it if they would hire some of the mod people.

01:41:34.773 --> 01:41:35.413
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who've done mods.

01:41:35.433 --> 01:41:36.253
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're not Valve.

01:41:36.673 --> 01:41:43.063
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but I'm saying that would sell it for me right there is certain people in the custom community.

01:41:43.083 --> 01:41:44.565
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to be always connected?

01:41:45.066 --> 01:41:46.047
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

01:41:46.448 --> 01:41:47.649
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate people.

01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:49.833
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Sims Online...

01:41:52.256 --> 01:41:53.917
[SPEAKER_08]: Sims Online worked so well.

01:41:54.418 --> 01:41:58.241
[SPEAKER_08]: And also the Sims Social worked so well that they're totally closing that game.

01:41:58.261 --> 01:42:00.863
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Sims Social, everybody was fucking playing that.

01:42:01.243 --> 01:42:02.284
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Sims Social.

01:42:02.304 --> 01:42:03.885
[SPEAKER_08]: That came and went.

01:42:04.025 --> 01:42:07.528
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of wish Candy Crush Saga would... I finally blocked it this week, y'all.

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:08.569
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't anymore.

01:42:08.669 --> 01:42:15.875
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what happens last night, I'm lying in bed and I hear this very familiar song and I'm like, what are you doing over there on your phone, Alan?

01:42:16.417 --> 01:42:19.158
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm stuck on level 29 in Candy Crush Saga.

01:42:19.758 --> 01:42:20.959
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

01:42:21.419 --> 01:42:22.339
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't escape.

01:42:22.999 --> 01:42:25.680
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, I don't hate people, just most people.

01:42:27.841 --> 01:42:29.222
[SPEAKER_08]: You love all our listeners, right?

01:42:29.782 --> 01:42:30.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:42:30.062 --> 01:42:31.143
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good.

01:42:32.343 --> 01:42:33.423
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love you guys.

01:42:35.684 --> 01:42:36.585
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously, I love you guys.

01:42:36.605 --> 01:42:36.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

01:42:37.185 --> 01:42:37.525
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

01:42:37.885 --> 01:42:38.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you mean it.

01:42:38.445 --> 01:42:38.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

01:42:39.426 --> 01:42:40.986
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

01:42:41.546 --> 01:42:42.667
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not Grumpy Cat.

01:42:43.967 --> 01:42:45.068
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not Grumpy Cat.

01:42:45.388 --> 01:42:45.508
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm...

01:42:47.310 --> 01:43:15.334
[SPEAKER_03]: Disgruntled Cat Anyway, Square Enix is remastering soundtracks from Final Fantasy games We will be seeing the Final Fantasy 4 one released on looks like July 3rd this year That's the first one they're starting with and they're going to have box art done especially by Yoshitaka Amano and then of course we're probably not going to see it in the US but

01:43:16.195 --> 01:43:19.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Square Enix does do digital releases for a lot of their albums so we might see it on iTunes

01:43:21.611 --> 01:43:26.292
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, if you actually want a physical CD so that you can get the awesome artwork, there's always CD Japan.

01:43:27.533 --> 01:43:32.914
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Breakman, I am not hating your faces, okay?

01:43:33.034 --> 01:43:34.174
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hate anyone's faces.

01:43:35.735 --> 01:43:49.298
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we have a notice that there is a DVD out called 100 Yen, the Japanese Arcade Experience, which is a documentary about arcade culture in Japan.

01:43:50.419 --> 01:43:53.001
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a trailer for it out if you're interested in looking at it.

01:43:53.161 --> 01:44:00.869
[SPEAKER_03]: But not only does it talk about just gaming, arcade gaming in Japan, it does talk about the US and Canada as well.

01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:02.491
[SPEAKER_03]: And the casual gamers.

01:44:06.065 --> 01:44:21.662
[SPEAKER_03]: and last but not least for people who are pinball fans like me Pinball FX 2 is coming to Steam the game itself will be free but the tables will be 10 bucks a pop 6 pounds for our British listeners

01:44:22.382 --> 01:44:34.433
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's including Star Wars Pinball, Marvel Pinball, Marvel Pinball Adventures of Virtue, Marvel Pinball Avengers Chronicles, Pinball FX2 Core Collection and Zen Classics.

01:44:35.654 --> 01:44:37.115
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a pretty good time playing it.

01:44:37.436 --> 01:44:44.382
[SPEAKER_03]: It sort of gave me some of the feel of Pin Mame but not quite.

01:44:45.923 --> 01:44:47.865
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all original stuff so it was pretty neat.

01:44:48.325 --> 01:44:48.746
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

01:44:48.926 --> 01:44:49.106
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:44:49.986 --> 01:44:59.368
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so let's move on a little bit to some actual, I don't know, Xbox rumors, if you will.

01:45:00.628 --> 01:45:18.391
[SPEAKER_06]: This week, it was made known that Microsoft has registered the domain for Xbox Fusion, and also some other stuff related to XboxFusion.de, XboxFusion.co.uk, XboxFusion.biz...

01:45:19.711 --> 01:45:26.576
[SPEAKER_06]: So, one would think, hey, you know, Xbox Fusion, that could be a name of a console, maybe.

01:45:29.018 --> 01:45:35.382
[SPEAKER_06]: So, good chances are that that might be actually what they're going to finally call the console.

01:45:36.964 --> 01:45:39.766
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little bit better than Xbox Lube, I don't know.

01:45:40.726 --> 01:45:43.088
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless they're having a service called Fusion.

01:45:43.869 --> 01:46:04.712
[SPEAKER_06]: uh that's true I guess they could have that as well um but there at least there is something that's going to be you know kind of um relating to the Xbox it's going to be named Fusion so we'll see if it's actually the console or it's not a bad name for a console I guess it could work it just seems like they arbitrarily picked a name out of their asses Fusion sounds cool let's call it that

01:46:05.997 --> 01:46:30.628
[SPEAKER_06]: and also there is a rumor that the next or the first I guess debut game of Respawn Entertainment is going to actually be this game called Titan and some information is kind of leaked out about it already saying that the game is going to revolve around these giant mechs called Titans and

01:46:31.148 --> 01:46:55.855
[SPEAKER_06]: and so it's kind of a multiplayer shooter game but then it's also got these giant mechs as well kind of think it's like a little bit like mech warrior but maybe more of the scale of it kind of reminds me of like a command and conquer generals and like mech warrior the titan thing is really funny because blizzard has that project titan thing right now now that we all know that's not the real name of the game but it's just funny that like there is a game called titan maybe

01:46:57.486 --> 01:46:59.547
[SPEAKER_06]: and then, um, what else?

01:47:00.207 --> 01:47:04.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and apparently the, you know, this might be exclusive to the next platform.

01:47:04.749 --> 01:47:07.210
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming it's going to be exclusive for a limited amount of time.

01:47:07.230 --> 01:47:10.431
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's going to be exclusive forever, but probably at launch.

01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:13.832
[SPEAKER_08]: And Microsoft's had a few deals like this with the DLC, Windows and all that.

01:47:13.892 --> 01:47:14.672
[SPEAKER_08]: Skyrim, right?

01:47:14.752 --> 01:47:15.072
[SPEAKER_08]: Had that?

01:47:15.993 --> 01:47:16.333
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:47:16.833 --> 01:47:17.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.

01:47:17.653 --> 01:47:18.354
[SPEAKER_06]: Skyrim did.

01:47:18.654 --> 01:47:21.635
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty does and, um, did.

01:47:22.175 --> 01:47:23.635
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto did.

01:47:23.655 --> 01:47:24.316
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

01:47:24.916 --> 01:47:25.016
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

01:47:27.336 --> 01:47:28.817
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a lot.

01:47:29.998 --> 01:47:34.082
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, Illumaroom had a new trailer this week.

01:47:34.642 --> 01:47:48.614
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those who don't remember, Illumaroom is this brand new peripheral that's going to tie in with the new Xbox and perhaps PCs as well to kind of extend the play field for your games.

01:47:49.275 --> 01:47:53.118
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way it's being done, they actually showed the device this time, so we don't have to imagine what it looks like.

01:47:54.119 --> 01:47:56.200
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all very prototype right now.

01:47:56.801 --> 01:48:01.723
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, it's basically a projector attached to a Kinect sensor.

01:48:02.384 --> 01:48:03.945
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Kinect sensor scans the room.

01:48:04.045 --> 01:48:08.847
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it actually will... You can use it for special effects.

01:48:09.027 --> 01:48:13.090
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use it to increase your field of view.

01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:15.031
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also use it for like...

01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:17.840
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:48:35.806 --> 01:48:38.907
[SPEAKER_06]: as early as July is when they're going to publicly demo this.

01:48:39.367 --> 01:48:42.429
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not expected to be something that the system launches with if it does eventually come out.

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:45.870
[SPEAKER_08]: Which might have bummed out some people that were kind of looking forward to something like this.

01:48:45.890 --> 01:48:47.250
[SPEAKER_08]: The concepts look really cool.

01:48:47.930 --> 01:49:01.135
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be worried that if they launched this with a console, which, don't get me wrong, I think if they could get it in the console and have the price of it be cheap enough, because adding a projector, an HD projector, and another Kinect sensor.

01:49:01.275 --> 01:49:03.997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but what if it's not like the images itself?

01:49:04.077 --> 01:49:09.681
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's just like colored lights and things like that that enhance the... But it's actually... I mean, it looks neat.

01:49:09.941 --> 01:49:10.962
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it looked neat.

01:49:11.002 --> 01:49:17.446
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's what they're still trying to figure out is the... The problem is though is they envision it as like a projector that sits on a coffee table.

01:49:17.506 --> 01:49:21.509
[SPEAKER_06]: So once again, you're talking Kinect sensor... I don't got a coffee table.

01:49:21.529 --> 01:49:21.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

01:49:22.009 --> 01:49:23.130
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for rich people.

01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:24.391
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a coffee table.

01:49:24.571 --> 01:49:30.995
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have this... You're limiting it now to, okay, it's going to have this... This thing is going to sit on a coffee table.

01:49:31.255 --> 01:49:32.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hold on a second.

01:49:33.236 --> 01:49:36.358
[SPEAKER_06]: If I have to have a coffee table in my room, this projection is going to say... Where do I play Kinect?

01:49:36.498 --> 01:49:37.119
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:49:37.419 --> 01:49:38.019
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:41.101
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're telling me to move the coffee table out of the way to play the Kinect games.

01:49:41.321 --> 01:49:42.122
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm confused.

01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:44.343
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not rearranging the goddamn furniture to play Xbox.

01:49:44.363 --> 01:49:46.325
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want me to do with this coffee table?

01:49:47.445 --> 01:49:50.387
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft unveils the easily movable coffee table.

01:49:50.467 --> 01:49:51.008
[SPEAKER_06]: It moves out.

01:49:51.088 --> 01:49:51.868
[SPEAKER_06]: It moves back in.

01:49:51.948 --> 01:49:53.669
[SPEAKER_06]: It puts sensors on it.

01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:54.730
[SPEAKER_06]: It puts coffee on it.

01:49:55.170 --> 01:49:55.450
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:57.372
[SPEAKER_08]: The Microsoft Transformer coffee table.

01:49:58.032 --> 01:49:58.853
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming to you from Ikea.

01:49:58.873 --> 01:49:59.173
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:50:01.505 --> 01:50:02.946
[SPEAKER_08]: That would mean you'd have to build it yourself.

01:50:03.307 --> 01:50:06.269
[SPEAKER_08]: And it would have a name like Sfarcigar Devan.

01:50:07.670 --> 01:50:08.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Billy.

01:50:08.871 --> 01:50:09.912
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the bookcase.

01:50:09.952 --> 01:50:10.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

01:50:11.634 --> 01:50:14.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Fusion is the new coffee table.

01:50:14.656 --> 01:50:17.098
[SPEAKER_06]: This system is the coffee table.

01:50:18.159 --> 01:50:19.540
[SPEAKER_06]: It fuses to your coffee table.

01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:20.661
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the coffee table.

01:50:21.041 --> 01:50:22.523
[SPEAKER_08]: It becomes one with the coffee table.

01:50:22.543 --> 01:50:24.745
[SPEAKER_06]: It hopefully has nothing to do with Fusion Frenzy.

01:50:25.886 --> 01:50:28.748
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's pray, please, that it has nothing to do with Fusion Frenzy.

01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:32.184
[SPEAKER_06]: or what if we can see the headlines now.

01:50:32.425 --> 01:50:34.587
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a frenzy for the new Xbox Fusion.

01:50:34.647 --> 01:50:37.731
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Fusion frenzy.

01:50:38.091 --> 01:50:45.139
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakman in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, Xbox needs to move the coffee table its damn self.

01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:47.081
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hilarious.

01:50:47.641 --> 01:50:48.603
[SPEAKER_08]: Setting up room for connect.

01:50:51.765 --> 01:50:53.366
[SPEAKER_08]: It just knocks over your coffee table.

01:50:54.286 --> 01:50:57.548
[SPEAKER_08]: It disappears into the floor with everything that was left on it.

01:50:57.948 --> 01:50:59.569
[SPEAKER_06]: It pushes the cat out of the way.

01:51:02.570 --> 01:51:08.172
[SPEAKER_06]: With Xbox Fusion's new telekinetic abilities, it can move your furniture for you.

01:51:08.832 --> 01:51:10.133
[SPEAKER_06]: Arrange a drone for a connect.

01:51:12.353 --> 01:51:13.074
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be hilarious.

01:51:13.094 --> 01:51:17.556
[SPEAKER_08]: I want one of those giant holes that opens up in the ground to drop people I don't like out of sight forever.

01:51:17.576 --> 01:51:18.717
[SPEAKER_08]: Creating a knee-high wall.

01:51:18.837 --> 01:51:19.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Couch moves in the place.

01:51:21.218 --> 01:51:22.339
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, now we're getting stupid.

01:51:22.979 --> 01:51:24.320
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to the Fugo Question of the Week.

01:51:32.301 --> 01:51:35.922
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook, Google+, slam them together, you get Fugle.

01:51:36.002 --> 01:51:37.462
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Fugle question of the week.

01:51:37.642 --> 01:51:41.963
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week we ask a question of our fan communities and read some of our favorite answers here on the show.

01:51:42.383 --> 01:51:45.484
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, like last week, way too many answers.

01:51:45.564 --> 01:51:46.685
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only read some of them tonight.

01:51:46.725 --> 01:51:47.365
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, guys.

01:51:47.725 --> 01:51:51.786
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start on Google+, with the answer to the question about pinball.

01:51:52.466 --> 01:51:55.907
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura likes to talk about pinball a lot on the show.

01:51:56.427 --> 01:51:57.227
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot, you guys.

01:51:57.467 --> 01:51:58.487
[SPEAKER_08]: She talks about it a lot.

01:51:58.908 --> 01:52:00.188
[SPEAKER_08]: She's talked about it five minutes ago.

01:52:01.084 --> 01:52:01.565
[SPEAKER_08]: Ice P on Google Plus

01:52:23.064 --> 01:52:28.505
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my favorite simulators were Pinball Dreams, Pinball Fantasies, and Slam Tilt on the Amiga.

01:52:30.285 --> 01:52:32.726
[SPEAKER_08]: The very first thing a listener named was my absolute favorite.

01:52:32.766 --> 01:52:34.706
[SPEAKER_08]: Pinball Dreams was on the PC as well.

01:52:34.726 --> 01:52:36.226
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it was more known as an Amiga game.

01:52:36.506 --> 01:52:37.326
[SPEAKER_08]: The game was amazing.

01:52:37.406 --> 01:52:38.747
[SPEAKER_08]: And Pinball Fantasies was great too.

01:52:39.987 --> 01:52:41.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I just had one of those random thoughts.

01:52:41.547 --> 01:52:41.727
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

01:52:42.167 --> 01:52:44.208
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Commodore 64 set that works for arcade.

01:52:44.508 --> 01:52:45.008
[SPEAKER_03]: Just letting you know.

01:52:46.388 --> 01:52:47.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the emulator thingy?

01:52:47.768 --> 01:52:48.388
[SPEAKER_08]: I have that.

01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.569
[SPEAKER_08]: Stoked.

01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:52.049
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, back to Pinball.

01:52:53.088 --> 01:52:55.830
[SPEAKER_08]: How can you of all people change the topic away from pinball?

01:52:56.130 --> 01:52:56.670
[SPEAKER_08]: Shame on you.

01:52:57.071 --> 01:52:59.752
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're talking about Dragon Crush?

01:52:59.812 --> 01:53:00.793
[SPEAKER_08]: Going back to Ice P.

01:53:02.378 --> 01:53:27.286
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the fact that these weren't real tables the way no one could unfavorably compare them to the real thing plus it allowed them the freedom to let their imagination run wild Panaxium says I remember my first pinball game was Moraph's Pinball back on the 386 I was too young to understand how awful of a game that was later I got hooked on Epic Pinball and that was a blast however I don't think I ever had the chance to play a real pinball table really?

01:53:28.598 --> 01:53:29.980
[SPEAKER_08]: You've never played a real pinball table?

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.522
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess maybe that's one of those things I take for granted.

01:53:32.423 --> 01:53:32.843
[SPEAKER_08]: Bars.

01:53:33.103 --> 01:53:37.729
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, maybe you're not like a bar person, but a lot of bars have them, have pinball tables.

01:53:38.009 --> 01:53:38.750
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowling alleys.

01:53:38.970 --> 01:53:40.492
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's a thing where you're at.

01:53:40.612 --> 01:53:41.273
[SPEAKER_08]: Movie theaters.

01:53:41.293 --> 01:53:42.094
[SPEAKER_08]: Movie theaters.

01:53:42.154 --> 01:53:44.677
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to... And John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza.

01:53:44.697 --> 01:53:46.540
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to go find a pinball table, son.

01:53:47.761 --> 01:53:50.364
[SPEAKER_08]: Travis H on Google Plus says, I love pinball.

01:53:50.444 --> 01:53:54.668
[SPEAKER_08]: Used to play the Addams Family table until my quarters ran dry at a rec center here in Florida.

01:53:55.129 --> 01:53:56.810
[SPEAKER_08]: Also love the Indiana Jones table.

01:53:56.890 --> 01:53:58.832
[SPEAKER_08]: I play a lot of Zen pinball on my Vita.

01:53:59.173 --> 01:54:03.017
[SPEAKER_08]: Collecting the tables and going back and forth with friends trying to top scores.

01:54:03.137 --> 01:54:03.838
[SPEAKER_08]: Great game.

01:54:04.589 --> 01:54:05.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Prop Cycle Addams Family?

01:54:06.271 --> 01:54:07.752
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

01:54:07.812 --> 01:54:09.373
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that at California Extreme or something?

01:54:09.573 --> 01:54:09.813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:54:09.833 --> 01:54:11.054
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, we need to figure out when that is this year.

01:54:11.094 --> 01:54:13.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Pinnagogo's coming up in a couple months too, by the way.

01:54:13.076 --> 01:54:13.456
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it really?

01:54:13.536 --> 01:54:13.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:54:14.076 --> 01:54:15.337
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to get these things on the calendar.

01:54:16.238 --> 01:54:18.640
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... Isn't... We're taking our jackpot.

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:21.342
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't California Extreme almost always the last weekend in July?

01:54:21.402 --> 01:54:23.463
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I bet you it's the same frickin' day as Clue.

01:54:23.564 --> 01:54:24.144
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you anything.

01:54:24.979 --> 01:54:37.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that might be, but I know that for, well, Pentagogo is the one in Dixon and we're taking Jackbot there because the creator of Jackbot and a bunch of the series is going to be at Pentagogo this year.

01:54:38.106 --> 01:54:40.428
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's July 13th to 14th this year.

01:54:40.648 --> 01:54:44.690
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be in rehearsals that weekend, but maybe I can go on Sunday at least.

01:54:44.850 --> 01:54:45.871
[SPEAKER_08]: We should still make it happen.

01:54:46.031 --> 01:54:46.651
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I should.

01:54:46.671 --> 01:54:47.412
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun.

01:54:47.772 --> 01:54:48.233
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow.

01:54:49.414 --> 01:54:50.374
[SPEAKER_08]: Where were we?

01:54:50.454 --> 01:54:51.055
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to Facebook.

01:54:51.095 --> 01:54:52.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are some of the answers from Google+.

01:54:52.756 --> 01:54:54.878
[SPEAKER_08]: Please check out our community on Google to read them all.

01:54:55.258 --> 01:54:58.100
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to read some of the answers here on Facebook as well.

01:54:58.861 --> 01:55:02.524
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy R. says, I still don't quite get pinball.

01:55:03.004 --> 01:55:03.485
[SPEAKER_08]: Any tips for Andy?

01:55:25.448 --> 01:55:27.889
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a series of DVDs out.

01:55:28.309 --> 01:55:31.671
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a few of them, but a lot of them have been put on YouTube.

01:55:32.431 --> 01:55:35.893
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually teaches you a little bit of the physics involved with a well-balanced pinball table.

01:55:36.813 --> 01:55:46.318
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is learning how to catch the ball with your flippers and learning where your triggers are because pretty much it's really just a game of physics.

01:55:47.017 --> 01:55:52.240
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ever... Here's the most common mistake new players make, is that they hit both flippers at the same time.

01:55:52.561 --> 01:55:53.882
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ever do that.

01:55:53.922 --> 01:55:58.905
[SPEAKER_08]: The only time that might work is multiball, when it just so happens to be timed that way.

01:55:59.245 --> 01:56:04.148
[SPEAKER_08]: But you gotta get yourself out of the habit of hitting both flippers at the same time, and if you can do that, that's the first step.

01:56:04.388 --> 01:56:07.591
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you were just trying to keep from draining, keep your eye on the flippers.

01:56:09.344 --> 01:56:12.885
[SPEAKER_03]: When you see that ball come into your field of vision, hit whatever flipper it's going towards.

01:56:12.905 --> 01:56:13.985
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I want to play some pinball.

01:56:14.666 --> 01:56:15.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to my house.

01:56:15.246 --> 01:56:15.746
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn this question.

01:56:15.786 --> 01:56:16.026
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:56:16.206 --> 01:56:17.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to my house.

01:56:17.526 --> 01:56:20.087
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeremy J., my buddy from Koopa Club.

01:56:20.107 --> 01:56:21.708
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give a shout out to that podcast.

01:56:21.728 --> 01:56:22.848
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a fun little bunch.

01:56:22.968 --> 01:56:25.409
[SPEAKER_08]: They just had a Drunky episode not that long ago either.

01:56:25.469 --> 01:56:26.049
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are fun.

01:56:26.289 --> 01:56:51.018
[SPEAKER_08]: so looking forward to meeting him in August when they come out here for GamerX but anyway Jeremy J says I'm dreadful at pinball in every form whether it's on an actual table or a digital version that doesn't stop me from really enjoying it though I sunk 10 plus hours into Zen Pinball 2 and didn't even realize it in terms of tables I wouldn't pass up anything horror related would have to get at least one go from me Twilight Zone, Creature from the Black Lagoon etc.

01:56:51.118 --> 01:56:53.679
[SPEAKER_08]: Creature is awesome you used to have that one we did yeah

01:56:54.722 --> 01:56:55.623
[SPEAKER_08]: Gaming Nerd says,

01:57:10.191 --> 01:57:19.798
[SPEAKER_08]: Video game pinball is emulated realism and can still run the risk of a bug in the physics engine used to simulate the ball's movement and hit detection against the bumpers, flippers, etc.

01:57:20.238 --> 01:57:25.241
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, who doesn't love a machine full of flashing lights and that deafening loud knocker when you earn a free game?

01:57:25.882 --> 01:57:30.025
[SPEAKER_08]: Not going to disagree with you, gaming nerd, but the real machines can be full of bugs too.

01:57:30.965 --> 01:57:31.265
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

01:57:58.863 --> 01:58:16.751
[SPEAKER_03]: well we had a mention of Twilight Zone earlier with Twilight Zone they also use ceramic balls for Powerball shut up you guys should see the look on Rob's face it's maybe a little troll face do you shine the balls yourself?

01:58:17.861 --> 01:58:18.341
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:58:18.862 --> 01:58:19.202
[SPEAKER_08]: Bite me.

01:58:20.002 --> 01:58:26.706
[SPEAKER_03]: But another thing too, tables are actually waxed, especially if they're wood surface tables.

01:58:27.566 --> 01:58:28.787
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot that has to be done.

01:58:28.887 --> 01:58:32.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the type of leg that you use, because we have those nice brass ones on the World Cup.

01:58:33.450 --> 01:58:34.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes even the leg you use on it.

01:58:34.871 --> 01:58:36.912
[SPEAKER_03]: But so much goes into the balance of the game.

01:58:36.932 --> 01:58:39.433
[SPEAKER_03]: You have so many different components to make sure work.

01:58:40.514 --> 01:58:46.137
[SPEAKER_03]: Upkeep of a physical table is going to make or break you playing the game.

01:58:46.570 --> 01:58:55.899
[SPEAKER_06]: So would you say that after extended play on a wax table that the balls would eventually become wax as well?

01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:58.542
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakman in chat says, my balls need a good shining.

01:58:58.702 --> 01:59:00.104
[SPEAKER_03]: You can shine your own damn balls.

01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:06.133
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe after the show he should just go do that.

01:59:06.613 --> 01:59:07.454
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to know about it.

01:59:08.295 --> 01:59:09.016
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just pinball.

01:59:09.637 --> 01:59:09.937
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:59:11.078 --> 01:59:13.481
[SPEAKER_08]: VXJasonXV in chat asks a real question here.

01:59:14.102 --> 01:59:16.344
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the reason for the free game knocker?

01:59:16.525 --> 01:59:17.245
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question.

01:59:17.286 --> 01:59:19.368
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that fucking thing so loud when you win a free game?

01:59:19.588 --> 01:59:21.811
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that just to draw attention in the arcade?

01:59:22.291 --> 01:59:22.752
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, tradition?

01:59:23.392 --> 01:59:23.673
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:59:23.693 --> 01:59:32.999
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe, actually, my thought of it being so loud is that, this is my own theory, is that it's so loud in an arcade that they want to draw attention to that you won one.

01:59:33.059 --> 01:59:34.220
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I figured, yeah.

01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:41.625
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we were, I was playing Jackbot last, actually, Deanna, who was one of our DDR friends.

01:59:41.665 --> 01:59:42.446
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Deanna.

01:59:42.526 --> 01:59:43.467
[SPEAKER_08]: Does she listen to the show?

01:59:43.567 --> 01:59:44.787
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not, but hi anyway.

01:59:44.948 --> 01:59:46.409
[SPEAKER_03]: She's at a baseball game tonight in Fresno.

01:59:46.549 --> 01:59:46.849
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:48.030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you're going to Fresno?

01:59:48.050 --> 01:59:48.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:59:48.749 --> 01:59:49.209
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:00:04.955 --> 02:00:10.718
[SPEAKER_03]: and I swear I tilted the machine or I almost tilted the machine just because I wasn't expecting it.

02:00:10.738 --> 02:00:12.019
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so loud.

02:00:12.079 --> 02:00:17.002
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that new pinball players should know about too is that tilting the machine is okay.

02:00:17.982 --> 02:00:19.243
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about finding the right balance.

02:00:19.303 --> 02:00:24.606
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't slam the thing too much but a little smack, you just gotta slap it on the ass a little bit.

02:00:25.566 --> 02:00:28.048
[SPEAKER_08]: to get those balls right where you gotta get them.

02:00:28.108 --> 02:00:31.170
[SPEAKER_03]: The sweet spot for most tables is gonna be right past the flipper.

02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:33.091
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about that sweet spot.

02:00:33.351 --> 02:00:33.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

02:00:34.271 --> 02:00:37.133
[SPEAKER_03]: And you use the bottom of your palm.

02:00:37.493 --> 02:00:37.774
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

02:00:37.914 --> 02:00:38.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

02:00:40.375 --> 02:00:41.036
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's left.

02:00:44.998 --> 02:00:45.879
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't help it.

02:00:46.119 --> 02:00:47.960
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about the sweet spot.

02:00:50.829 --> 02:00:51.649
[SPEAKER_08]: How about the listeners?

02:00:51.709 --> 02:00:53.830
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the listeners on Facebook.

02:00:54.611 --> 02:00:58.612
[SPEAKER_08]: Burr says, My favorite pinball game of all time is Pinball Construction Set.

02:00:58.972 --> 02:01:01.973
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved making my own pinball tables on my Apple II.

02:01:02.274 --> 02:01:04.094
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the hell is the Kickstarter for a remake?

02:01:04.715 --> 02:01:08.716
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear ya, except replace Apple II with Commodore 64, and that was me.

02:01:08.976 --> 02:01:09.576
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was awesome.

02:01:09.596 --> 02:01:14.318
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a Sega game, too, where you can make a Genesis game that you could make pinball tables.

02:01:14.338 --> 02:01:15.299
[SPEAKER_08]: They did, didn't they?

02:01:15.459 --> 02:01:18.400
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what it was called, but I remember at the back of the box they had one that was like

02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:22.762
[SPEAKER_06]: One bumper and all the flippers you could possibly fit on the screen.

02:01:23.282 --> 02:01:23.922
[SPEAKER_06]: All flippers.

02:01:23.962 --> 02:01:24.723
[SPEAKER_06]: That is all it was.

02:01:25.263 --> 02:01:30.565
[SPEAKER_08]: Fabrice A says, Sadly, pinball machines have become even more rare than arcade cabinets.

02:01:30.965 --> 02:01:32.246
[SPEAKER_08]: I do enjoy pinball a lot.

02:01:32.706 --> 02:01:34.927
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you know how to score big, it's super addictive.

02:01:35.047 --> 02:01:36.788
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played my fair share of pinball tables.

02:01:36.848 --> 02:01:41.430
[SPEAKER_08]: Independence Day, High Roller, The Simpsons, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Lord of the Rings, and the list goes on.

02:01:41.490 --> 02:01:43.591
[SPEAKER_08]: The one I enjoyed the most was The Addams Family.

02:01:44.031 --> 02:01:44.912
[SPEAKER_08]: Very intricate.

02:01:45.832 --> 02:01:48.614
[SPEAKER_06]: Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Game of Thrones

02:02:08.267 --> 02:02:33.873
[SPEAKER_08]: um Shattered Hawk says the girlfriend and I go to the Nickel Cade about once or twice a month we spend most of the time playing the Star Trek and Addams Family pinball games and lastly Edgar R says I love pinball I never passed up the Simpsons at my old local pub again those are just some of the answers from Facebook and Google Plus sorry I didn't have time to read them all and I tonight I kind of pick people that don't usually get in chat and I don't usually hear from on the show in other ways trying to spread the love around a little bit so uh

02:02:34.253 --> 02:02:41.183
[SPEAKER_08]: I do encourage all our listeners though to read the complete list of answers at facebook.com Metallica Pinball is the last one facebook.com they have a Metallica Pinball?

02:02:41.503 --> 02:02:48.773
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah they're gonna fuck that up I think they also did a Kiss Pinball as well hold on that's cool alright

02:02:50.098 --> 02:02:52.019
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into some other news.

02:02:52.079 --> 02:02:53.539
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess it's my turn for other news, too.

02:02:53.639 --> 02:02:57.681
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo possibly going into more free-to-play software.

02:02:57.701 --> 02:03:08.064
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say we heard this rumor before, but this is about something that happened with Satoru Iwata, and I think it was in an interview that was actually on Nintendo.co.jp.

02:03:09.004 --> 02:03:12.645
[SPEAKER_08]: The company is looking beyond digital distribution and is thinking about free-to-play games.

02:03:13.206 --> 02:03:13.626
[SPEAKER_08]: Question.

02:03:14.466 --> 02:03:14.906
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the answer.

02:03:42.515 --> 02:03:48.619
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, as you pointed out, we think the digital distribution of package software is only the first step in expanding our digital business.

02:03:49.039 --> 02:03:52.881
[SPEAKER_08]: We will not simply change our existing package software distribution channel.

02:03:53.302 --> 02:03:57.964
[SPEAKER_08]: Rather, we might have many other types of business models in addition to package software.

02:03:58.325 --> 02:04:05.989
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, we might see more games that are similar to free-to-play games, games that cost much less, or games that require a monthly subscription fee.

02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:08.331
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be Uncharted territory for Nintendo.

02:04:09.071 --> 02:04:23.465
[SPEAKER_08]: Digitalization allows for greater flexibility whereby having more ways to make payments both software developers and consumers have more options and Nintendo 3DS and Wii U have flexible systems to handle such treads so it is now a question of putting these ideas into action.

02:04:23.925 --> 02:04:31.693
[SPEAKER_08]: I can definitely say that Nintendo will make new offers that go well beyond simply replacing packaged software with digital software.

02:04:32.293 --> 02:04:48.973
[SPEAKER_08]: hmm hmm now that doesn't necessarily mean free to play but certainly they are looking at mixing things up a little bit and not just being digital versions of the same same stuff I think Jamie's next story ties into this a little bit as well so I'll let her go next and we'll come back to this okay well

02:04:49.622 --> 02:04:51.303
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:05:07.313 --> 02:05:08.233
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:05:22.899 --> 02:05:29.507
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no idea that this was... I guess I tweeted about it because I'm like, whoa, the Wii U thing lets you go inside places now.

02:05:29.547 --> 02:05:33.091
[SPEAKER_08]: And somebody responded and said, actually, Google added that a while ago.

02:05:33.151 --> 02:05:34.012
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I missed that.

02:05:34.032 --> 02:05:35.253
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's crazy.

02:05:35.294 --> 02:05:36.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I have to ask.

02:05:36.054 --> 02:05:38.057
[SPEAKER_06]: The software I know is free right now.

02:05:38.277 --> 02:05:38.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:05:39.838 --> 02:05:41.239
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not going to be free forever.

02:05:41.959 --> 02:05:44.141
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this something that someone would actually pay for?

02:05:44.161 --> 02:05:45.841
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because it seems kind of dumb.

02:05:46.041 --> 02:05:47.602
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because it's a little choppy.

02:05:47.742 --> 02:05:48.683
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's neat.

02:05:48.743 --> 02:05:50.764
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a really neat concept.

02:05:51.544 --> 02:05:56.127
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's probably like internet browser where it's going to be free for forever and then they'll charge for it at some point.

02:05:56.187 --> 02:05:57.227
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.

02:05:57.787 --> 02:06:00.809
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they have this other thing that they're charging for that are videos.

02:06:00.889 --> 02:06:08.793
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you can download a video of a double-decker tour thing going through parts of London and you can do the whole pan around with the thing.

02:06:09.193 --> 02:06:14.118
[SPEAKER_08]: But they want to charge you like $1.50 for a couple minute, essentially like a two minute video.

02:06:14.139 --> 02:06:14.839
[SPEAKER_08]: That's silly.

02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:18.944
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a demo that has a little bit of all of them and that's well enough.

02:06:19.224 --> 02:06:19.985
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry, Jamie.

02:06:22.090 --> 02:06:40.542
[SPEAKER_03]: for people who own a Wii U there is a freebie out there Tank Tank Tank is free on the Wii U eShop and then there's paid DLC and then there's also Kung Fu Rabbit so there also are virtual console updates with other games including and these aren't free by the way

02:06:41.022 --> 02:06:43.866
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man and Mega Man are five bucks a pop.

02:06:44.808 --> 02:06:48.653
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were also, let's see, there's some sales.

02:06:48.693 --> 02:06:51.057
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Nano Assault Neo, Zen Pinball 2.

02:06:51.898 --> 02:06:54.762
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the 3DS, there will be Bear Shark.

02:06:55.223 --> 02:06:55.764
[SPEAKER_03]: Bear Shark.

02:06:56.904 --> 02:07:24.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Gummy Bear's Magical Medallion My Writing Stable's 3D Armageddon Operation Dragon Balloon Fight On sale will be Marvel Pinball 3D 3D Classics Kirby's Adventure Dylan's Rolling Western Pushmo Fluidity Spin Cycle Tokyo Crash Mobs Nano Assault EX Art of Balance Touch Fun Fun Mini Golf Touch Cool

02:07:25.686 --> 02:07:25.986
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:07:26.426 --> 02:07:27.287
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I just want to say real quick.

02:07:27.367 --> 02:07:28.747
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually played the Tank Tank Tank.

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:34.150
[SPEAKER_08]: I downloaded it because now Nintendo has that cutting edge technology where it finally downloads things in the background.

02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:36.431
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just set it up to download the one gig thing, whatever.

02:07:36.951 --> 02:07:40.133
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really crippled because you can't even do story mode in it.

02:07:40.313 --> 02:07:43.514
[SPEAKER_08]: All you can do is you can do like the versus mode or whatever, like three times a day.

02:07:43.935 --> 02:07:44.995
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of silly.

02:07:45.475 --> 02:07:47.516
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, there's not a lot to it.

02:07:47.576 --> 02:07:51.158
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, I was, you can't do it online or anything.

02:07:51.238 --> 02:07:55.120
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what's the point of Tank Tank Tank with the silly pictures if you can't play it online?

02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:55.380
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a

02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:55.840
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

02:08:19.236 --> 02:08:20.478
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, let me put it this way.

02:08:22.681 --> 02:08:29.831
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the whole time limit demo thing for multiple plays is stupid.

02:08:30.512 --> 02:08:33.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Saints Row, when that first came out as a demo, was a 30 minute demo.

02:08:33.697 --> 02:08:34.778
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the crap out of it.

02:08:34.798 --> 02:08:36.080
[SPEAKER_06]: I played it over and over and over again.

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:37.681
[SPEAKER_06]: It got me really hyped up about the game.

02:08:37.861 --> 02:08:44.927
[SPEAKER_06]: If I was only limited to play that three times a day, say, oh, hey, I want to show my friend this game that's really awesome that I'm super hyped up about.

02:08:45.047 --> 02:08:48.690
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck, I can't play it until tomorrow because they're being fucktards about it.

02:08:48.710 --> 02:08:50.271
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's stupid.

02:08:50.591 --> 02:08:52.433
[SPEAKER_08]: YY Orange Hat says, got news for you.

02:08:52.493 --> 02:08:54.995
[SPEAKER_08]: Tank Tank Tank's retail version doesn't have online play either.

02:08:55.355 --> 02:08:59.258
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I feared that, and how derpy dumb is that?

02:08:59.438 --> 02:09:03.382
[SPEAKER_08]: That should have been an obvious thing to put in the game, but no.

02:09:03.902 --> 02:09:10.064
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems to me like that's a game though that, and I was excited about it for a while, but it just seems like it would lose something being outside of the arcade too.

02:09:10.584 --> 02:09:14.065
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, especially when you're sitting in the house playing it by yourself, which is not the same, you know?

02:09:14.286 --> 02:09:15.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no one wants to play by themselves, Rob.

02:09:16.106 --> 02:09:19.267
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, apparently Breakman does, if you remember earlier.

02:09:19.587 --> 02:09:21.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing with yourself really should only be like, never mind.

02:09:23.148 --> 02:09:26.370
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked playing it in the arcade because I could just reach over and smack Dan in the head.

02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:28.190
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes.

02:09:28.570 --> 02:09:31.571
[SPEAKER_08]: I like taking the pictures with the little wigs and things.

02:09:31.771 --> 02:09:33.492
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan said I look like Nicki Minaj in one of them.

02:09:34.153 --> 02:09:34.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

02:09:35.675 --> 02:09:40.801
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, one of my old live journal icons is the little tank with the squid in it going, thank you.

02:09:42.423 --> 02:09:42.643
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

02:09:43.324 --> 02:09:43.585
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:09:43.905 --> 02:09:44.666
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on, Loki.

02:09:45.567 --> 02:09:45.947
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:09:47.009 --> 02:09:48.010
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's see.

02:09:48.090 --> 02:09:48.230
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's...

02:09:49.574 --> 02:09:50.094
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty Ghosts

02:10:16.234 --> 02:10:21.680
[SPEAKER_06]: No Wii U version was announced, and I can also confirm that there is no Wii U version as of right now.

02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:27.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it's something that they're saving for some Wii U thing that they're going to say, Oh, by the way, it's Wii U now, too.

02:10:27.525 --> 02:10:31.069
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just don't know if they made their money back on the Wii U version.

02:10:31.089 --> 02:10:33.792
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what a lot of these companies are coming to decide.

02:10:33.892 --> 02:10:36.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, hey, we're not really making a lot of money on it.

02:10:36.154 --> 02:10:36.334
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

02:10:37.655 --> 02:10:54.646
[SPEAKER_06]: uh apparently it's going to revolve around you know uh Ghost from Modern Warfare 2 and um they did say that the new on the next gen game or version of the game is going to have a brand new engine current gen version sorry it's going to be running on the same engine that Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3 I think are running on so

02:10:56.418 --> 02:10:56.878
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:11:14.457 --> 02:11:31.709
[SPEAKER_06]: you know the single player campaign might be cool because now I'm going back and playing through all the single player campaigns from them but as long as the multiplayer is fun that's I don't know I really wish they would just put a multiplayer version of that only make it like maybe half the price or something but then of course they'd be cutting out profits profits profits profits

02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:34.340
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow.

02:11:35.941 --> 02:11:37.061
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited, you guys.

02:11:37.101 --> 02:11:40.362
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been forever since we've been able to do a segment like this.

02:11:40.982 --> 02:11:44.563
[SPEAKER_08]: The way this segment ties to games is really loose, but you know what?

02:11:44.764 --> 02:11:48.825
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to bring in an opportunity to make fun of local news!

02:11:52.296 --> 02:11:53.378
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:12:09.517 --> 02:12:11.498
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to win an Xbox Kinect.

02:12:11.778 --> 02:12:15.959
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only way this ties to video games is that the ultimate prize was an Xbox Kinect.

02:12:15.979 --> 02:12:20.140
[SPEAKER_08]: But you guys, this story is freaking priceless.

02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:21.020
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too dumb to be real.

02:12:21.121 --> 02:12:22.161
[SPEAKER_08]: It's priceless.

02:12:22.521 --> 02:12:23.841
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me think of The Onion.

02:12:24.061 --> 02:12:28.243
[SPEAKER_08]: Courtesy of ABC40 coming out of, where are they based?

02:12:28.283 --> 02:12:28.903
[SPEAKER_08]: Springfield.

02:12:29.623 --> 02:12:30.623
[SPEAKER_08]: and Fox 6.

02:12:30.743 --> 02:12:32.264
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they're owned by the same people.

02:12:32.344 --> 02:12:32.884
[SPEAKER_08]: So here you go.

02:12:32.944 --> 02:12:33.764
[SPEAKER_08]: Courtesy of these guys.

02:12:34.324 --> 02:12:35.465
[SPEAKER_08]: A clip from the local news.

02:12:35.505 --> 02:12:37.585
[SPEAKER_08]: I've searched years for the perfect mattress.

02:12:37.845 --> 02:12:39.886
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care about the perfect mattress.

02:12:39.926 --> 02:12:41.086
[SPEAKER_08]: Mattress hunter.

02:12:41.206 --> 02:12:43.307
[SPEAKER_08]: He searched for the perfect mattress.

02:12:43.387 --> 02:12:44.948
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say local commercials.

02:12:45.028 --> 02:12:46.128
[SPEAKER_08]: I said local news.

02:12:46.188 --> 02:12:48.028
[SPEAKER_03]: Badly animated flash animation.

02:12:48.309 --> 02:12:48.589
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.849
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

02:12:51.758 --> 02:13:01.330
[SPEAKER_01]: Henry Gribholm says he lost his life savings, $2,600, on a carnival game and all he has to show for it is this stuffed banana with dreadlocks.

02:13:07.165 --> 02:13:11.909
[SPEAKER_08]: Gribbom says he attended a Manchester carnival run by Fiesta Shows and wanted to win an Xbox Kinect at a game called Tubs of Fun.

02:13:37.927 --> 02:13:39.990
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right next to the pinball.

02:13:40.110 --> 02:13:42.833
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm willing to bet it's probably not actually Kinect.

02:13:42.913 --> 02:13:47.078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing it's probably an Xbox console with Kinect, I'm thinking.

02:13:47.138 --> 02:13:48.700
[SPEAKER_08]: Because how else could you justify $2,600?

02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:50.782
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking that it's a little misrepresented.

02:13:50.802 --> 02:13:51.102
[SPEAKER_08]: Tubs of fun!

02:13:56.849 --> 02:14:01.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry guys, this is at max volume, so I apologize, this is a little low.

02:14:01.271 --> 02:14:01.491
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

02:14:14.079 --> 02:14:15.641
[SPEAKER_08]: The balls kept popping out.

02:14:15.921 --> 02:14:20.786
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of those games, it's clearly that game where you throw the baseball into the little, it's like the angled bucket, right?

02:14:20.967 --> 02:14:21.908
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of skee-ball-ish.

02:14:22.168 --> 02:14:25.652
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I'm sure they switched the ball on you at the last minute or whatever.

02:14:25.672 --> 02:14:28.475
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not possible that it wasn't rigged.

02:14:30.326 --> 02:14:42.274
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they have this guy walking down the street, pushing his baby in the stroller with this giant banana with dreadlocks?

02:14:42.354 --> 02:14:43.675
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what cracks me up.

02:14:44.015 --> 02:14:47.518
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know why they're giving this fuckwad any attention at all.

02:14:48.278 --> 02:14:49.559
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's so ridiculous.

02:14:49.859 --> 02:14:50.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because it's funny.

02:14:51.995 --> 02:14:53.476
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not funny, it's sad.

02:14:53.977 --> 02:14:55.918
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like those gambling people, you know?

02:14:56.339 --> 02:15:00.343
[SPEAKER_00]: ...at $2,300 more, and soon lost all that as well.

02:15:00.863 --> 02:15:01.964
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a difficult game.

02:15:02.505 --> 02:15:03.626
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've tried it myself.

02:15:03.686 --> 02:15:05.528
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it once, missed probably 20 times.

02:15:05.768 --> 02:15:11.073
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiesta Show says the game is run by an independent contractor who's worked for Fiesta for years.

02:15:11.494 --> 02:15:13.956
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interviewing the contractor to see what happens.

02:15:14.349 --> 02:15:16.750
[SPEAKER_08]: Queen Simia in our chatroom brings up a good point.

02:15:16.810 --> 02:15:18.951
[SPEAKER_08]: On the plus side, that's a really big banana.

02:15:19.691 --> 02:15:20.971
[SPEAKER_08]: Literally, that's what she said.

02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:38.924
[SPEAKER_06]: because he's taking a vacation because he's just made $2,300.

02:15:39.044 --> 02:15:41.107
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, fuck that.

02:15:41.147 --> 02:15:42.209
[SPEAKER_08]: I can skip this next one.

02:15:42.249 --> 02:15:43.170
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the seriousness of that.

02:15:43.230 --> 02:15:46.795
[SPEAKER_08]: You will not see tubs of fun or any fun whatsoever.

02:15:47.256 --> 02:15:49.760
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's... Is this the Daily Show right now?

02:15:52.016 --> 02:15:54.297
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I thought this was onion-worthy.

02:15:55.277 --> 02:16:04.541
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I had $2,600 as my savings, and I wanted an Xbox... But Jamie, he was just addicted.

02:16:04.601 --> 02:16:06.061
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to keep doubling down.

02:16:06.121 --> 02:16:07.722
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to win that money back.

02:16:07.762 --> 02:16:10.043
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's a fucking idiot.

02:16:10.203 --> 02:16:10.623
[SPEAKER_08]: Allegedly.

02:16:10.683 --> 02:16:11.643
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm saying it.

02:16:12.064 --> 02:16:12.944
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going on record.

02:16:13.324 --> 02:16:18.566
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, sir, Mr. Banana, you are tubs of stupid.

02:16:18.926 --> 02:16:38.060
[SPEAKER_06]: and now he has this giant banana he's gotta feed to as well as his children I mean a banana of that size is gonna eat a lot of food Donkey Kong is coming for you that's a lot of potassium and maybe listen to a lot of reggae and smoke some stuff independent contractor that runs the game is not allowed to set up

02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:40.843
[SPEAKER_01]: while an investigation is taking place.

02:16:41.263 --> 02:16:43.365
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you get caught up in the whole double or nothing.

02:16:43.545 --> 02:16:46.348
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to win my money back.

02:16:46.428 --> 02:16:47.949
[SPEAKER_08]: Notice something about this shot.

02:16:47.989 --> 02:16:50.332
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, I want to point this out to you while this guy is being interviewed.

02:16:50.892 --> 02:16:57.138
[SPEAKER_08]: The baby is left alone in the stroller with only the banana to comfort him and he's struggling to get out.

02:16:58.359 --> 02:16:59.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see what Bobby just linked in chat?

02:17:00.041 --> 02:17:00.281
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

02:17:00.341 --> 02:17:00.741
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what?

02:17:02.543 --> 02:17:09.049
[SPEAKER_03]: College Humor wants to pay $2,600 for a giant dreadlock stuffed banana.

02:17:09.109 --> 02:17:09.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course!

02:17:09.869 --> 02:17:10.490
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course!

02:17:10.510 --> 02:17:13.132
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy will end up making a profit off this story.

02:17:13.152 --> 02:17:14.233
[SPEAKER_08]: He will sell it on eBay.

02:17:14.353 --> 02:17:15.274
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

02:17:15.514 --> 02:17:18.397
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we are in debt because of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:17:18.417 --> 02:17:19.037
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just an idiot.

02:17:19.077 --> 02:17:19.698
[SPEAKER_06]: He's an idiot.

02:17:19.818 --> 02:17:21.900
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you try... I mean, come on.

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:24.902
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that you may have gotten caught up in the moment, but...

02:17:26.123 --> 02:17:26.463
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

02:17:45.129 --> 02:17:45.549
Yes, you can.

02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.790
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really, bitch?

02:17:47.170 --> 02:17:47.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.

02:17:48.271 --> 02:17:54.956
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can get things that are equally as ridiculous, like Circus Circus and Excalibur have all those little games in the basement.

02:17:55.256 --> 02:17:56.817
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to know who... Hold on, hold on.

02:17:56.917 --> 02:17:59.799
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragenator in chat says, will he get a hammock for that banana?

02:17:59.899 --> 02:18:00.680
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question.

02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:02.361
[SPEAKER_08]: It's big enough.

02:18:02.781 --> 02:18:07.684
[SPEAKER_08]: Blackwolf wants to know, or Blackwolf suggests, we need a giant orange with dreadlocks.

02:18:07.885 --> 02:18:08.465
[SPEAKER_08]: Instant money.

02:18:08.485 --> 02:18:09.065
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Bobby?

02:18:09.145 --> 02:18:10.646
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make that for 15 bucks.

02:18:11.107 --> 02:18:11.507
Okay.

02:18:11.787 --> 02:18:12.468
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it too.

02:18:12.768 --> 02:18:15.169
[SPEAKER_06]: Who designs these stuff things?

02:18:15.729 --> 02:18:17.530
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, what is it, like a dartboard?

02:18:17.550 --> 02:18:18.251
[SPEAKER_06]: Really bored people.

02:18:18.271 --> 02:18:22.133
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a dartboard that says, you know, fruit and an accessory.

02:18:22.693 --> 02:18:27.676
[SPEAKER_06]: Banana, dreadlocks, orange, cowboy hat.

02:18:27.696 --> 02:18:28.797
[SPEAKER_03]: They should freaking hire me.

02:18:28.897 --> 02:18:30.898
[SPEAKER_03]: I could design some really disturbing stuff.

02:18:30.938 --> 02:18:31.538
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chinese.

02:18:32.539 --> 02:18:34.260
[SPEAKER_01]: He went back the next day to complain.

02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:36.441
[SPEAKER_01]: and the man running the game gave him back $600.

02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:39.983
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's the crazy... The guy gave him back $600?

02:18:40.183 --> 02:18:42.465
[SPEAKER_08]: What carny gives you money back?

02:18:43.766 --> 02:18:45.347
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel sorry for you here.

02:18:45.387 --> 02:18:47.088
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's where the story gets shady.

02:18:47.168 --> 02:18:48.689
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did the carny give him money back?

02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:52.371
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably because he's like, I bet my life savings and the guy felt a little bit bad.

02:18:52.391 --> 02:18:55.373
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how much... The guy is just making cash.

02:18:55.413 --> 02:18:56.533
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he's not losing any.

02:18:56.593 --> 02:18:57.994
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing to really run this game.

02:18:58.014 --> 02:18:58.975
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's wrap this up.

02:18:59.055 --> 02:19:01.596
[SPEAKER_01]: Henry split with the banana and the cash.

02:19:01.857 --> 02:19:03.778
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, thank you for working that pun in.

02:19:04.598 --> 02:19:05.339
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank you.

02:19:05.359 --> 02:19:08.181
[SPEAKER_06]: I was worried that there might not be a pun.

02:19:08.282 --> 02:19:09.643
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you, local news.

02:19:09.723 --> 02:19:11.444
[SPEAKER_08]: He split with a banana.

02:19:11.825 --> 02:19:14.207
[SPEAKER_05]: And filed a report with Manchester PD.

02:19:14.627 --> 02:19:16.709
[SPEAKER_05]: For once in my life, I happen to become that sucker.

02:19:17.730 --> 02:19:18.751
[SPEAKER_03]: At least he admits it.

02:19:25.134 --> 02:19:25.875
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

02:19:43.221 --> 02:19:50.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear College Humor, give me $2,600 and I will draw you a banana with dreadlocks.

02:19:50.586 --> 02:19:51.907
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go find you that banana.

02:19:51.927 --> 02:19:54.809
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we can purchase it on the internet.

02:19:54.849 --> 02:19:59.973
[SPEAKER_08]: With $2,600, I'll buy a plane ticket to Hong Kong and go find the manufacturer factory and get one.

02:20:00.013 --> 02:20:01.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me finish my plea for a job.

02:20:02.474 --> 02:20:06.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear College Humor, contract me for $2,600 to do nothing but make fun of this guy.

02:20:08.318 --> 02:20:10.320
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise you I could do it for days on end.

02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:12.081
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never get tired.

02:20:14.169 --> 02:20:16.811
[SPEAKER_08]: YYR says that was some hardcore punography.

02:20:18.071 --> 02:20:19.792
[SPEAKER_08]: Punography.

02:20:20.673 --> 02:20:22.094
[SPEAKER_08]: It would only be if the pun was written.

02:20:23.234 --> 02:20:24.375
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the mailbag.

02:20:24.415 --> 02:20:27.016
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what lovely puns await us in the mailbag.

02:20:28.317 --> 02:20:30.078
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week you guys send us emails.

02:20:31.179 --> 02:20:36.642
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick a few of our favorite emails and read them here on the show.

02:20:36.702 --> 02:20:38.643
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what do we have tonight?

02:20:39.801 --> 02:20:41.065
[SPEAKER_03]: People Trippin'.

02:20:41.847 --> 02:20:44.796
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is titled, Damn Used Games.

02:20:46.650 --> 02:20:51.291
[SPEAKER_03]: And this comes from someone with a very unpronounceable name, so I'm just going to say, read the email.

02:20:51.771 --> 02:20:54.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, OLRcast, my name is Zyle Scott.

02:20:54.812 --> 02:20:55.092
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

02:20:55.112 --> 02:20:55.832
[SPEAKER_08]: You said the name.

02:20:56.133 --> 02:20:57.813
[SPEAKER_03]: He sold me to you.

02:20:57.833 --> 02:21:00.514
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put your name in the body of the email, I'm going to read it, okay?

02:21:01.274 --> 02:21:12.277
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering if any of you guys know of a website that I could print out cover art for used games that have lost their, it's not T-H-E-R-E, it's T-H-E-I-R, original case.

02:21:13.257 --> 02:21:16.720
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently bought a shitload of PS1 games and none of them have cover art.

02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:18.621
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me sad and annoyed.

02:21:19.161 --> 02:21:21.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, thanks and keep on with the great work.

02:21:21.323 --> 02:21:21.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Hugs and shit.

02:21:23.424 --> 02:21:25.486
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know of any sites per se.

02:21:25.766 --> 02:21:27.447
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazon, maybe, question mark.

02:21:27.467 --> 02:21:28.268
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even.

02:21:29.028 --> 02:21:30.870
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, you know what I do in his position?

02:21:31.810 --> 02:21:34.612
[SPEAKER_08]: Just go to Google Limits search and search for the game.

02:21:34.892 --> 02:21:35.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for large.

02:21:35.733 --> 02:21:36.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for large.

02:21:36.494 --> 02:21:37.694
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and do large.

02:21:38.095 --> 02:21:41.097
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't blow up a medium size because it'll look terrible when you print it out.

02:21:41.488 --> 02:21:47.570
[SPEAKER_03]: or you can pay me $2,600 and I will go get all the shit printed for you at King Ghost and it will all be nice.

02:21:48.671 --> 02:21:50.611
[SPEAKER_03]: You pay me triple that and I'll redraw it all for you.

02:21:51.372 --> 02:21:54.173
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, yeah, Google Image Search is what I would use.

02:21:54.893 --> 02:21:56.354
[SPEAKER_08]: Worst case scenario, Amazon.

02:21:57.074 --> 02:21:59.595
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you find a lot of missing CD covers.

02:21:59.675 --> 02:22:02.456
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't want it to look shitty, look for Hi-Rez.

02:22:03.136 --> 02:22:05.138
[SPEAKER_08]: Queen Simia in our chatroom says, draw your own.

02:22:05.198 --> 02:22:05.899
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the best.

02:22:05.999 --> 02:22:07.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:18.208
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Dracula X copy that Krista made us back in the day has her little stick figure Richter Belmont with flaily arms and a whip.

02:22:18.329 --> 02:22:19.630
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you know what this guy needs?

02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:24.273
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy needs video game covers done in Comic Sans and clip art.

02:22:24.854 --> 02:22:24.974
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah!

02:22:25.554 --> 02:22:26.295
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen this?

02:22:26.395 --> 02:22:27.075
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I have.

02:22:27.095 --> 02:22:28.676
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you need, sir.

02:22:28.756 --> 02:22:34.840
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to just forego the original covers and get comic sans and clip art redoes, reimaginings, because they're better.

02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:35.641
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it yourself.

02:22:35.701 --> 02:22:36.602
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be a fun project.

02:22:36.622 --> 02:22:37.162
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

02:22:37.983 --> 02:22:38.463
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

02:22:38.903 --> 02:22:39.724
[SPEAKER_08]: Make the best out of it.

02:22:39.744 --> 02:22:41.565
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, Rob, those make baby Satan cry.

02:22:43.726 --> 02:22:44.827
[SPEAKER_08]: Make baby Satan cry.

02:22:44.987 --> 02:22:45.067
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:22:45.087 --> 02:22:46.008
[SPEAKER_06]: Little fiery tears.

02:22:46.661 --> 02:22:47.622
[SPEAKER_03]: Little Tears of Lava

02:23:04.959 --> 02:23:08.944
[SPEAKER_08]: $150?

02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:08.944
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that guy got a pretty good deal then.

02:23:08.984 --> 02:23:10.545
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he didn't.

02:23:11.226 --> 02:23:13.409
[SPEAKER_08]: He got $600 of his bucks back and then $150.

02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:16.372
[SPEAKER_08]: He only lost two-thirds of his money.

02:23:17.113 --> 02:23:18.415
[SPEAKER_08]: For a carnival, that's not bad.

02:23:20.285 --> 02:23:22.226
[SPEAKER_08]: and he had tubs of fun, people.

02:23:22.466 --> 02:23:24.247
[SPEAKER_08]: Tubs of fun.

02:23:24.588 --> 02:23:29.890
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, I need to find those covers that Krista drew me back in the day and scan them in because they're freaking hilarious.

02:23:30.731 --> 02:23:33.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the one for Emerald Dragon that was pretty funny too.

02:23:33.272 --> 02:23:37.035
[SPEAKER_08]: Dungeon Buster in chat says someone who missed out on the Ni No Kuni Wizards book made his own.

02:23:37.075 --> 02:23:37.675
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awesome.

02:23:39.313 --> 02:23:42.834
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can still hire me and I will be more than happy to lay out anything you want me to.

02:23:42.854 --> 02:23:43.394
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it go.

02:23:43.474 --> 02:23:44.195
[SPEAKER_08]: Get to the next email.

02:23:44.535 --> 02:23:47.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I've actually got a job option.

02:23:47.616 --> 02:23:49.277
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

02:23:49.337 --> 02:23:51.978
[SPEAKER_08]: Just print your own Bananas with Dreadlocks for the cover.

02:23:52.038 --> 02:23:53.919
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy VII, Banana with Dreadlocks.

02:23:54.519 --> 02:23:57.440
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Banana with Spiky Mohawk for Final Fantasy VII.

02:23:57.700 --> 02:23:59.081
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be crying.

02:23:59.861 --> 02:24:03.203
[SPEAKER_06]: This year, instead of Spaced Ponchos, it's all about Bananas with Dreadlocks.

02:24:03.723 --> 02:24:04.743
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going to be the new trend.

02:24:04.763 --> 02:24:04.984
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

02:24:07.358 --> 02:24:09.739
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually, I was thinking of applying for the River Cats.

02:24:10.900 --> 02:24:11.160
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah?

02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:12.381
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a marketing position open.

02:24:12.641 --> 02:24:13.001
[SPEAKER_08]: They do.

02:24:13.621 --> 02:24:15.462
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a full year, full time.

02:24:15.582 --> 02:24:19.645
[SPEAKER_08]: My mom was telling me to go for an announcer position with them some time ago, and I was like, really?

02:24:19.705 --> 02:24:20.705
[SPEAKER_08]: Me announcing baseball?

02:24:20.825 --> 02:24:22.186
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you really see that?

02:24:22.426 --> 02:24:23.006
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be hilarious.

02:24:23.026 --> 02:24:27.289
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the guy, hit the ball, and things happen, and somebody just caught it.

02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:28.309
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God, y'all.

02:24:28.369 --> 02:24:29.730
[SPEAKER_08]: Balls are flying everywhere.

02:24:34.272 --> 02:24:36.913
[SPEAKER_03]: The pitcher just hit the batter.

02:24:37.793 --> 02:24:38.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Girl.

02:24:39.934 --> 02:24:40.434
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

02:24:40.834 --> 02:24:42.395
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, next email, dammit.

02:24:42.415 --> 02:24:43.295
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have one more.

02:24:44.236 --> 02:24:45.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, OLR.

02:24:45.516 --> 02:24:49.157
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got... What was that?

02:24:49.678 --> 02:24:51.938
[SPEAKER_03]: You went high and I lost my shit.

02:24:53.459 --> 02:24:55.140
[SPEAKER_08]: I was being nice to the listeners.

02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:56.840
[SPEAKER_08]: You said hello, I said hi.

02:24:56.860 --> 02:24:57.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:24:59.437 --> 02:25:01.198
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a question for all the hosts.

02:25:01.938 --> 02:25:11.344
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many games across all generations that have become known for their final boss fights, such as the Doomsday Zone and Sonic 3 and Knuckles or GLaDOS and Portal.

02:25:11.864 --> 02:25:15.566
[SPEAKER_03]: My question to you is which final boss fight in a game is your favorite?

02:25:16.187 --> 02:25:25.332
[SPEAKER_03]: As for mine, I know you guys don't like the game getting a lot of praise, but I absolutely love the final fight against Ganon in The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

02:25:26.052 --> 02:25:49.181
[SPEAKER_03]: from the moment he transforms into the beast that we knew from the previous games in the series the music sends chills down my spine as well as the setting of a fallen castle is surrounded in both flames and the crashes of lightning and thunder across the sky with Zelda standing watch sometimes screaming in fear when Link takes a blow from Ganon if you need your memory refreshed of why I think this fight is so awesome you can watch it here not clicking the link because I know

02:25:49.961 --> 02:25:52.043
[SPEAKER_03]: thanks for reading, Osfer P.S.

02:25:52.063 --> 02:26:16.264
[SPEAKER_08]: this email has been brought to you by me and my everlasting love of the show hosted by the gingerbread man I would say that when I was younger like it was probably this battle yes eat your damn vegetables you stupid frog cause the wart battle was pretty epic at that time like this music was just like oh my god he's gonna kill me

02:26:17.441 --> 02:26:18.924
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you feed him veggies and it's all good.

02:26:20.026 --> 02:26:23.472
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, maybe the Kefka battle in Final Fantasy VI was pretty damn epic.

02:26:24.615 --> 02:26:34.357
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly, not that the battle itself was epic, but the original Metal Gear on the NES, that whole ending sequence was pretty damn amazing.

02:26:35.017 --> 02:26:37.477
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you mentioned the Kefka battle.

02:26:38.317 --> 02:26:45.719
[SPEAKER_03]: It was waiting for Shadow at the end of the game that was like the big epic teaser.

02:26:46.379 --> 02:26:52.740
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I liked Final Fantasy VII's final battle because it was so fucking easy and I could make a sandwich.

02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:54.701
[SPEAKER_03]: while the whole thing was on autoplay.

02:26:55.922 --> 02:27:01.385
[SPEAKER_03]: God, there was another one, though, that I remember being completely happy with the ending.

02:27:01.445 --> 02:27:04.427
[SPEAKER_03]: More that I was with the last battle.

02:27:04.487 --> 02:27:04.887
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

02:27:05.148 --> 02:27:10.831
[SPEAKER_03]: I always like the last fights, the Wily fights in the Mega Man games because it is the stupidest weapon that you use.

02:27:11.011 --> 02:27:12.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man 3 used Top Man's weapon.

02:27:12.552 --> 02:27:13.133
[SPEAKER_08]: The fuck?

02:27:13.233 --> 02:27:15.014
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubble Man and Mega Man 2.

02:27:15.054 --> 02:27:16.855
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but Bubble Lead was actually useful.

02:27:16.975 --> 02:27:21.438
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was, but to shoot it to kill a boss in an empty room, that sucked.

02:27:23.552 --> 02:27:27.155
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting Topman and jumping on top of the Wily floater thing.

02:27:27.495 --> 02:27:28.596
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to kill him by topping him.

02:27:28.756 --> 02:27:29.757
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to top his floater.

02:27:32.399 --> 02:27:33.780
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a few.

02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:34.181
[SPEAKER_03]: There was.

02:27:34.221 --> 02:27:34.961
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what about you?

02:27:35.021 --> 02:27:35.782
[SPEAKER_08]: Epic boss battles?

02:27:35.962 --> 02:27:36.402
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember?

02:27:40.916 --> 02:27:42.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade

02:28:03.936 --> 02:28:04.256
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

02:28:19.256 --> 02:28:20.857
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

02:28:21.617 --> 02:28:22.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Say your prayers.

02:28:22.477 --> 02:28:25.539
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys gave me money to help them beat the game.

02:28:25.599 --> 02:28:28.660
[SPEAKER_03]: They paid for me to play as Leonardo because I was the only slot open.

02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:31.841
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had just beaten the game and the thing was just starting.

02:28:32.181 --> 02:28:33.622
[SPEAKER_03]: And they turned off all the machines because it was time to go.

02:28:33.742 --> 02:28:34.062
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

02:28:34.402 --> 02:28:34.922
[SPEAKER_06]: Assholes.

02:28:35.322 --> 02:28:36.603
[SPEAKER_06]: I know one epic boss battle.

02:28:36.663 --> 02:28:38.203
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my revenge because I got to do the same thing.

02:28:38.644 --> 02:28:38.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Max 300.

02:28:38.924 --> 02:28:41.665
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty epic getting to that.

02:28:43.565 --> 02:28:44.606
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I can consider that.

02:28:44.786 --> 02:28:46.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, shoot.

02:28:46.827 --> 02:28:47.547
[SPEAKER_08]: The Legend of Max?

02:28:47.967 --> 02:28:49.528
[SPEAKER_03]: No, um, RoboZ.

02:28:51.790 --> 02:28:52.591
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, Bust a Move.

02:28:53.812 --> 02:28:57.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember that, you're going through the game and everybody's your size and everything.

02:28:59.936 --> 02:29:01.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull up, pull up, find your soul.

02:29:02.438 --> 02:29:02.819
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick.

02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:06.742
[SPEAKER_03]: And for anyone who hasn't played the game, like, um...

02:29:08.884 --> 02:29:11.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Busta Move that came out in the U.S.

02:29:13.089 --> 02:29:13.490
[SPEAKER_03]: In the U.S.

02:29:13.530 --> 02:29:14.351
[SPEAKER_03]: it was Busta Groove.

02:29:15.012 --> 02:29:16.193
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan it was Busta Move.

02:29:22.927 --> 02:29:43.219
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're on a building you're this little teeny tiny thing with a robot like this bigger than the building like twice the size of the building it was epic you have cars running off the edges and all this shit and oh my god that was the best game alright good email thank you

02:29:43.875 --> 02:29:48.539
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to say that Robozy is my number one favorite boss battle.

02:29:48.699 --> 02:29:49.080
[SPEAKER_08]: Good answer.

02:29:49.560 --> 02:29:55.725
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, if that's it for emails, mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you want to get in on a future email bag segment.

02:29:56.746 --> 02:29:58.908
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us get to the FUs of the week.

02:29:58.948 --> 02:30:00.890
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the part of the show where we get angsty.

02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.430
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

02:30:03.072 --> 02:30:03.412
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

02:30:18.803 --> 02:30:19.284
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two.

02:30:20.225 --> 02:30:21.627
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one goes towards me.

02:30:21.667 --> 02:30:22.928
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm fighting off something.

02:30:23.469 --> 02:30:25.111
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just probably going to take it easy tomorrow.

02:30:27.214 --> 02:30:36.185
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that I'm just a little worn down because I've maybe gotten five hours of sleep last night and the night before and then went to the baseball game yesterday and was up all night and busy.

02:30:37.086 --> 02:30:38.007
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually I have three.

02:30:38.747 --> 02:30:42.830
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns out that my wheat and corn allergy is a lot worse than I thought.

02:30:43.370 --> 02:30:46.972
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, the only reason I eat anything wheat today is because I took plenty of Benadryl before the show.

02:30:47.632 --> 02:30:51.034
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that it's definitely going to have to get cut out altogether.

02:30:51.314 --> 02:30:54.756
[SPEAKER_03]: And I keep pushing it and I'm just happier without it, you know.

02:30:55.577 --> 02:30:57.038
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't stopped me from having ice cream.

02:30:57.378 --> 02:30:59.679
[SPEAKER_03]: I can have ice cream as long as I don't have cookies in my ice cream.

02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:01.660
[SPEAKER_08]: Cookies are good though.

02:31:02.341 --> 02:31:05.102
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I can get gluten free cookies.

02:31:05.363 --> 02:31:05.723
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

02:31:06.597 --> 02:31:13.499
[SPEAKER_03]: and the other one goes towards there not being an actual third Bust-a-Move game.

02:31:15.219 --> 02:31:16.180
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not counting Dance Summit.

02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:17.480
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not counting Dance Summit.

02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:20.141
[SPEAKER_03]: We need an actual new Bust-a-Move game.

02:31:20.541 --> 02:31:32.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Squeenix, dear squa part of Enix, when you absorbed the Enix to become the conglomerate of Squeenix, you also inherited the Bust-a-Move series.

02:31:32.744 --> 02:31:33.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Do something with it!

02:31:34.865 --> 02:31:35.105
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

02:31:35.441 --> 02:31:35.721
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

02:31:36.761 --> 02:31:37.762
[SPEAKER_06]: I feeded your water.

02:31:38.362 --> 02:31:41.283
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what it is with your water that makes me have cotton mouth.

02:31:42.383 --> 02:31:43.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get the stuff out of the filter?

02:31:43.863 --> 02:31:44.403
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you need.

02:31:44.763 --> 02:31:45.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Filter water.

02:31:45.404 --> 02:31:46.284
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from the tap.

02:31:46.384 --> 02:31:46.964
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:31:47.024 --> 02:31:48.504
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ever drink tap water.

02:31:48.524 --> 02:31:52.405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they do something to control our minds.

02:31:53.706 --> 02:31:54.046
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it?

02:31:55.086 --> 02:31:55.667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it.

02:31:55.788 --> 02:32:00.216
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and thank you, my son, for trying to hit me in the nuts with the frisbee.

02:32:00.717 --> 02:32:02.240
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever been headbutted by your son?

02:32:03.923 --> 02:32:05.125
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but that was in my head.

02:32:07.605 --> 02:32:13.669
[SPEAKER_03]: Becky was telling me about when Julian was like two, he would run in while Chris was playing Xbox games and headbutt him in the crotch.

02:32:13.950 --> 02:32:14.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:15.691
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an accident.

02:32:15.751 --> 02:32:19.794
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't know how to throw a frisbee correctly yet, so he threw it behind him.

02:32:19.995 --> 02:32:20.475
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll learn him.

02:32:21.556 --> 02:32:22.196
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a good kid.

02:32:22.477 --> 02:32:31.023
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, my FU of the week goes to the fact that Alan made all these french fries before the show and I ate them all and this is why I'm fat.

02:32:31.464 --> 02:32:33.826
[SPEAKER_08]: But they were so good.

02:32:35.512 --> 02:32:40.974
[SPEAKER_08]: Two more stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:41.034 --> 02:32:41.574
[SPEAKER_08]: Two more stories.

02:32:41.674 --> 02:32:41.894
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

02:32:42.174 --> 02:32:47.055
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they announced a brand new exclusive game coming to the OUYA.

02:32:47.875 --> 02:32:52.977
[SPEAKER_06]: It's being done by Kim Swift and Airtight Games, who did Quantum Conundrum.

02:32:53.517 --> 02:32:54.798
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul Fjord Soul Fjord

02:33:23.062 --> 02:33:27.563
[SPEAKER_08]: One more story for you guys, and this is about a very interesting demake of a game.

02:33:28.243 --> 02:33:30.804
[SPEAKER_08]: And this kind of blows my mind, actually.

02:33:31.644 --> 02:33:35.545
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, in China, they tend to do this bootleg software.

02:33:36.285 --> 02:33:41.727
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of times it's current titles that they cram into these 8-bit carts, and usually they're hacks or things like that.

02:33:41.767 --> 02:33:45.027
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, we've seen Tekken, the 8-bit version, and all this crazy shit, right?

02:33:45.047 --> 02:33:45.848
[SPEAKER_06]: Tai Chi, the RPG.

02:33:45.908 --> 02:33:46.328
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right?

02:33:46.368 --> 02:33:47.468
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, all this crazy shit, right?

02:33:47.808 --> 02:33:49.729
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's an interesting one they did recently.

02:33:49.829 --> 02:33:52.291
[SPEAKER_08]: They demaked Final Fantasy IV.

02:33:52.671 --> 02:33:54.893
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Super Nintendo Final Fantasy IV.

02:33:55.393 --> 02:33:58.395
[SPEAKER_08]: They demade it for the Famicom.

02:33:58.575 --> 02:34:02.578
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a smoker, I have a tip for you.

02:34:02.618 --> 02:34:06.361
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't play the smoking commercial.

02:34:06.661 --> 02:34:08.282
[SPEAKER_03]: That always made me think of Dennis Leary.

02:34:08.342 --> 02:34:12.505
[SPEAKER_08]: Goddammit, I just wanted to see the stupid demake and I got a stupid commercial.

02:34:12.545 --> 02:34:14.006
[SPEAKER_03]: I want meat from only cows that smoke.

02:34:14.722 --> 02:34:15.022
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

02:34:35.791 --> 02:34:37.711
[SPEAKER_03]: You can whitelist your favorite internet access.

02:34:37.731 --> 02:34:39.912
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm going to blacklist those sons of bitches.

02:34:39.972 --> 02:34:42.973
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, because if I can't turn the volume down.

02:34:43.033 --> 02:34:51.115
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, the soundtrack has been shoved into the 8-bit cartridges very well, which is really amazing.

02:34:51.215 --> 02:34:54.956
[SPEAKER_08]: And for 8-bit, it looks pretty good, I got to say.

02:34:55.336 --> 02:34:59.757
[SPEAKER_08]: They've spread it across three cartridges, though, because, you know, Super Nintendo versus Nintendo.

02:35:00.377 --> 02:35:05.278
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the light game, the dark game, and the, I don't know, the end game or something like that.

02:35:05.898 --> 02:35:34.671
[SPEAKER_08]: and because you can't transfer saves from one to the other it basically recaps the story when you start one of the and start your characters at an appropriate level so you can play them in any order you want it's just fascinating that somebody did a lot of work to do that for the Famicom cool imagine if they had focused themselves onto like making an original game I know right so there you go who does original things anymore please

02:35:36.277 --> 02:35:36.737
[SPEAKER_08]: What the Lump

02:35:52.881 --> 02:35:58.506
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:35:58.526 --> 02:36:01.468
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to give us a call and we can talk about whatever.

02:36:01.488 --> 02:36:07.693
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to talk about demakes, you want to talk about remakes, you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight or something else, give us a call.

02:36:07.813 --> 02:36:11.456
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:36:11.856 --> 02:36:14.238
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, I've got some tweets I want to read for you guys.

02:36:15.519 --> 02:36:15.679
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

02:36:43.712 --> 02:36:44.772
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's go to the phones.

02:36:44.912 --> 02:36:45.393
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ringing.

02:36:46.633 --> 02:36:47.734
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

02:36:47.774 --> 02:36:48.114
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

02:36:48.695 --> 02:36:49.875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one and only Ranma.

02:36:49.955 --> 02:36:50.816
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma.

02:36:50.876 --> 02:36:52.016
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

02:36:52.757 --> 02:36:53.377
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

02:36:53.597 --> 02:36:54.338
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

02:36:54.738 --> 02:36:56.779
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know that smoking is bad for you?

02:36:57.900 --> 02:36:58.480
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, yes it is.

02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:00.922
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I smoke other things, but that's not why I call.

02:37:01.782 --> 02:37:03.483
[SPEAKER_04]: An endorsement from Mr. Spanky.

02:37:03.663 --> 02:37:04.364
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did you call?

02:37:05.919 --> 02:37:06.820
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the coffee on.

02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:07.540
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta talk.

02:37:08.821 --> 02:37:09.982
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get the cheesecake.

02:37:10.903 --> 02:37:11.904
[SPEAKER_04]: Fabulous, darling.

02:37:11.984 --> 02:37:12.564
[SPEAKER_08]: Fabulous.

02:37:13.025 --> 02:37:13.505
[SPEAKER_08]: What is up?

02:37:13.665 --> 02:37:14.426
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you want to talk about?

02:37:14.946 --> 02:37:20.271
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm coming home on the train and I tune in right about time when you and Loki are talking about piracy and everything.

02:37:22.698 --> 02:37:40.153
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand both sides of this, because even in my world that I cover, we have to deal with entitlement kids who feel that they shouldn't have to pay for anything because it's quote-unquote free and available, but when those series are licensed, they don't want to pony up the 20 or 30 bucks to buy the entire series.

02:37:40.433 --> 02:37:41.614
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, you're talking about anime.

02:37:42.394 --> 02:37:42.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:37:43.235 --> 02:37:46.037
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming to the point, it's a financial aspect, because...

02:37:47.233 --> 02:37:49.175
[SPEAKER_04]: Truth be told, it's just me.

02:37:49.235 --> 02:37:57.223
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to drop $300 and $400 on a new console knowing that the games are going to be $50, $60, and $70.

02:37:57.764 --> 02:38:00.406
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's a way to pirate it, so be it.

02:38:01.287 --> 02:38:09.055
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if the game is like $5, $6, people are still going to pirate it because that's $5, $6 that they're going to keep and put towards something else.

02:38:11.912 --> 02:38:13.213
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:38:31.795 --> 02:38:35.879
[SPEAKER_04]: I think more people would have bought it at $5 and at $60.

02:38:35.959 --> 02:38:38.120
[SPEAKER_08]: More, but would it be 12 times as many?

02:38:38.181 --> 02:38:40.362
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's got to be more than 12 times as many.

02:38:40.923 --> 02:38:45.747
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think it is because it's coming down to where it costs consensus.

02:38:45.867 --> 02:38:46.207
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

02:38:47.173 --> 02:38:54.418
[SPEAKER_04]: Most... Almost every single PS3, 360 game I own, I paid anywhere between $20 and $40.

02:38:55.799 --> 02:39:01.963
[SPEAKER_04]: One or two, I paid retail price only because it was a game that I wanted or I got a gift card for it.

02:39:02.764 --> 02:39:03.264
[SPEAKER_04]: Done and done.

02:39:04.906 --> 02:39:05.106
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:39:06.307 --> 02:39:13.972
[SPEAKER_04]: And as for, you know, releasing the game on the Pirate Bay free like that... See, there's one thing about that.

02:39:15.033 --> 02:39:16.554
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see this game...

02:39:17.708 --> 02:39:32.405
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to check the comments within the first 5 or 6 comments somebody's going to be like oh this game has a hack in it don't download, don't download, don't download then you're going to go find another torrent where it's the full game and you're going to grab that

02:39:34.019 --> 02:39:41.084
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what I understand about this particular story, though, is that the author put it up and it was downloaded so many times so fast.

02:39:41.504 --> 02:39:45.447
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't figure out what's going on until you've played the game for a little bit.

02:39:46.167 --> 02:39:46.487
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

02:39:46.928 --> 02:39:55.834
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say, you know, like within an hour or so, people are going to go back to that torrent and be like, oh, don't download because... Yeah, but in an hour, it's been downloaded 5,000 times already.

02:39:56.314 --> 02:39:58.415
[SPEAKER_04]: And the sad part is that that torrent is still going.

02:39:58.776 --> 02:40:01.698
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're smart, you're going to stop that and just jump onto something else.

02:40:01.818 --> 02:40:02.318
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right.

02:40:02.838 --> 02:40:02.998
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:40:04.901 --> 02:40:07.104
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, anything else you wanted to share with listeners tonight?

02:40:09.167 --> 02:40:10.870
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... No, not really.

02:40:11.491 --> 02:40:11.752
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

02:40:11.772 --> 02:40:16.098
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to get that off my chest and agree with y'all about this whole piracy thing, and...

02:40:18.930 --> 02:40:22.411
[SPEAKER_08]: Where can I come give you a hug at an anime convention coming up soon?

02:40:22.471 --> 02:40:25.412
[SPEAKER_08]: You going to any anime conventions in the next couple weeks?

02:40:25.912 --> 02:40:31.974
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be kidnapping the entire staff, putting them in Snake's box, and dragging them to anime next in June.

02:40:32.314 --> 02:40:32.674
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

02:40:33.374 --> 02:40:34.675
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you were coming to Fanime.

02:40:34.695 --> 02:40:35.895
[SPEAKER_04]: It would give me a reason to go.

02:40:36.815 --> 02:40:41.617
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I have my own personal reasons that I'm taking time off for this month.

02:40:41.937 --> 02:40:43.017
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I understand.

02:40:43.477 --> 02:40:45.158
[SPEAKER_08]: VXJSnakesV is going to be there, so...

02:40:46.272 --> 02:40:49.134
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still unpacking the shoebox studio, okay?

02:40:49.394 --> 02:40:49.774
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:40:49.834 --> 02:40:50.354
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

02:40:50.454 --> 02:40:50.774
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

02:40:50.795 --> 02:40:51.555
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have to pout?

02:40:52.115 --> 02:40:52.315
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:40:52.335 --> 02:40:53.056
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll do it anyway.

02:40:53.636 --> 02:40:53.936
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:40:54.416 --> 02:40:55.117
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, take care, Ranma.

02:40:55.137 --> 02:40:55.617
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the call.

02:40:56.157 --> 02:40:56.758
[SPEAKER_08]: You got it, bro.

02:40:56.858 --> 02:40:57.098
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:40:57.138 --> 02:40:57.398
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

02:40:57.818 --> 02:40:58.719
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

02:40:58.739 --> 02:41:02.261
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:03.741 --> 02:41:07.523
[SPEAKER_08]: Also from Tigerclaw, another tweet about Zone of the Enders sequel on hold.

02:41:07.543 --> 02:41:12.004
[SPEAKER_08]: The team was disbanded due to issues with the HD remake.

02:41:12.424 --> 02:41:13.985
[SPEAKER_08]: Did their zone get ended?

02:41:15.045 --> 02:41:15.965
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was.

02:41:16.485 --> 02:41:16.906
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

02:41:18.046 --> 02:41:24.228
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually from Hideo Kojima himself on Hideo blog, the radio show that he does online, his little podcast.

02:41:25.009 --> 02:41:33.480
[SPEAKER_08]: The proposed sequel on Zone of the Enders was ceased, and this was because the HD collection issues were the reasons behind the stop and development.

02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:38.687
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess this doesn't mean that it can't come back later, but for right now, nope!

02:41:41.031 --> 02:41:41.271
[SPEAKER_08]: Bummer.

02:41:43.017 --> 02:41:47.702
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:41:48.843 --> 02:41:58.654
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt tweeted us something about Grant Kirkhope, who's the composer of Perfect Dark and Banjo-Kazooie, I thought you mentioned this earlier, offering their soundtracks up for Pay-As-You-Want.

02:41:58.674 --> 02:42:00.115
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we have that Perfect Dark story earlier?

02:42:01.837 --> 02:42:02.778
[SPEAKER_08]: Or did we skip it tonight?

02:42:03.499 --> 02:42:04.920
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess I didn't show all that after all.

02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:07.002
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to cover this, but apparently not.

02:42:07.322 --> 02:42:08.342
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can check this out.

02:42:08.463 --> 02:42:13.946
[SPEAKER_08]: GrantKirkHope.Bandcamp.com Pay as you want for Perfect Dark and Banjo-Kazooie.

02:42:14.907 --> 02:42:17.549
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect Dark had a pretty good soundtrack, at least I know.

02:42:17.589 --> 02:42:20.851
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play a lot of Banjo-Kazooie, but I've played a lot of Perfect Dark on 360.

02:42:22.603 --> 02:42:25.825
[SPEAKER_08]: with SSJ100Matt when he had his little trolling device that worked.

02:42:26.926 --> 02:42:34.190
[SPEAKER_08]: Redertainment wants to know on Twitter, is there a reason the Christian right hasn't flipped their shit about the various religious comments in Bioshock Infinite?

02:42:35.730 --> 02:42:42.594
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the Westboro Baptist Church is getting ready to protest that Slayer guy's funeral, so that's probably what they're preoccupied with doing.

02:42:42.855 --> 02:42:45.856
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, what a stupid idea.

02:42:46.276 --> 02:42:47.357
[SPEAKER_08]: What a stupid idea.

02:42:48.037 --> 02:42:50.479
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess I should take a step back even further.

02:42:50.999 --> 02:43:15.934
[SPEAKER_08]: How unfortunate that that guy passed away and what sounds like what's really like a freak thing like you first hear that the guy dies a liver failure and he can't help but think oh yeah rock and roll lifestyle right liver failure but it turns out he may have got like a spider bite a couple years ago that led to this because he didn't get a treat like it's crazy stuff I don't know if you guys have read about it very sad stuff obviously Slayer has these hardcore fans that will carve the name of the band into their various

02:43:17.878 --> 02:43:21.908
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Westboro Baptist Church is going to go protest this guy's funeral.

02:43:24.002 --> 02:43:24.522
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

02:43:25.403 --> 02:43:26.103
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll need it.

02:43:26.244 --> 02:43:27.404
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be violent.

02:43:28.505 --> 02:43:29.986
[SPEAKER_08]: But nobody's going to care.

02:43:30.087 --> 02:43:31.408
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be the hilarious part.

02:43:34.890 --> 02:43:36.511
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so screw the Westboro Baptist Church.

02:43:36.531 --> 02:43:38.793
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, back to the question that was really asked by Redertainment.

02:43:39.154 --> 02:43:43.677
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a reason the Christian right hasn't flipped their shit about the various religious comments in Bioshock Infinite?

02:43:44.117 --> 02:43:45.478
[SPEAKER_08]: Bigger fish to fry right now?

02:43:45.558 --> 02:43:46.399
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think, Loki?

02:43:46.799 --> 02:43:47.900
[SPEAKER_08]: You've played Bioshock Infinite.

02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:49.762
[SPEAKER_08]: Why hasn't the religious right started complaining yet?

02:43:50.402 --> 02:43:51.763
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they would complain about it.

02:43:51.803 --> 02:43:53.143
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, it's fictional.

02:43:53.663 --> 02:44:03.387
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really think it's going to be, I don't know, it's not necessarily like saying religion's bad, it's just they're extreme in the scenarios of the game.

02:44:04.147 --> 02:44:06.148
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

02:44:06.288 --> 02:44:08.929
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they would waste their time on that.

02:44:09.049 --> 02:44:10.009
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're not PETA.

02:44:10.249 --> 02:44:15.691
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess, you know, if animals are getting hurt or something like that, then maybe, you know, they'd come after them.

02:44:16.158 --> 02:44:19.400
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for example, if that horse scene was still there, maybe they would come after him.

02:44:21.020 --> 02:44:22.581
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think they care.

02:44:22.681 --> 02:44:23.442
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they're aware of it.

02:44:23.462 --> 02:44:24.642
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they'll bring it up later on.

02:44:24.982 --> 02:44:31.906
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like how those gun makers or whatever get pissed off at, oh, that postal game, it's making people violent.

02:44:31.946 --> 02:44:36.068
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, wait about 10 years and then they'll finally catch up and start complaining about it.

02:44:36.088 --> 02:44:37.649
[SPEAKER_06]: That Bioshock Infinite game is like, what?

02:44:37.669 --> 02:44:38.009
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

02:44:38.029 --> 02:44:40.230
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just now getting around to, you know, Super Mario World.

02:44:40.250 --> 02:44:43.572
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto 3 is so violent.

02:44:45.154 --> 02:44:47.235
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I think that was it for Twitter topics tonight.

02:44:47.555 --> 02:44:49.116
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, wait, I want to go back.

02:44:49.136 --> 02:44:50.317
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I saw stuff earlier in the week.

02:44:50.677 --> 02:44:56.339
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go to Loki and ask if you have any last-minute stories first.

02:44:56.359 --> 02:45:01.982
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a fan-made Duke Nukem Forever mod being released for Duke Nukem 3D.

02:45:02.022 --> 02:45:09.626
[SPEAKER_06]: It's based off the original footage from the 2001 E3 trailer, and you can download it for free.

02:45:10.586 --> 02:45:19.190
[SPEAKER_06]: on moddb.com slash mod slash duke-nukum-forever and you just need a copy of Duke Nukem 3D.

02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:20.651
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you play that on Steam yet?

02:45:21.731 --> 02:45:22.211
[SPEAKER_08]: Multiplayer?

02:45:24.132 --> 02:45:26.053
[SPEAKER_08]: You can download it.

02:45:26.093 --> 02:45:26.633
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm waiting for that.

02:45:27.013 --> 02:45:31.135
[SPEAKER_08]: I found the tweets that I was looking for that I knew had come earlier in the week.

02:45:31.255 --> 02:45:33.176
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they're all the tweets I'm looking for.

02:45:33.776 --> 02:45:35.418
[SPEAKER_08]: YYR tweeted us earlier in the week

02:45:56.574 --> 02:46:17.900
[SPEAKER_08]: too soon to tell I get the comparisons with the whole fact that what didn't they also not make Madden on the Dreamcast or one of the big sports games didn't didn't make its way over there and that was kind of the beginning of the end but I think there was a lot of other stuff that came into play too I don't even think it's necessarily comparable because spec wise I don't think it's comparable at all with the next gen systems I think it's more like the current gen stuff

02:46:18.380 --> 02:46:20.061
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of an in-between thing.

02:46:20.641 --> 02:46:27.585
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's their next generation of that console, but I wouldn't compare it to the next-gen gaming systems.

02:46:28.145 --> 02:46:31.827
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to be able to do what they do on those systems on that system.

02:46:32.688 --> 02:46:35.169
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, last call for calls.

02:46:35.189 --> 02:46:37.990
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:38.431 --> 02:46:39.071
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, anything else?

02:46:40.492 --> 02:46:42.293
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega Man Unlimited looks cool.

02:46:42.393 --> 02:46:43.373
[SPEAKER_06]: They got a new trailer for it.

02:46:43.433 --> 02:46:44.994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another fan-made game.

02:46:47.595 --> 02:46:49.336
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it'll get shut down by Capcom.

02:46:51.457 --> 02:46:53.979
[SPEAKER_08]: Earthbound 4, apparently having a fan game.

02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:59.484
[SPEAKER_08]: The creator said on Twitter this week, I want to say, I'm not doing it.

02:46:59.604 --> 02:47:00.164
[SPEAKER_08]: Not happening.

02:47:00.664 --> 02:47:01.785
[SPEAKER_08]: Very difficult to happen.

02:47:03.046 --> 02:47:04.928
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of think you should never say never, but...

02:47:06.889 --> 02:47:08.772
[SPEAKER_08]: getting more games in the Mother series.

02:47:08.832 --> 02:47:09.753
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I should say EarthBound 4.

02:47:09.933 --> 02:47:10.855
[SPEAKER_08]: It's technically Mother 4.

02:47:10.955 --> 02:47:11.235
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

02:47:11.315 --> 02:47:13.138
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Pyrrhus, but Mother 4.

02:47:13.218 --> 02:47:14.379
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

02:47:14.399 --> 02:47:17.624
[SPEAKER_06]: He could very well just put out an EarthBound game.

02:47:18.245 --> 02:47:18.765
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha!

02:47:19.226 --> 02:47:21.048
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say anything about EarthBound.

02:47:25.399 --> 02:47:27.861
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well I guess no other calls tonight.

02:47:28.302 --> 02:47:29.403
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all have been shy lately.

02:47:29.443 --> 02:47:31.224
[SPEAKER_08]: We barely got any calls last week either.

02:47:32.065 --> 02:47:32.686
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up with that?

02:47:33.006 --> 02:47:34.748
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:47:35.368 --> 02:47:36.029
[SPEAKER_08]: If you use it.

02:47:36.750 --> 02:47:38.872
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'll shut down the Skype line for now.

02:47:38.912 --> 02:47:45.398
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think of something later you want to send us your thoughts, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or of course it's always Twitter.

02:47:45.418 --> 02:47:46.839
[SPEAKER_08]: We might stick a banana with dreadlocks on them.

02:47:47.239 --> 02:47:48.781
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm hoping the Skype connection works.

02:47:48.841 --> 02:47:49.682
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe something's wrong there.

02:47:49.722 --> 02:47:50.602
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have tested it.

02:47:51.603 --> 02:47:54.726
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow, we got what Rama got through, so I know at least one of it's working.

02:47:55.567 --> 02:47:56.628
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else, Loki, you want to get out?

02:47:57.989 --> 02:47:58.249
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

02:47:58.970 --> 02:47:59.050
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

02:47:59.771 --> 02:48:01.692
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I guess that brings us to the end of the show.

02:48:03.594 --> 02:48:04.175
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.

02:48:04.595 --> 02:48:09.199
[SPEAKER_08]: A little earlier than usual tonight, but it's only supposed to be about a three-hour show with a break included, so that's all right.

02:48:10.100 --> 02:48:15.445
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank you guys for tuning out tonight, or tuning out, turning out tonight and tuning in.

02:48:15.465 --> 02:48:15.965
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

02:48:16.626 --> 02:48:17.527
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you can tune out.

02:48:18.608 --> 02:48:19.068
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

02:48:36.908 --> 02:48:39.851
[SPEAKER_08]: Support indie podcasting and help the community grow.

02:48:40.291 --> 02:48:43.413
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to help our podcast grow, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:48:43.954 --> 02:48:45.275
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave a nice review on iTunes.

02:48:45.355 --> 02:48:49.118
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs up on Stitcher and listening time on there really helps go a long way as well.

02:48:49.558 --> 02:48:50.579
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, really appreciate it.

02:48:50.919 --> 02:48:53.961
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we close up shop tonight, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:48:54.522 --> 02:48:55.543
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

02:48:55.623 --> 02:48:56.203
[SPEAKER_08]: Your final thought.

02:49:00.146 --> 02:49:00.847
[SPEAKER_08]: Exclamation point.

02:49:01.467 --> 02:49:02.608
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:49:03.171 --> 02:49:08.976
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thought is I have a lot of money to spend on Amazon soon and I don't know what to get.

02:49:10.817 --> 02:49:14.720
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I should have made you buy me that IK and I spent 40 bucks on this weekend.

02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:15.641
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that, it's an IK.

02:49:15.821 --> 02:49:25.209
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, speaking of IK, what they should do is actually come out with some sort of pinball version of it, you know, use the screen as pinball and have the flippers and stuff and have a pinball game that supports it.

02:49:25.289 --> 02:49:26.510
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're talking my language.

02:49:26.550 --> 02:49:27.010
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

02:49:27.731 --> 02:49:28.011
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.

02:49:28.992 --> 02:49:31.013
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet there's a pinball game that supports IK though.

02:49:31.614 --> 02:49:31.734
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

02:49:31.974 --> 02:49:33.655
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just go with pin maim and leave it at that.

02:49:33.995 --> 02:49:34.355
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

02:49:34.475 --> 02:49:41.978
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised they don't have pin maim on the iPad somehow, even though the Apple Gestapo locks everything down.

02:49:41.998 --> 02:49:45.999
[SPEAKER_03]: There is the whole, what is it, just called Pinball Arcade?

02:49:46.019 --> 02:49:47.179
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I've got it on here.

02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:49.580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Pinball Arcade, which is pretty good.

02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:51.641
[SPEAKER_03]: If it had arcade support, it would be awesome.

02:49:51.781 --> 02:49:52.141
[SPEAKER_08]: Be nice.

02:49:53.121 --> 02:49:53.422
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:49:54.922 --> 02:49:55.802
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's it, guys.

02:49:56.143 --> 02:49:56.563
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done.

02:49:58.383 --> 02:50:00.164
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:50:00.424 --> 02:50:01.024
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, you guys.

02:50:01.104 --> 02:50:02.524
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back to do it again next week.

02:50:02.884 --> 02:50:03.504
[SPEAKER_08]: Episode 504.

02:50:04.044 --> 02:50:06.565
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping we'll have an interview next week, so stay tuned to Twitter.

02:50:06.885 --> 02:50:09.345
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you more about that as soon as I have that confirmed for this week.

02:50:09.866 --> 02:50:11.586
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the meantime, have fun gaming.

02:50:11.946 --> 02:50:13.746
[SPEAKER_08]: Thursday night, Forza Horizon, right?

02:50:13.766 --> 02:50:15.807
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Forza Horizon at 8 p.m.

02:50:15.827 --> 02:50:17.107
[SPEAKER_08]: Pacific Standard Time.

02:50:17.167 --> 02:50:20.508
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mass Effect 3 at 5.30.

02:50:20.888 --> 02:50:22.988
[SPEAKER_08]: All three of us broadcasting throughout the week.

02:50:23.268 --> 02:50:26.669
[SPEAKER_08]: So tune into our channels and check that out.

02:50:27.421 --> 02:50:28.565
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great week everybody.

02:50:28.585 --> 02:50:31.053
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next time with more of Orange Launch Radio.

02:50:31.153 --> 02:50:31.434
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.

02:50:32.239 --> 02:50:35.241
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:35.881 --> 02:50:40.104
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

02:50:40.685 --> 02:50:49.551
