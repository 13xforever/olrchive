7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, May 12, 2013, Sony makes moves to grab more indies, XSeed and Atlas combined, and we talk to John G, the creator of the Zelda documentary, It's Dangerous to Go Alone.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May the 12th of 2013, episode number 504 of our show.
46000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and all things gaming and so forth, culture, blah blah blah, lolz.
54000	58000	With my co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
58000	62000	Blar. Blar. Blar.
62000	65000	What happened? Did you eat at Panda Express again?
65000	69000	No, I have my own delicious food, but this week's been shitty.
70000	75000	Well, that's why you're gonna lose yourself in a super fun chipper episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
75000	85000	I would try, but if I may make an announcement to one of our people in chat tonight for Name & Lights, we offer you our condolences. It's a very difficult thing you're going through.
85000	94000	Absolutely, so you know, it's the extended family here at VoG and we're thinking of you guys when you guys have really horrific weeks too.
94000	99000	But not having a bad week, I hope, is Techmaster Loki joining us as well.
99000	111000	I was having a great week, up until lunch, because McDonald's, man, I swear, their quality assurance, I swear, their quality assurance is so bad you'd think that they were Bethesda or something.
112000	114000	Don't say funny stuff while I'm eating.
114000	120000	Just kidding, no, Bethesda's awesome, they check their games way more than McDonald's checks what's actually in the bag.
121000	124000	That's your job, you're supposed to check what's in the bag.
124000	127000	I'm supposed to see the quality assurance, yeah, that's how it works.
127000	131000	Don't you see the little sign as you pull it out of the drive-thru, check your order, bitch.
131000	136000	Here's what was missing. First off, they didn't give me sweet and sour sauce, because we had a ton of nuggets.
136000	144000	Then they forgot to give me the nuggets for the Happy Meal for Josh. The main portion of his meal is missing, and my drink.
145000	149000	It might be like a whole other bag somewhere, but anyway, you've got real problems.
149000	151000	You've got real problems, Loki, real problems.
152000	162000	Anyhow, also joining us, say hello to the chatters. We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
162000	167000	And you can join us in chat at live.vog.net.com if you happen to be listening to us live.
167000	174000	Speaking of Bobby Black Wolf, we always do a little phone call with him at the end of every show, and I forgot during the phone call tonight,
174000	181000	because I got distracted by Loki's late arrival, but I forgot to wish Bobby Black Wolf a happy birthday.
181000	183000	Happy anniversary of your hatching.
183000	188000	That's right. His 29th birthday is today for the seventh or eighth time.
188000	194000	He actually has me convinced he's 29 now. He keeps lying about it every year, but we hope you have a great birthday.
194000	199000	I wrote him a Commodore 64 BASIC program for his birthday on Facebook.
199000	200000	Is it the bouncing ball?
200000	207000	I haven't done that in a long time. No, it just, it prints happy birthday 29 times and then says, sorry, this program will only count to 29.
207000	208000	Oh.
208000	209000	There you go.
212000	216000	I need to do more programming. I haven't done a lot of that in a long, long, long time.
217000	219000	So, but I'm too busy doing a radio show. What can I say?
220000	231000	So anyway, happy birthday to Bobby Black Wolf. Also, happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there, whether that be, you know, having kids, having pets.
231000	232000	Kitty moms, kitty moms.
232000	239000	Mother figures, Mr. Moms, you know, whatever, grandmoms, moms-to-be, all those things.
239000	246000	Happy Mother's Day to all of you and hope you forgot, or hope you forgot, hope you didn't forget to call your mother.
246000	247000	Yeah.
247000	249000	So, or whoever is important to you on this day.
249000	253000	I texted mine today and tried to call her and I sent grandmama a text.
253000	259000	I haven't been super hubble about it, but my grandmoms in the hospital, which is why I'm going to Alabama.
259000	260000	Right.
260000	263000	So I sent my grandmama a text and then I got a call from my granny after I left her message.
263000	266000	So I have spoken with maternal people in my life.
266000	267000	Good.
267000	271000	And as has my husband. Spoken with his maternal figure and her maternal figure.
271000	277000	Now, I called my mom, but we're doing Mother's Day stuff tomorrow because my mom is very much like, well, not just because of this show.
277000	279000	I mean, I mean, she would understand that.
279000	283000	But I didn't take her out to brunch or anything because she hates the crowds at restaurants more than I do.
283000	285000	She's like, I don't want to go out today. It's too crowded.
285000	287000	So we're going tomorrow.
287000	291000	And you know where my mom likes to go? You know what her favorite restaurant is?
291000	294000	This is so bad. You know what my mom's favorite restaurant is where she likes to go?
294000	295000	What?
295000	296000	Chevy's.
296000	297000	You know what?
297000	298000	Didn't I tell you about that last week?
298000	303000	Don't knock on Chevy's because they have actually a really super good salad.
303000	305000	All right.
305000	309000	Coming up later on the show in just a little while, we're going to be talking to Joe.
309000	317000	He is the creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone, which is a documentary all about The Legend of Zelda and Zelda fandom.
317000	321000	And you can check out more about that on Kickstarter or we've linked it on Twitter and so forth.
321000	325000	And we'll link it when we post the show on on Vogue and OrangeOnTwitter.com and all that, of course.
325000	328000	We'll be talking to him just a little later, about 15 minutes.
328000	332000	So to make time for the interview, I don't have a kickoff off topic tonight.
332000	334000	So we're going to get right into how was your gaming week?
334000	336000	So, Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?
336000	337000	How was your gaming week?
337000	342000	Well, I've been trying to keep myself super distracted just because of all the stuff going on in my family.
342000	345000	I've been playing Tomb Raider.
345000	351000	I started Saints for the third and then promptly turned it off because I forgot that I had left it running while I went to bed
351000	355000	because I kind of passed out from four glasses of Umeshu.
355000	360000	I've been doing a lot of drinking this week. I don't know if you noticed. My poor liver.
360000	368000	I started playing Ragnarok Online 2 now that they finally got the shit working and it's so cute.
368000	374000	And there's like pourings and flips and they're cute and you can smack the shit out of them.
374000	378000	You start off the game smacking the shit out of pourings. That's the best way to start a game.
378000	381000	And those little bastards thankfully don't steal your shit anymore.
381000	383000	That's good fan service too.
383000	388000	Yeah. Oh, no, all the same animals, all the same creatures and everything are there.
388000	393000	You remember me taking you on the vocal hunt in the old days on the old Ragnarok?
393000	395000	The stupid grasshopper with the guitar?
395000	402000	You actually get to fight Vocal. You get to find all the same little rare spawns all over the place except now they're kind of like mini bosses.
403000	414000	And some of the job classes have been turned into like the blacksmith profession is actually now a job instead of a fighter class.
414000	417000	So that's kind of what they did in 14 a little bit.
417000	425000	Yeah. But I've been having a good time with it and I think I'm definitely going to quit well just because I have not been having a good time in Oh My God Pandas.
425000	436000	And that and think about how much space I'll get off my hard drive and maybe Diablo as well now that I can keep Diablo for free because I've done my servitude to the Activision gods.
436000	438000	You've held up your end of the blood pact.
438000	440000	Yes. Now my blood is mine.
441000	451000	I have also been playing a game called Off which I am now to the first like world after whatever area zero is.
451000	458000	And it's weird and I like it except I wish I could play it windowed but I kind of understand why you can't because of how the game is programmed.
458000	464000	So it's very weird and I suggest that everybody in the universe play it because it's fucking weird.
464000	473000	And I'm going to go ahead and count this in my gaming week is I've been kept I've been rereading like all of Homestuck.
473000	486000	And so I've been actually playing through all the little mini flash games and everything to the point that I'm thinking about reteaching myself flash to do a few little mini games for bog.
486000	488000	Yeah just fun stuff.
488000	489000	Why not?
489000	498000	Practice. I am also, did I say Tomb Raider? Yeah I was playing Tomb Raider or Lara Croft's Really Shitty Day or what did Alan call it? Girl.
498000	499000	Yeah girl.
499000	500000	Girl.
500000	501000	The game. Girl.
501000	509000	And I'm also playing Mass Effect 3 again because I'm live streaming it so that I can completely make fun of the game live on air.
509000	514000	And I have adjusted my time slot so that I do not overlap Loki's streaming.
515000	517000	Or anything else on VOG of course.
517000	523000	Yeah screw all them. No I'm kidding. No I have been. Oh did you change your picture to Clue?
523000	525000	Yes. Don't talk about what I'm doing on the computer over here.
525000	527000	Sorry I like Clue.
527000	528000	Terrible radio.
528000	529000	I like Clue.
529000	530000	Yeah no I do too.
530000	535000	We need to do like an online tabletop RP Clue.
535000	537000	RP Clue?
537000	539000	Yeah if it was like a VOG thing that would be hilarious.
539000	548000	Well I've been working hard on the shadow casting here in Sacramento so if you happen to be local July 27th I'm playing Colonel Mustard in Clue. It'll be fun. It's gonna be fun.
548000	549000	Please there are ladies present.
549000	553000	Alright Loki tell us about your gaming week.
553000	566000	This week I played, what did I play this week? Well I know I played Forza because we did the VOG gaming night and stuff and we've been averaging one extra person each week.
566000	575000	So next week yeah that'll be awesome. Next week is gonna be Grand Theft Auto 4 on the free room because that was Bobby's suggestion.
575000	578000	I wasn't gonna do it because you know I mean I love Grand Theft Auto.
578000	581000	I actually have Grand Theft Auto 4 and I would have no idea what I'm doing so that might be a lot of fun.
581000	582000	On 360?
582000	588000	Do I or do I have it on PS3? Isn't that sad? I don't even know. I think I have it on 360.
589000	591000	You should have it on 360. It's awesome.
591000	599000	But and in hindsight I was actually gonna loan you a copy if you didn't have it but I forgot to bring one so oh well.
599000	608000	So yeah we're gonna be doing that and then yeah so you'll be joining in that'll be fun. We'll just be messing around driving around.
608000	611000	You wanna know what's hilarious about that? It's still in the shrink wrap.
611000	613000	That sounds like games at my house Rob.
613000	615000	That is a crime.
616000	621000	You know what's funny? Alan has been like really into Grand Theft Auto 4 lately but he's been playing it all on PC.
621000	622000	I know.
622000	631000	And just the other day I turned around to ask him a question and I just saw some stripper like fully ass nude on his computer you know titties and hoo-ha and all that.
631000	636000	And I was like what are you playing? How dare you?
636000	638000	Vagirator.
639000	649000	So yes that'll be fun. I finished also Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 the campaign and that so that was okay.
649000	652000	And what else?
655000	658000	I know I played some PC games this week.
658000	666000	Well I played one PC game but you know I could say what it is but I can't tell you anything about it other than what it was.
666000	668000	Stay tuned to vognetwork.com.
668000	673000	Yeah it's a game that's coming out next week so you'll have to see what my opinion was.
673000	674000	That's right.
674000	675000	Tomorrow.
675000	676000	So yeah I guess that was it.
676000	677000	That's it?
677000	680000	My game of the week. A lot of the same old stuff.
680000	685000	World of Warcraft obviously because unlike Dark Sakura I still play an awful lot.
685000	689000	Although I've kind of learned how to have fun by myself in a while because a lot of my friends are quitting left and right.
689000	695000	But we still have the Horde House Guild which is nice because I still see some people on there occasionally so I can at least be a little social.
695000	700000	And I even ran random dungeons with some people last night that I didn't even know I just knew through the show guild.
700000	702000	But I had fun.
702000	706000	But I've been playing a lot more PvP which is kind of how I've been entertaining myself.
706000	710000	And I know a lot of people are like oh my god I'm so scared of PvP because people are mean and so on.
710000	715000	But I've just been having fun with it and when people are mean right click ignore and I never have to see their ass again.
715000	716000	It's awesome.
717000	720000	But I've also been playing some console games.
720000	724000	One of the new games I've been playing lately, we got an email the other week.
724000	732000	I think it was last week or the week before that said Rob do you ever actually play the games that you get for free on PlayStation Plus and why aren't you talking about them on the show?
732000	738000	Well I did that this week. I actually got one of the free games on PlayStation Plus called Labyrinth Legends.
738000	741000	And I think this game came out last year but it's free on PlayStation Plus now.
741000	744000	It's a download game on PlayStation Network.
744000	748000	Best way I could describe it is it's a roguelike game if you know what that is.
748000	757000	It's like a dungeon crawler and roguelike is because it's like this old old old game back on terminal computers called Rogue which was a lot of fun when I was younger.
757000	762000	But it's like that. You're kind of crawling around a dungeon and it's a lot of puzzle solving.
762000	768000	You know there will be doors and keys and levers that open things and so forth and monsters you have to kill.
768000	771000	But maybe they keep spawning unless you do this one thing.
772000	778000	For example you have to move blocks around in a certain pattern to open a door but the room is filled with gas.
778000	785000	So in order to be in there to move the blocks in enough time you have to go kill this guy to get a gas mask.
785000	790000	And then you only get like 30 seconds to do it otherwise you have to go back and get another gas mask.
790000	798000	So it's kind of one of those things where a lot of it is muscle memory and it will take you forever to get through the labyrinth the first time.
798000	806000	But then once you kind of figure it out it's like you can speed run it and then you might get your little bonus for getting the time trial unlock.
806000	813000	And like each dungeon has five stars and they're very well hidden so sometimes there's like hidden walls and breakaway walls.
813000	821000	So you know a fun little time waster. It's not a very long game from what I understand.
821000	824000	Especially if what I see on the main screen is the only dungeons there is.
824000	827000	I don't know if they had planned to expand this through DLC or what have you.
827000	832000	But for the price of free being a PlayStation Plus subscriber I really can't complain.
832000	834000	It was a fun little waste of time.
834000	837000	So that was one of the other games I've been playing this week.
837000	840000	Other than that I can't really think of a lot.
840000	844000	Virtual console stuff on Wii U has been my other little obsession.
844000	852000	Playing Mega Man, Mario World, Kirby, looking forward because I hear Super Mario 2 is out next week so I'll give you an excuse to play that again.
852000	856000	And you know what else is out next week? Big deal. Big deal guys.
856000	860000	Super Metroid. Yes.
860000	861000	Don't you already have Super Metroid?
861000	865000	I have Super Metroid on an actual cartridge for that Super Nintendo sitting right over there.
865000	871000	But I will play it again on the Wii U because it's an amazing excuse to play through it again.
871000	881000	And plus it'll be slightly different coming through the speakers on the little gamepad and TV.
881000	886000	And I'm all about playing Super Metroid in as many different ways as I possibly can.
886000	889000	So there you go. That was pretty much my gaming week.
889000	894000	So a little bit of housekeeping before we get into tonight's news and our interview coming up in just a few more minutes.
894000	898000	I want to say of course if you're not following us on Twitter you really ought to be.
898000	900000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
900000	904000	And we're also on Facebook as well where you can get the Fugu Question of the Week there and Google Plus.
904000	907000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio all one word.
907000	913000	Or you can follow us on Google. Google Plus. Just search for OrangeLoungeRadio.
913000	919000	YYR in chat at live.vognetwork.com says isn't Super Metroid going to be 30 cents?
919000	925000	Correct. Yes it is only going to be 30 cents and YYR follows that up with then everyone should be buying it.
925000	930000	Correct. If you actually own a Wii U and you have a way to pay for things online.
930000	932000	I realize not everybody has a credit card.
932000	936000	But you seriously should go to Target and get the $5 card just so you can buy this game.
936000	940000	And if you get it quickly you can get Kirby for 30 cents still too. Just saying.
940000	944000	Koopa Kid Jeremy in chat room from Koopa Club. Howdy.
944000	948000	Says Super Metroid should be purchased in every form. Agree.
948000	952000	See? Jeremy knows what's up. He understands.
952000	955000	Super Metroid greater than everything else.
955000	959000	Alright let's get into some news. Let's do at least one of our news items real quick. Loki.
959000	962000	Except for Super Super Metroid.
962000	964000	That'd be funny.
964000	967000	Well and I never got into Metroid Prime as much as I did the 2D new Metroids.
967000	970000	What if they did a Super Metroid 2?
970000	971000	Well I mean-
971000	972000	Hey I understand the 3-
972000	975000	Zero Mission and Fusion kinda.
975000	977000	That's more of a remake sort of.
977000	985000	If they did something in the Super Metroid universe on the 3DS akin to what they're doing with Zelda.
985000	987000	I'd have a nerd boner. I would.
987000	990000	How could you not?
990000	996000	I love the 2D Metroids. The 3D ones aren't bad. I really enjoy the third game in the 3D series.
996000	999000	For some reason. I know a lot of people hated that one.
999000	1003000	And I even like the DS Prime Hunters thing. That was a cool little concept.
1003000	1008000	It's not the same. Like when you get all Doom up in here with my Metroid.
1008000	1014000	Like it's not the same. It's not bad. But I'm not as like fanboy as I am over something like Super Metroid.
1014000	1016000	Anyway. News.
1016000	1023000	Anyways. So Sony's definitely trying to get more indie games on their services.
1023000	1028000	And one way they're planning on doing that is actually waiving the license fee for PlayStation Mobile.
1028000	1031000	Now PlayStation Mobile's on pretty much everything.
1031000	1034000	PlayStation including Vita and PSP.
1034000	1038000	As well as PlayStation Mobile approved phones.
1038000	1041000	You know. Whatever that might be.
1042000	1046000	Originally they were paying $99. Now it's free.
1046000	1051000	And they're trying to get I guess the barrier of entry even lower than it was.
1051000	1054000	Which I think $99 isn't that bad.
1054000	1057000	It's kind of like what it was with XNA.
1057000	1063000	On top of that they are adding an indie game section to the PlayStation Network.
1063000	1068000	And you can actually find this. It should be available now.
1068000	1071000	And they are featuring all sorts of games.
1071000	1078000	Some of the bigger named indie titles like Retro City Rampage, Papayo, and Dyad.
1078000	1080000	That kind of stuff.
1080000	1086000	But definitely a step in the opposite direction than Microsoft is taking.
1086000	1089000	Do you think that this could be in response?
1089000	1095000	Like this is a place where maybe they see that Microsoft is vulnerable right now having done what they did with XNA.
1095000	1100000	Where Sony's like hmm maybe we should just kind of pluck that idea and implement it.
1100000	1105000	Well I think that they see a lot of popularity with the indie scene kind of rising up again.
1105000	1108000	With Kickstarter projects and just indie games in general.
1108000	1110000	Steam Greenlight and that kind of stuff.
1110000	1118000	And so if it's easy for people to bring that content that may be on PC right now to the PlayStation Network.
1118000	1120000	Then they're all for it.
1120000	1125000	That's more eyes on the PlayStation Network and more reason to buy a console that plays those games.
1125000	1131000	I'm sure Retro City Rampage, a pretty good example, Hotline Miami.
1131000	1136000	I think that's coming or already out for the Vita and PlayStation 3.
1136000	1138000	Lots of games like that.
1138000	1142000	So yeah it's definitely good.
1142000	1144000	Promote more people to come to your platform.
1144000	1147000	Definitely better than go away.
1147000	1152000	YYR in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
1152000	1157000	Personally I think the removal of the $99 fee is just because they want to increase the number of titles available.
1157000	1164000	Well certainly. Anything to add value to the Vita I think is going to be something Sony's going to want to explore.
1164000	1166000	For real.
1166000	1171000	YYR also follows that up with,
1171000	1177000	Microsoft is actually paying $100 to anyone who submits a Windows 8 app through the end of June.
1177000	1180000	Yeah but that's Windows 8. No one wants to submit a Windows 8 app.
1180000	1184000	Going back a story a minute here because this is something we neglected to mention during Metroid talk.
1184000	1186000	But Tigerclaw in chat says,
1186000	1189000	Metroid Other M was more of a direct sequel to Super Metroid.
1189000	1192000	I forgot about that. I think a lot of people do because it wasn't developed by Nintendo.
1192000	1195000	It was that whole Team Ninja third party experiment thing.
1195000	1198000	I didn't hate Metroid Other M as much as some people did.
1198000	1200000	But obviously I didn't remember it either.
1200000	1204000	So I think that kind of tells you where Other M is.
1207000	1210000	And Metroid Other M kind of sounds like, you know.
1210000	1212000	It was a weird title too.
1212000	1215000	Coca Cola classic. You know it's the UnCola.
1215000	1217000	I guess that would be 7-Up.
1217000	1221000	Titles are so important and I think a lot of times people kind of forget that.
1221000	1226000	I mean I get that they want to get a title that really conveys the message of the story of the game or whatever.
1226000	1230000	And I get it but there's so many more people that would have just been like,
1230000	1233000	Oh Super Metroid 2? Other M? Heck yeah!
1233000	1238000	You know I think that carries a lot of weight that sometimes people forget about.
1238000	1239000	Anyway.
1239000	1242000	What else do I want to ask on the indies? Going back to the indies for a minute.
1242000	1245000	Do you think this is going to be embraced by the indie community?
1245000	1248000	Not so much Sony but do you see that people would be like,
1248000	1250000	Yeah I'm going to develop for the Vita.
1251000	1254000	I don't know how easy it is to develop for the Vita.
1254000	1258000	But I know a lot of those Kickstarter projects you see.
1258000	1260000	You always see Wii U as actually a platform.
1260000	1264000	As okay my indie title is going up on Wii U which is kind of interesting.
1266000	1268000	I mean it couldn't hurt.
1268000	1276000	I think if they are struggling with financing then definitely removing that fee would help.
1277000	1280000	Hopefully get more games on there.
1280000	1283000	Hopefully that doesn't mean that's going to dilute the games that are on there.
1283000	1287000	Like with a lot of garbage indie games and stuff.
1288000	1290000	Sorry about the little ding dong by the way.
1290000	1293000	My Facebook thing decided to go off.
1293000	1296000	Which I hate that stupid beep beep on Facebook.
1296000	1297000	You can't turn it off.
1297000	1301000	You heard what you're going to be able to expect coming soon.
1301000	1303000	Auto playing video ads.
1304000	1306000	I'm just ready to leave Facebook forever.
1306000	1307000	Can't wait.
1313000	1314000	Hi dead air.
1314000	1318000	I just completely am really.
1318000	1322000	I've turned off every type of notification I possibly can for Facebook.
1322000	1325000	And now they've actually started being able to bypass my ad block.
1325000	1328000	Rama and Chet says you can disable it.
1328000	1329000	Well I need to do my more research.
1329000	1333000	But I'll have to do that later because it is time to bring on to the show Joe.
1333000	1337000	And Joe is a creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone.
1337000	1339000	It's a movie that is a Zelda documentary.
1339000	1344000	And we're going to try to get him on the line right now to talk about this Kickstarter project.
1344000	1349000	And the movie which has a trailer which you can watch if you go over to the Kickstarter page.
1349000	1351000	And search for It's Dangerous to Go Alone.
1351000	1355000	Or if you just search for Zelda movie you'll probably find it and you can see the trailer.
1355000	1357000	And check out what this project is all about.
1357000	1359000	But I believe Joe is with us right now.
1359000	1360000	Joe you there?
1360000	1361000	What's up man?
1361000	1362000	Hey how you doing Joe?
1362000	1363000	I am excellent.
1363000	1367000	Just enjoyed a beautiful day at the beach in sunny Sarasota Florida.
1367000	1370000	I really appreciate you taking the time out to come on our show.
1370000	1372000	I know it's Mother's Day and all that.
1372000	1376000	Yeah actually we were planning to be on location in the Everglades believe it or not today.
1376000	1380000	But we had to cancel the shoot because it was Mother's Day and postponed.
1380000	1383000	Well you know we're out in California.
1383000	1386000	So I associate everything Florida with Disney World.
1386000	1391000	And four of my closest friends are all at Disney World right now.
1391000	1392000	But not me.
1392000	1393000	That's hilarious.
1393000	1394000	Not me I know.
1394000	1395000	Alright we're not here to talk about Disney.
1395000	1397000	We are here to talk about Zelda.
1397000	1398000	Yes sir.
1398000	1400000	Yeah tell us a little bit about your project Joe.
1400000	1407000	Well it's a couple years ago I was actually playing with my production partner up in Baltimore when I was living up there.
1407000	1411000	We were playing through Zelda 2 because we'd never beat it as kids.
1412000	1418000	And we just went on a mission and bought a bunch of alcohol and played through Zelda 2.
1418000	1425000	And started conceiving of a documentary project that we could do about the ubiquity and cultural influence of The Legend of Zelda.
1425000	1431000	And we had a lot of artistic friends who were either filmmakers or musicians or artists or writers or whatever.
1431000	1440000	We all grew up together playing those games and it was sort of our first opening of our imaginations was through the world of Hyrule.
1440000	1446000	And so it kind of planted a seed of an idea of hey that would make for a cool documentary someday.
1446000	1449000	And all of our other projects are wrapped up or whatever.
1449000	1454000	And a couple years later I found myself in a perfect time to film that exact movie.
1454000	1461000	And started putting the feelers out and we started doing some research, started doing some legal work.
1461000	1469000	And found just a trove of awesome people that are legitimate artists and filmmakers and out in Hollywood.
1469000	1476000	And illustrators for Google and best selling authors and all these people that wanted to be involved and that were hugely inspired by the franchise.
1476000	1479000	And we said yes this is a really cool project that we want to do.
1479000	1484000	So that's how it started and it's been very cool getting it up and running.
1484000	1492000	So hearing you talk about that and watching the trailer would you say that this movie is less about necessarily Zelda and Link and the characters than the story.
1492000	1495000	But it's much more about the fans and the culture?
1495000	1501000	Yeah I'm not going to say it's void of talking about Zelda of course.
1502000	1511000	But it's definitely more about not the fandom necessarily but how it has impacted us in a cultural way.
1511000	1516000	It's such a profound way that it's hard to even estimate.
1516000	1522000	For instance as kids we're all playing this child's video game and our parents definitely don't get it.
1522000	1525000	We're six, seven years old. We're playing this Nintendo game.
1526000	1532000	And at that time me and my best friend we'd play through these worlds and all the way up through A Link to the Past.
1532000	1534000	We were really passionate about it. We were really into it.
1534000	1541000	And that best friend that I had growing up with that game, he now works for the military doing cyber security.
1541000	1546000	Like protecting our government accounts against the Chinese and all that stuff that you're hearing in the news now.
1546000	1550000	That's his job and his first foray into technology was Nintendo games.
1550000	1552000	That was his first passion for it.
1552000	1559000	So it's really interesting to see where all these Zelda fans, that was their first big experience with art or technology or fantasy.
1559000	1562000	Where they've ended up and all the cool things that they're doing now.
1562000	1567000	And they kind of owe a lot of their art or love for fantasy to that franchise.
1567000	1572000	So what notes do I play on the ocarina to unlock those big bank accounts? That's what I want to know.
1572000	1576000	That is an excellent, excellent question. I'll tell you what, that will definitely help fund.
1576000	1580000	If you find out, let me know. The film will do a little bit better.
1580000	1584000	Well, you know, I gotta say, my memories of Zelda myself.
1584000	1591000	Zelda, and specifically that game, was how I got to become more popular in elementary school.
1591000	1598000	You were that guy too. People would come to you and ask you, where is that thing? And you would know.
1598000	1602000	Yes, because I wasn't good at sports or any of that, so I got picked on all the time.
1602000	1608000	But around the fourth grade or so, when Zelda first came out, it was like, Rob, I know you do nothing but play video games.
1608000	1614000	How do I find the fourth dungeon in the second quest? Whatever it is, it's awesome.
1614000	1621000	The first girl I ever had a crush on, the first phone call I ever got from a girl that I had a crush on was about Zelda 2.
1621000	1623000	She had questions about Zelda 2.
1623000	1625000	That's awesome.
1625000	1628000	So I feel you, man. I'm right there with you.
1628000	1632000	And this is exactly the thing. Here you are doing a podcast on gaming.
1632000	1638000	And really, if it wasn't for games like that, you might not be doing what you're doing.
1638000	1640000	Absolutely.
1640000	1643000	It's fascinating to look at that and where people have come.
1643000	1648000	So why did you turn to Kickstarter? You're asking for $50,000 to fund the project.
1648000	1654000	So what is the $50,000 for and ultimately why should we consider backing it?
1654000	1656000	Ah, because it's awesome.
1656000	1664000	Well, first of all, we're competing with, say, the My Little Pony documentary, which got funded for $322,000.
1664000	1673000	For those people who aren't filmmakers or don't know, for those of you who are filmmakers, you probably know that $50,000 is a very, very small budget.
1673000	1675000	That's a micro-budget production.
1675000	1684000	For those of you who aren't into film or have never really worked on a film, first of all, a lot of that money for this project especially is going to go towards legal.
1684000	1694000	We've already been working with a legal team because we want to stay on the right side of fair use since this is somebody else's intellectual property that we're sort of focusing on.
1694000	1700000	And so far, so good. I mean, this project, everything that we're doing stays on that side of it.
1700000	1706000	But still, we need to dot our lowercase j's and make sure that everything's kosher.
1706000	1710000	So legal is going to be a big chunk of that. But another big chunk is the travel expenditures.
1710000	1721000	This isn't just a documentary where we're gathering a bunch of YouTube videos and we've got a podcast mic and we're talking over them and explaining the history of the series through gameplay videos or something.
1721000	1738000	We're actually really trying to get some unique one-on-one personal stories with people like Howard Phillips, who started Nintendo Power, and the guys from Rainfall that did that awesome April Fool's Day trailer for The Legend of Zelda for IGN a couple years ago.
1738000	1739000	Which was awesome.
1739000	1746000	Yeah, yeah. And these are all people that we've talked to that either we've already got interviews with or they're lined up.
1746000	1753000	We're going to have way more footage than we're going to be able to fit inside of our 90-100 minute documentary.
1753000	1767000	But we want to travel to these places and sit down with these people and see what they're doing now with their lives and find out how exactly Zelda has inspired them and how they've maintained with the series as they've grown up and become adults.
1767000	1771000	Their children are now playing the games and see their impressions of it.
1771000	1776000	So because of that, we're going to be traveling a lot and a lot of the money is for travel.
1776000	1778000	A lot of it is also for the distribution.
1778000	1781000	Once the film is complete, how do you get it out there?
1781000	1785000	We could just put it up on YouTube, but that's not the kind of film that we're creating.
1785000	1787000	You want something on the big screen.
1787000	1790000	The physical media, digital distribution channels, things like that.
1790000	1793000	So that's where really the money is going to be going.
1793000	1797000	And like I said, $5 million is a low-budget film.
1797000	1801000	$50,000, that's a micro-budget documentary film.
1801000	1807000	And the reason I think we turned to Kickstarter, we really wanted to do a crowdfunding.
1807000	1816000	We've actually got a couple of decent offers as far as people who want to back this project in more traditional terms like investment-wise or producer-wise.
1816000	1820000	And that will be awesome and if the Kickstarter doesn't work out, we'll pursue those.
1820000	1827000	But we love the idea of Kickstarter and this being a project where we're not trying to appease investors.
1827000	1830000	This is a project for the community.
1830000	1833000	This is a project that belongs to the community.
1833000	1835000	Everyone has a little piece of it.
1835000	1836000	Okay, awesome.
1836000	1841000	Well, speaking of community, we have our live listeners assembled in the live chat room live.vognetwork.com
1841000	1843000	if you're listening live on this Sunday night.
1843000	1849000	And if you have a question for Joe about this project, It's Dangerous to Go Alone, the movie, send us a question.
1849000	1852000	And we'll possibly read it and ask it of Joe.
1852000	1855000	Well, lately it's just been a debate over what the best Zelda game is.
1855000	1857000	Is that what's going on in the chat right now?
1857000	1858000	I side with the Link to the Past people.
1858000	1860000	Me too, but I know there's a lot of ocarina.
1860000	1861000	Well, you know what's funny about that?
1861000	1865000	I'm of the same school and just out of curiosity, how old are you guys?
1865000	1866000	37.
1866000	1867000	34.
1867000	1871000	Okay, I'll be 33 in a couple of days.
1871000	1875000	So we're all kind of in that age where we grew up with all the Zelda games, you know?
1875000	1880000	And I'm curious about the young people who started with 3D Zelda games.
1880000	1884000	If they go back and play Link to the Past, do they have that same experience?
1884000	1889000	But the one thing that makes me think that maybe they do, and we're examining this in the documentary too, by the way, a little bit.
1889000	1897000	There's as much excitement and anticipation for the sequel to Link to the Past as there is for the Wii U Zelda.
1897000	1898000	Yes.
1898000	1909000	I think that's really telling as far as how compelling that game was and how the 3D element is awesome and the visual element is great, but that doesn't make the game necessarily.
1909000	1912000	You know, a good story makes a good game.
1912000	1913000	Exactly.
1913000	1915000	Especially in that series.
1915000	1929000	And I think, though, that there has to be elements of gameplay that, you know, are just the right level of frustrating versus rewarding for your frustration to make it feel like it gives it replay value.
1929000	1935000	That's why, I hate to say it, Zelda 2 for me, I learned how to be a potty mouth with that game.
1935000	1940000	I tell you what, we relearned a couple years ago when we played it through again.
1940000	1942000	We were cursing like 10-year-olds. It was awesome.
1942000	1949000	You should hear me and my husband whenever that game gets broken out at my house. It's just like, ah!
1949000	1958000	But honestly, I think that Link to the Past took the formula from the first game that everyone seems to like so much better and really perfected it.
1958000	1961000	And if they can keep that going with the sequel, then I think the sequel is going to be successful.
1961000	1967000	And then you might see a bigger console release following suit and, man, that would be awesome.
1967000	1977000	With the capabilities you'd have for a Wii U title, to be gameplay-wise more like Link to the Past, I would be really curious to see where they could go with that.
1977000	1984000	I think Bobby Blackwolf, who's always on before us here at VOG Network, he has a good comparison that probably applies here, too.
1984000	1989000	Because he always talks about Final Fantasy and that your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that was out when you were 13.
1989000	1993000	So, probably with Zelda, a lot of that's true, too.
1993000	1997000	Yeah, your first experience in that universe, definitely.
1997000	2003000	And it is something that we're examining. Actually, there's a writer, and I'm not going to talk too much about it.
2003000	2006000	And right now, you have to just wait for the movie.
2006000	2017000	But if we include his segment, he talks a little bit about the difference between cinematic storytelling in games and video games themselves and almost creates two different mediums.
2017000	2025000	And he talks about how console games currently, they're more like cinematic experiences rather than true game experiences.
2025000	2028000	And there's a really strong divide between the two.
2028000	2034000	And the more recent console games for Zelda and stuff and for everything have gone more towards that cinematic experience.
2034000	2041000	But a game like the sequel to Link to the Past will be back to the center is not the story. The center is the gameplay mechanics.
2041000	2049000	And the story is almost incidental. They still want it to be very strong, but that's not the focus. The focus is the game itself.
2049000	2052000	And it's a really interesting thing to think about.
2052000	2057000	Well, let me ask you this question since I did bring up another franchise a minute ago that has a lot of fan passion, too.
2057000	2058000	Final Fantasy, absolutely.
2058000	2065000	Well, why did you go with Zelda? Why not Final Fantasy, Mario, Samus? Why not another character that we remember when we were young?
2065000	2067000	Why did you go for Link and Zelda?
2067000	2074000	I think we're going to talk, it's not just going to be about Zelda. There's also a lot that talks about just 8-bit gaming and why that survived in general.
2074000	2080000	And why that, there hasn't been a crash since the 8-bit era. The gaming industry has grown and grown and grown since then.
2080000	2086000	That was the seed that planted it, it became what it is today because of the NES era games.
2086000	2090000	And so it's not just necessarily about Zelda, but that's the core of it, Zelda.
2090000	2098000	And why Zelda over the other franchises? We just found that it was absolutely ubiquitous, just everywhere.
2098000	2103000	And, I mean, Final Fantasy, you could probably find the same thing for somebody who's in love with Final Fantasy.
2103000	2109000	Myself, I just, again, finally played through all of Final Fantasy VI and beat it a month ago.
2109000	2112000	I played it three times. The first time when I was a kid I never beat it.
2112000	2116000	The second time I was in college and I was using an emulator and that computer crashed.
2116000	2121000	Finally I beat it, you know? So I'm a big Final Fantasy lover, too.
2121000	2126000	But there's something about The Legend of Zelda that separates it.
2126000	2131000	And I wish, part of the purpose of this documentary is investigating that exact question.
2131000	2138000	That game, I feel like gaming wouldn't exist in its current form had it not been for the original Legend of Zelda.
2138000	2145000	It might never have grown into what it is without those early franchise games, and I think that was one of the core ones.
2145000	2152000	You know, we all, at 5, 6, 7, to 10 years old, we all felt this connection to that reality for some reason.
2152000	2158000	True. Let me follow that up with a comment in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com from mm2k who says,
2158000	2163000	I think you had to be around at that time to fully appreciate the impact of the original 8-bit franchises.
2163000	2168000	I love docs like these because they truly underscore the impact these titles had on the gaming culture.
2168000	2172000	Newer gamers should see when gameplay trumped cinematics and cutscenes.
2172000	2174000	Dark Soccer, you had another question for Joe?
2174000	2180000	I did, actually. Have you also been exploring, since you're looking at the genre of that type of game as well,
2180000	2189000	are you also looking at some of the, for lack of a better description, clones on other systems, like Neutopia that came out for the TurboGrafx-16?
2189000	2191000	Even Legend of the Valkyrie was kind of the same.
2191000	2197000	Sort of. There's a point, again, there's so much footage that's going to be shot for this documentary,
2197000	2201000	we're going to have to really make some difficult decisions in the editing room.
2201000	2205000	But there was a point where we talked a little bit about Crystallis for the NES.
2205000	2212000	Not a different system, but what Zelda could have evolved into had there been another NES release.
2212000	2215000	And we talk a lot about that.
2215000	2221000	And we don't get too much into cross-platform, mostly because I guess we're all,
2221000	2226000	and you were either a Nintendo kid or you were a Sega kid when growing up.
2226000	2229000	And it sounds like you guys were both Nintendo kids, so you understand.
2229000	2232000	No, no, this one was a Sega, very much a Sega kid.
2232000	2236000	Leave the room now, you're no longer in my new talk. Sorry, you're out of the conversation.
2236000	2238000	Wait a minute, she was a Sega adult, I guess.
2238000	2242000	No, my husband grew up with a Master System and a Genesis.
2242000	2246000	I grew up with my NES, and my brother's SNES when they moved, I bought my SNES,
2246000	2251000	and then my husband said, look, Sega Saturn, and I forgot everything else existed.
2251000	2254000	And now my favorite system to this day is the TurboGrafx.
2254000	2262000	Interesting. No, it's funny, and I love it too, because it's so fun to see the people's devotion to there.
2262000	2268000	And when I was a kid, it was Nintendo. F everybody else, screw Sega, no.
2268000	2271000	I won't hear it, I won't believe you.
2271000	2275000	And the fandom, it's not just fandom, it's like your family member,
2275000	2278000	like someone's talking bad about someone in your gang.
2278000	2281000	It pained me when I jumped ship to PlayStation. It pained me.
2281000	2287000	Yeah, yeah, really. And you almost are offended when your favorite releases aren't released on your console.
2287000	2288000	Yeah.
2288000	2292000	Why? Why is Final Fantasy not on a Nintendo console anymore? What happened, you know?
2292000	2295000	And that was exactly it. Exactly it.
2295000	2299000	Oh, just look for the N64 demo, and then you'll realize why.
2299000	2304000	Let me get to some questions from chat. We have a good one here from SSJ100Matt who has a question for you.
2304000	2308000	What's Nintendo's stance on the project? Have they contacted you, or have you contacted them?
2308000	2312000	And the reason why I ask this is because I noticed with documentaries on a specific subject matter,
2312000	2317000	tend to get some type of resistance by the original creators wanting to have their own stamp on the project,
2317000	2319000	or have it told in a certain light.
2319000	2323000	Right, well, and that's a really tricky question. We have tried to reach out to Nintendo,
2323000	2328000	but there's literally a million people per day with a project that try and reach out to Nintendo.
2328000	2335000	So we do have sort of a second-degree contact with Nintendo Legal,
2335000	2337000	but we haven't really gotten any word back from them.
2337000	2343000	Fortunately for this project, our project is not about The Legend of Zelda per se.
2343000	2349000	We're not examining the particular artwork of the games or the stories of the games.
2349000	2354000	We're really examining how the public reacted to that artwork and how they responded
2354000	2359000	and how it sort of gave them their own artistic appreciation for gaming
2359000	2364000	or spawned their love for art or creativity or music or whatever.
2364000	2374000	So in that way, there's not really a lot of legal area that we have to worry about with appeasing Nintendo,
2374000	2379000	because it's not directly related to Nintendo. It's about Nintendo, this game's influence on other people.
2379000	2384000	And we've been working very close with the legal team, making sure that everything sort of falls in fair use.
2384000	2388000	And because of that, we have to make some executive decisions, which we wish we didn't.
2388000	2393000	And there's things we want to include that are kind of gray areas that we're sort of having to scrape off.
2393000	2399000	But all in all, we haven't run into any problems with Nintendo Legal yet. We're hoping that continues.
2399000	2405000	But even if there is a problem with Nintendo Legal, it would break our hearts because we hope that they support this project.
2405000	2410000	But it's not going to stop the documentary just because of the nature of the documentary.
2410000	2414000	Okay. Let me ask you this, because of course when it comes to Nintendo,
2414000	2419000	the fanboys are pretty infamous in their passion for a lot of the Nintendo stuff.
2419000	2425000	And somebody linked me a thread on a Nintendo news website where the project got some cold reception.
2425000	2431000	What would you say to people that aren't getting this or think that you're trying to profit off Nintendo's IPs?
2431000	2434000	Oh man, there's so much stuff I wish I could talk about right now,
2434000	2441000	but I am unable to talk about it until the Kickstarter campaign is complete, because of Kickstarter's legal.
2441000	2448000	I don't mind if people are criticizing the take on the documentary.
2448000	2451000	They just don't like this or think it's appropriate.
2451000	2456000	They don't like me or my voice or my style or the filmmaking,
2456000	2460000	or they thought that the motion graphic title at the end was cheesy or whatever.
2460000	2464000	I don't mind that kind of criticism. I've been doing film for a long time.
2464000	2467000	I'm used to people liking it and people hating it.
2467000	2471000	I don't like the people who think that we're profiteering off this project.
2471000	2474000	We're probably not going to see a dime from this project.
2474000	2477000	I can't really go into much detail beyond that,
2477000	2483000	but I will say that the profits beyond production costs will not be going to us.
2483000	2485000	That's all I can say about that.
2485000	2492000	As far as the people who don't like the style, there's people who want to hate things on the Internet.
2492000	2496000	They see something, they're worried that we're going to destroy their childhood.
2496000	2501000	But for every one of those people, there's probably a thousand people that have contacted me and said,
2501000	2504000	Thank you for validating my entire childhood.
2504000	2509000	My fiancé can attest to it. The first day I saw some of those negative reviews,
2509000	2512000	I'm like, Why? No, I'm trying to do something. You'll like it.
2512000	2518000	After that, enough people prompted me that, Hey, no, man, you've got to finish this.
2518000	2521000	I really want to see this. It made me feel a lot better about it.
2521000	2523000	I think people will enjoy it.
2523000	2526000	Well, there's an old saying we have here at OLR,
2526000	2530000	and it goes back to when we first got our first one-star reviews on iTunes and so forth,
2530000	2534000	when we're paying out of pocket to do this show, and it goes, Haters going to hate.
2534000	2536000	That's what they say.
2536000	2539000	At least they're not telling you to get back in the kitchen.
2539000	2544000	That's right. If you do something that is successful, and if this turns out to be successful,
2544000	2547000	there are going to be people who will just hate it just because it was successful too,
2547000	2552000	or that maybe they didn't think of it first, or that they would have done it a different way.
2552000	2555000	We'll accept that. This is going to be our story and the way that we want to tell it,
2555000	2558000	and we hope people like it. If they don't, they don't need to watch it.
2558000	2561000	They don't need to buy it. They could bash it all they want,
2561000	2564000	but I feel like there's a good amount of people that do like this idea
2564000	2567000	and want to see what we're coming up with for it.
2567000	2571000	All right. Well, let me ask you one more question on a bit more of a positive note,
2571000	2575000	and then maybe if there's one or two more from Chad, I'll try to squeeze those in too.
2575000	2579000	What do you hope, on a more positive note, when people watch this movie
2579000	2583000	and the credits roll fade to black, what feeling do you hope people walk away with
2583000	2585000	after viewing your movie?
2585000	2591000	That's a great question. I got a feeling that the vast majority of watchers
2591000	2594000	are going to be people like our age that grew up with the entire series.
2594000	2598000	Those are the people that it's really designed for, and they're going to feel validated.
2598000	2604000	They're going to understand a little bit better this undefinable connection
2604000	2607000	they have with that franchise and why that one above all the other ones.
2607000	2612000	Like you said, why not Metroid? Why not Kid Icarus? Why not even Super Mario Brothers?
2612000	2615000	Why is there such an emotive connection to The Legend of Zelda?
2615000	2618000	And I hope this helps them feel like they're in good company,
2618000	2621000	especially the people that aren't the super hardcore Zelda nerds out there
2621000	2624000	that are just kind of passive adults now.
2624000	2628000	And they're looking back like, yeah, that really did inspire my life and why.
2628000	2630000	And I'm hoping they leave with that.
2630000	2635000	Awesome. Well, speaking of inspiration, Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
2635000	2640000	I wonder if The Legend of Zelda has inspired people who work in the entertainment industry,
2640000	2644000	not in movies or television besides in gaming. Well, you work in movies.
2644000	2653000	Well, no, we've got one Hollywood writer that is very much backing the project financially
2653000	2655000	and has agreed to be in it.
2655000	2659000	So he has requested that I not talk about that too much
2659000	2662000	because he's got another Kickstarter campaign going right now,
2662000	2663000	so he doesn't want to split.
2663000	2667000	But no, we actually have some people in Hollywood that we'll be talking to in the documentary.
2667000	2670000	Like I said, the people that work at Rainfall that did that cool IGN trailer.
2670000	2671000	Oh.
2671000	2673000	So they're going to be in it.
2673000	2678000	And also some gaming companies that are more prevalent in today's market.
2678000	2682000	We actually have an artist that's a new artist at Blizzard
2682000	2687000	who's going to be chiming in about the direction of art and games and things like that.
2687000	2691000	So yeah, absolutely, we're going to be talking to some people that are currently in the entertainment industry.
2691000	2694000	One more question here from YYR in our chatroom,
2694000	2699000	and this one might be a little bit tricky, but it's fair based on Nintendo's actions in the past.
2699000	2703000	If you go forward with this and Nintendo gives you a cease and desist right before you release,
2703000	2706000	but all the money has been spent, what happens then?
2706000	2708000	Is that of concern?
2708000	2714000	Yeah, I can't say it's a 0% threat, but we've done everything to minimize that.
2714000	2721000	And like I said, the U.S. has some great fair use laws for documentary and filmmakers.
2721000	2725000	We're pretty well versed in those and having done documentaries in the past.
2725000	2733000	And we've worked with a legal team for about six months before we even considered that this was a realistic project that we wanted to attempt doing.
2733000	2738000	So we're really, really, really working hard to stay on the side of fair use.
2738000	2742000	And like I said, in some cases that means we had to scrap some of the ideas.
2742000	2749000	But even if they tried to slap a cease and desist on us, which like I said, I hope that they had in full support of the project.
2749000	2757000	But even if they tried, they really wouldn't have a lot of legal backing in the way that we're telling the story.
2757000	2767000	So we're working really hard on that. I can never say it's a 0% possibility, but we're being very, very, very careful about that.
2767000	2774000	The best that probably would be able to happen was they'd have to say that this scene and or that scene would have to be cut from the film.
2774000	2777000	And aside from that, the film would be definitely still produced.
2777000	2784000	Gotcha. Well, you know, when I think of a movie like King of Kong, which obviously everybody knows with documentary and gaming and Donkey Kong was a Nintendo game.
2784000	2786000	And that movie happened.
2786000	2793000	And that was filmed without Nintendo's consent, at least originally. I don't know if they ended up gaining it in retrospect.
2793000	2796000	Everybody trying to beat that score.
2796000	2800000	Not to mention all of the other footage of the Midway games.
2800000	2803000	Yeah, there were other things in that too.
2804000	2815000	And I encourage anybody who's interested in doing projects like this to check out the fair use laws and see how they protect documentary filmmakers and things like that.
2815000	2821000	One of the scenes that's difficult is the scenes from the Symphony of the Goddesses.
2821000	2828000	But we got full permission from the creators of Symphony of the Goddesses. We had great sit-down interviews with those guys.
2828000	2835000	We were able to film the orchestra. They told us that they have permission to extend permission up to two minutes of filming for us.
2835000	2840000	So you could film and use two minutes of their footage in the course of the documentary.
2840000	2847000	So, you know, there's things like that. Like, yeah, there's imagery shown on the big jumbotron behind the orchestra playing Zelda themes.
2847000	2851000	But they were able to grant us permission to use it. There was just that stipulation.
2851000	2862000	So again, you know, the capturing of the imagery at that point was incidental. It was commentary on the music going from 8-bit chiptunes to full-on orchestration.
2862000	2869000	And because it's commentary like that, if you really look into the fair use laws, you'll kind of see how that works a little bit better.
2869000	2878000	And anybody who's interested in doing a project like this, I encourage doing that and really studying it and getting with somebody who knows entertainment law before you try and take it on.
2878000	2885000	Well, Joe, you're very passionate about this project. I can hear it. I can tell that you're a long-time fan of gaming and so forth.
2885000	2888000	And I really wish you the best of luck with this project and getting funded.
2888000	2894000	Anything else you want to say? You want to tell the listeners one more time how to check out the project and what it's all about and consider funding?
2894000	2899000	Sure. A couple more things I'd love to talk to you about if you can give me just a couple more minutes.
2899000	2900000	You got it.
2900000	2910000	If you guys go to www.TheZeldaMovie.com, if you're on a computer as opposed to a mobile device, there's a nice little 8-bit game that is the navigation for our site.
2910000	2917000	It's kind of fun just to play through. A lot of people have. And you get to a windscreen and you get to see two extra minutes of the film.
2917000	2923000	But yeah, if you check that out, that will also lead you. There's a link there to our Kickstarter, link there to our trailer.
2923000	2932000	So www.TheZeldaMovie.com. And the only other thing I wanted to talk about that we haven't been able to show yet but we're finally able to sort of talk about.
2932000	2937000	The main way that we want to distribute this film, we're going to have more traditional channels.
2937000	2945000	We've got a company that's working on digital distribution through online sources such as iTunes and we want to distribute Blu-ray and DVD and stuff.
2945000	2960000	But the main way that I really want to distribute this is there's actually going to be a playable game which will be sort of metaphorical of the adventure through which you can sort of play through a non-linear version of the film and find different interviews and all kinds of bonus material.
2960000	2968000	And we're going to try and make that available definitely for iOS devices, probably for Android and something that's a standalone Mac and PC game as well.
2968000	2981000	And that's not going to be like the 8-bit game on the site. That's going to be a very unique digital experience inspired by the gameplay and mechanics of original Legend of Zelda games but resemble and look more of a contemporary modern video game.
2981000	2986000	So we hope that that's the way most people watch it. That's how it's intended to be watched.
2986000	2992000	Well that sounds like a cool little extra and I think I saw some rewards in the Kickstarter have to do with being a part of that game.
2992000	2996000	That game or the 8-bit game that's going to be on the site for the duration of the film, yep.
2996000	3002000	Nice, very nice. Well best of luck to you Joe in the project and thanks for sitting down with us today.
3002000	3009000	You know I hear that our pal Bobby Blackwolf here at the Voice Geeks Network who did a story on this before might be in the movie.
3009000	3020000	He was actually out of one of our first filming experiences in Atlanta and we're going back up there in June and he's been a very strong proponent of the film which I appreciate.
3020000	3030000	That's awesome you know and it's great to know that as a fellow gamer and a fellow Zelda freak that he supports the project fully and absolutely so that's awesome.
3030000	3034000	Alright well we support you too so best of luck to you Joe. Thanks for...
3034000	3036000	Now where are you guys at in California?
3036000	3038000	We are in Sacramento, California.
3038000	3041000	I love Sacramento man. When I get out there I'll make sure to look you guys up.
3041000	3044000	That is amazing that you've actually heard of Sacramento because most people are like...
3044000	3048000	I used to tour with a rock band. Sacramento was one of my favorite towns when we traveled.
3048000	3054000	We have a great support of the indie music community out here. This is where Warp 11 is from.
3054000	3062000	Hey my friend's husband went to school with the lead singer and I used to work with their old drummer's girlfriend.
3062000	3063000	Nice.
3063000	3064000	So yeah.
3064000	3069000	It's also a small town. Alright Joe you take care and thanks again for sitting down with us tonight and best of luck on your Kickstarter alright?
3069000	3070000	Thanks guys.
3070000	3071000	Alright you're welcome have a good one.
3071000	3072000	Take care.
3073000	3078000	www.TheZeldaMovie.com for more information on It's Dangerous to Go Alone.
3078000	3080000	Loki did you enjoy hearing what that guy had to say?
3080000	3089000	Yeah. The only thing I was kind of combing through the rewards. A little disappointed to see that there's not a wooden sword as a reward.
3089000	3090000	Like an actual sword.
3090000	3091000	Like an actual wooden sword.
3091000	3096000	I mean it would be that hard. You just take a couple two by fours and slap it together on me.
3097000	3104000	Alright well maybe in the future you'll hear this back and think about adding something like that.
3104000	3106000	A little hard to ship you know.
3106000	3109000	That's true that's true and some people frown on sending weapons in the mail.
3109000	3112000	Anyhow let's move on with other video gaming news tonight.
3112000	3122000	From Zelda and the great 8-bit games of yesteryear to a very modern Diablo 3 and the modern problems that come with a game like that.
3122000	3128000	You know Blizzard put out a new patch 1.08 for Diablo 3 and there was a huge bug in the game.
3128000	3136000	It increased the stack size for in-game gold in the auction house from 1 million to 10 million making gold 10 times cheaper.
3136000	3142000	And if you cancelled a gold auction you got refunded double the amount.
3142000	3144000	Oops.
3145000	3152000	So people were exploiting this left and right to generate trillions of gold.
3152000	3157000	Isn't this the whole reason why Diablo 3 clung to this always online thing.
3157000	3161000	It's not about the DRM it's about the integrity in the auction house duh duh duh.
3161000	3164000	And then they fucked it up with this bug.
3165000	3167000	So why bother with always online.
3167000	3174000	Well I guess that's maybe why the Playstation 4 and 3 ones are going to go a different route and not have to worry about that shit right.
3174000	3176000	Hmm I don't know.
3176000	3181000	Well if there is any possible silver lining to this.
3181000	3190000	Blizzard in talking about the bug said that just 415 players all of which were sanctioned actually used the exploit.
3190000	3202000	And the real money auction sales that were generated as a part of this all of the proceeds will be redirected to the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.
3202000	3210000	If you had a legitimate transaction you have nothing to worry about but if you were one of these 415 sellers that sold the excess gold guess who really got your money.
3210000	3212000	Charity.
3212000	3217000	You know I always hate that they always punish people that exploit bugs in games.
3217000	3222000	Like if you're hacking that's one thing if you're exploiting like a bug or glitch that's kind of dumb.
3222000	3224000	Yeah but you should have seen some of these people man.
3224000	3231000	I saw somebody on or at least I saw a link to a clip from Justin TV where this guy was like I'm going to walk you through how to do this duh duh duh.
3231000	3235000	And then he's like what are you going to do about it Blizzard come at me bro duh duh duh.
3235000	3237000	And then of course they came at him.
3237000	3246000	And but you know it's kind of like when I see that kind of cockiness and arrogance you're kind of like you're waiting for these guys to get the ban hammer and it's kind of hilarious.
3246000	3250000	Come on look you got to admit like a guy like that kind of.
3250000	3255000	I'm not necessarily talking about this situation I'm talking about like you know like Call of Duty for example.
3255000	3264000	They have it's stupid they consider like jumping up on certain like areas that you might not necessarily think about jumping up on a glitch.
3264000	3272000	And so they patch that out and you can actually get like banned or you know short term banned for using these glitches in game.
3272000	3276000	Like what the hell. It's a container that you can jump on.
3276000	3278000	Why should that be a banable offense.
3278000	3282000	Well it's just weird to me that somehow this really horrific bug was missed.
3282000	3284000	I mean this is huge.
3284000	3291000	I don't know it's just kind of goes to show that tying your game to online may not fix all your problems.
3291000	3300000	It's weird that you know you might have a bug like that and then sometimes you may have a bug that causes your workers not to drive their cars to work.
3300000	3306000	And said walk up a giant hill and lose their jobs because they're you know they're too far away from.
3306000	3308000	Oh I have to be the Sims.
3308000	3310000	All right moving on.
3310000	3314000	That's why you just cheat and give yourself the motherlode code and buy a teleporter.
3314000	3317000	I mean I don't do anything like that at all do I.
3317000	3320000	But the whole point of at least the older Sims game.
3320000	3323000	I'm not talking about New Sim City but all those cheat cheat cheat cheat.
3323000	3325000	Everybody cheats in those games.
3325000	3326000	That's the fun of the game.
3326000	3330000	That's why this New Sim City was very like to me because it's always online.
3330000	3331000	How am I going to cheat.
3331000	3334000	You know which I know they have their sandbox mode but it's not the same.
3334000	3343000	The fun of the Sims for me was pretty much building my house and then seeing getting all of the you know really dirty add ons that people would make.
3343000	3348000	Prince Brightstar in chat an interesting comment it's a difference between single and multiplayer games.
3348000	3354000	You know Diablo's auction house is very multiplayer but see that's where Diablo is in a weird place because a lot of people are like.
3354000	3356000	I want to play Diablo as a single player game.
3356000	3362000	This is why I hated the online thing in the first place is that it wasn't never a multiplayer thing to me.
3362000	3369000	For me I think Diablo is more fun with more people but you know I respect those that don't want to play the game that way.
3369000	3371000	Playing with other people is hell.
3372000	3373000	Awesome.
3373000	3377000	Because it reminds me of like.
3377000	3378000	What was it.
3378000	3381000	The.
3381000	3382000	Oh crap.
3382000	3384000	Now I can't remember the hell that.
3384000	3385000	The gauntlet.
3385000	3386000	Got legends.
3386000	3392000	Reminds me that it'd be cool to do like a Diablo arcade game like with four players at the same time and just.
3392000	3393000	Oh yeah.
3393000	3394000	Oh yeah.
3394000	3395000	The gauntlet legends was kind of that.
3395000	3396000	I know.
3396000	3397000	Anymore.
3397000	3398000	It was amazing.
3398000	3399000	Getting in 64.
3399000	3400000	Dust it off.
3400000	3401000	All right.
3401000	3402000	Anyhow let's move on.
3402000	3404000	I can dig one up for you.
3404000	3415000	Anyway there's a rumor going around and there was even a fake logo out on Reddit about this that the next Xbox was supposed to be called the Xbox Infinity.
3415000	3416000	Yeah.
3416000	3418000	I'm sorry.
3418000	3419000	Good.
3419000	3425000	Well this is supposed to be a report from the International Business Times.
3426000	3437000	And that there was also says to be floating around in rumor land about an Xbox TV video streaming set that was mentioned via Wall Street Journal.
3437000	3442000	But Microsoft is like we're not commenting on that because it's rumors and speculation.
3442000	3444000	And even if it's true we aren't telling you.
3444000	3454000	OK well the International Business Times thing is completely fake by the way because their source they said unnamed sources and they said read it right there is like OK.
3454000	3455000	That's not true.
3455000	3460000	And yes it came out that the person actually created the Photoshop for that said nope that's not true.
3460000	3466000	So yes unfortunately the exit will fortunately be Xbox infinity thing.
3466000	3467000	Not true.
3467000	3477000	More likely is the fact fusion which would be you know something that would tie in with all the site registrations that they have for Xbox fusion or something like that.
3477000	3480000	So some part of it still a dumb name whatever.
3480000	3482000	So yeah Xbox infinity.
3482000	3485000	That's just a ridiculous name because how do you go from there.
3485000	3493000	I mean if you have plus one at any rate basically just talking about this for the sake of squashing the rumor mill.
3493000	3496000	It's not true.
3496000	3501000	Like getting your information from Reddit would be like me writing my term paper on Wikipedia.
3501000	3502000	It could be correct but you don't know.
3502000	3503000	You don't know who these people are.
3503000	3505000	I solve crimes on Reddit.
3505000	3508000	No there's nothing wrong with getting some news from Reddit.
3508000	3512000	As long as you back as long as you can trace stuff leaks out.
3512000	3521000	It's fine if stuff leaks out but you have to have some sort of evidence that leaks a screen a picture on Reddit is not evidence.
3521000	3524000	That is like that's ridiculous.
3524000	3527000	To be fair I don't want to make it sound like we're dogging on Reddit.
3527000	3528000	I love Reddit.
3528000	3529000	I'm a user.
3529000	3537000	I you know I post on things and so forth and it's been a great place to enrich the Warcraft podcast community has a great subreddit.
3537000	3542000	But you have to because Reddit is a part of the Internet.
3542000	3544000	You have to be a little bit of a skeptic.
3544000	3545000	You have to be.
3545000	3547000	I'm not saying it's just an extension of everything else in the end.
3547000	3552000	Reddit's bad but it's just like saying you saw a screenshot on some random Web site.
3552000	3556000	If you have nothing that if you have no like sort of evidence to back that up.
3556000	3559000	You know let's say you have actual sources.
3559000	3562000	Now we know that the International Business Times has no fucking sources.
3562000	3567000	Their sources are fucking some dude that's in their IT department or some intern.
3567000	3571000	Hey I was on Reddit during a quote lunch unquote.
3571000	3576000	Or examiner.com is almost all like user based.
3576000	3578000	And Forbes is going that way too.
3578000	3581000	But here's the worst fucking part about that.
3581000	3585000	So they ran that story and they checked no sources or whatever.
3585000	3586000	Nothing.
3586000	3587000	And so they ran it.
3587000	3590000	Then everybody else ran it.
3590000	3591000	Everybody ran it.
3591000	3593000	It's like what the fuck.
3593000	3596000	First off these guys don't check their sources.
3596000	3598000	Then you just don't check your sources either.
3598000	3600000	You're just as bad as they are.
3600000	3605000	Oh there's a there's a lot of those journalists sites that they keep their tabs on.
3605000	3606000	Another response.
3606000	3609000	So you may have seen us run this article about this.
3609000	3612000	Well it was a clever photo shot.
3612000	3614000	I was like come on man.
3614000	3616000	Seriously you didn't even check anything.
3616000	3620000	I thought you had sources that had information about things.
3620000	3624000	OK back when the whole beautiful Katamari thing happened to us right.
3624000	3629000	That was all dig which you know was kind of like the Reddit of five years ago right was dig.
3629000	3636000	And you know when when our story got up voted and all that on dig because people were you know seeing it on our site.
3636000	3638000	That's when it really blew up and it was everywhere.
3638000	3643000	And then you know he got got too far exposed.
3643000	3644000	But anyway.
3644000	3657000	But I'm saying that there's it's just they're not thinking if all these sites have sources though it just makes you wonder how legit these sources are if they're taking Reddit photos.
3657000	3665000	I mean I'm not saying it's bad it's on Reddit but just like an anonymous screenshot on your website or something like that.
3665000	3667000	To be fair some of them credited it with due credit.
3667000	3683000	Like I saw a run of this story on Ars Technica that said you know here's this story about Xbox infinity and then they ran it with the logo but the caption logo was here's how one Reddit user named imagine the logo to look you know and it was it was done right.
3683000	3685000	So.
3685000	3693000	All right. Anyhow I like the name Xbox infinity but that's about as far as I give this story anyway.
3693000	3698000	Sorry we'll see me May 21st it is almost here for God's sake.
3698000	3702000	Right now one more one more show full of this crap.
3702000	3705000	You know what I don't even care.
3705000	3708000	I'm calling it the shit box.
3708000	3711000	We already let our listeners vote it's Xbox lube.
3711000	3718000	Or that or I'm gonna like build a new litter box for my cat that looks like whatever the new Xbox is so she can poop in it.
3718000	3734000	All right. What you need to do I mean it's already it's begging for a Photoshop but you know Invader Zim had these alien race with the amazing fusion technology and it's basically duct taping shit together so you know I fused this phone with a hamster.
3734000	3736000	They already did that with two game cubes.
3736000	3745000	Not duct tape. I've known people who have held computers together via duct tape and I saw a car that seemed to be held together by nothing but duct tape and chicken wire last time I was in Alabama.
3745000	3748000	I kid you not the whole door.
3748000	3760000	Prince bright star chat says name speculation has always been a part of new console launches remember the Nintendo on. I do and I remember when they were just going to call it Nintendo or revolution remember that.
3760000	3770000	Well technically it was called revolution it was their code name for that but you know just like dolphin and drango seven dolphin dolphin.
3770000	3776000	Just a commercial.
3776000	3780000	And then Tyra bank screaming and running.
3781000	3794000	You know we're talking about the midness new litter box being an Xbox lube. The thing is is that if we got one of those Dan would put it on the shelf and Midna would try to take over and sit on it because that's what she does with our current Xbox.
3794000	3803000	That's what video game systems are there cat warmers have a black shelf and a black Xbox and my black cat sits right next to the Xbox when she's trying to blend in and hide from people.
3803000	3810000	It is the funniest thing because you where's cat where's cat where's cat green eyes there's a cat knows the Xbox is just on fusing with the Xbox.
3810000	3811000	Nice. All right. Let's move on.
3811000	3832000	All right. So there's yet another rumor about a set tops box version of the next Xbox and you know it kind of goes back to the rumors where they were saying that you know there's going to be two different types of Xbox systems there's going to be one that's kind of like a Apple TV or you know something that's basically connected to the Internet always.
3832000	3843000	But it has no actual media media drives or anything like that. It's mainly meant for like streaming and you know Xbox Live arcade and that kind of sort of thing serves that.
3843000	3858000	And this is actually coming from I guess an anonymous source that told the Wall Street Journal that this Xbox TV thing is in the works and I guess we'll have to wait until the 21st to see if that's actually going to happen.
3858000	3873000	I think we've been hearing a lot of rumors about it. It would make sense if they did something like that because I mean the new focus of the system aside from playing games is going to be kind of integrating with the you know your TV watching you know they want to have their own content.
3873000	3885000	It's a big thing you know for people that don't necessarily game on the Xbox you know or if you are gaming on the Xbox the other half of your time is probably watching Netflix or Hulu or something like that.
3885000	3891000	So it would make sense that they're trying to integrate it even more.
3891000	3902000	Every Xbox though that's come out they've had this advertisement for linking your TV shows and doing you know making it a hub for all of your entertainment it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being accurate.
3903000	3912000	I don't mind the way they've got it right now but I don't like having to launch separate programs for everything. I just kind of want it as like channels almost if that makes sense.
3912000	3931000	You know just like OK I need to watch you know or kind of like how they do it I guess on the Wii U with the TV is you know OK I want to watch The Simpsons or something and then it's like OK The Simpsons are on Netflix on Hulu and on Fox right now.
3931000	3939000	Or on you know Amazon and you can pick where you want to stream that shit from instead of having to figure out OK well I got to go on Hulu.
3939000	3950000	Oh shit it's not here. Oh I got to go on Netflix. Oh it's not here. Oh I got to go here. You know it'll show you where it's at and where you can find it or if it's on TV right there or you can maybe go one step further and say OK I want DVR that.
3950000	3953000	Did they integrate Netflix into TV finally.
3953000	3955000	I think that was the first thing that they integrated.
3955000	3959000	No it wasn't there at first it was they had Amazon was in there at first.
3959000	3965000	I think was the first I know it's I think it's on there because it's that and then Amazon.
3965000	3972000	I actually used my Wii U for Netflix last night but I didn't do it through TV I just was in the Wii U.
3972000	3983000	So I'm going to our chat room at live dot vog network dot com Rama says Xbox TV just like Apple TV but cheaper and less uppity.
3983000	3985000	Hey well it might not be cheaper either.
3985000	3988000	Apple TV is pretty fun and cheap. Ninety nine bucks now.
3988000	3993000	You know what though you can just have a computer.
3993000	3996000	Yeah build a ninety nine dollar computer.
3996000	4002000	Or just get somebody's old PC that they're not using or get one at a thrift store as long as it'll go online it works.
4002000	4004000	It's just not sexy though.
4004000	4006000	Mine's pretty sexy.
4006000	4012000	Bobby Blackwell in our chat room confirming yes they did with the integration with Netflix on TV.
4012000	4016000	They've also recently integrated Hulu Plus and I'm pretty sure on that last one at least.
4016000	4026000	Yeah I just had to look it up because we're having a seminar this week about video streaming and what it means for our business.
4026000	4033000	Basically a bunch of people going to be saying oh it's so difficult don't worry don't worry you can still sell movies.
4034000	4037000	All right well moving on to back to games.
4037000	4043000	A big merger happened in the gaming world this week exceed the games who made what Pandora's Tower.
4043000	4049000	They made other a few other games to like a lot of cult like didn't they do the last story and they did the last story.
4049000	4051000	They brought all those rainfall games over.
4051000	4054000	Yeah everything except for the first one.
4054000	4056000	Oh the Xenoblade yeah.
4056000	4062000	Well Exceed purchased Atlas Online and Atlas of course did what like Disgaea.
4062000	4065000	Don't they publish that and you know they they do a lot of those publishings.
4065000	4068000	I think Atlas Online is a separate entity from.
4068000	4070000	Oh derp derp.
4070000	4072000	Well good I'm glad you clarified that but Atlas Online.
4072000	4074000	Promise of wild arms.
4074000	4082000	Atlas Online has been purchased from or has been purchased by Exceed games and they've now formed a new name.
4082000	4085000	So you're not going to hear this anymore you're going to hear Marvelous USA.
4085000	4091000	They will be based in Irvine and it's going to be all the employees from the former Exceed game teams.
4091000	4096000	And with Atlas Online I see because it's going to be about enhancing mobile and online game markets.
4096000	4102000	So it's kind of more about rounding themselves out so that probably you could see like a Pandora's Tower like iPhone game and so forth.
4102000	4104000	This has nothing to do with this guy.
4105000	4107000	They've got.
4107000	4114000	Was it killer is dead is their next big kind of multi platform release.
4114000	4116000	All right well very cool.
4116000	4126000	You know it's not like you know these are these are two kind of smaller ish companies joining together to try and step it up and compete more with the big guys like EA and so forth.
4126000	4127000	So this kind of neat.
4127000	4129000	Yeah it doesn't sound like there was job loss that came out of it.
4129000	4131000	So great.
4131000	4133000	All right let's move on.
4133000	4140000	Well in other news we have well some very interesting news coming out of for EA.
4140000	4152000	They have a FIFA exclusive license until 2022 which I guess they're not hurting all that much if they're getting the FIFA games.
4152000	4160000	That's including the FIFA World Cup game and everything under EA Sports for the FIFA branding.
4160000	4176000	Also now and this is the kicker I would say is that Disney is giving EA a Star Wars game agreement exclusive licensing for all of the Star Wars characters and storylines.
4176000	4183000	EA is going to develop and publish the new titles for a quote core gaming audience over.
4183000	4186000	See all interactive platforms and the most popular game genres.
4186000	4191000	Disney is retaining the rights to develop new titles with mobile social tablet and online gaming.
4191000	4200000	So Disney thank you for killing the Star Wars franchise by putting it in EA's hands.
4200000	4207000	You know and they're going to rush everything out and give us shitty endings and change the writing halfway through the story.
4207000	4219000	I don't think it's a bad thing actually because look at some of the look at the game to everyone wants Star Wars battlefront to publish the last three or three whatever it wants equal to two.
4219000	4226000	So look who published the last one I mean I think it was EA under you know they published it for LucasArts if I remember correctly.
4226000	4229000	So that's not so bad.
4229000	4239000	Well was it just me or when you guys read the news about this this week did you just suddenly hear this in your head.
4239000	4241000	You know what.
4241000	4243000	You might laugh.
4243000	4247000	EA owns your ass right now.
4247000	4252000	Coming to wreck all your favorite games.
4252000	4256000	Hey I look forward to Star Wars FIFA soccer.
4256000	4261000	You know what I was going to use this as my wedding march.
4261000	4264000	Had we not gone to the courthouse.
4264000	4268000	You were literally you were going to literally walk down the aisle to this.
4268000	4270000	I was.
4270000	4272000	You know what I was going to walk down the aisle to.
4272000	4278000	Tara walked down to Doctor Who stuff because she walked down to the Star Trek The Next Generation opening.
4278000	4283000	Now I know it sounds weird to hear me talking about walking down the aisle but you have to realize in a gay wedding it'll be a little bit different.
4283000	4293000	But I already have my song picked out.
4293000	4295000	You guys miss Alan in the background.
4295000	4300000	Alan just like with impeccable common timing just walked by and went nope.
4300000	4303000	That was Abba's I do I do I do just in case you didn't.
4303000	4307000	I imagine most of our audience probably didn't catch the reference but that was it.
4307000	4310000	Oh come on. It's you. They know you and your love of Abba.
4310000	4316000	I just wish that we had a webcam on when you were playing just dance Abba.
4316000	4320000	And I'm glad we didn't. That was the funniest thing I've ever seen.
4320000	4326000	I really had to walk down the aisle to the song week.
4326000	4328000	I don't remember. I remember your ass.
4328000	4332000	You should remember the D.J. that was absolutely terrible.
4333000	4335000	When you walked out.
4335000	4337000	OK. Not the aisle but when you were introduced.
4337000	4339000	Yeah yeah yeah. No no no.
4339000	4345000	When we first walked out when we walked in the aisle it was supposed to be I think it was supposed to be a sunrise sunset.
4345000	4348000	I think was supposed to be what they're going to be. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.
4348000	4351000	And then it ended up being like week or something.
4351000	4354000	I'm like the hell are you playing.
4354000	4359000	Nice that you're at say that your wedding was pretty fun.
4359000	4365000	And I will say that Chris that Chris Brown song that you have that everybody dancing to that's band.
4365000	4369000	You will not hear that. You will not hear that goddamn song at my wedding.
4369000	4372000	So all right. Anyway.
4372000	4377000	Rama in chat says Rob Roberts is going to walk down the aisle to its reigning men or something by the Spice Girls.
4377000	4382000	How gay do you think I am. No Spice Girls.
4382000	4386000	That's totally you. I mean then again I am talking about walking down to Abba but that's different.
4386000	4389000	That's classic. Abba is classic. That's right.
4389000	4394000	But Spice Girls is getting pretty classic. I'll tell you what you if you want to class it up a bit.
4394000	4397000	Get lucky. You just need to get lucky.
4397000	4400000	It's not even really walking out. It's more strutting.
4400000	4404000	I'll just I'll just I'll walk down to the music from Tron.
4404000	4408000	No no no no no. The game has changed.
4408000	4412000	You have to you have to do you have to do that.
4412000	4417000	You have to do the Wendy Carlos Tron soundtrack. Oh no no no.
4417000	4419000	And we'll have blue lights everywhere. All right.
4419000	4422000	Anyway somehow we went from Star Wars to weddings.
4422000	4425000	But all right. So Loki doesn't think this is such a big deal.
4425000	4428000	You know what. The Star Wars games lately have been so bad.
4428000	4432000	What was really what was the last time there was a good Star Wars game.
4432000	4437000	Super Star Wars. Granted the Old Republic. I didn't hate it.
4437000	4440000	I just think it was a better single player game.
4440000	4445000	And some of the MMO aspects didn't work out so well and kind of flopsied.
4445000	4448000	But like I can't stop thinking about that Star Wars connect game.
4448000	4451000	It was so bad. Okay well that was really terrible.
4451000	4457000	What about before that the force unleashed. I think some people like the first one.
4457000	4459000	That was supposed to be all right. Oh Alan's here.
4459000	4462000	Are you going to are you going to comment further on the music choices Alan.
4462000	4464000	No just Star Wars games.
4464000	4468000	Force Unleashed I thought was pretty good even if the first one wasn't quite finished.
4468000	4472000	And Jedi Academy. Jedi Academy 2. I love that game. I'd love to see a third one.
4472000	4477000	I remember Dan playing through Rogue Squadron and that seemed pretty neat.
4477000	4480000	No more no more Star Wars characters in Soul Calibur though you can bet that.
4480000	4484000	That's that's done. All right.
4484000	4486000	You know what. That was a mistake.
4486000	4489000	I liked it. Star Killer was an awesome character.
4489000	4493000	Not so much the Yoda invader that was what the Star Killer made a great character in Soul Calibur.
4493000	4495000	But anyway.
4495000	4497000	Maybe we'll get another Marvel fighting game from EA.
4497000	4500000	All right let's travel around the world. Look those Star Wars games what they're not.
4500000	4505000	They said none of them in fiscal 2014. So it's going to be a while before you see these games.
4505000	4509000	So for now let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming a little bit sooner.
4509000	4515000	This week there's only one game coming out and that would be Metro Last Light.
4515000	4518000	And that's on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC.
4520000	4525000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on bognetwork.com
4525000	4528000	use the passphrase damage.
4528000	4530000	Well that was short.
4530000	4533000	Yep. We've had a lot of weeks of just like nothing lately.
4533000	4536000	It'll pick up a little. Everyone's sleeping.
4536000	4538000	Especially with summer coming up you would think.
4538000	4540000	I wish I was sleeping right now.
4540000	4542000	I'm usually dead though.
4542000	4547000	Well they're usually like a bunch like late May early June like right when the kids get a bunch late in June.
4547000	4550000	But it's not the case this year.
4550000	4553000	Interesting traveling over to Japan and checking out what is coming out over there.
4553000	4559000	I know we've talked about this series before a love alternative total eclipse on PlayStation 3.
4559000	4562000	I know we've talked about this before. Isn't it like an anime or something.
4562000	4566000	We finally figured out is what it's about. I thought it was like a girl groping game or something.
4566000	4571000	It sounds like it sure looks like it when you see pictures like that where they don't show the guy's face.
4571000	4575000	You know it's porn. There's some love going on.
4575000	4579000	And then Mac warriors. I remember this. It's like based on an anime or something.
4579000	4582000	I think somebody had to educate us on this. That's all the animes.
4582000	4584000	You know what like scantily clad women and Macs.
4584000	4588000	That's all the games in Japan that don't come out over here.
4588000	4592000	And honestly I have no problem with that.
4592000	4594000	I mean because that's pretty awesome.
4594000	4596000	Macs are awesome. Women are awesome.
4596000	4598000	Bob Coffee in chat says it's a visual novel.
4598000	4601000	Visual novel is not so awesome.
4601000	4603000	Stop.
4603000	4607000	On the Xbox 360 also Muv Luv is there as well.
4607000	4611000	By the way that's a regular limited edition and Famitsu deluxe pack.
4612000	4614000	I'm assuming Famitsu is going to give it a 40 right.
4614000	4615000	No probably not.
4615000	4617000	Moving on to the PlayStation Vita.
4617000	4620000	Nothing this week but there will be a new blaze blue pretty soon.
4620000	4621000	Or is that a price reduction.
4621000	4623000	Oh sorry that's a price reduction.
4623000	4625000	Why can't we get any more Tokimeki.
4625000	4627000	You know good old fashioned dating sims.
4627000	4628000	You should write your congress person.
4628000	4631000	They have visual novels coming out from axis games.
4631000	4635000	It's more of the I don't remember which series it is now.
4635000	4639000	But they've done a couple on PSP and they keep putting them out on PSP.
4639000	4642000	Rama from our friends at Anime Jam Session.
4642000	4645000	Tuesdays on VoG says Loki you shut your whore mouth.
4645000	4648000	Not all anime is boobs and ass.
4648000	4650000	All the good ones though.
4650000	4651000	Hey.
4651000	4655000	Hey there's lots of good anime out there that isn't boobs and ass.
4655000	4657000	Like Pokemon. Pokemon.
4657000	4661000	I didn't say it was all boobs and ass. I said it was boobs and ass and mechs.
4661000	4666000	I was about to say Macross but yeah there's some of that there too.
4666000	4669000	Alright on the Wii U this week nothing.
4669000	4672000	But Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is soon.
4672000	4674000	That would of course be Resident Evil over here.
4674000	4679000	On the 3DS this week G1 Grand Prix gets a price reduction.
4679000	4682000	And that's really it on the 3DS this week.
4682000	4686000	Lastly taking a look at one more console here.
4686000	4689000	The PSP because there's still some things trickling through over there.
4689000	4692000	Summon Knight 5 comes out this week from Namco Bandai.
4692000	4694000	Or as they call it over there Bandai Damco.
4695000	4697000	So there you go.
4697000	4698000	That looks neat.
4698000	4699000	It looks like another little chibi.
4699000	4704000	It looks like a strategy RPG thing.
4704000	4706000	Like a tactics style game.
4706000	4708000	Never mind.
4708000	4710000	Well how about the UK?
4710000	4711000	Yes how about it?
4711000	4713000	They have crumpets. No I'm kidding.
4713000	4715000	Well yeah they do but still.
4715000	4719000	On the 14th of May we have Dust 514.
4719000	4722000	On the 15th we have Sanctum 2 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360.
4722000	4728000	On the 16th Frozen sign ups for iPad and the Starship Domre on 3DS.
4728000	4734000	And on the 17th Metro Last Delight for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC.
4734000	4736000	And that is all.
4736000	4738000	Alright just a couple more news stories for you guys.
4738000	4740000	And then the classic game of the week.
4740000	4741000	But first Loki.
4741000	4742000	Alright.
4742000	4744000	So Silicon Knights.
4744000	4750000	You may remember them for 2Human and a bunch of other games.
4750000	4751000	I remember them for 2Human.
4751000	4756000	Well they have closed their doors or closed their offices.
4756000	4762000	They have emptied out their offices and unloaded some of their properties.
4762000	4766000	In fact unloading some assets from Eternal Darkness I want to believe.
4766000	4770000	To the Shadows of the Eternal Kickstarter there.
4770000	4773000	So they've actually got assets now for their new game.
4773000	4783000	And they are still arguing with Epic Games over 2Humans still if you can believe that.
4783000	4786000	I mean how long ago? 2008?
4786000	4788000	I mean jeez.
4788000	4791000	Give it up already. You haven't won yet.
4791000	4794000	Oh 5 whole years ago. No. Yeah. 5 whole years ago.
4794000	4798000	They're still fighting them even though I remember the last thing.
4798000	4807000	I want to say the last settlement. The judgment was that they owed even more or something now.
4807000	4808000	I don't remember.
4808000	4815000	Yeah. 4.45 million going to Epic Games.
4815000	4817000	And still they're fighting it.
4817000	4821000	Gosh. I don't know.
4821000	4825000	I don't think we're going to see any more games from Silicon Knights.
4825000	4829000	Yeah. I think it's safe to say you probably are not going to see anything else from them.
4829000	4833000	But you will see some new games possibly on a new game console.
4833000	4837000	It's a mobile game TV console. It's called Game Pop.
4837000	4840000	This is being made by Bluestacks.
4840000	4845000	And you can play mobile games on your TV with this little device using the controller.
4845000	4847000	An iPhone or an Android smartphone.
4847000	4850000	But here's where it's different than say the Ouya.
4850000	4853000	Which is probably the first thing that pops into your mind which is very similar.
4853000	4855000	Something like Game Stick.
4855000	4858000	The subscription model is like Netflix here.
4858000	4863000	For $7 a month you get the entire Game Pop library.
4863000	4865000	That's 500 games right now.
4865000	4867000	Now how many of those are actually good games? Who knows?
4867000	4869000	But out of 500 there's got to be at least a few.
4869000	4873000	So it's more the... What's the streaming?
4873000	4874000	Game Tap.
4874000	4878000	Yeah. Game Tap. Or what was the other one that is the streaming stuff just a few years ago?
4878000	4879000	On Life.
4879000	4881000	Yeah. The On Life model.
4881000	4884000	So anyway. Yeah. Very interesting.
4884000	4888000	Also if you pre-order the console this month you get it for free.
4888000	4891000	As long as you are doing a paid subscription to the service.
4891000	4893000	There is no commitment or contract.
4893000	4899000	The only little catch is that you have to return the console if you cancel your service within one year.
4899000	4904000	But as long as you're willing to do what? 12 payments of $7.
4904000	4906000	You would get a year's worth of games in the console.
4906000	4910000	But again they're mobile games on your TV.
4910000	4913000	And it's something that you need to have a mobile phone to...
4913000	4918000	Or basically you have to download an app on your device to play.
4918000	4920000	No since there's a controller. Or you can use iPhone or Android.
4920000	4921000	Really?
4921000	4922000	Yeah since there's your controller.
4922000	4926000	That's what I was a little confused on because they actually in their trailer they don't actually show a controller.
4926000	4930000	They just show you have to download the app and use your phone as the controller.
4930000	4937000	In fact actually I don't think there is a controller because it basically what it does is it changes your phone into a controller.
4938000	4940000	It's almost like a second screen if you will.
4940000	4944000	But that's the only thing that seems kind of unappealing to me.
4944000	4946000	Because if you really want to do that.
4946000	4949000	And I know that you can say the same argument about the Ouya and stuff.
4949000	4955000	But you can get like an HDMI cable for your phone for like less than 30 bucks.
4955000	4958000	And plug your phone into your TV.
4958000	4961000	But there's the whole fact that you get 500 games.
4961000	4964000	Now act deft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
4964000	4967000	It says Action 52 had 52 games in it and how many of those were good?
4967000	4970000	Well but one of them was in Angry Birds.
4972000	4977000	There might be a couple gems amongst I'm sure a lot of throw away games here.
4977000	4979000	But you know there might be some good stuff.
4979000	4981000	It's an interesting idea.
4983000	4987000	Do you think we're not that far away from Xbox or Playstation?
4987000	4990000	Well hell Playstation Plus is kind of like this.
4990000	4999000	It's been saying already that the Xbox 360 or the new Xbox is going to be focusing a lot on free to play stuff.
4999000	5001000	Probably because it makes sense.
5001000	5006000	Because if it's free to play you can avoid piracy because who cares.
5006000	5010000	Pirate it, more copies are out there and you make all your money in DLC.
5010000	5012000	I don't know.
5012000	5015000	It's alright if they don't make it ridiculous.
5015000	5017000	You know what I mean?
5018000	5029000	Alright well let's take a trip back in time to a time when you know you didn't have any of this subscription fees to play a game or anything like that.
5029000	5031000	Unless you had to tell of you.
5031000	5033000	I guess but I think this game might go before that.
5033000	5034000	I don't know.
5034000	5035000	No this game is well after that.
5035000	5036000	Oh okay.
5036000	5041000	Well we're going to take a trip back in time then just a little bit to a classic video game the Dark Sakura has picked for us.
5041000	5047000	She's jumped into the vault and said hey ungrateful kids play this game this week and respect gaming.
5047000	5049000	Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week?
5049000	5052000	I picked the Neon Genesis Evangelion game for Nintendo 64.
5052000	5060000	It actually out of all of those games that's come out like the Saturn games and the other ones.
5060000	5062000	This one has to probably be my favorite.
5062000	5070000	It was really fun as far as it going through the entire series with the various battles and everything.
5070000	5079000	It was based pretty directly on the TV series and actually went into events for End of Evangelion.
5079000	5088000	So you had 13 missions that were basically focused on each of the angels going up to the...
5088000	5093000	In fact this scene that I've linked here is the mission 12 where you go against the Eva series.
5093000	5099000	And then at 13 are the other...
5099000	5101000	Yeah I went up through 13 levels.
5101000	5107000	So basically this is just a retelling of the series but it's one that you participate in.
5107000	5112000	You play as the various pilots in the game.
5112000	5119000	There's even like this one right here is probably my favorite part in the entire series where Asuka gets her big I'm going to kick everybody's ass moment.
5119000	5122000	Oh wait I'm no longer in a coma.
5122000	5127000	It was really really freaking well done for something on the Nintendo 64 I just had to say.
5127000	5133000	So really there's not that much to say about it.
5133000	5138000	It's that you basically control the weapons as they go.
5138000	5147000	You have cinematic attacks, you have actions, you have a different type of game plan that goes through.
5147000	5151000	You're sort of in a 3D, 2D course where you can walk back and forth.
5151000	5157000	But it pretty much has to do with just pressing the right commands to do the cinematic attacks.
5157000	5159000	I mean that's really the basis of it.
5159000	5164000	And then in the end you have like a free for all.
5164000	5168000	You're still in that 3D, 2D sort of movement you can move more freely.
5168000	5172000	And that's used in missions 12 through 13.
5172000	5178000	You also have parts that are outside the missions like a training mode that's called simulation.
5178000	5184000	You have different models that you can view.
5184000	5188000	You've got your story mode so you're actually playing through the events and the stories.
5188000	5195000	And really there's actually also a versus mode too where you can do two player Eva versus Eva mode.
5195000	5200000	And it's really just simple.
5200000	5204000	It's freaking Evangelion you're playing the episodes.
5205000	5208000	And this one to me was the best of them.
5208000	5216000	Just because it had more of that action element to it and less of the whole, as I was calling the Saturn ones, dates of Evangelion.
5216000	5220000	It's just good, good game.
5220000	5226000	It was the best of the lot and I think that for anyone who's a fan of the series you should definitely give it a try.
5226000	5228000	For a Nintendo 64 game it looks really good too.
5228000	5229000	It does.
5230000	5237000	If I remember correctly this is one of the games that was released during the later part of the Nintendo 64's life.
5237000	5245000	Because I remember I think that I first played this when I had a Dreamcast.
5245000	5248000	I know that one of my friends bought this and that's how I played it.
5248000	5251000	But this is on my list of things to eventually pick up.
5251000	5254000	It was a really, really fun game.
5254000	5263000	I mean really since it's Nintendo 64 I'm throwing it on the list because I really can't say enough good things about it.
5263000	5269000	It may seem kind of dated now but for its day it was pretty nice graphics and really good gameplay.
5269000	5270000	It was very solid.
5272000	5273000	That's it.
5273000	5278000	Alright there it is your Classic Eve of the Week for the Nintendo 64 Neon Genesis Evangelion.
5280000	5281000	Awesome.
5281000	5286000	Neat pick because I don't know much about that series at all but watching that YouTube I was like oh this looks kind of fun.
5286000	5290000	Alright we're going to take a quick break but when we come back there is plenty more news to come.
5290000	5294000	The Frugal Question of the Week all about Zelda in the spirit of our interview earlier tonight.
5294000	5296000	Your emails and plenty more.
5296000	5301000	Your calls too when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio Episode 504 right after this.

5319000	5327000	And I want to use my voice to tell you that I like video games because I can kill people and not have to worry about going to prison.
5327000	5337000	Wow I always use my voice to tell you that Final Fantasy 7 is the greatest Final Fantasy game of all time and is not overrated.
5337000	5338000	Oh boy.
5339000	5348000	I want to use my voice to tell you that I would pay all my money for a Capcom fighting game crossover where no one bitches about to line up making dream candy.
5348000	5349000	Never happened.
5349000	5351000	I know but I do like that.
5351000	5353000	Good idea.
5353000	5356000	Can we go get food now?
5356000	5358000	Fuck yes I'm hungry.
5358000	5360000	Yeah I kind of want the pink berry.
5360000	5362000	Mmm pink berry.
5362000	5363000	Alright just got here.
5363000	5364000	Peace.
5364000	5365000	See ya.
5365000	5366000	Alright.
5368000	5372000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Episode number 504 in progress.
5372000	5373000	I want pink berry now.
5373000	5377000	Loki wants to use his voice to tell you that animes with boobies are better.
5379000	5380000	I want pink berry now.
5380000	5382000	Everything with boobies is better.
5382000	5388000	Um you know I can actually imagine a few things that putting boobs on would make it absolutely not better.
5388000	5390000	Could you imagine boobs with boobs?
5390000	5391000	That would be frightening.
5391000	5392000	Double boobs?
5392000	5395000	No no no no just boobs that have boobs.
5395000	5397000	Wouldn't that just be like a cow or something?
5397000	5398000	I don't know.
5398000	5399000	No.
5399000	5400000	That would be torpedo breasts.
5400000	5401000	No.
5401000	5402000	Alright look you guys are awkward.
5402000	5408000	Alright um I forgot to mention this during my gaming week but I should mention this device that's sitting on our studio table now.
5408000	5413000	I got an IK this week which thanks to Dark Soccer I was saying something about it on Facebook that it was on sale.
5413000	5415000	Did you get Blazing Star? Did you did you did you did you?
5415000	5416000	No but I.
5416000	5417000	Why not?
5417000	5426000	Well because I have I may or may not have a MAME emulator on the iPad and so I was playing Mega Man the Power Battle this week.
5426000	5428000	It's kinda awesome just saying.
5428000	5429000	You know what?
5429000	5430000	What?
5430000	5431000	Ugh.
5431000	5438000	I will check that out as well too but uh yeah I was having and I don't want to hear it about the whole like you shouldn't support MAME and piracy and all that.
5438000	5445000	I I bought every single stinking Capcom arcade bundle pack and every freaking.
5445000	5447000	You supported Game Room.
5447000	5448000	Yeah I did look.
5448000	5449000	Yeah exactly.
5449000	5452000	I bought I eat up all that retro shit when they put it out so.
5452000	5453000	Totally totally totally.
5453000	5455000	The the Metal Slug games are actually super fun.
5455000	5456000	Oh yeah I bet.
5456000	5458000	With the IKd but Blazing Star.
5458000	5460000	I told you how to get it to work right?
5460000	5465000	You start the game then you leave the game and go back into it and then the IKd will work with it.
5465000	5466000	Oh.
5466000	5467000	It won't right when you start up.
5467000	5469000	Well you know what else I have on there?
5469000	5479000	I have a Rygar which is awesome obviously the arcade version and I was I actually had it working once I think I think I took it out but I had Beatmania on there at one point.
5479000	5481000	Like the old school one yeah Beatmania you can do on there.
5481000	5484000	But the thing is I can't figure out how to map the buttons.
5484000	5490000	Yet so I'm kind of stuck with the default configuration so if I wanted to play Beatmania on that it would kind of suck.
5490000	5494000	You should use the make your joystick or scratch.
5494000	5495000	Yeah.
5495000	5496000	Just flick it with your hand.
5496000	5501000	It shouldn't be that hard if it means but you know I think it's just one two three four five.
5501000	5503000	Yeah I think so.
5503000	5504000	So.
5504000	5509000	Alright well anyway we're going to get back into some news here rapid fire news.
5509000	5510000	So Loki.
5510000	5515000	Alright so let's talk a little bit about the Sims.
5515000	5517000	Well actually SimCity.
5517000	5525000	SimCity is getting a 3.0 update this week and is attempting to fix the traffic problem again.
5525000	5529000	Because if you remember 2.0 kind of made some more problems.
5529000	5535000	So they're trying to fix that and so we'll have to see later this week.
5535000	5538000	She makes for some interesting reads.
5538000	5542000	Also they announced The Sims 4.
5542000	5551000	It's going to be coming next year on PC and it is going to be offline and single player.
5551000	5554000	They made sure to mention that.
5554000	5561000	And last but not least you may remember you know such wonderful games getting rebooted.
5561000	5567000	Like well Duke Nukem Forever Maybe is not a good example but Rise of the Triad.
5567000	5578000	Well now Shadow Warrior getting redone by Flying Wild Hog.
5578000	5583000	They're the developer and it's supposed to be published by Devolver Digital.
5583000	5586000	Which you know has done all sorts of awesome things so.
5587000	5591000	I kind of you know I almost forgot a little bit of Shadow Warrior.
5591000	5595000	I love Shadow Warrior because you know it had a slightly better version of the build engine.
5595000	5599000	So you could do like upstairs and downstairs.
5599000	5602000	Because remember the build engine you couldn't really like create rooms.
5602000	5604000	Like if you had an elevator or something like that.
5604000	5608000	You had to create like a teleporter that would teleport you to different room.
5608000	5612000	It was the limitations of the engine so.
5612000	5615000	Looks cool I can't wait.
5615000	5618000	Going back to the SimCity stories for a minute here at our chat room.
5618000	5622000	Live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster says great another traffic fix.
5622000	5625000	Haven't they had to fix the traffic in like every single patch they're doing something to it?
5625000	5631000	Yeah they have and it just hasn't worked.
5631000	5633000	Well you know traffic is a serious problem.
5633000	5637000	It's not you know if you can fix traffic that easy LA would have it figured out by now.
5637000	5642000	Well remember the last time they tried it the last patch like fucked up sewage or something like that.
5642000	5645000	I'm sure it'll get taken apart once they put it out.
5645000	5649000	Also forgot to mention that SimCity has reached 1.6 million in sales.
5649000	5652000	50% of that were online so.
5652000	5656000	That's not surprising I think.
5656000	5659000	Considering if you think about considering that you know.
5659000	5663000	I don't know a lot of people purchase PC games online nowadays.
5663000	5668000	Speaking of traffic just totally random aside question I heard this on the radio the other day.
5668000	5673000	Obviously LA is the worst city in the nation for traffic but do you know what the number two city in the nation is?
5673000	5675000	Atlanta Georgia.
5675000	5677000	It is not Atlanta Georgia.
5677000	5679000	Have you ever been in Atlanta driving?
5679000	5683000	I'm telling you it was not ranked number it might have been number three I don't know but it was not number two.
5683000	5686000	And it was not it was not Sacramento and it's not San Francisco on game day.
5686000	5688000	Nope it's not San Francisco either.
5688000	5691000	Honolulu second worst city for traffic.
5691000	5695000	Which is interesting but I guess when you think it's kind of all by itself out there.
5695000	5699000	And if they didn't build it right the first time there's not a lot of other places to build.
5699000	5701000	Makes sense.
5701000	5703000	Alright anyhow.
5703000	5706000	Actually I do have to agree with Prince Brightstar Boston is pretty bad.
5706000	5708000	Boston is very bad.
5708000	5711000	Seriously Atlanta is the worst traffic I have ever been in.
5711000	5714000	Bobby is Atlanta the worst yes or no?
5714000	5716000	No it's really bad.
5716000	5718000	It's really really bad.
5718000	5720000	Alright.
5720000	5724000	Let me move on to some Nintendo focused stories here.
5724000	5727000	First one is about Super Mario RPG.
5727000	5731000	Super Mario RPG is going to be a reward for Club Nintendo members.
5731000	5734000	You can get that on the Wii Virtual Console.
5734000	5738000	For 200 coins if you are a Club Nintendo member.
5738000	5741000	That's on the Wii Virtual Console not Wii U.
5741000	5745000	You can also get Maboshi's Arcade for WiiWare for 150.
5745000	5748000	3D Classics Excitebike for 150. Wasn't that free at one point?
5749000	5752000	ArtStyle Aquia for 100 coins.
5752000	5755000	That's on DSiWare on the 3DS.
5755000	5760000	That's a cool game that I really wish would have a sequel.
5760000	5762000	Mario RPG?
5762000	5764000	Oh yeah absolutely.
5764000	5768000	You might have 150 extra coins to spare if you purchase Super Metroid using coins.
5768000	5775000	Nintendo in a very interesting move decided to refund people who bought Super Metroid using 150 coins.
5775000	5780000	Because of the 30 cent promotion coming up on Wii U they decided to refund the coins.
5780000	5781000	How kind.
5781000	5786000	That is actually a very nice thing to do because I would have thought people should have been smarter and known that that was coming.
5786000	5789000	But that's pretty cool.
5789000	5791000	Good on you Nintendo.
5791000	5796000	And now you can use the coins to go buy a game that's almost as good as Super Metroid but not quite.
5796000	5800000	Because Super Metroid remember is greater than your favorite.
5800000	5805000	Alright and lastly when it comes to E3 this is really no surprise at all.
5805000	5811000	Reggie Fils-Aime and Shigeru Miyamoto are going to be hosting the pre-E3 presentation.
5811000	5815000	I mean duh right? Like those are the big personalities at Nintendo.
5815000	5817000	The biggest shock is that they say presentation.
5817000	5821000	Not a million presentations.
5821000	5824000	Well but there could still be future ones done by others.
5824000	5827000	I mean it's not always just the two of them in the videos.
5827000	5829000	I've seen plenty of other people in there.
5829000	5833000	Including one J.C. who I knew back in the DDR days.
5833000	5838000	They may have one before E3 and then a million during and after.
5838000	5839000	Okay I see I see.
5839000	5842000	A custom tailored Nintendo Direct.
5842000	5843000	Alright.
5843000	5849000	The presentation will be to selected media and it's going to take place before the show floor opens to the public.
5849000	5854000	Once the presentation is over members of the press gets to test out the titles before anyone else.
5854000	5856000	That's what they're doing.
5856000	5858000	They've already announced that was what they were doing.
5858000	5861000	But I'm saying that Reggie Fils-Aime and Miyamoto are hosting it.
5861000	5862000	Well cool.
5862000	5864000	Which is no surprise I'm sure.
5864000	5865000	I'm sure his body is ready.
5865000	5870000	I wish I could get in. Me too. I want my body to be ready.
5870000	5872000	Alright Dark Sakura.
5872000	5876000	Sorry I was complaining about Florida cops.
5876000	5882000	Apologies to any of our listeners who is a cop in Florida. I know you are not all assholes.
5882000	5883000	Okay.
5883000	5888000	So coming to the 3DS eShop is a Sonic Hedgehog.
5888000	5896000	Which is good news for everybody who is interested in playing that on your 3DS.
5896000	5901000	It's actually even got the Genesis model 2 audio.
5901000	5903000	Which you can listen to as well.
5903000	5906000	And there's also and this makes me pretty happy.
5907000	5914000	Dou Dompachi Saitai Ojo will be out for 360 and it will be region free.
5914000	5916000	So I can import the shit out of that.
5916000	5922000	I mean basically since it's pretty much not being localized you can just import it.
5922000	5924000	And that makes me super happy because I love Dou Dompachi.
5924000	5933000	And then last but not least GameStop is not going to be taking PS2 trade-ins anymore.
5933000	5937000	Even though they will still be selling the games.
5937000	5943000	As of June 1st they will not accept the console or related products for trade.
5943000	5945000	Assholes.
5945000	5948000	They're very excited about the PS4.
5948000	5952000	Let's be real though. I mean it's not so much that they're assholes.
5952000	5954000	They just need the shelf space.
5954000	5956000	But not because of this.
5956000	5961000	No. I think that they're missing out on a market.
5961000	5964000	Or they're going to be closing off an area of revenue.
5964000	5967000	But I think they're... I don't know. I just don't think it's very wise.
5967000	5972000	Well the flea markets will pick it up and the other retro game stores.
5972000	5974000	Like fair game and game trader.
5974000	5977000	Fair game is local in Sacramento but they are really awesome.
5977000	5979000	The one up the street here closed.
5979000	5985000	Even though you can still look inside it on the Google Maps thing which is creepy.
5985000	5986000	Funny.
5986000	5988000	Super creepy.
5988000	5991000	Which makes me wonder how old most of those pictures are.
5991000	5993000	Go figure.
5993000	5996000	Alright. Well if that does it for Dark Sakura's rapid fire news.
5996000	5999000	So we're going to go to the foogle question of the week.
5999000	6001000	I rapid fired that.
6001000	6004000	That's not the right theme song. What are you doing wrong with it?
6004000	6006000	Geez rap.
6006000	6011000	Facebook.com or Google Plus.
6011000	6013000	Slam those words together you get foogle plus.
6013000	6015000	But it's foogle.
6015000	6017000	Tonight on foogle.
6017000	6020000	We plugged the interview we had in our first half with Joe.
6020000	6023000	The creator of it's dangerous to go alone the movie.
6023000	6026000	And we thought since this was a documentary all about the Legend of Zelda.
6026000	6028000	We're going to ask our listeners this week.
6028000	6031000	What's your favorite memory of the Legend of Zelda series?
6031000	6033000	This could be something that happened in the game.
6033000	6035000	Or a memory you have about playing it.
6035000	6037000	We want to leave it wide open.
6037000	6039000	So let's go to some of the answers on Facebook first.
6039000	6042000	We'll start with Jeremy from the Koopa Club podcast.
6042000	6044000	I like them. They're fun.
6044000	6047000	One of my biggest and happiest memories from childhood.
6047000	6049000	Was playing the original NES Legend of Zelda.
6049000	6051000	With my older brother and sister.
6051000	6054000	We are not what I'd call a close family.
6054000	6056000	And we don't really have much in common.
6056000	6059000	But that game brought us all together as hokey as it sounds.
6059000	6061000	Exploring the dungeons.
6061000	6064000	Bombing every wall. Trying to burn every bush.
6064000	6067000	It was an amazing experience for me as a five year old.
6067000	6071000	I remember going around trying to set every single bush on fire in the game.
6071000	6073000	Because you want to see if there's any more secrets.
6073000	6076000	Did you do that in Dark Soccer? Did you set everything on fire?
6076000	6078000	Oh I did and I bombed everything.
6078000	6081000	And I tried to grab every single rock possible.
6081000	6083000	And I would bomb every wall.
6083000	6086000	I would run into every wall in a dungeon to see if I could walk through it.
6086000	6088000	I remember finding out on my own.
6089000	6093000	I remember finding out on my own that like the first five dungeons?
6093000	6096000	It might not be that many. It might only be like three or four.
6096000	6099000	You can bomb every single solitary wall.
6099000	6101000	That adjoins to another room.
6101000	6103000	But that doesn't work later on.
6103000	6105000	Just because a room is next to it doesn't mean you can bomb through it.
6105000	6107000	I know. Cool story.
6107000	6111000	I also think it's very cool that you were playing games that were as cool as Zelda with your family.
6111000	6114000	My mom didn't understand Zelda.
6114000	6116000	You know what my mom would play though?
6116000	6117000	The one game my mom would...
6117000	6120000	And she wouldn't pick up the controller but she'd just bark at me what to do.
6120000	6122000	Like, do that Rob. Do that.
6122000	6124000	Anticipation.
6124000	6125000	Do you remember this?
6125000	6126000	Yeah.
6126000	6128000	It was the little drawing game that was the board game.
6128000	6129000	I remember it.
6129000	6132000	And they would draw the little pictures and my mom would just sit back in the chair and go,
6132000	6136000	It's a trumpet. Rob. Rob, buzz in. It's a trumpet.
6136000	6138000	It's a trumpet, Rob.
6139000	6140000	Alright.
6140000	6142000	We need to get your mom back on the show.
6142000	6143000	Today would be a good day for that.
6143000	6145000	I did say Happy Mother's Day at the top of the show, right?
6145000	6146000	I really hope so.
6146000	6147000	Yeah.
6147000	6148000	Alright.
6148000	6149000	Just making sure.
6149000	6150000	Oh, I know it's also Bobby's birthday.
6150000	6151000	So, alright. Anyway.
6151000	6156000	If I neglected to do so in the first half, a Happy Mother's Day to all of the folks celebrating today.
6156000	6160000	Whether you are yourself a mom or have somebody who is celebrating.
6160000	6163000	Back to the Facebook question of the week.
6163000	6165000	Fugu question of the week.
6165000	6166000	Xplink says,
6166000	6170000	The first time playing Legend of Zelda for the first time it came out, after it came out,
6170000	6172000	and trying to help my friend beat the game.
6172000	6176000	Playing it for hours on end, going through and trying to find all of the dungeons.
6176000	6179000	Called the Nintendo Power Hotline just to get help for it.
6179000	6181000	And yes, my mother gave the OK for it.
6181000	6184000	Thus why I have the name Link for my handle.
6184000	6186000	Although the X-Link is a different story.
6186000	6188000	Well, I never knew that the Link part of that came from Zelda.
6188000	6191000	Remember when you had to get permission to call the tip line?
6191000	6192000	I never got.
6192000	6193000	I never did.
6193000	6194000	Yeah, I never.
6194000	6195000	Well.
6195000	6198000	We had some long distance phone bills at my house.
6198000	6201000	I never got said permission from my mom.
6201000	6204000	And so, you know, it was like, Rob, you are not calling Washington.
6204000	6206000	You don't need to figure it out.
6206000	6208000	You can figure it out, Rob.
6208000	6210000	I'd be like, Grandma, I'm calling that Nintendo line.
6210000	6212000	Why don't you write them a letter?
6212000	6215000	You only can talk to them for 10 minutes.
6215000	6216000	That was seriously.
6216000	6217000	I have to.
6217000	6218000	I have to.
6218000	6220000	I need to actually talk to my mom so I have my accent.
6220000	6223000	You only got 10 minutes to talk to those people and then you got to hang up.
6223000	6226000	I don't care if they're halfway through conversation.
6226000	6227000	Yes, ma'am.
6227000	6232000	I did get permission later on to call the official Sierra bulletin board system, which was a long distance call.
6232000	6235000	So I could download, like, King's Quest demos or something.
6235000	6237000	Alright, anyway.
6237000	6239000	Back to Foogle.
6239000	6241000	And Matt J. on Facebook says,
6241000	6245000	The Zelda series, along with Metroid, has always held a special place in my heart.
6245000	6247000	The first Zelda title I ever played was A Link to the Past.
6247000	6251000	It, along with Super Metroid, cemented my love of gaming.
6251000	6255000	One of my greatest summers as a child was 1995.
6255000	6260000	Me and my two best friends at the time played through several SNES titles, A Link to the Past and Super Metroid.
6260000	6263000	I remember many a summer day playing through A Link to the Past with them.
6263000	6267000	Yes, it was a single player title, but it felt like we were playing it together.
6267000	6271000	We would all huddle around my friend's small black and white TV, volume blaring as we went through the game.
6271000	6274000	I remember us getting all excited every time we beat a boss.
6274000	6278000	We would take turns with the game, especially when it got to a point one of us couldn't get past.
6278000	6280000	Just getting through the game seemed almost magical.
6280000	6283000	When you're 10 years old, getting through any game can seem magical, really.
6283000	6288000	It was a great summer, and there was something to be said about getting through a game together with friends.
6288000	6293000	Sadly, I've long since lost touch with my two friends, but the memories will never die.
6293000	6296000	It was due to that summer I developed my love for Metroid and Zelda.
6296000	6298000	That's a really good story.
6298000	6302000	I got a little, like for real, I got a little, little verklempt hearing that story.
6302000	6304000	Are you talking amongst yourselves?
6304000	6306000	I might be.
6306000	6313000	Well, you know, there's actually a bunch of chat going on right now about, you know, everyone's big retro games.
6313000	6315000	You know, playing with their parents.
6315000	6320000	And I was actually just recalling the cutthroat games my mother and I would have with Dr. Mario.
6320000	6322000	Cutthroat.
6322000	6325000	She would get mad.
6325000	6327000	I think you're cheating.
6327000	6331000	That's cool that you could play those games, because my mom would only play the game shows.
6331000	6336000	On Commodore 64, she would play Jeopardy and Family Feud with me.
6336000	6338000	But that's really it.
6338000	6340000	Anyway, it's kind of sad the way.
6340000	6344000	Sadly, I've long since lost touch with my two friends, but the memories will never die.
6344000	6349000	I just want to play that song that will take you back to that summer.
6354000	6359000	Okay, if you get on the table and start dancing, I'm leaving.
6359000	6362000	I'm just going to walk through the football field and pump my fist.
6362000	6364000	Yeah, I just began it.
6367000	6370000	Anyway, back to more Facebook answers.
6370000	6372000	James S. on the Fubo Question of the Week says,
6372000	6379000	Being six years old and finally completing A Link to the Past from start to finish without a guide, mind you, was one of my favorite childhood memories.
6379000	6383000	It took my grandmother and my cousins about a year to finish it.
6383000	6388000	To this day, I still play through it once every few years just to try and recapture that same magic from all those years ago.
6388000	6393000	There's only one other game that holds the same magic and memories for me, and that's Illusion of Gaia.
6393000	6396000	They just don't make them like they used to, eh guys?
6396000	6398000	Ain't that the truth?
6398000	6400000	Ain't that the truth?
6400000	6406000	Did you play through any adventure games, or was it just the competitive stuff that you played with your mom?
6406000	6414000	Well, my mom really liked playing Super Mario Brothers a lot, to the point where I would be chased out of my own room.
6415000	6418000	But she wasn't really into Zelda or anything like that.
6418000	6424000	And when I borrowed my friend's, by borrow I mean, I borrowed it and he moved. Copy?
6424000	6426000	So now it's yours.
6426000	6428000	Yeah, well that's also how I acquired my Chrono Trigger.
6428000	6432000	He hasn't asked for it back. I actually keep in touch with the guy and he has never asked for it back.
6432000	6440000	So, but I ended up playing through the first Zelda and my mom was like, you're playing that game.
6440000	6444000	Sorry, I'm looking on Twitter and I'm cracking up because Bobby tweeted a picture.
6444000	6448000	He's holding up the anticipation cartridge and he just tweeted, it's a trumpet.
6448000	6452000	I think one of the game pieces was a trumpet. I don't think that was actually...
6452000	6456000	No, I think there was like a meta, like one of the answers then was trumpet. It was very meta.
6456000	6460000	Like later in the game it would actually draw a trumpet.
6462000	6464000	I miss like good game show games like that.
6464000	6466000	And then there was one versus a hundred. Don't get me started.
6466000	6470000	You know what I miss actually as far as game shows go? Win, lose or draw.
6470000	6474000	They're making draw something into a game show which is the same thing.
6474000	6476000	I know, but draw something is actually pretty.
6476000	6480000	But it doesn't have Burt Reynolds and Burt Conroy. Conroy? What was his name?
6480000	6481000	Conroy.
6481000	6484000	Well it's just like how they made words with friends into a board game.
6484000	6487000	Or bejeweled into a board game.
6487000	6489000	Fuck, I just would play Scrabble.
6489000	6491000	Which was also a great game show.
6491000	6495000	You know what actually was also a good game show? Bumper Stumpers.
6495000	6497000	That was a great game show. On USA?
6497000	6498000	Chuck Woolry.
6498000	6499000	I sure do.
6499000	6500000	Chuck Woolry is the man.
6500000	6502000	It was on USA just before up all night.
6502000	6503000	All right.
6503000	6507000	Sayo Surumagawa says beating the water temple without help when I was 10.
6507000	6512000	Wicked says not a specific memory in game but an entire game itself.
6512000	6514000	Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.
6514000	6518000	It took every single thing that made the first Legend of Zelda good, multiplied it by 10,
6518000	6522000	then took everything I felt was bad in it and nullified it.
6522000	6525000	There was no bad in the original Legend of Zelda. What's wrong with you? I'm just kidding.
6525000	6526000	Zelda 2 maybe.
6526000	6527000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
6527000	6530000	I know people love Zelda 2 but ugh.
6530000	6535000	The graphics were colorful, the music was orchestral, the control was tight, the design was brilliant.
6535000	6539000	Granted I haven't played a Zelda game past Link's Awakening,
6539000	6543000	but I have to say what I have played A Link to the Past is the greatest Zelda game ever made.
6543000	6550000	Ragenator says my favorite memory is beating the first quest of the original Zelda game on the NES as a kid for the first time.
6550000	6556000	Andy R. lastly on Facebook says when I was younger I really wanted Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.
6556000	6561000	While I was visiting my grandmother my parents told me they'd buy me a game so off we went to the game store.
6561000	6566000	The whole way there I explained to my grandmother how there were two games and how they were related and such.
6566000	6568000	Straight out of Nintendo Power I'm sure.
6568000	6571000	When we got there my parents told me they'd only buy me one of them.
6571000	6573000	I picked one and we went home.
6573000	6576000	That night I was playing it and my grandmother came over with a grin,
6576000	6580000	handed me the other game, and told me to keep it a secret from my parents.
6580000	6582000	Aww.
6582000	6586000	That was so good. I'm like choking here. That's a great Mother's Day story.
6586000	6589000	My grandma bought me a Killer Instinct.
6591000	6593000	That explains a lot.
6593000	6601000	She took me to four different stores to buy Killer Instinct until we found it at Rest in Peace Montgomery Wards.
6601000	6604000	To be fair I had to- no it wasn't my mom it was my dad.
6604000	6607000	My dad was the only one that would go to software etc. and all that with me.
6607000	6609000	So when Mortal Kombat came out and all that.
6609000	6611000	And I pitched a fit until they gave me my CD.
6613000	6615000	You? Pitching a fit? Even younger?
6615000	6617000	Girl.
6617000	6620000	Alright. Let's go to Google+. Just a couple answers over there.
6620000	6622000	The first one from Rettertainment.
6622000	6625000	When we were kids my sister and I both had our own Game Boys.
6625000	6628000	This was the original large black and white Game Boy.
6628000	6631000	My sister broke her Game Boy by hitting it while she was playing it.
6631000	6634000	My sister begged and pleaded with me to allow her to play with my Game Boy.
6634000	6640000	I said no because she broke hers and I was sure she would break mine in the same way my sister broke hers.
6640000	6644000	After her typical high amount of whining and crying to my parents.
6644000	6649000	My parents told me to let my sister play my Game Boy despite me being absolutely sure that she would break it.
6649000	6653000	My sister did end up breaking my Game Boy by hitting it as she was playing it.
6653000	6656000	She was playing Zelda Link's Awakening at the time.
6656000	6662000	This might not sound like a good memory but it is because I was proven to be right and I like being right.
6662000	6666000	I especially like being right when my sister and my parents are wrong.
6669000	6670000	Love it.
6670000	6677000	And lastly Flaco Jones saying the ending to Link's Awakening was the best video game ending I have ever experienced to that point.
6677000	6680000	And still ranks up there with my favorite endings ever.
6680000	6685000	The Ballad of the Wind Fish just adds to it by being the most memorable Zelda game moment for me.
6686000	6691000	I read every answer tonight. I shortened some of them a little bit for time but every answer if you want to see the complete answers.

6695000	6699000	It's not too late to add your response either because the people that posted before will see it.
6699000	6701000	So great job tonight you guys.
6701000	6703000	I loved some of those stories.
6703000	6709000	The big memory ones about Grandma and about the two friends you don't talk to anymore.
6709000	6713000	That got me in a special place. It did.
6713000	6715000	Alright. You alright?
6715000	6717000	I was thinking about my grandma.
6717000	6718000	Yeah.
6718000	6719000	You know what else she was responsible for?
6719000	6721000	Was this the same one who got you Killer Instinct?
6721000	6722000	Yes.
6722000	6723000	Oh wow.
6723000	6725000	I'll go ahead and just give the quick, quick story.
6725000	6731000	She's got a dead hip socket, had three strokes and cerebral vasculitis.
6731000	6738000	Meaning that she has swelling in her arteries and veins and everything in her brain.
6738000	6741000	And two aneurysms.
6741000	6744000	I talked to her the other day. She was just fine.
6744000	6747000	And I remember that she also...
6747000	6750000	And I don't think she actually realized what she was getting me at the time.
6750000	6754000	But she also got me my Kirby's Avalanche.
6754000	6757000	Which you know my love for all things peel, peel.
6757000	6764000	She got me my entire collection of Red Hot Chili Peppers cassettes at the time.
6764000	6767000	Because I was super, super obsessed with Red Hot Chili Peppers.
6767000	6768000	Really?
6768000	6770000	In high school.
6770000	6775000	And then she put up with me blasting Radiohead at all hours of the night.
6775000	6777000	My grandma is the best.
6777000	6781000	And she would always say that she was trying not to spoil me.
6781000	6783000	But she did spoil me pretty bad.
6783000	6786000	And she took care of me when my mom moved to Arizona.
6786000	6788000	We'll give her a hug for all of us when we go to Alabama.
6788000	6790000	I will. I will.
6790000	6792000	Let's move on with some more news tonight.
6792000	6793000	Loki.
6793000	6794000	Alright.
6794000	6801000	So we've been kind of talking about how there's not a lot of games on the Wii U.
6801000	6806000	And unfortunately not a lot of games from EA on the Wii U.
6806000	6809000	And it doesn't sound like that's going to be changing anytime soon.
6809000	6816000	Because the brand new Frostbite 3 engine that they're going to be using for Battlefield 4.
6816000	6820000	And I think I want to say a lot of the upcoming sports games.
6820000	6823000	Like they're going to be going with the Frostbite 3 engine.
6823000	6825000	That's where the next Mass Effect is.
6825000	6828000	Yes. Dragon Age, Mass Effect.
6828000	6831000	They will not run on the Wii U.
6831000	6833000	So.
6833000	6834000	Uh oh.
6834000	6835000	Yeah. That's not good.
6835000	6840000	And I think, I mean, you could say that they may be able to port it to Wii U.
6840000	6842000	If they created another engine that could ride it.
6842000	6845000	You know, maybe like an upgraded Frostbite 2 engine.
6845000	6850000	Kind of like how they do with some of the Unreal 3 stuff or whatever.
6850000	6852000	But is it really worth it to them?
6852000	6858000	I mean, they're just kind of saying, do we really want to put this much effort into creating a new engine?
6858000	6862000	To only sell like maybe 100,000 copies, if that?
6862000	6865000	Well then I bet Mass Effect 3 didn't exactly sell very well.
6865000	6867000	But it's because there wasn't 1 and 2.
6867000	6873000	Well that and the whole preview, whatever the Genesis 2 was, was shit.
6873000	6874000	Utter shit.
6874000	6879000	Even if they just didn't have the gamepad functioning in 1 and 2, just port them over.
6879000	6880000	God.
6880000	6885000	But I guess it's easier for me to sit here and say, just cram it from that box into that box.
6885000	6888000	Just amp up the graphics in level 3.
6888000	6889000	I'm sure they could have done that.
6889000	6895000	But I'm willing to bet a lot of the reasons why they don't have games being ported over there is
6895000	6899000	Nintendo probably requires a certain amount of connectivity with the gamepad.
6899000	6903000	And if they're saying, okay listen, you have to use the gamepad in some function.
6903000	6907000	That's probably why you see a lot of these games not getting Wii U ports.
6907000	6912000	YYR in chat needs some clarification. Are they developing the same engine for 360 and PS3?
6912000	6913000	Or is this for the next...
6913000	6916000	Wait, so 360 won't run on the Wii U?
6916000	6918000	That's weird.
6918000	6920000	That's because no one cares about the Wii U.
6920000	6923000	Well I thought that they built the Wii U to be similar in structure to 360.
6923000	6929000	Yeah because the new game, Battlefield 4, it is a current gen release as well as next gen.
6929000	6931000	And it will be running on that.
6931000	6938000	Well, if you can't get the next Mass Effect and Dragon Age games, why not get the next best thing?
6938000	6940000	Converted smartphone games.
6940000	6941000	What?
6941000	6943000	Alright, well maybe that's not really the next best thing.
6943000	6946000	But it's something that the Wii U will have going for it.
6946000	6951000	They're coaxing smartphone developers to adapt their apps for the system.
6951000	6956000	This is according to sources, so take it with a grain of salt, but it's in the Japan Times.
6956000	6962000	Nintendo, quote, has offered professional use conversion software, quote, to certain app devs
6962000	6967000	in the hopes that smartphone software could help boost the Wii U's sales figures.
6967000	6972000	I'm assuming that's just to kind of boost up some of the eShop content,
6972000	6978000	which we've heard is very indie friendly to begin with, but I'm not sure that alone is going to save the Wii U.
6978000	6984000	I mean, granted, a robust downloadable title stuff will help tremendously,
6984000	6988000	but it's not going to be one on those mobile games alone.
6988000	6992000	I think most people who want to play mobile phone games will get a mobile phone.
6992000	6994000	Or already have one.
6994000	6996000	That's right.
6996000	6998000	Or they'll get an Ouya.
6998000	7000000	Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura.
7000000	7003000	Well, we do have some news.
7003000	7008000	This is something that I thought was really cool, and I'm going to be checking it out.
7008000	7010000	I haven't quite yet, but I've been reading up on it.
7010000	7017000	There is a game called GeoGuessr that is, it basically uses Google Maps,
7017000	7020000	and it drops you in a location.
7020000	7026000	And you have only a few, you can go a few blocks, you can walk around.
7026000	7031000	It's sort of like you were, you know, kidnapped and got away, and you have no fucking clue where you are.
7031000	7038000	So you use your clues around, and then you have a map, and you can pick on the map where you are.
7038000	7041000	And the closer you get, the more points you get.
7041000	7046000	So you have five rounds, and so by the end of it, you can share your scores with your friends.
7046000	7048000	You can be competitive.
7048000	7057000	And they actually are saying on the GeoGuessr Twitter that he's working on other type of competitive play options.
7057000	7066000	And there's this one scene on here where it's just showing a plain road with dirt around it,
7066000	7068000	and you have to figure out where you are, so it's really...
7068000	7074000	Which is sadly what most of it looks like, most of Google Maps looks like if you really think about it.
7074000	7076000	Like that one that you're on right there, that picture?
7076000	7077000	Yeah.
7077000	7082000	To me, I would put that on the stretch between Nevada and...
7082000	7085000	Let me look at this really big here. Does it say where it's at?
7085000	7087000	No, I don't think so.
7087000	7092000	Well, you have to use some educated. It's not in the flatlands because you see mountains in the background.
7092000	7099000	That's what I'm saying, the stretch between Henderson and Las Vegas. Not Henderson.
7099000	7104000	There's a big stretch of road that actually runs from Phoenix to Las Vegas.
7104000	7107000	And I've been there, and it looks just like it.
7107000	7109000	That could just easily be I-5, honestly.
7109000	7111000	That could be I-5.
7111000	7116000	I don't know. Too bad you don't have smell-o-vision because if you smell cow death, you know you're on the I-5.
7116000	7119000	And you drive right past Kalschwitz.
7119000	7123000	I like games out of Google Maps, though. Things like that. I like those little exploration games.
7123000	7125000	There's so much cool shit on Google Maps.
7125000	7132000	And to the Wii U's credit, that's one of the cool things I've enjoyed on the Wii U is that Google exploration thing where you can actually panorama around.
7132000	7134000	But you know what I would love to see?
7134000	7137000	Is a Google Maps integrated Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?
7137000	7139000	Now that's awesome.
7139000	7143000	Couldn't you see that? And you have to do the shop view to see if she's inside a place.
7143000	7144000	Oh, that's rad.
7144000	7146000	Okay, don't steal my ideas.
7146000	7147000	Patent pending.
7147000	7148000	Patent pending.
7148000	7152000	You heard it here first. I'm gonna be starting a Kickstarter tomorrow.
7152000	7154000	Except, wait a minute.
7154000	7155000	Hiring programmers.
7155000	7157000	You don't own Carmen Sandiego, so...
7157000	7158000	I'll be like...
7158000	7161000	We're gonna do... I'm gonna be the star. It'll be Where the Fuck is Jamie now?
7161000	7164000	There you go. There you go.
7164000	7165000	So...
7165000	7167000	When in doubt, change the star to yourself.
7167000	7168000	Yeah.
7168000	7169000	Great logic.
7169000	7170000	Yeah, it'll be like...
7170000	7173000	You know, we haven't had an OLR dream game in a while. Maybe that's...
7173000	7176000	So that's our new dream game, Where the Fuck is Jamie?
7176000	7178000	Where the Fuck is Jamie now?
7181000	7182000	What do you think, Loki?
7182000	7185000	If you were gonna make this game realistic, it'd be in her pajamas at home.
7187000	7188000	Found her again.
7188000	7189000	She's in the same spot.
7189000	7192000	She's at 7-Eleven buying Guinness. Again.
7192000	7193000	Click. Click.
7193000	7196000	No, no, no, no, no. I live in Citrus Heights. It's the Tower Mart.
7197000	7199000	Wait a minute. She's at Disneyland.
7199000	7200000	Yep.
7200000	7201000	Woo!
7201000	7204000	She dragged Dan to a Starbucks saying, coffee.
7204000	7207000	No, no, no. We go to It's a Grind. Remember, it's near my house.
7207000	7208000	Sorry.
7208000	7209000	No, no.
7209000	7211000	Why don't you just give the listeners your address while you're at it?
7211000	7213000	Do you know what? Honestly, if we were gonna be...
7213000	7216000	If we were gonna do, like, places that I actually go to,
7216000	7219000	it would be Disneyland, the Bravo Cheese Farms.
7221000	7224000	And the computer room at my house in my pajamas.
7224000	7225000	And maybe Becky's house.
7225000	7229000	Prince Brightstar in chat says, needs a co-star Waldo-type character.
7229000	7230000	Well, that would be me.
7231000	7233000	We'll have to put you in the beanie.
7234000	7238000	And, uh, I don't know. If it was like a road trip locator thing,
7238000	7242000	then we can have, you know, Loki building Grand Theft Auto maps.
7242000	7244000	Frisbee says, have you tried checking Pinkberry?
7245000	7246000	You know.
7246000	7248000	You know, I was the mayor of three Pinkberries.
7248000	7252000	I hate giving them all this free publicity, but that cookies and cream?
7252000	7254000	Oh, my God.
7254000	7255000	I need to go.
7255000	7256000	Oh, so good.
7256000	7257000	Because I'm...
7257000	7258000	So good.
7258000	7259000	I just haven't been given a fuck. We have It's a...
7259000	7261000	It's at my house in M&M's, which I brought some here.
7261000	7262000	Alright, anyway.
7262000	7263000	Yeah.
7264000	7265000	Hi, Loki.
7265000	7268000	You have something besides where the fuck is Jamie now?
7268000	7269000	Yes.
7269000	7272000	Um, let's talk about Google Play.
7272000	7275000	You know, going back to mobile phone games again.
7275000	7280000	Um, Google Play Games is apparently something that leaked out.
7280000	7283000	Uh, thanks to the Android Police.
7283000	7285000	Yes, that's actually a website.
7285000	7289000	And, uh, it's from, I guess, Play Services APK Teardown.
7289000	7292000	And what is Google Play Games?
7292000	7295000	Well, it's basically their version of Game Center.
7295000	7300000	It's got all sorts of wonderful features, including, you know, in-game chat.
7300000	7307000	Um, they're saying that cloud saves, achievements, leaderboards, uh, invites, matchmaking, lobbies.
7307000	7309000	All sorts of fun stuff.
7309000	7313000	And, uh, that will be coming, I guess, soon.
7313000	7317000	And maybe they're saying that, um, it could be even revealed this week.
7317000	7320000	I guess Google's IO event is this week.
7321000	7323000	Um, it'd be interesting.
7323000	7328000	I would be kind of interested to see if they're gonna kind of translate this into almost like a console.
7328000	7331000	I mean, it'd be interesting.
7331000	7333000	I know Google-
7333000	7335000	Just what we need. Another console.
7335000	7337000	We've already got the big three. We've got the Ouya.
7337000	7340000	Now we just had a report on this mobile phone console.
7340000	7342000	There's too many consoles.
7342000	7345000	I do not want Google to make a console.
7345000	7347000	I want Google to team up with somebody else.
7347000	7350000	Which, who knows? Could Microsoft team up with Google?
7350000	7352000	No, they're not really friends, right?
7352000	7355000	But then again, to take out Apple, they might. Who knows?
7355000	7360000	I don't know. There's that Apple-Google rivalry, I think, that they would form an axis.
7360000	7362000	To take down the mighty fruit.
7362000	7366000	Interesting. You know, Apple hasn't announced anything in a while either. It's been a very long time.
7366000	7367000	No new iPads, no new iPhones.
7367000	7368000	They're taking a nap. They're taking a nap.
7368000	7370000	A little nap? A little napple?
7370000	7372000	An apple.
7372000	7375000	Alright. Well, we know that-
7375000	7378000	And Prince Brightstar in chat says, no love for PC.
7378000	7380000	Well, a PC- I don't know if that's in reference to what I said.
7380000	7382000	A PC, I don't really count as a console.
7382000	7385000	But obviously, yes, all these games go on PC too.
7385000	7388000	I mean, there's some things you can only get on PC.
7388000	7390000	Like World of Warcraft.
7390000	7395000	Coming out soon is the PlayStation 4, which we'll be getting some games-
7395000	7396000	Can we get well on Mac?
7396000	7399000	That were on PC. Well, sorry. Yes. Yes, you can.
7399000	7404000	PlayStation 4 is going to get Diablo 3, which to now is only on PC and Mac.
7404000	7407000	But PlayStation 4 is going to have that share button.
7407000	7412000	Where you can instantly share things to Facebook or whatever the PSN that's built in and so forth.
7412000	7416000	But something about the share button that's coming out this week.
7416000	7420000	Shuhei Yoshida, who is the president of Sony Worldwide Studios,
7420000	7424000	noted in an interview with 4Gamer, which is a Japanese site,
7424000	7428000	that the share button is limited to what developers will allow.
7428000	7430000	Which makes a lot of sense.
7430000	7433000	You don't necessarily want people to be able to share everything.
7433000	7440000	For example, like on the Vita, you can have certain scenes disable this.
7440000	7444000	So you can take a screenshot and the share function might share the screenshot.
7444000	7448000	But you might not be able to actually take a video of the entire final boss.
7448000	7453000	So you wouldn't be able to share the ending of the game two hours after the game launches.
7453000	7456000	Or something like that. So that makes sense.
7456000	7462000	But what else I thought was interesting about the interview is that the video sharing function was inspired by
7462000	7468000	the fact that Shuhei Yoshida wanted to play Dark Souls all day long.
7468000	7473000	So he would watch videos of other people playing the game since he was too busy.
7473000	7475000	So that's where the share button came from.
7475000	7479000	So that Dark Souls 3 or whatever ends up on the PlayStation 4,
7479000	7483000	he'll be able to use the share button to watch other people play.
7483000	7485000	So he's a lawyer.
7485000	7487000	Maybe he likes to watch.
7487000	7491000	Well, he might like to watch, but we like to read.
7491000	7493000	And every week you guys email us.
7493000	7496000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7496000	7499000	DarkSakura ever so happily opens up the mailbag,
7499000	7502000	dives in and finds a few emails to read for you.
7502000	7504000	Right now, DarkSakura.
7504000	7506000	You know what, every time I look at the mailbag,
7506000	7508000	Eddie Inzer's voice goes into my head going,
7508000	7510000	IT'S ALL STICKY!
7511000	7513000	Hi, everyone at OLR.
7513000	7515000	This is your friendly neighborhood rage-inator.
7515000	7518000	Unfortunately, I do not have any gaming-related topics this week,
7518000	7524000	but I do have some good news to geek out over.
7524000	7534000	You could say I have some perfect news.
7534000	7540000	As of 3.30pm EDT, on Friday 5-10-13, I am the proud-as-hell cat owner.
7540000	7543000	Proud-as-all-hell cat owner. I saw your kitty and your kitty is cute.
7543000	7545000	I'm sorry, I was very busy when you messaged me.
7545000	7550000	I went to my local SPCA and adopted the most adorable 2-year-old male cat
7550000	7554000	at the SPCA named Anakin, who is mostly white with some black patches.
7554000	7557000	I swear, this cat's back looks like a Rorschach test.
7557000	7559000	It's awesome. You should name him Rorschach.
7559000	7564000	But when you beg him for mercy, he might say no.
7564000	7565000	I don't know.
7565000	7566000	He'll say meow.
7566000	7568000	Meow.
7568000	7573000	He's extremely friendly and playful. Granted, due to the new environment,
7573000	7577000	he's been hiding under my bed for a while, but I'm sure he'll warm up to my place.
7577000	7578000	Smile heart.
7578000	7581000	I haven't had the opportunity to take his picture yet and upload it yet,
7581000	7584000	but I'm working on it and I hope he'll be comfortable enough around my place
7584000	7588000	by Sunday evening when your show airs and you three take calls
7588000	7591000	that that way the three of you get to see him.
7591000	7593000	Now, I do like to propose a poll for your show.
7593000	7596000	Do I keep Anakin as a cat's name or do I name him after Booger,
7596000	7598000	the character from Revenge of the Nerds movies?
7598000	7600000	I still think you should name him Rorschach.
7600000	7604000	We're not polling it because Anakin is a clear better name than Booger.
7604000	7606000	I don't know. I had a friend that had a cat named Booger.
7606000	7611000	I told you about Dan's grandfather, named his cats Hiss and Spit.
7611000	7615000	And then I had a friend in high school that had a cat named Bitch.
7616000	7619000	And I know someone now who has a cat named Asshole.
7619000	7621000	But Bitch is a dog.
7621000	7625000	Irony, Rob. Irony. It's very hipster, okay?
7625000	7632000	Now, Rob, I'll let you finish, but I have to say that I have the greatest kitty ever.
7632000	7635000	This email is brought to you by Fuzzy Wuzzy Kitties.
7635000	7636000	No, you don't.
7636000	7637000	Come here, Sanrio. Sanrio.
7637000	7639000	Sanrio is under your bed.
7639000	7641000	Yeah, Sanrio hates people.
7641000	7643000	I love Midna so fucking much.
7643000	7645000	Midna is super fucking adorable.
7645000	7650000	You should just rename your Tumblr Fuck Yeah Midna because that's all it is.
7650000	7652000	It's not all it is.
7652000	7654000	You already have like seven Tumblr accounts.
7654000	7656000	What's one more? You need a Fuck Yeah Midna.
7656000	7658000	I actually made one for one of the fanfics I'm writing.
7658000	7661000	See? How many Tumblers do you have?
7661000	7664000	Fuck, hold on. I have my main. I have that one.
7664000	7668000	I have sleep waking, which is my art. I have an art history Tumblr.
7668000	7671000	I barely have enough shit to post to one Tumblr.
7671000	7673000	I have mass affecting. I have mass affecting.
7673000	7675000	I have one Tumblr. Hello Robbie.
7675000	7678000	If you want to follow me on Tumblr. Hello Robbie. R-O-B-B-I-E.
7678000	7680000	I have seven Tumblers.
7680000	7681000	Do you really?
7681000	7682000	I really do.
7682000	7687000	I wasn't lying. This is an intervention.
7687000	7689000	You know what? Bite me.
7689000	7695000	I did my art history blog just because I know not everyone gives a shit about
7695000	7699000	Destiel and the Bauhaus movement, okay?
7699000	7703000	So I made that one and then Mass Effect started taking over my main one
7703000	7708000	so I made my Mass Effect blog and whatever. Don't judge me.
7708000	7711000	ActDeaf suggests name him Anagar.
7711000	7713000	Anagan plus Booger.
7713000	7714000	You know I think-
7714000	7715000	Name him Rorschach.
7715000	7719000	Now Alan obviously named the cats because they were already ten years old
7719000	7720000	by the time I got in the picture.
7720000	7722000	But I believed when Alan named Maruko,
7722000	7725000	I think that was two things combined like that.
7725000	7727000	I think from what he told me.
7727000	7732000	Okay and actually Queen Simeon in chat says Holstein.
7732000	7736000	Because he's colored like a cat.
7736000	7737000	Alright next email.
7737000	7739000	It's a cute kid email.
7739000	7743000	Too many cats, not enough games. Although then again there's no such thing as too many cats.
7743000	7745000	I was about to say, you know the rule.
7745000	7748000	The internet is made for cats.
7748000	7749000	And porn.
7749000	7750000	But mostly cats.
7750000	7751000	And porn.
7751000	7752000	And porn.
7752000	7753000	Cats.
7753000	7755000	I see what you did there.
7755000	7756000	Cat porn?
7759000	7760000	I like pussy.
7760000	7764000	You know, don't get me started on the furry community.
7764000	7768000	I love, no I actually really like fursuiters.
7768000	7771000	I love the care and attention that go into the costumes.
7771000	7773000	There's just some art I don't need to see.
7773000	7776000	But they're welcome to draw it and I just won't look at it.
7776000	7779000	That's my approach toward any fandom.
7779000	7781000	You can enjoy your fandom, enjoy your ship.
7781000	7782000	I don't have to look at it.
7782000	7785000	Don't get me wrong, I like Muppets.
7785000	7788000	I just don't like Muppets, you know.
7788000	7791000	Trust me, if it exists someone has slashed it.
7791000	7793000	This is the internet.
7793000	7801000	Okay, this is from, I'm just gonna say Sam because I don't sign it.
7801000	7802000	It's just Sam.
7802000	7805000	Hello O.L.R. Crew, I love the show.
7805000	7806000	Hi Sam, thanks Sam.
7806000	7808000	Thank you Rob.
7808000	7814000	I say Nintendo should have checked with developers before the release of the Wii U to see if the console was good to go.
7814000	7819000	Third party devs have no obligation to make games for any system.
7819000	7822000	Nintendo may have to support their own console this time around.
7822000	7825000	Hey, Microsoft and Sony have also had their bad days.
7825000	7829000	I think we have also made that point on the show, I do agree.
7829000	7833000	Just because you have a system don't mean people's gonna put shit on it.
7833000	7834000	In the story.
7834000	7836000	They ain't got time for that shit.
7836000	7839000	So, last email.
7839000	7846000	Hey O.L.R. Crew, I wanted to tip my hat in along with Loki and Sky's complaints about Nintendo's game from Episode 503.
7846000	7850000	Both of you brought up perfectly valid points and I want to bring up an issue too.
7850000	7855000	Namely with Nintendo not putting enough content in their games to make them feel, quote, complete.
7855000	7862000	For example, Wii Sports Resort was touted to be a major upgrade from the first Wii Sports.
7862000	7870000	I don't own Wii Sports Resorts, though after taking a look at the FAQ for it, I'm convinced it's just a small step up with all the new mini games included.
7870000	7876000	I understand Wii Sports and other Nintendo games that typically star Miis are intended for casual audiences.
7876000	7885000	But why won't Nintendo put in effort to toss in features aside from online multiplayer, like your Mii having stats that affect gameplay or a complete fleshed out tournament mode.
7885000	7893000	Not only would these features appeal to core players, it would give the casuals a sense of progress and an enticing reason to come back to the game.
7893000	7899000	I actually agree with that. That would catch me playing it instead of, ugh, I hit the ball.
7899000	7906000	For real, I really wish Nintendo would, it just pisses me off.
7906000	7913000	Nintendo needs to steal some people from Microsoft or even Sony that get online better, that get the enhanced value of it.
7913000	7922000	It really, it just pains me that Nintendo won't try to advance the social aspect of gaming online.
7922000	7928000	But then again, they made buku bucks off of party games, so you know what, whatever works for them, right?
7928000	7938000	Well, it's also Nintendo which I think still refuses to, it's like they put, we're not crossing the line, we're not crossing the line, we'll touch the line but we aren't crossing it.
7938000	7942000	We do things our way. We do things the Miyamoto way.
7942000	7948000	I also believe my beef with Nintendo applies to some of the flagship games too.
7948000	7958000	New Super Mario Bros. U only unlocks one extra world after you beat the game whereas Super Mario 3D Land put up another eight whole worlds that are substantially tougher.
7958000	7961000	Substantially. I'm all tongue tied.
7961000	7967000	And how many people know that the upcoming Super Luigi U DLC only allows 100 seconds per stage?
7968000	7969000	Really?
7969000	7974000	Hearing that gives me the impression Nintendo is being cheap by not offering stages of standard length.
7974000	7977000	Well, we do like it long.
7977000	7984000	OLR crew, please cheer me up by answering this question. What are some of the games you've invested an ass load of time into?
7984000	7985000	Mouse effect.
7985000	7990000	No, stay mad. I'm just kidding, I'll answer. What's the rest of it?
7990000	7999000	I personally sunk somewhere over 2,000 hours into Phantasy Star Online a few years ago and more recently I played the Binding of Isaac for over 600 hours.
7999000	8002000	Stay fresh everyone and don't be a cudwafter.
8002000	8004000	Spelled like the type that cows chew.
8004000	8006000	Cudwafter.
8006000	8007000	Cudwafter.
8007000	8009000	That's like gonna be my favorite game name ever.
8009000	8011000	And that's from the Nasty Canasta.
8011000	8014000	One of my favorite listener names by the way.
8015000	8019000	Cause I always just imagine a game of like Strip Canasta, like the card game, but anyway.
8019000	8020000	Strip Canasta?
8020000	8022000	Cause it's Nasty Canasta.
8022000	8024000	You know the card game?
8024000	8025000	I know.
8025000	8026000	Alright.
8026000	8029000	It's like Dirty P-Nuckle.
8032000	8033000	P now P-Nuckle?
8036000	8040000	That's like your sister or brother would be Dirty P-Nuckle.
8040000	8041000	Dirty P-Nuckle.
8043000	8046000	Anyway, what was the question? You didn't even ask for that.
8046000	8047000	Fuck, I just closed it.
8047000	8049000	Oh, what game have you...
8049000	8050000	Sunk a lot of time into.
8050000	8055000	World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XI, and insert MMO here.
8055000	8058000	Mass Effect 3, a disgusting amount with a multiplayer, has really enhanced that.
8058000	8060000	I'm actually gonna be starting over on the whole series again.
8060000	8068000	I am going to keep Dramamine by my computer and play through the first Mass Effect again because I love the story in it best of any of them.
8068000	8071000	But I get so damn motion sick.
8071000	8077000	I turn off the film grain, I turn off the wiggle, whatever, the motion blur.
8077000	8080000	Still get sicker than anything on the stupid Mako missions.
8080000	8083000	What about you, Loki? Grand Theft Auto?
8083000	8085000	Grand Theft Auto.
8085000	8087000	Alien Defense Force, Earth Defense Force.
8087000	8090000	Yeah, Earth Defense Force, Saints Row.
8090000	8096000	We even called Diddy a bit because we played it for multiplayer, but I don't play a ton of that.
8096000	8101000	Probably Grand Theft Auto IV. It's a lot of fun. I don't know.
8101000	8106000	It's funny that I was talking to Dan about me playing Ragnarok Online 2 because he's like,
8106000	8111000	Well, you only played the first one for ten years, which is true.
8111000	8112000	Something like that.
8112000	8120000	Well, I played Ragnarok Online since it was in the Japanese beta because I started playing it in Japanese.
8120000	8123000	And then I moved over to IRO when they opened the beta here.
8123000	8126000	And then I played through paid IRO.
8126000	8129000	And then I went to free servers.
8129000	8135000	You know, I'm actually one of the few people that would still have my original account intact because I was a beta tester.
8135000	8136000	Oh, nice.
8136000	8138000	Yeah. That was another one that ate a lot of my time.
8138000	8142000	Civilization 1. I played a disgusting amount of that on PC.
8142000	8144000	I'm not surprised at all.
8144000	8146000	Alright. More emails? Or was that it?
8146000	8147000	That was it.
8147000	8149000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8149000	8151000	I can't believe I didn't even say this.
8151000	8157000	I would play Super Street Fighter 2 on my SNES all the time.
8157000	8161000	I would have people over who were like, We're gonna play games. We're not playing Super Street Fighter 2.
8161000	8163000	And it's like, Okay, Kirby's Avalanche.
8163000	8166000	Those were my two SNES days.
8166000	8167000	Good times.
8167000	8169000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
8179000	8194000	I have a few FUs because I have been carrying quite a bit of angst this past week.
8194000	8198000	FU number one goes to my stupid allergies.
8198000	8200000	I have developed a weed allergy.
8200000	8202000	And Dan brought me donuts last night.
8202000	8204000	And I was like, Donuts? I'll eat the hell out of those.
8204000	8206000	Nope. Stick.
8207000	8209000	And then to plane ticket costs.
8209000	8211000	Okay, get this.
8211000	8214000	New Orleans is a much bigger airport than Gulfport, right?
8214000	8221000	But it would have cost me another 75 to 100 bucks to fly into New Orleans.
8221000	8224000	Which I wouldn't do anyway because it's three hours from Mobile.
8224000	8226000	Whereas Gulfport is like an hour and a half.
8226000	8233000	And if I had flown into Mobile, it would have bumped up my plane ticket almost to another $300 because it's so much smaller.
8233000	8240000	And then I was thinking, well, you know what? If I stay a full two weeks, you know, arrive on a Tuesday, leave on a Tuesday,
8240000	8243000	yeah, that's going to be a lot better for my cost. No.
8243000	8251000	I'm leaving on a Thursday. If I had stayed until Tuesday the following week, it would have bumped my ticket up by like another 150 bucks.
8251000	8257000	It's stupid. It is completely stupid how much plane tickets cost.
8257000	8260000	And then all the shit you have to go through when you get to the airport.
8260000	8262000	And 50 bucks to check in a bag and all that crap too.
8262000	8268000	Oh my God. You know what? I seriously looked at Amtrak, but it would have taken me a week to get there.
8268000	8272000	And as much as I would love to ride the train, I don't have that kind of time.
8272000	8277000	I even paid an extra $35 so that I could get the shortest flight possible.
8277000	8283000	Because the flights that wanted to give me the lowest price possible were something like 10 hours, including two layovers.
8283000	8288000	And I was like, the moment I see the Atlanta airport on there, I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
8288000	8292000	Atlanta airport is like the bane of my existence.
8292000	8296000	Don't tell me this because I have to fly to Atlanta for Dragon Con.
8296000	8303000	No, Rob. Just one awesome thing, though, is the never ending escalator that just goes up.
8303000	8306000	You cannot see the end of it for like an hour.
8306000	8309000	I refuse to believe anything is worse than the Philadelphia airport.
8309000	8311000	Thankfully, I've not done the Philadelphia airport.
8311000	8312000	It's pretty bad.
8312000	8316000	But I still think to this day my favorite airport for layout would have to be Burbank.
8316000	8317000	Oh, I love Burbank.
8317000	8318000	Burbank is so easy.
8318000	8320000	Burbank, yeah. That's what I always call it.
8320000	8325000	Or believe it or not, Dallas Fort Worth is actually a really well laid out airport.
8325000	8328000	And you can get rides on the little golf carts.
8328000	8330000	Like, let's talk about airports.
8330000	8331000	All right.
8331000	8333000	OK. And then my last one.
8333000	8336000	Now, like I use this with a disclaimer.
8336000	8337000	I love my kitten.
8337000	8339000	My baby is so sweet.
8339000	8344000	But she had claws on her and clawed the crap out of my leg.
8344000	8346000	She was pouncing my feet like I'd walk by pounce.
8346000	8349000	And then she decided that she was going to call up my calf.
8349000	8351000	So finally we sat her down.
8351000	8356000	And then she, you know, Dan's holding her and I'm trying to clip her little claws.
8356000	8358000	And she's wiggling and moving her paws out of the way.
8358000	8361000	And making the most god awful noise.
8361000	8362000	It was like this.
8362000	8365000	Oh, lordy.
8365000	8366000	Yeah, that noise.
8366000	8368000	And I'm like, Mimi.
8368000	8369000	And then she runs off.
8369000	8371000	And the first thing, you know what she does once I'm done with her?
8371000	8373000	The first thing she does is goes into her room,
8373000	8375000	looks at her bolt and says, you're giving me a treat woman.
8376000	8378000	So I did.
8378000	8379000	All right.
8379000	8381000	Uh, Loki.
8381000	8385000	Uh, I guess, uh, F.U. to be called.
8385000	8387000	For not getting orders correct.
8387000	8388000	Fair enough.
8388000	8389000	Is that it?
8389000	8390000	All right.
8390000	8395000	My F.U. of the week goes to the scale for telling me the truth.
8395000	8399000	Next time lie to me and make me feel better about myself, asshole.
8399000	8400000	All right.
8400000	8402000	Let's get to a couple more news stories.
8402000	8403000	And then we're going to open up the Skype line.
8403000	8404000	But first, Loki.
8404000	8406000	So he has gotten some more funding,
8406000	8411000	not necessarily from Kickstarter, but from some outside investors,
8411000	8414000	including Nvidia, actually.
8414000	8419000	Nvidia is investing money in the as well as the Mayfield Fund,
8419000	8424000	Shasta Ventures and OCam Partners, who I have no fucking clue who they are.
8424000	8426000	But, um, yeah.
8426000	8430000	So they've got another 15 million dollars, which will help them launch retail.
8430000	8436000	Speaking of which, their retail launch, as I expected, was delayed to June 25th,
8436000	8441000	as opposed to June 4th, because there's no fucking way they would ever hit that target
8441000	8444000	with how fast they're shipping, you know, the Kickstarter backers.
8444000	8448000	And on top of that, the people that preordered on Ouya.tv.
8448000	8457000	And they say they have 12,000 developers who registered to make an Ouya game.
8457000	8459000	So that's not necessarily 12,000 games that are out there,
8459000	8464000	but 12,000 people that are, yeah, possibly going to make a game.
8464000	8468000	So, I don't know.
8468000	8472000	They claim they're ahead of schedule, but I don't buy it.
8472000	8474000	How much did you play your Ouya this week?
8474000	8475000	Uh, for a little bit.
8475000	8478000	I don't remember how long it was, though, but I checked out.
8478000	8479000	What did I check out this week?
8479000	8482000	I downloaded this frog game that's supposed to be pretty fun.
8483000	8491000	I played more of the Pingu puzzle poker, which I may be writing a review on that at some point.
8491000	8494000	I don't know. I don't want to yet, because it's still, like, beta.
8494000	8498000	It's not the finished game, so, you know, you don't want to do that.
8501000	8503000	I know I played some of that. I just downloaded some more stuff.
8503000	8505000	I don't really remember playing any of the games.
8505000	8509000	There's a few I tried that were kind of lame, but I don't remember exactly where they were.
8510000	8512000	Still haven't played Final Fantasy III.
8512000	8513000	That's alright.
8513000	8517000	Anyhow, moving on to one more story tonight.
8517000	8522000	This is about a comment from Bobby Kotick, who is the CEO of Activision.
8522000	8530000	Saying in an earnings call this week, where they were talking about the loss of WoW subscribers and so forth,
8530000	8534000	but this isn't about PC stuff or WoW, this is about console.
8534000	8540000	This is about the new consoles, Xbox, Lube, Infinity, 720, whatever you want to call it.
8540000	8541000	Lubefinity.
8541000	8543000	Lubefinity, and the PlayStation 4.
8543000	8549000	Quote, there are still many unknown factors such as pricing, launch dates, and quantities, the level of first party support,
8549000	8556000	and, importantly, consumer purchase intent in a world where consoles are no longer just competing with each other,
8556000	8560000	but also with new platforms such as smartphones and tablets.
8560000	8563000	He also went on to say that Wii U had a, quote, very slow start,
8563000	8570000	and uncertainties in the next year could impact the performance of Activision overall.
8570000	8574000	So, so far no Call of Duty ghosts on Wii U either.
8574000	8575000	Well, yeah.
8575000	8580000	So, and I think, yeah, it's a very big possibility.
8580000	8586000	I think, though, it's less going to be, oh, I have a smartphone tablet I can play with these games on here,
8586000	8588000	which no one's actually thinking that.
8588000	8595000	But I think it's more of why do I need to buy a next gen console because Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out right then,
8595000	8599000	or, hey, I want to play Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty ghosts.
8599000	8603000	Hey, guess what? Those are both on current gen consoles or Assassin's Creed, you know, Black Flag.
8603000	8607000	Oh, current gen consoles, you know, or Watch Dogs, current gen as well.
8607000	8610000	So it's like why do I need to buy a new console for these?
8610000	8615000	And they're going to have to figure out this whole what am I going to do with another console, you know,
8615000	8617000	when I want to play all the old games and they're not backwards compatible.
8617000	8621000	They showed footage of Black Flag on the PlayStation 4.
8621000	8623000	You can't tell the difference.
8623000	8628000	You can't tell the difference between the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 version of that game.
8628000	8636000	I'm sure it's other like simulation like physics stuff in there, but I all know.
8636000	8638000	I can't really tell much of a difference.
8638000	8643000	I lost my train of thought.
8643000	8646000	Maybe first party games. I don't know.
8646000	8650000	You know, that might help because, I mean, they're going to have some exclusive first party stuff,
8650000	8653000	but that's what once again, it kind of sells systems.
8653000	8655000	I remembered what I was going to say.
8655000	8660000	There's rumors about this new Xbox, whatever it's called, that there's an HDMI pass through port on it.
8660000	8666000	Have you heard about this where, you know, you'll be able to save an HDMI thing because you can use the pass through port.
8666000	8669000	Wouldn't it be funny if that only worked with a 360?
8669000	8671000	Because they could do that, right?
8671000	8675000	They could say, yeah, it's got an HDMI pass through port, but it will only work with the 360.
8675000	8677000	It's an encrypted port or whatever.
8677000	8682000	And a patch on the 360 will make it so that this is how we're going to solve the issue of backwards compatibility.
8682000	8686000	You can patch your 360 through to expand the unit, but it only works.
8686000	8689000	It won't, like you can't use the PlayStation 3.
8689000	8692000	You can only use 360. Wouldn't that be funny?
8692000	8695000	Of course, they wouldn't necessarily openly say that.
8695000	8699000	Of course, they wouldn't necessarily openly say that, but...
8699000	8701000	I don't think they could even...
8701000	8706000	They don't do that. In fact, actually, they don't really have an encrypted HDMI.
8706000	8708000	It's PlayStation 3 that does.
8708000	8714000	In fact, if you try to do video capture through HDMI, you can't do that on the PlayStation 3.
8714000	8716000	You can only do that on the 360.
8716000	8719000	And I think you might be able to do it on the PlayStation 3 up to a certain...
8719000	8724000	Maybe not 1080p, but I know you can't do 1080p through HDMI on the PS3.
8724000	8726000	I don't see them doing that.
8726000	8732000	It's still going to be very awkward with another console sitting next to your console to do backwards compatibility.
8732000	8734000	Just don't worry about it and just say, you know what?
8734000	8736000	We're going to drop the price of the 360.
8736000	8738000	You have a 360. You don't need to sell it.
8738000	8742000	You can just hold onto it and play your games on that.
8742000	8744000	I don't really know.
8744000	8746000	I'm sure they'll have a solution for it at some point.
8746000	8750000	I don't see it as that big a deal because I'm not really going to get rid of my 360.
8750000	8753000	I'll just have another console.
8754000	8757000	mm2k in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
8757000	8759000	I think next gen's coming out a year too early.
8759000	8761000	You know, I'm starting to think so too.
8761000	8767000	When these systems first came out, they started talking about this whole 10 year cycle.
8767000	8770000	I kind of think maybe it's too early.
8770000	8772000	It might be.
8772000	8779000	We may have a Wii U situation where it's just, hey, there's the launch titles and not a whole ton.
8779000	8781000	I still think we're going to see some more.
8781000	8785000	I think we're going to see more third party games, but I think it's going to be a lot of this.
8785000	8792000	It's on PS4 and it's on PS3 because they're worried that, oh, we may not make up the sales on just a PlayStation 4 exclusive game.
8792000	8795000	I think that's going to be a real big issue.
8795000	8802000	You're going to say, well, especially if like if the Assassin's Creed thing, I mean, I'm sure it looks similar to the PC version.
8802000	8808000	Probably exactly like the PC version, but I haven't seen the PS3 version running next to the PS4 version.
8808000	8812000	So I can't say that it's like night and day, but it doesn't look from what they showed.
8812000	8815000	It doesn't look night and day based off the trailers.
8815000	8819000	It looks exactly the same. But I mean, I think the trailers are captured off of the PC.
8819000	8821000	So, you know, that's not surprise there.
8821000	8824000	All right. Well, let's open up the Skype line, guys.
8824000	8828000	It's the last we have on our list for the show tonight.
8828000	8830000	But what do you guys want to talk about?
8830000	8835000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8836000	8841000	I just got an email on my little emails from Joe from earlier in the show thanking us for having him on.
8841000	8844000	So that was a fun interview.
8844000	8851000	If you missed the interview earlier, be sure to download it on the podcast feed or check it out on a streaming solution like Stitcher or TuneIn.
8851000	8853000	One of your favorite apps there.
8853000	8862000	Again, 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call and say hello and talk about whatever's going on in your mind this week.
8863000	8867000	All right. Let's go to the phones. Hi. Here on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8867000	8868000	Hi. Joe Zaku here.
8868000	8869000	Hey, Zaku.
8869000	8870000	Hi.
8870000	8871000	We see you.
8871000	8872000	How's everything going?
8872000	8874000	Good. Good.
8874000	8877000	Now we see you in studio. It's like you're here. What's up?
8877000	8885000	Nothing much. Just catching up on some post Mother's Day gaming.
8885000	8890000	Dug up my old PS2 to play some San Andreas after like a three year hiatus.
8890000	8894000	Some classics. You know, my Grand Theft Auto 4 is still in the string crap.
8894000	8896000	I can't believe you just called that a classic, Rob.
8896000	8897000	It is, isn't it?
8897000	8899000	Have you not played Grand Theft Auto 4?
8899000	8904000	Don't say you're old. I mean, you're talking about like a game that's almost a decade old. That's kind of classic.
8904000	8905000	Wait, what?
8905000	8909000	Even like three and five city are pretty much classic at this point.
8909000	8913000	Dude, you haven't played Grand Theft Auto 4. Go play Grand Theft Auto 4.
8914000	8921000	No, wait. I think I did a little bit. I don't remember. If I did, it was a long time ago when I first came out to play that.
8921000	8923000	Well, that one's playing.
8923000	8930000	At the very least, if you're going to participate in the VOG gaming this week, you do need to play past the first few missions, I think, in order to get the multiplayer options.
8930000	8931000	I don't figure it out.
8931000	8938000	I got really far in GTA 4 and then I lost my 360 copy, so now I have to start again for my piece, the one that I have on Steam.
8938000	8942000	Wouldn't it be funny though, Loki, if I started playing and I got totally addicted to it?
8942000	8944000	It's awesome. It seriously is.
8944000	8948000	I do like hoes. I hear there's lots of hoes in Grand Theft Auto 4.
8948000	8950000	No, no, no, Rob, you like ho-hoes. Those are different.
8950000	8952000	Hey, you're calling me fat.
8954000	8957000	Sorry, Zaku. So you're playing San Andreas.
8958000	8965000	Yeah, just catching up on that and basically trying to juggle my queue, but I digress.
8965000	8981000	I guess part of what I wanted to bring up was the fact that the whole next-gen issues with some of the folks who are a part of it, like Nintendo basically,
8981000	8992000	bet the whole barn on the Wii U, and so far it's like EA's pushing back, Activision may, as you've already stated, maybe on its way out.
8992000	9005000	So it pretty much goes to the point where did Nintendo intend for this to be a Hail Mary because they were getting outgunned by the fact that the Wii was so far behind its current gen?
9006000	9010000	Yes, but there's a part of me that wonders if it's not a bridge console.
9010000	9018000	And I threw that idea out because they invested so much in this gamepad and it wasn't just like the same type of stuff you saw on the Wii.
9018000	9027000	I think if we had just seen literally a quote-unquote super Wii, it would have been more of a bridge console, which is what I honestly thought we were going to get.
9027000	9035000	And then when we got the gamepad, I was like, oh, maybe not. But now I'm starting to wonder again, whether intended or not, Nintendo may have to.
9035000	9041000	And I still think it's too early to say. I still think it's way too early to say, we don't know what this holiday is going to really look like.
9041000	9051000	Nintendo could put out those must-have games and sell fuck-tons of those consoles, and you may see new Xbox and PlayStation in hot water because they don't quite have that same thing.
9051000	9053000	I don't know. It's too early to say.
9053000	9065000	On the other hand, you know, the word on the street is that Microsoft actually at the last minute, it looks like they're going to ditch the whole always online requirement.
9065000	9069000	Funny how that happened.
9069000	9085000	It works in their favor in the sense that Sony basically was forced to, you know, since the fact that they went early, it makes it easier due to the fact that you spread all these rumors around,
9085000	9094000	and then you create this atmosphere where, oh, we're not going to go through our competition console because such and such always requires Y.
9094000	9105000	And then all of a sudden, they could just go in at the very last minute and announce, you know, all the things, pretty much dispel every rumor that's been going on for almost the past year,
9105000	9110000	and they could pretty much be on par, if not slightly above, going into E3.
9110000	9113000	They could do that, but they probably won't.
9113000	9120000	On the other hand, think about it. I mean, from what I'm hearing, it's pretty much the same, almost the same console.
9120000	9127000	They're all going to be running Blu-rays. They're all going to have 8 gigs of RAM, although one of them may require more things than others.
9127000	9141000	But if the rumors end up becoming true where they, like, ditch online, then that might just bring around some of the folks who are on the fence who pretty much didn't abandon Sony.
9141000	9154000	But at the same time, they pretty much had the thoughts that, you know, if they had to go on and defend this lipstick on a pig by, you know, making sure, by defending always online, then, yeah, it would have been swayed to Sony.
9154000	9165000	But, you know, if by E3, Microsoft basically, you know, pulls what they have to, and they could pretty much be neck and neck.
9165000	9181000	It's almost like an election where, you know, you try to blackball the other guy, you try to throw mud, and then all of a sudden, you dispel rumors, and then you do something, you do an event where you're pretty much, you're pretty much even in the polls.
9181000	9186000	That's how I think of it. Like, the way I see it in certain elections where...
9186000	9191000	So wait, you think Nintendo or Sony started that rumor about Microsoft always being online?
9191000	9202000	I'm thinking it's Microsoft themselves. I mean, this is coming from their developer, not only, like, you know, third-party devs that managed to get their hands on the early dev kits.
9202000	9212000	And especially that guy, that product manager that, you know, opened his mouth on Twitter, that didn't help.
9212000	9230000	Zaku, here's the thing about Nintendo, Zaku, I am not willing to write them off yet until, because if they price drop at E3, the game is afoot again. It's a whole new game, level 2, you know, it's 3DS all over again if they price drop at E3, which is highly likely, I think.
9231000	9238000	But at the same time, it's starting to shape up like a two-horse race at this point, with Microsoft and Sony.
9238000	9243000	And the fact that, you know, Microsoft has to, like, improve their quote-unquote phone numbers.
9243000	9253000	Will it, though? Will it be a two-horse race? Because now we're seeing that, you know, people might just keep what they got to play Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty Ghosts and all these other games.
9253000	9257000	True, but two-horse race in the sense of the next generation.
9258000	9260000	Alright.
9260000	9266000	That's all it is. It's just like, you're right, there is an argument to be made to keep what you currently have in this generation.
9266000	9273000	Hell, I'm not even, like, almost half a year into my PS3 right there that my girl got me this past Christmas.
9273000	9283000	So, you know, it's still fresh to me, knowing the fact that I had, like, my other platforms to juggle before the PS3.
9283000	9291000	So, I'm still chewing on that. So, may I get, you know, will I be getting one of those new consoles? Not likely. Not yet.
9291000	9294000	Usually, I just wait a while.
9294000	9297000	I will, most likely, because I'm a consumer whore.
9297000	9300000	Going into this next gen, it might be a two-horse race.
9300000	9305000	Alright, well, we will see. Let's have this conversation again after E3 and see what happens.
9305000	9306000	Speculation right now.
9306000	9309000	Alright. Alright, Zaku, I'm gonna let you go to get more calls. Take care, buddy.
9309000	9310000	Bye.
9310000	9311000	Bye.
9311000	9316000	Alright. I think, you know, he's right. It's all speculation right now. At least that part he's right.
9316000	9319000	It's all speculation right now. It's way too early to say.
9319000	9327000	Talk to us after May 21st. In fact, I think, wasn't that the Memorial Day weekend where we were thinking about not having a show?
9327000	9329000	That's, yeah, that's when I'm gone.
9329000	9333000	You're not gonna be here. I don't know. We might have to do something something that week.
9333000	9334000	I'll be here.
9334000	9335000	It's not that night you'll be here.
9335000	9338000	We might have to do something because that's right after the Xbox announcement.
9338000	9342000	We got to talk about something. Even if Dark Soccer can't be here that night.
9342000	9344000	She doesn't care about Xbox anyway, right?
9344000	9345000	X what?
9345000	9348000	Yeah, exactly. Hi on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9348000	9350000	Rob, it's a trumpet.
9350000	9355000	Oh my God. Bobby's on webcam and he's actually got his cartridge. That's awesome.
9355000	9357000	It's a trumpet, Rob.
9359000	9361000	Happy Mother's Day to you too, Mom.
9361000	9362000	Happy Mother's Day.
9363000	9365000	What's on your mind, Bobby?
9365000	9367000	I just want to tell you it was a trumpet.
9368000	9370000	I thought it was a drumstick with you.
9371000	9374000	Well, that one, there's no drumsticks in anticipation. It's a trumpet.
9374000	9377000	I think there was a drum. If I removed...
9377000	9379000	No, because I would have played as the drum.
9379000	9383000	No, no, no. Not the piece. The little drawings. Let me do a little drawing. Alright, alright.
9383000	9388000	And when you put that game up to very hard, it's like, it would like draw one line and the computer would come in and be like,
9388000	9392000	Oh, it's an elephant. How did you know it was an elephant?
9394000	9396000	Because the computer always cheats.
9396000	9400000	Yes, so I always played on very easy and I whooped the computer's ass and I felt better about myself.
9400000	9405000	And that's what it's about. It's about knowing that you kicked that ice cream cone into oblivion.
9405000	9406000	That's right.
9406000	9407000	That's right.
9407000	9411000	Bobby, I do wish you a happy anniversary of your hatching.
9411000	9412000	Thank you.
9412000	9416000	Ah, yes. I hope you heard the birthday embarrassment at the beginning of the show.
9416000	9417000	I did.
9417000	9420000	I neglected to say it on your show tonight like a fool.
9420000	9423000	That's right. I was hoping you would forget.
9424000	9427000	Your discretion was appreciated.
9427000	9433000	I was too hypnotized by the music of Professor Shy Guy who was fun on your show.
9433000	9435000	It's been Kickstarter night on VOG tonight.
9435000	9436000	Yes.
9436000	9439000	So, yeah, everybody check that out because of that.
9439000	9442000	He's a great guy. I've actually seen him perform before.
9442000	9446000	And he was the person playing when GLaDOS made me get on the dance floor.
9446000	9448000	Oh, okay. I remember that story.
9448000	9455000	Oh, and now that all ties together because I know he was talking about Ella McLean, who is a confirmed guest of GamerX.
9455000	9460000	So maybe I will finally get to meet her in August at that whole thing. I'm excited about that.
9460000	9463000	And then you can name drop me and she'll be like, oh, yeah, I remember him.
9463000	9467000	I will absolutely name drop you. I'll be like, yeah, we're on the same network. Yeah, good times.
9467000	9471000	And then we may get Professor Shy Guy at Dragon Con.
9471000	9472000	Awesome.
9472000	9473000	Or our thing.
9473000	9479000	I know we've got a lot of conventions coming up. Are you getting excited about E3 only a few weeks away?
9479000	9480000	Not yet.
9480000	9481000	Not yet?
9481000	9482000	Not yet. It takes a while.
9482000	9487000	It's like right before anything because right now it's like I'm getting all the invites to things.
9487000	9491000	So it's like now I'm trying to figure out what I want to schedule and what I don't want to schedule.
9491000	9494000	And so, yeah, I'm playing all that game right now.
9494000	9498000	I'm still waiting to hear back from the E3 Pope, but that's my own fault for waiting so long to do it.
9498000	9501000	But, you know, it is what it is. But at least we're going to Disneyland.
9501000	9506000	Yes. Yes. I've already got my plane tickets and we'll be going. Anybody else going to join us on that?
9506000	9511000	It might just be me. I don't know. I would love to drag Dark Sakura, but I don't know if she's going to be game. We'll see.
9511000	9515000	I will always go to Disneyland when I can, but I am the unemployed.
9515000	9520000	Here's the thing. It also depends on if I get blessed by the E3 Pope or not.
9520000	9523000	If I do, then it will definitely only be you and me.
9523000	9529000	But if I don't, then that opens up the opportunity that I can be like, hey, you don't have to sit around while I'm at a convention center all day.
9529000	9535000	Let's go to Disneyland for a day or two. So, we'll find out that answer this week.
9535000	9538000	It better be this week. So, we'll see.
9538000	9540000	So, I just wanted to tell you that it was a trumpet.
9540000	9544000	Plug Professor Shy Guy's Kickstarter as well as the Zelda movie Kickstarter.
9544000	9549000	Because I actually, the thing about with Joe, and I'm not going to give details or anything,
9549000	9552000	I actually do know what he's going to be doing with the movie.
9552000	9561000	I know the narrative and it's really an interesting take on documentaries is what he's doing.
9561000	9566000	He told me that and then he later specifically said, don't tell people that yet.
9566000	9569000	Let that be a surprise. And I almost spilled the beans at one point.
9569000	9572000	So, that's why I backed it.
9572000	9575000	So, I actually have put my money where my mouth is if it gets backed.
9575000	9577000	I think other people should back it.
9577000	9582000	He's coming back up to Atlanta and I'm going to go down there and be a part of the filming there.
9582000	9586000	Well, apparently he loves Sacramento, so he can come back on the show when he comes in person.
9586000	9592000	Yeah, and I think he is coming. Like he said, Sacramento is one of the places that he may be traveling to.
9592000	9594000	I will have to go check it out.
9594000	9597000	What the hell goes on here? Maybe SacAnime is getting huge out here.
9597000	9603000	Actually, SacAnime has been growing and there's another convention that started up, I want to say in Rockland.
9603000	9605000	Yeah, so who knows?
9605000	9612000	He's actually visiting actual people that did things. The reason he came up to Atlanta is because The Hero of Time was filmed here.
9612000	9614000	Oh, okay.
9614000	9619000	Those creators were here and there were a couple other people that were big in the Zelda community that, listening to his interview,
9619000	9624000	he may have actually had to drop their involvement for legal reasons, but they were here in Atlanta.
9624000	9632000	So, when he came into Atlanta, he actually was here to talk to three different Zelda fan groups that were all based in Atlanta.
9632000	9638000	And he's coming back because the Symphony of the Goddesses is performing in Atlanta and he's going to do some follow-up stuff with them
9638000	9642000	and do some more follow-up stuff with some of the other Atlanta people as well.
9642000	9647000	So, he's kind of more meeting the people rather than really going to conventions.
9647000	9651000	He's just now starting to go to conventions, but he also might be at DragonCon as well.
9651000	9654000	Sure. Makes sense. Makes sense. Alright.
9654000	9658000	Well, Bobby, anything else you want to plug or talk about while you're here?
9658000	9663000	No. You guys may want to tune in June 2nd during our shows.
9663000	9666000	For a little something something.
9666000	9667000	Dot dot dot.
9667000	9669000	Dot dot dot. Exactly. To be continued.
9669000	9670000	To be continued.
9670000	9673000	What would June 2nd mark the one year anniversary of? I'm trying to think.
9673000	9674000	I don't know.
9674000	9677000	I don't know. Alright. Alright, Bobby. Always a pleasure to talk to you.
9677000	9679000	June 2nd, 2012?
9679000	9680000	Yeah.
9680000	9683000	Maybe the one year anniversary of that. That day is...
9683000	9687000	Oh, shut up, Logie. Alright. I'm going to let you go, Bobby. Take care.
9687000	9690000	Alright. Bye. Always a pleasure to talk to Bobby Blackwolf.
9690000	9693000	He's always good enough to have us on his show every week.
9693000	9695000	So, it's always nice when we can return the favor.
9695000	9699000	1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.
9699000	9703000	I want to do Twitter topics, too. I'm like, where's my iPad? Where's my iPad?
9703000	9707000	Oh, it's in the iCades. Let me just get that out of there.
9707000	9710000	You know what? You don't even have to lift that thing to get it out.
9710000	9712000	Oh, I always do.
9712000	9715000	Yeah. I've...fingers.
9715000	9717000	You're saying I should just finger it a little bit?
9717000	9719000	Yeah, you need to finger it, Rob.
9719000	9722000	Alright. I will. I'll finger it next time.
9722000	9726000	Alright, before we get to last minute stories with Logie, let's try to take at least one more call here tonight.
9726000	9728000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9728000	9730000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
9730000	9732000	Hi, Akdeft. How you doing?
9732000	9734000	Really fine. And you?
9734000	9736000	Good. What's on your mind tonight?
9736000	9741000	Well, I wanted to just say that I backed up the Zelda Kickstarter.
9741000	9746000	Oh, hey. Hey, I'm glad to hear our show is helping and that it actually does help spread the word.
9746000	9749000	What made you decide to pitch in and help?
9749000	9758000	Well, I already had read Bobby's article on VOG, so I pretty much had the intention of doing so.
9759000	9769000	But while you're interviewing the guy, John, I think, he pretty much has a great idea here.
9769000	9780000	His project seems like a really, really interesting thing to do, especially for something that many people like, like Zelda.
9781000	9793000	And something that he probably mentioned that really strikes me really good is that, for example, you're here because of video games.
9793000	9805000	And one of them was Zelda. And you were inspired by video games to do your show, not to mention Bobby and many other shows on VOG and other podcasts out there.
9805000	9806000	That is very true.
9806000	9815000	It doesn't mention me that I do the I Love That Song articles on VOG. Video games and video game music inspired me to do that.
9815000	9828000	So, yeah, I do have Zelda in part to think of that. So, I really want to see more of the fans rather than just the history of Zelda and its creation.
9828000	9834000	I want to see how people were affected by this game.
9834000	9841000	Now, of course, in some ways, I think this particular show, you would have to credit Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania a little more so.
9841000	9849000	But, I mean, the honest reality is, would I have ever played those games or been into gaming at the first place if it wasn't for the great classic 8-bit games that kind of paved the way?
9849000	9852000	I don't know. And certainly, Zelda played an influence in that.
9852000	9859000	So, it's, you know, it's, I like to answer that question a lot, too. It kind of made me go, oh, yeah, it's true.
9859000	9865000	You know, there is a lot of inspiration for what I'm doing every Sunday night that comes from games like Zelda and so forth.
9865000	9871000	Yeah, and I really want to see this project finished or at least backed up.
9871000	9893000	Though it has a long way to go, but I think that if people understand what the meaning of this project is and not necessarily think, oh, it's going to be about Zelda and, oh, my God, they're going to prop it up, Nintendo, and do something wrong with it.
9893000	9899000	Or maybe the instant assumption that it's going to get shut down is a little bit silly, too.
9899000	9903000	I mean, if it was going to get instantly shut down, I think it would have been already.
9903000	9908000	And I think, again, you know, you look at something like King of Kong, Donkey Kong was a Nintendo game, too.
9908000	9911000	And it happened. So, you know, there's ways he can do it.
9911000	9920000	And he sounds like he's got his, what did he say, he's dotting his lowercase J's or whatever he said that, you know, he's got it explored with the legal team and so forth.
9920000	9924000	He's ready to fight for his movie if he has to a little bit.
9924000	9930000	Yeah, I don't think he has any legal problems at least because of the material.
9930000	9942000	So it isn't like he's taking explicit, sorry, Nintendo property to, for profit or something like that.
9942000	9947000	So I think he's going to be fine in that sense.
9947000	9951000	The fans, that's what I'm worried about.
9951000	9962000	But like I said, if they understand the meaning behind this project and understand what it is exactly, I think that it will get a higher response.
9962000	9967000	Well, you know, that's part of the reason why we had him on the show tonight to kind of get people talking and more people looking.
9967000	9974000	And, you know, maybe even if just a couple folks friend the thing on Facebook and then share it with their friends,
9974000	9980000	that's going to be exposure to possibly, you know, thousands more people that didn't see it before, possibly.
9980000	9984000	So a lot of it is about getting the word out. So we'll see what happens.
9984000	9988000	But I do plan on backing it myself, that and the Professor Shy Guy one.
9988000	9992000	I'll give him some money too. I think that was pretty cool. So, all right.
9992000	9997000	Yeah, that project too seems pretty good to back up to.
9997000	10000000	All right. Well, Akdeft, any other quick thoughts before I let you go?
10000000	10006000	Nothing more. I sent you a Twitter topic. I don't know if you read it already.
10006000	10010000	I am looking at it right now. But since you brought it up, I'll go ahead and talk about it with you here.
10010000	10014000	Let's see. You tweeted us and it says Skullgirls items for Team Fortress 2.
10014000	10019000	They are up on the Steam Workshop for fans to vote and approve so they can be pre-order items.
10019000	10021000	So what sort of items do we have to look forward to?
10021000	10026000	They're basically hats and you know what, for TF2.
10026000	10027000	Of course.
10027000	10030000	They're pretty cool. They're pretty well designed.
10030000	10033000	It wouldn't be Team Fortress if they weren't hats.
10033000	10044000	These items actually were rewards for the indiegogo they had for the DLC characters and the PC version.
10044000	10054000	But Valve said to them that they had to approve first of the items and then see if they can release them as pre-order incentives.
10054000	10068000	Though now they have not a green light, but basically that fans have to approve of the items so they can be put as incentives of pre-orders.
10068000	10074000	And also the backers of the project up there.
10074000	10080000	Alright. Well, check that out on the Steam store in the community section.
10080000	10084000	And lots of cool add-ons for games out there. I really love how Steam has been expanding that.
10084000	10088000	You know I love me some Mass Effect Civs in Civ 5.
10088000	10092000	Alright. Well, Act F, I'm going to let you go so I can get these other Twitter topics and wrap up the show.
10092000	10093000	But have a good one, buddy. Okay?
10093000	10094000	You too. Thanks.
10094000	10095000	Alright. Bye.
10095000	10098000	Alright. I'm going to close up the Skype line for now.
10098000	10101000	Sorry if you didn't get through tonight, but remember you can always email us.
10101000	10103000	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
10103000	10107000	Or you can tweet us and I'll get to last minute stories here in a minute, Loki.
10107000	10109000	But first, I thought I'd quickly go through these Twitter topics.
10109000	10116000	sj100matt tweeted us about ESPN ranked the best sports video games of all time.
10116000	10118000	Here are the top five.
10118000	10121000	WWF No Mercy, number five.
10121000	10124000	MVP Baseball, 2005, number four.
10124000	10127000	Mike Tyson's Punch Out, number three.
10127000	10128000	Yeah.
10128000	10131000	NHL 94, number two. Yeah, that's a pretty good one.
10131000	10134000	Tecmo Super Bowl, number one.
10134000	10135000	Clearly.
10135000	10136000	Yeah.
10136000	10138000	Clearly. I mean, you can't argue with that.
10138000	10141000	You know what? I still like Super High Impact.
10141000	10146000	Also, this list is badly needed. Now, I don't see if there was maybe a six through ten.
10146000	10148000	There are no Blades of Steel.
10148000	10149000	Blades of Steel is not here.
10149000	10150000	Yeah.
10150000	10153000	And NBA Jam, which I think would have been a worthy addition, is not here.
10153000	10156000	Depending on the version of NBA Jam, because there are some shitty versions.
10156000	10158000	Yeah, not the new one. Not the new one.
10158000	10163000	Well, if you want like the hardest home version ever, you want to look for the PlayStation Tournament Edition.
10163000	10167000	How much is the original arcade version? That's the one I would do.
10167000	10172000	So, okay. Very interesting. But I'm okay with Tecmo Super Bowl being number one.
10172000	10180000	Even though I don't play a lot of sports video games, I think it says a lot that I think I have played at least three if not four of the games on that list.
10180000	10183000	So, I think that says a lot as to why they are the top five.
10183000	10188000	Some other tweets here from Tigerclaw. Defiance, the TV show.
10188000	10191000	Tigerclaw tweets us saying Defiance was renewed for a second season.
10191000	10194000	That shocked the hell out of me because this is a sci-fi show, isn't it?
10194000	10195000	Yeah.
10195000	10200000	I actually downloaded the first four episodes to watch. I haven't watched them yet because shit's been happening.
10200000	10202000	I think quite a few people have been watching it.
10202000	10204000	Yeah, I hear a lot of people talking about it.
10204000	10209000	I did read over the Wikipedia article on it and it actually seemed really interesting.
10209000	10215000	I watched on Netflix three episodes of Scandal last night, which has nothing to do with sci-fi.
10215000	10220000	But I bet Nellie would watch Scandal because it's by the chick who does Grey's Anatomy, which I'm almost embarrassed to say I watched it.
10220000	10222000	But it's pretty good.
10223000	10224000	Yeah.
10224000	10226000	It's pretty good. It's pretty good, Loki. Scandal's pretty good.
10226000	10229000	I still want to know what the thing is with Nellie and her Tyra Banks obsession.
10229000	10233000	It's not all the crappy McSteamy stuff from Grey's Anatomy, though.
10233000	10235000	This is about, you know, this...
10235000	10237000	She's on the last season of Grey's Anatomy.
10237000	10238000	Is she? Oh, is she?
10238000	10241000	She's finishing up, yeah, the last season. Or this season.
10241000	10243000	Oh, this season is the last season.
10243000	10245000	Yeah, the last season she can watch.
10245000	10250000	One more tweet from Tigerclaw and this is about a Capcom promotion for Resident Evil.
10250000	10253000	Filling a pool with blood and gore.
10253000	10256000	Well, you know this came from the UK marketing department.
10256000	10260000	It was the first blood-filled swimming pool.
10260000	10267000	Good lord. It's going to have 55,000 gallons of water, and I'm using the little quotey fingers, featuring...
10267000	10269000	With corn syrup and red food coloring?
10269000	10277000	I'm sure. Fake human torsos as flotation devices, intestines as lane markers, and all kinds of gruesome objects floating in the water.
10278000	10283000	The event is near London's Olympic Stadium, but not actually there. That would be weird.
10283000	10294000	It will be... You can get the tickets for free on Monday, May 20th, but only 200 are given out each day leading up to the pool's opening on May 25th and 26th weekend.
10294000	10297000	Memorial Day weekend, although I guess maybe that's not a thing in the UK.
10297000	10301000	If you're under 18, you need to have a parent.
10301000	10303000	Whatever. That sounds whack.
10303000	10305000	You know what?
10305000	10309000	Really, there's nothing quite like bathing in the blood of fresh virgins.
10309000	10311000	Well, now you can.
10311000	10313000	But only if it's real blood.
10313000	10320000	And it actually is really, really good softener for your skin, to say, and a facial made out of that.
10320000	10324000	That would be concerning if it was real blood. This is just stupid.
10324000	10327000	Well, the meat market thing was stupid, too.
10327000	10328000	It's just like, really?
10328000	10330000	Why is it always UK stuff?
10330000	10331000	Really?
10331000	10333000	Because if they did it over here...
10333000	10338000	I mean, no disrespect to our overseas friends, but y'all are crazy.
10338000	10342000	You know that the Scottish diet was built on a dare, right?
10342000	10348000	I bet it was Dutch influence. I bet it still had something to do with this. I'm blaming the Dutch.
10348000	10350000	I don't blame the Dutch.
10350000	10353000	I don't know, any place where, you know, blood pudding...
10353000	10356000	Where black pudding is served regularly, I don't know.
10356000	10359000	Alright, Loki, any last minute stories?
10359000	10366000	No, unfortunately I don't have any last minute stories because I'm busy cramming to write an article that will be on the website tomorrow.
10366000	10370000	And I just realized, hey, you know what, I'm not a very good writer, so...
10370000	10372000	It's challenging.
10372000	10373000	It is very challenging.
10373000	10374000	I could be your editor.
10374000	10378000	No, that's alright. We don't have time for multiple editors.
10378000	10380000	It's write and send to somebody.
10380000	10383000	I'll talk to you off air. There's always plans.
10383000	10390000	Anyhow, so if there's no last minute stories, then I guess it is time to wrap up the show, which is fine because it's about 9 o'clock anyway.
10390000	10393000	Let's go around and wrap up.
10393000	10396000	Thank you guys all for listening and tuning in tonight.
10396000	10399000	Remember, if you like the show, please help spread the word about the show.
10399000	10404000	Give us a nice five star review on iTunes or a thumbs up and support independent podcasting.
10404000	10409000	You know, there's a lot of indie broadcasters out there that work very hard at what they do and we really need your support.
10409000	10416000	Not all of us can just snap our fingers and have people pouring money onto us.
10416000	10425000	And I'm not asking for your money, but we don't have that luxury where we can do that and just have money poured onto us to buy promotion and other things for our show.
10425000	10429000	We're not afforded that luxury in the independent community, so word of mouth is so important.
10429000	10433000	So all we ask, we're not asking for your money, we're just asking for your word of mouth.
10433000	10434000	Tell a friend about the show.
10434000	10437000	Help grow our community because community is our motivator.
10437000	10440000	And the more motivation we have, the better.
10440000	10444000	Meanwhile, we'll go around and give everybody everybody's final thought.
10444000	10447000	And why don't I start with you, Loki? What's your final thought tonight?
10447000	10458000	My final thought is be sure to check out our VOG gaming night Thursdays, 8 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
10458000	10461000	I don't know if it's going to stay on that day, but maybe.
10461000	10464000	I think that's the most convenient day. It doesn't conflict with anybody else.
10464000	10468000	I know it's a little bit late on the East Coast and beyond.
10468000	10472000	But this week, Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360.
10472000	10479000	If you don't want to play that game on 360, be sure to go to our forums and let me know what game you do want to play.
10479000	10485000	And we can try to work that in because I've been asking and no one's going to say anything except for Bobby.
10485000	10489000	Which is kind of shocking to see Bobby recommend Grand Theft Auto.
10489000	10490000	But it's going to be a lot of fun.
10490000	10493000	Because he wants you to show off your elite skills. He's hoping to learn a thing or two.
10493000	10495000	I'll climb some skyscrapers.
10495000	10497000	I bet you will.
10497000	10501000	My final thought is I would like to play Where the Fuck is Jamie Now?
10501000	10503000	Oh, but she's right here at my table.
10503000	10504000	You win!
10504000	10505000	Yay!
10505000	10506000	Here, have some trail mix.
10506000	10508000	That stuff is addicting. Damn you.
10508000	10509000	I just threw it together.
10509000	10512000	Damn you, coconut. I'm trying to lose weight, not gain it.
10512000	10515000	You know what? The coconut is actually not very sweet.
10515000	10516000	And super fatty.
10516000	10518000	It's good for you. Eat it!
10518000	10521000	It's a trumpet, Jamie. It's a trumpet.
10521000	10523000	No, it's not. It's actually Reese's Pieces.
10523000	10526000	Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight.
10526000	10529000	My cat is insane and she doesn't know what is right.
10529000	10534000	No, seriously, I think that...
10534000	10538000	Is it a full moon or something? Because Midna has been completely apeshit.
10538000	10540000	I have no idea.
10540000	10543000	But I'm probably going to go home and get pounced again.
10543000	10545000	So, who knows what's going to happen.
10546000	10553000	Also, I am doing a live streaming Mass Effect 3 with my really shitty but sometimes funny commentary.
10553000	10559000	From 5 to 8 Pacific time on my Twitch TV channel.
10559000	10563000	I need to do some streaming. I feel left out. Maybe I'll stream tonight.
10563000	10567000	You know what? We should do a post-Hoard House multiplayer.
10567000	10568000	That is...
10568000	10569000	I will drink.
10569000	10570000	That is probably a possibility.
10570000	10573000	We should make Shane drink and I'll drink and we'll both be dunk.
10574000	10579000	I don't think Shane is going to drink for another 5 years after what happened the other night.
10579000	10585000	Sadly, I think the archive video has probably already gone off Twitch TV and we didn't export any of it.
10585000	10587000	But it was good times.
10587000	10590000	Alright, that's it guys. We're going to close up shop and get out of here tonight.
10590000	10592000	Thanks again for tuning in and supporting us.
10592000	10596000	We will be back next week. Next week is the 19th.
10596000	10598000	We will all be here next week for another show.
10598000	10602000	We will see you then live or in podcast form.
10602000	10604000	Either way, you chose to support us this week.
10604000	10605000	Thank you for listening.
10605000	10606000	Have a wonderful night everybody!
10632000	10634000	See you next week!
10662000	10664000	Thanks for watching!
