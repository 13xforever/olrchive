10082	24535	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, May 12, 2013, Sony makes moves to grab more indies, XSEED and Atlas combined, and we talked to John G., the creator of the Zelda documentary, It's Dangerous to Go Alone.
31690	36954	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37034	45299	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May the 12th of 2013, episode number 504 of our show.
45720	53945	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and all things gaming and so forth, culture, blah blah blah, lols.

58612	63256	Blar Blar Blar What happened?
63276	64677	Did you eat at Panda Express again?
64898	84635	No, I have my own delicious food, but this week's been shitty Well, that's why you're gonna lose yourself in a super fun chipper episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight I would try, but if I may make an announcement to one of our people in chat tonight for Name and Lights We offer you our condolences It's a very difficult thing you're going through

88758	93402	And, you know, we're thinking of you guys when you guys have really horrific weeks, too.
93923	98307	But not having a bad week, I hope, is Techmaster Loki joining us as well.
99588	106093	I was having a great week up until lunch because McDonald's and I swear their quality assurance.
106353	110817	I swear their quality assurance is so bad you'd think that they were Bethesda or something.
110857	111077	Yeah.
112990	114434	Don't say funny stuff while I'm eating
121212	122793	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

197983	199084	Facebook, yes.
199484	200224	Is it the bouncing ball?
200324	201324	I haven't done that in a long time.
201404	207126	No, it just, it prints happy birthday 29 times and then says, sorry, this program will only count to 29.
207887	207987	Oh.
208587	210588	There you go.
212128	213469	I need to do more programming.
213509	216309	I haven't done a lot of that in a long, long, long time.
217370	217530	So.
217890	219771	But I'm too busy doing a radio show, what can I say?
220071	246929	So anyway, happy birthday to Bobby Blackwolf Also, happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there Whether that be, you know, having kids, having pets Kitty moms, kitty moms Mother figures, Mr. Moms, you know, whatever Grandmoms, moms-to-be, all those things Happy Mother's Day to all of you And hope you forgot, or hope you forgot Hope you didn't forget to call your mother Yeah
247629	249911	So, or whoever is important to you on this day.
249951	253353	I texted mine today and tried to call her and I sent grandmama text.
255554	259537	I haven't been super public about it, but my grandmama's in the hospital, which is why I'm going to Alabama.
259837	260037	Right.
260218	263580	So I sent my grandmama text and then I got a call from my granny after I left her message.
263840	266102	So I've spoken with maternal people in my life.
266342	266542	Good.
266902	271185	And as has my husband, spoken with his maternal figure and her maternal figure.
271912	277838	Now, I called my mom, but we're doing Mother's Day stuff tomorrow because my mom is very much like, well, not just because of this show.
277918	283303	I mean, she would understand that, but I didn't take her out to brunch or anything because she hates the crowds at restaurants more than I do.
283424	284705	She's like, I don't want to go out today.
284765	285526	It's too crowded.
286186	286987	So we're going tomorrow.
287528	288849	And you know where my mom likes to go?
288929	290611	You know where her favorite restaurant is?
291952	292573	This is so bad.
292593	294555	You know where my mom's favorite restaurant is where she likes to go?
294575	294835	What?
294935	295375	Chevy's.
296243	296803	You know what?
297224	298344	Didn't I talk about that last week?
298405	301347	Don't knock on Chevy's because they have actually a really super good salad.
304229	304489	All right.
305269	309472	Coming up later on the show in just a little while, we're going to be talking to Joe.
309832	316517	He is the creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone, which is a documentary all about the Legend of Zelda and Zelda fandom.
317338	321140	And you can check out more about that on Kickstarter or we've linked it on Twitter and so forth.
321240	324823	And we'll link it when we post the show on VOG and OrangeLauncher.com and all that, of course.
325063	325945	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
337651	342274	Well, I've been trying to keep myself super distracted just because of all the stuff going on in my family.
343975	355641	I've been playing Tomb Raider, I started Saints Row the 3rd, and then promptly turned it off because I forgot that I had left it running while I went to bed because I kind of passed out from four glasses of umeshu.
356662	357842	I've been doing a lot of drinking this week.
357862	358863	I don't know if you noticed.
359543	360084	My poor liver.
361665	365687	I started playing Ragnarok Online 2 now that they finally got the shit working.
366407	381572	and it's so cute and there's like pourings and flips and they're cute and you can smack the shit out of them you start off the game smacking the shit out of pourings that's the best way to start a game and those little bastards thankfully don't steal your shit anymore
381932	385436	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
403594	414061	and some of the job classes have been turned into like the blacksmith profession is actually now a job instead of a fighter class.
414341	416703	So that's kind of what they did in 14 a little bit.
416983	417203	Yeah.
417844	417984	Yeah.
418724	420105	You've held up your end of the blood pact.
437762	438982	Yes, now my blood is mine.
441143	451265	I have also been playing a game called Off, which I am now to the first world after whatever Area Zero is.
451885	458106	And it's weird, and I like it, except I wish I could play it windowed, but I kind of understand why you can't, because of how the game is programmed.
458767	464068	So, it's very weird, and I suggest that everybody in the universe play it, because it's fucking weird.
465048	465148	And...
468135	470818	I'm going to go ahead and count this in my gaming week.
470938	473480	I've been rereading all of Homestuck.
474161	478284	And so I've been actually playing through all the little mini Flash games and everything.
478745	481707	To the point that I'm thinking about reteaching myself Flash.
482708	486311	To do a few little mini games for VOG.
487032	487732	Yeah, just fun stuff.
490414	492354	I am also, did I say Tomb Raider?
492374	498196	Yeah, I was playing Tomb Raider or Lara Croft's Really Shitty Day or what did Alan call it?
498256	498516	Girl.
499176	499636	Yeah, girl.
499777	500077	Girl.
500577	501337	The game, girl.
501437	509219	And I'm also playing Mass Effect 3 again because I'm live streaming it so that I can completely make fun of the game live on air.
510340	514161	And I have adjusted my time slot so that I do not overlap Loki's streaming.
515908	517710	or anything else on VOG, of course.
517930	518671	Ah, screw all that.
518851	519412	No, I'm kidding.
520053	522956	Now, I have been... Oh, did you change your picture to Clue?
523677	523937	Yes.
524317	525899	Don't talk about what I'm doing on the computer over here.
525919	527241	Sorry, I like Clue.
527261	527921	Terrible radio.
528002	528622	I like Clue.
529203	530004	Yeah, no, I do too.
530204	531165	We need to do like...
533267	535690	An online tabletop RP Clue.
536170	536891	RP Clue?
537472	538673	Yeah, it's like a VOG thing.
538693	539434	That would be hilarious.
539454	545861	Well, I've been working hard on the shadow casting here in Sacramento, so if you happen to be local, July 27th, I'm playing Colonel Mustard in Clue.
545941	546381	It'll be fun.
547302	547763	It's gonna be fun.
548363	549465	Please, there are ladies present.
551587	553549	All right, Loki, tell us about your gaming week.
554447	557810	This week I played, what did I play this week?
558671	569199	Well I know I played Forza because we did the VOG gaming night and stuff and we've been averaging one extra person each week so next week, yeah, that would be awesome.
569239	574763	Next week is going to be Grand Theft Auto 4 on the free roam because that was Bobby's suggestion.
575473	576635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
593289	615285	and my hindsight I was actually going to loan you a copy if you didn't have it but I forgot to bring one so oh well so yeah we're going to be doing that and then yeah so you'll be joining in that'll be fun we'll just be messing around driving around you want to know what's hilarious about that it's still in the shrink wrap that sounds like games at my house Rob that is a crime
616442	616642	Vagirator
639774	665596	um so so yes that'll be fun uh I finished also Call of Duty uh Modern Warfare 3 the campaign of that so that was okay and uh what else um I know I played some PC games this week well I played one PC game but you know I could say what it is but I can't tell you anything about it other than what it was
666320	669988	Stay tuned to VOGnetwork.com It's a game that's coming out next week.
671050	673755	You'll have to see what my opinion was tomorrow.
675238	676361	So yeah, I guess that was it.
676441	676782	That's it?
678118	698195	My game of the week, a lot of the same old stuff, World of Warcraft, obviously, because unlike DarkSakura, I still play an awful lot, although I've kind of learned how to have fun by myself in a while, because a lot of my friends are quitting left and right, but we still have the Horde House Guild, which is nice, because I still see some people on there occasionally, so I can at least be a little social, and I even ran random dungeons with some people last night.
699056	699756	That I didn't even know.
699796	700836	I just knew through the show guild.
701757	702337	But I had fun.
703097	706858	But I've been playing a lot more PvP, which is kind of how I've been entertaining myself.
706878	710898	And I know a lot of people are like, oh my god, I'm so scared of PvP because people are mean and so on.
710938	712419	But I've just been having fun with it.
712499	714139	And when people are mean, right click, ignore.
714499	715819	And I never have to see their ass again.
715899	716519	It's awesome.
717200	719720	But I've also been playing some console games.
721160	723521	One of the new games I've been playing lately, we got an email the other week.
724485	725586	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
744988	748869	Best way I could describe it is it's a roguelike game, if you know what that is.
748949	757771	It's like a dungeon crawler and rogue-like is because it's like this old, old, old, old game back on terminal computers called Rogue, which was a lot of fun when I was younger.
758251	759732	But it's like that.
759772	763152	You're kind of crawling around a dungeon and it's a lot of puzzle solving.
763212	772014	There will be doors and keys and levers that open things and so forth and monsters you have to kill, but maybe they keep spawning unless you do this one thing.
772835	773395	For example...
774275	775696	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
794929	795670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
814102	815223	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
841225	844026	Virtual console stuff on Wii U has been my other little obsession.
844046	846667	Playing Mega Man, Mario World, Kirby.
847587	851869	Looking forward because I hear Super Mario 2 is out next week, so I'll give me an excuse to play that again.
852349	854429	And you know what else is out next week?
854769	855250	Big deal.
855630	856290	Big deal, guys.
857650	858310	Super Metroid.
859331	859571	Yes!
860199	861600	Don't you already have Super Metroid?
861700	865344	I have Super Metroid on an actual cartridge for that Super Nintendo sitting right over there.
865424	871089	But I will play it again on the Wii U because it's an amazing excuse to play through it again.
871990	880879	And plus it'll be slightly different coming through the speakers on the little game pad and TV.
881639	885323	And I'm all about playing Super Metroid in as many different ways as I possibly can.
887068	887968	So there you go.
888048	889109	That was pretty much my gaming week.
889789	894391	So a little bit of housekeeping before we get into tonight's news and our interview coming up in just a few more minutes.
894931	897773	I want to say, of course, if you're not following us on Twitter, you really ought to be.

911338	912919	Just search for Orange Lounge Radio.
913639	919263	Um, YYR in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, isn't Super Metroid going to be 30 cents?
919683	920143	Correct.
920563	922104	Yes, it is only going to be 30 cents.
922124	924986	And YYR follows that up with, then everyone should be buying it.
925467	925987	Correct.
926287	936633	If you actually own a Wii U and you have a way to pay for things online, I realize not everybody has a credit card, but you seriously should go to Target and get the $5 card just so you can buy this game.
937254	939815	And if you get it quickly, you can get Kirby for 30 cents still too.
940096	940496	Just saying.
940516	940556	Um,
941316	947579	Koopa Kid Jeremy in chatroom from Koopa Club, howdy, says Super Metroid should be purchased in every form.
947819	948079	Agree.
948799	948979	See?
949879	950600	Jeremy knows what's up.
951480	952100	He understands.
953261	955362	Super Metroid greater than everything else.
956102	957462	Alright, let's get into some news.
957502	959403	Let's do at least one of our news items real quick.
959443	959703	Loki.
960263	961604	Except for Super Super Metroid.
961624	963725	You know, that'd be funny.
963965	966946	Well, and I never got into Metroid Prime as much as I did the 2D Metroids.
966966	968987	What if they did a Super Metroid 2?
970484	975170	Well, I mean, Zero Mission and Fusion, kind of.
975210	978574	More of a remake, sort of.
979375	986484	If they did something in the Super Metroid universe on the 3DS akin to what they're doing with Zelda, I'd have a nerd boner.
986644	986904	I would.
987325	987926	How could you not?
990603	991844	I love the 2D Metroids.
992044	993345	The 3D ones aren't bad.
993385	997748	I really enjoy the third game in the 3D series for some reason.
997788	998949	I know a lot of people hated that one.
999269	1001811	And I even like the DS Prime Hunters thing.
1001831	1003652	That was a cool little concept.
1004153	1005133	It's not the same.
1005514	1009156	When you get all Doom up in here with my Metroid, it's not the same.
1009176	1014660	It's not bad, but I'm not as fanboy as I am over something like Super Metroid.
1014760	1015681	Anyway, news.
1015941	1016821	Anyways, so...
1019187	1028071	Sony's definitely trying to get more indie games on their services, and one way they're planning on doing that is actually waiving the license fee for PlayStation Mobile.
1028431	1040277	Now, PlayStation Mobile's on pretty much everything PlayStation, including Vita and PSP, as well as PlayStation Mobile-approved phones, whatever that might be.
1042438	1043199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1064556	1065576	You can actually find this.
1066997	1067938	It should be available now.
1068498	1070800	And they are featuring all sorts of games.
1071320	1077885	Some of the bigger named indie titles like Retro City Rampage, Papo Yo, and Dyad.
1078145	1078725	That kind of stuff.
1080286	1085550	But definitely a step in the opposite direction than Microsoft is taking.
1086850	1088871	Do you think that this could be in response?
1089051	1100400	Like this is a place where maybe they see that Microsoft is vulnerable right now having done what they did with XNA where Sony's like, hmm, maybe we should just kind of pluck that idea and implement it.
1100580	1109708	Well, I think that they see a lot of popularity with the indie scene kind of rising up again with Kickstarter projects and just indie games in general, Steam Greenlight and that kind of stuff.
1110668	1120536	And so if it's easy for people to bring that content that may be on PC right now to the PlayStation Network, then they're all for it.
1120556	1124979	That's more eyes on the PlayStation Network and more reason to buy a console that plays those games.
1126320	1129823	I'm sure Retro City Rampage, a pretty good example.
1130764	1135909	Hotline Miami, I think that's coming or already out for the Vita and PlayStation 3.
1137951	1138771	Lots of games like that.
1138891	1142435	So yeah, it's definitely good.
1142475	1144497	Promote more people to come to your platform.
1145317	1147579	Definitely better than go away.
1149661	1157264	Um, YYR in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, personally, I think the removal of the $99 fee is just because they want to increase the number of titles available.
1157525	1165268	Well, certainly, you know, um, anything to add value to the Vita, I think is going to be something Sony is going to want to explore for real.
1166168	1166748	So, hmm.
1167589	1167709	Um,
1169606	1176930	YYR also follows that up with Microsoft is actually paying $100 to anyone who submits a Windows 8 app through the end of June.
1176950	1177570	Yeah, but that's Windows 8.
1177791	1180512	No one wants to submit a Windows 8 app.
1180592	1189357	Going back a story a minute here because this is something we neglected to mention during Metroid talk, but TigerClaw on chat says Metroid Other M was more of a direct sequel to Super Metroid.
1189457	1190217	I forgot about that.
1190237	1192398	I think a lot of people do because it wasn't developed by Nintendo.
1192418	1195260	It was that whole Team Ninja third-party experiment thing.
1195760	1203603	I didn't hate Metroid Other M as much as some people did, but obviously I didn't remember it either, so I think that kind of tells you where Other M is.
1207764	1211525	And Metroid Other M kind of sounds like... It was a weird title, too.
1211545	1212445	Coca-Cola Classic.
1212766	1217087	It's the Un-Cola, or not Cola, I guess that would be 7-Up, or...
1217338	1238568	titles are so important and I think a lot of times people kind of forget that I mean I get that they want to get a title that really conveys the message of the story of the game or whatever and I get it but there's so many more people that would have just been like oh Super Metroid 2 other M heck yeah you know I think I think that carries a lot of weight that sometimes people forget about anyway
1239268	1240849	Um, what else do I want to ask on the indies?
1240869	1241890	Going back to the indies for a minute.
1241910	1243291	Do you think this is going to be embraced?
1243651	1245092	Uh, do you, by the indie community?
1245173	1249456	Not so much Sony, but do you, do you see that people would be like, yeah, I'm going to develop for the Vita?
1250496	1253799	Um, I don't know how easy it is to develop for the Vita.
1254099	1264086	But I know like a lot of those Kickstarter projects you see, you always see Wii U as actually a platform as, okay, my indie tile is going up on Wii U, which is kind of interesting.
1265007	1265107	Um,
1266738	1267458	I mean, it couldn't hurt.
1267578	1275881	I think if they are struggling with financing, then definitely removing that fee would help.
1277081	1279842	Hopefully get more games on there.
1279942	1287564	Hopefully that doesn't mean that's going to dilute the games that are on there with a lot of garbage indie games and stuff, but I don't know.
1288284	1289945	Sorry about the little ding-dong, by the way.
1290026	1296290	My Facebook thing decided to go off, which I hate that stupid beep-beep on Facebook.
1296430	1297251	You can't turn it off.
1297291	1300813	You heard what you're going to be able to expect coming soon.
1301214	1302515	Autoplane video ads.
1304676	1306658	I'm just ready to leave Facebook forever.
1306898	1307578	Can't wait.
1313703	1314303	Hi, Dead Air.
1314704	1315164	Sorry about that.
1316425	1321886	I just completely am really... I've turned off every type of notification I possibly can for Facebook.
1322746	1325287	And now they've actually started being able to bypass my ad block.
1326247	1327968	Ranma in chat says you can disable it.
1328008	1329488	Well, I need to do my more research.
1329568	1333829	But I'll have to do that later because it is time to bring on to the show Joe.
1333949	1337110	And Joe is a creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone.
1337250	1339870	It's a movie that is a Zelda documentary.
1340270	1342711	And we're going to try to get him on the line right now to talk about...
1343271	1357304	This Kickstarter project and the movie which has a trailer which you can watch if you go over to the Kickstarter page and search for It's Dangerous to Go Alone or if you just search for Zelda movie you'll probably find it and you can see the trailer and check out what this project is all about.
1357684	1359106	But I believe Joe is with us right now.
1359166	1359666	Joe, you there?
1360267	1360987	What's up, man?
1361067	1361988	Hey, how you doing, Joe?
1362649	1363550	I am excellent.
1363590	1367093	Just enjoyed a beautiful day at the beach in sunny Sarasota, Florida.
1367293	1367793	Thank you for watching!
1380923	1391568	Well, you know, we're out in California, so I associate everything Florida with Disney World, and four of my closest friends are all at Disney World right now, but not me.
1391589	1392089	That's hilarious.
1392409	1393369	Not me, I know.
1393890	1396931	All right, we're not here to talk about Disney, we are here to talk about Zelda.
1397431	1397872	Yes, sir.
1398152	1399933	Yeah, tell us a little bit about your project, Joe.
1401173	1401674	Well, it's...
1402956	1407638	A couple years ago, I was actually with my production partner up in Baltimore when I was living up there.
1408558	1411419	We were playing through Zelda 2 because we'd never beat it as kids.
1413720	1426345	We just went on a mission and bought a bunch of alcohol and played through Zelda 2 and started conceiving of a documentary project that we could do about the ubiquity and cultural influence of The Legend of Zelda.
1426365	1432087	We had a lot of artistic friends who were either filmmakers or musicians or artists or writers or whatever that were all
1432687	1440491	We all grew up together playing those games, and it was sort of our first opening of our imaginations was through the world of Hyrule.
1441031	1449555	And so it kind of planted a seed of an idea of, hey, that would make for a cool documentary someday, and all of our other projects are wrapped up or whatever.
1450215	1474325	and a couple years later just I found myself in a perfect time to film that exact movie and I started putting the feelers out and seeing you know we did start doing some research started doing some legal work and found just a you know a trove of awesome people that that are you know legitimate artists and filmmakers and out in Hollywood and illustrators for Google and best-selling authors and all these people that wanted to be involved in that
1474665	1479447	were hugely inspired by the franchise, and we said, yes, okay, this is a really cool project that we want to do.
1479528	1484270	So, yeah, that's how it started, and it's been very cool getting it up and running.
1484690	1495495	So hearing you talk about that and watching the trailer, would you say that this movie is less about necessarily Zelda and Link and the characters and the story, but it's much more about the fans and the culture?
1496076	1497897	Yeah, I'm not going to say it's...
1499631	1511851	it's void of talking about Zelda of course but it's definitely more about not the fandom necessarily but how it has impacted us in a cultural way in such a
1513080	1516123	It's such a profound way that it's hard to even estimate.
1516203	1522768	For instance, you know, as kids, we're all playing this child's video game, you know, and our parents definitely don't get it.
1522788	1523929	We're six, seven years old.
1524169	1525550	We're playing this Nintendo game.
1526691	1531995	And at that time, me and my best friend, we'd play through these worlds and, you know, all the way up through A Link to the Past.
1532035	1533416	We were really passionate about it.
1533456	1534357	We were really into it.
1534878	1538941	And that best friend that I had growing up with that game, he now works for the
1542045	1542425	and so on.
1560124	1562205	and all the cool things that they're doing now.
1562485	1567147	And they kind of owe a lot of their art or love for fantasy to that franchise.
1567547	1571629	So what notes do I play on the Ocarina to unlock those big bank accounts?
1571749	1572569	That's what I want to know.
1572609	1574370	That is an excellent, excellent question.
1574590	1576210	I'll tell you what, that will definitely help fund.
1576250	1577731	If you find out, let me know.
1578551	1579732	The film will do a little bit better.
1581092	1591096	Well, you know, I gotta say, you know, my memories of Zelda myself, Zelda, and specifically that game, was how I got to become more popular in elementary school.
1591116	1593997	Because, you know, I got picked on... You were that guy, too.
1594197	1594617	I was.
1595398	1597279	People would come to you and ask you, where is that thing?
1597299	1597879	And you would know.
1598559	1598999	That is awesome.
1625440	1626200	So I feel you, man.
1626300	1627041	I'm right there with you.
1627941	1628881	And this is exactly the thing.
1628901	1631622	Now, here you are doing a podcast on gaming.
1632022	1637804	And really, if it wasn't for games like that, you might not be doing what you're doing.
1638344	1638864	Absolutely.
1639905	1642265	It's fascinating to look at that and where people have come.
1643006	1645206	So why did you turn to Kickstarter?
1645286	1648447	You're asking for $50,000 to fund the project.
1648527	1650768	So what is the $50,000 for?
1651128	1653289	And ultimately, why should we consider backing it?
1654065	1654945	Ah, because it's awesome.
1654985	1655105	No.
1655966	1661207	Well, first of all, we're competing with, say, the My Little Pony documentary, which got funded for $322,000.
1664809	1673311	For those people who aren't filmmakers or don't know, for those of you who are filmmakers, you probably know that $50,000 is a very, very small budget.
1673331	1674792	That's a micro-budget production.
1675230	1675711	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1693170	1693370	and so on.
1722069	1738532	We're actually really trying to get some unique one-on-one personal stories with people like Howard Phillips who started Nintendo Power and the guys from Rainfall that did that awesome April Fool's Day trailer for The Legend of Zelda for IGN a couple years ago.
1738812	1739653	Which was awesome.
1739993	1740453	Yeah, yeah.
1740774	1745577	And these are all people that we've talked to that either we've already got interviews with or they're lined up.
1746698	1752903	We're going to have way more footage than we're going to be able to fit inside of our 90, 100-minute documentary.
1753383	1755665	But we want to travel to these places.
1756205	1766909	and sit down with these people and see what they're doing now with their lives and find out how exactly Zelda has inspired them and how they've maintained with the series as they've grown up and become adults.
1767150	1770691	Their children are now playing the games and see their impressions of it.
1771191	1776233	So because of that, we're going to be traveling a lot and a lot of the money is for travel.
1776733	1779655	A lot of it's also for the distribution once the film is complete.
1780635	1781715	How do you get it out there?
1781875	1785376	We could just put it up on YouTube, but that's not the kind of film that we're creating.
1785596	1786836	You want something on the big screen.
1787216	1790417	The physical media, digital distribution channels, things like that.
1790537	1793658	So that's where really the money is going to be going.
1793698	1797178	And like I said, $5 million is a low-budget film.
1797918	1801139	$50,000, that's a micro-budget documentary film.
1802699	1805440	And the reason I think we turned to Kickstarter –
1805762	1807223	We really wanted to do a crowdfunding.
1807243	1816008	We've actually got a couple of decent offers as far as people who want to back this project in more traditional terms like investment-wise or producer-wise.
1816448	1817609	And that will be awesome.
1817629	1820351	And if the Kickstarter doesn't work out, we'll pursue those.
1820691	1827315	But we love the idea of Kickstarter and this being a project where we're not trying to appease investors.
1827795	1830296	This is a project for the community.
1830316	1833018	This is a project that belongs to the community.
1833298	1834539	Everyone has a little piece of it.
1834918	1835659	Okay, awesome.
1835979	1843164	Well, speaking of community, we have our live listeners assembled in the live chat room, live.vognetwork.com if you're listening live on this Sunday night.
1843504	1852411	And if you have a question for Joe about this project, It's Dangerous to Go Alone, the movie, send us a question and we'll possibly read it and ask it of Joe.
1852571	1854914	Well, lately it's just been a debate over what the best Zelda game is.
1855274	1856816	Oh, is that what's going on in chat right now?
1856956	1858418	I side with the Link to the Past people.
1859038	1861601	Me too, but I know there's a lot of... Well, you know what's funny about that?
1862042	1866827	I'm of the same school, and just out of curiosity, how old are you guys?
1866847	1866827	37.
1867488	1872414	34.
1867949	1872414	Okay, we're all... I'll be 33 in a couple of days, so we're all kind of in that...
1873055	1874897	Age, where we grew up with all the Zelda games.
1874977	1880622	And I'm curious about the young people who started with 3D Zelda games.
1881543	1884186	If they go back and play length of the past, do they have that same experience?
1884534	1889200	But the one thing that makes me think that maybe they do, and we're examining this in the documentary too, by the way, a little bit.
1890342	1897010	There's as much excitement and anticipation for the sequel to Link to the Past as there is for the Wii U Zelda.
1898873	1902758	I think that's really telling as far as how compelling that game was.
1903398	1909384	and how the 3D element, it's awesome and the visual element's great, but that doesn't make the game necessarily.
1909765	1912227	You know, a good story makes a good game.
1912828	1913128	Exactly.
1913148	1914809	Especially in that series.
1916091	1926901	And I think, though, that there has to be elements of gameplay that, you know, are just the right level of frustrating versus rewarding for your frustration to make it feel like you're...
1927802	1929084	Cursing Like 10-Year-Olds
1943575	1947917	You should hear me and my husband whenever that game gets broken out at my house.
1948058	1958283	It's just like... But honestly, I think that Link to the Past took the formula from the first game that everyone seems to have liked so much better and really perfected it.
1958303	1961364	And if they can keep that going with the sequel, then I think the sequel is going to be successful.
1961784	1965986	And then you might see a bigger console release following suit.
1966047	1967207	And man, that would be awesome.
1968048	1970809	With the capabilities you'd have for a Wii U title...
1971390	1974317	to be gameplay-wise more like Link to the Past.
1974598	1977505	I would be really curious to see where they could go with that.
1978156	1984200	I think Bobby Blackwolf, who's always on before us here at VOG Network, he has a good comparison that probably applies here too.
1984521	1989484	Because he always talks about Final Fantasy and that your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that was out when you were 13.
1990024	1993507	So probably with Zelda, a lot of that's true too.
1993727	1997429	Yeah, your first experience in that universe, definitely.
1998110	1999631	And it is something that we're examining.
1999671	2000432	And actually there's a writer...
2001968	2019877	and I'm not going to talk too much about it right now you have to just wait for the movie but if we include his segment he talks a little bit about the difference between cinematic storytelling in games and video games themselves and almost creates two different mediums and he talks about how console games currently are
2020148	2048632	they're more like cinematic experiences rather than true game experiences and there's a really strong divide between the two and the more recent console games for Zelda and stuff and for everything have gone more towards that cinematic experience but a game like the sequel to Link to the Past will be back to the center is not the story the center is the gameplay mechanics and the story is almost incidental they still want it to be very strong but that's not the focus the focus is the game itself
2049864	2051886	It's a really interesting thing to think about.
2052486	2057089	Let me ask you this question since I did bring up another franchise a minute ago that has a lot of fan passion too.
2057149	2058470	Final Fantasy, absolutely.
2058510	2059671	Why did you go with Zelda?
2059731	2062273	Why not Final Fantasy, Mario, Samus?
2062633	2065175	Why not another character that we remember when we were young?
2065215	2066676	Why did you go for Link and Zelda?
2067156	2067516	Zeldagaming.com
2086276	2112488	and so it's not just necessarily about Zelda but that's the core of it Zelda and why Zelda over the other franchises we just found that it was absolutely ubiquitous just everywhere and I mean Final Fantasy you could probably find the same thing for somebody who's in love with Final Fantasy myself I just again finally played through all of Final Fantasy 6 and beat it a month ago I played it three times the first time when I was a kid I never beat it
2112608	2113289	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2133286	2138430	I feel like gaming wouldn't exist in its current form had it not been for the original Legend of Zelda.
2138850	2145135	It might never have grown into what it is without those early franchise games and I think that was one of the core ones.
2145895	2152400	We all, at 5, 6, 7 to 10 years old, we all felt this connection to that reality for some reason.
2152580	2153700	DarkSakura, you had another question for Joe?
2174326	2174826	I did actually.
2174866	2189016	Have you also been exploring, since you're looking at the general, I guess the genre of that type of game as well, are you also looking at some of the, for lack of a better description, clones on other systems like Newtopia that came out for the TurboGrafx-16?
2189617	2191318	Even Legend of Valkyrie was kind of the same.
2191958	2193359	Sort of.
2193379	2194040	There's a point.
2194680	2197802	Again, there's so much footage that's going to be shot for this documentary.
2198222	2202145	We're going to have to really make some difficult decisions in the editing room.
2202365	2205287	There was a point where we talked a little bit about Chrysalis for the NES.
2205507	2213473	Not a different system, but what Zelda could have evolved into had there been another NES release.
2214673	2215694	We talk a lot about that.
2218236	2221498	We don't get too much into cross-platform mostly because I guess we're all
2222358	2229227	You were either a Nintendo kid or you were a Sega kid when growing up, and it sounds like you guys were both Nintendo kids, so you understand.
2229247	2232050	No, no, this one was a Sega, very much a Sega kid.
2232351	2233152	Leave the room now.
2233212	2234574	You're no longer invited to talk.
2234594	2236296	Sorry, you're out of the conversation.
2236316	2238419	No, she was a Sega adult, I guess.
2238559	2241782	No, my husband grew up with a Master System and a Genesis.
2241802	2250648	I grew up with my NES, and my brother's SNES, when they moved, I bought my SNES, and then my husband said, look, Sega Saturn, and I forgot everything else existed.
2251249	2253391	And now my favorite system to this day is the TurboGrafx.
2254592	2254992	Interesting.
2255432	2256293	No, it's funny.
2257114	2265602	And I love it too because it's so fun to see the people's devotion to their – and when I was a kid, I was – like it was Nintendo.
2266423	2267124	F everybody else.
2267184	2268225	Screw Sega.
2268665	2268805	No.
2269826	2270407	I won't hear it.
2270687	2274290	I won't believe – and the fandom, it's not just fandom.
2274651	2275672	It's like your family member.
2275692	2278014	Like someone is talking bad about someone in your gang, you know?
2278274	2280417	It pained me when I jumped ship to PlayStation.
2280818	2281299	It pained me.
2281980	2282721	Yeah, really.
2283402	2287748	You almost are offended when your favorite releases aren't released on your console.
2288610	2288870	Why?
2288990	2291374	Why is Final Fantasy not on a Nintendo console anymore?
2291414	2291935	What happened?
2292736	2294098	And that was exactly it.
2295218	2299539	Just look for the N64 demo and then you'll realize why.
2299679	2300999	Let me get to some questions from chat.
2301039	2303680	We have a good one here from SSJ100 Matt who has a question for you.
2304560	2306280	What's Nintendo's stance on the project?
2306300	2308441	Have they contacted you or have you contacted them?
2308681	2318343	And the reason why I ask this is because I noticed with documentaries on a specific subject matter tend to get some type of resistance by the original creators wanting to have their own stamp on the project or have it told in a certain light.
2318943	2321526	Right, well, and that's a really tricky question.
2321566	2327894	We have tried to reach out to Nintendo, but, you know, I mean, there's literally a million people per day with a project to try and reach out to Nintendo.
2328335	2334002	So we do have sort of a second, like, a second degree contact relationship.
2334442	2337125	with Nintendo Legal, but we haven't really gotten any word back from them.
2337445	2343310	Fortunately for this project, our project is not about The Legend of Zelda per se.
2343691	2349056	We're not examining the particular artwork of the games or the stories of the games.
2349536	2359465	We're really examining how the public reacted to that artwork and how they responded and how it sort of gave them their own artistic appreciation for gaming or
2360308	2363893	spawned their love for art or creativity or music or whatever.
2365115	2370804	In that way, there's not really a lot of legal
2371710	2372210	Thank you for watching!
2400976	2402499	There is a problem with Nintendo Legal.
2403080	2410133	It would break our hearts because we hope that they support this project, but it's not going to stop the documentary just because of the nature of the documentary.
2410509	2410769	Okay.
2411850	2419318	Let me ask you this, because of course when it comes to Nintendo, the fanboys are pretty infamous in their passion for a lot of the Nintendo stuff.
2419879	2425164	And somebody linked me a thread on a Nintendo News website where the project got some cold reception.
2426326	2431171	What would you say to people that aren't getting this or think that you're trying to profit off Nintendo's IPs?
2431801	2442035	Oh man, there's so much stuff I wish I could talk about right now, but I am unable to talk about it until the Kickstarter campaign is complete because of Kickstarter's legal.
2442335	2448003	I don't mind if people are criticizing the take on the documentary.
2448043	2449004	They just don't like
2449662	2458767	I don't like the people who think that we're profiteering off this project We're probably not going to see a dime from this project I can't really go into much detail beyond that
2477327	2482629	but I will say that the profits beyond production costs will not be going to us.
2482869	2486370	That's all I can say about that.
2487130	2492372	As far as the people who don't like the style, there's people who want to hate things on the internet.
2492672	2502995	They see something, they're worried that we're going to destroy their childhood but for every one of those people, there's probably a thousand people that have contacted me and said, thank you for validating my entire childhood.
2503015	2503595	That's
2506025	2507165	My fiance can attest to it.
2507226	2509986	The first day I saw some of those negative reviews, I'm like, why?
2510127	2511307	No, I'm trying to do something.
2511327	2513288	You'll like it.
2513328	2518449	But after that, enough people prompted me that, hey, no, man, you've got to finish this.
2518489	2519330	I really want to see this.
2519530	2520950	It kind of made me feel a lot better about it.
2521931	2522971	I think people will enjoy it.
2523416	2532139	Well, you know, there's an old saying we have here at OLR, and it goes back to when we first got our first one-star reviews on iTunes and so forth, when, you know, we're paying out of pocket to do this show.
2532479	2534180	And it goes, haters gonna hate.
2534760	2534940	Yep.
2535060	2535820	That's what they say.
2535980	2537861	At least they're not telling you to get back in the kitchen.
2539262	2539582	That's right.
2539622	2547224	Well, you know, if you do something that is successful, and if this turns out to be successful, there are going to be people who will just hate it just because it was successful, too, you know?
2547725	2551546	Or that maybe they didn't think of it first, or that they would have done it a different way, or...
2552763	2553604	We'll accept that.
2553644	2555566	This is going to be our story in the way that we want to tell it.
2555766	2556687	We hope people like it.
2556867	2558069	If they don't, they don't need to watch it.
2558109	2558790	They don't need to buy it.
2558830	2560972	They could bash it all they want.
2561433	2566318	I feel like there's a good amount of people that do like this idea and want to see what we're coming up with for it.
2567299	2584355	Alright, well let me ask you one more question on a bit more of a positive note and then maybe if there's one or two more from chat I'll try to squeeze those in too but what do you hope, on a more positive note when people watch this movie and the credits roll, fade to black what feeling do you hope people walk away with after viewing your movie?
2584835	2586316	That's a great question.
2586876	2593781	I really hope that – I got a feeling that the vast majority of watchers are going to be people like our age that grew up with the entire series.
2594081	2597964	Those are the people that it's really sort of designed for and they're going to feel validated.
2597984	2606950	They're going to understand a little bit better this undefinable connection they have with that franchise and why that one above all the other ones.
2607590	2609251	Like you said, why not Metroid?
2609291	2610072	Why not Kid Icarus?
2610112	2611593	Why not even Super Mario Brothers?
2611877	2612838	I'm hoping they leave with that.
2631793	2642460	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I wonder if The Legend of Zelda has inspired people who work in the entertainment industry, be it in movies or television besides in gaming.
2642700	2643641	Well, you work in movies.
2644942	2648885	We've got one Hollywood writer
2649443	2654625	that is very much backing the project financially and has agreed to be in it.
2655805	2661427	So he has requested that I not talk about that too much because he's got another Kickstarter campaign going right now.
2661967	2662827	He doesn't want to split.
2662947	2666348	But no, we actually have some people in Hollywood that we'll be talking to in the documentary.
2667008	2670509	Like I said, the people that work at Rainfall that did that cool IGN trailer.
2671690	2673270	So they're going to be in it.
2673470	2675531	And also some gaming companies that are more –
2676786	2677387	Thanks for watching!
2692224	2698808	One more question here from YYR in our chatroom, and this one might be a little bit tricky, but it's fair based on Nintendo's actions in the past.
2699388	2705871	If you go forward with this, and Nintendo gives you a cease and desist right before you release, but all the money's been spent, what happens then?
2706151	2720639	Is that... Yeah, I mean, it's... I can't say it's a 0% threat, but we've done everything to minimize that, and there's... Like I said, the US has some great fair use laws for documentary and filmmakers...
2721371	2731680	were pretty well versed in those and having done documentaries in the past and we worked with a legal team for about six months before we even considered that this was a realistic project that we wanted to
2732082	2732822	to attempt doing.
2733582	2737684	So we're really, really, really working hard to stay on the side of fair use.
2737724	2740805	And like I said, in some cases that means we had to scrap some of the ideas.
2742125	2748767	But even if they tried to slap a cease and desist on us, which like I said, I hope that they end up in full support of the project.
2749147	2756890	But even if they tried, they really wouldn't have a lot of legal backing in the way that we're telling this story.
2758942	2760503	We're working really hard on that.
2760523	2766847	I can never say it's a 0% possibility, but we're being very, very, very careful about that.
2767308	2773592	The best that probably would be able to happen was they'd have to say that this scene and or that scene would have to be cut from the film.
2774092	2776894	And aside from that, the film would be definitely still produced.
2777054	2777374	Gotcha.
2777605	2785891	Well, you know, when I think of a movie like King of Kong, which obviously everybody knows with documentary and gaming, and Donkey Kong was a Nintendo game, and that movie happened, so...
2794358	2820653	everybody trying to beat that score not to mention all of the other footage of Midway games and Namco other things in that too and I encourage anybody who's interested in doing projects like this to check out the fair use laws and see how they protect documentary filmmakers and things like that one of the scenes that's difficult is the scenes from the Symphony of the Goddesses
2822318	2822999	Thank you for watching!
2838613	2864812	in the course of the documentary so you know there's things like that like yeah there's imagery shown on the big jumbotron behind the orchestra playing Zelda themes but they were able to grant us permission to use it there was just that stipulation so again you know um the the capturing of the imagery at that point was incidental it was commentary on the the music going from 8-bit chiptune to full-on orchestration and and because it's commentary like that I'm
2865194	2869337	If you really look into the fair use laws, you'll see how that works a little bit better.
2870318	2878605	Anybody who's interested in doing a project like this, I encourage doing that and really studying it and getting with somebody who knows entertainment law before you try and take it on.
2879775	2882217	Well, Joe, you're very passionate about this project.
2882257	2882778	I can hear it.
2883058	2885860	I can tell that you're a longtime fan of gaming and so forth.
2885941	2888643	And I really wish you the best of luck with this project and getting funded.
2889404	2890124	Anything else you want to say?
2890144	2894909	You want to tell the listeners one more time how to check out the project and what it's all about and consider funding?
2895649	2899212	Sure, a couple more things I'd love to talk about if you can give me just a couple more minutes.
2899352	2899933	You got it.
2900553	2910221	If you guys go to www.thezeldamovie.com, if you're on a computer as opposed to a mobile device, there's a nice little 8-bit game that is the navigation for our site.
2911242	2912543	It's kind of fun just to play through.
2912563	2916826	A lot of people have, and you get to a windscreen, and you get to see two extra minutes of the film.
2918087	2920129	But yeah, if you check that out, that'll also lead you.
2920169	2921590	There's a link there to our Kickstarter page.
2921770	2922291	www.TheZeldaMovie.com
2937072	2937733	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2960302	2985464	and we're going to try and make that available definitely for iOS devices, probably for Android and something that's a standalone Mac and PC game as well and that's not going to be like the 8-bit game on the site that's going to be a very unique digital experience inspired by the gameplay and mechanics of original Legend of Zelda games but resemble and look more of a contemporary modern video game so we hope that that's the way most people watch it that's how it's intended to be watched
2986653	2992255	Well, that sounds like a cool little extra, and I think I saw some rewards in the Kickstarter have to do with being a part of that game.
2992996	2996537	That game or the 8-bit game that's going to be on the site for the duration of the film, yep.
2996737	2997598	Nice, very nice.
2997938	3002139	Well, best of luck to you, Joe, in the project, and thanks for sitting down with us today.
3002920	3009642	You know, I hear that our pal Bobby Blackwolf here at the Voice Geeks Network, who did a story on this before, might be in the movie.
3010803	3015645	He was actually out at one of our first filming experiences in Atlanta, and we're going back up there
3016169	3016649	in June.
3016709	3020852	And he's been a very strong proponent of the film, which I appreciate.
3020872	3021472	That's awesome.
3021932	3028676	And it's great to know that as a fellow gamer and a fellow Zelda freak, that he supports the project fully.
3029416	3029756	Absolutely.
3029796	3030356	So that's awesome.
3030697	3030877	All right.
3030897	3031897	Well, we support you too.
3032017	3033518	So best of luck to you, Joe.
3033658	3036160	Thanks for... Now, where are you guys at in California?
3036220	3038081	We are in Sacramento, California.
3038101	3039021	Love Sacramento, man.
3039061	3040762	When I get out there, I'll make sure to look you guys up.
3040902	3046266	Hey, my friend's husband went to school with the lead singer And I used to work with their old drummer's girlfriend So yeah
3063658	3064600	It's also a small town.
3064660	3065040	No, alright.
3065461	3069207	Alright, Joe, you take care and thanks again for sitting down with us tonight and best of luck on your Kickstarter, alright?
3069668	3070048	Thanks, guys.
3070189	3070910	Alright, you're welcome.
3070950	3071331	Have a good one.
3071791	3072552	Take care.
3072753	3077641	www.TheZeldaMovie.com for more information on It's Dangerous to Go Alone.
3078379	3080301	Loki, did you enjoy hearing what that guy had to say?
3080321	3090193	Yeah, the only thing I was kind of combing through the rewards, a little disappointed to see that there's not a wooden sword as a reward, like an actual sword.
3090213	3091014	Like an actual wooden sword.
3091054	3091855	I mean, it would be that hard.
3091895	3094939	You just take a couple two-by-fours and slap it together.
3094979	3095199	I mean...
3097062	3103728	Alright, well, maybe in the future, maybe you'll hear this back and think about adding something like that.
3104249	3105931	A little hard to ship, you know.
3106331	3107432	That's true, that's true.
3107492	3109394	And some people frown on sending weapons in the mail.
3110235	3111937	Anyhow, let's move on with other video gaming.
3111977	3112618	Thank you for watching.
3138001	3142665	If you cancelled a gold auction, you got refunded double the amount.
3143566	3143906	Oops!
3145267	3151612	So people were exploiting this left and right to generate trillions of gold.
3152573	3157217	Isn't this the whole reason why Diablo 3 clung to this always online thing?
3157277	3164062	It's not about the DRM, it's about the integrity and the auction house, da da da, and then they fucked it up with this bug.
3164242	3164903	Womp womp.
3166084	3167749	So why bother with always online?
3167769	3174127	Well, I guess that's maybe why the PlayStation 4 and 3 ones are going to go a different route and not have to worry about that shit, right?
3176743	3190252	Well, if there is any possible silver lining to this, Blizzard, in talking about the bug, said that just 415 players, all of which were sanctioned, actually used the exploit.
3190852	3201739	And the real money auction sales that were generated as a part of this, all of the proceeds will be redirected to the Children's Miracle Network hospitals.
3202219	3210705	If you had a legitimate transaction, you have nothing to worry about, but if you were one of these 415 sellers that sold the excess gold, guess who really got your money?
3210905	3211385	Charity.
3211826	3217190	I always hate that they always punish people that exploit bugs in games.
3217350	3218911	If you're hacking, that's one thing.
3218991	3222033	If you're exploiting a bug or glitch, that's kind of dumb.
3222113	3223774	Yeah, but you should have seen some of these people, man.
3243423	3246384	You're waiting for these guys to get the banhammer, and it's kind of hilarious.
3246564	3247645	Come on, Loki, you gotta admit.
3248005	3250446	Like, a guy like that, kind of asking for it, right?
3265291	3285252	and so they patch that out and you can actually get like banned or you know short-term banned for using these glitches in game like what the hell it it's a container that you can jump on how why should that be a bannable offense well it's just weird to me that somehow this really horrific bug was missed i mean this is huge i it's
3286272	3291055	I don't know, it just kind of goes to show that even tying your game to online may not fix all your problems.
3291195	3307186	It's weird that you might have a bug like that and then sometimes you may have a bug that causes your workers not to drive their cars to work and instead walk up a giant hill and lose their jobs because they're too far away from... Oh, I have to be the Sims.
3309167	3310068	Alright, moving on.
3310088	3313751	That's why you just cheat and give yourself the motherload code and buy a teleporter.
3315114	3317035	I mean, I don't do anything like that at all, do I?
3317976	3323499	But the whole point of at least the older Sims game, I'm not talking about New Sim City, but all those cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat.
3323839	3325120	Everybody cheats in those games.
3325160	3326400	That's the fun of the game.
3326440	3330263	That's why this New Sim City was very like to me because it's always online.
3330303	3331043	How am I going to cheat?
3331663	3334365	Which I know they have their sandbox mode, but it's not the same.
3335027	3343109	The fun of The Sims for me was pretty much building my house and then getting all of the really dirty add-ons that people would make.
3343849	3348330	PrinceBrightstar in chat, an interesting comment, it's the difference between single and multiplayer games.
3348370	3356772	Diablo's auction house is very multiplayer, but see, that's where Diablo's in a weird place because a lot of people are like, I want to play Diablo as a single player game.
3357052	3361933	This is why I hated the online thing in the first place, is that it wasn't never a multiplayer thing to me.
3362353	3369035	For me, I think Diablo is more fun with more people, but I respect those that don't want to play the game that way.
3369876	3371336	Playing with other people is hell.
3371616	3373537	You know what would be awesome?
3374858	3379259	Because it reminds me of, like, what was it?
3379379	3379719	The...
3382140	3382921	DarkSakura.com
3406200	3415431	Anyway, there's a rumor going around, and there was even a fake logo out on Reddit about this, that the next Xbox was supposed to be called the Xbox Infinity.
3416652	3418695	Yeah.
3418835	3419215	I'm sorry.
3420076	3420277	Go ahead.
3420857	3424701	Well, this is supposed to be a report from the International Business Times.
3426723	3436512	And there was also supposed to be floating around in rumor land about an Xbox TV video streaming set that was mentioned via Wall Street Journal.
3437393	3442118	But Microsoft is like, we're not commenting on that because it's rumors and speculation.
3442458	3444380	And even if it's true, we aren't telling you.
3444619	3445720	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3463718	3466759	Fortunately, the Xbox Infinity thing, not true.
3467099	3472200	More likely is the fact Fusion, which would be... I still think that's a dumb name, too.
3472220	3477002	It would tie in with all the site registrations that they have for Xbox Fusion or something like that.
3477042	3478562	So some part of it... Still a dumb name.
3479342	3479623	Whatever.
3479643	3480083	So...
3481583	3484466	Yeah, Xbox Infinity, that's just a ridiculous name.
3484486	3485487	Because how do you go from there?
3485628	3487029	Infinity plus one.
3487329	3493376	At any rate, basically just talking about this for the sake of squashing the rumor mill.
3493836	3495338	It's not true.
3496960	3500704	Getting your information from Reddit would be like me writing my term paper on Wikipedia.
3501264	3502605	It could be correct, but you don't know.
3502625	3503706	You don't know who these people are.
3504066	3505307	I solve crimes on Reddit.
3505427	3505848	No, no, no.
3505968	3508410	There's nothing wrong with getting some news from Reddit.
3508490	3511953	As long as you back... As long as you... Okay, stuff leaks out.
3512153	3517017	It's fine if stuff leaks out, but you have to have some sort of evidence that leaks...
3518037	3536910	a screen a picture on reddit is not evidence that is like that's ridiculous right any to be fair i don't want to make it sound like we're dogging on reddit i love reddit i'm a user i i you know i post on things and and so forth and it's been a great uh place to enrich the the warcraft podcast community has a great subreddit
3537390	3544134	But, um, you have to, because Reddit is a part of the internet, you have to be a little bit of a skeptic.
3544274	3544854	You have to be.
3545034	3547315	I mean, it's just an extension of everything else on the internet.
3547335	3551357	Reddit's bad, but it's just like saying, you know, you saw a screenshot on some random website.
3552238	3556740	If you have nothing, if you have no, like, sort of evidence to back that up, you know...
3558399	3559700	Let's say you have actual sources.
3559760	3562482	Now we know that the International Business Times has no fucking sources.
3563462	3568005	Their sources are fucking some dude that's in their department or some intern.
3568045	3572568	Hey, I was on Reddit during a, quote, lunch, unquote.
3572588	3576951	Or examiner.com is almost all user-based.
3577171	3578592	And Forbes is going that way, too.
3578972	3581294	But here's the worst fucking part about that.
3582114	3586455	So they ran that story and they checked no sources or whatever, nothing.
3586876	3587636	And so they ran it.
3588416	3590357	Then everybody else ran it.
3590837	3591917	Everybody ran it.
3592117	3593758	It's like, what the fuck?
3594198	3596719	First off, these guys don't check their sources.
3596779	3598659	Then you just don't check your sources either.
3598939	3600340	You're just as bad as they are.
3600440	3605421	Oh, there's a lot of those journalist sites that keep their tabs on Reddit.
3605441	3606662	And then they respond, so...
3607162	3607622	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3629658	3644208	and you know when when our story got upvoted and all that on dig because people were you know seeing it on our site that's when it really blew up and it was everywhere and then you know it got got too far exposed but anyway
3644798	3661176	but I'm saying that there's it's just they're not thinking and if all these sites have sources though it just makes you wonder how legit these sources are if they're taking reddit photos I mean I'm not saying it's bad that it's on reddit but just like an anonymous
3662197	3662237	So...
3685585	3686106	Alright, anyhow.
3687368	3692935	I like the name Xbox Infinity, but that's about as far as I give this story anyway.
3693756	3694077	Sorry.
3694457	3694798	We'll see.
3695218	3696881	May 21st, it is almost here.
3697521	3699725	For God's sake.
3699925	3701307	One more show full of this crap.
3702466	3702926	You know what?
3703927	3704827	I don't even care.
3705127	3706568	I'm calling it the shitbox.
3708849	3709930	We already let our listeners vote.
3709970	3710770	It's Xbox Lube.
3711130	3711771	It's the Lube.
3712431	3718394	Or I'm going to build a new litter box for my cat that looks like whatever their new Xbox is so she can poop in it.
3718574	3719094	Alright.
3719374	3730700	What you need to do, I mean, it's begging for a Photoshop, but you know, Invader Zim had this alien race with the amazing fusion technology, and it's basically duct taping shit together, so...
3731580	3754198	I fused this phone with a hamster they already did that with two gamecubes I've known people who have held computers together via duct tape and I saw a car that seemed to be held together by nothing but duct tape and chicken wire last time I was in Alabama I kid you not, the whole door PrinceBrightStar in chat says name speculation has always been a part of new console launches, remember the Nintendo On?
3754938	3759302	I do and I remember when they were just going to call it Nintendo or Revolution, remember that?
3760154	3762217	Well, technically it was called Revolution.
3762257	3764099	It was their codename for it.
3764140	3764941	Just like Dolphin.
3764961	3766983	Should have been Dolphin.
3767044	3767404	Dolphin!
3769587	3771069	That should be just a commercial.
3775755	3779296	And then Tyra Banks screaming and running from the dolphin.
3779676	3785257	Just to go back to chat, we're talking about Midna's new litter box being an Xbox lube.
3785898	3791799	The thing is, is that if we got one of those, Dan would put it on the shelf and Midna would try to take over it and sit on it.
3792219	3793900	Because that's what she does with our current Xbox.
3793960	3795160	That's what video game systems are.
3795180	3795520	They're catapults.
3796000	3803246	We have a black shelf and a black Xbox and my black cat sits right next to the Xbox when she's trying to blend in and hide from people.
3803326	3805868	It is the funniest thing because you, where's the cat, where's the cat, where's the cat?
3806128	3807069	Green eyes, there's the cat.
3807530	3808530	The Xbox is just on.
3809091	3810372	Fusing with the Xbox.
3810732	3810992	Nice.
3811132	3811792	All right, let's move on.
3811832	3812092	Loki.
3812192	3812433	All right.
3812813	3819654	So there's yet another rumor about a set-tops box version of the next Xbox.
3820115	3826616	And, you know, this kind of goes back to the rumors where they were saying that, you know, there's going to be two different types of Xbox systems.
3826636	3835699	There's going to be one that's kind of like an Apple TV or, you know, something that's basically connected to the Internet always, but it has no actual, you know, media drives or anything like that.
3836119	3839840	It's mainly meant for, like, streaming and, you know, Xbox Live Arcade and...
3841141	3853790	This is actually coming from an anonymous source that told the Wall Street Journal that this Xbox TV thing is in the works and...
3855962	3856442	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3875628	3885114	For people that don't necessarily game on the Xbox, or if you are gaming on the Xbox, the other half of your time is probably watching Netflix or Hulu or something like that.
3885634	3889216	So it would make sense that they're trying to integrate it even more.
3891738	3900863	Every Xbox, though, that's come out, they've had this advertisement for linking your TV shows and making it a hub for all of your entertainment.
3900883	3902764	It wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being accurate.
3903189	3908892	I don't mind the way they've got it right now, but I don't like having to launch separate programs for everything.
3908912	3912474	I just kind of want it as like channels almost, if that makes sense.
3912674	3924200	You know, just like, okay, I need to watch, you know, or kind of like how they do it, I guess, on the Wii U with the TV is, you know, okay, I want to watch...
3925902	3927023	The Simpsons, or something.
3927103	3939053	And then it's like, okay, The Simpsons are on Netflix, on Hulu, and on Fox right now, or on Amazon, and you can pick where you want to stream that shit from instead of having to figure out, okay, well, I've got to go on Hulu.
3939153	3939853	Oh, shit, it's not on here.
3939893	3940874	Oh, I've got to go on Netflix.
3940974	3941575	Oh, it's not on here.
3941735	3942996	Oh, I've got to go here.
3943156	3950422	It'll just show you where it's at and where you can find it, or if it's on TV right then, or you can maybe go one step further and say, okay, I want DVR that.
3950442	3952704	Did they integrate Netflix into TV, finally?
3953425	3953725	I don't know.
3975425	4002508	going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Ranma says Xbox TV just like Apple TV but cheaper and less uppity hey well it might not be cheaper either Apple TV is pretty fucking cheap 99 bucks now you know what though you can just have a computer yeah build a $99 computer or just get somebody's old PC that they're not using or get one at a thrift store as long as it'll go online it works
4002901	4004142	It's just not as sexy, though.
4005123	4005804	Mine's pretty sexy.
4006725	4011850	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom confirming, yes, they did with the integration with Netflix on TV.
4012150	4014332	They've also recently integrated Hulu Plus.
4014772	4016174	I'm pretty sure on that last one, at least.
4017717	4025970	Yeah, I just had to look it up because we're having a seminar this week about video streaming and what it means for our business.
4026090	4029936	Basically a bunch of people are going to be saying, Oh, it's so difficult.
4029996	4030777	Don't worry.
4031378	4032139	Don't worry.
4032179	4033321	You can still sell movies.
4034662	4036563	XSEED Games, Pandora's Tower, Xenoblade
4056673	4061958	Well, XSEED purchased Atlas Online, and Atlas, of course, did what, like Disgaea?
4062078	4062898	Don't they publish that?
4062979	4065140	And, you know, they do a lot of those publishings.
4065561	4069044	I think Atlas Online's a separate entity from... Oh!
4069804	4070325	Herp Derp.
4070525	4070865	Well, good.
4070885	4071866	I'm glad you clarified that.
4071926	4073648	But Atlas Online... Ranma said Wild Arms.
4074448	4081912	Ah, Atlas Online has been purchased by XSEED Games, and they've now formed a new name.
4081992	4083052	So you're not going to hear this anymore.
4083072	4084913	You're going to hear Marvelous USA.
4085313	4090736	They'll be based in Irvine, and it's going to be all the employees from the former XSEED Game teams.
4090976	4095938	And with Atlas Online, I see, because it's going to be about enhancing mobile and online game markets.
4095998	4101701	So it's kind of more about rounding themselves out so that probably you could see like a Pandora's Tower, like iPhone game and so forth.
4101741	4103422	Okay, so this has nothing to do with this guy, am I right?
4103422	4108570	The next Suda51 game, they've got... Was it Killer is Dead?
4108891	4112457	Is their next big kind of multi-platform release.
4114676	4115617	All right, well, very cool.
4116457	4126023	You know, it's not like... These are two kind of smaller-ish companies joining together to try and step it up and compete more with the big guys like EA and so forth.
4126063	4127103	So this is kind of neat.
4127524	4130105	It doesn't sound like there was job loss that came out of it, so great.
4131086	4131726	All right, let's move on.
4133047	4140371	Well, in other news, we have, well, some very interesting news coming out for EA.
4140671	4141192	They have...
4143851	4164145	A FIFA exclusive license until 2022 Which I guess they're not hurting all that much if they're getting the FIFA games That's including the FIFA World Cup game and everything under EA Sports for the FIFA branding Also now, and this is the kicker, I would say
4165726	4175909	Disney is giving EA a Star Wars game agreement exclusive licensing for all of the Star Wars characters and storylines.
4176149	4186152	EA is going to develop and publish the new titles for a core gaming audience over all interactive platforms and the most popular game genres.
4186892	4190813	Disney is retaining the rights to develop new titles with mobile, social, tablet, and online gaming.
4192173	4201118	So, Disney, thank you for killing the Star Wars franchise by putting it in EA's hands.
4201218	4206201	They're going to rush everything out and give us shitty endings and change the writing halfway through the story.
4239200	4239701	You know what?
4241342	4241822	You might laugh.
4242783	4246365	EA owns your ass right now.
4247046	4251029	Coming to wreck all your favorite games.
4252209	4255872	Hey, I look forward to Star Wars, FIFA, soccer.
4256232	4256712	You know what?
4257233	4259735	I was going to use this as my wedding march.
4261796	4263037	Had we not gone to the courthouse.
4265559	4267340	You were going to literally walk down the aisle to this?
4268982	4269322	I was.
4269883	4270063	Yeah?
4270363	4270684	You know what?
4270724	4271865	I was going to walk down the aisle, too.
4271885	4273306	Tiara walked down to Doctor Who stuff.
4273647	4277531	Because... No, she walked down to the Star Trek The Next Generation opening.
4278331	4283056	Now, I know it sounds weird to hear me talking about walking down the aisle, but you have to realize in a gay wedding it'll be a little bit different.
4283296	4284678	But I already have my song picked out.
4292873	4295856	I just wish that we had a webcam on when you were playing Just Dance ABBA.
4316404	4317165	I'm glad we didn't.
4317346	4320269	Because that was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.
4320289	4323774	I inadvertently had to walk down the aisle to the song Week.
4325994	4326734	I don't remember that.
4326834	4328455	I remember your end.
4328495	4329215	Yes, you should have.
4329535	4331976	Remember the DJ that was absolutely terrible?
4331996	4332596	That DJ was horrible.
4332636	4333816	He played the wrong song.
4333856	4337438	When you walked out, okay, not the aisle, but when you were introduced.
4337818	4338278	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4338958	4339438	No, no, no.
4339478	4347761	When we first walked out, when we walked in the aisle, it was supposed to be, I think it was supposed to be Sunrise Sunset, I think it was supposed to be what they were going to be rocking down there.
4347781	4348601	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4348621	4351282	And then it ended up being like Week or something.
4351342	4353842	I'm like, what the hell are you playing?
4354923	4355263	Nice.
4356890	4358751	I have to say that your wedding was pretty fun.
4359752	4366035	And I will say that Chris Brown song that you have everybody dancing to, that's banned.
4366415	4368176	You will not hear that goddamn song at my wedding.
4370494	4370794	All right.
4371815	4377561	Anyway, Ranma in chat says, Rob Roberts is going to walk down the aisle to its reigning men or something by the Spice Girls.
4377601	4377761	No.
4377821	4379442	How gay do you think I am?
4380003	4380423	No.
4380744	4381364	Spice Girls?
4382165	4382746	That's totally you.
4383146	4385729	I mean, then again, I am talking about walking down to ABBA, but that's different.
4385829	4387190	That's classic ABBA.
4387370	4388331	Abba is classic.
4388411	4388831	That's right.
4389591	4391632	Spice Girls is getting pretty classic too.
4391813	4395174	I'll tell you what, if you want to class it up a bit, get lucky.
4395435	4396935	You just need to walk down and get lucky.
4397476	4398036	That's it.
4398116	4400718	It's not even really walking out, it's more strutting at that point.
4400938	4402959	I'll just walk down to the music from Tron.
4405609	4406829	No, no, no, no, no.
4406989	4407990	The game has changed.
4408170	4414952	No, you have to do the Wendy Carlos Tron soundtrack.
4415452	4416472	Oh, no.
4417353	4418013	No, no, no.
4418153	4419253	And we'll have blue lights everywhere.
4419513	4419833	All right.
4419953	4422534	Anyway, somehow we went from Star Wars to weddings.
4422754	4423755	But all right.
4423795	4425275	So Loki doesn't think this is such a big deal.
4425615	4426035	You know what?
4426075	4427936	The Star Wars games lately have been so bad.
4428936	4432679	What was the last time there was a good Star Wars game?
4432699	4433259	Super Star Wars.
4433800	4436141	Granted, The Old Republic, I didn't hate it.
4437362	4439163	I just think it was a better single-player game.
4440264	4444167	And some of the MMO aspects didn't work out so well and kind of flopsied.
4445187	4448449	But I can't stop thinking about that Star Wars Connect game.
4448489	4449210	It was so bad.
4449250	4450791	Okay, well, that was really terrible.
4450811	4453133	What about before that, The Force Unleashed?
4453753	4455454	I think some people liked the first one.
4457495	4458276	It was supposed to be all right.
4458616	4459437	Oh, Alan's here.
4459697	4462300	Are you going to comment further on my music choices, Alan?
4462700	4463761	No, just Star Wars games.
4464382	4468085	Force Unleashed, I thought, was pretty good, even if the first one wasn't quite finished.
4468706	4469707	And Jedi Academy.
4470027	4471288	Jedi Academy 2, I love that game.
4471308	4472149	I'd love to see a third one.
4473226	4477488	I remember Dan playing through Rogue Squadron, and that seemed pretty neat.
4477728	4479788	No more Star Wars characters in Soul Calibur, though.
4479828	4480429	You can bet that.
4481389	4481949	That's done.
4483170	4484650	You know what?
4484670	4485531	That was a mistake.
4486911	4487591	I liked it.
4487931	4489612	Starkiller was an awesome character.
4489912	4491193	Not so much the Yoda and Vader.
4491693	4493794	Starkiller made a great character in Soul Calibur.
4495114	4496995	Maybe we'll get another Marvel fighting game from EA.
4497557	4498478	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC
4520461	4527444	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, damage.
4528824	4529565	Well, that was short.
4529925	4530045	Yep.
4530265	4532926	We've had a lot of weeks of just, like, nothing lately.
4533106	4533986	It'll pick up a little bit.
4534006	4534646	Everyone's sleeping.
4536127	4539048	Especially with summer coming up, you would think... I wish I was sleeping right now.
4539528	4540549	I'm usually dead, though.
4541482	4545726	Well, aren't there usually like a bunch like late May, early June, like right when the kids get out of school?
4545746	4548809	There used to be a bunch late in June, but it's not the case this year.
4549790	4550131	Interesting.
4550751	4553074	Traveling over to Japan and checking out what is coming out over there.
4553294	4554936	I know we've talked about this series before.
4555096	4557398	Muv Love, Alternative, Total Eclipse.
4558819	4560321	I know we've talked about this before.
4560721	4563464	Isn't it like an anime or something we finally figured out is what it's about?
4563484	4565466	I thought it was like a girl groping game or something.
4565646	4569210	It sure looks like it when you see pictures like that.
4569490	4572113	When they don't show the guy's face, you know it's porn.
4572133	4573694	There's some muv love going on there.
4575556	4576517	and then MechWarriors.
4576897	4579039	It's like based on an anime or something.
4579079	4580480	I think somebody had to educate us on this.
4580500	4581641	That's all the animes.
4581681	4582221	You know what?
4582261	4584623	Like Scantily Cloud Women and Mechs.
4584883	4588485	That's all the games in Japan that don't come out over here.
4588726	4589506	Unless it's Rayearth.
4590067	4591968	And honestly, I have no problem with that.
4592028	4593189	I mean, because that's pretty awesome.
4593209	4594009	Mechs are awesome.
4594049	4595671	Women are awesome.
4595851	4598372	Bob Coffee in chat says it's a visual novel.
4599093	4600814	Visual novel's not so awesome.
4601835	4602155	Stop.
4602656	4602736	Uh...
4603496	4606838	On the Xbox 360, also, uh, MovLove is there as well.
4606878	4610821	By the way, that's in regular, limited edition, and Famitsu Deluxe Pack.
4612361	4614463	I'm assuming Famitsu's gonna give it a 40, right?
4614763	4615263	No, probably not.
4616024	4617485	Uh, moving on to the PlayStation Vita.
4617665	4620266	Nothing this week, but there will be a new BlazBlue pretty soon.
4620306	4621227	Or is that a price reduction?
4621887	4622988	Oh, sorry, that's a price reduction.
4623254	4624955	Why can't we get any more Tokimeki?
4625435	4625735	You know?
4625975	4627256	Good old-fashioned dating sims.
4627276	4628456	You should write your congressperson.
4628676	4631238	They have visual novels coming out from AXIS Games.
4631338	4638801	It's more of the... I don't remember which series it is now, but they've done a couple on PSP and they keep putting them out on PSP.
4639601	4645404	Rama from our friends at Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays on VOG, says, Loki, you shut your whore mouth.
4645504	4647305	Not all anime is boobs and ass.
4648765	4649606	All the good ones, though.
4652045	4655555	Hey, there's lots of good anime out there that isn't boobs and ass.
4656056	4656818	Like Pokemon.
4656839	4658483	I didn't say it was all boobs and ass.
4658624	4660429	I said it was boobs and ass and mechs.
4662160	4662741	Summon Knight 5
4691041	4692202	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4711636	4712276	They have crumpets.
4712376	4712716	No, I'm kidding.
4713277	4714117	Well, yeah, they do, but still.
4714958	4717619	On the 14th of May, we have Dust 514.
4718100	4721842	On the 15th, we have Sanctum 2 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360.
4722462	4728426	On the 16th, Frozen sign-ups for iPad and the Starship Damre on 3DS.
4728886	4734150	And on the 17th, Metro Last Delight for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4735010	4736131	And that is all.
4737168	4740032	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4740092	4741033	But first, Loki.
4741493	4743015	Alright.
4743195	4744297	So, Silicon Knights.
4745398	4749984	You may remember them for Too Human and a bunch of other games.
4750064	4751305	I remember them for Too Human.
4751886	4752146	Well...
4752967	4756588	They have closed their doors, or closed their offices.
4756649	4761991	They have emptied out their offices and unloaded some of their properties.
4762511	4770374	In fact, unloading some assets from Eternal Darkness, I want to believe, to the Shadows of the Eternal Kickstarter there.
4770794	4772895	So they've actually got assets down for their new game.
4773295	4782801	And, um, they are still arguing with, uh, Epic Games over two humans still, if you can believe that.
4782881	4783861	I mean, how long ago?
4783881	4783861	2008?
4783901	4787303	I mean, jeez.
4788384	4789304	Give it up already.
4789324	4790305	You haven't won yet.
4791205	4792326	Oh, five whole years ago.
4792446	4792606	No.
4793266	4793467	Yeah.
4793787	4794387	Five whole years ago.
4794447	4800190	They're still fighting them, even though I remember the last thing that they... The last, uh...
4802072	4807277	I want to say the last settlement in the judgment was that they owed even more or something now.
4807837	4808237	I don't remember.
4809098	4817285	Yeah, $4.45 million going to Epic Games and still they're fighting it.
4822303	4822604	I don't know.
4837837	4847407	This is being made by BlueStacks, and you can play mobile games on your TV with this little device using the controller, an iPhone or an Android smartphone.
4847427	4853954	But here's where it's different than, say, the Ouya, which is probably the first thing that pops into your mind, which is very similar, or something like GameStick.
4855316	4857958	The subscription model is like Netflix here.
4858519	4858879	For $7 a month...
4860741	4862202	GameTap GameTap GameTap
4880857	4906080	So anyway, yeah, very interesting Also, if you pre-order the console this month, you get it for free As long as you are doing a paid subscription to the service There is no commitment or contract The only little catch is that you have to return the console If you cancel your service within one year But as long as you're willing to do, what, 12 payments of $7 You would get a year's worth of games in the console
4906300	4906820	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4923769	4924390	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4940510	4969876	but that's the only thing that seems kind of unappealing to me because if you really wanted to do that and I know that you can say the same argument about the OUYA and stuff but you can get like an HDMI cable for your phone for like less than 30 bucks and plug your phone into your TV but there's the whole fact that you get 500 games now Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Action 52 had 52 games in it and how many of those were good well but one of them wasn't Angry Birds
4972366	4979121	There might be a couple gems amongst, I'm sure, a lot of throwaway games here, but there might be some good stuff.
4979796	4980817	It's an interesting idea.
4984139	4987141	Do you think we're not that far away from Xbox or PlayStation?
4987341	4990364	Well, hell, PlayStation Plus is kind of like this.
4990384	4998769	They've been saying already that the new Xbox is going to be focusing a lot on free-to-play stuff.
4999530	5005874	Probably because it makes sense, because if free-to-play, you can avoid piracy, because who cares?
5006235	5009017	Pirate it, more copies are out there, and you make all your money in DLC.
5010637	5010998	I don't know.
5012698	5015099	It's all right if they don't make it ridiculous.
5015259	5015780	You know what I mean?
5016580	5016760	Right.
5018061	5018361	All right.
5018661	5028785	Well, let's take a trip back in time to a time when you didn't have any of this subscription fees to play a game or anything like that.
5028845	5030066	Unless you had Satellaview.
5030746	5031166	I guess.
5031226	5032947	But I think this game might go before that.
5032987	5033567	I don't know.
5033767	5035048	No, this came well after that.
5035228	5035468	Oh, okay.
5035488	5035568	Okay.
5035808	5041232	Well, we're going to take a trip back in time then just a little bit to a classic video game that DarkSakura has picked for us.
5041532	5047256	She's jumped into the vault and said, hey, ungrateful kids, play this game this week and respect gaming.
5047556	5048997	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5049277	5051859	I picked the Neon Genesis Evangelion game for Nintendo 64.
5053981	5078937	it actually out of all of those games that's come out like the Saturn games and the other ones this one has to probably be my favorite it was really fun as far as it going through the entire series with the various battles and everything it was based pretty directly on the TV series and actually went into events for End of Evangelion
5080158	5092630	So you had 13 missions that were basically focused on each of the angels going up to the... In fact, this scene that I've linked here is the Mission 12 where you go against the Ava series.
5093611	5100217	And then in 13 are the other... Yeah, I went up through 13 levels.
5100237	5100377	Okay.
5101278	5126969	so basically this is just a retelling of the series but it's one that you participate in you play as the various pilots in the game there's even like this one right here is probably my favorite part in the entire series where Asuka gets her big I'm gonna kick everybody's ass moment oh wait I'm no longer in a coma it was really really freaking well done for something on the Nintendo 64 I just had to say
5128807	5133330	So really, there's not that much to say about it.
5133490	5138253	It's that you basically control the weapons as they go.
5138553	5147039	You have cinematic attacks, you have actions, you have a different type of gameplay that goes through.
5147059	5150661	You're sort of in a 3D, 2D course where you can walk back and forth.
5151962	5156865	But it pretty much has to do with just pressing the right commands to do the cinematic attacks.
5157225	5179278	I mean that's really the basis of it and then in the end you have like a free-for-all you're still in that that 3d 2d sort of movie you can move more freely and that's used in missions 12 through 13 you also have parts that are outside the missions like a training mode that's called simulation you have
5181019	5181880	Thank you for watching!
5199583	5199943	Simple.
5201004	5202825	It's freaking Evangelion.
5202845	5204266	You're playing the episodes.
5205166	5207427	And this one, to me, was the best of them.
5208168	5215972	Just because it had more of that action element to it and less of the whole, as I was calling the Saturn ones, datesome Evangelion.
5216792	5219854	It's just a good game.
5220534	5222115	It was the best of the lot.
5222175	5226017	And I think that for anyone who's a fan of this series, you should definitely give it a try.
5226428	5228349	For a Nintendo 64 game, it looks really good, too.
5228449	5229089	It does.
5229309	5236793	This was, if I remember correctly, this is one of the games that was released during the later part of the Nintendo 64's life.
5237413	5244397	Because I remember, I think that I first played this when I had a Dreamcast.
5245617	5251280	I know that one of my friends bought this and that's how I played it, but this is on my list of things to eventually pick up.
5251360	5253361	It was a really, really fun game.
5254508	5263275	And, I mean, really, since it's Nintendo 64, I'm throwing it on the list because, I mean, I really can't say enough good things about it.
5263395	5269539	It may seem kind of, you know, dated now, but for its day, it was pretty nice graphics and really good gameplay.
5269559	5270240	It was very solid.
5271260	5272561	All right.
5272621	5272962	Is that it?
5273142	5273462	That it?
5273522	5273822	All right.
5273902	5278486	There it is, your classic game of the week for the Nintendo 64, Neon Genesis Evangelion.
5280160	5280460	Awesome.
5281001	5285424	Neat pick, because I don't know much about that series at all, but watching that YouTube, I was like, oh, this looks kind of fun.
5286024	5289647	All right, we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, there is plenty more news to come.
5289767	5293630	The Fugle Question of the Week, all about Zelda, in the spirit of our interview earlier tonight.
5294030	5295772	Your emails, and plenty more.
5295912	5301196	Your calls, too, when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, episode 504, right after this.
5308018	5311319	Hey everyone, I'm DJ Ranma S. I'm Ari Rockefeller.
5311899	5314579	And I'm Mako-chan with Anime Jam Session.
5314999	5317340	And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio.
5317600	5319240	The show where every gamer has a voice.
5319740	5327001	And I want to use my voice to tell you that I like video games because I can kill people and not have to worry about going to prison.
5327681	5328241	Wow.
5329922	5335583	I want to use my voice to tell you that Final Fantasy VII is the greatest Final Fantasy game of all time.
5335983	5337183	And it's not overrated.
5338129	5338709	Oh boy.
5339609	5346712	I want to use my voice to tell you that I would pay all my money for a Capcom fighting game crossover where no one pitches about the lineup.
5347112	5348132	Make a dream, Kenny.
5348912	5349513	Never happen.
5349873	5351533	I know, but I do like that.
5352133	5353454	It's a good idea.
5354314	5356675	Can we go get food now?
5357535	5358375	Fuck yes, I'm hungry.
5358615	5359936	Yeah, I kind of want the pink berry.
5360976	5362277	Mmm, pink berry.
5362797	5364137	Alright, just got here.
5364217	5364597	Peace.
5365398	5365638	See ya.
5368035	5371496	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 504 in progress.
5371896	5372636	I want Pete Berry now.
5372856	5376417	Loki wants to use his voice to tell you that animes with boobies are better.
5378777	5379617	I want Pete Berry now.
5380217	5381238	Everything with boobies is better.
5382038	5387339	You know, I can actually imagine a few things that putting boobs on would make it absolutely not better.
5388019	5389379	Could you imagine boobs with boobs?
5390239	5391019	That would be frightening.
5391139	5391659	Double boobs?
5392160	5392660	No, no, no, no.
5392740	5394080	Just boobs that have boobs.
5395031	5395451	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5422749	5426033	and so I was playing Mega Man the Power Battle this week.
5426393	5427254	It's kind of awesome.
5427394	5427895	Just saying.
5428615	5429056	You know what?
5429196	5429436	What?
5431999	5434742	I will check that out as well too.
5434882	5438566	I don't want to hear it about the whole you shouldn't support meme and piracy and all that.
5439467	5447052	I bought every single stinking Capcom Arcade bundle pack and every freaking... You supported Game Room.
5447272	5447432	Done.
5447472	5447873	Yeah, I did.
5447913	5448153	Look.
5448213	5449013	Yeah, exactly.
5449113	5451575	I eat up all that retro shit when they put it out.
5451635	5452976	Totally, totally, totally.
5453156	5460041	The Metal Slug games are actually super fun with the arcade, but Blazing Star... I told you how to get it to work, right?
5460782	5464985	You start the game, then you leave the game and go back into it, and then the arcade will work with it.
5465485	5465605	Oh.
5465866	5467006	It won't right when you start up.
5467026	5467647	Okay.
5468027	5468527	Beep Mania Beep Mania
5491004	5494546	You should make your joystick your scratch.
5495507	5496487	Just flick it with your hand.
5497528	5498288	It shouldn't be that hard.
5498328	5501290	I think it's just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
5502331	5502971	Yeah, I think so.
5504972	5508775	Alright, well anyway, we're going to get back into some news here.
5508855	5509815	Rapid Fire News.
5510136	5510616	So, Loki.
5511414	5511955	Thanks for watching!
5529875	5533177	So, they're trying to fix that.
5534558	5535658	So, we'll have to see later this week.
5535698	5538019	She makes for some interesting reads.
5539220	5541541	Also, they announced The Sims 4.
5542142	5545584	It's going to be coming next year on PC.
5546644	5551187	And it is going to be offline and single player.
5551707	5553788	They made sure to mention that.
5556493	5578226	and last but not least um you may remember you know such wonderful games getting rebooted like well Duke Nukem Forever maybe is not a good example but Rise of the Triad well now Shadow Warrior getting uh redone by uh Flying um what was it uh Flying Wild Hog um
5579587	5585752	They're the developer, and it's supposed to be published by Devolver Digital, which has done all sorts of awesome things.
5588842	5614800	I almost forgot about Shadow Warrior I love Shadow Warrior because it had a slightly better version of the build engine so you could do upstairs and downstairs because remember with the build engine you couldn't really create rooms like if you had an elevator or something like that you had to create a teleporter that would teleport you to a different room it was the limitations of the engine looks cool, I can't wait
5615321	5622193	Going back to the SimCity stories for a minute here at our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, DungeonBuster says, great, another traffic fix.
5622253	5624458	Haven't they had to fix the traffic in like every single patch?
5624478	5625259	They're doing something to it?
5625680	5626321	Yeah, they have.
5626862	5627022	And...
5630405	5631205	It just hasn't worked.
5631266	5633006	Well, you know, traffic is a serious problem.
5633086	5637068	It's not, you know, if you can fix traffic that easy, LA would have it figured out by now, right?
5637088	5641671	Well, remember the last time they tried it, the last patch, like, fucked up sewage or something like that.
5642391	5645513	I'm sure it'll get taken apart once they put it out.
5645833	5649335	Also, forgot to mention that SimCity has reached 1.6 million in sales.
5649995	5655858	50% of that were online, so that's not surprising, I think.
5656348	5673978	considering them if you think about considering that you know I don't know a lot of people purchase PC games online nowadays speaking of traffic just totally random aside question I heard this on the radio the other day obviously LA is the worst city in the nation for traffic but do you know what the number two city in the nation is Atlanta Georgia
5675089	5676130	It is not Atlanta, Georgia.
5677030	5679331	Have you ever been in Atlanta driving?
5679531	5683233	I'm telling you it was not ranked number... It might have been number three, I don't know, but it was not number two.
5683413	5685854	And it was not Sacramento and it's not San Francisco.
5685874	5686494	San Francisco on game day?
5686514	5687535	Nope, it's not San Francisco either.
5688175	5691036	Honolulu, second worst city for traffic.
5691877	5699460	Which is interesting, but I guess when you think it's kind of all by itself out there and if they didn't build it right the first time, there's not a lot of other places to build.
5700020	5700541	Makes sense.
5701281	5701561	All right.
5702522	5702882	Anyhow...
5703903	5705586	Actually, I do have to agree with Prince Brightstar.
5705646	5706788	Boston is pretty bad.
5706828	5708210	Boston is very bad.
5708330	5711595	Seriously, Atlanta is the worst traffic I have ever been in.
5711675	5713217	Bobby, is Atlanta the worst?
5713377	5713998	Yes or no?
5714519	5715961	No, it's really bad.
5716222	5717784	It's really, really bad.
5718345	5718645	All right.
5720506	5724687	Let me move on to some Nintendo-focused stories here.
5724967	5727047	First one is about Super Mario RPG.
5727427	5731608	Super Mario RPG is going to be a reward for Club Nintendo members.
5732148	5738489	You can get that on the Wii Virtual Console for 200 coins if you are a Club Nintendo member.
5739009	5744610	That's on the Wii Virtual Console, not Wii U. You can also get Maboshi's Arcade for WiiWare for $150.
5744650	5746971	3D Classics Excitebike for $150.
5747591	5748591	Wasn't that free at one point?
5749391	5752334	ArtStyleAquia for 100 coins.
5752374	5754635	That's on DSiWare on the 3DS.
5756497	5759479	That's a cool game that I really wish would have a sequel.
5760780	5761380	Modern RPG?
5761581	5762641	Oh yeah, absolutely.
5763822	5768526	You might have 150 extra coins to spare if you purchase Super Metroid using coins.
5768846	5786076	Nintendo in a very interesting move decided to refund people who bought Super Metroid using 150 coins because of the 30 cent promotion coming up on Wii U they decided to refund the coins how kind that is actually a very nice thing to do because I would have thought people just should have been smarter and known that that was coming
5787441	5787902	Super Metroid E3
5803844	5805466	This is really no surprise at all.
5805626	5811310	Reggie Fils-Aimé and Shigeru Miyamoto are going to be hosting the pre-E3 presentation.
5811650	5812751	I mean, duh, right?
5812791	5814793	Those are the big personalities at Nintendo.
5814813	5820417	The biggest shock is that they say presentation, not a million presentations.
5821658	5824220	Well, but there could still be future ones done by others.
5824260	5826882	I mean, it's not always just the two of them in the videos.
5827082	5828644	I've seen plenty of other people in there, so...
5829324	5833509	The presentation will be to selected media and it's going to take place before the show floor opens to the public.
5849246	5853470	Once the presentation is over, members of the press gets to test out the titles before anyone else.
5854391	5855892	That's what they're doing.
5856252	5857893	They've already announced that's what they were doing.
5857913	5860656	But I'm saying that Reggie Fils-Aimé and Miyamoto are hosting it.
5861336	5861816	Well, cool.
5862377	5863638	Which is no surprise, I'm sure.
5863798	5864699	I'm sure his body's ready.
5867281	5868342	I wish I could get in.
5868362	5868702	Me too.
5868762	5869863	I want my body to be ready.
5870143	5871164	Alright, DarkSakura.
5873606	5875868	Sorry, I was complaining about Florida Cops.
5877602	5880425	Um, apologies to any of our listeners who is cop in Florida.
5880465	5881707	I know you are not all assholes.
5882808	5883048	Okay.
5883729	5893700	So, uh, coming to the 3DS eShop is a, uh, Summit Hedgehog, which is good news for everybody who is interested in playing that on your, uh,
5895009	5895729	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5926756	5944487	and then last but not least GameStop is not going to be taking PS2 trade-ins anymore even though they will still be selling the games as of June 1st they will not accept the console or related products for trade assholes
5946742	5948284	They're very excited about the PS4.
5948504	5949625	Let's be real, though.
5949705	5952027	I mean, it's not so much that they're assholes.
5952047	5952707	I mean, they are assholes.
5952727	5953748	They just need the shelf space.
5953788	5954969	But not because of this, yeah.
5955129	5955429	Yeah.
5956530	5956851	No.
5957311	5966038	I think that they're missing out on a market, or they're going to be closing off an area of revenue, but I think they're... I don't know.
5966078	5966979	I just don't think it's very wise.
5967745	5968786	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5988675	5990818	which makes me wonder how old most of those pictures are.
5991979	5992459	Go figure.
5993180	5993481	All right.
5993521	5999007	Well, if that does it for DarkSakura's rapid-fire news, then we're going to go to the foogle question of the week.
5999247	6000168	I rapid-fired that.
6002050	6003092	That's not the right theme song.
6003112	6003532	What are you doing?
6004013	6004794	Jeez, Rab.
6011277	6013899	Facebook.com slash Orange Sounds Radio or Google Plus.
6014019	6016281	Slam those words together, you get Fugle Plus.
6016561	6018162	But it's Fugle.
6018262	6025428	Tonight on Fugle, we plugged the interview we had in our first half with Joe, the creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone, the movie.
6026008	6033273	And we thought, you know, since this was a documentary all about The Legend of Zelda, we're going to ask our listeners this week, what's your favorite memory of The Legend of Zelda series?
6033694	6037256	This could be something that happened in the game or a memory you have about playing it.
6037296	6038397	We want to leave it wide open.
6038417	6040679	So let's go to some of the answers on Facebook first.
6041119	6044942	We'll start with Jeremy from the Koopa Club podcast.
6044962	6045383	I like them.
6045403	6045803	They're fun.
6046744	6053389	One of my biggest and happiest memories from childhood was playing the original NES Legend of Zelda with my older brother and sister.
6053909	6061175	We are not what I'd call a close family, and we don't really have much in common, but that game brought us all together, as hokey as it sounds.
6061695	6065598	Exploring the dungeons, bombing every wall, trying to burn every bush.
6066019	6068400	It was an amazing experience for me as a five-year-old.
6069801	6075405	I remember going around trying to set every single bush on fire in the game because you want to see if there's any more secrets.
6076265	6077186	Did you do that, DarkSakura?
6077206	6078326	Did you set everything on fire?
6078626	6085090	Oh, I did, and I bombed everything, and I tried to grab every single rock possible, and I would bomb every wall.
6085170	6088392	I would run into every wall in a dungeon to see if I could walk through it.
6088732	6089292	I know, cool story
6107160	6107861	and I'll see you next time.
6122734	6123835	and Anticipation.
6124456	6125017	Do you remember this?
6125197	6125517	Yeah.
6125597	6128020	It was the little drawing game that was the board game.
6128080	6128701	I remember it.
6128861	6133467	And they draw the little pictures and my mom would just sit back in the chair and go, it's a trumpet.
6134608	6136030	Rob, buzz in, it's a trumpet.
6136911	6137852	It's a trumpet, Rob.
6139557	6140177	Thank you for watching!
6162243	6164644	Back to the Facebook question of the week, Google question of the week.
6165104	6172366	XLink says, The first time playing Legend of Zelda, for the first time it came out, after it came out, and trying to help my friend beat the game.
6173106	6176566	Playing it for hours on end, going through and trying to find all of the dungeons.
6176906	6179467	Called the Nintendo Power Hotline just to get help for it.
6179607	6181467	And yes, my mother gave the okay for it.
6181908	6184428	Thus why I have the name Link for my handle.
6184568	6186348	Although the XLink is a different story.
6186389	6188389	Well, I never knew that the Link part of that came from Zelda.
6188869	6191130	Remember when you had to get permission to call the tip line?
6191671	6192811	I never got... I never did.
6192831	6198094	Yeah, I never... Well... We had some long-distance phone bills at my house.
6198494	6201016	I never got said permission from my mom.
6201076	6204497	And so, you know, it was like, Rob, you are not calling Washington.
6204758	6206298	You don't need to figure it out.
6206699	6207979	You can figure it out, Rob.
6208019	6210461	I'd be like, Grandma, I'm calling that Nintendo line.
6210701	6211721	Why don't you write them a letter?
6211741	6213982	You only can talk to them for 10 minutes.
6215763	6219865	That was seriously, I have to, I need to actually talk to my mom so I have my accent.
6220845	6223386	You only got 10 minutes to talk to those people and then you gotta hang up.
6223406	6225067	I don't care if they're halfway through conversation.
6226208	6226608	Yes, ma'am.
6226968	6232130	I did get permission later on to call the official Sierra bulletin board system, which was a long distance call.
6232170	6235191	So I could download like King's Quest demos or something.
6235211	6236172	Alright, anyway.
6237512	6239014	Back to Fugle.
6239574	6244740	And Matt J on Facebook says, The Zelda series, along with Metroid, has always held a special place in my heart.
6245040	6247503	The first Zelda title I ever played was A Link to the Past.
6247723	6250726	It, along with Super Metroid, cemented my love of gaming.
6251487	6251607	Um...
6252808	6254229	One of my greatest summers as a child was 1995.
6255209	6259932	Me and my two best friends at the time played through several SNES titles, A Link to the Past and Super Metroid.
6260372	6263574	I remember many a summer day playing through A Link to the Past with them.
6263954	6267016	Yes, it was a single player title, but it felt like we were playing it together.
6267296	6271498	We would all huddle around my friend's small black and white TV volume blaring as we went through the game.
6271778	6272138	DarkSakura.com
6296520	6297821	That's a really good story.
6298281	6302183	I got a little, like for real, I got a little, little verklempt hearing that story.
6302343	6303544	Are you talking amongst yourself?
6304144	6304664	I might be.
6306185	6314009	Well, you know, there's actually a bunch of chat going on right now about, you know, everyone's big retro games, you know, playing with their parents.
6314909	6319412	And I was actually just recalling the cutthroat games my mother and I would have with Dr. Mario.
6320752	6322013	Cutthroat games.
6322293	6324074	She would get mad.
6325894	6326855	I think you're cheating.
6327435	6330836	That's cool that you could play those games because my mom would only play the game show stuff.
6330856	6335378	And on Commodore 64, she would play Jeopardy and Family Feud with me.
6335858	6336638	But that's really it.
6337179	6344301	But anyway, that was really... It's kind of sad the way... Sadly, I've long since lost touch with my two friends, but the memories will never die.
6344621	6348663	Like, I just want to, like, play that song that'll take you back to that summer.
6348703	6349063	Like, it just...
6356325	6359247	I'm leaving.
6359327	6361929	I'm just going to walk through the football field and pump my fist.
6362009	6363290	Yeah, I just began it.
6366813	6367053	Anyway.
6368065	6396820	back to more Facebook answers on James S on the Fugo question of the week says being six years old and finally completing a link to the past from start to finish without a guide mind you was one of my favorite childhood memories it took it took my grandmother and my cousins about a year to finish it to this day I still play through it once every few years just to try and recapture that same magic from all those years ago there's only one other game that holds the same magic and memories for me and that's Illusion of Gaia they just don't make them like they used to hey guys ain't that the truth
6401425	6405889	Did you play through any adventure games or was it just the competitive stuff that you played with your mom?
6407150	6413815	Well, my mom really liked playing Super Mario Brothers a lot to the point where I would be chased out of my own room.
6415217	6422763	But she wasn't really into like Zelda or anything like that and when I borrowed my friend's, by borrow I mean, I borrowed it and he moved.
6423764	6424084	Copy?
6424404	6424945	It's not yours.
6425625	6427747	Yeah, well that's also how I acquired my Chrono Trigger.
6427987	6428427	Thanks for watching!
6448876	6449356	Win, lose, or draw.
6470762	6474683	They're making Draw Something into a game show, which is the same thing.
6474823	6479264	I know, but Draw Something is actually pretty... But it doesn't have Burt Reynolds and Burt Conroy?
6479404	6480664	Convoy?
6480784	6481164	Conroy.
6481205	6484245	Well, it's just like how they made Words with Friends into a board game.
6485906	6487526	Or Bejeweled into a board game.
6487606	6489066	Fuck, I just will play Scrabble.
6490087	6491327	Which was also a great game show.
6492586	6494247	You know what actually was also a good game show?
6494648	6495228	Bumpers Stumpers.
6495649	6497210	That was a great game show on USA.
6497230	6497831	Chuck Woolery.
6497931	6498411	I sure do.
6498471	6499773	Chuck Woolery is the man.
6500033	6502255	It was on USA just before up all night.
6502355	6502616	All right.
6502856	6507260	Haseo Surumogawa says, beating the water temple without help when I was 10.
6508905	6512509	Wicked says, not a specific memory in-game, but an entire game itself.
6512609	6514230	Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past.
6514571	6522358	It took every single thing that made the first Legend of Zelda good, multiplied it by ten, then took everything I felt was bad in it and nullified it.
6522799	6524881	There was no bad in the original Legend of Zelda.
6524901	6525461	What's wrong with you?
6525501	6525962	I'm just kidding.
6525982	6526642	Zelda 2, maybe.
6526702	6527363	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
6528104	6529425	I know people love Zelda 2, but...
6531112	6535274	The graphics were colorful, the music was orchestral, the control was tight, the design was brilliant.
6535694	6543016	Granted, I haven't played a Zelda game past Link's Awakening, but I have to say what I have played, A Link to the Past, is the greatest Zelda game ever made.
6543837	6549559	Ragenator says, My favorite memory is beating the first quest of the original Zelda game on the NES as a kid for the first time.
6550999	6580259	Andy R lastly on Facebook says when I was younger I really wanted Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons while I was visiting my grandmother my parents told me they'd buy me a game so off we went to the game store the whole way there I explained to my grandmother how there were two games and how they were related and such straight out of Nintendo Power I'm sure when we got there my parents told me they'd only buy me one of them I picked one and we went home that night I was playing it and my grandmother came over with a grin handed me the other game and told me to keep it a secret from my parents
6582901	6583761	I was so good.
6583781	6585042	I'm like choking here.
6585062	6586423	That's a great Mother's Day story.
6586783	6588665	My grandma bought me a Killer Instinct.
6591607	6592928	That explains a lot.
6593788	6600713	She took me to four different stores to buy Killer Instinct until we found it at Rest in Peace Montgomery Wards.
6601434	6615505	to be fair I had to no it wasn't my mom it was my dad my dad was the only one that would go to like software etc and all that with me so when like Mortal Kombat came out and all that and I pitched a fit until they gave me my CD you pitching a fit even younger girl
6617185	6619587	All right, let's go to Google+.
6619627	6622129	Just a couple answers over there, but the first one from Redertainment.
6622590	6625432	When we were kids, my sister and I both had our own Game Boys.
6625773	6627875	This was the original large black and white Game Boy.
6627935	6630697	My sister broke her Game Boy by hitting it while she was playing it.
6631017	6634360	My sister begged and pleaded with me to allow her to play with my Game Boy.
6634721	6639825	I said no because she broke hers, and I was sure she would break mine in the same way my sister broke hers.
6640926	6648851	After her typical high amount of whining and crying to my parents, my parents told me to let my sister play my Game Boy despite me being absolutely sure that she would break it.
6649312	6653234	My sister did end up breaking my Game Boy by hitting it as she was playing it.
6653674	6656136	She was playing Zelda Link's Awakening at the time.
6656516	6661759	This might not sound like a good memory, but it is because I was proven to be right and I like being right.
6662220	6665622	I especially like being right when my sister and my parents are wrong.
6669191	6669491	Love it.
6670552	6680179	And lastly, Flaco Jones saying, the ending to Link's Awakening was the best video game ending I have ever experienced to that point and still ranks up there with my favorite endings ever.
6680540	6685023	The Ballad of the Wind Fish just adds to it by being the most memorable Zelda game moment for me.
6686224	6714927	I read every answer tonight I shortened some of them a little bit for time but every answer if you want to see the complete answers facebook.com slash orange launch radio or google plus orange launch radio it's not too late to add your response either because the people that posted before will see it so great job tonight you guys I loved some of those stories the big memory ones about grandma and about the two friends you don't talk to anymore that got me in a special place it did alright you alright
6715647	6716767	I was thinking about my grandma.
6716927	6717248	Yeah.
6717988	6719028	You know what else she was responsible for?
6719068	6720709	Was this the same one who got you Killer Instinct?
6720929	6721249	Yes.
6721329	6721789	Oh, wow.
6721989	6724170	Well, I'll go ahead and just give the quick, quick story.
6724650	6740215	She's got a dead hip socket, had three strokes, and cerebral vasculitis, meaning that she has swelling in her arteries and veins and everything in her brain, and two aneurysms.
6741375	6768032	But this is, she, I talked to her the other day, she was just fine And I remember that she also, and I don't think she actually realized what she was getting me at the time But she also got me my Kirby's Avalanche Which, you know my love for all things Pio Pio She got me my entire collection of Red Hot Chili Peppers cassettes at the time Because I was super, super obsessed with Red Hot Chili Peppers Really?
6768052	6768132	Yeah
6768872	6775359	And then, you know, she put up with me, you know, blasting Radiohead at all hours of the night.
6775880	6776901	My grandmom is the best.
6777642	6782387	And she, she would always say that she was trying not to spoil me, but she did spoil me pretty bad.
6782908	6785311	And she took care of me when my mom moved to Arizona, so...
6786280	6787041	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6802219	6822551	and unfortunately not a lot of games from EA on the Wii U and it doesn't sound like that's going to be changing anytime soon because the brand new Frostbite 3 engine that they're going to be using for Battlefield 4 and I think I want to say a lot of the upcoming sports games, like they're going to be going with the Frostbite 3 engine.
6822591	6824252	And whatever the next Mass Effect is.
6825093	6831077	Yes, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, they will not run on the Wii U. So...
6833047	6833347	Uh-oh.
6833727	6834687	Yeah, that's not good.
6834927	6842289	And I think, I mean, you could say that they may be able to port it to Wii U if they created another engine that could ride it.
6842729	6849170	Maybe like an upgraded Frostbite 2 engine, kind of like how they do with some of the Unreal 3 stuff or whatever.
6850530	6852410	But is it really worth it to them?
6852610	6861192	I mean, they're just kind of saying, do we really want to put this much effort into creating a new engine to only sell like maybe 100,000 copies, if that?
6862352	6867074	Well, then, and I bet Mass Effect 3 didn't exactly sell very well, but it's because there wasn't 1 and 2.
6867915	6873277	Well, that and the whole preview, whatever the Genesis 2 was, was shit.
6874098	6874598	Utter shit.
6874878	6879140	Even if they just didn't have the gamepad functioning in 1 and 2, just poured them over.
6879240	6879601	God.
6880641	6885463	But I guess, you know, it's easier for me to sit here and say, just cram it from that box into that box.
6885604	6885904	Just cram it.
6886744	6915757	amp up the graphics in level 3 I'm sure they could have done that but I'm willing to bet a lot of the reasons why they don't have all games being ported over there is Nintendo probably requires a certain amount of connectivity with the gamepad and if they're saying okay listen you have to use the gamepad in some function that's probably why you see a lot of these games not getting Wii U ports YYR in chat needs some clarification are they developing the same engine for 360 and PS3 or is this for the next wait so a 360 it won't run on the Wii U
6916862	6918303	Converted Smartphone Games
6941343	6942943	Nintendo has offered professional use conversion software.
6961449	6967410	to certain app devs in the hopes that smartphone software could help boost the Wii U's sales figures.
6968031	6987895	I'm assuming that's just to kind of boost up some of the eShop content, which we've heard is very indie-friendly to begin with, but I'm not sure that alone is going to save the Wii U. I mean, granted, a robust downloadable title stuff will help tremendously, but it's not going to be one on those mobile games alone.
6988275	6990656	I think most people who want to play mobile phone games will get...
6991456	6992137	A mobile phone.
6993057	6994558	Or already have one.
6994778	6995659	That's right.
6996660	6997580	Or they'll get an OUYA.
6999081	6999942	Alright, moving on.
6999982	7000422	DarkSakura.
7001383	7002964	Well, we do have some news.
7003784	7008067	This is something that I thought was really cool and I'm going to be checking it out.
7008107	7009928	I haven't quite yet, but I've been reading up on it.
7010529	7019795	There is a game called GeoGuessr that basically uses Google Maps and it drops you in a location.
7020855	7025781	And you have only a few, you can go a few blocks, you can walk around.
7025881	7030646	It's sort of like you were, you know, kidnapped and got away and you have no fucking clue where you are.
7031446	7038193	So you use your clues around and you have a map and you can pick on the map where you are.
7039074	7040975	And the closer you get, the more points you get.
7041455	7042696	So you have five rounds.
7042836	7046337	And so by the end of it, you can share your scores with your friends.
7046477	7047418	You can be competitive.
7048878	7057342	And they actually are saying on the GeoGuessr Twitter that is working on other type of competitive play options
7058242	7085298	and uh like there's this one scene on here where it's just showing you know a plain road with a dirt around it and you have to figure out where you are so it's really sadly what most of it looks most of google maps looks like if you really think like that one that you're on right there that picture yeah to me that i would put that in uh on the stretch of uh between nevada and uh let me let me look at this really big here does it say where it's at
7085865	7086585	No, I don't think so.
7107492	7109617	That could just easily be I-5, honestly.
7109637	7110679	That could be I-5.
7110699	7111140	I don't know.
7111541	7115009	Too bad you don't have smell-o-vision, because if you smell cow death, you know you're on the I-5.
7116251	7117655	And you drive right past cowschwitz.
7118911	7120572	I like games out of Google Maps though.
7121173	7123255	Things like that, I like those little exploration games.
7123275	7124796	There's so much cool shit on Google Maps.
7124956	7132122	And to the Wii U's credit, that's one of the cool things I've enjoyed on the Wii U is that Google exploration thing where you can actually panorama around.
7132142	7133623	But you know what I would love to see?
7134323	7137286	Is a Google Maps integrated Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?
7137306	7138527	Now that's awesome.
7138547	7139648	Couldn't you see that?
7139748	7142970	And you have to do the shop view to see if she's inside a place.
7143030	7143631	Oh, that's rad.
7144331	7146013	Okay, don't steal my ideas.
7146033	7146473	Patent pending.
7146533	7147114	Patent pending.
7147174	7147755	Patent pending.
7148495	7149356	You heard it here first.
7149436	7151678	I'm going to be starting a Kickstarter tomorrow.
7153079	7153840	Except, wait a minute.
7153860	7154921	Hiring programmers.
7154981	7159625	You don't own Carmen Sandiego, so... I'll be like... I'm going to be the star.
7159645	7161067	I'll be where the fuck is Jamie now.
7162428	7162968	There you go.
7163269	7163769	There you go.
7164570	7166912	So... When in doubt, change the star to yourself.
7167032	7167392	Yeah.
7167492	7168153	Great logic.
7168673	7169674	Yeah, it'll be like...
7170826	7172528	We haven't had an OLR dream game in a while.
7172828	7175951	So that's our new dream game, Where the Fuck is Jamie?
7176031	7177372	Where the Fuck is Jamie Now?
7181435	7182216	What do you think, Loki?
7182296	7185058	If you were going to make this game realistic, it'd be in her pajamas at home.
7186960	7187881	I found her again.
7188281	7189222	She's in the same spot.
7189742	7191884	She's at 7-Eleven buying Guinness again.
7191924	7192845	Click, click.
7193425	7194106	No, no, no, no, no.
7194666	7195547	I live in Citrus Heights.
7195587	7196288	It's the Tower Mart.
7197549	7197929	Wait a minute.
7198069	7198990	She's at Disneyland.
7201528	7204357	She dragged Dan to a Starbucks saying, Coffee!
7204898	7207879	Prince, Brightstar in chat says needs a co-star Waldo type character.
7207899	7209459	Well, that would be me.
7232042	7232262	Oh, my God.
7254702	7255243	I need to go.
7255523	7256525	Oh, so good.
7256845	7257346	So good.
7257767	7258968	I just haven't been given a fuck.
7258988	7261432	We have itsits at my house in M&M's, which I brought some here.
7262033	7262493	All right, anyway.
7264917	7267841	Loki, you have something besides where the fuck is Jamie now?
7268669	7272932	Yes, let's talk about Google Play.
7273092	7275033	Going back to mobile phone games again.
7276754	7283319	Google Play Games is apparently something that leaked out thanks to the Android Police.
7283659	7284740	Yes, that's actually a website.
7285420	7311350	and it's from I guess a Play Services APK Teardown and what is Google Play Games well it's basically their version of Game Center it's got all sorts of wonderful features including you know in-game chat they're saying that cloud saves achievements leaderboards invites matchmaking lobbies all sorts of fun stuff and that will be coming I guess soon
7313138	7316359	Maybe they're saying that it could be revealed this week.
7316459	7317500	I guess Google's I.O.
7317520	7318800	event is this week.
7319800	7322902	It'd be interesting.
7322922	7328263	I would be kind of interested to see if they're going to translate this into almost like a console.
7330144	7332445	It'd be interesting.
7332585	7333365	Just what we need.
7333685	7334806	Another console.
7335026	7336186	We've already got the big three.
7336226	7337066	We've got the Ouya.
7337147	7339587	Now we just had a report on this mobile phone console.
7339967	7341148	There's too many consoles.
7342941	7344562	I do not want Google to make a console.
7344602	7346303	I want Google to team up with somebody else.
7347204	7348504	Which, who knows?
7348825	7350105	Could Microsoft team up with Google?
7350165	7351646	No, they're not really friends, right?
7352587	7354168	But then again, to take out Apple, they might.
7354268	7354608	Who knows?
7355188	7355509	I don't know.
7355549	7362393	There's that Apple-Google rivalry, I think, that they would form an axis to take down the mighty fruit.
7362713	7364634	You know, Apple hasn't announced anything in a while either.
7364654	7365515	It's been a very long time.
7365855	7366455	No new iPads.
7366475	7367176	They're taking a nap.
7367336	7367956	They're taking a nap.
7368076	7368557	A little nap?
7368877	7369417	A little napple?
7370037	7370358	A napple.
7372648	7372928	All right.
7373248	7377890	Well, we know that... And PrinceBrightStar in chat says, no love for PC.
7377990	7380411	Well, a PC... I don't know if that's in reference to what I said.
7380751	7382351	A PC, I don't really count as a console.
7382711	7385392	But obviously, yes, all these games go on PC, too.
7385472	7389394	I mean, there's some things you can only get on PC, like World of Warcraft.
7391840	7392300	PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7, PS8
7415039	7430014	Uh, Shuhei Yoshida, who is the president of Sony Worldwide Studios, noted in an interview with 4Gamer, which is a Japanese site, that the share button is limited to what developers will allow, which makes a lot of sense.
7430074	7432897	You don't necessarily want people to be able to share everything.
7433917	7455503	for example you can like on the Vita you can have certain scenes disable this so you could take a screenshot and the share function might share the screenshot but you might not be able to actually take a video of the entire final boss so you wouldn't be able to like share the ending of the game two hours after the game launches you know something like that so it makes sense
7456363	7481936	but what else I thought was interesting about the interview is that the video sharing function was inspired by the fact that Shuhei Yoshida wanted to play Dark Souls all day long so he would watch videos of other people playing the game since he was too busy and so that's where the share button came from so that Dark Souls 3 or whatever ends up on the PlayStation 4 he'll be able to use the share button to watch other people play
7483737	7485118	So he's a lawyer.
7485418	7486699	Maybe he likes to watch.
7487159	7487459	Ooh.
7488240	7490981	Well, he might like to watch, but we like to read.
7491542	7493063	And every week you guys email us.
7493763	7501528	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura ever so happily opens up the mailbag, dives in and finds a few emails to read for you.
7502748	7503169	Right now.
7503349	7503749	DarkSakura.
7503949	7504329	You know what?
7504450	7508592	Every time I look at the mailbag, Eddie Izzard's voice goes into my head going, It's all sticky!
7509893	7510013	So...
7511485	7512786	Hi, everyone at OLR.
7512806	7514667	This is your friendly neighborhood Ragenator.
7515368	7519331	Unfortunately, I do not have any gaming-related topics this week, but I do... Then bye.
7519631	7519911	Bye.
7519931	7520772	I'm just kidding.
7521893	7524375	But I do have some good news to geek out over.
7524495	7527517	You could... He's doing all this emphasis.
7528177	7530959	Like, you could just italics... Well, this thing doesn't read italics, does it?
7531320	7533801	You could say I have some perfect news.
7534342	7535643	As of 3.30 p.m.
7535783	7539586	EDT, on Friday, 5, 10, 13, I am the proud-as-hell cat owner...
7540206	7542868	Proud as all Hellcat owner, I saw your kitty and your kitty is cute.
7543009	7544630	I'm sorry, I was very busy when you messaged me.
7545411	7553878	I went to my local SPCA and adopted the most adorable two-year-old male cat that the SPCA named Anakin, who is mostly white with some black patches.
7554258	7556360	I swear, this cat's back looks like a Rorschach test.
7556820	7557281	It's awesome.
7557461	7558421	You should name him Rorschach.
7558942	7563846	But, you know, he might... You know... But when you beg him for mercy, he might say no.
7564146	7564527	I don't know.
7565247	7565688	He'll say meow.
7565768	7566208	Meow.
7566368	7566788	Meow.
7569720	7571601	He's extremely friendly and playful.
7571721	7576684	Granted, due to the new environment, he's been hiding under my bed for a while, but I'm sure he'll warm up to my place.
7576885	7577685	Smile, heart.
7578145	7587371	I haven't had the opportunity to take his picture yet and upload it yet, but I'm working on it and I hope he'll be comfortable enough around my place by Sunday evening when your show airs and you three take calls.
7588432	7591054	That way the three of you get to see him.
7591534	7593495	Now, I do like to propose a poll for your show.
7593615	7598477	Do I keep Anakin as a cat's name or do I name him after Booger, the character from Revenge of the Nerds movies?
7598937	7600078	I still think you should name him Rorschach.
7600558	7604079	We're not polling it because Anakin is a clear better name than Booger.
7605100	7605440	I don't know.
7605460	7606840	I had a friend that had a cat named Booger.
7606920	7610302	I told you about Dan's grandfather named his cats Hiss and Spit.
7611782	7613743	And then I had a friend in high school that had a cat named Bitch.
7616264	7618025	And then there's someone now who has a cat named Asshole.
7618919	7620280	But bitch is a dog.
7621541	7622221	Irony, Rob.
7622441	7622802	Irony.
7622922	7624363	It's very hipster, okay?
7625603	7626844	Now, Rob, I'll let you finish.
7628806	7632188	But I have to say that I have the greatest kitty ever.
7632608	7634709	This email was brought to you by Fuzzy Wuzzy Kitties.
7634910	7635550	No, you don't.
7635930	7636771	Come here, Sanrio.
7636851	7638532	Sanrio is under your bed.
7639284	7640465	Yeah, Sanrio hates people.
7640725	7642926	I love Midna so fucking much.
7643206	7644587	Midna is super fucking adorable.
7646008	7649310	You should just rename your Tumblr Fuck Yeah Midna because that's all it is.
7650611	7651631	It's not all it is.
7652072	7654133	You already have like seven Tumblr accounts.
7654193	7654833	What's one more?
7654893	7656034	You need a Fuck Yeah Midna.
7656174	7658035	I actually made one for one of the fanfics I'm writing.
7658675	7658936	See?
7659436	7661197	How many Tumblrs do you have?
7661621	7662642	I have... Fuck, hold on.
7662662	7663423	I have my main.
7663443	7664383	I have that one.
7664824	7668387	I have Sleepwaking, which is my art... I have an art history Tumblr.
7668847	7671089	I barely have enough shit to post to one Tumblr.
7671109	7671489	I have political.
7671509	7672470	I have mass affecting.
7672490	7673110	I have mass affecting.
7673170	7674111	I have one Tumblr.
7674592	7675292	HelloRobbie.
7675472	7677013	If you want to follow me on Tumblr, HelloRobbie.
7677594	7678355	R-O-B-B-I-E.
7678475	7678755	Doodle.
7678855	7679716	I have seven Tumblrs.
7680877	7681257	Do you really?
7681696	7682136	I really do.
7683497	7685359	I wasn't lying.
7685379	7687220	This is an intervention.
7687700	7688161	You know what?
7688181	7690262	Bite me.
7691483	7698528	I did my art history blog just because I know not everyone gives a shit about DeSteel and the Bauhaus movement.
7699348	7706753	So I made that one and then Mass Effect started taking over my main one so I made my Mass Effect blog and whatever.
7707054	7707534	Don't judge me.
7708935	7712859	Actdeft suggests name him Anagar, Anagan plus Booger.
7713239	7715221	You know, I think... Name him Rorschach.
7715601	7719945	Now, Alan obviously named the cats because they were already 10 years old by the time I got in the picture.
7720365	7724849	But I believed when Alan named Maruko, I think that was two things combined like that.
7725369	7726290	I think from what he told me.
7726671	7735358	Okay, and actually Queen Simia in chat says Holstein because he's colored like a cat.
7736607	7738848	Alright, next email.
7739188	7740748	Too many cats, not enough games.
7740848	7744470	Although, then again, there's no such thing as too many cats.
7744550	7745150	You know the rule.
7745930	7747511	The internet is made for cats.
7748291	7748871	And porn.
7749291	7749992	But mostly cats.
7750952	7751472	And porn.
7751912	7752292	Cats.
7753853	7754613	I see what you did there.
7755193	7755654	Cat porn?
7759397	7760038	I like pussy.
7761378	7763319	Don't get me started on the furry community.
7765260	7768061	I actually really like fursuiters.
7768181	7771202	I love the care and attention that go into the costumes.
7771723	7773183	There's just some art I don't need to see.
7773784	7774824	But they're welcome to draw it.
7775384	7776025	I just won't look at it.
7777545	7779186	That's my approach toward any fandom.
7779746	7781507	You can enjoy your fandom, enjoy your ship.
7781627	7782287	I don't have to look at it.
7782767	7783588	Don't get me wrong.
7783788	7784868	I like Muppets.
7785409	7788130	I just don't like Muppets, you know?
7788977	7791320	Trust me, if it exists, someone has slashed it.
7792221	7793103	This is the internet.
7794344	7795746	Okay.
7796087	7801153	This is from... I'm just going to say Sam because I don't sign it.
7801394	7802114	It's just Sam.
7803416	7804377	Hello, OLR crew.
7804478	7805178	I love the show.
7805199	7805739	Hi, Sam.
7805779	7806180	Thanks, Sam.
7807517	7809939	I think we have also made that point on the show, I do agree.
7829861	7832003	Just because you have a system don't mean people's gonna put shit on it.
7833143	7833564	In the story.
7834264	7835185	I ain't got time for that shit.
7836526	7837767	So, uh, last email?
7838948	7839148	Mm-hmm.
7840109	7845613	Hey, OLR crew, I wanted to tip my hat in along with Loki and Sky's complaints about Nintendo's game from episode 503.
7846693	7854960	Both of you brought up perfectly valid points, and I want to bring up an issue, too, namely with Nintendo not putting enough content in their games to make them feel, quote, complete.
7854980	7855380	Okay.
7855700	7861684	For example, Wii Sports Resort was touted to be a major upgrade from the first Wii Sports.
7862285	7870150	I don't own Wii Sports Resort, though after taking a look at the FAQ for it, I'm convinced it's just a small step up with all the new minigames included.
7870570	7885360	I understand Wii Sports and other Nintendo games that typically star Miis are intended for casual audiences, but why won't Nintendo put in effort to toss in features aside from online multiplayer, like your Mii having stats that affect gameplay or a complete fleshed out tournament mode?
7885780	7892849	Not only would these features appeal to core players, it would give the casuals a sense of progress and an enticing reason to come back to the game.
7900881	7928128	for real like I really wish Nintendo would it just pisses me off Nintendo needs to steal some people from Microsoft or even Sony that get online better that get the enhanced value of it it really it just pains me that Nintendo won't try to advance the social aspect of gaming online but then again they made buku bucks off of party games so you know what whatever works for them right
7929418	7935767	Well, it's also Nintendo, which I think still refuses to... It's like they put... We're not crossing the line.
7935787	7936368	We're not crossing the line.
7936488	7938211	We'll touch the line, but we aren't crossing it.
7939493	7940474	We do things our way.
7940734	7942116	We do things the Miyamoto way.
7944429	7949473	I also believe my beef with Nintendo applies to some of the flagship games too New Super Mario Bros.
7949593	7961502	U only unlocks one extra world after you beat the game whereas Super Mario 3D Land put up another 8 whole worlds that are substantially tougher substantially I'm all tongue tied
7962322	7967424	and how many people know that the upcoming Super Luigi U DLC only allows 100 seconds per stage?
7968025	7974328	Hearing that gives me the impression Nintendo is being cheap by not offering stages of standard length.
7975528	7976729	Well, we do like it long.
7978149	7980971	OLR Crew, please cheer me up by answering this question.
7981531	7984332	What are some of the games you've invested an assload of time into?
7985993	7987153	No, stay mad.
7988734	7989194	I'm just kidding.
7989254	7989575	I'll answer.
7989795	7990335	What's the rest of it?
7990802	7995367	I personally sunk somewhere over 2,000 hours into Phantasy Star Online a few years ago.
7996008	7999492	And more recently, I played The Binding of Isaac for over 600 hours.
8000013	8002095	Stay fresh, everyone, and don't be a cudwafter.
8003136	8004798	Spelled like the type that cows chew.
8004918	8005779	Yeah.
8005819	8006720	Cudwafter!
8006780	8007481	Cudwafter!
8007501	8009804	That's gonna be my favorite game name ever.
8010544	8011766	And that's from The Nasty Canasta.
8012306	8014567	Which is one of my favorite listener names, by the way.
8015708	8019089	Because I always just imagine a game of like strip canasta, like the card game.
8019109	8019429	But anyway.
8019789	8020710	Strip canasta?
8020730	8021990	Because it's nasty canasta.
8023611	8024351	You know the card game?
8024451	8025072	All right, forget it.
8025232	8025592	I know.
8026012	8026732	All right.
8028113	8029173	It's like dirty pinochle.
8029193	8030194	Pino, pinochle?
8036451	8040754	That's like your sister or brother would be a dirty pinochle.
8042936	8044917	Anyway, what was the question?
8044957	8045838	You didn't even ask for that.
8045938	8046838	Fuck, I just closed it.
8047459	8050561	Oh, what game have you... Sunk a lot of time into.
8050741	8054544	World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XI, and insert MMO here.
8054824	8058225	Mass Effect 3, a disgusting amount with a multiplayer, has really enhanced that.
8058245	8060265	I'm actually going to be starting over on the whole series again.
8060385	8070708	I am going to keep Dramamine by my computer and play through the first Mass Effect again because I love the story in it best of any of them, but I get so damn motion sick.
8071208	8073029	I turn off the film grain.
8073089	8076409	I turn off the wiggle, whatever, the motion blur.
8077070	8080050	Still get sicker than anything on the stupid Mako missions.
8080670	8081411	What about you, Loki?
8081911	8082511	Grand Theft Auto?
8083208	8095459	Grand Theft Auto, Earth Defense Force, Saints Row, and even Call of Duty because we played it for multiplayer, but I don't play a ton of that.
8097120	8098301	Probably Grand Theft Auto 4.
8098762	8099402	It's a lot of fun.
8099603	8099903	I don't know.
8101817	8109683	I actually, it's funny that I was talking to Dan about me playing Ragnarok Online 2 because, you know, he's like, well, you only played the first one for 10 years, which is true.
8111164	8111905	Something like that.
8111945	8128998	Well, I played Ragnarok Online since it was in the Japanese beta because I started playing in Japanese and then I moved over to IRO when they opened the beta here and then I played through paid IRO and then I went to free servers and
8129338	8134463	You know, I'm actually one of the few people that would still have my original account intact because I was a beta tester.
8135284	8135604	Oh, nice.
8135804	8135965	Yeah.
8136705	8138267	That was another one that ate a lot of my time.
8138707	8139348	Civilization 1.
8140129	8141950	I played a disgusting amount of that on PC.
8142151	8143372	I'm not surprised at all.
8143780	8144020	All right.
8144980	8145561	More emails?
8145681	8146081	Or was that it?
8146181	8146601	That was it.
8146761	8150722	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I can't believe I didn't even say this.
8151582	8155964	I would play Super Street Fighter 2 on my SNES like all the time.
8157124	8159345	I would have people over like, we're going to play games.
8159425	8160725	We're not playing Super Street Fighter 2.
8161105	8162246	It's like, okay, Kirby's Avalanche.
8162946	8165387	But those were my two SNES day.
8165707	8166207	Good times.
8167447	8167707	All right.
8167968	8168968	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
8185370	8186850	DarkSakura.
8189651	8194273	I have a few FUs because I have been carrying quite a bit of angst this past week.
8195233	8198194	FU number one goes to my stupid allergies.
8198454	8199914	I have developed a weed allergy.
8200654	8202335	And Dan brought me donuts last night.
8202415	8203475	And I was like, donuts?
8203515	8204655	I'll eat the hell out of those.
8204856	8205476	Nope, sick.
8206916	8209377	And then to plane ticket costs because...
8210057	8211458	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8233237	8234839	And then I was thinking, well, you know what?
8234939	8243028	If I stay a full two weeks, arrive on a Tuesday, leave on a Tuesday, yeah, that's going to be a lot better for my cost.
8243088	8243289	No.
8244029	8245211	I'm leaving on a Thursday.
8245271	8250216	If I stayed until Tuesday the following week, it would have bumped my ticket up by like another $150.
8251838	8252739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8268798	8273002	and as much as I would love to ride the train, I don't have that kind of time.
8273142	8283510	I even paid an extra $35 so that I could get the shortest flight possible because the flights it wanted to give me at the lowest price possible were something like 10 hours, including two layovers.
8283570	8288014	And I was like, at the moment I see the Atlanta airport on there, I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
8288074	8291036	Atlanta airport is like the bane of my existence.
8291056	8291196	Right.
8292117	8295881	Don't tell me this because I have to fly to Atlanta for DragonCon.
8295921	8296341	No, Rob.
8297142	8302626	Just one awesome thing, though, is the never-ending escalator that just goes up.
8303347	8305489	You cannot see the end of it for like an hour.
8305929	8308872	I refuse to believe anything is worse than the Philadelphia airport.
8309232	8310974	Thankfully, I've not done the Philadelphia airport.
8311034	8311634	It's pretty bad.
8312015	8315878	But I still think to this day my favorite airport for layout would have to be Burbank.
8316553	8317233	Oh, I love Burbank.
8317254	8318054	Burbank's so easy.
8318094	8318714	Burbank, yeah.
8318935	8321396	That's what I always call it.
8321556	8325399	Believe it or not, Dallas-Fort Worth is actually a really well laid out airport.
8325959	8327841	And you can get rides on the little golf carts.
8329328	8330669	Let's talk about airports.
8331809	8333530	Okay, and then my last one.
8333970	8336011	Now, I use this with a disclaimer.
8336171	8337091	I love my kitten.
8337752	8339392	My baby is so sweet.
8339872	8343994	But she had claws on her and clawed the crap out of my leg.
8344334	8345855	She was pouncing my feet.
8345915	8346915	I'd walk by, pounce.
8347576	8351557	And then she decided that she was going to claw up my calf, so finally we sat her down.
8351957	8358540	And then Dan's holding her, and I'm trying to clip her little claws, and she's wiggling and moving her paws out of the way.
8359060	8361322	and making the most god-awful noise.
8361582	8362003	It was like this.
8364985	8365486	Oh, lordy.
8365826	8366707	Yeah, that noise.
8367347	8368808	And I'm like, Mimi.
8369149	8369929	And then she runs off.
8369949	8371711	And the first thing, you know what she does once I'm done with her?
8371731	8375574	The first thing she does is goes into her room, looks at her bowl and says, you're giving me a treat, woman.
8377367	8377868	So I did.
8378508	8378829	All right.
8379850	8380170	Loki.
8381572	8386557	I guess FU to McDonald's for not getting orders correct.
8387258	8387658	Fair enough.
8387678	8388519	Is that it?
8389540	8389680	Yeah.
8389741	8389981	All right.
8390001	8393485	My FU of the week goes to The Scale for telling me the truth.
8395206	8397989	Next time, lie to me and make me feel better about myself, asshole.
8399867	8403408	Alright, let's get to a couple more news stories, and then we're going to open up the sky blind.
8403548	8404408	But first, Loki.
8404929	8414632	So, he has gotten some more funding, not necessarily from Kickstarter, but from some outside investors, including NVIDIA, actually.
8414992	8424314	NVIDIA is investing money in Luya, as well as the Mayfield Fund, Shasta Ventures, and the OCAM Partners, who I have no fucking clue who they are, but...
8426295	8430196	Yeah, so they've got another $15 million, which will help them launch retail.
8430596	8446981	Speaking of which, their retail launch, as I expected, was delayed to June 25th, as opposed to June 4th, because there's no fucking way they would ever hit that target with how fast they're shipping the Kickstarter backers, and then on top of that, the people that pre-ordered on OUYA.TV.
8448741	8456908	And they say they have 12,000 developers who have registered to make an Ouya game.
8457148	8463394	So that's not necessarily 12,000 games that are out there, but 12,000 people that are possibly going to make a game.
8464995	8465756	So, I don't know.
8468151	8471473	They claim they're ahead of schedule, but I don't buy it.
8472434	8473895	How much did you play your Ouya this week?
8474835	8475296	For a little bit.
8475356	8479358	I don't remember how long it was, though, but I checked out... What did I check out this week?
8479399	8481760	I downloaded this frog game that's supposed to be pretty fun.
8483241	8491407	I played more of the Pingu Puzzle Poker, which I may be writing a review on that at some point.
8491487	8494389	I don't want to yet because it's still beta.
8494889	8498091	It's not the finished game, so you don't want to do that.
8501336	8508888	I know I played some I just downloaded some more stuff I don't really remember playing any other games there's a few I tried that were kind of lame but I don't remember exactly what they were
8510717	8511817	Still haven't played Final Fantasy 3.
8512678	8513178	That's all right.
8513778	8514018	All right.
8514778	8517279	Anyhow, moving on to one more story tonight.
8517519	8522341	And this is about a comment from Bobby Kotick, who is the CEO of Activision.
8523061	8530383	And saying in an earnings call this week where they were talking about the loss of WoW subscribers and so forth.
8530723	8532944	But this isn't about PC stuff or WoW.
8532964	8533904	This is about console.
8534584	8539746	This is about the new consoles, Xbox, Lube, Infinity, 720, whatever you want to call it.
8540026	8542168	Loobfinity, and the PlayStation 4.
8543489	8560284	Quote, there are still many unknown factors such as pricing, launch dates, and quantities, the level of first-party support, and importantly, consumer purchase intent in a world where consoles are no longer just competing with each other, but also with new platforms such as smartphones and tablets.
8560785	8565789	He also went on to say that Wii U had a, quote, very slow start and uncertainties
8566750	8574394	So far, no Call of Duty ghosts on Wii U either.
8574895	8576596	Well, yeah.
8578457	8580258	I think, yeah, it's a very big possibility.
8580358	8588182	I think, though, it's less going to be, oh, I have a smartphone and tablet, I can play these games on here, which no one's actually thinking that.
8589143	8609897	but I think it's more of why do I need to buy an next-gen console because Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out right then or hey I want to play Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty Ghosts hey guess what those are both on current gen consoles or Assassin's Creed you know Black Flag oh current gen consoles you know or Watch Dogs current gen as well so it's like why do I need to buy a new console for these
8609997	8639658	and they're going to have to figure out this whole what am I going to do with another console you know when I want to play all the old games and they're not backwards compatible they showed footage of Black Flag on the Playstation 4 you can't tell the difference you can't tell the difference between the Playstation 3 and Playstation 4 version of that game I'm sure it's other like simulation like physics stuff in there but I don't know I can't really tell much of a difference um
8642805	8643694	I lost my train of thought.
8647321	8648381	Maybe first party games?
8648541	8648941	I don't know.
8649982	8650782	You know, that might help.
8651302	8653663	Because, I mean, they're going to have some exclusive first party stuff.
8653683	8657024	But that's, once again, it kind of sells systems.
8657484	8658544	I remembered what I was going to say.
8658604	8664026	There's rumors about this new Xbox, whatever it's called, that there's an HDMI pass-through port on it.
8664086	8664766	Have you heard about this?
8664846	8669587	Where, you know, you'll be able to save an HDMI thing because you can use the pass-through port.
8670087	8672028	Wouldn't it be funny if that only worked with a 360?
8673388	8673648	Outro Music
8695836	8703678	Of course, they wouldn't necessarily openly say that, but... Nah, I don't think they could even do... They don't do that.
8703939	8706659	In fact, actually, they don't really have an encrypted HDMI.
8706779	8708720	It's PlayStation 3 that does.
8708880	8714302	In fact, if you try to do video capture through HDMI, you can't do that on the PlayStation 3.
8714802	8716102	You can only do that on the 360.
8716242	8724545	I think you might be able to do it on the PlayStation 3 up to a certain... Maybe not 1080p, but I know you can't do 1080p through HDMI on the PS3.
8725625	8727485	I don't see them doing that.
8727565	8733246	It's still going to be very awkward with another console sitting next to your console to do back to compatibility.
8733527	8734987	Just don't worry about it and just say, you know what?
8735687	8736547	We're going to drop the price of the 360.
8737087	8737627	You have a 360.
8738427	8739428	You don't need to sell it.
8739508	8743768	You can just hold on to it and play your games on that.
8743848	8744469	I don't really know.
8745129	8747109	I'm sure they'll have a solution for it at some point.
8747209	8750530	I don't see it as that big a deal because I'm not really going to get rid of my 360.
8752537	8754719	MM2K in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
8771836	8772457	It might be.
8773117	8779322	We may have a Wii U situation where it's just, hey, there's the launch titles and not a whole ton.
8779522	8792051	I still think we're going to see more third-party games, but I think it's going to be a lot of this, it's on PS4 and it's on PS3 because they're worried that, oh, well, we may not make up the sales on just a PlayStation 4 exclusive game.
8792632	8796614	I think that's going to be a real big issue is you're going to say, well...
8797595	8821643	especially if like if the Assassin's Creed thing I mean I'm sure it looks similar to the PC version probably exactly like the PC version but I haven't seen the PS3 version running next to the PS4 version so I can't say that it's like night and day but it doesn't look from what they showed it doesn't look night and day based off the trailers it looks exactly the same but I mean I think the trailers are captured off of the PC so you know that's not a surprise there
8822202	8822482	All right.
8822983	8824865	Well, let's open up the Skype line, guys.
8825045	8825706	Call us.
8826007	8828630	That's the last we have on our list for the show tonight.
8829291	8830672	But what do you guys want to talk about?
8830692	8835638	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8836079	8841205	I just got an email on my little emails from Joe from earlier in the show thanking us for having him on.
8841727	8843389	So that was a fun interview.
8844510	8852957	If you missed the interview earlier, be sure to download it on the podcast feed or check it out on a streaming solution like Stitcher or TuneIn, one of your favorite apps there.
8853838	8861705	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call and say hello and talk about whatever's going on in your mind this week.
8864121	8865002	All right, let's go to the phones.
8865062	8866323	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8866363	8866783	Who's this?
8867424	8868325	Hi, it's Zaku here.
8868345	8869385	Hey, Zaku.
8869566	8870306	We see you.
8870326	8870987	How's everyone?
8871187	8872548	How's everything going?
8872728	8873749	Good, good.
8874450	8875731	Now we see you in studio.
8875811	8876471	It's like you're here.
8876571	8876912	What's up?
8878413	8884558	Nothing much, just catching up on some post-Mother's Day gaming.
8885439	8890003	Dug up my old PS2 to play some San Andreas after like a three-year hiatus.
8890737	8891538	Some classics.
8891598	8893880	You know my Grand Theft Auto 4 is still in the shrink wrap.
8893900	8895882	I can't believe you just called that a classic, Rob.
8896703	8897444	It is, isn't it?
8897644	8899306	It's almost 10 years old.
8899486	8902790	I mean, you're talking about a game that's almost a decade old.
8902850	8903951	That's kind of classic.
8904151	8904832	Wait, what?
8905032	8908716	Even 3 and Vice City are pretty much classic at this point.
8909195	8911637	Dude, you haven't played Grand Theft Auto 4.
8911957	8914338	Go play Grand Theft Auto 4.
8914619	8916160	Wait, I think I did a little bit.
8917020	8917661	I don't remember.
8917881	8920522	If I did, it was a long time ago when it first came out.
8921383	8930369	Well, he's... At the very least, if you're going to participate in the VOG gaming night this week, you do need to play past the first few missions, I think, in order to get the multiplayer options.
8930469	8935772	I got really far in GTA 4, and then I lost my 360 copy, so now I have to start again for my PC.
8936673	8938714	and the one that I have on Steam.
8938854	8941855	Wouldn't it be funny though, Loki, if I started playing and I got totally addicted to it?
8942155	8942736	It's awesome.
8942776	8943736	It seriously is.
8944316	8945197	I do like hoes.
8946397	8947938	I hear there's lots of hoes in Grand Theft Auto 4.
8947978	8949299	No, no, no, Rob, you like ho-hoes.
8949959	8950519	It's different.
8950579	8952100	Hey, you're calling me fat.
8954401	8955181	Sorry, Zaku.
8955281	8956862	So you're playing San Andreas.
8958342	8963650	Yeah, just catching up on that and basically trying to juggle my queue.
8963850	8965452	But I digress.
8965973	8972582	I guess part of what I wanted to bring up was the fact that the whole next-gen...
8975199	8992428	The whole next-gen issues with some of the folks who are part of it, like Nintendo basically bet the whole barn on the Wii U, and so far it's like EA's pushing back, Activision may, as you've already stated, may be on its way out.
8992468	9004634	So it pretty much goes to the point where did Nintendo intend for this to be a Hail Mary because they were getting outgunned by the fact that the Wii was so far behind this current gen?
9006576	9010379	Yes, but there's a part of me that wonders if it's not a bridge console.
9010740	9018687	And I threw that idea out because they invested so much in this gamepad and it wasn't just the same type of stuff you saw on the Wii.
9018787	9027254	I think if we had just seen literally a quote-unquote super Wii, it would have been more of a bridge console, which is what I honestly thought we were going to get.
9027374	9029716	And then when we got the gamepad, I was like, oh, maybe not.
9029756	9030957	But now I'm starting to wonder again.
9031778	9032399	On the other hand...
9055221	9065749	The word on the street is that Microsoft actually at the last minute, it looks like they're going to ditch the whole always online requirement.
9067651	9068632	Funny how that happened.
9069893	9080761	It works in their favor in the sense that Sony basically was forced to, since the fact that they went early, it makes it easier for
9081880	9082622	Thank you for watching!
9094560	9109457	and then all of a sudden they could just go in at the very last minute and announce all the things, pretty much dispel every rumor that's been going on for almost the past year and they could pretty much be on par, if not slightly above, going into E3.
9109497	9112320	They could do that, but they probably won't.
9113482	9114743	On the other hand, think about it.
9114763	9119309	From what I'm hearing, it's pretty much the same console.
9119329	9121752	They're all going to be running Blu-rays.
9121772	9123154	They're all going to have 8 gigs of RAM.
9123835	9126598	Although one of them may require more things than others.
9127319	9127499	But...
9129980	9154045	If the rumors end up becoming true where they ditch online, then that might just bring around some of the folks who are on the fence who pretty much didn't abandon Sony, but at the same time they pretty much had the thoughts that if they had to go on and defend this lipstick on a pig by making sure, by defending always online, then yeah, it would have been sweet to Sony, but...
9156435	9165538	If by E3 Microsoft basically pulls what they have to, they could pretty much be neck and neck.
9165578	9172321	It's almost like an election where you try to blackball the other guy, you try to throw mud, and then all of a sudden...
9174717	9181240	You do an event where you're pretty much even in the polls.
9181680	9182740	That's how I think of it.
9186721	9190423	You think Nintendo or Sony started that rumor about Microsoft always being online?
9191263	9193264	I'm thinking it's Microsoft themselves.
9193344	9197085	I mean, this is coming from their developers who not only...
9198306	9202893	from third-party devs that managed to get their hands on the early dev kits.
9202953	9205356	And especially that guy, that product manager that opened his mouth
9210140	9211701	On Twitter, that didn't help.
9212261	9215602	Zaku, here's the thing about Nintendo, Zaku.
9215702	9222464	I am not willing to write them off yet until... Because if they price drop at E3, the game is afoot again.
9222524	9225105	It's a whole new game, level 2.
9225925	9230046	It's 3DS all over again if they price drop at E3, which is highly likely, I think.
9230746	9235528	But at the same time, it's starting to shape up like a two-horse race at this point.
9236431	9240032	2 Horse Race in the sense of the next generation
9259964	9261265	That's all it is.
9261525	9261965	You're right.
9262025	9266326	There is an argument to be made to keep what you currently have in this generation.
9266366	9273947	Hell, I'm not even almost half a year into my PS3 right there that my girl got me this past Christmas.
9274748	9282769	It's still fresh to me knowing the fact that I had my other platforms to juggle before the PS3.
9283610	9284610	I'm still chewing on that.
9285464	9289748	So may I get, you know, will I be getting one of those new, you know, new consoles?
9289928	9290549	Not likely.
9290749	9291150	Not yet.
9292191	9293452	Usually I just wait a while.
9294551	9297593	I will, most likely, because I'm a consumer whore.
9297794	9300376	Going into this next gen, it might be a two horse race.
9301937	9302617	We will see.
9302857	9305319	Let's have this conversation again after E3 and see what happens.
9305399	9306500	Speculation right now.
9306580	9308602	Alright, Zaku, I'm going to let you go to get more calls.
9308842	9309302	Take care, buddy.
9310043	9312845	Bye.
9313285	9313566	He's right.
9313606	9314947	It's all speculation right now.
9314967	9315907	At least that part he's right.
9316208	9317468	It's all speculation right now.
9317488	9318789	It's way too early to say.
9319550	9319570	I...
9321263	9322104	Rob, it's a trumpet!
9350925	9354929	Oh my god, Bobby's on webcam and he's actually got his cartridge.
9354989	9355750	That's awesome.
9356110	9357091	It's a trumpet, Rob.
9359293	9361315	Happy Mother's Day to you too, Mom.
9361355	9362376	Happy Mother's Day.
9364538	9365839	What's on your mind, Bobby?
9366159	9367381	I just wanted to tell you it was a trumpet.
9369202	9370784	I thought it was a drumstick with you.
9372247	9372888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9394161	9395463	I wish you a happy anniversary of your hatching
9411906	9414088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9428004	9433046	I was too hypnotized by the music of Professor Shy Guy who was fun on your show.
9433206	9435046	It's been Kickstarter night on VOG tonight.
9435126	9436047	Yes.
9436427	9440428	So yeah, everybody check that out because he's a great guy.
9440468	9445890	I've actually seen him perform before and he was the person playing when GLaDOS made me get on a dance floor.
9447033	9448594	Oh, okay, I remember that story.
9448734	9455116	Oh, now that all ties together, because I know he was talking about Elle McClain, who is a confirmed guest of GamerX.
9455516	9459558	So maybe I will finally get to meet her in August at that whole thing.
9459578	9460818	I'm excited about that.
9460898	9463759	And then you can name drop me, and she'll be like, oh yeah, I remember him.
9463880	9465320	I will absolutely name drop you.
9465340	9466761	I'll be like, yeah, we're on the same network.
9466781	9467601	Yeah, good times.
9468841	9471122	And then we may get Professor Shy Guy at DragonCon.
9471662	9471943	Awesome.
9472263	9472783	For our thing.
9473283	9476205	I know, I know, we got a lot of conventions coming up.
9476305	9478606	Are you getting excited about E3 only a few weeks away?
9479206	9479586	Not yet.
9479846	9480167	Not yet?
9480647	9480947	Not yet.
9480967	9481667	It takes a while.
9482348	9490772	Like, it's like right before, because right now it's like I'm getting all the invites to things, so it's like now I'm trying to figure out what I want to schedule and what I don't want to schedule.
9491852	9493693	And so, yeah, I'm playing all that game right now.
9493933	9497695	I'm still waiting to hear back from the E3 Pope, but that's my own fault for waiting so long to do it.
9497775	9499716	But, you know, it is what it is.
9499736	9500817	But at least we're going to Disneyland.
9501357	9504641	Yes, yes, I've already got my plane tickets and we'll be going.
9505001	9506283	Anybody else going to join us on that?
9506623	9507765	It might just be me.
9507805	9508125	I don't know.
9508165	9510768	I would love to drag DarkSakura, but I don't know if she's going to be game.
9510948	9511289	We'll see.
9512070	9515393	I will always go to Disneyland when I can, but I am the unemployed.
9515534	9516274	Here's the thing.
9516335	9520119	It also depends on if I get blessed by the E3 Pope or not.
9520299	9523081	If I do, then it will definitely only be you and me.
9523481	9529164	But if I don't, then that opens up the opportunity that I can be like, hey, you don't have to sit around while I'm at a convention center all day.
9529244	9531805	Let's go to Disneyland for a day or two.
9533466	9534867	We'll find out that answer this week.
9535107	9535947	It better be this week.
9536488	9536848	So we'll see.
9538204	9565749	so I just wanted to tell you that it was a trumpet I plug Professor Shy Guy's Kickstarter as well as the Zelda movie Kickstarter because I actually the thing about with Joe and I'm not going to give details or anything I actually do know what he's going to be doing with the movie I know the narrative and what the movie and it's really an interesting take on documentaries is what he's doing he told me that and then he later specifically said don't tell people that yet
9566462	9567383	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9586243	9587484	Yeah, and I think he is coming.
9587524	9589505	Like, he said Sacramento is one of the places.
9590125	9590485	Wow.
9590646	9591906	That you may be traveling to.
9592186	9594048	I will have to go check it out.
9594228	9595228	What the hell goes on here?
9595268	9597229	Maybe SacAnime is getting huge out here.
9597329	9603233	Actually, SacAnime has been growing, and there's another convention that started up, fuck, I want to say in Rockland.
9603504	9604724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9626269	9632151	He actually was here to talk to three different Zelda fan groups that were all based in Atlanta.
9632631	9642513	And he's coming back because the Symphony of the Goddesses is performing in Atlanta and he's going to do some follow-up stuff with them and do some more follow-up stuff with some of the other Atlanta people as well.
9642593	9647534	So he's kind of more meeting the people rather than really going to conventions.
9647554	9651495	He's just now starting to go to conventions, but he also might be at DragonCon as well.
9651636	9651856	Sure.
9652116	9652536	Makes sense.
9652716	9653116	Makes sense.
9653683	9657544	Alright, well, Bobby, anything else you want to plug or talk about while you're here?
9659124	9662845	No, you guys may want to tune in June 2nd during our shows.
9664605	9665505	For a little something something.
9665725	9666525	Dot, dot, dot.
9666546	9667286	Dot, dot, dot.
9667466	9667786	Exactly.
9667826	9668546	To be continued.
9668886	9669526	To be continued.
9669546	9672407	Alright, what would June 2nd mark the one year anniversary of?
9672467	9673147	I'm trying to think.
9673167	9673847	I don't know.
9673927	9674507	I don't know.
9674587	9676988	Alright, Bobby, always a pleasure to talk to you.
9677008	9677168	June 2nd, 2012?
9679668	9680188	Yeah.
9680209	9681990	It'll be the one-year anniversary of that.
9682010	9684491	That day is... Oh, shut up, Loki.
9684531	9684831	All right.
9685292	9686212	I'm gonna let you go, Bobby.
9686232	9686533	Take care.
9686553	9686933	All right.
9687233	9687693	Bye.
9688434	9690075	Always a pleasure to talk to Bobby Blackwolf.
9690115	9694498	He's always good enough to have us on his show every week, so it's always nice when we can return the favor.
9694518	9699261	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
9699301	9700642	I want to do Twitter topics, too.
9700982	9702043	I'm like, where's my iPad?
9702083	9702763	Where's my iPad?
9702843	9706265	Oh, it's in the iCade, so let me just get that out of there.
9707586	9708066	You know what?
9708467	9709988	You don't even have to lift that thing to get it out.
9710568	9711169	Oh, I always do.
9711749	9713891	Yeah, I've... Fingers.
9714991	9716512	You saying I should just finger it a little bit?
9716833	9717773	Yeah, you need to finger it, Rob.
9719415	9720095	Alright, I will.
9720555	9721376	I'll finger it next time.
9721756	9725639	Alright, before we get to last minute stories with Loki, let's try to take at least one more call here tonight.
9725679	9726600	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
9726620	9726960	Who's this?
9728141	9729101	Hey, this is Actdeft.
9729702	9730262	Hi, Actdeft.
9730282	9730683	How you doing?
9732044	9732584	Really fine.
9732944	9733284	And you?
9734125	9734445	Good.
9734485	9735306	What's on your mind tonight?
9736530	9740991	Well, I wanted to just say that I backed up the Zelda Kickstarter.
9741692	9742192	Oh, hey!
9742532	9747053	Hey, I'm glad to hear our show is helping and that it actually does help spread the word.
9747373	9748774	What made you decide to pitch in and help?
9749654	9758176	Well, I already had read Bobby's article on VOG, so I pretty much had the intention of doing so.
9758456	9758696	Mm-hmm.
9759037	9763578	But, well, interviewing the guy, John, I think.
9763818	9763978	Mm-hmm.
9765638	9768840	He pretty much has a great idea here.
9769501	9775626	His project seems like a really, really interesting thing to do.
9776167	9779670	Especially for something that many people like, like Selva.
9782272	9793183	And something that he probably mentioned that really strikes me really good is that, for example, you're here because of video games.
9793964	9795145	And one of them was Zelda.
9795605	9799930	And you were inspired by video games to do your show.
9800630	9805235	Not to mention Bobby and many other shows on VOG and other podcasts out there.
9805895	9810396	Not to mention me that I do the I Love That Song articles on VOG.
9811856	9814617	Video games and video game music inspire me to do that.
9814677	9819217	So yeah, I do have Zelda in part to think of that.
9819277	9827919	So I really want to see more of the fans rather than just the history of Zelda and its creation.
9828319	9833100	I want to see how people were affected by this game.
9834122	9840485	Now, of course, in some ways, I think this particular show, you would have to credit Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania a little more so.
9840585	9848910	But, I mean, the honest reality is, would I have ever played those games or been into gaming in the first place if it wasn't for the great classic 8-bit games that kind of paved the way?
9849330	9849670	I don't know.
9849710	9851551	And certainly Zelda played an influence in that.
9852731	9857634	So it's, you know, it's... I liked his answer to that question a lot, too.
9857654	9859055	It kind of made me go, oh, yeah, that's true.
9859115	9863497	You know, there is a lot of inspiration for what I'm doing every Sunday night that comes from games like Zelda.
9863977	9864498	and so forth.
9865959	9871043	Yeah, and I really want to see this project finished or at least backed up.
9872504	9886876	Though it has a long way to go, but I think that if people understand what the meaning of this project is and not necessarily think, oh, it's gonna be about Zelda and
9887837	9889698	Oh my god, they're going to prop it up.
9889798	9891159	Nintendo.
9891379	9893620	And do something wrong with it.
9893680	9894821	I don't think that's the matter.
9895041	9899564	Maybe the instant assumption that it's going to get shut down is a little bit silly, too.
9899744	9903626	I mean, if it was going to get instantly shut down, I think it would have been already.
9903746	9906147	And I think, again, you look at something like King of Kong.
9906467	9908048	Donkey Kong was a Nintendo game, too.
9908469	9909229	And it happened.
9909449	9911350	So there's ways he can do it.
9911550	9913972	And he sounds like he's got his... What did he say?
9914032	9916253	He's dotting his lowercase j's or whatever he said?
9916273	9916393	Yeah.
9916673	9920844	that he's got it explored with the legal team and so forth.
9921065	9924374	He's ready to fight for his movie if he has to a little bit.
9925239	9930821	Yeah, I don't think he has any legal problems, at least because of the material.
9931421	9942824	So it isn't like he's taking explicit, sorry, Nintendo property for profit or something like that.
9942864	9947145	So I think he's going to be fine in that sense.
9948026	9951567	The fans, that's what I'm worried about, but...
9952643	9962428	Like I said, if they understand the meaning behind this project and understand what it is exactly, I think that it will get a higher response.
9963389	9980038	Well, you know, that's part of the reason why we had him on the show tonight to kind of get people talking and more people looking and, you know, maybe some, even if just a couple folks friend the thing on Facebook and then share it with their friends, that's going to be exposure to possibly, you know, thousands more people that didn't see it before, possibly, so...
9981119	9999672	a lot of it is about getting the word out so we'll see what happens but I do plan on backing it myself that and the Professor Shy Guy one I'll give him some money too I think that was pretty cool so alright yeah that project too seems pretty good to back up too alright well Actdeft any other quick thoughts before I let you go
10001194	10002115	Nothing more.
10002755	10004056	I sent you a Twitter topic.
10004316	10006198	I don't know if you read it already.
10006318	10010320	I am looking at it right now, but since you brought it up, I'll go ahead and talk about it with you here.
10010380	10010621	Let's see.
10010641	10013803	You tweeted us and it says, Skullgirls items for Team Fortress 2.
10014043	10019166	They are up on the Steam Workshop for fans to vote and approve so they can be pre-order items.
10019366	10020987	So what sort of items do we have to look forward to?
10022408	10025889	They're basically hats and you know what for TF2.
10026169	10026469	Of course.
10026489	10027349	They look pretty cool.
10028329	10029350	They're pretty well designed.
10030030	10031570	It wouldn't be too gorgeous if there weren't hats.
10033831	10043513	These items actually were rewards for the Indiegogo they had for the DLC characters and the PC version.
10044513	10053919	But Valve said to tell to them that they had to approve first of the items and then see if they can release them as pre-order incentives.
10054639	10067907	Though now they have like the, not a green light, but basically that fans have to approve of the items so they can be put as incentives of pre-orders.
10068667	10072369	And also the backers of the project of them.
10074597	10074917	All right.
10074998	10079743	Well, check that out on the Steam store in the community section.
10080163	10082566	And lots of cool add-ons for games out there.
10082826	10084568	I really love how Steam's been expanding that.
10084708	10087612	You know I love me some Mass Effect Civs in Civ 5.
10088733	10088993	All right.
10089274	10092457	Well, Actdeft, I'm going to let you go so I can get these other Twitter topics and wrap up the show.
10092497	10093418	But have a good one, buddy, okay?
10093959	10094279	You too.
10094299	10094880	Thanks.
10095080	10095340	Bye.
10096001	10097983	SSJ100 Matt tweeted us about ESPN ranked the best sports video games of all time.
10116917	10118017	Here are the top five.
10119698	10121319	WWF No Mercy, number five.
10122159	10124620	MVP Baseball 2005, number four.
10125320	10127721	Mike Tyson's Punch Out, number three.
10128281	10130181	NHL 94, number two.
10130542	10131782	Yeah, that's a pretty good one.
10132162	10134003	Tecmo Super Bowl, number one.
10134823	10138244	Clearly, clearly, I mean, you can't argue with that.
10138264	10140505	You know what, I still like Super High Impact.
10141885	10146247	Also, this list is badly needing... I don't see if there was maybe a 6 through 10.
10146287	10147268	There are no Blades of Steel.
10147948	10149409	Blades of Steel is not here.
10149969	10153391	And NBA Jam, which I think would have been a worthy addition, is not here.
10153431	10155232	Depending on the version of NBA Jam.
10155332	10156953	Because there are some shitty versions.
10156973	10157753	Yeah, not the new one.
10158113	10162896	Well, if you want the hardest home version ever, you want to look for the PlayStation Tournament Edition.
10162936	10164397	How much is the original arcade version?
10164437	10165497	That's the one I would do.
10167558	10194953	so okay very interesting but I'm okay with Tecmo Super Bowl being number one and you know even though I don't play a lot of sports video games I think it says a lot that I think I have played at least three if not four of the games on that list so I think that says a lot as to why they are the top five some other tweets here from Tigerclaw Defiance the TV show Tigerclaw tweets us saying Defiance was renewed for a second season that shocked the hell out of me because this is a sci-fi show isn't it yeah
10195473	10208915	I actually downloaded the first four episodes to watch I haven't watched them yet because shit's been happening I think quite a few people have been watching it I hear a lot of people talking about it I did read over the Wikipedia article on it and it actually seemed really interesting
10210354	10221540	I watched on Netflix three episodes of Scandal last night, which has nothing to do with sci-fi, but I bet Nellie would watch Scandal because it's by the chick who does Grey's Anatomy, which I'm almost embarrassed to say I watched it, but it's pretty good.
10221560	10224001	It's pretty good.
10224021	10224801	It's pretty good, Loki.
10224821	10225281	Scandal's pretty good.
10225301	10228403	I still want to know what the thing is with Nellie and her Tyra Banks obsession.
10229778	10230399	Thanks for watching!
10245675	10259855	one more tweet from TigerClaw and this is about a Capcom promotion for Resident Evil filling a pool with blood and gore well you know this came from the UK marketing department it was the first blood filled swimming pool
10261036	10261616	Good lord.
10261796	10269058	It's going to have 55,000 gallons of water, and I'm using the little quotey fingers, featuring... With corn syrup and red food coloring.
10269118	10269518	I'm sure.
10269638	10277521	Fake human torsos as flotation devices, intestines as lane markers, and all kinds of gruesome objects floating in the water.
10278421	10281922	The event is near London's Olympic Stadium, but not actually there.
10281962	10282442	That would be weird.
10283563	10296894	It will be that you can get the tickets for free on Monday, May 20th, but only 200 are given out each day leading up to the pools opening on May 25th and 26th weekend, Memorial Day weekend, although I guess maybe that's not a thing in the UK.
10297795	10300117	If you're under 18, you need to have a parent.
10301378	10303140	Whatever, that sounds whack.
10303160	10303620	You know what?
10305201	10308164	Really, there's nothing quite like bathing in the blood of fresh virgins.
10309185	10310045	Well, now you can.
10311246	10312628	But only if it's real blood.
10313729	10318092	And it actually is really, really good softener for your skin.
10318312	10320254	Just saying, a facial made out of the blood of your eyes.
10320274	10322516	That would be concerning if it was real blood.
10322596	10324217	This is just stupid.
10324517	10326039	Well, the meat market thing was stupid, too.
10326699	10327039	Yeah.
10327279	10328240	It's just like, really?
10328360	10329941	Why is it always UK stuff?
10330381	10330681	Really?
10330701	10331122	Sorry.
10331422	10332882	Because if they did it over here.
10333123	10333723	I mean, then again.
10333743	10337365	I mean, no disrespect to our overseas friends, but y'all are crazy.
10337385	10341327	But then again, did you know that the Scottish diet was built on a dare, right?
10342688	10344329	I bet it was Dutch influence.
10344509	10346390	I bet still had something to do with this.
10346450	10347410	I'm blaming the Dutch.
10348131	10349251	I don't blame the Dutch.
10349972	10352413	Just, I don't know, any place where, you know, blood pudding.
10352433	10353273	And I'm half Dutch.
10353554	10355595	Where black pudding is served regularly.
10355635	10355975	I don't know.
10356604	10358485	All right, Loki, any last-minute stories?
10358925	10366269	No, unfortunately, I don't have any last-minute stories because I'm busy cramming to write an article that will be on the website tomorrow.
10366529	10368110	And I just realized, hey, you know what?
10368290	10369350	I'm not a very good writer.
10370691	10371932	It's challenging.
10372132	10373132	It is very challenging.
10373192	10373993	I could be your editor.
10374633	10375754	No, that's all right.
10375774	10377274	We don't have time for multiple editors.
10377935	10380296	It's write and send to somebody.
10380356	10381516	I'll talk to you off-air.
10381717	10382397	There's always plans.
10382757	10383017	All right.
10383718	10390083	Anyhow, so if there's no last minute stories, then I guess it is time to wrap up the show, which is fine because it's about nine o'clock anyway.
10390924	10392405	Let's go around and wrap up.
10394046	10396188	Thank you guys all for listening and tuning in tonight.
10396368	10398910	Remember, if you like the show, please help spread the word about the show.
10399891	10404494	Give us a nice five star review on iTunes or a thumbs up and support independent podcasting.
10404795	10409599	You know, there's a lot of indie broadcasters out there that work very hard at what they do, and we really need your support.
10409659	10409919	You know,
10410439	10416842	Not all of us can just snap our fingers and have people pouring money onto us.
10417022	10418003	And I'm not asking for your money.
10418323	10425227	But we don't have that luxury where we can do that and just have money poured onto us to buy promotion and other things for our show.
10425747	10427928	We're not afforded that luxury in the independent community.
10427988	10429669	So word of mouth is so important.
10429709	10433171	So all we ask, we're not asking for your money, we're just asking for your word of mouth.
10433831	10434671	Tell a friend about the show.
10434751	10437733	Help grow our community because community is our motivator.
10438093	10439454	And the more motivation we have...
10440074	10440514	The Better.
10442555	10444956	Meanwhile, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.
10445256	10446957	Why don't I start with you, Loki?
10446977	10447837	What's your final thought tonight?
10448957	10458121	My final thought is be sure to check out our VOG Gaming Night Thursdays, 8pm Pacific Standard Time.
10459982	10461883	I don't know if it's going to stay on that day, but maybe.
10462123	10463303	I think that's the most convenient day.
10463323	10464504	It doesn't conflict with anybody else.
10464884	10468145	I know it's a little bit late on the East Coast and beyond, but
10468505	10490264	but uh this week Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360 if you don't want to play that game on 360 be sure to go to our forums and let me know what game you do want to play and we can try to work that in because I've been asking and no one's been saying anything except for Bobby and which it's kind of shocking to see Bobby recommend Grand Theft Auto but it's going to be a lot of fun
10490623	10492504	because he wants you to show off your elite skills.
10492724	10493784	He's hoping to learn a thing or two.
10493804	10495305	Oh, I'll climb some skyscrapers.
10496365	10496965	I bet you will.
10498025	10501006	My final thought is I would like to play Where the Fuck is Jamie Now?
10501427	10502827	Oh, but she's right here at my table.
10503307	10503747	You win!
10504287	10504668	Yay!
10504768	10505788	Here, have some trail mix.
10506588	10507609	That stuff is addicting.
10507989	10509129	I just threw it together.
10509209	10510269	Damn you, coconut.
10510369	10511910	I'm trying to lose weight, not gain it.
10512450	10512970	You know what?
10513230	10514931	The coconut is actually not very sweet.
10515350	10516130	and SuperFatty.
10516190	10516451	Alright.
10516551	10517311	It's good for you.
10517451	10519292	Eat it.
10519452	10520513	It's a trumpet, Jamie.
10520573	10521233	It's a trumpet.
10521773	10522214	No, it's not.
10522254	10523294	It's actually Reese's Pieces.
10523935	10525775	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
10526796	10529517	My cat is insane and she doesn't know what is right.
10530738	10531699	No, seriously.
10533099	10536101	I think that... Is it a full moon or something?
10536121	10538242	Because Midna has been completely apeshit.
10539767	10544771	I have no idea, but I'm probably going to go home and get pounced again, so who knows what's going to happen.
10546092	10559342	Also, I am doing a live streaming Mass Effect 3 with my really shitty but sometimes funny commentary from 5 to 8 Pacific Time on my Twitch TV channel.
10559562	10560783	I need to do some streaming.
10560823	10561744	I feel left out.
10561984	10562965	Maybe I'll stream tonight.
10563305	10563826	You know what?
10564326	10566808	We should do a post-Horde House multiplayer.
10568042	10590563	I will drink that is probably a possibility we should make Shane drink and I'll drink and we'll both be dunk I don't think Shane's gonna drink for like another five years after what happened the other night which I think sadly I think the archive video's probably already gone off Twitch TV and we didn't export any of it but it was good times so alright that's it guys we're gonna close up shop and get out of here tonight
10590843	10592724	Thanks again for tuning in and supporting us.
10592864	10594765	We will be back next week.
