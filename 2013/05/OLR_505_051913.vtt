Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, May 19th, 2013, Nintendo makes a controversial move against Let's Play videos.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Virtual trading cards come to Steam, and a new Gran Turismo game is announced for the PlayStation 3.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May 19th, 2013, episode number 505 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about games and gaming news with all you in our chat and listening on our podcast feed.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
And my co-hosts. Joining us remotely tonight, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Hi.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi, how are you doing?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I has a cold.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm sorry to hear it. How'd you get that?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Dan.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Aw.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
He's like, I just have allergies, let's share a soda. Oops, sorry, it was cold.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
I thought maybe he might have got something at that whole PinnaGogo thing. Did you go to that, which was this weekend?

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
He was, I think, already sick before that.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Don't.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
So, but he only got to do one day at PinnaGogo and missed like their annual pinball group barbecue.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
Now for those who don't know what PinnaGogo is, it's this big pinball exposition thing they do in NorCal.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Dixon.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Dixon. There ain't shit in Dixon either. It's a weird place for PinnaGogo.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
No, there's stuff in Dixon. There's pollen and a really good ice cream parlor.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
And they don't even have a 24 hour Starbucks anymore. Alright, anyway.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
But they do have a Mary's Pizza Shack.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, they do. And they do have PinnaGogo, which is pretty awesome.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
Apparently this year was supposed to be like totally bombed. They had every spot filled. They couldn't take any more people in because of power usage.

01:58.000 --> 02:09.000
And I really wanted to go because they had all kinds of prototype machines and they had the new X-Men table and like all kinds of stuff I really wanted to go.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
But Dan was sick and I wasn't going to go without him because I have no other reason to go to Dixon.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
And who can blame you? Alright, we'll also say hello to here in studio, Techmaster Loki.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Hi.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
How are you, Techmaster Loki?

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm fine. I'm organizing Steam games.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
Now, what was this you were trying to figure out? Maybe one of our listeners knows because we do have the live chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
When we are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
We do have the chatters joining us. Maybe one of them knows the answer to your question.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Well, I was just wondering if there is a way to... Oh, I guess there's different categories and stuff you could say.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Just seeing if there is a way to like, you know... Oh, okay. Here we go. Categories. You can add categories to the games.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
Basically the folder sort. Some of the games I have because I have now over 100 games. Thank you, Amazon.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Do they have a crazy sale recently or something?

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
They're still going until the end of the month. It's their like... I don't remember what they call it. Their mega sale or something.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
There's like a whole bunch of games and bundles and stuff. There's some really good Sonic bundles.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
If you like Sonic the Hedgehog, you can get almost all the games that they have on PC including the Genesis stuff for like 20 bucks.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
So it's like a Steam sale but it's on Amazon.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
Actually, that's the thing. I've been finding a lot of these sales on Steam games on other sites.

03:33.000 --> 03:42.000
Like Green Man Gaming or Amazon. Amazon for a lot of the stuff. Even Gamefly has stuff and it's all redeemable on Steam.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Or Origin. They actually have some games on Origin that I really wanted but I am not installing Origin.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I don't blame you, sir.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm passing on it. Battlefield 3 was $10. I really wanted Battlefield 3.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
I wanted to sell my soul to play Mass Effect 3 online on the PC.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
And I really wanted Command & Conquer. Thankfully, I wanted Red Alert 3 because I forgot all about it.

04:04.000 --> 04:14.000
And I went back and started playing some of the older games but I saw in the trailer for it that they have George the K is in it.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Wasn't Tim Curry in that one too?

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Tim Curry is in it. Yes, Tim Curry is in it. And they even have...

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Oh, who the hell is it? I can see her face and I can't think of her name.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Jenny McCarthy is in it. She plays Tanya.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Random.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, she plays the assassin chick.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
But yeah, it's so awesome.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
Because they went back in the second game. I don't know if they had the full motion video cutscenes.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
But they went back to the way that the first game was where they had full motion video cutscenes.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
It's just awesome. But it also has origin and I'm not doing that. So, I'm sorry.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
Going to the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, ActDeft says you can sort your games in your Steam library.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
So you can at least sort them differently. I don't know.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah, I'll just have to mess around with it.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
Alright. Well, we're going to get to how was your gaming week and the types of things you've been playing this week.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
But before we do, I wanted to do a quick kick-off topic.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Obviously, this week we have the big Xbox reveal is coming up on Tuesday.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
And we've had rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor this, rumor that.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Always online, always not. Xbox 720, Xbox Infinity.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Going to replace your cable system. Going to have Kinect built in.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
I thought now would be a good time to talk about what are your final predictions for what is going to happen on Tuesday.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
I don't know if we're going to actually have a show next week. Memorial Day weekend.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Because Dark Soccer is going to be out of town. We already knew that.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I may actually be out of town as well. So if there's two out of three of us are out of town.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
I'll just talk.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Loki will do the one man show. Didn't you do that one year?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I've done it a couple times.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Yeah, those shows are really interesting you guys.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
You can discuss pizza and bacon.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
I might. If I've got stuff to talk about it sounds so bad.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
But trying to stretch like, you know.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
It's more fun when it's live and we have the chatters for that kind of instant feedback too.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Even when we're wrong.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I can team up with Bobby I guess.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Wrong? Us?

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
There you go. You can team up with Bobby. But I don't think Bobby's looking for a partner.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
That would be hilarious.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
But he's my only friend on multiple gaming services.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Alright, let's talk about final predictions for the new Xbox.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
I guess I will start with our resident loud mouth Loki. And I say that with love.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Well, I'll tell you. We'll just start with what we're not going to see.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
We're not going to see a date other than holiday. We're not going to see a price.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
And we're not going to hear anything about DRM.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
So you can just forget about that.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
That's going to have to come with press asking follow up questions.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
They're not going to say, oh by the way use games. Nope.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I don't think they're even going to do that.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Like I said, that's going to be really weird.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Although there are some stories that make me wonder if there is something coming.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
But once again, everybody has to be on board. Not just them.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
All platforms have to be on board with it in order for it to work.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
So it's not going to happen.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
I don't even know what we're going to really see as far as new games.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
I mean, specs. They're going to show us specs.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
They may show us a box.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
I mean, if you think about it, how hard would it be for them to mock up something.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
It doesn't have to be exactly like that.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
It can change once it goes to retail, but they can mock up something.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Just have it there so that people can not bitch about it.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
And things do change before retail.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Exactly.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I think about the PlayStation 3 boomerang.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Oh yeah, the PlayStation 3.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
It's going to be 1080p at 120 frames per second.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
It's going to have 20 USB ports in the background.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
It's going to have a million USB ports and three HDMI ports or something.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
What do you even need that for?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Well, if you want to...

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
A daisy chain.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
HDMI in, HDMI audio to your receiver, and HDMI to your TV.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Whatever.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I don't know. They'll probably just talk specs.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
I think they're going to focus a lot on the entertainment stuff.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
With the whole taking over your TV, being an entertainment hub.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I just hope there's something cool.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
I just don't want to see connect, connect, connect, connect, connect.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
With the new video game console, you want to say something cool?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Yeah, I know. It's shocking.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I have decided I am going to get a new video game console this year.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I am going to buy one of those at launch.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
My money's on Wii U.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
For you, Loki.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
No. No, no, no, no.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
There could be a price cut at E3.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
It'd have to be a pretty big price cut.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
My wife played Animal Crossing today.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Or tried to get Josh to play Animal Crossing.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
That's a slippery slope right there.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Uh oh, uh oh.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
He doesn't quite get it.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
How old is Josh now?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
He's almost three.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Okay.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Slippery slope.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Let's go over to Dark Sakura.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
Dark Sakura, I know you don't totally care about things, Microsoft.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
But out of curiosity, what do you think might come of Tuesday's presentation?

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm actually going to second a lot of what Loki said.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Just because I'm sure we're not going to get a specific date.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
We're not going to get a specific price point.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
We'll get a name.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
We'll get a few screen captures of video games that are actually PC screen captures.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
More about it, you know, being for entertainment.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
The multiple use.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
You know, pictures of actor families together looking happy and waving their hands around looking stupid.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Stupid and happy. Stupid and happy people.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
You know, the name confirmation.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Just the use.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
I mean, I've seen so many Sega announcements and they've been the same.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I'm not saying, what am I saying, Sega?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Xbox announcements.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And they've been the same type of thing every year.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
I think it's just going to be their usual pattern.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I'm not going to be surprised by anything.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Cirque du Soleil this year? Space ponchos?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
No.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
No. Well, the thing was that the...

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Information-wise.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
The actual, like, tent is the space poncho.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
It's like you're in the space poncho.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
It's like meta space poncho.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Alright, anything else?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
That's what it should be.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
Hey, you guys like the hashtag so much, we now present the Xbox space poncho.

10:35.000 --> 10:42.000
And they'll have EA humping them in the background and it won't sell in Japan.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Alright, anything else you want to say about that, DarkSagra?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Alright, going to our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Some comments on Loki's possible solo podcast next week.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Loki's totally rational and not loud Nintendo critique and discussion hour.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I am 100% rational.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
And I am only... I critique because I love.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
Dark Tetsuya says, Loki's bacon pizza podcast, where do I descr...

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Where do I subscribe?

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
At the hospital when you guys all have heart attacks.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
That's where you subscribe.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
That's not going to happen.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Alright, my turn.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
So, what do I predict for Tuesday?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Definitely you're going to have the name. That's for sure.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
Finally, we can stop calling it the 720 and we'll know the real name.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Unless it is the 720, which would be hilarious.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Please, no. Please, Microsoft, no.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
We've spun around twice!

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I still vote for the lube.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I love the name Xbox the lube.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
Xbox infinity seems probable, but I do think that's more internet wank.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I think it's just simply something you haven't heard.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
My money is on Fusion. Xbox Fusion.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
You think it's on Fusion? We'll see.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Also, you will get...

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
I think they are going to one-up what Sony did and I think they will show you what it looks like.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Even though it is, of course, subject to change.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Absolutely not on the date. Absolutely not on the price.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
That will be E3.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
And I think one thing y'all need to be prepared is that there's not going to be a lot of games shown.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Because they've already pretty much come out and said, E3 is all about the games.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
And I think that's a really risky move on Microsoft's part.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Because I can just see the Twitter snark now.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Where are the games?

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Well, they did say they're going to show the Call of Duty ghost thing.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
That will be shown.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
But that's one game.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And that's a game we already kind of knew is coming.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I don't think you're going to see any bang up.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Okay, let's go to rumor wankville.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Let's go to the wankiest of wanks.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
You ready?

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
If there's a new Killer Instinct game on this Xbox, you ain't seeing it tomorrow.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
That would be an E3 surprise.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
That would be the end of the E3 presentation.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
If they're going to pull out that kind of wank, that's when that's coming.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
I want to see him do something like that and then just drop the mic at the end.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Just drop the mic and walk off the stage.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
It's like, done.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Or just fire a gun.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Shots fired, Sony.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Bam, we're out.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I think it's going to be a lot.

13:13.000 --> 13:20.000
I think it's a lot about trying to get the tech world kind of buzzed up a little bit.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
And I think you're going to see much more on the...

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
If it's true that they want to replace your cable box, which I think could be a likely thing.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I think we're going to see a lot more about that.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
And definitely, definitely interaction between Windows 8 and how you can interact with things on your PC.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
And how the PC will work as, you know, pretty much what you've already seen with Windows Media Center.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
But I think they're going to kind of bump it up a little bit.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
And Windows Phone.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Because, you know, it's all about the synergy between all those different Microsoft phones.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
It'll be all tablets and, you know, iOS.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
They know that they're limiting themselves.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
No one is going to buy a Windows Phone for the next Xbox.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
But any of that stuff?

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
The snark in you ought to be asking, will Microsoft let it last more than a year?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Or is it going to be the next Game Room?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
The next Smart Glass?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
The next HD DVD drive?

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Or on top of that, is half the stuff that they're even going to show actually going to be possible?

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Remember, hey, I'm scanning the bottom of my skateboard to bring the artwork into the game.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
Versus, hey, I'm scanning my picture so that I can get a color for my car.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And it always looks pink because the lighting in my room sucks.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
I think you will see some games.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Like a limited amount. I think it's going to be a lot of kind of what we already know about.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
And maybe like a teaser reel of stay tuned to E3 for more on this.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
You know, like a full motion video that will make no sense at the very end.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
And like, you want to see what this is? Stay tuned for E3.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
That's how it'll end or something like that.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
It'll end with Square Enix coming out.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
We're going to have, we would like to announce a game that we're going to announce at E3.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
EA will walk out on stage and go, we are going to give our full support to the next Xbox.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
We believe the next Xbox is the future of gaming and we are going to partner up with it.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
And we'll be all sitting here going, didn't we hear this before a couple years ago?

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Actually, you are correct. They will be out there.

15:20.000 --> 15:31.000
I do think that they'll actually be in the presentation because one of the rumors was supposed to be that Titan game from the X Infinity Ward guys, their new company.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Oh, the actual Titan game.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
No, the actual Titan game.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
When you say Titan, my mind goes to Horde House, Blizzard and all that.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
And I think of the Project Titan that Blizzard's doing.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
But no, it's not that.

15:42.000 --> 15:53.000
I think that we can all agree though that no matter what Microsoft says, there is going to be a shit storm on the internet immediately following.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
Absolutely, which is really interesting because I'm actually going to be out of town.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm not going to be able to watch it live or participate in the snark on Twitter.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I'm going to watch it live and I'll participate in the snark.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Of course you will.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
You should live blog it for us.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
And I already have my popcorn, so I'm all ready.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Alright.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
I'm a little sad I'm going to be having to watch it late, but I'm going to be up in Reno.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
I'm not getting up at 10am to watch this crap.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I'm busy.

16:20.000 --> 16:28.000
So, I'll have to kind of wait and see it later and have to go rewind the snark over on Twitter.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Alright.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
So, we'll see what happens.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
I'm looking at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and I'm kind of curious what you guys think is going to happen.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
ActDef says, I'm betting on Xbox Power 3 or XCube.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
It might be a little too close to GameCube.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
ShadowNextGen says, Xbox Infinity makes sense.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Turn the infinity symbol right side up and what do you get?

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
The number 8, which can tie into Windows 8.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
Here's my whole kind of like, hmm, with that though is that we have that news, was it this week or last week,

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
that there's going to move on to Windows 8.1, which is that Windows Blue they've been talking about,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
which is going to be a free upgrade for Windows 8.

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
So, it's basically like fixing the problems people have with Windows 8 to try to get more people to buy it, essentially.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
You know, like a free patch.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
So, now it's going to be 8.1.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
So, it's the band-aid.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
I guess.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
I don't know.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
Not that I disagree with what ShadowNextGen's saying, but I'm just wondering how that's going to play into it.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Windows 8, it's just a service pack.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Windows 8 service pack one now.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, but they seem to be calling it much more than a service pack, right?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
So, we'll see.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I thought they should call it the Texeract.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Why is that?

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
Because a tesseract is a fourth dimensional cube since they would have, if you were going by box to cube,

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
the next step up would be a tesseract.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
But then again, I watch way too much Cosmos.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
So, just ignore me.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Alright.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
There you go.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Those are some of the chats from live.vognetwork.com.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Because, again, we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
And it is all about letting you guys have your voice in the show.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
And I know a lot of you are going to have some reactions after Tuesday.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So, please, we want to win their fresh.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Email us.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Or you can always tweet us at OLR.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
And we're also on Facebook and Google Plus.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
So, interact with us and we'll read your comments here on the show.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you've been playing this week

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
while you wait for this next wave of game consoles to take off.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
How was your gaming week?

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
My gaming week was kind of less eventful just because I've been getting ready to leave.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I've played Ragnarok Online 2.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I'm definitely going to quit WoW.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
It's just I'm trying to find a time to log on and finish up some stuff and give people some money

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
if anyone ever went on the Alliance Guild again.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
For your money, I'll sign in to my paladin.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Give me a dollar.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
I'm not giving – I have a lot of money on my Alliance account,

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
which makes me kind of want to transfer one of my tunes over.

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
But I've been playing some Ragnarok Online 2 and Gravity is doing this sort of drawing thing

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
where you can win a prize.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Your name is entered for every hour you're logged in, so there have been a lot of vendors,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
a lot of vendors in game.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
I've been doing my weekly Mass Effect 3.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
I would call it my rant fest whilst playing.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I've been doing that.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
A Let's Play.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
That's going to come up later in the show, so it's a Let's Play basically.

19:35.000 --> 19:42.000
No, it's more or less me just doing the MST3K thing with it and telling off characters

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
and calling Udina asshole and that type of thing.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Okay, so a Let's Bitch.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
It's Mass Effect 3 Rocky Edition.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Okay.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
All right, so I've been doing that.

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
I also bought Borderlands 2 because right now I think it's still on sale on Steam.

20:01.000 --> 20:11.000
It went to some ridiculous price, like $13, so I went ahead and picked up Borderlands 2,

20:11.000 --> 20:17.000
even if it's going to make me puke my brains out from motion sickness.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Dan had such a good time playing it.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Dan also got a new racing rig.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
I saw those pictures on Facebook.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
It looks sweet.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
He's got three monitors in a little sit-down seat.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Well, he had the monitors already.

20:29.000 --> 20:36.000
They're actually three TVs because he got the hookup at work.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Okay.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
But his old rig, he had a fanatic stand and these chairs that he built out of the seats

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
from, what was it, a Honda Civic or something.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
So he actually has an actual racing rig that he bought from some guy in Reno.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
The guy came and delivered it, and it was pretty neat.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So he's got a lot of racing going on.

21:00.000 --> 21:09.000
He's looking forward to Grid 2, and so I've been indirectly participating in his racing

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
addiction by watching him and commenting and going, ugh, that car sucks.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
But that's really been the extent of my gaming.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
No, I played something else, and for the life of me, I can't remember what it was, so just

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
forget it.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Oh, yeah, Off.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I was going to say, it must not have made a big impression.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
What is Off?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I don't know if I've heard of this.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
It's a very, very weird little RPG, especially now that I can play it windowed.

21:35.000 --> 21:42.000
It's like you are sort of like controlling an avatar, and your avatar is called the Batter,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
like a guy with a bat.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
And you go around and do puzzles and talk to people, and it's bizarre.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I'll put it that way, but it's free.

21:52.000 --> 21:58.000
It was done by, crap, I forgot the name, but the original version was in French, and it's

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
been translated.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
And it's something that should be looked for.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
I'll find a link for it for the chat room, where I downloaded the translation from.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
It's a neat little game, plus also half of Tumblr loses their mind over it.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Of course.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yeah.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I've been enjoying it.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
Just like Tumblr loses their mind over the Yahoo overlords that are coming in next week,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
apparently.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Oh my god.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I am so, ugh, don't even get me started.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
But it's fun to get you started.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
You're freaking out over no news, really.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Nothing.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
They haven't done anything.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
You're just, you know, yeah, Yahoo doesn't have the best track record, but still.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
I think I made this comparison on Bobby Blackwell's show when we were doing the call at the end

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
of his show, as we always do.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
But it's kind of like Grandma taking you to a One Direction concert.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
That's what that buyout feels like.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Well, that's One Direction.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
It's a British thing.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
I thought you were up on all your Brit stuff.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
I'm not up on things that suck.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
So you do know what it is.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Alright.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
I played a whole bunch of different things this week.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So, let's see.

23:08.000 --> 23:15.000
Starting off this week, we did the VOG gaming night, Grand Theft Auto 3, or 3, Grand Theft

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Auto 4 free play.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
I promise I wanted to be there, but I drove to San Francisco to see Star Trek.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Did you play the game?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
No.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Not yet.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
So we just kind of hung out.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
We were going to try to join other people's free mode games.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
It was just a big combat fest, and we didn't really want to shoot each other, which is

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
kind of, you know, anti-Grand Theft Auto, but we were just messing around.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
So we went to the swing set of evil, or death, or whatever you want to call it, and we're

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
launching cars out of that.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
And that was kind of fun.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
We messed around with that a little bit.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
And then, let's see what else.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, and for next week, I have no idea what we're going to play.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
So, anyone has any suggestions on what you want to play?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
That'd be fantastic.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
And also, I'm thinking about maybe toying with the idea of changing the night from Thursday

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
to Friday, because I know it gets kind of late, especially when we're starting at 8

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
o'clock on the East Coast.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I mean, on Thursday night, it's a little odd.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
But maybe Friday, we'll see.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Also have video capture equipment, finally.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I got an Elgato Game Capture HD.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
Ooh, you have to tell me how that works, because I really want to get something for the living

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
room here to do that type of thing.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah, it looks pretty simple, so I'll have to mess with that.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
And then, okay, so back to the games.

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
So I had the urge this week to play Command & Conquer Red Alert, like the first one.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
And so I was going to go buy it from Amazon, because they have their sale going.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
And then I was doing some searching, and it's freeware.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
So I downloaded it for free, which is fantastic.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
That's the best price.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
And so I installed it, had to add some different patches to it to get to work in Windows 7.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
And the first thing I had to do, mod it, because that's what I do.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I play modded games.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
So I messed with the rules I and I filed to mod kind of how I had it before.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
I had a really cool setup back in the day when I was playing it with all these custom

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
units I made and stuff.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
So I kind of remembered some of that and put it back in there.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
So I played a skirmish game last night.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
It took about two hours, just because I was toying with the computer.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I wasn't immediately going for the kill.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
I was just letting them kind of live a little bit.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
But it was pretty fun.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
I had a lot of fun with it.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
It still runs like shit, though, on my computer, which is weird,

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
because it's such an old game you'd think with the processor being so fast that it should

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
be able to run a little faster than it did, but whatever.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
So I played that.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
And then, since I can talk about it this week, Metro Last Light.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
I played that last week.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
And it's fantastic.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
I was going to say, you gave it a very favorable review over at VOG Network.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Yeah, it's fantastic.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
See, my laptop is not very...

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I mean, the graphics card is not great.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
I ran everything in that game on low visual settings, but I never noticed.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I mean, it looked just like the console version.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
I mean, apparently it has really good visuals, but you have to have a pretty decent graphics card,

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
and I'm kind of limited.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
I can't upgrade my graphics card in my laptop.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
You weren't the only one that seemed to enjoy it.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
I'm seeing a lot on the internet, a lot of good reviews of that game.

26:23.000 --> 26:29.000
But yeah, it reminded me a lot of Bioshock Infinite, just with kind of the different story elements.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
It's very linear.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Bioshock was very linear.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
There's a little bit of like, okay, you can do this, you can do that differently.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
You can do a lot of stealth in the game, which is kind of cool.

26:43.000 --> 26:51.000
You can take out lights, and a lot of the lights thing plays into the stealth stuff.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
So there's a mode that's pretty difficult.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
You can actually play the whole game without killing anybody, except for the mutants.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
You have to kill the mutants because they'll just charge right at you.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
You can't walk past them.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
But there's an achievement you get for doing that.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
And I don't know, I just enjoyed it.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
I enjoyed the storyline.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
I haven't played 2033.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
I have 2033, so I should probably check it out,

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
although now I've had the ending spoiled because they kind of give it away at the end of this game,

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
because it ties in with it.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
But yeah, it was a really great game.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
I'm glad I got to play it because I wasn't really familiar with the series at all,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
and it's pretty awesome.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
So definitely worth checking out.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
And I know a lot of people might want to wait until a sale comes.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
And if it's anything like the other Deep Silver games, it'll be deeply discounted pretty soon,

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
because they really knock the prices off their games pretty quick.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
And just a quick plug, since you did bring up the review that you did for this game.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
If you check out his review over at vognetwork.com,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
and I noticed for the live listeners, Bobby put that in chat,

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
but it's really easy to find if you just go to vognetwork.com.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
The really cool thing about the way the website is built over at VOG Network,

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
or the voice engaged network, is that you can actually do a response review.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
So if you also like the game, or maybe you didn't like the game and you want to have your say on that,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
you can actually write a response review.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
And the way it's done is that we actually screen the reviews to make sure they're not trolly,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
to make sure they are thought out,

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
to make sure they're worthy of posting right underneath the main review.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
And we never judge that on opinion, whether you love it or hate it.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
We just want to make sure it sounds like you've actually played it,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
and that you're not just first.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
It's not like a Metacritic thing where you're like, one, ten.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Exactly. It has to be a little more thought out than that.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
So we will, of course, approve those, and you get your review right there,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
right underneath the main review.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
And it's pretty cool, and one of the things that makes our site really unique, which I like.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
So you only have a limited amount of time to do that, though.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
I don't remember what it is. Bobby, you'll have to remind me.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I think it's like two weeks or a month.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
We do that on movies. I know a lot of you have been seeing Iron Man 3, Star Trek Into Darkness.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Both those movies are also reviewed on our site, and you can participate with that.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
And then the other things I played on the Ouya.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I've been playing a lot of stuff on the Ouya.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
I've actually been playing a lot of the Pingo puzzle poker.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
It's like this cross between poker and bingo.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
And I can't beat my high score, though.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
And she keeps extending. They have a high score contest going on right now.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
And she keeps extending it out.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
It's now June 15th is when that expires, because there's not a lot of people participating.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
But man, I have a 591,000 score that good luck anyone beating that.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
Because I've been playing every day, and I can't beat that.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I got close. I got 491 the other day.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
So I believe that. It's pretty fun.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I was trying some other games.

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
I've been doing a lot of these quick looks at different games on the Ouya.

29:51.000 --> 29:57.000
And I've actually been posting quite a bit on my YouTube channel, which is just LokiOLR.

29:57.000 --> 30:05.000
And I've been noticing a lot of problems with those analog dead zones.

30:05.000 --> 30:12.000
I wasn't noticing it originally, but man, they're bad on those early controllers.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
It's just not...

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
You try to turn diagonal, and your character slows down,

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
because it's like you're not pushing very far in the analog stick.

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
But I played this amazing frog or something like that.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
And the volume on it...

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
They have these boomboxes in the game, and the audio is so fucking loud.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
It's ridiculous.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I had to shut the game off. It's actually funny if you watch the video.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
I shut it off because it was so goddamn loud on the game.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
I had the volume on. The TV wasn't that loud, because I've been playing other games in it.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
The audio of those boomboxes is just so fucking ridiculous.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
I was like, I'm gonna try to smash this thing.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
But it was kind of fun.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Some random comments from our chat room.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Shadownextgen agreeing with you.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Vector on Ouya is a lot of fun.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
And Bobby is in chat clarifying something I brought up earlier.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
You can actually respond to reviews at any time.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
I made a mistake. I confused it with another feature of the site that technically is also open all the time.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
It just doesn't give you rewards after a certain point on vognetwork.com.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
But reviews? Always open.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
So that's really cool.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
So you can check that out whenever.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
I know.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
Well, our site is just so intricate and awesome that I forget things.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
It's too complicated.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Nice save.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
I need a user manual.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Nice save.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I need a user manual.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Anything else for your gaming week, Logie?

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
I think that's it for this week.

31:32.000 --> 31:41.000
But yeah, seriously though, there's a topic on the gaming section on the VoG forums for the gaming night stuff.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Let me know what games you guys want to play.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
It doesn't have to be on Xbox 360.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
It's just it's been that way for the last couple times.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
PC, PS3, whatever you guys have.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Whatever you want to play.

31:51.000 --> 31:57.000
You know, obviously pick a game or consider games that allow a lot of people to play.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Like Saints Row the third multiplayer.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Not going to work because it's only two people.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
It'd be fun, but you just can't really do that.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
So something that is preferably free.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
Like Team Fortress 2 was one that I thought of because I haven't played that and it's free.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Going into my gaming week, I actually got to that point where I was kind of bored.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
So I was going through random games on Steam and I even went into Team Fortress 2.

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
But I only did like single player stuff like tutorials and bots and things on my own.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
But yeah, I would actually love to try Team Fortress 2.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
Kind of like a I think we should have a noob night on Team Fortress 2.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
Like no shame and like people that are a little more experienced.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Like I know Act F actually plays a little bit like they could be the coaches.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
So we can have like a no shame noob night on Team Fortress 2 I think would be a lot of fun.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
Because I would like to see something like that for League of Legends and Dota.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
I need a friendly warm environment to help me learn some of those games.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
As opposed to the mean assholes that make up a lot of the League of Legends community.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
That'd be my mode.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
You know one of the games I've been looking at.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Like one of the sale things that they have on Amazon right now.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Speaking of games to get into and stuff.

33:01.000 --> 33:07.000
They have Civ 5 Gold with some other thing on there.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
And then XCOM for like 20 bucks.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
Pull the trigger. It's great. Civ 5 is great.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I think Civ 4 is also in there.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Oh nice. Well Civ 4 was a great game too.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
But Civ 5 is awesome.

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
And that would also be a game that would make a great night sometime.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
That is going to have to be an OLR weekend game.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Anyway.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
Going into other games I've been playing this week.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
A lot of the Warcraft stuff is starting to die down a little bit as all my friends are leaving.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I'm still playing it now and again.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
But mostly just log in.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Do a daily dungeon and a daily PVP.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
And then that's about it for right now.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
But with the patch 5.3 coming soon I imagine I'll be playing more World of Warcraft.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
But some of the games I've been checking out in the interim.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
As I mentioned before I did check out Team Fortress 2.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
I actually went into Star Trek Online for a little bit.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
I think seeing the movie kind of put me in a mood where I'm like,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I need to check out Star Trek Online again.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
It's been a long time since I played it.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
And you know it's free to play online through Steam so it's very easy to download and set up.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
I had some weird issues just trying to launch the game.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
Like I sat there on a loading screen for, I kid you not, five minutes.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Timed it.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
The game's really gone to crap since they made it free to play.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Really? That's too bad.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
You know I logged in and I was playing for a little bit.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I had fun with the character creation.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
Kind of making a little guy that...

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
I want to say it looks like me but it ended up looking like Riker.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
But I've also been told that I look like Riker with red hair.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
So I don't know what to tell you.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
I don't see it.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
I think it's the beard.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
It must be the beard.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
But yeah, whatever.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
So I made my guy and I had fun doing the little tutorial.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
But I had to go somewhere else so I didn't get to play.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
I didn't get to actually interact with other people so that was that.

34:54.000 --> 34:59.000
But they changed the beginning of the game from what I remember.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
Because I remember the beginning of the game used to be narrated by Zachary Quinto.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And now they have Leonard Nimoy doing it.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
That was interesting.

35:06.000 --> 35:12.000
Well no, the beginning was always narrated by Leonard Nimoy.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Quinto does the tutorial battle.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
He's the EMH.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Oh, okay.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Oh, okay.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Okay.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Alright, got it.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Yeah.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
But they changed so much and it's not fun anymore.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Why is that?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Or what is...

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
I don't know enough about the game just from playing the tutorial.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
They changed the skill trees.

35:31.000 --> 35:37.000
Like they completely redid the skill setup for how you assign and do your points and

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
your various weapons that you can pick up for your different classes.

35:42.000 --> 35:49.000
Because my normal class is an engineer and I always do the, what are they called, the

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
fast ships, the little small fast ships.

35:52.000 --> 35:58.000
But every time I would log in, my skills would be completely reset.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
So I'd have to reassign all of my skills.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
And then I'd change it a third time.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
So I was like, you know what, this isn't even worth it to me to have to sit and go through.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Because keep in mind, my character right now is a Rear Admiral.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
And it just took forever to get everything.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
And I also had like the middle level account because I had stopped paying my subscription,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
but I had been paying a subscription.

36:20.000 --> 36:26.000
So it was just, all I did last time I played was hang out at Deep Space Nine and play Dabo.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Seriously, that's all I did.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
Tigerclaw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com reminding us, Star Trek Online has a new DLC

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
pack called Legacy of Romulus.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Yes, I did notice that.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
It's all over the splash screens when you log into the game.

36:39.000 --> 36:45.000
Some other folks in chat, a variety of people talking about the Star Trek game that just came out on 360 PS3

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
and the negative reception it's getting.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
I seen Shadow Next Gen in chat saying, stay away, far, far away.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
So apparently it's not good.

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
That's too bad because I remember they pushed it back to tie in with the new movie as opposed to the last Blu-Ray.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
So, uh oh.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Let's see, other stuff I played this week.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
Believe it or not, I went back to Diablo 3 and played quite a bit of that.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
You guys might remember I picked it up again very randomly a couple months ago,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
but then I kind of like fell off the wagon and didn't play for a bit.

37:13.000 --> 37:22.000
Well, I read somewhere they were doing a 25% increased XP and magic gold find weekend

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
because this is the one year anniversary of Diablo 3 coming out.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
So I was like, what the hell, I'll go take a look.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
And I actually played enough, I finally beat the damn game.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
A year later, finally beat Diablo 3.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
I killed Diablo and I'll tell you what, you'll have to ask Alan about this,

37:38.000 --> 37:44.000
but I had so much rage during that Diablo fight because the game is not that hard.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Like it's just click, click, kill, kill, kill.

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
You know, especially if you're finding the good items and using the auction house, not real money.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
I don't use real money, but I use the gold auction house to find good deals on gear and stuff.

37:55.000 --> 38:03.000
And I had some really good gear, but when I got to the last act, when I got to the second half of Act 4,

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
I can't even start a kick in my ass. I got a lot harder.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
And when I finally got to the Diablo fight, I think I had to fight him like seven times before I got it.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
It was as intricate as a raid fight in World of Warcraft.

38:14.000 --> 38:20.000
Like you have to, you know, don't stand in the black, watch out for his beam that's going to go clockwise

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
and make sure when the shadow does the attack it doesn't hit you.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Like you have to be watching for all this stuff.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
So it was a very unforgiving fight.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
So yeah, but I beat him. I didn't need any help.

38:30.000 --> 38:37.000
So I finally, and you guys might remember, I said I wanted to play Diablo 3 once by myself, no people helping me,

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
which a couple of people on my friends list got a little butthurt that I didn't want to play Diablo 3 with them.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
But I said a long time ago I was going to do that and I was going to play it through

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
because one of my friends was like, let me help you kill Diablo. Let me help you kill Diablo.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
And I'm like, no. But I did it.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
So now I'm going to explore some of the multiplayer stuff.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
That's the next thing I want to do in Diablo and move on to the nightmare difficulty or whatever.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
Because the one negative I will say with that is that Diablo 3 kind of has a shitty ending.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
Like you get the little full motion video movie, which I guess is cool and so forth.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
And then it's like, well, you beat it on this difficulty. Now play again.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Was it worth the blood pact?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Huh?

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Was it worth the blood pact?

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
Well, yeah, because I played enough WoW and I got Diablo 3 for free. So it's hard to bitch.

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
And to be fair, maybe the ending is like it gets better when you play it on the higher difficulties.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
Because you can play it through like four different difficulties, right? And then hardcore.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
So, you know, I don't know.

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
But anyway, I thought because I never beat games, I thought y'all could appreciate I did finally, finally beat Diablo 3.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Hooray.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
And that was pretty much my gaming week.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
So, quick housekeeping. We may not have a show next week.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
In fact, I'm going to say right now it's very likely we will not have a show next week.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
Stay tuned to Twitter for updates though. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

39:57.000 --> 40:05.000
We will let you know mid-week because we do want to do something about the Xbox thing on Tuesday and getting some immediate reactions to that.

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
I do want to plug our Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Orange Radio.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And of course, Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

40:12.000 --> 40:19.000
And also, I thought we would take an opportunity and plug some of the Twitch TV live streaming we've been doing.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
I've been doing it all on the main O-L-R channel, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
And I'm going to try to convince Loki to move there.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
That's fine. I only did it once.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Right now, you're streaming where?

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
I think it's all – it's loki O-L-R on Twitch.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
But now, Jamie, you do some more personal projects where you're doing sketching and things like that.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
So, you do have your own Twitch channel for that. Where's that at?

40:38.000 --> 40:44.000
It's kurotsubasa, K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
And – but I'm actually thinking about making an actual live stream account just for the drawing.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Nice.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
Because Twitch is more for gaming.

40:54.000 --> 41:03.000
And to be honest though, I'm probably going to be taking a little bit of a break from doing the hardcore projects because I finally, finally finished my FemShep project.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
How many FemShep drawings did you end up doing?

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Twenty-two.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Twenty-two. Wow.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Two of them were mine.

41:10.000 --> 41:18.000
But yeah, they're all done and they are on Mass Effecting, my Tumblr for all things Mass Effect.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
Well, then maybe we'll have to get your gaming stuff on the O-L-R channel as well.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
And then we'll have all those subscribers still built in from the days we used to do the show over there.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
That'd be nice.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
That'd be nice. All right.

41:28.000 --> 41:36.000
But for now, let's – because when we're off a week, that's – the live streaming is a really good way to kind of keep tabs on us during the week.

41:36.000 --> 41:43.000
We do make sure that we're streaming when there is not other programming at the Voice Geeks Network, which we always try to promote the other great independent shows.

41:43.000 --> 41:50.000
Everything from TVs to movies to anime to British stuff to American stuff to Australian stuff.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
It's all at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
Let's get into gaming news, of which there was a surprising amount of it this week.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
Although I guess we are getting in those weeks leading up to E3, so more and more is going to come up.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Only a couple weeks away, so.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
All right, Loki.

42:05.000 --> 42:11.000
So EA shockingly announced that they are putting an end to their online pass program.

42:11.000 --> 42:21.000
And basically saying, yes, we are discontinuing online pass and none of our EA titles will feature – or include that feature.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Ha, feature. That's funny.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Yeah, feature.

42:24.000 --> 42:32.000
It's as many players didn't respond to the format and, you know, we've listened to feedback and decided to do away with it moving forward.

42:33.000 --> 42:41.000
Which makes me think what the hell is coming up that we don't know about that's going to take the place of this because –

42:41.000 --> 42:47.000
I think a lot of people had that reaction as there's that initial celebration, the Kermit flail, yay!

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
The EA got rid of the online pass, like they realized it was a really off-putting idea.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
But then it's like, wait a minute, this can only get worse.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
EA is not coming to go, hey guys, we were wrong, sorry.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
Hey, hey, you know that SimCity, we should have made it offline.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Here's a patch to make it offline.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
They're not going to do that.

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
It's going to have something that's being done by the console manufacturer to take the place of this.

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
The money is going to come from somewhere and I wonder – well, even if it's not necessarily that whole thing that it's –

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Microtransactions?

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I think it's increased DLC.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
I think that's where they're going to make – and remember this point because I'm going to bring it up again later in the show.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
We get into something else involving EA.

43:28.000 --> 43:33.000
But I think the whole DLC and the microtransactions is how they're going to make up the money.

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
I think you're going to see more games that really rely on that to make their – why not?

43:38.000 --> 43:44.000
It works for Facebook and free-to-play games and a lot of companies unfortunately are moving into that dangerous space where it's like,

43:45.000 --> 43:52.000
oh, well, people – the consumer wants to play a Facebook game and they want to buy all these little free tools and energy packs.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
They got rid of that. They got out of that though.

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
And I don't know. There's a part of me that's like that's got to be something.

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
I don't doubt that they're going to charge you $60 for a game and have a bunch of crappy DLC for it.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Or some good DLC, but probably a lot of crappy DLC.

44:07.000 --> 44:13.000
Do you think that possibly the relationship with GameStop came into this?

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
Do you think maybe GameStop maybe choked a bitch, so to speak?

44:17.000 --> 44:25.000
And GameStop might have been like, you know, our retail people don't really push your games because you don't get the same value out of that.

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
And we kind of like to push the 2K sports games that don't have the online passes.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
I don't even know if that would have really – I think that maybe they just found that they weren't making a whole ton of money off of it.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
Maybe they think that their games are so awesome that people are just buying them new anyways.

44:40.000 --> 44:47.000
Although, I don't know. It's just – it's weird. I don't know really what they would be thinking.

44:47.000 --> 44:55.000
But do I think other publishers are going to follow suit because, you know, hey, EA did it and so everybody else started doing it? No.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
I mean, if you already think about it, you have one less studio that's going to be doing that.

44:59.000 --> 45:07.000
Deep Silver not following suit with like THQ's decision to do online passes for their games, so you're not going to see it through them.

45:07.000 --> 45:14.000
I don't think Take-Two's doing that for WWE 2K14, so you're not going to have that happening.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
Really, the only companies left would be Ubisoft.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
Well, Warner Games, they still might do that.

45:23.000 --> 45:33.000
But, you know, really their next big game coming out is, you know, Batman Arkham Origins, which doesn't have an online component.

45:33.000 --> 45:43.000
But last time with Arkham Asylum, they had the whole Catwoman DLC, which was the sort of online pass, pre-order bonus, whatever you want to call it.

45:45.000 --> 45:53.000
And then, so yeah, Ubisoft and Sony, really, Sony first party would be the, you know, the other ones that have that in there.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
Dark Sakura, what do you think about the whole EA getting rid of the online pass?

45:59.000 --> 46:08.000
I think it's a, I mean, a smart move for one thing, but I think that they're going to replace it with something more nefarious.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
I trust EA as far as I can pick up their entire headquarter building and push it.

46:14.000 --> 46:23.000
Well, I think this is a good excuse to check in with the listeners here for a minute, and I think we're going to do a live poll.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
How's that sound?

46:24.000 --> 46:33.000
Alright, we're going to go to vognetwork.com, and specifically live.vognetwork.com, and we're going to ask our question of the live listeners.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
And tonight's question is, why did EA get rid of the online pass?

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
And here's some of the options collected from what the hosts have said so far.

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
They are truly trying to look less evil. There's something about the new consoles.

46:46.000 --> 46:53.000
They're going to rely on increased DLC. GameStop put them in a chokehold, or something else.

46:53.000 --> 47:01.000
You can vote now. Register participants at live.vognetwork.com will see the poll up there on the site and can vote right now.

47:01.000 --> 47:07.000
And you'll see that under the chat box at live.vognetwork.com. We'll go over those results there in just a minute.

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
The cool thing is that once you vote, you can actually see the results come in live.

47:12.000 --> 47:18.000
And so far, everybody is saying there's something about the new consoles, dot, dot, dot.

47:18.000 --> 47:26.000
But see, they've already talked about the PlayStation 4, and they've said that there's nothing preventing used games.

47:26.000 --> 47:31.000
So I don't know if there is going to be anything with new consoles.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
Maybe they just decided, hey, you know what? We're just not making a ton of money off of this.

47:36.000 --> 47:42.000
Although, I thought they said they were making quite a bit of money. So why would you just get rid of money, or give up on that?

47:42.000 --> 47:48.000
Exactly. I mean, is it really that much of a trying to save face after what happened with SimCity? I don't...

47:48.000 --> 47:56.000
Because people are kind of expecting that. Anyways, maybe... I don't know. I don't really know what their thought process could be.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
I guess we'll find out. We're definitely not going to find out on Tuesday.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
They're not going to say, hey, by the way, we're going to have a feature that's going to prevent you from buying used games.

48:03.000 --> 48:09.000
Yeah, the negative stuff, or anything that can be perceived as negative, that's not coming out on Tuesday.

48:09.000 --> 48:15.000
They're not going to come out on stage and say, oh yeah, this Xbox has to always be online, or you'll get kicked off.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
That's not something they would ever say. That's something that will have to get yanked out of them.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
I think it would be cool if they did address all those, like if they had actual responses that were positive.

48:23.000 --> 48:29.000
Like, it's not always online. We've heard your worries, and it's not.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
All the guy talking, all the talking head would have to do is get up there and say, you know,

48:35.000 --> 48:40.000
and don't worry, if I lose my internet connection, I can still play the game.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
So, stop tweeting about it. You know, or just make a little joke about it.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
Like, that's all they would need to do. And everybody could laugh it off.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
Like an old sitcom at the end. Anyhow.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
Alright, let's see. I'm going to check the results here.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
Still 58% of the vote. There's something about the new consoles.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
No votes for games? Stop putting them in a chokehold, though. People don't think that seems to be it.

49:02.000 --> 49:08.000
So, a large amount of people as well. 30%. They're going to rely on increased DLC.

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
About 8% right now saying they are truly trying to look less evil.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
So, 8% giving them the benefit of the doubt there.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
So, we'll see. I'll check in with that poll one more time after this story.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
Give you guys a last chance to vote there at live.vognetwork.com.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
This is getting a little bit of controversy this week.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
This story that's going around about a game that isn't even out here in America,

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
but a lot of people here have an opinion on it.

49:30.000 --> 49:36.000
The game is in Japan only. Nintendo of Japan makes this series called Tomodachi Collection New Life.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
This is a game that's on the 3DS.

49:38.000 --> 49:45.000
And from my understanding of the game, I'm not going to confess to know a whole lot about this game,

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
but it's kind of Nintendo's answer to the Sims slash Animal Crossing.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
And it uses Miis and it's one of those life simulation type of games.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
Well, apparently there is a glitch in the game.

49:59.000 --> 50:06.000
And according to some people in Japan, what happens with the glitch is that the glitch enables same sex marriages to appear.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
And what you do, you bring your Miis over to the 3DS using the Miis transfer tool,

50:10.000 --> 50:18.000
and somehow this glitch will allow your character to bathe with characters of the same gender,

50:18.000 --> 50:28.000
make babies, defy the laws of science and everything, and raise babies and all that stuff with the whole same gender.

50:28.000 --> 50:34.000
And obviously, places like Tumblr are very, and the story actually says this,

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
Hey, it's true though, places like Tumblr and some of the fan sites are very happy about this,

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
and posting their pictures of their happy little gay family and so forth.

50:42.000 --> 50:50.000
And you know, obviously as a gay guy myself, I like to see a lot of this stuff that's positive in games.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
And I love the way The Sims does it. The Sims is a great model.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
It's like one of those games where it's like, you know, The Sims just will like whatever they like.

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
Whatever you want them to like. There's just no rules or things like that.

51:04.000 --> 51:11.000
But in this game it's unfortunately unintended, and they're going to patch it out.

51:11.000 --> 51:18.000
The patch in the near future will fix some other bugs that happen because of the same sex marriages.

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
Because the same sex marriages will lead to the inability to boot up the game,

51:22.000 --> 51:28.000
the inability to save, getting a notice on home menus notification that a child will be sent on a journey,

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
but no actual message is there. That's clearly something in the game that I don't know much about,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
because I don't know the series very well.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
But a lot of people...

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Since they're taking the Republican route, you know.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
Well, here's the thing. There's a lot of people out there that are like,

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
and you know the way games journalism works where it's copy paste, copy paste,

51:45.000 --> 51:51.000
but make the headline more sensationalist each time is that Nintendo bans same sex marriage from their game.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
You know, or something. It's...

51:53.000 --> 52:02.000
Okay, maybe the way this really is is that Nintendo didn't plan to put same sex marriage in their game.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
It ended up there anyway through a bug, which will also cause save files to corrupt and so forth,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
so they've got to do something about it.

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
You know, I don't think they're necessarily trying to patch out the gay marriage,

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
but that wasn't supposed to be there in the first place.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
So I'm not as upset about this as you might think.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
I mean, again, I'm gay myself and I like to see this stuff in games,

52:21.000 --> 52:27.000
but I also realize a lot of Japanese games don't have gay marriage stuff in their games.

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
Final Fantasy XI, you could marry in that game, but they didn't do same gender weddings.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
It was something they were thinking about or whatever, but they never did it.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I was like that for Ragnarok Online.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Did they do same genders in Ragnarok?

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
Yeah, they did. You had like marriage skills.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
Like if you married your character, you could teleport to wherever your character was

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
or do like healing stuff.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
But they didn't have it to where it would be same gendered,

52:54.000 --> 53:01.000
and people who took private servers actually had to modify some of the programming in the game to enable it.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says,

53:03.000 --> 53:09.000
From what I read of the story, the fix is only for the problems with the side effects caused by the glitch.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
And that would be a great way to kind of resolve this scenario,

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
so that way it's like, okay, if people kind of figured out how to work the system

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
and get two guys in there, then whatever.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
And I think that's a good way to do it.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
And I think we are headed in the right direction, folks, culturally.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
Like I look at games like Mass Effect, and yes, I know here I am bringing up that game again,

53:29.000 --> 53:35.000
but guys, it's done so well in that series that there's a reason why I really love Mass Effect.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
And games like The Sims and other games.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
And you look at what's happening culturally is that, what did we have?

53:40.000 --> 53:47.000
Three states that went for same-sex marriage in the past, what, two weeks or something like that?

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
Like, you know, the times are changing.

53:50.000 --> 53:57.000
And, you know, eventually this is something that when the culture changes,

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
the games that are commentary on culture, such as a game like Tomodachi Collection,

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
will update to reflect that as well.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
But, you know, for right now, I don't believe gay marriage is legal in Japan,

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
so it's probably why they didn't think to really put it in there as a fully fleshed out thing,

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
and why it is still kind of a bug that the two guys actually make the baby.

54:18.000 --> 54:24.000
Which, you know, you would, obviously is not biologically possible,

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
although certainly there are many, many, many, many other ways for gay couples,

54:28.000 --> 54:34.000
both male and female, to adopt a baby or have a surrogate or whatever to do that.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
You do know science is working on that, right?

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
I wouldn't doubt it, and there was the whole pregnant man thing a while ago, but that's, you know-

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Biolog- physically.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Right.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Female parts.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Right.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
And a dude.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Right. Biologically.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Yes.

54:50.000 --> 54:58.000
But they actually are working on using cloning technology so that two people of the same gender can have a child together.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Mm-hmm.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
So, just kidding. Science?

55:01.000 --> 55:06.000
So, I think generally, culturally, and I'm not trying to get too political on this show,

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
but obviously, you know, it's an issue that's kind of important to me.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
It's one of those things where it's like, you know, it's more and more becoming not a big fucking deal,

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
and that's really what this should be, is it's not a big fucking deal

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
if two guys want to do something that doesn't affect your life whatsoever, you know what I mean?

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
It's just, you know.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
So, what do you think, DarkSakura, about this Tomodachi collection?

55:30.000 --> 55:36.000
I think people are just, I think, unfortunately, the sensationalism of certain gaming websites and so forth

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
tended to make this story a bigger deal than it is,

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
but I think certainly there's got to be Nintendo kind of looking at this going,

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
oh, well, I guess if people are going to have these tumblers and so forth about it,

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
maybe this is something we should have thought of putting into their first place.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Anna, what do you think, Jamie?

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
Uh, I think it should have been there from the get-go.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Mm-hmm.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
And if it's possible, I mean, clearly the glitch is causing some problems,

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
and I have no problem with them fixing those effects of the glitch,

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
but I would want them to see them leave in the option, actually even make it,

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
if they could incorporate some way to make that a regular feature in the game,

56:11.000 --> 56:17.000
instead of just it being a glitch, and using that to fix the problems,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
then that would be the way I would go.

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
And I would also request that they actually bring this game over to America,

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
so I can feel like I know what the fuck I'm talking about with this game,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
because I'm going to be honest, I don't.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
I can only really go off of screenshots and little YouTubes

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
and things I see of the game and my assumptions.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
I would play it.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
Yeah, I'd like to know a little more about what this game is in the first place.

56:40.000 --> 56:45.000
Well, Tomogachi means friend, so it's buddy game.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
All right.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
All right, well, let's move on.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Oh, quickly, I'm going to close out the poll here.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Here's the final results of our poll.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
The winner, why did EA get rid of the online pass?

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
57% of the vote.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
There's something about the new consoles.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
Second place, they're going to rely on increased DLC.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
So there you go.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Those are the results of the live poll.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Thank you guys for voting at live.vognetwork.com.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
Let's move on to the next story, DarkSakura.

57:10.000 --> 57:16.000
In other news, now, this is probably why I've had Sega on the brain for a little while,

57:16.000 --> 57:22.000
is Sega is, well, we've always known that Sega's been in bed with Nintendo.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
We have no idea what they're doing in this bed, but they're doing stuff.

57:26.000 --> 57:35.000
In this case, Sega has announced that they are in an exclusive partnership with Nintendo of America.

57:35.000 --> 57:41.000
They are gay married to Nintendo, having clone babies in the form of a hedgehog.

57:42.000 --> 57:49.000
Basically, Nintendo consoles are going to be exclusive for the next three Sonic the Hedgehog titles.

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
And they put out the announcement via Nintendo Direct during the week.

57:54.000 --> 58:00.000
And they've only put out the names of the first two titles.

58:00.000 --> 58:06.000
The third one is still to be announced, but these are Wii U and 3DS.

58:06.000 --> 58:12.000
They're saying that it would be the ideal platform, that's a quote, to showcase Sonic.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
Of course, though, since people aren't buying Wii U's,

58:16.000 --> 58:22.000
Sega is once again showing that their business sense is kind of in the US.

58:22.000 --> 58:29.000
And this is Sega of America and Sega Europe. I didn't see the official Sega of Japan.

58:29.000 --> 58:36.000
Is this really a big deal, though? Because, I mean, Sonic games, not known for their quality these days so much.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
They've had several Sonic games that have been exclusive to the Nintendo platform.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Sonic Colors, Sonic and the Secret Rings.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
Mario and Sonic in the Olympics, which sells really well. Those games sell very well.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
Yeah.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
Yeah.

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
Which they're doing another, which is one of those three games they're doing, which makes sense.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
But yeah, but that also, it sold well because the Wii sold well, right?

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Yeah, definitely.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
But the Wii U is not.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
Well, that's going to suck for Sega then, I guess.

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
Because Sega's really had, especially Sega of America, had a great track record.

59:13.000 --> 59:19.000
I wish they'd come out and said it's going to be Phantasy Star Online 2 that's going to be on the Wii U.

59:19.000 --> 59:24.000
That would have given me something to get really excited about, which I'm surprised something like that isn't happening.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Well, you never know. E3 might be interesting.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
Speaking of which, Rob, you need to play that with me on PC.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Is there an English patch yet for that?

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
Yeah, it's mostly English. It's English enough that you could be able to play it.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I might have to do that. We'll see.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
It's actually super fun. It's exactly like the last one, so it's good.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
Shadow Next Gen in our chat room with an interesting perspective saying,

59:44.000 --> 59:52.000
Rob, with Nintendo helping to work on Sonic now though, maybe it will have that magic Nintendo polish that a lot of first party Nintendo titles have.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
Could Nintendo's involvement make this sweeter?

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And actually I do have to make a slight rebuttal, which I've said in the chat room.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Sonic Generations was pretty damn good.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Okay, fair enough.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
But it was also out on multiple platforms.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And I got it on PC. It's fun on PC.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
So I don't think it's going to make a difference. It just has to not be a turd of a game.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
You know, like, what was the last really big turd in the Sonic franchise?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Sonic Adventure 2? No, Sonic Adventure 2 was okay. The first Sonic Adventure was good.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Sonic 4.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Sonic 4.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Yeah.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
It was a huge turd.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Yeah.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:40.000
It didn't even do much in the way of being fun. It just wasn't.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Tigerclaw theorizes in our chat room, what if part of the deal with Sega was that one of the Nintendo characters makes a cameo somewhere in the new Sonic game?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Oh boy.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Do you think that plumber can run that fast?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Anything's possible. Anything's possible.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Alright, so we will see what happens with this partnership.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Some other stuff coming out of the Nintendo Direct though. Loki?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Yeah, they finally announced a date for Wonderful 101, which is on September 15th in North America and August 23rd in Europe.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And that's all they said about it. So fantastic.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Also, Super Luigi U, the DLC is arriving on the 20th of June.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And then if you don't want to get it as DLC, you can pay an extra $10 and get a standalone disc, which is coming out August 25th.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I think the reason they're doing that is just to say, hey look, we have games coming out for the Wii U.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Because I don't know why else it would do that.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I kind of figured they would do that later on when they do a game of the year edition of New Super Mario Brothers with New Luigi U.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Because again, not every household in America is online.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Granted, if you're not online but you have a Wii U, I'm not sure how that works.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000
You must live in a real remote part of the US or something, but I think there's enough people without online that justify it.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Also, the Wii U could be in a kid's bedroom, which maybe doesn't have online or something, you know?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I guess. But they're putting it out, so I guess that's kind of cool.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
And then last but not least, this is kind of neat because I'm not going to E3.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
So you get to play unreleased Wii U games at Best Buy during E3.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
They're going to have demo kiosks at over 100 locations.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And I guess it's going to be happening starting June 9th.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And no idea what games are going to be there.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I think, I want to say that the Mario and Sonic at the Olympics is going to be there and New Luigi U.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And then, don't know about the other stuff.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
But they're going to have some games there.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So I actually probably will go check that out just because I don't get to go to E3.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Very interesting how Nintendo is really changing up the E3 strategy this year.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I mean, granted, we had a couple years ago, and I think this still happens to some extent,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Microsoft, I remember one year, went very big on bringing E3 home where you could download all the demos and so forth.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I really wish they would do that. That was awesome. That was in 2006.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And it was fantastic because it's like, hey, we just showed you this awesome Lost Planet game.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Now you can go download it.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And then download them for MotoGP. They have like three or four games on there.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And that was awesome. And now they don't do that anymore.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I mean, I really wish they would do that because a lot of, well, the majority of the people that are paying attention to E3 can't go to that.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Why do you think Nintendo is making you go to Best Buy and not just letting you download them to your Wii U?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Partnership.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I bet it's part partnership and it's also part so you can get the sales pitch while you're there about picking up a Wii U.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Because, you know, Nintendo has, just like Microsoft and just like any other company, has the people that go out to the stores.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Well, they're trying to sell the console too because the problem isn't getting people that own the Wii U to buy more games.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
It's getting people to buy the Wii U.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Right. So why not have those people in the stores ready to try to sell the consoles?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I think it's a great, great concept.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Don't you want to buy a console today?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
No.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Especially if they end up dropping the price, which I know is a long shot.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
But, you know, now it's on sale. It's even cheaper than it was before. Don't you want to get one?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Have somebody there to put on a little bit of that pressure.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Do you think we'll see a Wii U Animal Crossing this year?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
A Wii U Animal Crossing this year? No, not with the 3DS. We cannibalized the 3DS one too much.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Probably next year.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Because that one is going to be coming out within weeks of E3. So, yeah, probably next year.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Like it's really going to be anything innovative.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Yeah, right. Well, you can sit down now.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Ooh! You know what? I could sit down before. I could go get a latte and sit down.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
But now you can. What were the other big things? There's benches.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
You're the mayor. You can swim.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Well, okay, so to be fair, they did kind of change the main plot of sorts.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Yeah, I'm sorry, but does it have virtual console games like it did in the GameCube version? Because that was awesome.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I actually liked my indentured servitude to Tom Nook.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And considering that we're selling virtual console games for 30 cents, why can't you put some NES games in there?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It's not like you're losing money on that.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
So Nintendo really wants to change the rules this year because they're doing the whole forget the press conference,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
we're going to do Nintendo Direct, and now we're going to be taking the show on the road to Best Buy 2.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000
They are literally taking their case directly to fans. I do think it's smart, though, in the position Nintendo's in.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
There's too much fucking smart when it comes to Nintendo on the internet, and then that kind of spills over into the media.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:48.000
So Nintendo's just like, you know what? We're going to take our case directly to the fanboys who will pitch up a storm.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Yeah.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Who needs PR when you got people to do it for free?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Exactly. Exactly. So it's going to be interesting. I'm curious to see how this works out for them because it could be a game changer.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I am not going to sit here, though, and say E3 is dead or dying because there was a time when E3 didn't have anything to do with the media and all this stuff.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:14.000
You know, before the internet, there was still E3, and granted, you would see screenshots and things of Nintendo power,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:22.000
but it was not the blowout thing that it is today. E3 started because it's the one time during the year when everybody in the industry kind of gets together under the same roof,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000
and there's a lot of wheeling and dealing that happens at E3 that the media doesn't even know about.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Like, think about it. One year I went to E3, I think it was 2006, maybe it was, it might have been 2010, I don't know.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Apple had a booth at E3, or excuse me, not a booth. Apple had a conference room at E3.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000
It was a behind closed doors thing, and a lot of people were thinking, ooh, is Apple doing a game console? Ooh, ooh, you know, and that whole thing.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
No, Apple was probably showing off the iPhone or the iPad, depending on whatever year it was.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
That's probably what they were showing in that little room to developers who were there at the same roof.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.000
That had nothing to do with the media. Apple was not rolling that out to the media yet, but Apple was probably, and again, this is a huge theory here,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:09.000
because I don't know anything, but I'm assuming that that's part of the wheeling and dealing that happens at E3 that has nothing to do with the media interaction.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:17.000
The media could not come to E3, and E3 I think would still happen. It might not be as big of a deal, but I think there would still be the necessity for the show.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000
So, anyhow, tangent. But let's move on with something that doesn't have to do with Nintendo.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It has to do with Steam, which we brought up earlier in the show. Kind of something interesting on Steam. It's called Steam Trading Cards, and it's...

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I forgot I played Portal 2 because of this.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Did you get in the beta for this?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Yes. I actually have three extra passes I can share.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Give me one, because I went into the beta and I wanted to get this. Alright, well, maybe give some away to listeners or something.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.000
But anyway, Steam Trading Cards are the new thing from Valve, and maybe you can speak on this better than I can, Logie.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Yes, Steam Trading Cards, they let you get Steam rewards when you play the game, so they're not the achievements, but achievements that will actually unlock these cards

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
that you can then use to, when you get a set together, get a new background or an increase in your friends list or something like that.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
It's like hats for non-hat games, because you can generate these, too.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Oh, can you pay for them?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I think, well, the trading. I think maybe there might be some money exchanged.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Well, they're probably just trying to add to the trading pool and that thing. But it does seem like, in a way, it's all the same games.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I mean, yet again, it's Dota and Half-Life and Portal, which you would expect. Of course, the Valve games are going to be involved.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
But they do have Don't Starve and Counter-Strike Global Offensive, so at least there's some other games participating.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
But I would like to see more third parties kind of get in on this to really give value added to this, because...

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Well, and I didn't really understand how it works either, as far as, like, see, here's the thing.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I went back to play Portal 2. I was actually just going to play Portal 2, and I noticed I don't have any of my achievements on Portal 2.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Like, they all disappeared somehow.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
What?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Yeah. It's weird.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So I started playing it again, but I haven't gotten any cards or anything, and then today I got a notification saying that I got some new items in my inventory.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000
And so now I have three items marked as Steam Trading Card Beta Access.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And it says, Steam Trade Card Beta Access Extra Copy Grants Early Access to the Steam Trading Cards Beta Game Badges and New Profile.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Join Steam Trade Carding Group and post your feedback in the discussions area.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Select Add to My Game Library to Activate, which I tried to do because I didn't see it on my library, and it won't let me do that.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Well, you need to send one of those to the username. I just private messaged you.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
So I can check that out.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I will do that.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Hooray!

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Alright. What do you think of the whole thing as a concept, though? Let's just assume it works as we read it.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
It's neat. It's more interesting than trophies. I mean, because a lot of times it's like, oh, achievement.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Yeah, just bring value to that.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I noticed ActDeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying, you can buy the trading cards through the Steam Community Market.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
And he says, I sold two extra passes. I got $1.50 for each.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
It's like selling stuff in the Diablo real money auction house.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Valve didn't probably take a dollar out of that.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Sounds interesting. I guess any excuse to go back and play Portal and Half-Life and all that, right?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Let's move on. DarkSakura.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Well, this is something that has my hubby super, super excited. In fact, he was practically bouncing in his seat over this.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Gran Turismo 6 has been announced. And it's going to be, there's a demo going to be out in July.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:54.000
The information actually hit, I think, the European Sony news networks not too long ago.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:04.000
They're saying that it's going to be on the PS3 and that they're basically going to keep it on that system.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
They don't say anything about it being out for the next gen system.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
They're going to have GT Academy in 2013 as well.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000
And that this new version is going to have 1,200 cars, 33 locations, and 71 layouts.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So that's seven more locations than Gran Turismo 5 had. And it will have the UK Silverstone circuit.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Hmm.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000
It says new physics engine, new modeling, all kinds of stuff.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And I will buy it.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Did you hear that?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
No.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Dan goes, and I will buy it.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Of course you will.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
He came in, raised his hands in the air and goes, and I will buy it.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Well, interesting though that it's not PlayStation 4. I think that's the thing that really shocked people is that,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
well, PlayStation 4 has this whole racing club, or what do they call it in that game?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
The drive club?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The drive club or whatever, but yet there's no Gran Turismo.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And this is going to be on the PlayStation 3.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Without the PlayStation 4 being backwards compatible, Gran Turismo 6 is a great reason not to upgrade.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Yeah, but also put it out this way.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
If you want to guarantee sales, why not put it out for the system that everyone already has?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Well, yeah, but that's going to be a problem when the new systems start coming to get people to buy them.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I don't think so.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I think that they're going to have maybe some special edition come out later that everyone's going to go,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
ooh, we need this instead, and meh.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Gran Turismo 6 HD or something?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Something like that.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
WhatupG in our chat says, each of the PlayStation systems have had two main Gran Turismo games,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
so I expect PlayStation 4 to have Gran Turismo 7 and 8.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
So maybe there's just a pattern that's trying to not be broken here.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
That's a good point.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And actually, they were saying that for Gran Turismo 5, 10 million copies were sold.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:02.000
And that it is, the Gran Turismo franchise itself is their most successful franchise ever, especially in Europe.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
70 million copies over the span of the series.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Alright.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Yeah.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Well, let's travel around.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I think it's a wise move to put it on PS3.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I guess, but it's very strange.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
It seems a little bit like cannibalizing PlayStation 4,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000
but I guess they feel there'll still be plenty of people wanting to pick up a PlayStation 4 for Drive Club.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So, I don't know.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000
See, I have a feeling that they're going to really push a Gran Turismo 7 for PS4

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
and make that a big selling point, like around, say, some sort of major holiday or big sales period.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Yeah, but it's just weird to me that Gran Turismo 6 and Drive Club for PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 4

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
are all around the same time, essentially. It's weird.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
They're saying that they may release another version on PlayStation 4 later on after launch.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Of course.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
See, that's pretty much what I was anticipating.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Yeah. Alright.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that'll be coming out a little bit sooner than Gran Turismo 6,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
as in games that are out this week.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And we'll start with Loki in the US.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
This week, there's actually quite a few things.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Starting off, Resident Evil Revelations HD is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.000
And then I know the game that everybody's super excited for, Fast and the Furious Showdown,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
which is being developed by the guys that did the NASCAR games.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:32.000
That's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii U, and the 3DS.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And then there's the Worms Collection, which is kind of a re-release of some of the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network games.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
That's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Also, Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes on the Wii U.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And on the 3DS, on Friday, actually, we'll be getting Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
And that's going to be coming out as well.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And last game this week, Sniper Elite V2 on the Wii U.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
So hey, there's Wii U games coming out.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Unfortunately, there are games that have come out a long time ago, like a year ago.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
So, give or take.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases that are going to happen over there.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Starting off with the PlayStation 3 this week on May 23rd, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.000
BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend, which is getting a price cut that's going into the Best Hits collection.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Kamen Rider Batteride War in regular and premium editions is out this week from Namco Bandai.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I would play that.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Or as they call it over there, Bandai Namco.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Terraria is getting a Japanese release, believe it or not, and that will be out this week.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
As well as The Sims 3 Pets, getting a price reduction on PlayStation 3.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Also on PS3 this week, Z slash X, Zillions of Enemy X, Zetsukai no Crusade.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Yes, that is Zillions of Enemy X.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
How many zillions?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Rob, you just made me sad.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Why?

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Because that just makes me actually want a zillion game.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Like on Master System only all updated and new.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:22.000
On the Xbox 360 this week, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is there as well in a regular and a limited set.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
That's pretty much all you get on the 360 this week.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Going to the Vita, BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend also gets a price cut there.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And Valhalla Knights 3 comes out this week from Marvelous Entertainment over in Japan.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Checking out the Wii U, yes there is a game.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
It's Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is out there as well.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
So all the consoles in Japan getting that.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000
On the 3DS this week there is a new 3DS XL model, or as they call it the LL.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.000
It's the Shimagami Tensei 4 Limited model because Shimagami Tensei 4 is out this week in Japan.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
That's going to be a pretty big release.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I'm sure there's some people going to be importing that one.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
You can actually get that retail or download.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
There's a whole accessory set.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
You can get a skin for your 3D.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
If you're a Shimagami Tensei fan, you're probably importing tons of shit this week from Japan.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Good luck to your wallet.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:18.000
If you are not a Shimagami Tensei fan, perhaps Tamagotchi no Doki Doki Dream Omisechi would be of interest to you.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Yes, it's another Tamagotchi game on the 3DS.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I think you should just get Shimagami Tensei 4 if you're going to import one or the other.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Just saying.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Lastly on the PSP, yes they are still making games for the PSP in Japan.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Zeroji no Kane 2 Cinderella Halloween Wedding in regular and deluxe editions.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And Rakuen Danshi coming out this week.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
What is Cinderella Wedding?

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
That is not, I don't think the Disney Cinderella.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
This looks like one of those games based off an anime.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Oh god, it looks like one of those romance games.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Because I see girl and guy in the bar, girl hanging off guy, guy kissing girl and all this stuff.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
So it must be one of those series.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Alright, that's it for Japan. Let's travel over to the UK.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
On the 22nd we have the incredible adventures of Van Helsing.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Midna stop eating that!

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Sorry, Midna was eating my headphone cable.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:23.000
On the 24th we have Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Dust an Elysian Tail, Fast and the Furious Showdown, Big Whoop, Resident Evil Revelations, and Sniper Elite V2.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:40.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase TEST.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Alright, there it is UK. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Loki.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Alright, so Nintendo has kind of taken an action against these Let's Play videos on YouTube.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:05.000
What's going to happen is, partnering I guess with YouTube, they're going to be using their content ID match system

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:18.000
to basically take the ad revenue that these Let's Play videos are getting if they're monetized.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
And that's all going to be going to Nintendo.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And then also they're going to be having ads I guess before and after the videos as well.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I guess it's going to somehow automatically get added in for Nintendo stuff.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
So that kind of sucks, I guess.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I know YouTube has policies against the Let's Play stuff, although there's still a ton of it on there.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And it's kind of confusing because some companies will let you do Let's Plays on their stuff, like Minecraft for example.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000
There's a big thing saying, hey, film whatever you want, do whatever you want.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
It's cool.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And I know they're not taking the videos down, but the fact that they're kind of like, hey, we're taking all the profits from it.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
That's kind of like, I almost wish they would just take them down instead.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
It's kind of a little weird.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Well, here's the thing.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
The thing I was most surprised to learn from this whole story is that there's people that make livings off of doing Let's Play videos.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I had no idea you could make that kind of money on YouTube.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And I'm like, wow, I'm in the wrong business.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Apparently I need to do some sassy Let's Play videos or something.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Yes, I was joking with Rob saying that, hey, because I do monetize some of the videos I make for YouTube.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Just for shits and giggles because I know I'm not going to get millions of hits on it.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
But hey, let's see what kind of ad money will rake in from this.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:54.000
With the few videos that I have, and a few of them have like a thousand views or something, a whopping 26 cents.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Nice.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Yeah. I'm retiring.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Do you think Nintendo is evil for what they did?

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I don't think it's a good idea.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I mean, I understand that they're saying, oh, you guys shouldn't be making money off of our content.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000
But it's less about making money off their content and more of just like, you know, it's commentary and stuff.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:22.000
You can't really do a Let's Play video or like a commentary on gameplay without showing the gameplay.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Unless you have some sort of weird like riff tracks thing that you do.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I've seen a lot of anger directed at Nintendo on the Internet this week over this whole thing.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
And it's like, OK, to some extent, I do get it.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And I feel I can understand where the YouTube community feels a little bit slighted on this.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And I can certainly understand, hey, this is the Internet and we can just pick up and move it to somewhere else.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
You know, I'm sure there's a lot of that talk going on right now.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000
But you guys, Microsoft did this in October of last year.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000
In fact, I believe it was October 9th was the date the news went out is that Microsoft now they did something a little different.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:03.000
But they actually put it in their whole little terms of service that you cannot earn money from these games like Halo four and so forth.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And that if you cannot enroll in a YouTube partner program, if you are playing one of these Microsoft games.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Here's how that's how I think a lot of gamers forgot about that in their anger, because everybody's like, oh, Nintendo's just doing this because the Wii U sucks and all this stuff.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And I'm like, well, Microsoft did the same fucking thing seven months ago. Does that mean the 360 sucks?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:27.000
But they do this. They're doing this now. And then, of course, we don't know it's confirmed yet.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000
But the rumor is they're going to be kind of rolling out the same features that the PlayStation 4 has where you can share videos and content gameplay and stuff.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000
If if they have it where you can live stream and do commentary over that stuff.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:48.000
So you're not going to be able to monetize those videos that you put out there, even though you're I mean, they're making it super easy for you to do that.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
They just want you that freely advertise their game without any sort of, you know, that's the thing.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:02.000
It's like you're kind of advertising their game. It's not like you I mean, you could technically you could spoil, I guess, stuff from the game, but it's not the same as playing a game.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
It's not like if it was a movie, like you're watching a movie or something like that.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It's gameplay. There's actual, you know, interaction that's involved in each one of those, you know, experiences could be unique depending on the game, I guess.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000
But I wouldn't say once again, those interactions were designed by Nintendo.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I got that's the place I saw that argument. You want the word to get out of every game.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
You want your game to look fun. You wanted to gather the people, whether they're seeing it like on.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
If I come over and watch someone playing a game, how's that any different than watching it over the Internet?

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I'm not saying I necessarily disagree completely that Nintendo made a bad decision with this.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:45.000
But I also think there's a lot of gamer entitlement going on here that you guys if it was a movie.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Do you think I could put up a copy of Star Trek into darkness with my commentary on YouTube and not have that get struck down with probably something a lot worse than the monitor?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
It would be a copyright strike.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:03.000
You know, I think if I were to put something up, you know who's really fucking crazy about their intellectual property is sports.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
The NBA and the NFL, especially the NFL.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:13.000
If I were to put up like classic football clips and be talking over them and stuff, they would come after me legally.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
It would be a lot worse than what Nintendo is doing here.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
And I kind of think there's gamer entitlement going on here.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:26.000
And this is just a rude awakening. And I'm sorry, but I think gamers are getting it a lot better than some of these other.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Well, Rob, also keep in mind, like for another example, this is the RiffTrax guys have to get licensing.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Which and they don't even don't they just do their sales that they don't attach?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Well, they don't have to get licensing.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:50.000
They only have to get licensing for when they're actually doing like a show, like an actual movie in a theater with the stuff they do is in the public domain now.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Yeah. But anything else?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Yeah. Anything else that they do like a RiffTrax for like a Transformers movie or something like that?

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
They don't have to get permission from Paramount to do that.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
They're just it's an audio track that they make.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
It doesn't have anything. They're not releasing it with the video on there.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:18.000
But that's the same thing, though, is you people know the whole reason that you're having this share thing on the PlayStation 4 and stuff is to kind of you want to share those moments with, you know, your friends and stuff like that.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:26.000
But if you're going to like start, you know, say, OK, we want you to get that footage out there, get that footage out there and then start hammering them down.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Oh, I'm sorry, but that's not that footage was too long.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I'm sorry, but you you're trying to make some money off of this.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:41.000
They're not going to be motivated to continue doing those let's play videos if they make no money off of it, because that's they're doing that.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
They're trying to put out content. And if you're saying, well, you can't make any money off this.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I mean, that's basically I mean, that's I know it's a little stretch, but it's almost like saying, you know, we're telling you what you can do, what you can and can't do with this game.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Like, oh, sorry, you can't sell used. We're telling you what you can and can't do.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:05.000
In part, that's where I do agree with you, is that this wasn't a smart PR move on Nintendo's part on a time where they need a lot of good news.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And I think what should happen here, and this is probably a limitation of YouTube, quite honestly, is that maybe there needs to be something where it's a split revenue stream or something like that.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000
But Loki, if people are making money, they're making a living off of let's play videos.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
That tells me what forty thousand dollars a year minimum right to to live off of.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
You got maybe in some parts of the country, thirty thousand or less. I don't know.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000
But you're talking multiply that by how many people on on YouTube are doing it for a living.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Fifty one hundred. But that's that's a it's a big chunk of views.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
A lot of views required. It's like thousands of views to get like a penny.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I mean, seriously, I know. In fact, I'm going to look it up right now because I can look at my monetization, see what exactly, you know, I'm bringing in, I guess.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:02.000
But again, you know, and I'm not dissing the talent of these individuals and their funny, witty stuff and so forth, because that would be kind of biting the hand that, you know, makes up this show here.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:11.000
But then again, we're not displaying images of the game in motion the whole time during that during the show or whatever. I don't know. I don't know.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Yeah, but it's stupid, though, that they were also not trying to make a living off.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Well, here's the problem, too, is they basically say, OK, yeah, we're going to have this partnership program that we're going to partner with, you know, IGN or something like that or, you know, you know, Machinima or something like that.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000
And then you have to you have to become an affiliate with them, you know, but they may not let you become an affiliate with them.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:42.000
So once again, you're given these big guys. How's an indie supposed to shine if, you know, you're just saying, oh, sorry, you can't show any of our gameplay.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
We only want IGN to show our gameplay, find another way to monetize it.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:28:00.000
But how do you do that? I mean, there's I mean, if if I knew I would have the money, I'm saying, though, that if there's another way to monetize it, they're going to still hit you for the same thing, that you're making money off of our videos or off our content.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000
You know, what if it's like PayPal donations or something like that for a Twitch stream or something?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I'm sure people make money off of that, but I just I don't know.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I don't think that I think there's going to be a standardized way that people are going to make money off of videos, whether it be monetization via ads or whatever.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Oh, maybe they can cater those ads for those Nintendo videos to Nintendo products, something like that.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
That seems to make more sense to me.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Yeah, I do think, again, I think the smarter thing for Nintendo to do would have been to partner with these people to come to a solution that has both people in mind, either it's split revenue or it's ads that support Nintendo or or whatever it is.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
But by putting the hammer down, they made themselves look like dicks.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
But my point is they are well within their legal right to do so.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And I think people need to give give Nintendo a little bit of a break here is that when you hear about that people are making a living off of this.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I mean, Nintendo is entitled to some of that money.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
I'm rolling the money. I just made seven more cents.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I'm at thirty one cents.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Here's a good example of right here.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000
So some of the movie or some of the videos I've been uploading, like different videos and stuff like that.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.000
The one they have the most views on so far is like a how to sideload apps.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Tutorial, I guess it's only a few minutes long.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
So I have twenty one or two thousand one hundred seventy views.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Six hundred or six thousand nine hundred seventy seven minutes.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Twenty four cents is what it made off of that.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Wow. So just to give you an idea of how much how many views you have to get millions, millions and millions of views combined over your you know, your channel.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
So it's going to take a lot of work.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Just nobody, you know, putting out a let's play video is not going to make a ton of money.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
And they really want that ad money.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I mean, really, you want that like maybe a buck that they're going to make if they get thousands of views.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I mean, seriously, it seems a little greedy.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
All right. Going to a couple more chat comments here and then we got to move on with the show.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:14.000
But as the show says, the problem is that a lot of people on the Internet feel that they are entitled or have the right to use and access any sort of media freely.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And without having to pay for it, trying to convince people otherwise leads to hate and venom being spewed in many ways.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:27.000
These people's opinions are so unwavering that no matter what facts you tell them, people will still feel that sense of entitlement.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Shadow Next Gen says the people who make these videos might take a few hours to make them.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:38.000
They don't have the right to make money off of the new Zelda title that Nintendo took years and millions of dollars to make.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Yeah, but look at what kind of money is Nintendo making off their title versus if the amount of effort Nintendo is putting into their title versus the return versus the person that spent like an hour to make a video and his return.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I think it's fair because you look at the amount of money that they're making.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000
It's not like the guy that's making the Let's Play videos making more money than Nintendo on these titles.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I mean, I just don't see where Nintendo is necessarily losing money on this.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Are they suggesting that people are watching these Let's Plays and going, yep, that's enough of that game, I don't need to buy it now.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I'm sorry, that's just like saying, oh hey, someone pirated our game, we lost a sale.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.000
You can't attribute that. There's no data to correlate lost sales.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Make all the excuses you want, but the fact of the matter is, your system's not selling well because you don't have any games on it.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:35.000
MM2K says, YouTube just needs to establish a standard fee against revenue of anyone using copyrighted material, maybe 5-10%.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Again though, I'm with you on that for games, but like movies, I can't post a copy of Star Trek Into Darkness on YouTube and expect that, oh Paramount gets 5-10% because I'm giving my sassy commentary over this movie that just came out.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
You know? There's got to be something there.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Here's what needs to happen, and this I think would be fine.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Nintendo needs to be one of those companies like Mojang with Minecraft saying, hey, you know what?

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:14.000
We're cool with you putting the videos out there and doing whatever, but if you monetize our videos, then maybe that they have Nintendo ads on them or something like that.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Obviously that's not something that they can control, but hey, if they can go out and seek with this content ID service and somehow monetize or get those videos to have the ad revenue go back to Nintendo, then I'm sure that they have a way to target ads to Nintendo products.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000
And I think that would be fair enough because they're getting their products out there and they're advertised.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:43.000
The people are more inclined to put out these videos to spread the word about these Nintendo games.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:53.000
For example, I haven't played New Super Mario Bros. U and I watch some Let's Play videos and I'm like, hey, that looks like a pretty fun game. Maybe I should go buy it.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:02.000
If you're going to try to get these people not to put these videos out there, I'm never going to hear about this game.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:14.000
My final thought on this whole thing is that, you know, again, although Nintendo maybe didn't have the best timing with this sort of move, this is not something that's going to be limited to Nintendo and it is not limited to Nintendo.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Again, Microsoft did it. Sega did it with the whole Shining Force or something. They were taking this one random game. They were taking down all these videos.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:34.000
You know, this is still a new media that a lot of companies are exploring and I'm sorry, but if you are just using this to further your Nintendo hate boner, you need to spread the hate around equally.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Your position needs to be the same for all these companies that are doing it. So that's kind of one of my big things with this.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
If you're going to be mad, be mad at everybody.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Alright, let's move on and do one more story here before the classic game of the week. And hooray! It's a porn story! Yay!

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Kids like porn.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Yay! Here it is. Hardcore pornography apparently coming to the next Xbox. At least that's what the headlines all say.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Here's what it's really about. Sugar DVD. They do films like Hairy Asian Schoolgirl's Masturbate. That's a thing.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I think that's just a made up title.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
If it exists, it's on the internet somewhere.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:30.000
They're going to bring their streaming services to the next Xbox. It's already on Playstation 3. You can get it for $7.95 a month.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Now I believe this is not something where you exactly download an app and that whole thing. It's just you access it through the web browser.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000
It's just a website that's optimized for the system.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:51.000
They had the same story come out when the Xbox 360 got Internet Explorer. They're like, we're the first people to have porn on the Xbox.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:58.000
No, I'm sorry. It had a DVD drive. You were not the first to have porn on the Xbox. That was a streamed video.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Is there really a porn called Don't Tell My Wife I Ass-Fucked the Babysitter? That's a pretty great parody.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I think that's Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead. There's a little parody on that.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
That sounds hilarious.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I think that's actually a real porn album.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
There you go. Well, you'll find out on the new Xbox very soon.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Here's the quote from Sugar DVD's Rebecca Bolen.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000
The quote, any console would benefit from having unlimited HD adult content at the click of a button.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Dark Soccer, did you hear that? All you got to do is click your mouse.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Yay!

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Yes.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
By the way, Rob, that does exist. I looked it up.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
It is. Yes. I was going to say, they have a lot of them.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
My search history is hilarious.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
What was that one New Year's Eve, it was got to be 2006 or 2007,

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
where we were looking up the pornography on the Nintendo Wii web browser,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:01.000
and we found the pterodactyl porn, which was a guy in a pterodactyl suit having sex with some girl,

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000
and it was hilarious. Just the little motions the guy would make.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.000
And then we were trying to look up, for some reason we were looking up Donkey Punch,

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
and there was a guy dressed up like a donkey.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
That would actually punch, yeah. Hilarious.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
When in doubt, more porn stories.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Alright, let's travel to a time when, you know, a porn game, porn on the console,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
was Custer's Revenge and Bubble Bath Babes, and Miss Nude World 96.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
That was porn in gaming.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000
It's the classic game of the week, where Dark Soccer is going to walk into her classic gaming vault,

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
and she can do that tonight. She's literally right there.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I am.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Find a game that she says, hey, you kids should be playing this game, dammit.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Now I don't think she picked a porno game, so don't get too excited,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
but Dark Soccer picked something just as good as a porno.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
What's the classic game of the week?

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Today's classic game is Hagane, The Final Conflict,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
which is not a game that came out widespread in America.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
It was one of those blockbuster only games, like Final Fight Guy.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And so this is a game I do not own.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I would love to own it, however, it is $700 on eBay right now.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Holy moly.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Yeah, I'm not even joking.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Let me get to some of the audio from the game here.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Okay. It came out in 1994, and it's a side-scrolling action game.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.000
It was developed by Keita Amemiya and Red Entertainment.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
I almost said Redertainment, you know, one of our listeners.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.000
But it was Red Entertainment. It was published by Hudson Soft for the Super Nintendo.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.000
And like I said, in the U.S., it was only one of those blockbuster video games.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Now, I do have the other blockbuster game, Final Fight Guy.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
That one goes for $300.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Just saying.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
So anyway, the story behind this is that the Huma and Koma ninja clans

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.000
are basically a big rivalry against each other for the Holy Grail.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And the Huma clan is based off of the Chinese zodiac.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
And you play this one guy who is in full armor.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
And Dan and I, when Dan was playing, because we have a version of it.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Quote, version.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Ambulator.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Huh?

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Ambulator.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Yeah.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Dan was talking about some of the resemblance to Strider.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I was going to say, you love this game because it's freaking Strider.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
It's a Strider ripoff.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I didn't know Dan likes anything Strider or Strider related.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
It's Strider meets Shinobi, is what I'm looking at here.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Yeah.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
And this is actually a game I would...

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.000
I don't even care if it's just the Super Famicom version, which is still like $50 on eBay here.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I would love to have this game.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
But the big problem about it is that it's freaking hard.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Super hard and no save.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
That's why emulators are awesome.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Save states.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:09.000
But basically you're playing as a ninja cyborg who is going to kill all of the Koma Clan.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Rawr.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:18.000
And basically it's just a really, really cool side-scrolling game.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Very difficult.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:27.000
But one thing that it did get some less than stellar reviews on was actually its graphics.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
It was said not to show off the best of Super Nintendo at the time.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
So, I don't think Hagane is on Virtual Console.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
It was sorta...

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:48.000
It wasn't really, I mean, considering it was only released to video stores or whatever, it wasn't really...

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I mean, we haven't seen Final Fight Guy.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Yeah.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
So...

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Yeah, this was a very limited release.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000
You could only rent this game at Blockbuster.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
And then, like I said...

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Eric RPG in our chatroom says that they had it at his video store.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
So it may not have just been Blockbuster, but maybe like video stores in general.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Well, no, these were actually released only for Blockbuster.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
If they showed up at other video stores, then they were purchased from Blockbuster.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Oh, weird. Okay.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Yeah.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:23.000
So, because Blockbuster had like a limited release deal just on certain Japanese-only games.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
So, this was one of them.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And honestly, I would love to have this game in my collection.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
It's really, really difficult.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
But a very rich, good side-scrolling game.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.000
And don't say fucking Blockbuster, because Blockbuster is dead, pretty much.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
The one around the corner from my house is gone. They are vanishing.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I saw one in a strip mall the other day, and I was like, oh my god, it's a museum.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Yeah.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
I think that's where I picked up a copy of Parappa 2.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Okay, so I'm checking on eBay right now. There's one for $295.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:09.000
One for a buy it now of $700, and another one without the box for $400.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Dang.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Japanese copies, $45.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.000
So, I don't even care. You know me, I have all kinds of imports anyway, so.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:27.000
But I'm putting up the $700 one in chat just so people can see the cover and everything.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
All right. Well, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Hagane for the Super Nintendo. Good luck finding it.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Yeah, and if you find it, give it to me.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
As a tip.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Yeah, because you love me.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
All right, that's going to do it for part A of Orange On Radio, but don't go anywhere.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.000
We have plenty more to come, including the FUGL Question of the Week,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
all about this controversial Nintendo Let's Play topic.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000
More stories about EA and Nintendo.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000
We're going to talk a little bit about the stuff from the Google press thing this week that has to do with Nintendo.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000
A couple E3 stories for you guys, and plenty more, including your phone calls and emails,

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Watch out, Dark Soccer. Shots fired.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
What?

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Live.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 505 in progress.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Thanks to Redertainment for starting shit here on the second half of our show.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Appreciate that. If you want to leave a bumper for our show.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000
More information available on our forum at the VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000
We're finally getting a few of them in. I have another new one to play next week, so thanks to you guys.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
If you want to use your voice to tell our listeners something,

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
and possibly start a fight with Jamie in the process, go ahead and do so.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
So there you go.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000
You know what?

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
What?

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Haderson was. There was another game that I played this week that I totally forgot.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Let's see. Before we get into rapid fire news, there was a couple other things I wanted to bring up.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
One of them was there was another game that I played this week that I totally forgot to talk about,

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.000
and that is Just Dance 4, believe it or not, on Xbox 360, because I think it's on several platforms.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000
But Target was having a sale this week on all the Just Dance games for Kinect.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Twenty bucks.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
So I picked up Just Dance 4 for twenty bucks.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I got to say, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
You know I love music games, right?

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:44.000
And I've been very partial to the Dance Central series, and last time I remember playing a Just Dance game.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Excuse me, a Just Dance game. I wasn't really into it.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:53.000
But I got to say, I really like, especially in Just Dance 4, well A, the song list is very like, what the fuck?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Like there's some really, like, you know, they have the stuff you'd expect to hear, like some top 40 hits.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Like J-Lo on the floor, and Pink, So What.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000
But then like there's these picks. They have a cover of the Time Warp.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
What?

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Yeah, which is hilarious.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
They have Army of Lovers with Crucified. I don't know if you guys remember that song.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
You love that song.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Remember that song?

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Seriously, Google that music video. It is hilarious.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
That song is in the game.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Does it have a video?

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
No, it doesn't have the original video. None of them have the original videos.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000
But the Army of Lovers videos, all their videos were hilarious.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
But does it at least have like a hilarious, because you know how they kind of dress up the actors?

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
They are dressed, like the little actors are all dressed up. They are dressed up for that.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.000
I actually haven't played that song because it's a higher difficulty, and I've been warming up a little more into Just Dance.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:50.000
But I really like that they have these full workout modes where it'll actually do like a, kind of like a warm up little like, you know, generic electro beat or whatever you pick.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
And then you'll do a bunch of songs and you do like a cool down.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000
So actually the way it, it's not just a bunch of songs on shuffle counting the calories.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
That's pretty cool.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Yeah, that I really liked. So for 20 bucks, I was very happy with that.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000
So yeah, that was a game I forgot to mention earlier. So there you go.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I guess we can get into some rapid fire news now if you want.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Sure. So the, uh, the folks behind the incredible machine, which I sunk a lot of hours into, um, back for one of my first computer games.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Um, they're making, I love that game by the way. Fantastic.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:36.000
That's like, uh, what do they call those? The Rube Goldberg machines or whatever, which reminds me, or as everybody knows it, the opening sequence to Pee Wee's Big Adventure with a Mr. T cereal.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000
The little machine that makes them breakfast.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
I pity the fools that don't eat my cereal.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Remember that?

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Oh no, Mr. Eggman.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:49.000
All right. Uh, so now they have a new game called Contraption Maker and that's going to be coming out later this year.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Um, apparently they said it's also going to be mod friendly and, uh, you know, have some way to allow players to build more elaborate puzzles, um, and machines that can air connect with each other and you can be able to share them over the internet.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Um, that's awesome. So yeah, they'll be coming out.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Um, probably have to pick that up because I love the incredible machine and, uh, this is also cool.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Another Kickstarter, a game called Auto Duel and it's a multiplayer car combat game.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:28.000
So probably, uh, it's a good thing that, uh, David Jeff has signed on, um, to help make this game.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:35.000
And on top of that, Zach Norman, the creator of Interstate 76 and Vigilante 8.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Well, at least I think he created Vigilante 8, but Vigilante 8, one of my most favorite car combat games.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Um, that's a pretty good pedigree right there.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
So, uh, looking forward to that and how to maybe back that when that comes out.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Um, yeah, I don't know if they've actually, uh, released or have this out yet as a Kickstarter.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Probably soon though.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Um, and last but not least, the Assassin's Creed movie has a date, or at least a time frame.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:10.000
May 2015. I also saw, was it July 2016, the beginning of the Angry Birds movie.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.000
By then, I don't think Angry Birds will be a thing anymore, or at least anyone will care.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I mean, seriously, we can all hope.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
A long time.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Alright, before I get to my, uh, rapid fire stories here, I have to, DarkSakura, I see you chatting like crazy in our chat room tonight.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Did I read that right? You said, had I not romanced Garrus in all 17 times, you've beaten Mass Effect.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
I think it's more than 17. I just made up a number.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
You might have a problem.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
No, I don't. Cause I've...

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
17? That's a lot.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Cause I do different stuff every time, except I always, uh, yeah.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Because, I'm sorry, all the other romances irritate the shit out of me.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
No, no, no. I'm not even talking about the Garrus thing.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
You've beaten the game 17 times. That's a lot of times to beat a game.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I don't think, but then again, I've seen the Rocky Horror Picture Show probably 400 times.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
But I openly admit I have a problem there.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Keep in mind, I do a lot of character customization, like I played with the gift editor.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:19.000
So I've probably actually beaten the game a bunch more times than I've done full playthroughs.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Justify, justify.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
You know what? Shut up, Rob. Don't judge me, Mr. Abba Collection.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
You have Bobby Blackwell from the chat room calling for an intervention.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
It's like I'm walking on sunshine.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.000
You know what? I'm gonna go play some Japanese Sonic Adventure.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Sonic CD. Just to spite Bobby.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I'll livestream that shit.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
You have fun with that while I read the news about yet another Kickstarter.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
This is the world we live in, guys, but this is a really cool band.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
I know a lot of you like these guys.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Anna Manigucci, the Chiptune artist.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.000
They have a Kickstarter of their own up for Endless Fantasy.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And they're very proud of the fact that they've completed this 22-track album over three years

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.000
without any help from a label, to which I say you guys go. That's awesome.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000
And the goal for this, getting the CD out there, $50,000, yeah.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000
They're sitting just under $200,000 right now, so safe to say they've met it.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Now with 13 days still to go.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.000
So if you pay, I believe, $15,000 or more, you get the CD pre-order of Endless Fantasy

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
and you get the digital download with that.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And I know we have some of their tracks and rotation on VoG and great Chiptune artists.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
So congrats, guys.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
I don't know if this game would make $200,000, but it's sure worth a shot.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Shaq Fighter is apparently a name that has been trademarked.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Oh yes, I'm sure you all remember Shaq-Fu, which is what, on Super Nintendo and Genesis, I think, as well?

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Yes, it was the fighting game that starred Shaq.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And it's kind of a cult game, but it's one of those games that everybody's like,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000
oh yeah, I remember Shaq-Fu, and then you actually play it, and you're like, oh yeah, I remember Shaq-Fu.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Well, there was also Shaq Down, which was a mobile game. They came out with that.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Well now, apparently, the folks that run the Shaq.com website, which I didn't even know existed until now,

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
they registered a trademark for Shaq Fighter on May 8th.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000
So I don't know if this is yet another mobile game.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Maybe this is the Wii U's killer app that's gonna get everybody to buy the console.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Or maybe it's another mobile game.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Or maybe it's another, like, attempt at a 50-cent Blood in the Sand.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Shaq goes after terrorists?

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Perhaps, perhaps. I don't know. But hey, Shaq's pretty awesome, so this is gonna be, it's gonna be worth checking out,

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
if nothing else, but for the lolz.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Wave Forward, who did the game's Adventure Time, hey Ice King, why'd you steal our garbage?

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.000
And, of course, DuckTaled Remastered, which had everybody screaming like a little girl at PAX East,

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.000
is going to be doing another Adventure Time game.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.000
It's called Adventure Time Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I love Adventure Time.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Which is pretty much, you know, any video game ever, right?

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Explore the Dungeon. Why? Because I don't know.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000
You will be exploring the secret royal dungeon underneath the Candy Kingdom.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
And, of course, you can play as Finn, Jake, Marceline, and more.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:23.000
There will be co-op as well. It's gonna be out Wii U, 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and 3DS.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000
I'm actually kind of excited about it because the last game was only 3DS, so it would be, oh, 3DS and DS.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Also happening, regular show, Mordecai and Rigby in 8-Bit Land on the 3DS.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
It's Mordecai.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Mordecai, excuse me, I don't know this show, should I? Is it really funny?

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
It's supposed to be really funny.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
I know Adventure Time, I know that one.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
If you like Adventure Time, you'd like this show.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Is it one of those things that's, like, funnier if you've, you know, smoked a certain substance beforehand?

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I think it's just the same type of humor as Adventure Time.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Okay, then yes.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Okay, so, um, don't do drugs, kids.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000
So, anyway, of course I meant smoking a hookah, which is perfectly legal.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Smoking meat.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Yes! Or water.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Let's see.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Smoking water.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Like a water bong, that's what I meant.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Anyhow, so as that name would talk about, the heroes will be transported inside your favorite games.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000
That's pretty much what you'd expect in an episode of regular show, anyway.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
So, it's 8-Bit Land for the 3DS.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I guess they already have a game on iOS, which, you know, most things do, but...

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I kind of assume that everything has a game on iOS.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000
There you go.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000
ActDef says, I like the show, lots and lots of 80s references.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Queen Simi on our chatroom says, regular show is more of a stoner, hipster show.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Just like I thought, huh? Huh?

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
There you go.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
You know what I miss?

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000
What?

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Now that, you know, we're talking about shows with a lot of references and stuff.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I miss Code Monkeys, man. That was a good show on G4.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Like, one of the...

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000
One of the few.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
One of the few.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Yes.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Stuff.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
You have to guess what it is. I'm just kidding.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Disney has registered some domains that means that they might be doing some type of racing game.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:18.000
There's Disney Speedster, Disney Speedsters, Disney Racers, Disney Racing, Disney Kart, Disney Kart Racing, and Disney Karting.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.000
They actually have a Disney Speedsters Twitter with no tweets on it yet.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
So, not surprising. Disney has their fingers in most things.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Also, there is Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventure.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:40.000
This is basically... It makes me think a lot of Pac-Land.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Do you remember?

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:50.000
But, like, on a 3D scale, and it's basically Pac-Man wandering around in a 3D world.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
It looks neat.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
It's also based off a new TV show.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
What?

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Yep.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
What?

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Now I need to go back and watch 80s Pac-Man cartoons.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:09.000
And then, last but not least, Google did a tribute to Atari's Breakout by having...

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:17.000
If you type in Atari Breakout into the Google Images search, you will find your screen turned into a Breakout clone.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Another little Google Easter egg.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Yep. I actually... I super, super loved what Google did for Saw Bass's birthday.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Oh yeah, I saw that.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I was like... I just kept watching it over and over again, and then I had to watch It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Because that man is, like, my hero.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I'm sad he's dead.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Can you still play the Pac-Man... I remember the Pac-Man thing they did was legendary.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Can you still play that?

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I can find out.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Didn't they leave that up on the internet somewhere, where you can, like, still play that?

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Uh, yes.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Really?

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Uh, yep. In fact, I will put the link into the chat room.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
I might have to leave the show to go play more Pac-Man. Just kidding.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Although apparently they're...

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Oh, sorry.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Apparently they're turning it into the new TV show anyway, so...

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Yeah.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
But anyway, you can still play that.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
It's not here, Google.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
And I'm going to read this from Travis H.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Oh, I didn't even read the damn question, did I? I'm sorry.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Well, I said it was going to be about the Nintendo Let's Play thing, but let me read to you what I said for the communities.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Or do you think they were well within their rights to make money off their game images?

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000
And I linked to the story that, um, Loki talked about earlier in the show.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Alright, so now going back to Travis H.'s answer over on Google+,

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.000
with the majority of the gaming world hating on their new console,

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000
and a lead developer from EA coming out last week calling the system crap,

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I feel like the big N needs all the help and gamer love they can get.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I own a Wii U and a 3DS.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.000
In my opinion, Nintendo is failing miserably.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
They need to focus more on making some damn games for the Wii U

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
and stop bitching about free advertisement and promotion of their games.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.000
As for the content and spoiler aspect of the videos,

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:56.000
if you don't want to watch the game content spoiled for yourself, here is a novel idea.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Don't watch. Hashtag Wake Up Nintendo.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:05.000
And that is a very similar thing that I've read on many places on the internet this week.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Do you feel the same way about Microsoft? Just making sure. I'm assuming you do.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Reading some of the other answers here, I'm going to go to Facebook,

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:18.000
and I'm purposely being a little picky choosy from names I don't see in chat and mailbag and other places,

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000
but I do encourage everybody to go read all of the answers.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000
I'll read this one. Vince from AKVG Games.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I'm a person that loves making and watching Let's Plays.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Somebody that actually does Let's Play videos.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
I neither disagree or agree with Nintendo.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Yes, LPs can be a gain or take on sales depending on how a certain game of theirs is handled be,

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
so does reviews and articles.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Theirs is handled, be it...

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.000
This was typed via mobile, so I'm thinking AutoCorrect really fucked with that sentence there,

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
but I think it's depending on how a certain game of theirs is handled,

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.000
but so do reviews and articles.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:01.000
It's a tough topic, really, because we don't really know if Nintendo is right or wrong with making this decision.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I guess for now, if you want to make a living off Nintendo long plays,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000
you'll have to contact Nintendo and work something out with them.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.000
At least you're still able to do them and not disappear from the internet like other companies do...

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Sega.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Chiggers asked, what's a Let's Play video?

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Was that tongue in cheek? I'm not sure.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Going to Zether.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Zether says, Let's Play videos are not meant to be something to be monetized.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.000
They are meant to be playthroughs of games with insightful commentary,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000
or text in the case of screenshot Let's Plays,

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
that the person who did them put their heart and soul into.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I have followed long plays from both Something Awful, where the concept originated,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000
and from users on YouTube who aren't members of Something Awful,

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.000
people who didn't want to join YouTube for the money,

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:51.000
and they were fun to watch, as opposed to most of the YouTube partners who do game long plays for the cash,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
like PewDiePie.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Even people like ChuggaConroy who play Nintendo games are not in it for the money.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Nintendo is doing the right thing, and frankly, these people deserve what's coming to them.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
That's a pretty pointed answer.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Let's see.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Andy R. says, I don't watch Let's Plays myself, but the news did solely my opinion of Nintendo a bit.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000
At least among the couple of people I know who do their own Let's Plays,

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
they're not trying to profit off the content.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:22.000
They just want to provide entertainment and to share something they love with others.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Benjamin H. actually replied to that and said,

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Andy, those LPs can still provide entertainment and share something they love.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000
If they're not trying to profit from the Nintendo-based content,

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
are they really going to be majorly affected by Nintendo trying to profit from it?

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Underleveled Video replies and says, I do Let's Plays.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.000
I only monetize the videos that the publisher of the game has said it's okay to monetize.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Blizzard, Minecraft, etc.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
They don't care because they see it as free advertising for them.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Several indie game developers have gone on record to say if it hadn't been for people playing their game on YouTube,

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
they never would have sold as many copies as they did.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:05.000
In an ideal world, I think the ad revenue generated should be split between the game developer and the YouTuber,

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000
but perfect worlds are impossible in this money-grubbing existence.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Interesting, because I suggested the same thing earlier.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Once again, I'm just confused that the amount of money that they're generating per each video is so small that you really think that,

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:29.000
I don't know, it just seems kind of, I understand it's your property or whatever,

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:37.000
and you're mad at people making money off of it because they like your property and they want to show people stuff.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I mean, it's not like they're putting out a DVD or something with your game on it and saying,

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
oh, this is my game. It's just, I don't know.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Alright, let me finish the comment here from underleveled video because I think the end of it is very interesting.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:54.000
It really is a gray area, though, in copyright and fair use.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Nintendo owns the game, but the YouTuber owns their actions in said game as well as their commentary on top of the video.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.000
I think a court case needs to happen to make legal precedent.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
That's a scary thought.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Is it really going to come to that?

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.000
It might. Not in Nintendo's case, but maybe another company.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:23.000
It could be something like, you know, where they use that content ID system and they overreach their balance and ban an account that's made a lot of money on something.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:28.000
They've done that. Was it Angry Game Nerd or whatever got his channel taken down one time?

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Well, to be fair, again, I just want to be clear, Nintendo is not doing the strike thing against the people.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:39.000
They were very clear and they tried to make themselves look like the good guys in the comments saying,

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:46.000
hey, we didn't do what certain other entertainment companies are doing and we're just switching the monetization thing, basically.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:50.000
We're not actually doing copyright strikes that will get your channel taken down.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:56.000
But in the eyes of people who are thinking they're being the big asshole, being less of an asshole doesn't make you not an asshole.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Yeah, exactly. I mean, I understand that they're doing the thing or whatever, that they're not taking down videos.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:11.000
But at the same time, they could also be like Minecraft and Blizzard and say, hey, it's cool that you guys show videos of our games.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:17.000
So, yes, I understand that they can take down games, but the fact that they're taking all the ad revenue from it is still kind of a dick move.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Alright, I want to read one more here. I think this is a very interesting response.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:30.000
It's kind of, you know, we've heard a lot of people that are very supportive of what Nintendo's doing and this one is kind of going the other direction that supports the Let's Players a little more.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
So let me read this. It's from Jeff B.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:58.000
A quality LP is work, is a part-time job's pay, or enough for one nice dinner at a month.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Honestly, it doesn't even really matter whether Nintendo was legally or morally justified because it was bad business no matter how you slice it.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:10.000
And I imagine this problem for Nintendo will diminish quickly as they continue to copyright claim people's LP videos.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:19.000
When Nintendo started this, they had to have known it'd stop Let's Play videos of their own games getting made by a good chunk of the people putting out quality game content on YouTube.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:26.000
That's free advertising that Nintendo's own most loyal community does that gets more of their games sold.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:33.000
If Nintendo wants to nickel and dime, literally nickel and dime in some cases, some of their best community ambassadors, they can go right ahead.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:38.000
I'm sure they're legally clear to do that, but maybe they should think twice about turning on their own fans.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I welcome them to come over to Twitch and try the same advertising revenue claim.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
And honestly, I'm starting to hope Twitch caves.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:50.000
It means no partners will be streaming newer Nintendo games. More room for League of Legends streams.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Just kidding, I hate League of Legends.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Someday, Nintendo will realize that giving people access to your game in nearly any way you can, not taking it away, brings in sales.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:05.000
And by doing this on YouTube, they are indirectly taking access away because the community will stop showcasing their games.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:12.000
So, very much saying that, you know, these guys are doing you a favor, and Nintendo, you are, I'm kind of summarizing in my own words,

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Nintendo, you are going to lose a lot of support on this.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.000
I found the tangent on Twitch interesting, though.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:27.000
I'm not sure what the point, I have to be honest, I'm not sure what the point was you were trying to make with that.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Because, does that mean you want Nintendo to go over to Twitch, and you want Twitch to cave on that?

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Oh, I see, because then, no more newer Nintendo games on Twitch.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.000
But, why would you want that to happen, if you hate League of Legends?

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:50.000
I think it's just saying, you know, it would show them, even if they get rid of YouTube videos of Nintendo games.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:58.000
And how old are we going here? Are we talking about like, if I have a NES Super Mario Let's Play or something like that, they're going to monetize that?

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Because that right there, they're trying to sell virtual console games, and people don't know what the hell this game is, and they look up a Let's Play video for it,

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000
and they're like, hey, that looks kind of cool, I'm going to buy that game.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Because they don't have demos for those games, even though they really should find a way to do that.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Hello, I mean, we're 2013, you can't fucking figure out how to make a demo for a game?

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Why aren't you getting people to your website where the YouTube is posted, make money off your website?

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
There's something I'm not...

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Because it's automatic. It's automatic. Because ad revenue is automatic.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:39.000
That's just like, you know, why put ads on your website? It's the same thing.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:44.000
What if I have Nintendo content on my website, and I'm making ad revenue through those same ads?

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Literally, it's the same ads that you're getting through, it's all the Google Analytics stuff, so it's kind of a work around, I guess.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
But, I don't know.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:03.000
I honestly think that the money part of it is a smaller factor than them trying to control content.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Because, I mean, think about it, you've got basically unsolicited advertising coming up, yeah,

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000
but it may not be exactly what Nintendo wants to see out there.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Maybe that is a work around, you know, you make a private video, you have some sort of, in fact, hey, someone could even get on this bandwagon,

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:25.000
they have some sort of service where it creates a webpage for you that you go to to watch this video,

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:30.000
almost like a URL redirector or shortener or something like that,

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:36.000
and look, there's ad content on there through Google Analytics, but you're still making money, but you just don't have an advertisement on the video.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000
There you go.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:42.000
But then they're going to figure out that that's a work around, and they're going to come down on you anyways.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Because people don't like loopholes.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.000
People love loopholes, companies don't.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:55.000
There's some of the answers, again, because a lot of these were lengthy and I only have a little bit of time,

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.000
I did not want to read all of them, but I encourage you guys to go read them for yourselves.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, also Google Plus, there was another answer over there.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Search for Orange Lounge Radio on Google Plus.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I would give you all the numbers, but you'd forget.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Alright, let's do a few more news stories.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000
And boy, another kick Nintendo story, right, Logie?

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Yes, I love kicking them when they're down.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:26.000
No, seriously though, but I've been saying this for months now, that EA has no games for the Wii U.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Numerous shows have said that.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:35.000
And yes, it's only been confirmed by EA that yes, they don't have any games coming up for the Wii U.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:42.000
And I think a lot of that has to do with, they're pushing to do the Frostbite 3 engine for a lot of their games,

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
including, I think, sports games.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000
And Frostbite 3 does not work on the Wii U.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Or basically, they just don't want to make it work on the Wii U because they are developing a new Frostbite engine for mobile.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:02.000
So, in theory, they could create a Frostbite 2.5 or something like that that runs on Wii U and just have to port it over.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:06.000
It's just not worth it to them to do that because they're not making any money off of it.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:12.000
For example, FIFA 14 is not coming to the Wii U because FIFA 13 sales were not very good.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Although, that's not a really good comparison because FIFA 13 was just FIFA 12 but reskinned with a roster update.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Literally, that's what it was on the Wii U.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
So, whatever.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
But that's the case, I think, with a lot of these companies.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:30.000
They're not porting their games to the Wii U because it's just not making any sense.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:36.000
And one of these games that was a big part of E3, their presentation was Ghost Recon Online.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Still on hold, even though it was supposed to be coming out.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.000
When is it coming out? We haven't heard anything since like a year ago.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
I don't know.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Let me ask a question here.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Is EA still making games for the PlayStation Vita?

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000
FIFA is the only game that they have for the Vita.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Everything else is just PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
So there is at least something that they're making for the Vita.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
See, I find that interesting.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Because I think the Vita is in a very similar boat to the Wii U.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
It's just a lot of people kind of forgot that the Vita is also struggling.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
So that tells me there's something else at play here.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:17.000
I don't think it's necessarily like EA has it out for Nintendo or whatever.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:23.000
I've also heard the theory about maybe a botched relationship with Origin on Nintendo or whatever.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Which actually might be part of it.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:32.000
But I think it's more in general an inability on Nintendo's part to grasp online.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:38.000
And I think, for one, the online pass system couldn't be implemented on the Nintendo.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Which was a problem, I think, for EA in some regards.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Because you don't see it in Mass Effect, in the Mass Effect game.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Well, you don't see it in Mass Effect, but is it on Assassin's Creed 3?

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Because wouldn't that have Uplay on it?

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Uplay is on Wii U because it's in Zombie U.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Okay, but there's a whole little separate Uplay channel that you can download and all this stuff on the Wii U as well.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Why can't there be an Origin channel?

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Why not?

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:10.000
But what I think is, I think there's something about the online store and its inability to do what EA wants.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.000
When it comes to a lot of the DLC, when it comes to the online passes.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I mean, think about it. None of the Mass Effect 3 DLC ever came to Nintendo.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.000
None of it. Not the free stuff or the paid stuff.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Only the stuff that they were able to put on the disc.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Like the extended cut.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Did, um...

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Now that I think of it too, did any of the DLC come out for Black Ops 2 on the Wii U?

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
I'm not sure it did.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
So there's something weird there.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
And to me, that's the problem.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
And I don't think it's...

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000
I don't really buy the whole, they can't do it, or it's...

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:56.000
I think that there's not as much money to be made, not because there's a lower adoption of Wii U's or whatever.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Because if they're still making games for the Vita, then that's not the only problem.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
But the Vita, it's very easy to incorporate.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
You know, it works just like the Playstation 3 with all the DLC.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:12.000
So I think there's something, I think there's something with that is the real reason why EA is not continuing to put games out there.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Because it doesn't match their vision of being able to nickel and dime you online.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.000
And possibly whatever is coming after this online pass, maybe Wii U can't do.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Think I might be onto something? Maybe?

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Maybe.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.000
But I think it also doesn't help that they don't have that many consoles out there.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:37.000
And to do a dedicated port for the Wii U, it's just not cost effective for them.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000
They're not gonna have...

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
So why are they doing it for the Vita?

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Maybe the FIFA sold a lot more on the Vita than we know.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Maybe that was a game that is consistently selling on the Vita.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
I don't know. I don't really know what the sales numbers are on the Vita.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Because it is something that's worldwide.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.000
You know, FIFA is a really big game worldwide, so maybe that happened.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Or maybe they're just gonna take the easy way out and just take the game from last year.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.000
And once again, you know, just update the roster and just release a really half-assed game.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000
That's true, they might.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:14.000
So, I guess they could have done that with the Wii U, but I don't know.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Just release the Wii version?

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Well no, the Wii U version. Just release it again.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
But just skin it and just update the rosters.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Very interesting.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:28.000
So, was that it in your little blog? Oh yeah, there you go.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000
So, let's move on to some news out of Google this week.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Google had their whole little, what was it called, the IO conference or something like that.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.000
And they announced some changes coming to Google Maps.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:45.000
They talked about some of the hangouts and Google Plus they talked a lot about.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:51.000
One of the things they talked about on Google Plus is that there will no longer be Google Plus games after June 30th.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.000
In fact, if you actually go to Google Plus games right now, they say they are no longer going to be available after June 30th.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:03.000
If you want to be able to transfer your game progress or your little microtransactions or whatever from the game,

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
you gotta take that up with the original publisher.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:14.000
So, that is going away. Possibly to make room for this, it's a game services, it's part of Google Play,

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:21.000
a game service that's going to launch out of the Play Store that will link together mobile, social, and cloud gaming.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.000
And I seem to remember they were showing like a demo that showed one guy playing on the web,

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
one playing on a phone, and one on a tablet or something.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
They're all linked together.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:34.000
So, I'm assuming Google Plus games, I mean, let's be real, they probably were not that popular in the first place

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
because Google Plus did not catch on the way, you know, Facebook did.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.000
It's popular, it's cultish, but it's not mainstream, right?

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:45.000
So, the games aren't catching on, so now they got this instead.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:49.000
They're saying it's going to be different from Apple and what they do with Game Center

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:55.000
because there will be back-end support and this is not going to be just a stand-alone application.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Anyone making a game with Google Play has access to the developer services.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Some games will have this incorporated already, like World of Goo, Kingdom Rush, Beach Buggy Blitz, Osmose, and so forth.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:15.000
It's not mandatory. There's no certification process. Interesting.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.000
And it's cross-platform, which is wonderful.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:27.000
They showed on one of the demos, it was like a tech demo, this racing game where they had all these different tablets and phones and stuff next to each other

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:36.000
and it created a racetrack, like a slot car racing thing, but it was cross-platform, cross-device, and it all worked flawlessly.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Yeah, so my thought is that they'll probably incorporate this at some point into Google Plus where it's like play the game on the web or something like that, you know?

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:52.000
So, it's just kind of an evolution of that, which sounds a lot cooler than like Facebook games, you know?

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Anything sounds better than Facebook games.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:00.000
If I get one more fucking invite for Candy Crush Saga, I'm gonna cut somebody.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Being stabbed in the eye is better than... not really.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Slightly better than Facebook games.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I've got some stuff. How about Nintendo stuff?

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Basically, Nintendo won an appeal to keep selling the Wii in the US.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Basically, there was a whole litigation about Motiva, is that how it's pronounced?

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Saying that the Wii had infringed on two of its patents to track body position and body movement,

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:39.000
but the judges agreed that their motive was just to win damages or a settlement, not for licensing.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:44.000
So, they said no, and Nintendo won.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:51.000
So, Nintendo can keep selling the Wii, even though they should be trying to get that thing off shelves

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.000
and try to make people buy Wii U instead, right?

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000
No, I think they should just give up on the Wii U and actually put out a system.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:04.000
I think it's too early. I don't understand why everybody's like,

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Wii U's dead and it's only been nine months.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Again, 3DS, same thing.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:15.000
If we're sitting here after the holidays, still saying the same story, then we can call the Wii U dead,

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
but I'm not ready to say that yet.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:26.000
I mean, I'm not saying it's dead, but it really is highly underperforming for a Nintendo system.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:31.000
I mean, you remember how Hyper Everyone was about the Wii, and then the Wii U comes out,

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
and I'm still finding them no problem, like piles of them.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.000
The 3DS was a Nintendo system, and it was the same story.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
It sold better than the Wii U.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Did it?

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000
I think it did.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
I think it, yeah, it's selling better than the...

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Well, it's definitely selling better than the Wii U right now.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Well, okay, but...

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Time frame, I'm not sure.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
The price to get one was also half as much.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Yeah.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Less than a Wii U, for sure, so...

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Well, it was $250.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Well, and think about it this way, too, you know, having a home console is a lot more,

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
I think, of a commitment than having a handheld system.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:13.000
And with a handheld system, you have the advantage of it being just that, something you can carry around with you.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:18.000
But I think with the 3DS, too, I mean, look at it this way, they had a gimmick that was interesting.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:25.000
It was a 3D display without any 3D glasses, and that was like, whoa, that's a neat thing,

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.000
versus the Wii U with, A, it's a tablet controller.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:36.000
People are used to playing with tablet controllers, or tablets, so that's not, like, it wasn't that big of a new thing,

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000
but 3D graphics without, you know, glasses, that was like, holy crap, even if, you know, no one uses it anymore.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Well, there's phones that do the same thing, now Dan's old Galaxy did.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:49.000
I don't know, I...

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
The lenticular screen?

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:54.000
I'm just not still willing to say it's dead at this point.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:03.000
But I will say, I think one big mistake they made is that they made that touchpad was really a step back to where, you know, touch gaming is at right now.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Like the whole having to use a stylus, or I mean, I guess you don't have to for some games,

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000
but it really should have been as good of a touch, you know, as modern tablets and so forth.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Because, yeah, people do know a tablet, and they expect it to respond a lot better to touch than Nintendo's tablet does.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.000
For the record, Dan said that his phone that had the lenticular screen was the Thrill.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Hmm.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
So it was in his Galaxy.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000
It was still kind of neat, though. It gave me the same type of headache the 3DS does.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:39.000
So are we going to have them release, like, a Wii U with Tablet Plus that's going to have multi-touch on it, and it's going to be an upgrade of what it, you know, like they did with Wii Remote Plus?

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I hope not.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:48.000
I still would like to see some more games for the system I have, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's a place we end up next year.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:54.000
But I think this year is all about, like, this is not a year to release any hardware.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Maybe that whole Wii Fit thing, which I'm sure is one of the games they're going to be pushing for the holidays,

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:10.000
that is a little bit different because that's an add-on with a very specific purpose, but this is not the year to be pushing hardware for the Wii U or anything in the living room.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Like, it will really alienate the people that have supported the system.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Didn't make me happy that the Circle Pad Pro came out either, but at the same time, they didn't, like, what, four games use it?

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:28.000
So, anyway. Alright, let's move on. Loki.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Alright. So, you know, Ouya. I was joking about this on Bobby's show.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Ouya is going to be at E3. Well, at E3 in proximity to E3. They're going to be in a parking lot outside of E3. In a van.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Down by the river?

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:54.000
By the river, yeah. No, actually, they're going to be in the parking lot, and they're going to be, you know, they basically said,

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Everything you need to put on the killer game demo. Ouya console, controllers, and TV.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:12.000
That's not how you put on a killer game demo. I mean, because, granted, there are a lot of games, I mean, there's games on the Wii U or the Ouya, but not all of them are like,

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Hey, buy me, because this game is on there. I mean, no-

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Although they could show that parking game with no brake.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Parking game is awesome.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.000
No brake parking.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:31.000
What I want to know is how they're going to fix my controller, because my controller is all fucked up, and apparently the newer consoles that are shipping out have a fixed controller.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:39.000
So, where do I RMA that bitch, because I want a controller where the analogs fucking work. You know, I think that's expected.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:47.000
So what if I backed your console, you fucked up on something, and it needs to be fixed. So, that's why I'm concerned.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Anyways, yeah, if they're going to be there-

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Well, you could go down to the Staples Center and ask.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
No, I'm not driving down there for that shit.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
If I go, I'll ask.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
And they probably won't know either.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I still don't know if I've been blessed by the E3 Pope or not, so I'm still figuring that whole thing out.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:07.000
But I will try to stop by. But it should be noted that there are many parking lots around the convention center.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:15.000
This is likely the same lot that Saints Row the Third used last year, which is across the street from Staples Center, which got even more exposure,

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:20.000
because, hey, it was right during the time when the Lakers were in the playoffs last year when E3 was going on.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Or was it last year or two years ago? No, it was last year. So, even extra exposure, right?

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Yeah.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Anyhow.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Well, Konami talk in E3, or at least a pre-E3 show, and they've been doing this kind of, they've been doing like the Nintendo Direct thing for a little while, too.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
They do these videos that go out.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:49.000
So, Konami will be doing a pre-E3 show that will give the latest on some of their franchises on June 6th.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:56.000
This is the third year that they've done it. Notice how, I think the last time they did it was when Rock Revolution came out.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Or the last time they did a live presentation, rather. And that was a hot mess.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.000
So, yeah, now they do these videos that are all pre-done instead.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:14.000
So, June 6th, 1pm Eastern, which will be streaming live online through Konami's event site, also on GameSpot, also through Xbox Live and the GameSpot app.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:20.000
New trailers for Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2, which was also seen last year.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
A year before last, I think.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:28.000
But also, Metal Gear Solid 5, which I'm sure some people are very excited about. The Phantom Pain.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Snake is even older.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Yes, that will be there as well, and I'm sure there will be some other unannounced goodies, too.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:39.000
And I know we have some long-time Bomani fans who still listen to the show.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:45.000
I would not go in anticipating anything as far as the Beat games go, but you never know.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:55.000
If the new Xbox has this Kinect thing built in, maybe they'll try the Rhythm Party thing again, or Dance Masters.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:00.000
I don't think Dance Masters did very well. But Rhythm Party was just on sale over the weekend. It might still be, actually.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:06.000
If you don't have Rhythm Party and you like Bomani games, and you have a Kinect, Rhythm Party's not bad.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000
The problem is, there's only like five songs in the base game. It's all DLC.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:16.000
But it's pretty well put together. They should have just made it a disc game with a well-rounded 50 songs. It would have been awesome.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:21.000
But, anyway. So, I don't know. I wouldn't hold my breath as far as music games go, though.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:28.000
I don't think you're gonna see BeatMania 2DX or anything. I don't know. Just call it a hunch. I think a lot of that stuff is long gone.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:35.000
I don't know what the heck they would be putting out then, because they don't really have anything other than Castlevania. That's all I know.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Pro Evo, I guess, would be another Pro Evo game.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:41.000
It could be another Silent Hill entry.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Nah, I don't think so.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:43.000
It's about time for one of those, isn't it?

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
I don't think there's gonna be one of those this year.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000
You never know.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Alright. Let's go on to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:57.000
And DarkSakura dives into the email bag head first.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:02.000
And tries not to catch anything as she's pulling out your emails to read here on the show.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000
DarkSakura!

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Why don't you read some emails for us?

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Okay. We have three. Three whole emails.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:18.000
The first one, Dear OLR, A very belated congratulations on your achievement of reaching 500 plus episodes.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Excuse me.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Thanks for being there with me on so many long drives to work and back.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.000
I wish that I could join you on live shows more often, but family commitments usually conflict with that.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:35.000
I have been listening to you since before my son was even born six years ago, who is now old enough to game with me.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Thank you for making me feel old.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Right?

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Seriously.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:47.000
With the new next box being announced this week, I continue to be very excited about gaming even though I miss the days of the arcade.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Or days gone by of trying to finish games we rented from the local video store.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Sometimes I feel that gamers today are very jaded considering there is a gamut of options out there on every imaginable platform.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000
The constant complaints can often be disheartening.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000
I agree with that.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:11.000
I was like, man, we had games that we could only get from Blockbuster that were really hard and had no save function and we liked it.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Seriously.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Anywho, this topic is about appreciation and I wanted to show mine to you with a small token.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Keep up the great work, Dark Charger.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Well, I'll go ahead and read it because it's kind of long.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
It's up to you if you want to read the rest of this on the internet.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:37.000
I'm hoping Dark Soccer since she's unemployed or someone OLR can use this license either for the show or even just to enjoy.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
You're welcome to keep it or give it away as you please.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Oh my god.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
A one year subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Yeah, I saw that in the email bag earlier this week and I was like, oh boy, Dark Soccer is going to be pretty excited about that.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.000
I just, I need new underwear, please.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:58.000
If she doesn't want it, then I would like to get the new audition.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
That would be great for podcasts.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Yeah, but a very, very generous donation and I'm always amazed by the generosity of our listeners.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Just in being here and participating and even when there's free stuff like this to come out of it and a lot of that stuff will go right back into helping the show and vlog.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Well, given that I'm doing all of the graphics for the site and everything, yeah, I think I have a use for this.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.000
So, yeah, very cool.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Excuse me, I'm actually tearing up a little bit now.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Are you really?

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Just a little bit.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Can you cry on air?

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.000
No, I won't cry on air.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:42.000
I cried on air when we got a gift once. Why can't you cry on air?

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
You've cried on air.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.000
I have cried on air, probably more than once, but anyhow.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I usually just cry from wank, but this is actually like, oh my god, it's super, super awesome.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:59.000
So, again, thank you. It's amazing. You really didn't have to. And I know that shit ain't cheap.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Like, you might have had an in or whatever, but I really hope you did not have to pay a lot of money for that. That's something else.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Isn't the current CS Suite something like a good $700?

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Well, I know that when I tried to get the student edition for CS6, it was like $300, and I'm still using 5.1.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:26.000
So, I'm feeling verklempt.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Are you okay to go to the next one?

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Talk amongst yourselves. I'll give you a topic. No, I'm ready to go on.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
All right.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000
I'm just a little floored right now, and probably Sinus Medicine has something to do with that, too.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Okay.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Dear OLR, after a two-week vacation, I came back to find my Wii U game pad was left on in TV remote controller mode the entire time plus a day, or 360 hours straight.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:58.000
It responded when I turned it off, and I later started the Wii U to see if I had burn-in on the pad. Nope.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:05.000
It was plugged in the whole time, or it would have turned itself off. That's a good argument for unplugging it while playing, and that's from Rababa.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Interesting. That's a long time to leave that thing on.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:15.000
I thought that thing was only supposed to work for like three hours, but I guess maybe because the remote doesn't really use the transmitter functions.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:16.000
That's crazy.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Well, he said it was plugged in.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Oh, it's plugged in. Oh, okay.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Yeah, but on top of that, though, not having any burn-in is... I'm sorry, I'm still a little floored by the other thing.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000
That's all right.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Not having burn-in is actually pretty amazing.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:42.000
I remember, of course, this was 19 years ago, earlier than that, having Samurai Shodown 3 and the big screen having burn-in after a week.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:48.000
I remember the Apple IIe monitors were really susceptible to burn-in. You had to be careful.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Oh, yeah, you had that little icon in the corner forever that was your computer icon.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Yeah, it lived there. It never went away.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:05.000
But that's pretty impressive. That's actually a really good sign of a quality product. Okay, I won't rag on the Wii U that much anymore.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Yeah, I will.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Yeah, you will. Don't lie.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Yeah, you know me. I'm a hater.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Liars don't get codes for software.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Okay, so we have one more email, and this person does not give us a name, so I'm just going to say Kirk, which is the first name attached to this.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Good evening, my OLR peeps. My name is Kirk, and I wanted to email you guys and say that for about six to eight months, I was taking a break from console gaming and listening to gaming podcasts.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Your show is one of my gaming podcasts I would listen to on a regular basis, and even though I couldn't make it to the livestreams, I've been a loyal listener for many years. Oh, we love you.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:56.000
But this past year, I decided to be a real adult, which leads me to buying my first home, going back to school to finish my degree, and finally working on those New Year resolutions of losing weight.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:59.000
I currently have lost 121 pounds. That's like losing a supermodel.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:00.000
That's crazy.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Yeah.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:10.000
I just want to say, though, with all due respect, I think that's great that you have those priorities, but I don't own a home, I don't have a degree from college, and I'm fat.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
You are not fat, Rob.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:20.000
I still feel like an adult, so I'm just saying, you don't have to have those things. I understand the point the listener was trying to make.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:25.000
You are not fat, Rob. Just saying.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Okay. With being occupied with all those things along with a full-time job, gaming fell by the wayside, and I've given up my PS3, Xbox 360, 3DS, and listening to gaming podcasts.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Things have settled down recently this year with me adjusting to my new townhouse, except for the noisy neighbors, and keeping a regular routine with school and gym time.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
I've gotten back into gaming.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:56.000
For the first time in my life, I built my own gaming PC piece by piece, and I am now back exclusively as a PC gamer addicted to Steam sales and getting used to WASD.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Yeah, Steam sales. Superdicting.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:06.000
With my glorious return to gaming, I'm also happily back to listening to my favorite podcasts, which yours is first on the list.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Aw.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:19.000
On My Favorite Hobbies was listening to you while listening to podcasts in the background, and I wanted to say thank you for entertaining me for so many years, and I'm glad to be back as a loyal listener.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Well, we are glad to have you back.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Aw, this fat homeless dropout is so happy to have you here.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
I had to, sorry.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
You know what?

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:41.000
I get the real point. Sometimes, in order to make change happen in your life, you have to change some things. So, I get the point.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:52.000
If you have one thing that is becoming so distracting to the point that you can't get anything else done, then yeah, I can understand taking a full step away from it to reorganize.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Exactly, and that's what sometimes people have to do.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I've done the same thing myself. I mean, you remember when I went Momo-free for a while, you know, especially since WoW kind of sucked at first. Sorry, sorry, sorry, hate.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:12.000
But I mean, some people need to do that. It's like people who drink, you know?

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:18.000
You either can cut it out a little bit and you're fine, or you have to cold turkey it and not drink at all.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Or smoking.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:25.000
You have to get to your other priorities and stop something that's getting in the way of a productive life.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Or smoking, Jamie, because some people can do it cold turkey, or some people have to do it cold turkey. Some people need the patch, or a support group, or you know.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Or you're my uncle and you smoke the electric cigarettes.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Which, actually, I will go ahead and say this. Nicotine, in and of itself, is as bad for you as caffeine. It's all the other crap in it.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:57.000
So anyway, but I do, I personally take exception to the real adult thing, but I understand it. You know?

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I'm more giving the emailer a hard time, but I just don't like the perception out there that not having some of those things makes you less successful.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:11.000
I actually kind of resent the notion a little bit. So, that's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:18.000
But the key was, he didn't say success or whatever. He said something else. But I just, sometimes, society puts these certain things out there.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:22.000
And I don't regret the decisions I've made. I have a great life. Thanks.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Yeah, same here. I mean, I'd like to have a job. Not for lack of trying.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Right.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:34.000
But at the same time, you know, I think that you can, and I've had to explain this to my mother.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And I always give her a hard time because I was like, how much of my Nintendo did you play when I was 12?

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:53.000
You know, you can be into gaming. You can be into, you know, people years older than me who are still majorly into every new anime that ever comes out.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:59.000
I'm not as much as I used to be, even though something comes out that I might like, or I like watching the old stuff.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:07.000
You know, everyone's got their thing. There's nothing wrong with enjoying something and having fun as long as you don't do it to the exception of all else.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Right.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.000
You know?

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
And I think that's the real point. Yes.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Exactly. And yeah, I'm not going to go off anymore about that, but I do have to say congratulations to you, Kirk, for your fantastic achievements.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
I mean, you lost a person.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:25.000
That's amazing.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:28.000
A hundred and twenty-one. Dan lost that much.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Yeah. Extifer from Hoard House lost a whole heck of a lot as well. And I know that took a lot of work and it's very impressive.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:41.000
Also, thank you, Fifth Dream, for not making me feel like I'm the oldest person in chat.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Hearts. That's it, Rob.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:48.000
That's it for the e-mails. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Before we get back into some gaming news, it's time for us to get a little ranty with a segment we call the F years of the week.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
This is fucked up.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:18.000
I guess the only a few that I have is to this cold that I got from Dan.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:27.000
But other than that, I'm looking at the Adobe site with tears in my eyes. I'm so happy.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:32.000
I'm seriously, like, shaking with joy.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:38.000
It's like Panto knocked on my door and said we want you to design everything in the world for us.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Well, that ruins the angsty segment.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:48.000
F you to that e-mailer for the generous gift for screwing up the FUs. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Oh, and F you to everyone putting spoilers out about Star Trek Into Darkness because I haven't seen it yet.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:01.000
And I'm not reading any reviews because they've all been spoilery.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Alright. Loki.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:13.000
F you to the, uh, to UEF for their controllers being all sorts of broken. Just the analogs. It's really annoying.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:21.000
It can be fixed with a software patch, but it's not really fixed. It's just kind of a workaround, I guess.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:25.000
It still sucks, though, because I'm trying to play some of these games and it's just like, ugh.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:28.000
That's it.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:36.000
My FU of the week goes to, I don't know, things are fairly well, so I don't have a lot of angst.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:42.000
F you to traffic on the way to the Bay Area because it took me three hours to make a drive that should take an hour and forty-five minutes.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:51.000
And F you to the Kabuki Theater in San Francisco, although actually it's kind of like the good kind of F you because, like,

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:59.000
I loved seeing that movie there so much because it was in a theater that served booze and they only let twenty-one and up people in there, so no babies!

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:07.000
And the reason why I say F you is now I want to see every movie at that theater in San Francisco and that's not possible.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:14.000
My movie-going experience bar has been forever changed because of that, so.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:16.000
The bar has been raised.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.000
That's right. The bar has been raised.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Okay, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then we will get to Twitter topics and our Skype line here eventually.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.000
So let's get to Loki.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:41.000
So there was an announcement a few months ago about Batman Arkham Origins and, you know, it was revealed that, hey, Batman's not going to be voiced by Kevin Conroy anymore.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
It's going to be a new person. And there was much bitching.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Well, thankfully now the deal has been put in place where, yes, Kevin Conroy will be Batman because he is Batman and he will be returning as the voice of Batman in the new game when it comes out in October.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Also revealed, thanks to an Amazon pre-order, there apparently will be DLC where Deathstroke will be playable in some form.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Probably like the challenge missions and the other games, but neat.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:21.000
I'm glad that they have the original voice coming back.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Now is Mark Hamill actually going to be doing the voice of the Joker again in this game or is it going to be just like...

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
I don't think the Joker's in it. I think that's how they got around it.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Yeah, but Mark Hamill has officially retired.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Sure he has.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.000
No, he actually really has retired. Apparently it was doing a number on his voice.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Well, so, yeah, Deathstroke would be kind of cool.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
I don't know.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Alright. I'm excited about the new game, but I'm a little worried that it's another... I think as a lot of people are, I kind of want to wait and see what the reviews look like or what the footage looks like coming out of E3.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Is it going to be as good? Is it going to meet that bar that was set by, you know, Arkham City and so forth? Or is it, you know... I don't know. We'll see.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Well, one more story for you guys and I apologize. It's political, but it is making the rounds on the gaming blogs this week.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:33.000
And it's a comment from Vice President Joe Biden. Now you might remember that when the whole horrible, horrible thing in the school in Connecticut broke out, Joe Biden started a task force.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:38.000
He was assigned by President Obama to talk about, you know, how do you curtail gun violence and so forth.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:50.000
And they did this whole thing about, you know, games and all this. In May, the Vice President met with 20 representatives from face-based organizations to talk about gun control and immigration.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:54.000
He talked about video games in this as well, according to Politico.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Franklin Graham, who is the son of Billy Graham, you know, the evangelistic is what you call him, said to the Vice President that, quote,

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:13.000
media and entertainment that portray violence should be subject to a special tax with the proceeds going to help victims and their family.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:18.000
And this is according to a rabbi, Rabbi Julie Schoenfeld, who was also in that session.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Biden said, quote, there's no, quote, no restriction on the ability to do that.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:30.000
There's no legal reason why they couldn't, end quote, do a tax on violent media.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Going on, the quote says he said they really need a good scientific study, which they've done on things like smoking.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:44.000
So what's interesting about this is that it's not necessarily limited to games, which I can appreciate for one,

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:51.000
is that, you know, I don't, you know, when they talk about, like, attacks on violent games, then I'm like, well, what about R-rated movies and NC-17 movies?

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:57.000
And what about things on TV and networks? Are they going to put a tax on the nightly news? Because maybe they ought to.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
You know, because it's pretty violent too.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
So are they going to tax the Bible because they believe it depicts violence?

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:05.000
Oh, snap.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:07.000
That would be hilarious.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Oh, snap.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
It's like, oh, hey, you know, thanks, thanks for mentioning that.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:15.000
And to be fair, just about any religious text.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Yes. So I think that's just ridiculous. The only way I could see them ever doing that is because we need the tax dollars.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:32.000
But other than that, I mean, it's just, it's kind of ridiculous. Because once again, you're just taxing things that don't necessarily have a direct correlation with violence.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:41.000
And again, the problem with this, it all goes back to the root problem with that California law that we spent all this money trying to defend.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.000
The Supreme Court overturned it because it was all up to somebody's interpretation.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:49.000
And how can you tax something that has to be interpreted?

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Because, and to be fair to the Vice President, even though I don't necessarily agree with what he said, he did say, we would need a really good scientific study.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.000
They would have to have facts.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.000
We're going to need to waste more money.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Yeah. Right. So I, but I just don't think it would be successful because what is violent?

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Somebody would have to set that line and it's too, it's too, what's violent to me might be not necessarily what's violent to you, what's not violent to Franklin Graham or Rabbi Julie Schoenfeld.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:34.000
And what they're ignoring is that there actually have been scientific studies that have disproven that violent video games are any more, aren't, what's the word I'm trying to think of?

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:46.000
They're just as likely as a movie or watching the news or reading a book. It's the same thing. They're as likely to cause violence as any other portrayal.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:43:00.000
And then what happens to media that's not rated? A lot of movies don't bother getting rated so that they can still come out in theaters without the NC 17 stigma attached to it because the NC 17 rating is a fucking waste.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:05.000
Well, and it's not like, you know, watching porn means I'm going to go sleep with the pizza man.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:17.000
It's just, well, I mean the whole, the whole rating system in itself is, is a really horrible joke in this. I'm not talking about the game ratings. The game ratings are actually better right now than the movie ratings. They really are.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:28.000
The movie ratings is in need of a serious, serious reorganization. I'm, I mean everything from the fact that you have R rated movies that are like saw level violent.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Then you have an R rated movie like Romeo and Michelle's high school reunion is an R rated movie because the F word is used more than once by Janine Garofalo's character.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:45.000
And I put like, I put a movie like Romeo and Michelle next to a movie like saw and I'm like, you know, we got a problem.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Well, Janine Garofalo is just an R rated actress, so it makes sense.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Well, then she also turned Scientologist, which just makes me roll my eyes and feel very sad.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:05.000
That's her thing. I don't care. That's, that's totally not the point I'm trying to make here is about the movie that it's, it's, it's a joke that a movie like that.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:16.000
I mean, should kids see it? Not necessarily, but I think, I think a 14 or a 15 year old could see it. It's no worse than there are. It's a movie about high school for fuck sake.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Like it's nothing different than what they're hearing at school. You know, it's silly.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:31.000
Interesting. Degenerate Johnny in chat at live.voggenetwork.com says FCC has been quoted to state that the ESRB is the best rating system of all entertainment.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:38.000
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says Evil Dead, the new one was originally rated NC 17 until they cut a few scenes out.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:45.000
You know what? I have zero interest in the new Evil Dead. Zero. I've heard things about the movie and I'm just like, no thanks.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:47.000
It does not have the chin.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.000
I don't care. I don't care.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:52.000
I can get you legit caught up.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
No, I really don't care. Thank you.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:59.000
I kind of want to see it, but it doesn't have Bruce. So what's the point?

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:01.000
He's in the cameo. See, I know that.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
I don't care. He's not a Bruce Campbell being in the movie movie.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:06.000
What kind of cameo does he have?

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:08.000
I don't remember.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Does he open the door for somebody?

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:12.000
I don't know. I don't remember.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Is he a manager at S-mart?

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:16.000
I don't know and I wouldn't want to spoil it.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Hey, I don't care. You know what? If the proceeds from this movie go to making an army of darkness 2, I don't care. It exists for a purpose.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Judge however you want to judge, but I will be there as I am every single year for the showing of showgirls at the Castro theater hosted by drag queens because I live for that shit.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Oh my god. I need to go again this year because I didn't go last year and I'm sad.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:46.000
So judge me all you want. I won't go see Evil Dead, but I'll go see showgirls for the 10th time in the theater.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Now I seriously think that they should kickstart a sequel to that movie.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Why we're talking about this on OLR, I don't know, but we're almost at the end of the show so we can do this.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:06.000
They got the girl that played Penny in the movie. If you've seen the movie, Penny was like the other stripper who was kind of like the blonde silly.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:08.000
The dumb blonde?

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Yeah, the dumb blonde stereotype basically. They actually got her there live at the theater. The Peaches Christ, the drag queen who does this, which by the way that's a great name.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Actually got her there and part of the reason she was there is that she had self financed or got a little group to finance showgirls to Penny's From Heaven.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Was the sequel. It's on IMDB and they actually were selling DVDs and they screened the movie earlier in the day.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:33.000
I need to see that.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:40.000
I haven't seen it. I'm not going to bother watching it. I thought she was a great sport for going and participating.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Apparently she is also, there's a showgirls off off Broadway production right now and she actually is in it right now as the character she played in the movie.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:53.000
This thing is great.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:00.000
I just realized I won't talk about Evil Dead but I know the in and outs of showgirls. It's so bad it's good.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:02.000
It's essentially the same thing.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:04.000
I can't help myself.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Rob. Rob. I love it.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:17.000
I don't like violence and body parts and animal violence. I love titties. I don't think that's such a terrible thing.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:27.000
And to be fair the sex scene in the pool kind of looked like she was being attacked by a shark. So I mean that's sort of similar to the violence you see in video games.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Alright.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:31.000
I mean seriously who does what she does?

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Alright. Anyhow we get to the show where it's time for

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Why weren't they trying to get her last year because, get Elizabeth Berkley because it was like the 20th anniversary or something?

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:42.000
They were trying to get her but I think she was pregnant.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Oh. Yeah. Even better.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Can't show up. Baby on the way.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Anyway we're about to the end of the show. We're going to get to last minute stories and Twitter topics and the Skype line.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:59.000
But in order to start getting the Skype calls I got to free up the Skype line which means I got to say bye to Jamie.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:00.000
So Jamie.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:04.000
That's okay. I'm lusting over the Adobe suite right now.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Yeah go install that.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Oh I'm already installing seven programs right now.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:13.000
Yeah save the audition license for me because I might want to check that out.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Guys I'm not downloading it.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Sorry you had to be here remotely. I know we really like to have everybody here in studio but with no show next week that's a lot of Jamie to be missing.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
So I'm glad we were able to come up with something else. Feel better.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:32.000
I actually am starting to feel a lot better. My drugs are doing the trick.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.000
The power of O.L.R. this show heals. Be healed.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:43.000
I have to tell you that Dan warned me about him being sick in enough time and that we had shared that soda that I started taking precautions.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
And so I'm not nearly as sick as I might have been.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
Gotcha. Well I'm glad to hear you're feeling.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Preventative medicine. It does the job.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:56.000
Either that or the Adobe just just miracle cure right there. Must have been.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:00.000
I'm going to try this news thing and see if it doesn't piss me off as much as Dreamweaver does.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:06.000
All right. Well Dark Sakura I'll run down the last bits of the show with you here.

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Do you have any final thoughts or do you have any last minute stories for our listeners.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:16.000
I actually do not. There was one attached to the Sega thing but it's a little bit outdated so I'm not going to bother.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:20.000
OK. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:31.000
I am going to Alabama and if any of our listeners in or near the south with transportation would like to drive me around because I won't have a car.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:33.000
I'll pay for your gas.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:37.000
You're hitchhiking with O.L.R. listeners Dark Sakura is that what this has come down to?

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Well you remember one of the times I went back like maybe about seven years ago.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:47.000
I went to Biloxi to a DDR tournament.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Oh yeah I remember that.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:53.000
It was a fifth mix machine and they had just gotten a fifth mix and we had had it for like ever.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:59.000
So I was you know perfect attacking stuff and you know they're like oh what do you think of this.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:06.000
Everyone was so nice. I love meeting the arcade folks and I got to go to my old arcade.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:11.000
So I'm going to try to make it by the cyber station at the former former Bell Air Mall at some point.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:13.000
You know it's to work there.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:19.000
We may not be the most popular podcast on the Internet but I really love it because you know what some podcasts out there.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.000
I'm going to ask you for one hundred thousand dollars on Kickstarter to meet stretch goals here at O.L.R.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:26.000
We just want to bum a ride.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Yeah I'm going to be staying in Daphne which is an hour out of Mobile and kind of don't want to be in Daphne the whole time while my mom's at work.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Oh gosh. All right well good luck to you and Pixar didn't happen.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:41.000
You'll probably just get pictures of oyster shells.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:45.000
It works for me. All right have a great night Jamie we'll see you back in a couple weeks here on O.L.R.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:47.000
Good night everybody hearts hearts hearts.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:48.000
All right bye bye.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:54.000
And I'm sure she'll be in chat to say good night to the listeners and so forth and finish out our show in the chat room.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:58.000
So if you want to stop on by if you happen to be listening live live dot vog network dot com.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:05.000
But if you want to say hi to dark soccer in the email bag you can always do that as well mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Let's get to the last minute stories and I'll start to read the Twitter topics and we will open up the phones at 1 877 game O.L.R.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:16.000
or username on Skype is orange launch radio. We're already getting calls.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:21.000
The words had barely escaped my mouth and we're already getting phone calls.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
So let's go to it. Hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
What up guys. It's Zeno from the OKC. How you been.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:29.000
Hey Zenocore I'm good. How you doing.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
You know making music here and there. Stuff like that.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Yeah. I didn't know you were. I didn't. At least I didn't remember you were a music maker. That's awesome.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Well it's a it's a recent thing I picked up over the past four or five months or so. Oh yeah.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Yep yep. Got stuff up on SoundCloud dot com slash Zenocore. Check it out when you have availability.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:50.000
Awesome plug. What's on your mind tonight.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:54.000
You guys are discussing the let's play situation. Mm hmm.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Yeah. Yeah. I still think Nintendo is going a bit overboard although I think it's a bit of an automatic attack just due to the way that their stuff is set up.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:14.000
They're just but taking the but taking the revenue it's really just putting like giving the guys a noogie on top of taking away their content.

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:29.000
I mean that's the way I look at it. I mean the fact that they're taking all the ad revenue as much of a trickle as it is for a company the size of Nintendo is really it's it's literally like snapping you know just doing that little extra to make a point.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Yeah but it's not just Nintendo right.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:42.000
Well yeah everybody has the luxury of doing it. I have seen other companies do it before but really I mean they'd be better off leaving it as open advertising for the games.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:53.000
I mean because on top of that the whole sandbox situation does apply. I mean the fact that they gave a product out for play the moment somebody starts playing it is completely different.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:53:04.000
Like you take a video games awesome live their their production for what they do on top of the game is tremendous and they do it not just for games but for releases and everything else too.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:09.000
If they're if they're going to cut that off they need to cut it off for all media that they do that with.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:14.000
So nobody is allowed to do anything unless they pay Nintendo some money.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:18.000
So meaning like like reviews and things or what.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Yeah I mean if they're not if they're not going to treat it underneath fair use then everybody who who openly plays that for longer than five minutes or so needs to pay Nintendo that.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:38.000
And I don't think like for instance Revision3 their reviews go on for eight or nine granted they're a big name they'd never undercut them but the little guys will step all over.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Or that I well one thing I was kind of thinking with this is that I'm surprised a lot of people have just said all right we'll just not use YouTube because YouTube could kind of get some of the blame in this too for kind of letting Nintendo or quote unquote letting Nintendo do it or split their videos up into what to say it's five minutes or 459.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:58.000
It's kind of a pain in the ass.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:02.000
It's a pain in the ass but you know whatever I mean if that's what needs to be done.

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:06.000
Well that's also going to cut into the then the viewers aren't going to be there either.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:16.000
And also you have to take into account how many video game tournaments are playing are paying rights because that that that many as far as I saw unless it's sponsored by the video game company themselves.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:23.000
That means the streams for Team Spooky are also going to be cut out so they can't show any of the video game tournaments as well as Evo coverage.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Well what about Twitch. I mean there's so much let's play that goes on on Twitch that's almost all that site is is let's play stuff.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:40.000
But yeah that means going up against Justin TV and if they really want to undercut Justin TV out of that much revenue that they'd have a court case fight there.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:49.000
I don't think there's an easy answer I kind of think it's going to go back to that guy on our Facebook that said it's going to it's going to take a legal precedent to really figure this out.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:55:00.000
You know and although you know sure it was a dick move on Nintendo's part and I think it would just been a better situation if they've all splitted the money or worked with the content people to try to figure out a solution rather than sick the lawyers on them.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:06.000
That probably would have been better but again they're not the first to do so and they won't be the last.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:08.000
Yep true true.

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Other thoughts Xenocore?

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:12.000
No that's pretty much it man you guys have a good show.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:18.000
All right thanks for tuning in and lending your perspective one more time for that SoundCloud it's SoundCloud.com slash Xenocore?

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Yeah give it a listen I think you'll like a lot of the stuff on there.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:22.000
What kind of music? Chiptune? Rock? What is it?

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:27.000
Yeah it's sponsored by the demo scene that's what I grew up with so it tends to mirror that but it's all over the place.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:29.000
All right nice I'll give it a listen. All right take care buddy.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:31.000
See you later.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:41.000
All right good call 1-877 excuse me yeah 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call. Loki?

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Tryon announced I guess that they've had some layoffs.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Oh I thought you were going to say something else with this. Tryon also Tryon Worlds announced that Rift is going free to play this past week.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
I don't know I thought that might have been where you were going with this.

02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:09.000
No no no they had layoffs so there was a lot of rumors on they haven't really said how many but it was like 70% 80% of the staff was one of the rumors but I don't think that they said that's that's far exaggerated.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:13.000
All right let's go to the phones we have another call coming in. Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Hey it's Prince Brightstar.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Prince Brightstar how you doing?

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:19.000
Pretty good yourself?

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:21.000
Good you said you were going to listen more often you've made good on that promise so thank you.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:23.000
I've tried to make it every week since.

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Awesome well what's on your mind tonight?

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:29.000
I've also got a comment about the whole let's play situation as well here.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:31.000
A lot of people do what's up?

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:41.000
Well I recently started doing a let's play myself particularly with Minecraft and also some of the fantasy star games.

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:48.000
I started this back in December but I have yet to monetize any of my stuff because I have yet to actually get into any of those networks.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:59.000
But my understanding on the whole situation with Nintendo is they're even monetizing for themselves stuff from the IGN network and game station and such like that.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:28.000
So I'm wondering if they have actually broken contracts in this and if it's time for the let's player community to actually get together host some sort of charity drive or rather a donation drive which will cover the fees for all this, the lawyer fees and actually take this to court because the laws are just very very out of date at this point to be able to cover something like let's plays.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
You mean fair use laws need to be reexamined?

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:39.000
Exactly because Nintendo may also be cutting into reviews and such which are allowed under fair use.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Well what about some of the things I was saying earlier like you can't do, I can't put an entire movie up and do talking over the movie but if I wanted to do a movie review I could obviously use little bits and pieces which I could still do with a Nintendo game.

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:59.000
But I can't exactly upload that to YouTube where I talk over a movie. I mean why is it different with games?

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:14.000
True and I agree with that and in that situation you can't do it. In fact what most people do currently is they go and sell their tracks sort of on a site like Rift Tracks or something like that.

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:23.000
The problem with video games is they're an interactive medium. So when you're watching a movie it's going to be the same for everybody regardless.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:35.000
If you're playing a video game your experience is going to be different. Granted I respect Nintendo and any other company for doing what they want to do because it's their game.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:46.000
But the gameplay itself and any commentary or putting their face on the video or putting their chat on the video as well, that's their property at that point.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:59:03.000
So what do you think as a let's play person yourself, let's say something's got to give here and Nintendo wants a little piece of the pie and a little bit of the revenue. What do you think would be a solution that would make everybody happy?

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:27.000
Honestly I think it's better that this doesn't actually go to court and each company either says you can do whatever you want or cut some sort of fee or say flat out you can't do this and don't post any videos to make it clear as to what you're allowed to do, what you're not allowed to.

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:37.000
And I think it's also up to the community to respect that and not put out videos that the company states they don't want videos out there.

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:50.000
Especially maybe for newer games. Having Let's Play of Bioshock Infinite before the game's actually released when a lot of people want to know what's the ending, that could be detrimental to the game.

02:59:51.000 --> 03:00:12.000
Exactly. Or for in a worst case game like say Aliens Colonial Marines, if all those reviews hadn't come out so quickly and I realize this hurts the community even more but with the reviews and also the embargo that was out, people weren't able to cancel their pre-orders before it was too late on that game.

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:17.000
Good point. Alright well Prince Brightstar, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:19.000
That's it for tonight.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:20.000
Alright, you take care buddy. Thanks for listening.

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:22.000
Alright.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:29.000
Alright, bye bye. We'll try to squeeze in one more call. 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Other stories, Loki?

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:38.000
They said there's going to be another dashboard update or there's a rumor that another dashboard update is going to come to the Xbox 360 before the next system comes out.

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:40.000
Interesting.

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:45.000
Saying that it's going to update the interface again to make it look more like Windows.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:51.000
Do you think this could be because of some of the rumors about the set-top boxes that are going to come out really cheap?

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:56.000
I don't know about that but maybe they're just trying to update it so it looks nicer or something. I don't know.

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:58.000
I just hate when they keep changing your face though.

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Let's go to the phones and take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:07.000
Hey, this is your opening act for I guess this is the last time I guess. After all the shots fired.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:16.000
I'll let it slide this one time but you make another Chrono Triggers better than Super Metroid joke and it's over. I'm kidding. It's all good fun. What's up Bobby?

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:24.000
So I just wanted to repeat something that I've actually been repeating and it's one thing that a lot of people don't realize about this whole Nintendo Let's Play thing.

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:30.000
Just because it's free advertising doesn't mean they have to want it.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:36.000
And I think that's something that a lot of people, they're like, oh it's free advertising, why wouldn't they want it?

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:41.000
Maybe they don't. Maybe they want to control more of the advertising.

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:50.000
And so the argument of it's free advertising, they should be happy with it. There's free advertising that I've gotten over the past eight years that I haven't wanted.

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:54.000
Ooh, that's a good analogy. That's a really good analogy.

03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:05.000
Is that sometimes people will say something and kind of use your site or your show or something and you're kind of like, I don't know if I would necessarily have said that myself.

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:08.000
Yeah, that's a really good analogy.

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:13.000
So just because it's free advertising doesn't mean they necessarily want it.

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:24.000
The difference between Minecraft, the reason I fully support Notch for his position is because he's not telling a story in Minecraft. He gave an actual sandbox.

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Yeah, that's true.

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:32.000
And you're telling your own stories, whereas a Let's Play of Luigi's Mansion, you're telling the Luigi's Mansion story.

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:40.000
Granted, you're going right or left whenever you want to, but you're still telling Nintendo's story.

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:55.000
Yeah, but you could say that sandbox games, you know, say if I go and just run around in Saints Row the Third and just not necessarily play in the story stuff, but just kill people or do silly stuff, that that should be fair because I'm not telling stories.

03:02:56.000 --> 03:03:01.000
And I agree with you on that, but that's different than playing the Saints Row the Third story.

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:11.000
That's kind of where my line is. Like, yes, screw it around in Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row or Minecraft, absolutely that should be fair use.

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:16.000
Or Machinima is a great example.

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:24.000
Except with Microsoft's game content rules, you have to work out with them if you're going to do Machinima.

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
Microsoft laid the hammer down on that.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:36.000
Fifth Dream says they don't want Nintendo games associated with loud cursing and stoners. Interesting.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Well, I don't think that's all of your Let's Play people, but certainly there are some Let's Play people. Hell, we did Mass Effect drunk the other night and maybe BioWare didn't appreciate that. I don't know.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:56.000
But once again, though, they need to get with it. I mean, sorry that, you know, Microsoft's not saying that they don't want their games associated with, you know, stoners and loud moths and stuff like that.

03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:01.000
But they keep saying that they keep like going back and forth with what they want.

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:07.000
We're going to make games that appeal to core gamers and stuff, or we're going to make family games.

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:13.000
Or we're going to make it so that it's more friendly for third parties and now we're going to make first party games and stuff.

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:22.000
I think that they need to figure out what their focus is instead of trying to like, I don't think they know what their focus is almost.

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:28.000
Like they're trying to appeal to people that aren't buying their system or something. I don't really know what it is.

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:44.000
Yeah. But what a really interesting point is that they may not want the advertising. You know, it just kind of makes me think like, you know, I'm really appreciative that there's many of you out there that put like O-L-R in your usernames or your clan names or O-L-R or V-O-G, you know, for VOG and so forth.

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:56.000
And I think that's really awesome to help spread the word. But you better not be acting like an idiot when you're doing that because then it makes people go, I don't know what this VOG thing is, but what a bunch of assholes, you know, and that's not good.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
That's not the advertising we want.

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:08.000
I think it's necessarily that, you know, maybe these people are fans of those, you know, those games and so they're excited about that. It's not necessarily like spread advertising.

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:14.000
I mean, because no one needs to advertise Super Mario Brothers. Everyone knows what the fuck Super Mario Brothers is for the most part.

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:22.000
I mean, obviously, you know, we've seen some pictures from Super Mario World and Super Metroid that people don't know, you know, how to play that.

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:32.000
But I'm just saying that for the most part, people are aware of what it is. It's not necessarily free advertising, but it's, I don't know, it's just a unique take on it with the Let's Play stuff.

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:42.000
Unless you're just straight playing through the game without any sort of commentary on it. It's really hard to say that you're taking anything away from them, I guess. I don't know.

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:53.000
But it's still, yeah, it's free advertising, but Nintendo may not want that advertising and maybe they're okay with the Let's Play community saying we're not going to do Nintendo videos anymore. Maybe that's what they want.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:06:03.000
And so this is, you know, they're kind of doing, oh yeah, we're the good guys. Oh, well, you didn't want to take our offer, so, you know, okay, have fun doing the Microsoft and the Sony stuff.

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:06.000
Well, no, they won't be doing Microsoft either.

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:10.000
Yeah, but Microsoft hasn't gone through with YouTube.

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:17.000
Well, they haven't, but, I mean, they did kind of make the first move in this whole thing a few months ago.

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:33.000
Still, that's even weird, though, that they would, because once again, I would see that as strange if they're going to try to put out these sort of features where they're trying to get people to broadcast on Twitch and broadcast on YouTube and stuff and share all these videos and things.

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:36.000
Oh, but we don't want you to do that. Or at least don't want you to make a living.

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.000
No, they don't want you to make money doing it.

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:41.000
Well, pardon me, tell me how I should make my money.

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:58.000
Nintendo's not pulling a Sega, Microsoft's not pulling a Sega, but they're just saying you can't, and at least Microsoft has a licensing path so you can make money from it, but it's probably, you wouldn't be able to recoup the licensing costs unless you were machinima.com or Revision3 or one of these larger sites.

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:09.000
Well, what we need to do is we just need to have some sort of reform to this whole, you buy the game, you get the game thing instead of it being a license, because this is where all the bullshit's coming from, is fuckin' licensing software.

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:20.000
It needs to be you own that shit. Not that you can turn around and say, okay, I buy Halo 4, Halo 4 is mine, and I'm gonna sell copies of it and claim that it's, you know, Loki's Halo 4.

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:26.000
Yeah, but that's exactly what you're saying, is that, you know, in order to own it, you have to be able to do that.

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:42.000
I'm sure that we can kind of come to a sort of happy medium where, if it, unless it's about piracy, you know, just straight up piracy that you at least own the stuff that you have, like, you know, I, just because I own a car doesn't mean that I've manufactured those cars.

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:48.000
I can't go and clone my car and expect to get away with it, but that car is mine, I can do whatever the hell I want to it.

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:57.000
Alright, well, no easy answer to this, and I'm sure the conversation will be continuing through the next few weeks, especially when we see what other companies are gonna follow in Nintendo's footsteps, because I bet there'll be at least one.

03:07:57.000 --> 03:08:12.000
But, Bobby, before I let you go, earlier in the show we were talking about some of our predictions for Tuesday's Xbox announcements, and I was kind of curious, since, you know, you are the opening act and everything, as you say, what are your thoughts?

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:33.000
I mostly agree with you guys, they're not gonna, no price, no date. I still think, I do think Xbox Infinity is gonna be the name, I know that they'll give the name, I know that they'll show a couple games, but I think they'll talk more about the entertainment offerings and stuff.

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:46.000
But you gotta realize, this is also being broadcast live on TV, right? So they're probably gonna try to reach everything and leave a lot of the core stuff, maybe, to E3, I don't know.

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:57.000
I do think it's funny, and I mentioned this in chat and I don't think you guys picked up on it, about the Space Poncho thing, they have gone full board with the Twitter handle Xbox Reveal Tent.

03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:13.000
And it's actually an official Microsoft person actually posting as the tent, and it's been tweeting for like the last week as they've been setting things up, so they're actually making the tent that the Reveal's taking place in a character, and fully embracing that.

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:18.000
So that's probably gonna be the Space Poncho of this year, or at least, that's what Microsoft hopes the Space Poncho of this year is gonna be.

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:24.000
You have to understand, you can't force Space Poncho, Space Poncho is just something that happens, it's a natural thing.

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:32.000
You can't just make a viral video, the video has to go viral, it's different. Good point, good point.

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:35.000
So Bobby, you looking forward to checking out Gran Turismo 6 when it comes out?

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:41.000
Did Gran Turismo 5 ever come out? I will get to play Saints Row 4.

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:46.000
Oh yeah, yes, I know you're looking forward to E3, it's only a few weeks away.

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:53.000
I did get my appointment time, it's Wednesday morning, that's when I'll be playing Saints Row 4, they said they're actually gonna have a playable portion.

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:59.000
I hope I'm there with you so I can pick up the phone and actually call Loki after that and hand you the phone.

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:04.000
Yeah, I got to play Saints Row 4 as well, I downloaded The Trouble with Clones expansion as well.

03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:09.000
Alright, that's it, we're ending the show. Alright Bobby, any other quick final thoughts before I let you go?

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000
Chrono Trigger greater than Super Metroid?

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:14.000
That was a bad final thought and for that I'm hanging up. Goodbye.

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:17.000
That would be an incorrect thought.

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:24.000
Alright, we're gonna close up the Skype line. I'm really sorry, there were a few of you still trying to call that didn't get through.

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:30.000
I'm very sorry but we are running a little over and I have to do some things after the show.

03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:36.000
Do remember you can always tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r, you can also email us, mailbag at orangesontrated.com.

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000
That's a great way to get all of your thoughts out.

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:45.000
Let me, speaking of twitter, go to the twitter real quick. Loki, I don't know if you had any other last minute stories real quick here.

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:51.000
Not really, it's just a story that they've already talked about doing this before but they're replacing Microsoft points with real money.

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:59.000
Tigerclaw tweeting us that BlazBlue anime is getting a fall release in Japan. I didn't know they were making an anime about BlazBlue.

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:00.000
That makes sense though.

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:01.000
That's pretty cool.

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:04.000
They're making a game for Guilty Gear so that's pretty cool.

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000
A good way to kind of enhance things.

03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:14.000
Misty is sending us some tweets from ASEN because she was at the show and she tweeted us some pictures from Pinkberry.

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:19.000
Thanks for rubbing it in Misty because I wish I could be there right now because that cookies and cream flavor is so good.

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:27.000
But there's that free advertising that maybe Pinkberry doesn't want the advertising we keep giving them on our show.

03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:28.000
We should stop that.

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:33.000
Spazinator tweeting us his Facebook fan page for his kitty Anakin.

03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000
That is a cute cat.

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:41.000
See now I'm looking at cat pics but I like that you set up a whole little Facebook.

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:49.000
Smiling Yoshi tweets us and says, smiling Yoshi wonders if he'll someday be subject to Nintendo's defense of copyrights.

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:52.000
I mean, I'm a Yoshi doll and I'm so darn cute.

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:54.000
Oh, I remember this account.

03:11:54.000 --> 03:12:00.000
This is a Twitter account that's this little dolly Yoshi that makes all these tweets and it's really cute.

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000
See, there's smiling Yoshi.

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:03.000
So it's a little doll.

03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:06.000
Imagine like a garden gnome that goes everywhere and tweets from all over.

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:07.000
Yeah, I have that doll.

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:08.000
Oh, okay. There you go.

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:12.000
Well, I should say Josh has that doll but we have that doll in the house.

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:18.000
Well, so smiling Yoshi is worried that maybe Nintendo is going to shut down this Twitter account.

03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:28.000
I don't think you have anything to worry about because at least, you know, I'm looking at your user icon which is Yoshi kind of setting on your feet or a friend's feet or something like that.

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:36.000
And I'm thinking, you know, that picture is like 5% Yoshi and 95% a body in a room.

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.000
So I think you'd be okay.

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:41.000
I think that would actually be okay with fair use laws.

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000
Just so you know.

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:48.000
ActDeaf tweeting us, Guilty Gear XRD sign got announced today.

03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:50.000
Yeah, that's the game I was talking about.

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:51.000
I didn't know there was a, oh, okay.

03:12:51.000 --> 03:13:06.000
I think it's kind of funny though that name though, you know, XRC sign or XRD sign because it's like all the, you know, games have been like Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus or like, you know, they have like some sort of weird symbol after them.

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:12.000
So it's like XRD, it's like X entry into the series and some random sign.

03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:15.000
And lastly, a tweet from Eric RPG.

03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:18.000
People often say devs are high when they make game ideas.

03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:20.000
Here's one put to practice, maybe.

03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:30.000
And he tweets us a link to something over on Destructoid about the game Demon Cheek, like it's chic and it's new.

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:41.000
And I guess this is coming out of the Destructoid podcast where, oh, where they take, oh, they talk about things on the podcast that ought to be turned into video games.

03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:45.000
But it looks like somebody actually turned this idea into a video game.

03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000
What a novel idea.

03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:50.000
Do you listen to this show every week, Eric?

03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:52.000
Because the same thing happened to us, not that long.

03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:55.000
Maybe that's why he tweeted it to us, actually.

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:58.000
If only someone would make a game like, you know, about...

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:01.000
Bungee Ferret talking like we said ought to be a game.

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:04.000
If only that was available on Xbox Live indie games.

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:12.000
But anyway, Demon Cheek is apparently a crossbreed between WarioWare, Earthbound, and the Curse of Monkey Island.

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:14.000
I don't even know how that goes together there.

03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:20.000
But I guess if you're a fan of Destructoid's podcast, then there's lots of lolsy in-jokes there for you.

03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:22.000
Well, fine.

03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:25.000
If Podtoid's gonna get a game, then you know what I want?

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:26.000
You know what I want?

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:28.000
I want two games.

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000
One game isn't good enough anymore.

03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:36.000
Alright. Anyhow.

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:39.000
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000
Because that was it for Last Minute Stories, right?

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000
Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show.

03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:46.000
If you like our show, remember this is an indie production.

03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:49.000
We do do everything here, you know, for free.

03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:52.000
We don't really monetize the show like maybe we ought to.

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:55.000
But we do pay out of pocket to do the show.

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.000
And you know what? We just love the community.

03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:00.000
We like paying the money to spend time with our friends every week.

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:02.000
All we ask, help us grow our community.

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:04.000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:06.000
And help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:08.000
It helps.

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:10.000
And keep showering dark soccer with gifts.

03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000
Because she really likes that too.

03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.000
And gets her all verklempt.

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:16.000
That was really awesome though.

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:18.000
That was a great idea too.

03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:21.000
I love that because it's something that in turn will just help vog in general.

03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000
So that's awesome.

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:25.000
Anyhow.

03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:27.000
Before we close up shop, we gotta go around and get final thoughts.

03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:29.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:39.000
My final thought is that I showed quite a bit of self restraint in this digital games mayhem sale on Amazon.

03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:42.000
Because I didn't buy a lot of this.

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000
I buy random weird shit.

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:46.000
But I only bought two things.

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:49.000
I bought, was it the Sam and Max collection.

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000
Which is all three seasons of Sam and Max.

03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:54.000
So that's like 18 episodes of gaming to play.

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:58.000
And then Scene02 because I didn't have it yet on Steam.

03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:00.000
So it'll be pretty good.

03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:02.000
And, and, and.

03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:06.000
I need people to give me suggestions for game night.

03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:09.000
Because otherwise I'm just gonna pick something at random.

03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:12.000
It may end up being Call of Duty or something.

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.000
Because I can't think of...

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:20.000
Or we'll play Minecraft again and Bobby will show up and it'll be just me and him again.

03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:24.000
But no seriously I need some suggestions.

03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:27.000
And whether or not you guys want to do Thursday or Friday.

03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:30.000
Because Friday might have to start a little bit later in Friday.

03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:32.000
Because Josh usually stays up a little bit later.

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:35.000
Because we try to get him to leap in a little bit later.

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:39.000
But it'll be like 8, 8.30ish.

03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:43.000
And I think that way we can play a lot longer.

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:48.000
Because we won't have to worry about work day next day.

03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:50.000
For most people.

03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:53.000
But yes let me know on the forums what you want to play.

03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:56.000
So we can consider that.

03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:00.000
Alright. A couple of final thoughts from me.

03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:03.000
I will echo what Bobby Blackwolf in chat is saying.

03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:05.000
Some VOG announcements coming on June the 2nd.

03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000
So stay tuned for that.

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000
Horde House has a big surprise this week.

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000
So tune in on Wednesday at 7 o'clock Pacific to hear that.

03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.000
So I guess just plugs from me.

03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:15.000
So there you go.

03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:18.000
That's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:20.000
We will be back probably in two weeks.

03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:22.000
But stay tuned to our Twitter.

03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:24.000
Just in case we're able to pull out a show during Memorial Day weekend.

03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:25.000
We'll let you know.

03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.000
But otherwise have a great week.

03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:30.000
For those of you in the States have a great three day weekend on Memorial Day.

03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:32.000
For those of you throughout the rest of the world.

03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:34.000
Have a great week whatever you're doing.

03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:36.000
And E3 is almost here you guys.

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:38.000
Lots of gaming news coming at you.

03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:40.000
Brace yourselves for this Xbox thing on Tuesday.

03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:42.000
It should be interesting.

03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:44.000
Have a great week everybody.

03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:46.000
And have fun. Bye.

03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:49.000
