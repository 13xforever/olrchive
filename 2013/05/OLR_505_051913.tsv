7000	13000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
13000	19000	Tonight, May 19th, 2013, Nintendo makes a controversial move against Let's Play videos.
19000	25000	Virtual trading cards come to Steam, and a new Gran Turismo game is announced for the PlayStation 3.
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May 19th, 2013, episode number 505 of our show.
45000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about games and gaming news with all you in our chat and listening on our podcast feed.
53000	58000	And my co-hosts. Joining us remotely tonight, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
58000	59000	Hi.
59000	60000	Hi, how are you doing?
60000	61000	I has a cold.
61000	63000	I'm sorry to hear it. How'd you get that?
63000	64000	Dan.
64000	65000	Aw.
65000	70000	He's like, I just have allergies, let's share a soda. Oops, sorry, it was cold.
70000	76000	I thought maybe he might have got something at that whole PinnaGogo thing. Did you go to that, which was this weekend?
76000	79000	He was, I think, already sick before that.
79000	80000	Don't.
80000	88000	So, but he only got to do one day at PinnaGogo and missed like their annual pinball group barbecue.
88000	94000	Now for those who don't know what PinnaGogo is, it's this big pinball exposition thing they do in NorCal.
94000	95000	Dixon.
95000	99000	Dixon. There ain't shit in Dixon either. It's a weird place for PinnaGogo.
99000	103000	No, there's stuff in Dixon. There's pollen and a really good ice cream parlor.
103000	106000	And they don't even have a 24 hour Starbucks anymore. Alright, anyway.
106000	108000	But they do have a Mary's Pizza Shack.
108000	111000	Yeah, they do. And they do have PinnaGogo, which is pretty awesome.
111000	118000	Apparently this year was supposed to be like totally bombed. They had every spot filled. They couldn't take any more people in because of power usage.
118000	129000	And I really wanted to go because they had all kinds of prototype machines and they had the new X-Men table and like all kinds of stuff I really wanted to go.
129000	134000	But Dan was sick and I wasn't going to go without him because I have no other reason to go to Dixon.
134000	140000	And who can blame you? Alright, we'll also say hello to here in studio, Techmaster Loki.
140000	141000	Hi.
141000	142000	How are you, Techmaster Loki?
142000	145000	I'm fine. I'm organizing Steam games.
145000	152000	Now, what was this you were trying to figure out? Maybe one of our listeners knows because we do have the live chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
152000	158000	When we are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
158000	161000	We do have the chatters joining us. Maybe one of them knows the answer to your question.
162000	168000	Well, I was just wondering if there is a way to... Oh, I guess there's different categories and stuff you could say.
168000	174000	Just seeing if there is a way to like, you know... Oh, okay. Here we go. Categories. You can add categories to the games.
174000	182000	Basically the folder sort. Some of the games I have because I have now over 100 games. Thank you, Amazon.
182000	185000	Do they have a crazy sale recently or something?
185000	192000	They're still going until the end of the month. It's their like... I don't remember what they call it. Their mega sale or something.
192000	197000	There's like a whole bunch of games and bundles and stuff. There's some really good Sonic bundles.
197000	204000	If you like Sonic the Hedgehog, you can get almost all the games that they have on PC including the Genesis stuff for like 20 bucks.
204000	207000	So it's like a Steam sale but it's on Amazon.
207000	213000	Actually, that's the thing. I've been finding a lot of these sales on Steam games on other sites.
213000	222000	Like Green Man Gaming or Amazon. Amazon for a lot of the stuff. Even Gamefly has stuff and it's all redeemable on Steam.
222000	227000	Or Origin. They actually have some games on Origin that I really wanted but I am not installing Origin.
227000	229000	I don't blame you, sir.
229000	234000	I'm passing on it. Battlefield 3 was $10. I really wanted Battlefield 3.
234000	238000	I wanted to sell my soul to play Mass Effect 3 online on the PC.
238000	244000	And I really wanted Command & Conquer. Thankfully, I wanted Red Alert 3 because I forgot all about it.
244000	254000	And I went back and started playing some of the older games but I saw in the trailer for it that they have George the K is in it.
254000	257000	Wasn't Tim Curry in that one too?
257000	261000	Tim Curry is in it. Yes, Tim Curry is in it. And they even have...
261000	267000	Oh, who the hell is it? I can see her face and I can't think of her name.
267000	269000	Jenny McCarthy is in it. She plays Tanya.
269000	270000	Random.
270000	273000	Yeah, she plays the assassin chick.
273000	275000	But yeah, it's so awesome.
275000	281000	Because they went back in the second game. I don't know if they had the full motion video cutscenes.
281000	286000	But they went back to the way that the first game was where they had full motion video cutscenes.
286000	294000	It's just awesome. But it also has origin and I'm not doing that. So, I'm sorry.
294000	300000	Going to the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, ActDeft says you can sort your games in your Steam library.
300000	305000	So you can at least sort them differently. I don't know.
305000	307000	Yeah, I'll just have to mess around with it.
307000	314000	Alright. Well, we're going to get to how was your gaming week and the types of things you've been playing this week.
314000	317000	But before we do, I wanted to do a quick kick-off topic.
317000	321000	Obviously, this week we have the big Xbox reveal is coming up on Tuesday.
321000	324000	And we've had rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor this, rumor that.
324000	329000	Always online, always not. Xbox 720, Xbox Infinity.
329000	334000	Going to replace your cable system. Going to have Kinect built in.
334000	340000	I thought now would be a good time to talk about what are your final predictions for what is going to happen on Tuesday.
340000	344000	I don't know if we're going to actually have a show next week. Memorial Day weekend.
344000	347000	Because Dark Soccer is going to be out of town. We already knew that.
347000	351000	I may actually be out of town as well. So if there's two out of three of us are out of town.
351000	352000	I'll just talk.
352000	355000	Loki will do the one man show. Didn't you do that one year?
355000	357000	I've done it a couple times.
357000	360000	Yeah, those shows are really interesting you guys.
360000	363000	You can discuss pizza and bacon.
363000	367000	I might. If I've got stuff to talk about it sounds so bad.
367000	369000	But trying to stretch like, you know.
369000	374000	It's more fun when it's live and we have the chatters for that kind of instant feedback too.
374000	376000	Even when we're wrong.
376000	378000	I can team up with Bobby I guess.
378000	379000	Wrong? Us?
379000	384000	There you go. You can team up with Bobby. But I don't think Bobby's looking for a partner.
384000	386000	That would be hilarious.
386000	390000	But he's my only friend on multiple gaming services.
390000	395000	Alright, let's talk about final predictions for the new Xbox.
395000	399000	I guess I will start with our resident loud mouth Loki. And I say that with love.
399000	403000	Well, I'll tell you. We'll just start with what we're not going to see.
403000	408000	We're not going to see a date other than holiday. We're not going to see a price.
408000	411000	And we're not going to hear anything about DRM.
411000	413000	So you can just forget about that.
413000	417000	That's going to have to come with press asking follow up questions.
417000	420000	They're not going to say, oh by the way use games. Nope.
420000	422000	I don't think they're even going to do that.
422000	424000	Like I said, that's going to be really weird.
424000	428000	Although there are some stories that make me wonder if there is something coming.
428000	432000	But once again, everybody has to be on board. Not just them.
432000	436000	All platforms have to be on board with it in order for it to work.
436000	438000	So it's not going to happen.
438000	444000	I don't even know what we're going to really see as far as new games.
444000	448000	I mean, specs. They're going to show us specs.
449000	451000	They may show us a box.
451000	455000	I mean, if you think about it, how hard would it be for them to mock up something.
455000	457000	It doesn't have to be exactly like that.
457000	460000	It can change once it goes to retail, but they can mock up something.
460000	464000	Just have it there so that people can not bitch about it.
464000	468000	And things do change before retail.
468000	469000	Exactly.
469000	471000	I think about the PlayStation 3 boomerang.
471000	473000	Oh yeah, the PlayStation 3.
473000	476000	It's going to be 1080p at 120 frames per second.
477000	480000	It's going to have 20 USB ports in the background.
480000	485000	It's going to have a million USB ports and three HDMI ports or something.
485000	487000	What do you even need that for?
487000	489000	Well, if you want to...
489000	490000	A daisy chain.
490000	496000	HDMI in, HDMI audio to your receiver, and HDMI to your TV.
496000	497000	Whatever.
498000	500000	I don't know. They'll probably just talk specs.
501000	504000	I think they're going to focus a lot on the entertainment stuff.
504000	510000	With the whole taking over your TV, being an entertainment hub.
510000	512000	I just hope there's something cool.
514000	518000	I just don't want to see connect, connect, connect, connect, connect.
518000	521000	With the new video game console, you want to say something cool?
521000	523000	Yeah, I know. It's shocking.
523000	526000	I have decided I am going to get a new video game console this year.
526000	528000	I am going to buy one of those at launch.
529000	531000	My money's on Wii U.
532000	533000	For you, Loki.
533000	535000	No. No, no, no, no.
535000	537000	There could be a price cut at E3.
537000	539000	It'd have to be a pretty big price cut.
539000	542000	My wife played Animal Crossing today.
542000	544000	Or tried to get Josh to play Animal Crossing.
544000	546000	That's a slippery slope right there.
546000	547000	Uh oh, uh oh.
547000	548000	He doesn't quite get it.
548000	549000	How old is Josh now?
549000	551000	He's almost three.
551000	552000	Okay.
552000	553000	Slippery slope.
553000	555000	Let's go over to Dark Sakura.
555000	559000	Dark Sakura, I know you don't totally care about things, Microsoft.
559000	563000	But out of curiosity, what do you think might come of Tuesday's presentation?
563000	567000	I'm actually going to second a lot of what Loki said.
567000	569000	Just because I'm sure we're not going to get a specific date.
569000	571000	We're not going to get a specific price point.
571000	572000	We'll get a name.
572000	576000	We'll get a few screen captures of video games that are actually PC screen captures.
577000	580000	More about it, you know, being for entertainment.
580000	581000	The multiple use.
581000	587000	You know, pictures of actor families together looking happy and waving their hands around looking stupid.
587000	589000	Stupid and happy. Stupid and happy people.
589000	592000	You know, the name confirmation.
592000	593000	Just the use.
593000	598000	I mean, I've seen so many Sega announcements and they've been the same.
598000	600000	I'm not saying, what am I saying, Sega?
600000	602000	Xbox announcements.
602000	604000	And they've been the same type of thing every year.
604000	608000	I think it's just going to be their usual pattern.
608000	610000	I'm not going to be surprised by anything.
610000	613000	Cirque du Soleil this year? Space ponchos?
613000	614000	No.
614000	617000	No. Well, the thing was that the...
617000	618000	Information-wise.
618000	621000	The actual, like, tent is the space poncho.
621000	623000	It's like you're in the space poncho.
623000	625000	It's like meta space poncho.
626000	627000	Alright, anything else?
627000	628000	That's what it should be.
628000	634000	Hey, you guys like the hashtag so much, we now present the Xbox space poncho.
635000	642000	And they'll have EA humping them in the background and it won't sell in Japan.
644000	647000	Alright, anything else you want to say about that, DarkSagra?
648000	651000	Alright, going to our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com.
651000	654000	Some comments on Loki's possible solo podcast next week.
654000	656000	Alan Alchemy in chat says,
656000	660000	Loki's totally rational and not loud Nintendo critique and discussion hour.
661000	663000	I am 100% rational.
663000	667000	And I am only... I critique because I love.
668000	672000	Dark Tetsuya says, Loki's bacon pizza podcast, where do I descr...
672000	674000	Where do I subscribe?
675000	678000	At the hospital when you guys all have heart attacks.
678000	679000	That's where you subscribe.
679000	680000	That's not going to happen.
680000	682000	Alright, my turn.
682000	684000	So, what do I predict for Tuesday?
684000	686000	Definitely you're going to have the name. That's for sure.
686000	690000	Finally, we can stop calling it the 720 and we'll know the real name.
690000	692000	Unless it is the 720, which would be hilarious.
692000	695000	Please, no. Please, Microsoft, no.
695000	696000	We've spun around twice!
696000	698000	I still vote for the lube.
698000	700000	I love the name Xbox the lube.
700000	706000	Xbox infinity seems probable, but I do think that's more internet wank.
706000	708000	I think it's just simply something you haven't heard.
708000	710000	My money is on Fusion. Xbox Fusion.
710000	712000	You think it's on Fusion? We'll see.
713000	715000	Also, you will get...
715000	720000	I think they are going to one-up what Sony did and I think they will show you what it looks like.
720000	722000	Even though it is, of course, subject to change.
722000	726000	Absolutely not on the date. Absolutely not on the price.
726000	728000	That will be E3.
728000	733000	And I think one thing y'all need to be prepared is that there's not going to be a lot of games shown.
733000	737000	Because they've already pretty much come out and said, E3 is all about the games.
737000	740000	And I think that's a really risky move on Microsoft's part.
741000	743000	Because I can just see the Twitter snark now.
743000	745000	Where are the games?
745000	749000	Well, they did say they're going to show the Call of Duty ghost thing.
749000	751000	That will be shown.
751000	753000	But that's one game.
753000	755000	And that's a game we already kind of knew is coming.
755000	757000	I don't think you're going to see any bang up.
757000	760000	Okay, let's go to rumor wankville.
760000	762000	Let's go to the wankiest of wanks.
762000	763000	You ready?
763000	767000	If there's a new Killer Instinct game on this Xbox, you ain't seeing it tomorrow.
767000	769000	That would be an E3 surprise.
769000	772000	That would be the end of the E3 presentation.
772000	775000	If they're going to pull out that kind of wank, that's when that's coming.
775000	778000	I want to see him do something like that and then just drop the mic at the end.
778000	780000	Just drop the mic and walk off the stage.
780000	782000	It's like, done.
782000	784000	Or just fire a gun.
784000	786000	Shots fired, Sony.
786000	788000	Bam, we're out.
791000	793000	I think it's going to be a lot.
793000	800000	I think it's a lot about trying to get the tech world kind of buzzed up a little bit.
800000	803000	And I think you're going to see much more on the...
803000	809000	If it's true that they want to replace your cable box, which I think could be a likely thing.
809000	812000	I think we're going to see a lot more about that.
812000	819000	And definitely, definitely interaction between Windows 8 and how you can interact with things on your PC.
819000	824000	And how the PC will work as, you know, pretty much what you've already seen with Windows Media Center.
824000	826000	But I think they're going to kind of bump it up a little bit.
826000	828000	And Windows Phone.
828000	832000	Because, you know, it's all about the synergy between all those different Microsoft phones.
832000	837000	It'll be all tablets and, you know, iOS.
837000	840000	They know that they're limiting themselves.
840000	844000	No one is going to buy a Windows Phone for the next Xbox.
844000	846000	But any of that stuff?
846000	850000	The snark in you ought to be asking, will Microsoft let it last more than a year?
850000	852000	Or is it going to be the next Game Room?
852000	854000	The next Smart Glass?
854000	856000	The next HD DVD drive?
856000	860000	Or on top of that, is half the stuff that they're even going to show actually going to be possible?
860000	864000	Remember, hey, I'm scanning the bottom of my skateboard to bring the artwork into the game.
864000	869000	Versus, hey, I'm scanning my picture so that I can get a color for my car.
869000	873000	And it always looks pink because the lighting in my room sucks.
873000	876000	I think you will see some games.
876000	879000	Like a limited amount. I think it's going to be a lot of kind of what we already know about.
879000	884000	And maybe like a teaser reel of stay tuned to E3 for more on this.
884000	888000	You know, like a full motion video that will make no sense at the very end.
888000	892000	And like, you want to see what this is? Stay tuned for E3.
892000	894000	That's how it'll end or something like that.
894000	897000	It'll end with Square Enix coming out.
897000	902000	We're going to have, we would like to announce a game that we're going to announce at E3.
902000	908000	EA will walk out on stage and go, we are going to give our full support to the next Xbox.
908000	913000	We believe the next Xbox is the future of gaming and we are going to partner up with it.
913000	917000	And we'll be all sitting here going, didn't we hear this before a couple years ago?
917000	920000	Actually, you are correct. They will be out there.
920000	931000	I do think that they'll actually be in the presentation because one of the rumors was supposed to be that Titan game from the X Infinity Ward guys, their new company.
931000	933000	Oh, the actual Titan game.
933000	934000	No, the actual Titan game.
934000	938000	When you say Titan, my mind goes to Horde House, Blizzard and all that.
938000	940000	And I think of the Project Titan that Blizzard's doing.
940000	942000	But no, it's not that.
942000	953000	I think that we can all agree though that no matter what Microsoft says, there is going to be a shit storm on the internet immediately following.
953000	957000	Absolutely, which is really interesting because I'm actually going to be out of town.
957000	960000	I'm not going to be able to watch it live or participate in the snark on Twitter.
960000	962000	I'm going to watch it live and I'll participate in the snark.
962000	964000	Of course you will.
964000	965000	You should live blog it for us.
965000	968000	And I already have my popcorn, so I'm all ready.
968000	969000	Alright.
969000	974000	I'm a little sad I'm going to be having to watch it late, but I'm going to be up in Reno.
974000	978000	I'm not getting up at 10am to watch this crap.
978000	980000	I'm busy.
980000	988000	So, I'll have to kind of wait and see it later and have to go rewind the snark over on Twitter.
988000	989000	Alright.
989000	991000	So, we'll see what happens.
991000	997000	I'm looking at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and I'm kind of curious what you guys think is going to happen.
997000	1002000	ActDef says, I'm betting on Xbox Power 3 or XCube.
1002000	1005000	It might be a little too close to GameCube.
1005000	1008000	ShadowNextGen says, Xbox Infinity makes sense.
1008000	1010000	Turn the infinity symbol right side up and what do you get?
1010000	1013000	The number 8, which can tie into Windows 8.
1013000	1019000	Here's my whole kind of like, hmm, with that though is that we have that news, was it this week or last week,
1019000	1024000	that there's going to move on to Windows 8.1, which is that Windows Blue they've been talking about,
1024000	1026000	which is going to be a free upgrade for Windows 8.
1026000	1033000	So, it's basically like fixing the problems people have with Windows 8 to try to get more people to buy it, essentially.
1033000	1035000	You know, like a free patch.
1035000	1038000	So, now it's going to be 8.1.
1038000	1039000	So, it's the band-aid.
1039000	1040000	I guess.
1040000	1041000	I don't know.
1041000	1045000	Not that I disagree with what ShadowNextGen's saying, but I'm just wondering how that's going to play into it.
1045000	1047000	Windows 8, it's just a service pack.
1047000	1048000	Windows 8 service pack one now.
1048000	1052000	Yeah, but they seem to be calling it much more than a service pack, right?
1052000	1054000	So, we'll see.
1054000	1056000	I thought they should call it the Texeract.
1056000	1058000	Why is that?
1058000	1065000	Because a tesseract is a fourth dimensional cube since they would have, if you were going by box to cube,
1065000	1068000	the next step up would be a tesseract.
1068000	1071000	But then again, I watch way too much Cosmos.
1071000	1073000	So, just ignore me.
1073000	1075000	Alright.
1075000	1076000	There you go.
1076000	1079000	Those are some of the chats from live.vognetwork.com.
1079000	1082000	Because, again, we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
1082000	1085000	And it is all about letting you guys have your voice in the show.
1085000	1088000	And I know a lot of you are going to have some reactions after Tuesday.
1088000	1090000	So, please, we want to win their fresh.
1090000	1091000	Email us.
1091000	1093000	Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com.
1093000	1095000	Or you can always tweet us at OLR.
1095000	1097000	And we're also on Facebook and Google Plus.
1097000	1100000	So, interact with us and we'll read your comments here on the show.
1100000	1104000	Let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you've been playing this week
1104000	1108000	while you wait for this next wave of game consoles to take off.
1108000	1109000	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1109000	1110000	How was your gaming week?
1110000	1117000	My gaming week was kind of less eventful just because I've been getting ready to leave.
1117000	1120000	I've played Ragnarok Online 2.
1120000	1122000	I'm definitely going to quit WoW.
1123000	1128000	It's just I'm trying to find a time to log on and finish up some stuff and give people some money
1128000	1131000	if anyone ever went on the Alliance Guild again.
1131000	1134000	For your money, I'll sign in to my paladin.
1134000	1136000	Give me a dollar.
1136000	1140000	I'm not giving – I have a lot of money on my Alliance account,
1140000	1144000	which makes me kind of want to transfer one of my tunes over.
1144000	1151000	But I've been playing some Ragnarok Online 2 and Gravity is doing this sort of drawing thing
1151000	1153000	where you can win a prize.
1153000	1157000	Your name is entered for every hour you're logged in, so there have been a lot of vendors,
1157000	1159000	a lot of vendors in game.
1159000	1164000	I've been doing my weekly Mass Effect 3.
1164000	1169000	I would call it my rant fest whilst playing.
1169000	1170000	I've been doing that.
1170000	1171000	A Let's Play.
1171000	1175000	That's going to come up later in the show, so it's a Let's Play basically.
1175000	1182000	No, it's more or less me just doing the MST3K thing with it and telling off characters
1182000	1185000	and calling Udina asshole and that type of thing.
1185000	1187000	Okay, so a Let's Bitch.
1187000	1191000	It's Mass Effect 3 Rocky Edition.
1191000	1192000	Okay.
1192000	1195000	All right, so I've been doing that.
1195000	1201000	I also bought Borderlands 2 because right now I think it's still on sale on Steam.
1201000	1211000	It went to some ridiculous price, like $13, so I went ahead and picked up Borderlands 2,
1211000	1217000	even if it's going to make me puke my brains out from motion sickness.
1217000	1219000	Dan had such a good time playing it.
1219000	1222000	Dan also got a new racing rig.
1222000	1223000	I saw those pictures on Facebook.
1223000	1224000	It looks sweet.
1224000	1227000	He's got three monitors in a little sit-down seat.
1227000	1229000	Well, he had the monitors already.
1229000	1236000	They're actually three TVs because he got the hookup at work.
1236000	1237000	Okay.
1237000	1242000	But his old rig, he had a fanatic stand and these chairs that he built out of the seats
1242000	1248000	from, what was it, a Honda Civic or something.
1248000	1254000	So he actually has an actual racing rig that he bought from some guy in Reno.
1254000	1258000	The guy came and delivered it, and it was pretty neat.
1258000	1260000	So he's got a lot of racing going on.
1260000	1269000	He's looking forward to Grid 2, and so I've been indirectly participating in his racing
1269000	1274000	addiction by watching him and commenting and going, ugh, that car sucks.
1274000	1278000	But that's really been the extent of my gaming.
1278000	1283000	No, I played something else, and for the life of me, I can't remember what it was, so just
1283000	1284000	forget it.
1284000	1285000	Oh, yeah, Off.
1285000	1287000	I was going to say, it must not have made a big impression.
1287000	1288000	What is Off?
1288000	1289000	I don't know if I've heard of this.
1289000	1295000	It's a very, very weird little RPG, especially now that I can play it windowed.
1295000	1302000	It's like you are sort of like controlling an avatar, and your avatar is called the Batter,
1302000	1304000	like a guy with a bat.
1304000	1310000	And you go around and do puzzles and talk to people, and it's bizarre.
1310000	1312000	I'll put it that way, but it's free.
1312000	1318000	It was done by, crap, I forgot the name, but the original version was in French, and it's
1318000	1320000	been translated.
1320000	1323000	And it's something that should be looked for.
1323000	1328000	I'll find a link for it for the chat room, where I downloaded the translation from.
1328000	1334000	It's a neat little game, plus also half of Tumblr loses their mind over it.
1334000	1335000	Of course.
1335000	1336000	Yeah.
1336000	1337000	I've been enjoying it.
1337000	1341000	Just like Tumblr loses their mind over the Yahoo overlords that are coming in next week,
1341000	1342000	apparently.
1342000	1343000	Oh my god.
1343000	1345000	I am so, ugh, don't even get me started.
1345000	1347000	But it's fun to get you started.
1347000	1350000	You're freaking out over no news, really.
1350000	1351000	Nothing.
1351000	1353000	They haven't done anything.
1353000	1357000	You're just, you know, yeah, Yahoo doesn't have the best track record, but still.
1357000	1362000	I think I made this comparison on Bobby Blackwell's show when we were doing the call at the end
1362000	1363000	of his show, as we always do.
1363000	1367000	But it's kind of like Grandma taking you to a One Direction concert.
1367000	1368000	That's what that buyout feels like.
1368000	1370000	Well, that's One Direction.
1371000	1372000	It's a British thing.
1372000	1375000	I thought you were up on all your Brit stuff.
1375000	1378000	I'm not up on things that suck.
1378000	1380000	So you do know what it is.
1380000	1381000	Alright.
1381000	1383000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1383000	1386000	I played a whole bunch of different things this week.
1386000	1388000	So, let's see.
1388000	1395000	Starting off this week, we did the VOG gaming night, Grand Theft Auto 3, or 3, Grand Theft
1395000	1397000	Auto 4 free play.
1397000	1401000	I promise I wanted to be there, but I drove to San Francisco to see Star Trek.
1401000	1403000	Did you play the game?
1403000	1405000	No.
1405000	1407000	Not yet.
1407000	1409000	So we just kind of hung out.
1409000	1411000	We were going to try to join other people's free mode games.
1411000	1414000	It was just a big combat fest, and we didn't really want to shoot each other, which is
1414000	1417000	kind of, you know, anti-Grand Theft Auto, but we were just messing around.
1417000	1422000	So we went to the swing set of evil, or death, or whatever you want to call it, and we're
1422000	1424000	launching cars out of that.
1424000	1426000	And that was kind of fun.
1426000	1428000	We messed around with that a little bit.
1428000	1431000	And then, let's see what else.
1431000	1434000	Oh, and for next week, I have no idea what we're going to play.
1434000	1438000	So, anyone has any suggestions on what you want to play?
1438000	1440000	That'd be fantastic.
1440000	1446000	And also, I'm thinking about maybe toying with the idea of changing the night from Thursday
1446000	1450000	to Friday, because I know it gets kind of late, especially when we're starting at 8
1450000	1452000	o'clock on the East Coast.
1452000	1454000	I mean, on Thursday night, it's a little odd.
1454000	1458000	But maybe Friday, we'll see.
1458000	1460000	Also have video capture equipment, finally.
1460000	1462000	I got an Elgato Game Capture HD.
1462000	1466000	Ooh, you have to tell me how that works, because I really want to get something for the living
1466000	1468000	room here to do that type of thing.
1468000	1472000	Yeah, it looks pretty simple, so I'll have to mess with that.
1472000	1476000	And then, okay, so back to the games.
1476000	1482000	So I had the urge this week to play Command & Conquer Red Alert, like the first one.
1482000	1488000	And so I was going to go buy it from Amazon, because they have their sale going.
1488000	1492000	And then I was doing some searching, and it's freeware.
1492000	1495000	So I downloaded it for free, which is fantastic.
1495000	1497000	That's the best price.
1497000	1501000	And so I installed it, had to add some different patches to it to get to work in Windows 7.
1501000	1505000	And the first thing I had to do, mod it, because that's what I do.
1505000	1507000	I play modded games.
1507000	1512000	So I messed with the rules I and I filed to mod kind of how I had it before.
1512000	1517000	I had a really cool setup back in the day when I was playing it with all these custom
1517000	1519000	units I made and stuff.
1519000	1521000	So I kind of remembered some of that and put it back in there.
1521000	1523000	So I played a skirmish game last night.
1523000	1526000	It took about two hours, just because I was toying with the computer.
1526000	1528000	I wasn't immediately going for the kill.
1528000	1531000	I was just letting them kind of live a little bit.
1531000	1533000	But it was pretty fun.
1533000	1534000	I had a lot of fun with it.
1534000	1536000	It still runs like shit, though, on my computer, which is weird,
1536000	1541000	because it's such an old game you'd think with the processor being so fast that it should
1541000	1545000	be able to run a little faster than it did, but whatever.
1545000	1547000	So I played that.
1547000	1551000	And then, since I can talk about it this week, Metro Last Light.
1551000	1553000	I played that last week.
1553000	1555000	And it's fantastic.
1555000	1558000	I was going to say, you gave it a very favorable review over at VOG Network.
1558000	1560000	Yeah, it's fantastic.
1560000	1562000	See, my laptop is not very...
1562000	1564000	I mean, the graphics card is not great.
1564000	1568000	I ran everything in that game on low visual settings, but I never noticed.
1568000	1570000	I mean, it looked just like the console version.
1570000	1575000	I mean, apparently it has really good visuals, but you have to have a pretty decent graphics card,
1575000	1576000	and I'm kind of limited.
1576000	1579000	I can't upgrade my graphics card in my laptop.
1579000	1581000	You weren't the only one that seemed to enjoy it.
1581000	1583000	I'm seeing a lot on the internet, a lot of good reviews of that game.
1583000	1589000	But yeah, it reminded me a lot of Bioshock Infinite, just with kind of the different story elements.
1589000	1592000	It's very linear.
1593000	1596000	Bioshock was very linear.
1596000	1600000	There's a little bit of like, okay, you can do this, you can do that differently.
1600000	1603000	You can do a lot of stealth in the game, which is kind of cool.
1603000	1611000	You can take out lights, and a lot of the lights thing plays into the stealth stuff.
1611000	1614000	So there's a mode that's pretty difficult.
1614000	1618000	You can actually play the whole game without killing anybody, except for the mutants.
1618000	1621000	You have to kill the mutants because they'll just charge right at you.
1621000	1623000	You can't walk past them.
1623000	1625000	But there's an achievement you get for doing that.
1625000	1628000	And I don't know, I just enjoyed it.
1628000	1629000	I enjoyed the storyline.
1629000	1630000	I haven't played 2033.
1630000	1634000	I have 2033, so I should probably check it out,
1634000	1639000	although now I've had the ending spoiled because they kind of give it away at the end of this game,
1639000	1640000	because it ties in with it.
1640000	1643000	But yeah, it was a really great game.
1643000	1647000	I'm glad I got to play it because I wasn't really familiar with the series at all,
1647000	1649000	and it's pretty awesome.
1649000	1651000	So definitely worth checking out.
1651000	1654000	And I know a lot of people might want to wait until a sale comes.
1654000	1659000	And if it's anything like the other Deep Silver games, it'll be deeply discounted pretty soon,
1659000	1663000	because they really knock the prices off their games pretty quick.
1663000	1668000	And just a quick plug, since you did bring up the review that you did for this game.
1668000	1670000	If you check out his review over at vognetwork.com,
1670000	1673000	and I noticed for the live listeners, Bobby put that in chat,
1673000	1676000	but it's really easy to find if you just go to vognetwork.com.
1676000	1679000	The really cool thing about the way the website is built over at VOG Network,
1679000	1682000	or the voice engaged network, is that you can actually do a response review.
1682000	1687000	So if you also like the game, or maybe you didn't like the game and you want to have your say on that,
1687000	1689000	you can actually write a response review.
1689000	1694000	And the way it's done is that we actually screen the reviews to make sure they're not trolly,
1694000	1696000	to make sure they are thought out,
1696000	1700000	to make sure they're worthy of posting right underneath the main review.
1700000	1704000	And we never judge that on opinion, whether you love it or hate it.
1704000	1707000	We just want to make sure it sounds like you've actually played it,
1707000	1709000	and that you're not just first.
1709000	1712000	It's not like a Metacritic thing where you're like, one, ten.
1712000	1714000	Exactly. It has to be a little more thought out than that.
1714000	1719000	So we will, of course, approve those, and you get your review right there,
1719000	1721000	right underneath the main review.
1721000	1725000	And it's pretty cool, and one of the things that makes our site really unique, which I like.
1725000	1728000	So you only have a limited amount of time to do that, though.
1728000	1731000	I don't remember what it is. Bobby, you'll have to remind me.
1731000	1733000	I think it's like two weeks or a month.
1733000	1737000	We do that on movies. I know a lot of you have been seeing Iron Man 3, Star Trek Into Darkness.
1737000	1740000	Both those movies are also reviewed on our site, and you can participate with that.
1740000	1743000	And then the other things I played on the Ouya.
1743000	1745000	I've been playing a lot of stuff on the Ouya.
1745000	1750000	I've actually been playing a lot of the Pingo puzzle poker.
1750000	1755000	It's like this cross between poker and bingo.
1755000	1758000	And I can't beat my high score, though.
1758000	1762000	And she keeps extending. They have a high score contest going on right now.
1762000	1763000	And she keeps extending it out.
1763000	1767000	It's now June 15th is when that expires, because there's not a lot of people participating.
1767000	1773000	But man, I have a 591,000 score that good luck anyone beating that.
1773000	1778000	Because I've been playing every day, and I can't beat that.
1778000	1780000	I got close. I got 491 the other day.
1780000	1783000	So I believe that. It's pretty fun.
1783000	1785000	I was trying some other games.
1785000	1791000	I've been doing a lot of these quick looks at different games on the Ouya.
1791000	1797000	And I've actually been posting quite a bit on my YouTube channel, which is just LokiOLR.
1797000	1805000	And I've been noticing a lot of problems with those analog dead zones.
1805000	1812000	I wasn't noticing it originally, but man, they're bad on those early controllers.
1812000	1813000	It's just not...
1813000	1817000	You try to turn diagonal, and your character slows down,
1817000	1821000	because it's like you're not pushing very far in the analog stick.
1821000	1826000	But I played this amazing frog or something like that.
1826000	1828000	And the volume on it...
1828000	1832000	They have these boomboxes in the game, and the audio is so fucking loud.
1832000	1833000	It's ridiculous.
1833000	1836000	I had to shut the game off. It's actually funny if you watch the video.
1836000	1839000	I shut it off because it was so goddamn loud on the game.
1839000	1844000	I had the volume on. The TV wasn't that loud, because I've been playing other games in it.
1844000	1847000	The audio of those boomboxes is just so fucking ridiculous.
1847000	1850000	I was like, I'm gonna try to smash this thing.
1850000	1851000	But it was kind of fun.
1851000	1853000	Some random comments from our chat room.
1853000	1854000	Shadownextgen agreeing with you.
1854000	1856000	Vector on Ouya is a lot of fun.
1856000	1859000	And Bobby is in chat clarifying something I brought up earlier.
1859000	1862000	You can actually respond to reviews at any time.
1862000	1867000	I made a mistake. I confused it with another feature of the site that technically is also open all the time.
1867000	1870000	It just doesn't give you rewards after a certain point on vognetwork.com.
1870000	1872000	But reviews? Always open.
1872000	1873000	So that's really cool.
1873000	1875000	So you can check that out whenever.
1875000	1876000	I know.
1876000	1881000	Well, our site is just so intricate and awesome that I forget things.
1881000	1882000	It's too complicated.
1882000	1883000	Nice save.
1883000	1884000	I need a user manual.
1884000	1885000	Nice save.
1885000	1886000	I need a user manual.
1886000	1888000	Anything else for your gaming week, Logie?
1888000	1892000	I think that's it for this week.
1892000	1901000	But yeah, seriously though, there's a topic on the gaming section on the VoG forums for the gaming night stuff.
1901000	1902000	Let me know what games you guys want to play.
1902000	1904000	It doesn't have to be on Xbox 360.
1904000	1907000	It's just it's been that way for the last couple times.
1907000	1910000	PC, PS3, whatever you guys have.
1910000	1911000	Whatever you want to play.
1911000	1917000	You know, obviously pick a game or consider games that allow a lot of people to play.
1917000	1918000	Like Saints Row the third multiplayer.
1918000	1920000	Not going to work because it's only two people.
1920000	1923000	It'd be fun, but you just can't really do that.
1923000	1925000	So something that is preferably free.
1925000	1929000	Like Team Fortress 2 was one that I thought of because I haven't played that and it's free.
1930000	1934000	Going into my gaming week, I actually got to that point where I was kind of bored.
1934000	1937000	So I was going through random games on Steam and I even went into Team Fortress 2.
1937000	1942000	But I only did like single player stuff like tutorials and bots and things on my own.
1942000	1945000	But yeah, I would actually love to try Team Fortress 2.
1945000	1950000	Kind of like a I think we should have a noob night on Team Fortress 2.
1950000	1953000	Like no shame and like people that are a little more experienced.
1953000	1956000	Like I know Act F actually plays a little bit like they could be the coaches.
1956000	1960000	So we can have like a no shame noob night on Team Fortress 2 I think would be a lot of fun.
1960000	1964000	Because I would like to see something like that for League of Legends and Dota.
1964000	1968000	I need a friendly warm environment to help me learn some of those games.
1968000	1972000	As opposed to the mean assholes that make up a lot of the League of Legends community.
1972000	1974000	That'd be my mode.
1974000	1976000	You know one of the games I've been looking at.
1976000	1978000	Like one of the sale things that they have on Amazon right now.
1978000	1981000	Speaking of games to get into and stuff.
1981000	1987000	They have Civ 5 Gold with some other thing on there.
1987000	1991000	And then XCOM for like 20 bucks.
1991000	1995000	Pull the trigger. It's great. Civ 5 is great.
1995000	1997000	I think Civ 4 is also in there.
1997000	1999000	Oh nice. Well Civ 4 was a great game too.
1999000	2001000	But Civ 5 is awesome.
2001000	2006000	And that would also be a game that would make a great night sometime.
2006000	2010000	That is going to have to be an OLR weekend game.
2010000	2012000	Anyway.
2012000	2015000	Going into other games I've been playing this week.
2015000	2020000	A lot of the Warcraft stuff is starting to die down a little bit as all my friends are leaving.
2020000	2022000	I'm still playing it now and again.
2022000	2024000	But mostly just log in.
2024000	2027000	Do a daily dungeon and a daily PVP.
2027000	2029000	And then that's about it for right now.
2029000	2034000	But with the patch 5.3 coming soon I imagine I'll be playing more World of Warcraft.
2034000	2036000	But some of the games I've been checking out in the interim.
2036000	2039000	As I mentioned before I did check out Team Fortress 2.
2039000	2042000	I actually went into Star Trek Online for a little bit.
2042000	2045000	I think seeing the movie kind of put me in a mood where I'm like,
2045000	2047000	I need to check out Star Trek Online again.
2047000	2049000	It's been a long time since I played it.
2049000	2053000	And you know it's free to play online through Steam so it's very easy to download and set up.
2053000	2057000	I had some weird issues just trying to launch the game.
2057000	2061000	Like I sat there on a loading screen for, I kid you not, five minutes.
2061000	2062000	Timed it.
2062000	2064000	The game's really gone to crap since they made it free to play.
2064000	2065000	Really? That's too bad.
2065000	2067000	You know I logged in and I was playing for a little bit.
2067000	2069000	I had fun with the character creation.
2069000	2072000	Kind of making a little guy that...
2072000	2075000	I want to say it looks like me but it ended up looking like Riker.
2075000	2078000	But I've also been told that I look like Riker with red hair.
2078000	2080000	So I don't know what to tell you.
2080000	2081000	I don't see it.
2081000	2082000	I think it's the beard.
2082000	2083000	It must be the beard.
2083000	2085000	But yeah, whatever.
2085000	2089000	So I made my guy and I had fun doing the little tutorial.
2089000	2091000	But I had to go somewhere else so I didn't get to play.
2091000	2094000	I didn't get to actually interact with other people so that was that.
2094000	2099000	But they changed the beginning of the game from what I remember.
2099000	2102000	Because I remember the beginning of the game used to be narrated by Zachary Quinto.
2102000	2104000	And now they have Leonard Nimoy doing it.
2104000	2106000	That was interesting.
2106000	2112000	Well no, the beginning was always narrated by Leonard Nimoy.
2112000	2115000	Quinto does the tutorial battle.
2115000	2118000	He's the EMH.
2118000	2119000	Oh, okay.
2119000	2120000	Oh, okay.
2120000	2121000	Okay.
2121000	2122000	Alright, got it.
2122000	2123000	Yeah.
2123000	2125000	But they changed so much and it's not fun anymore.
2125000	2126000	Why is that?
2126000	2127000	Or what is...
2127000	2129000	I don't know enough about the game just from playing the tutorial.
2129000	2131000	They changed the skill trees.
2131000	2137000	Like they completely redid the skill setup for how you assign and do your points and
2137000	2141000	your various weapons that you can pick up for your different classes.
2142000	2149000	Because my normal class is an engineer and I always do the, what are they called, the
2149000	2152000	fast ships, the little small fast ships.
2152000	2158000	But every time I would log in, my skills would be completely reset.
2158000	2160000	So I'd have to reassign all of my skills.
2160000	2162000	And then I'd change it a third time.
2162000	2166000	So I was like, you know what, this isn't even worth it to me to have to sit and go through.
2166000	2169000	Because keep in mind, my character right now is a Rear Admiral.
2170000	2173000	And it just took forever to get everything.
2173000	2178000	And I also had like the middle level account because I had stopped paying my subscription,
2178000	2180000	but I had been paying a subscription.
2180000	2186000	So it was just, all I did last time I played was hang out at Deep Space Nine and play Dabo.
2186000	2188000	Seriously, that's all I did.
2188000	2193000	Tigerclaw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com reminding us, Star Trek Online has a new DLC
2193000	2195000	pack called Legacy of Romulus.
2195000	2196000	Yes, I did notice that.
2196000	2198000	It's all over the splash screens when you log into the game.
2199000	2205000	Some other folks in chat, a variety of people talking about the Star Trek game that just came out on 360 PS3
2205000	2207000	and the negative reception it's getting.
2207000	2211000	I seen Shadow Next Gen in chat saying, stay away, far, far away.
2211000	2213000	So apparently it's not good.
2213000	2218000	That's too bad because I remember they pushed it back to tie in with the new movie as opposed to the last Blu-Ray.
2218000	2220000	So, uh oh.
2221000	2224000	Let's see, other stuff I played this week.
2224000	2227000	Believe it or not, I went back to Diablo 3 and played quite a bit of that.
2227000	2231000	You guys might remember I picked it up again very randomly a couple months ago,
2231000	2233000	but then I kind of like fell off the wagon and didn't play for a bit.
2233000	2242000	Well, I read somewhere they were doing a 25% increased XP and magic gold find weekend
2242000	2245000	because this is the one year anniversary of Diablo 3 coming out.
2245000	2247000	So I was like, what the hell, I'll go take a look.
2247000	2251000	And I actually played enough, I finally beat the damn game.
2251000	2254000	A year later, finally beat Diablo 3.
2254000	2258000	I killed Diablo and I'll tell you what, you'll have to ask Alan about this,
2258000	2264000	but I had so much rage during that Diablo fight because the game is not that hard.
2264000	2266000	Like it's just click, click, kill, kill, kill.
2266000	2271000	You know, especially if you're finding the good items and using the auction house, not real money.
2271000	2275000	I don't use real money, but I use the gold auction house to find good deals on gear and stuff.
2275000	2283000	And I had some really good gear, but when I got to the last act, when I got to the second half of Act 4,
2283000	2286000	I can't even start a kick in my ass. I got a lot harder.
2286000	2290000	And when I finally got to the Diablo fight, I think I had to fight him like seven times before I got it.
2290000	2294000	It was as intricate as a raid fight in World of Warcraft.
2294000	2300000	Like you have to, you know, don't stand in the black, watch out for his beam that's going to go clockwise
2300000	2302000	and make sure when the shadow does the attack it doesn't hit you.
2302000	2304000	Like you have to be watching for all this stuff.
2304000	2306000	So it was a very unforgiving fight.
2306000	2310000	So yeah, but I beat him. I didn't need any help.
2310000	2317000	So I finally, and you guys might remember, I said I wanted to play Diablo 3 once by myself, no people helping me,
2317000	2321000	which a couple of people on my friends list got a little butthurt that I didn't want to play Diablo 3 with them.
2321000	2325000	But I said a long time ago I was going to do that and I was going to play it through
2325000	2328000	because one of my friends was like, let me help you kill Diablo. Let me help you kill Diablo.
2328000	2333000	And I'm like, no. But I did it.
2333000	2336000	So now I'm going to explore some of the multiplayer stuff.
2336000	2340000	That's the next thing I want to do in Diablo and move on to the nightmare difficulty or whatever.
2340000	2345000	Because the one negative I will say with that is that Diablo 3 kind of has a shitty ending.
2345000	2349000	Like you get the little full motion video movie, which I guess is cool and so forth.
2349000	2353000	And then it's like, well, you beat it on this difficulty. Now play again.
2353000	2355000	Doo doo doo doo doo doo.
2355000	2356000	Was it worth the blood pact?
2356000	2357000	Huh?
2357000	2358000	Was it worth the blood pact?
2358000	2364000	Well, yeah, because I played enough WoW and I got Diablo 3 for free. So it's hard to bitch.
2365000	2370000	And to be fair, maybe the ending is like it gets better when you play it on the higher difficulties.
2370000	2373000	Because you can play it through like four different difficulties, right? And then hardcore.
2373000	2376000	So, you know, I don't know.
2376000	2382000	But anyway, I thought because I never beat games, I thought y'all could appreciate I did finally, finally beat Diablo 3.
2382000	2383000	Hooray.
2383000	2385000	And that was pretty much my gaming week.
2385000	2390000	So, quick housekeeping. We may not have a show next week.
2390000	2394000	In fact, I'm going to say right now it's very likely we will not have a show next week.
2394000	2397000	Stay tuned to Twitter for updates though. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2397000	2405000	We will let you know mid-week because we do want to do something about the Xbox thing on Tuesday and getting some immediate reactions to that.
2405000	2410000	I do want to plug our Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Orange Radio.
2410000	2412000	And of course, Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2412000	2419000	And also, I thought we would take an opportunity and plug some of the Twitch TV live streaming we've been doing.
2419000	2423000	I've been doing it all on the main O-L-R channel, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
2423000	2425000	And I'm going to try to convince Loki to move there.
2425000	2427000	That's fine. I only did it once.
2427000	2429000	Right now, you're streaming where?
2429000	2432000	I think it's all – it's loki O-L-R on Twitch.
2432000	2436000	But now, Jamie, you do some more personal projects where you're doing sketching and things like that.
2436000	2438000	So, you do have your own Twitch channel for that. Where's that at?
2438000	2444000	It's kurotsubasa, K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.
2445000	2450000	And – but I'm actually thinking about making an actual live stream account just for the drawing.
2450000	2451000	Nice.
2451000	2454000	Because Twitch is more for gaming.
2454000	2463000	And to be honest though, I'm probably going to be taking a little bit of a break from doing the hardcore projects because I finally, finally finished my FemShep project.
2463000	2466000	How many FemShep drawings did you end up doing?
2466000	2467000	Twenty-two.
2467000	2468000	Twenty-two. Wow.
2468000	2469000	Two of them were mine.
2470000	2478000	But yeah, they're all done and they are on Mass Effecting, my Tumblr for all things Mass Effect.
2478000	2481000	Well, then maybe we'll have to get your gaming stuff on the O-L-R channel as well.
2481000	2486000	And then we'll have all those subscribers still built in from the days we used to do the show over there.
2486000	2487000	That'd be nice.
2487000	2488000	That'd be nice. All right.
2488000	2496000	But for now, let's – because when we're off a week, that's – the live streaming is a really good way to kind of keep tabs on us during the week.
2496000	2503000	We do make sure that we're streaming when there is not other programming at the Voice Geeks Network, which we always try to promote the other great independent shows.
2503000	2510000	Everything from TVs to movies to anime to British stuff to American stuff to Australian stuff.
2510000	2512000	It's all at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
2512000	2518000	Let's get into gaming news, of which there was a surprising amount of it this week.
2518000	2522000	Although I guess we are getting in those weeks leading up to E3, so more and more is going to come up.
2522000	2524000	Only a couple weeks away, so.
2524000	2525000	All right, Loki.
2525000	2531000	So EA shockingly announced that they are putting an end to their online pass program.
2531000	2541000	And basically saying, yes, we are discontinuing online pass and none of our EA titles will feature – or include that feature.
2541000	2543000	Ha, feature. That's funny.
2543000	2544000	Yeah, feature.
2544000	2552000	It's as many players didn't respond to the format and, you know, we've listened to feedback and decided to do away with it moving forward.
2553000	2561000	Which makes me think what the hell is coming up that we don't know about that's going to take the place of this because –
2561000	2567000	I think a lot of people had that reaction as there's that initial celebration, the Kermit flail, yay!
2567000	2572000	The EA got rid of the online pass, like they realized it was a really off-putting idea.
2572000	2576000	But then it's like, wait a minute, this can only get worse.
2577000	2581000	EA is not coming to go, hey guys, we were wrong, sorry.
2581000	2584000	Hey, hey, you know that SimCity, we should have made it offline.
2584000	2586000	Here's a patch to make it offline.
2586000	2587000	They're not going to do that.
2587000	2592000	It's going to have something that's being done by the console manufacturer to take the place of this.
2592000	2598000	The money is going to come from somewhere and I wonder – well, even if it's not necessarily that whole thing that it's –
2598000	2599000	Microtransactions?
2599000	2601000	I think it's increased DLC.
2601000	2606000	I think that's where they're going to make – and remember this point because I'm going to bring it up again later in the show.
2606000	2608000	We get into something else involving EA.
2608000	2613000	But I think the whole DLC and the microtransactions is how they're going to make up the money.
2613000	2618000	I think you're going to see more games that really rely on that to make their – why not?
2618000	2624000	It works for Facebook and free-to-play games and a lot of companies unfortunately are moving into that dangerous space where it's like,
2625000	2632000	oh, well, people – the consumer wants to play a Facebook game and they want to buy all these little free tools and energy packs.
2632000	2634000	They got rid of that. They got out of that though.
2634000	2640000	And I don't know. There's a part of me that's like that's got to be something.
2640000	2644000	I don't doubt that they're going to charge you $60 for a game and have a bunch of crappy DLC for it.
2644000	2647000	Or some good DLC, but probably a lot of crappy DLC.
2647000	2653000	Do you think that possibly the relationship with GameStop came into this?
2653000	2657000	Do you think maybe GameStop maybe choked a bitch, so to speak?
2657000	2665000	And GameStop might have been like, you know, our retail people don't really push your games because you don't get the same value out of that.
2665000	2669000	And we kind of like to push the 2K sports games that don't have the online passes.
2669000	2675000	I don't even know if that would have really – I think that maybe they just found that they weren't making a whole ton of money off of it.
2675000	2679000	Maybe they think that their games are so awesome that people are just buying them new anyways.
2680000	2687000	Although, I don't know. It's just – it's weird. I don't know really what they would be thinking.
2687000	2695000	But do I think other publishers are going to follow suit because, you know, hey, EA did it and so everybody else started doing it? No.
2695000	2699000	I mean, if you already think about it, you have one less studio that's going to be doing that.
2699000	2707000	Deep Silver not following suit with like THQ's decision to do online passes for their games, so you're not going to see it through them.
2707000	2714000	I don't think Take-Two's doing that for WWE 2K14, so you're not going to have that happening.
2714000	2719000	Really, the only companies left would be Ubisoft.
2719000	2723000	Well, Warner Games, they still might do that.
2723000	2733000	But, you know, really their next big game coming out is, you know, Batman Arkham Origins, which doesn't have an online component.
2733000	2743000	But last time with Arkham Asylum, they had the whole Catwoman DLC, which was the sort of online pass, pre-order bonus, whatever you want to call it.
2745000	2753000	And then, so yeah, Ubisoft and Sony, really, Sony first party would be the, you know, the other ones that have that in there.
2755000	2759000	Dark Sakura, what do you think about the whole EA getting rid of the online pass?
2759000	2768000	I think it's a, I mean, a smart move for one thing, but I think that they're going to replace it with something more nefarious.
2768000	2774000	I trust EA as far as I can pick up their entire headquarter building and push it.
2774000	2783000	Well, I think this is a good excuse to check in with the listeners here for a minute, and I think we're going to do a live poll.
2783000	2784000	How's that sound?
2784000	2793000	Alright, we're going to go to vognetwork.com, and specifically live.vognetwork.com, and we're going to ask our question of the live listeners.
2793000	2797000	And tonight's question is, why did EA get rid of the online pass?
2797000	2801000	And here's some of the options collected from what the hosts have said so far.
2801000	2806000	They are truly trying to look less evil. There's something about the new consoles.
2806000	2813000	They're going to rely on increased DLC. GameStop put them in a chokehold, or something else.
2813000	2821000	You can vote now. Register participants at live.vognetwork.com will see the poll up there on the site and can vote right now.
2821000	2827000	And you'll see that under the chat box at live.vognetwork.com. We'll go over those results there in just a minute.
2827000	2832000	The cool thing is that once you vote, you can actually see the results come in live.
2832000	2838000	And so far, everybody is saying there's something about the new consoles, dot, dot, dot.
2838000	2846000	But see, they've already talked about the PlayStation 4, and they've said that there's nothing preventing used games.
2846000	2851000	So I don't know if there is going to be anything with new consoles.
2851000	2856000	Maybe they just decided, hey, you know what? We're just not making a ton of money off of this.
2856000	2862000	Although, I thought they said they were making quite a bit of money. So why would you just get rid of money, or give up on that?
2862000	2868000	Exactly. I mean, is it really that much of a trying to save face after what happened with SimCity? I don't...
2868000	2876000	Because people are kind of expecting that. Anyways, maybe... I don't know. I don't really know what their thought process could be.
2876000	2879000	I guess we'll find out. We're definitely not going to find out on Tuesday.
2879000	2883000	They're not going to say, hey, by the way, we're going to have a feature that's going to prevent you from buying used games.
2883000	2889000	Yeah, the negative stuff, or anything that can be perceived as negative, that's not coming out on Tuesday.
2889000	2895000	They're not going to come out on stage and say, oh yeah, this Xbox has to always be online, or you'll get kicked off.
2895000	2899000	That's not something they would ever say. That's something that will have to get yanked out of them.
2899000	2903000	I think it would be cool if they did address all those, like if they had actual responses that were positive.
2903000	2909000	Like, it's not always online. We've heard your worries, and it's not.
2909000	2915000	All the guy talking, all the talking head would have to do is get up there and say, you know,
2915000	2920000	and don't worry, if I lose my internet connection, I can still play the game.
2920000	2923000	So, stop tweeting about it. You know, or just make a little joke about it.
2923000	2927000	Like, that's all they would need to do. And everybody could laugh it off.
2927000	2931000	Like an old sitcom at the end. Anyhow.
2931000	2934000	Alright, let's see. I'm going to check the results here.
2934000	2938000	Still 58% of the vote. There's something about the new consoles.
2938000	2942000	No votes for games? Stop putting them in a chokehold, though. People don't think that seems to be it.
2942000	2948000	So, a large amount of people as well. 30%. They're going to rely on increased DLC.
2948000	2952000	About 8% right now saying they are truly trying to look less evil.
2952000	2955000	So, 8% giving them the benefit of the doubt there.
2955000	2959000	So, we'll see. I'll check in with that poll one more time after this story.
2959000	2962000	Give you guys a last chance to vote there at live.vognetwork.com.
2962000	2965000	This is getting a little bit of controversy this week.
2965000	2968000	This story that's going around about a game that isn't even out here in America,
2968000	2970000	but a lot of people here have an opinion on it.
2970000	2976000	The game is in Japan only. Nintendo of Japan makes this series called Tomodachi Collection New Life.
2976000	2978000	This is a game that's on the 3DS.
2978000	2985000	And from my understanding of the game, I'm not going to confess to know a whole lot about this game,
2985000	2990000	but it's kind of Nintendo's answer to the Sims slash Animal Crossing.
2990000	2995000	And it uses Miis and it's one of those life simulation type of games.
2995000	2999000	Well, apparently there is a glitch in the game.
2999000	3006000	And according to some people in Japan, what happens with the glitch is that the glitch enables same sex marriages to appear.
3006000	3010000	And what you do, you bring your Miis over to the 3DS using the Miis transfer tool,
3010000	3018000	and somehow this glitch will allow your character to bathe with characters of the same gender,
3018000	3028000	make babies, defy the laws of science and everything, and raise babies and all that stuff with the whole same gender.
3028000	3034000	And obviously, places like Tumblr are very, and the story actually says this,
3034000	3038000	Hey, it's true though, places like Tumblr and some of the fan sites are very happy about this,
3038000	3042000	and posting their pictures of their happy little gay family and so forth.
3042000	3050000	And you know, obviously as a gay guy myself, I like to see a lot of this stuff that's positive in games.
3050000	3054000	And I love the way The Sims does it. The Sims is a great model.
3054000	3059000	It's like one of those games where it's like, you know, The Sims just will like whatever they like.
3059000	3064000	Whatever you want them to like. There's just no rules or things like that.
3064000	3071000	But in this game it's unfortunately unintended, and they're going to patch it out.
3071000	3078000	The patch in the near future will fix some other bugs that happen because of the same sex marriages.
3078000	3082000	Because the same sex marriages will lead to the inability to boot up the game,
3082000	3088000	the inability to save, getting a notice on home menus notification that a child will be sent on a journey,
3088000	3092000	but no actual message is there. That's clearly something in the game that I don't know much about,
3092000	3094000	because I don't know the series very well.
3094000	3095000	But a lot of people...
3095000	3097000	Since they're taking the Republican route, you know.
3097000	3100000	Well, here's the thing. There's a lot of people out there that are like,
3100000	3105000	and you know the way games journalism works where it's copy paste, copy paste,
3105000	3111000	but make the headline more sensationalist each time is that Nintendo bans same sex marriage from their game.
3111000	3113000	You know, or something. It's...
3113000	3122000	Okay, maybe the way this really is is that Nintendo didn't plan to put same sex marriage in their game.
3122000	3127000	It ended up there anyway through a bug, which will also cause save files to corrupt and so forth,
3127000	3129000	so they've got to do something about it.
3129000	3133000	You know, I don't think they're necessarily trying to patch out the gay marriage,
3133000	3136000	but that wasn't supposed to be there in the first place.
3136000	3138000	So I'm not as upset about this as you might think.
3138000	3141000	I mean, again, I'm gay myself and I like to see this stuff in games,
3141000	3147000	but I also realize a lot of Japanese games don't have gay marriage stuff in their games.
3147000	3152000	Final Fantasy XI, you could marry in that game, but they didn't do same gender weddings.
3152000	3155000	It was something they were thinking about or whatever, but they never did it.
3155000	3157000	I was like that for Ragnarok Online.
3157000	3160000	Did they do same genders in Ragnarok?
3160000	3164000	Yeah, they did. You had like marriage skills.
3164000	3167000	Like if you married your character, you could teleport to wherever your character was
3167000	3170000	or do like healing stuff.
3170000	3174000	But they didn't have it to where it would be same gendered,
3174000	3181000	and people who took private servers actually had to modify some of the programming in the game to enable it.
3181000	3183000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says,
3183000	3189000	From what I read of the story, the fix is only for the problems with the side effects caused by the glitch.
3189000	3192000	And that would be a great way to kind of resolve this scenario,
3192000	3195000	so that way it's like, okay, if people kind of figured out how to work the system
3195000	3197000	and get two guys in there, then whatever.
3197000	3200000	And I think that's a good way to do it.
3200000	3204000	And I think we are headed in the right direction, folks, culturally.
3204000	3209000	Like I look at games like Mass Effect, and yes, I know here I am bringing up that game again,
3209000	3215000	but guys, it's done so well in that series that there's a reason why I really love Mass Effect.
3215000	3217000	And games like The Sims and other games.
3217000	3220000	And you look at what's happening culturally is that, what did we have?
3220000	3227000	Three states that went for same-sex marriage in the past, what, two weeks or something like that?
3227000	3230000	Like, you know, the times are changing.
3230000	3237000	And, you know, eventually this is something that when the culture changes,
3237000	3242000	the games that are commentary on culture, such as a game like Tomodachi Collection,
3242000	3245000	will update to reflect that as well.
3245000	3249000	But, you know, for right now, I don't believe gay marriage is legal in Japan,
3249000	3253000	so it's probably why they didn't think to really put it in there as a fully fleshed out thing,
3253000	3258000	and why it is still kind of a bug that the two guys actually make the baby.
3258000	3264000	Which, you know, you would, obviously is not biologically possible,
3264000	3268000	although certainly there are many, many, many, many other ways for gay couples,
3268000	3274000	both male and female, to adopt a baby or have a surrogate or whatever to do that.
3274000	3277000	You do know science is working on that, right?
3277000	3282000	I wouldn't doubt it, and there was the whole pregnant man thing a while ago, but that's, you know-
3282000	3284000	Biolog- physically.
3284000	3285000	Right.
3285000	3286000	Female parts.
3286000	3287000	Right.
3287000	3288000	And a dude.
3288000	3289000	Right. Biologically.
3289000	3290000	Yes.
3290000	3298000	But they actually are working on using cloning technology so that two people of the same gender can have a child together.
3298000	3299000	Mm-hmm.
3299000	3301000	So, just kidding. Science?
3301000	3306000	So, I think generally, culturally, and I'm not trying to get too political on this show,
3306000	3309000	but obviously, you know, it's an issue that's kind of important to me.
3309000	3314000	It's one of those things where it's like, you know, it's more and more becoming not a big fucking deal,
3314000	3318000	and that's really what this should be, is it's not a big fucking deal
3318000	3322000	if two guys want to do something that doesn't affect your life whatsoever, you know what I mean?
3322000	3324000	It's just, you know.
3324000	3327000	Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox.
3327000	3330000	So, what do you think, DarkSakura, about this Tomodachi collection?
3330000	3336000	I think people are just, I think, unfortunately, the sensationalism of certain gaming websites and so forth
3336000	3339000	tended to make this story a bigger deal than it is,
3339000	3342000	but I think certainly there's got to be Nintendo kind of looking at this going,
3342000	3346000	oh, well, I guess if people are going to have these tumblers and so forth about it,
3346000	3349000	maybe this is something we should have thought of putting into their first place.
3349000	3351000	Anna, what do you think, Jamie?
3351000	3355000	Uh, I think it should have been there from the get-go.
3355000	3356000	Mm-hmm.
3356000	3360000	And if it's possible, I mean, clearly the glitch is causing some problems,
3360000	3363000	and I have no problem with them fixing those effects of the glitch,
3363000	3367000	but I would want them to see them leave in the option, actually even make it,
3367000	3371000	if they could incorporate some way to make that a regular feature in the game,
3371000	3377000	instead of just it being a glitch, and using that to fix the problems,
3377000	3379000	then that would be the way I would go.
3379000	3383000	And I would also request that they actually bring this game over to America,
3383000	3388000	so I can feel like I know what the fuck I'm talking about with this game,
3388000	3390000	because I'm going to be honest, I don't.
3390000	3393000	I can only really go off of screenshots and little YouTubes
3393000	3396000	and things I see of the game and my assumptions.
3396000	3397000	I would play it.
3397000	3400000	Yeah, I'd like to know a little more about what this game is in the first place.
3400000	3405000	Well, Tomogachi means friend, so it's buddy game.
3405000	3406000	All right.
3406000	3407000	All right, well, let's move on.
3407000	3409000	Oh, quickly, I'm going to close out the poll here.
3409000	3411000	Here's the final results of our poll.
3411000	3414000	The winner, why did EA get rid of the online pass?
3414000	3416000	57% of the vote.
3416000	3419000	There's something about the new consoles.
3419000	3422000	Second place, they're going to rely on increased DLC.
3422000	3423000	So there you go.
3423000	3425000	Those are the results of the live poll.
3425000	3427000	Thank you guys for voting at live.vognetwork.com.
3427000	3430000	Let's move on to the next story, DarkSakura.
3430000	3436000	In other news, now, this is probably why I've had Sega on the brain for a little while,
3436000	3442000	is Sega is, well, we've always known that Sega's been in bed with Nintendo.
3442000	3446000	We have no idea what they're doing in this bed, but they're doing stuff.
3446000	3455000	In this case, Sega has announced that they are in an exclusive partnership with Nintendo of America.
3455000	3461000	They are gay married to Nintendo, having clone babies in the form of a hedgehog.
3462000	3469000	Basically, Nintendo consoles are going to be exclusive for the next three Sonic the Hedgehog titles.
3469000	3474000	And they put out the announcement via Nintendo Direct during the week.
3474000	3480000	And they've only put out the names of the first two titles.
3480000	3486000	The third one is still to be announced, but these are Wii U and 3DS.
3486000	3492000	They're saying that it would be the ideal platform, that's a quote, to showcase Sonic.
3492000	3496000	Of course, though, since people aren't buying Wii U's,
3496000	3502000	Sega is once again showing that their business sense is kind of in the US.
3502000	3509000	And this is Sega of America and Sega Europe. I didn't see the official Sega of Japan.
3509000	3516000	Is this really a big deal, though? Because, I mean, Sonic games, not known for their quality these days so much.
3516000	3521000	They've had several Sonic games that have been exclusive to the Nintendo platform.
3521000	3523000	Sonic Colors, Sonic and the Secret Rings.
3523000	3527000	Mario and Sonic in the Olympics, which sells really well. Those games sell very well.
3527000	3528000	Yeah.
3528000	3529000	Yeah.
3529000	3533000	Which they're doing another, which is one of those three games they're doing, which makes sense.
3533000	3537000	But yeah, but that also, it sold well because the Wii sold well, right?
3538000	3540000	Yeah, definitely.
3540000	3542000	But the Wii U is not.
3543000	3546000	Well, that's going to suck for Sega then, I guess.
3548000	3553000	Because Sega's really had, especially Sega of America, had a great track record.
3553000	3559000	I wish they'd come out and said it's going to be Phantasy Star Online 2 that's going to be on the Wii U.
3559000	3564000	That would have given me something to get really excited about, which I'm surprised something like that isn't happening.
3564000	3566000	Well, you never know. E3 might be interesting.
3566000	3569000	Speaking of which, Rob, you need to play that with me on PC.
3569000	3571000	Is there an English patch yet for that?
3571000	3575000	Yeah, it's mostly English. It's English enough that you could be able to play it.
3575000	3577000	I might have to do that. We'll see.
3577000	3580000	It's actually super fun. It's exactly like the last one, so it's good.
3580000	3584000	Shadow Next Gen in our chat room with an interesting perspective saying,
3584000	3592000	Rob, with Nintendo helping to work on Sonic now though, maybe it will have that magic Nintendo polish that a lot of first party Nintendo titles have.
3593000	3597000	Could Nintendo's involvement make this sweeter?
3597000	3602000	And actually I do have to make a slight rebuttal, which I've said in the chat room.
3602000	3604000	Sonic Generations was pretty damn good.
3604000	3605000	Okay, fair enough.
3605000	3608000	But it was also out on multiple platforms.
3608000	3612000	And I got it on PC. It's fun on PC.
3612000	3618000	So I don't think it's going to make a difference. It just has to not be a turd of a game.
3618000	3623000	You know, like, what was the last really big turd in the Sonic franchise?
3623000	3628000	Sonic Adventure 2? No, Sonic Adventure 2 was okay. The first Sonic Adventure was good.
3628000	3629000	Sonic 4.
3629000	3630000	Sonic 4.
3630000	3631000	Yeah.
3631000	3632000	It was a huge turd.
3632000	3633000	Yeah.
3633000	3640000	It didn't even do much in the way of being fun. It just wasn't.
3641000	3650000	Tigerclaw theorizes in our chat room, what if part of the deal with Sega was that one of the Nintendo characters makes a cameo somewhere in the new Sonic game?
3650000	3651000	Oh boy.
3651000	3653000	Do you think that plumber can run that fast?
3653000	3657000	Anything's possible. Anything's possible.
3657000	3662000	Alright, so we will see what happens with this partnership.
3662000	3665000	Some other stuff coming out of the Nintendo Direct though. Loki?
3665000	3674000	Yeah, they finally announced a date for Wonderful 101, which is on September 15th in North America and August 23rd in Europe.
3674000	3678000	And that's all they said about it. So fantastic.
3678000	3683000	Also, Super Luigi U, the DLC is arriving on the 20th of June.
3683000	3693000	And then if you don't want to get it as DLC, you can pay an extra $10 and get a standalone disc, which is coming out August 25th.
3693000	3698000	I think the reason they're doing that is just to say, hey look, we have games coming out for the Wii U.
3698000	3702000	Because I don't know why else it would do that.
3702000	3709000	I kind of figured they would do that later on when they do a game of the year edition of New Super Mario Brothers with New Luigi U.
3709000	3713000	Because again, not every household in America is online.
3713000	3718000	Granted, if you're not online but you have a Wii U, I'm not sure how that works.
3718000	3725000	You must live in a real remote part of the US or something, but I think there's enough people without online that justify it.
3725000	3730000	Also, the Wii U could be in a kid's bedroom, which maybe doesn't have online or something, you know?
3730000	3735000	I guess. But they're putting it out, so I guess that's kind of cool.
3735000	3740000	And then last but not least, this is kind of neat because I'm not going to E3.
3740000	3745000	So you get to play unreleased Wii U games at Best Buy during E3.
3745000	3748000	They're going to have demo kiosks at over 100 locations.
3748000	3751000	And I guess it's going to be happening starting June 9th.
3751000	3753000	And no idea what games are going to be there.
3753000	3761000	I think, I want to say that the Mario and Sonic at the Olympics is going to be there and New Luigi U.
3761000	3765000	And then, don't know about the other stuff.
3765000	3767000	But they're going to have some games there.
3767000	3772000	So I actually probably will go check that out just because I don't get to go to E3.
3772000	3776000	Very interesting how Nintendo is really changing up the E3 strategy this year.
3776000	3781000	I mean, granted, we had a couple years ago, and I think this still happens to some extent,
3781000	3788000	Microsoft, I remember one year, went very big on bringing E3 home where you could download all the demos and so forth.
3788000	3792000	I really wish they would do that. That was awesome. That was in 2006.
3792000	3798000	And it was fantastic because it's like, hey, we just showed you this awesome Lost Planet game.
3798000	3799000	Now you can go download it.
3799000	3803000	And then download them for MotoGP. They have like three or four games on there.
3803000	3807000	And that was awesome. And now they don't do that anymore.
3807000	3815000	I mean, I really wish they would do that because a lot of, well, the majority of the people that are paying attention to E3 can't go to that.
3815000	3819000	Why do you think Nintendo is making you go to Best Buy and not just letting you download them to your Wii U?
3819000	3820000	Partnership.
3820000	3826000	I bet it's part partnership and it's also part so you can get the sales pitch while you're there about picking up a Wii U.
3826000	3834000	Because, you know, Nintendo has, just like Microsoft and just like any other company, has the people that go out to the stores.
3834000	3839000	Well, they're trying to sell the console too because the problem isn't getting people that own the Wii U to buy more games.
3839000	3841000	It's getting people to buy the Wii U.
3841000	3846000	Right. So why not have those people in the stores ready to try to sell the consoles?
3846000	3848000	I think it's a great, great concept.
3850000	3852000	Don't you want to buy a console today?
3852000	3853000	No.
3853000	3856000	Especially if they end up dropping the price, which I know is a long shot.
3856000	3860000	But, you know, now it's on sale. It's even cheaper than it was before. Don't you want to get one?
3860000	3863000	Have somebody there to put on a little bit of that pressure.
3863000	3867000	Do you think we'll see a Wii U Animal Crossing this year?
3867000	3872000	A Wii U Animal Crossing this year? No, not with the 3DS. We cannibalized the 3DS one too much.
3872000	3873000	Probably next year.
3873000	3877000	Because that one is going to be coming out within weeks of E3. So, yeah, probably next year.
3877000	3879000	Like it's really going to be anything innovative.
3879000	3882000	Yeah, right. Well, you can sit down now.
3882000	3888000	Ooh! You know what? I could sit down before. I could go get a latte and sit down.
3888000	3891000	But now you can. What were the other big things? There's benches.
3891000	3894000	You're the mayor. You can swim.
3894000	3899000	Well, okay, so to be fair, they did kind of change the main plot of sorts.
3899000	3905000	Yeah, I'm sorry, but does it have virtual console games like it did in the GameCube version? Because that was awesome.
3905000	3908000	I actually liked my indentured servitude to Tom Nook.
3908000	3916000	And considering that we're selling virtual console games for 30 cents, why can't you put some NES games in there?
3916000	3918000	It's not like you're losing money on that.
3918000	3924000	So Nintendo really wants to change the rules this year because they're doing the whole forget the press conference,
3924000	3929000	we're going to do Nintendo Direct, and now we're going to be taking the show on the road to Best Buy 2.
3929000	3934000	They are literally taking their case directly to fans. I do think it's smart, though, in the position Nintendo's in.
3934000	3940000	There's too much fucking smart when it comes to Nintendo on the internet, and then that kind of spills over into the media.
3940000	3948000	So Nintendo's just like, you know what? We're going to take our case directly to the fanboys who will pitch up a storm.
3948000	3949000	Yeah.
3949000	3952000	Who needs PR when you got people to do it for free?
3952000	3958000	Exactly. Exactly. So it's going to be interesting. I'm curious to see how this works out for them because it could be a game changer.
3958000	3967000	I am not going to sit here, though, and say E3 is dead or dying because there was a time when E3 didn't have anything to do with the media and all this stuff.
3967000	3974000	You know, before the internet, there was still E3, and granted, you would see screenshots and things of Nintendo power,
3974000	3982000	but it was not the blowout thing that it is today. E3 started because it's the one time during the year when everybody in the industry kind of gets together under the same roof,
3982000	3987000	and there's a lot of wheeling and dealing that happens at E3 that the media doesn't even know about.
3987000	3993000	Like, think about it. One year I went to E3, I think it was 2006, maybe it was, it might have been 2010, I don't know.
3993000	3998000	Apple had a booth at E3, or excuse me, not a booth. Apple had a conference room at E3.
3998000	4004000	It was a behind closed doors thing, and a lot of people were thinking, ooh, is Apple doing a game console? Ooh, ooh, you know, and that whole thing.
4004000	4009000	No, Apple was probably showing off the iPhone or the iPad, depending on whatever year it was.
4009000	4014000	That's probably what they were showing in that little room to developers who were there at the same roof.
4014000	4021000	That had nothing to do with the media. Apple was not rolling that out to the media yet, but Apple was probably, and again, this is a huge theory here,
4021000	4029000	because I don't know anything, but I'm assuming that that's part of the wheeling and dealing that happens at E3 that has nothing to do with the media interaction.
4029000	4037000	The media could not come to E3, and E3 I think would still happen. It might not be as big of a deal, but I think there would still be the necessity for the show.
4038000	4045000	So, anyhow, tangent. But let's move on with something that doesn't have to do with Nintendo.
4045000	4054000	It has to do with Steam, which we brought up earlier in the show. Kind of something interesting on Steam. It's called Steam Trading Cards, and it's...
4054000	4057000	I forgot I played Portal 2 because of this.
4057000	4058000	Did you get in the beta for this?
4058000	4063000	Yes. I actually have three extra passes I can share.
4063000	4070000	Give me one, because I went into the beta and I wanted to get this. Alright, well, maybe give some away to listeners or something.
4070000	4076000	But anyway, Steam Trading Cards are the new thing from Valve, and maybe you can speak on this better than I can, Logie.
4076000	4087000	Yes, Steam Trading Cards, they let you get Steam rewards when you play the game, so they're not the achievements, but achievements that will actually unlock these cards
4087000	4094000	that you can then use to, when you get a set together, get a new background or an increase in your friends list or something like that.
4094000	4099000	It's like hats for non-hat games, because you can generate these, too.
4099000	4101000	Oh, can you pay for them?
4101000	4105000	I think, well, the trading. I think maybe there might be some money exchanged.
4105000	4111000	Well, they're probably just trying to add to the trading pool and that thing. But it does seem like, in a way, it's all the same games.
4111000	4118000	I mean, yet again, it's Dota and Half-Life and Portal, which you would expect. Of course, the Valve games are going to be involved.
4118000	4123000	But they do have Don't Starve and Counter-Strike Global Offensive, so at least there's some other games participating.
4123000	4128000	But I would like to see more third parties kind of get in on this to really give value added to this, because...
4128000	4132000	Well, and I didn't really understand how it works either, as far as, like, see, here's the thing.
4132000	4140000	I went back to play Portal 2. I was actually just going to play Portal 2, and I noticed I don't have any of my achievements on Portal 2.
4140000	4142000	Like, they all disappeared somehow.
4142000	4143000	What?
4143000	4144000	Yeah. It's weird.
4144000	4155000	So I started playing it again, but I haven't gotten any cards or anything, and then today I got a notification saying that I got some new items in my inventory.
4155000	4161000	And so now I have three items marked as Steam Trading Card Beta Access.
4161000	4169000	And it says, Steam Trade Card Beta Access Extra Copy Grants Early Access to the Steam Trading Cards Beta Game Badges and New Profile.
4169000	4173000	Join Steam Trade Carding Group and post your feedback in the discussions area.
4173000	4181000	Select Add to My Game Library to Activate, which I tried to do because I didn't see it on my library, and it won't let me do that.
4181000	4185000	Well, you need to send one of those to the username. I just private messaged you.
4185000	4187000	So I can check that out.
4187000	4188000	I will do that.
4188000	4189000	Hooray!
4189000	4196000	Alright. What do you think of the whole thing as a concept, though? Let's just assume it works as we read it.
4196000	4200000	It's neat. It's more interesting than trophies. I mean, because a lot of times it's like, oh, achievement.
4200000	4202000	Yeah, just bring value to that.
4202000	4208000	I noticed ActDeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying, you can buy the trading cards through the Steam Community Market.
4208000	4213000	And he says, I sold two extra passes. I got $1.50 for each.
4213000	4216000	It's like selling stuff in the Diablo real money auction house.
4216000	4219000	Valve didn't probably take a dollar out of that.
4219000	4226000	Sounds interesting. I guess any excuse to go back and play Portal and Half-Life and all that, right?
4226000	4228000	Let's move on. DarkSakura.
4228000	4236000	Well, this is something that has my hubby super, super excited. In fact, he was practically bouncing in his seat over this.
4237000	4245000	Gran Turismo 6 has been announced. And it's going to be, there's a demo going to be out in July.
4245000	4254000	The information actually hit, I think, the European Sony news networks not too long ago.
4254000	4264000	They're saying that it's going to be on the PS3 and that they're basically going to keep it on that system.
4264000	4268000	They don't say anything about it being out for the next gen system.
4268000	4273000	They're going to have GT Academy in 2013 as well.
4273000	4279000	And that this new version is going to have 1,200 cars, 33 locations, and 71 layouts.
4279000	4286000	So that's seven more locations than Gran Turismo 5 had. And it will have the UK Silverstone circuit.
4287000	4289000	Hmm.
4289000	4295000	It says new physics engine, new modeling, all kinds of stuff.
4295000	4296000	And I will buy it.
4296000	4297000	Did you hear that?
4297000	4298000	No.
4298000	4299000	Dan goes, and I will buy it.
4299000	4300000	Of course you will.
4300000	4303000	He came in, raised his hands in the air and goes, and I will buy it.
4303000	4308000	Well, interesting though that it's not PlayStation 4. I think that's the thing that really shocked people is that,
4308000	4314000	well, PlayStation 4 has this whole racing club, or what do they call it in that game?
4314000	4315000	The drive club?
4315000	4318000	The drive club or whatever, but yet there's no Gran Turismo.
4318000	4321000	And this is going to be on the PlayStation 3.
4321000	4328000	Without the PlayStation 4 being backwards compatible, Gran Turismo 6 is a great reason not to upgrade.
4328000	4331000	Yeah, but also put it out this way.
4331000	4335000	If you want to guarantee sales, why not put it out for the system that everyone already has?
4335000	4341000	Well, yeah, but that's going to be a problem when the new systems start coming to get people to buy them.
4341000	4342000	I don't think so.
4342000	4348000	I think that they're going to have maybe some special edition come out later that everyone's going to go,
4348000	4350000	ooh, we need this instead, and meh.
4350000	4352000	Gran Turismo 6 HD or something?
4352000	4353000	Something like that.
4353000	4358000	WhatupG in our chat says, each of the PlayStation systems have had two main Gran Turismo games,
4358000	4362000	so I expect PlayStation 4 to have Gran Turismo 7 and 8.
4362000	4365000	So maybe there's just a pattern that's trying to not be broken here.
4365000	4368000	That's a good point.
4368000	4373000	And actually, they were saying that for Gran Turismo 5, 10 million copies were sold.
4373000	4382000	And that it is, the Gran Turismo franchise itself is their most successful franchise ever, especially in Europe.
4382000	4387000	70 million copies over the span of the series.
4387000	4388000	Alright.
4388000	4389000	Yeah.
4389000	4390000	Well, let's travel around.
4390000	4392000	I think it's a wise move to put it on PS3.
4393000	4396000	I guess, but it's very strange.
4396000	4399000	It seems a little bit like cannibalizing PlayStation 4,
4399000	4404000	but I guess they feel there'll still be plenty of people wanting to pick up a PlayStation 4 for Drive Club.
4404000	4405000	So, I don't know.
4405000	4411000	See, I have a feeling that they're going to really push a Gran Turismo 7 for PS4
4411000	4417000	and make that a big selling point, like around, say, some sort of major holiday or big sales period.
4417000	4421000	Yeah, but it's just weird to me that Gran Turismo 6 and Drive Club for PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 4
4421000	4424000	are all around the same time, essentially. It's weird.
4424000	4429000	They're saying that they may release another version on PlayStation 4 later on after launch.
4429000	4430000	Of course.
4430000	4432000	See, that's pretty much what I was anticipating.
4432000	4433000	Yeah. Alright.
4433000	4437000	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that'll be coming out a little bit sooner than Gran Turismo 6,
4437000	4439000	as in games that are out this week.
4439000	4441000	And we'll start with Loki in the US.
4441000	4444000	This week, there's actually quite a few things.
4445000	4454000	Starting off, Resident Evil Revelations HD is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.
4454000	4460000	And then I know the game that everybody's super excited for, Fast and the Furious Showdown,
4460000	4465000	which is being developed by the guys that did the NASCAR games.
4465000	4472000	That's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii U, and the 3DS.
4473000	4481000	And then there's the Worms Collection, which is kind of a re-release of some of the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network games.
4481000	4485000	That's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
4485000	4490000	Also, Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes on the Wii U.
4490000	4500000	And on the 3DS, on Friday, actually, we'll be getting Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D.
4501000	4504000	And that's going to be coming out as well.
4504000	4508000	And last game this week, Sniper Elite V2 on the Wii U.
4508000	4510000	So hey, there's Wii U games coming out.
4510000	4513000	Unfortunately, there are games that have come out a long time ago, like a year ago.
4513000	4516000	So, give or take.
4517000	4522000	Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases that are going to happen over there.
4522000	4529000	Starting off with the PlayStation 3 this week on May 23rd, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition.
4529000	4535000	BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend, which is getting a price cut that's going into the Best Hits collection.
4535000	4540000	Kamen Rider Batteride War in regular and premium editions is out this week from Namco Bandai.
4540000	4541000	I would play that.
4541000	4543000	Or as they call it over there, Bandai Namco.
4543000	4547000	Terraria is getting a Japanese release, believe it or not, and that will be out this week.
4547000	4551000	As well as The Sims 3 Pets, getting a price reduction on PlayStation 3.
4552000	4559000	Also on PS3 this week, Z slash X, Zillions of Enemy X, Zetsukai no Crusade.
4559000	4562000	Yes, that is Zillions of Enemy X.
4563000	4565000	How many zillions?
4566000	4567000	Rob, you just made me sad.
4567000	4568000	Why?
4568000	4572000	Because that just makes me actually want a zillion game.
4572000	4575000	Like on Master System only all updated and new.
4575000	4582000	On the Xbox 360 this week, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is there as well in a regular and a limited set.
4582000	4584000	That's pretty much all you get on the 360 this week.
4584000	4589000	Going to the Vita, BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend also gets a price cut there.
4589000	4595000	And Valhalla Knights 3 comes out this week from Marvelous Entertainment over in Japan.
4595000	4597000	Checking out the Wii U, yes there is a game.
4597000	4600000	It's Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is out there as well.
4600000	4603000	So all the consoles in Japan getting that.
4603000	4608000	On the 3DS this week there is a new 3DS XL model, or as they call it the LL.
4608000	4614000	It's the Shimagami Tensei 4 Limited model because Shimagami Tensei 4 is out this week in Japan.
4614000	4616000	That's going to be a pretty big release.
4616000	4618000	I'm sure there's some people going to be importing that one.
4618000	4621000	You can actually get that retail or download.
4621000	4622000	There's a whole accessory set.
4622000	4624000	You can get a skin for your 3D.
4624000	4628000	If you're a Shimagami Tensei fan, you're probably importing tons of shit this week from Japan.
4628000	4630000	Good luck to your wallet.
4631000	4638000	If you are not a Shimagami Tensei fan, perhaps Tamagotchi no Doki Doki Dream Omisechi would be of interest to you.
4638000	4642000	Yes, it's another Tamagotchi game on the 3DS.
4642000	4646000	I think you should just get Shimagami Tensei 4 if you're going to import one or the other.
4646000	4647000	Just saying.
4647000	4652000	Lastly on the PSP, yes they are still making games for the PSP in Japan.
4653000	4658000	Zeroji no Kane 2 Cinderella Halloween Wedding in regular and deluxe editions.
4658000	4661000	And Rakuen Danshi coming out this week.
4661000	4663000	What is Cinderella Wedding?
4663000	4665000	That is not, I don't think the Disney Cinderella.
4665000	4669000	This looks like one of those games based off an anime.
4669000	4671000	Oh god, it looks like one of those romance games.
4671000	4679000	Because I see girl and guy in the bar, girl hanging off guy, guy kissing girl and all this stuff.
4679000	4682000	So it must be one of those series.
4682000	4686000	Alright, that's it for Japan. Let's travel over to the UK.
4686000	4690000	On the 22nd we have the incredible adventures of Van Helsing.
4690000	4692000	Midna stop eating that!
4692000	4695000	Sorry, Midna was eating my headphone cable.
4697000	4703000	On the 24th we have Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D.
4703000	4711000	Dust an Elysian Tail, Fast and the Furious Showdown, Big Whoop, Resident Evil Revelations, and Sniper Elite V2.
4713000	4720000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase TEST.
4720000	4727000	Alright, there it is UK. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4727000	4728000	Loki.
4728000	4736000	Alright, so Nintendo has kind of taken an action against these Let's Play videos on YouTube.
4736000	4745000	What's going to happen is, partnering I guess with YouTube, they're going to be using their content ID match system
4745000	4758000	to basically take the ad revenue that these Let's Play videos are getting if they're monetized.
4758000	4761000	And that's all going to be going to Nintendo.
4761000	4768000	And then also they're going to be having ads I guess before and after the videos as well.
4768000	4773000	I guess it's going to somehow automatically get added in for Nintendo stuff.
4775000	4777000	So that kind of sucks, I guess.
4777000	4784000	I know YouTube has policies against the Let's Play stuff, although there's still a ton of it on there.
4784000	4791000	And it's kind of confusing because some companies will let you do Let's Plays on their stuff, like Minecraft for example.
4791000	4795000	There's a big thing saying, hey, film whatever you want, do whatever you want.
4795000	4798000	It's cool.
4798000	4807000	And I know they're not taking the videos down, but the fact that they're kind of like, hey, we're taking all the profits from it.
4807000	4812000	That's kind of like, I almost wish they would just take them down instead.
4812000	4816000	It's kind of a little weird.
4816000	4818000	Well, here's the thing.
4818000	4823000	The thing I was most surprised to learn from this whole story is that there's people that make livings off of doing Let's Play videos.
4823000	4826000	I had no idea you could make that kind of money on YouTube.
4826000	4828000	And I'm like, wow, I'm in the wrong business.
4828000	4831000	Apparently I need to do some sassy Let's Play videos or something.
4831000	4839000	Yes, I was joking with Rob saying that, hey, because I do monetize some of the videos I make for YouTube.
4839000	4843000	Just for shits and giggles because I know I'm not going to get millions of hits on it.
4843000	4847000	But hey, let's see what kind of ad money will rake in from this.
4847000	4854000	With the few videos that I have, and a few of them have like a thousand views or something, a whopping 26 cents.
4855000	4856000	Nice.
4856000	4858000	Yeah. I'm retiring.
4858000	4861000	Do you think Nintendo is evil for what they did?
4861000	4863000	I don't think it's a good idea.
4863000	4869000	I mean, I understand that they're saying, oh, you guys shouldn't be making money off of our content.
4869000	4875000	But it's less about making money off their content and more of just like, you know, it's commentary and stuff.
4875000	4882000	You can't really do a Let's Play video or like a commentary on gameplay without showing the gameplay.
4882000	4887000	Unless you have some sort of weird like riff tracks thing that you do.
4887000	4891000	I've seen a lot of anger directed at Nintendo on the Internet this week over this whole thing.
4891000	4893000	And it's like, OK, to some extent, I do get it.
4893000	4897000	And I feel I can understand where the YouTube community feels a little bit slighted on this.
4897000	4902000	And I can certainly understand, hey, this is the Internet and we can just pick up and move it to somewhere else.
4902000	4904000	You know, I'm sure there's a lot of that talk going on right now.
4904000	4910000	But you guys, Microsoft did this in October of last year.
4910000	4916000	In fact, I believe it was October 9th was the date the news went out is that Microsoft now they did something a little different.
4916000	4923000	But they actually put it in their whole little terms of service that you cannot earn money from these games like Halo four and so forth.
4923000	4928000	And that if you cannot enroll in a YouTube partner program, if you are playing one of these Microsoft games.
4928000	4936000	Here's how that's how I think a lot of gamers forgot about that in their anger, because everybody's like, oh, Nintendo's just doing this because the Wii U sucks and all this stuff.
4936000	4940000	And I'm like, well, Microsoft did the same fucking thing seven months ago. Does that mean the 360 sucks?
4940000	4947000	But they do this. They're doing this now. And then, of course, we don't know it's confirmed yet.
4947000	4954000	But the rumor is they're going to be kind of rolling out the same features that the PlayStation 4 has where you can share videos and content gameplay and stuff.
4954000	4961000	If if they have it where you can live stream and do commentary over that stuff.
4961000	4968000	So you're not going to be able to monetize those videos that you put out there, even though you're I mean, they're making it super easy for you to do that.
4968000	4974000	They just want you that freely advertise their game without any sort of, you know, that's the thing.
4974000	4982000	It's like you're kind of advertising their game. It's not like you I mean, you could technically you could spoil, I guess, stuff from the game, but it's not the same as playing a game.
4982000	4985000	It's not like if it was a movie, like you're watching a movie or something like that.
4985000	4994000	It's gameplay. There's actual, you know, interaction that's involved in each one of those, you know, experiences could be unique depending on the game, I guess.
4994000	4999000	But I wouldn't say once again, those interactions were designed by Nintendo.
4999000	5003000	I got that's the place I saw that argument. You want the word to get out of every game.
5003000	5007000	You want your game to look fun. You wanted to gather the people, whether they're seeing it like on.
5007000	5011000	If I come over and watch someone playing a game, how's that any different than watching it over the Internet?
5011000	5018000	I'm not saying I necessarily disagree completely that Nintendo made a bad decision with this.
5018000	5025000	But I also think there's a lot of gamer entitlement going on here that you guys if it was a movie.
5025000	5033000	Do you think I could put up a copy of Star Trek into darkness with my commentary on YouTube and not have that get struck down with probably something a lot worse than the monitor?
5033000	5035000	It would be a copyright strike.
5035000	5043000	You know, I think if I were to put something up, you know who's really fucking crazy about their intellectual property is sports.
5043000	5046000	The NBA and the NFL, especially the NFL.
5046000	5053000	If I were to put up like classic football clips and be talking over them and stuff, they would come after me legally.
5053000	5055000	It would be a lot worse than what Nintendo is doing here.
5055000	5058000	And I kind of think there's gamer entitlement going on here.
5058000	5066000	And this is just a rude awakening. And I'm sorry, but I think gamers are getting it a lot better than some of these other.
5066000	5071000	Well, Rob, also keep in mind, like for another example, this is the RiffTrax guys have to get licensing.
5071000	5078000	Which and they don't even don't they just do their sales that they don't attach?
5078000	5080000	Well, they don't have to get licensing.
5080000	5090000	They only have to get licensing for when they're actually doing like a show, like an actual movie in a theater with the stuff they do is in the public domain now.
5090000	5092000	Yeah. But anything else?
5092000	5097000	Yeah. Anything else that they do like a RiffTrax for like a Transformers movie or something like that?
5097000	5100000	They don't have to get permission from Paramount to do that.
5100000	5102000	They're just it's an audio track that they make.
5102000	5105000	It doesn't have anything. They're not releasing it with the video on there.
5105000	5118000	But that's the same thing, though, is you people know the whole reason that you're having this share thing on the PlayStation 4 and stuff is to kind of you want to share those moments with, you know, your friends and stuff like that.
5118000	5126000	But if you're going to like start, you know, say, OK, we want you to get that footage out there, get that footage out there and then start hammering them down.
5126000	5129000	Oh, I'm sorry, but that's not that footage was too long.
5129000	5133000	I'm sorry, but you you're trying to make some money off of this.
5133000	5141000	They're not going to be motivated to continue doing those let's play videos if they make no money off of it, because that's they're doing that.
5141000	5145000	They're trying to put out content. And if you're saying, well, you can't make any money off this.
5145000	5154000	I mean, that's basically I mean, that's I know it's a little stretch, but it's almost like saying, you know, we're telling you what you can do, what you can and can't do with this game.
5154000	5157000	Like, oh, sorry, you can't sell used. We're telling you what you can and can't do.
5157000	5165000	In part, that's where I do agree with you, is that this wasn't a smart PR move on Nintendo's part on a time where they need a lot of good news.
5165000	5174000	And I think what should happen here, and this is probably a limitation of YouTube, quite honestly, is that maybe there needs to be something where it's a split revenue stream or something like that.
5174000	5179000	But Loki, if people are making money, they're making a living off of let's play videos.
5179000	5184000	That tells me what forty thousand dollars a year minimum right to to live off of.
5184000	5187000	You got maybe in some parts of the country, thirty thousand or less. I don't know.
5187000	5192000	But you're talking multiply that by how many people on on YouTube are doing it for a living.
5192000	5196000	Fifty one hundred. But that's that's a it's a big chunk of views.
5196000	5201000	A lot of views required. It's like thousands of views to get like a penny.
5201000	5211000	I mean, seriously, I know. In fact, I'm going to look it up right now because I can look at my monetization, see what exactly, you know, I'm bringing in, I guess.
5212000	5222000	But again, you know, and I'm not dissing the talent of these individuals and their funny, witty stuff and so forth, because that would be kind of biting the hand that, you know, makes up this show here.
5222000	5231000	But then again, we're not displaying images of the game in motion the whole time during that during the show or whatever. I don't know. I don't know.
5231000	5235000	Yeah, but it's stupid, though, that they were also not trying to make a living off.
5235000	5248000	Well, here's the problem, too, is they basically say, OK, yeah, we're going to have this partnership program that we're going to partner with, you know, IGN or something like that or, you know, you know, Machinima or something like that.
5248000	5253000	And then you have to you have to become an affiliate with them, you know, but they may not let you become an affiliate with them.
5253000	5262000	So once again, you're given these big guys. How's an indie supposed to shine if, you know, you're just saying, oh, sorry, you can't show any of our gameplay.
5262000	5267000	We only want IGN to show our gameplay, find another way to monetize it.
5267000	5280000	But how do you do that? I mean, there's I mean, if if I knew I would have the money, I'm saying, though, that if there's another way to monetize it, they're going to still hit you for the same thing, that you're making money off of our videos or off our content.
5280000	5285000	You know, what if it's like PayPal donations or something like that for a Twitch stream or something?
5285000	5291000	I'm sure people make money off of that, but I just I don't know.
5291000	5301000	I don't think that I think there's going to be a standardized way that people are going to make money off of videos, whether it be monetization via ads or whatever.
5301000	5307000	Oh, maybe they can cater those ads for those Nintendo videos to Nintendo products, something like that.
5307000	5309000	That seems to make more sense to me.
5309000	5326000	Yeah, I do think, again, I think the smarter thing for Nintendo to do would have been to partner with these people to come to a solution that has both people in mind, either it's split revenue or it's ads that support Nintendo or or whatever it is.
5326000	5329000	But by putting the hammer down, they made themselves look like dicks.
5329000	5332000	But my point is they are well within their legal right to do so.
5332000	5341000	And I think people need to give give Nintendo a little bit of a break here is that when you hear about that people are making a living off of this.
5341000	5344000	I mean, Nintendo is entitled to some of that money.
5344000	5347000	I'm rolling the money. I just made seven more cents.
5347000	5349000	I'm at thirty one cents.
5349000	5352000	Here's a good example of right here.
5352000	5357000	So some of the movie or some of the videos I've been uploading, like different videos and stuff like that.
5357000	5363000	The one they have the most views on so far is like a how to sideload apps.
5363000	5365000	Tutorial, I guess it's only a few minutes long.
5365000	5369000	So I have twenty one or two thousand one hundred seventy views.
5369000	5372000	Six hundred or six thousand nine hundred seventy seven minutes.
5372000	5375000	Twenty four cents is what it made off of that.
5375000	5383000	Wow. So just to give you an idea of how much how many views you have to get millions, millions and millions of views combined over your you know, your channel.
5383000	5385000	So it's going to take a lot of work.
5385000	5391000	Just nobody, you know, putting out a let's play video is not going to make a ton of money.
5391000	5393000	And they really want that ad money.
5393000	5400000	I mean, really, you want that like maybe a buck that they're going to make if they get thousands of views.
5400000	5403000	I mean, seriously, it seems a little greedy.
5403000	5406000	All right. Going to a couple more chat comments here and then we got to move on with the show.
5406000	5414000	But as the show says, the problem is that a lot of people on the Internet feel that they are entitled or have the right to use and access any sort of media freely.
5414000	5420000	And without having to pay for it, trying to convince people otherwise leads to hate and venom being spewed in many ways.
5420000	5427000	These people's opinions are so unwavering that no matter what facts you tell them, people will still feel that sense of entitlement.
5427000	5431000	Shadow Next Gen says the people who make these videos might take a few hours to make them.
5431000	5438000	They don't have the right to make money off of the new Zelda title that Nintendo took years and millions of dollars to make.
5438000	5451000	Yeah, but look at what kind of money is Nintendo making off their title versus if the amount of effort Nintendo is putting into their title versus the return versus the person that spent like an hour to make a video and his return.
5451000	5455000	I think it's fair because you look at the amount of money that they're making.
5455000	5460000	It's not like the guy that's making the Let's Play videos making more money than Nintendo on these titles.
5460000	5465000	I mean, I just don't see where Nintendo is necessarily losing money on this.
5465000	5471000	Are they suggesting that people are watching these Let's Plays and going, yep, that's enough of that game, I don't need to buy it now.
5471000	5475000	I'm sorry, that's just like saying, oh hey, someone pirated our game, we lost a sale.
5475000	5480000	You can't attribute that. There's no data to correlate lost sales.
5480000	5487000	Make all the excuses you want, but the fact of the matter is, your system's not selling well because you don't have any games on it.
5487000	5495000	MM2K says, YouTube just needs to establish a standard fee against revenue of anyone using copyrighted material, maybe 5-10%.
5495000	5509000	Again though, I'm with you on that for games, but like movies, I can't post a copy of Star Trek Into Darkness on YouTube and expect that, oh Paramount gets 5-10% because I'm giving my sassy commentary over this movie that just came out.
5509000	5514000	You know? There's got to be something there.
5514000	5518000	Here's what needs to happen, and this I think would be fine.
5518000	5524000	Nintendo needs to be one of those companies like Mojang with Minecraft saying, hey, you know what?
5524000	5534000	We're cool with you putting the videos out there and doing whatever, but if you monetize our videos, then maybe that they have Nintendo ads on them or something like that.
5534000	5548000	Obviously that's not something that they can control, but hey, if they can go out and seek with this content ID service and somehow monetize or get those videos to have the ad revenue go back to Nintendo, then I'm sure that they have a way to target ads to Nintendo products.
5548000	5553000	And I think that would be fair enough because they're getting their products out there and they're advertised.
5553000	5563000	The people are more inclined to put out these videos to spread the word about these Nintendo games.
5563000	5573000	For example, I haven't played New Super Mario Bros. U and I watch some Let's Play videos and I'm like, hey, that looks like a pretty fun game. Maybe I should go buy it.
5573000	5582000	If you're going to try to get these people not to put these videos out there, I'm never going to hear about this game.
5582000	5594000	My final thought on this whole thing is that, you know, again, although Nintendo maybe didn't have the best timing with this sort of move, this is not something that's going to be limited to Nintendo and it is not limited to Nintendo.
5594000	5601000	Again, Microsoft did it. Sega did it with the whole Shining Force or something. They were taking this one random game. They were taking down all these videos.
5601000	5614000	You know, this is still a new media that a lot of companies are exploring and I'm sorry, but if you are just using this to further your Nintendo hate boner, you need to spread the hate around equally.
5614000	5622000	Your position needs to be the same for all these companies that are doing it. So that's kind of one of my big things with this.
5622000	5626000	If you're going to be mad, be mad at everybody.
5626000	5636000	Alright, let's move on and do one more story here before the classic game of the week. And hooray! It's a porn story! Yay!
5636000	5637000	Kids like porn.
5637000	5645000	Yay! Here it is. Hardcore pornography apparently coming to the next Xbox. At least that's what the headlines all say.
5645000	5655000	Here's what it's really about. Sugar DVD. They do films like Hairy Asian Schoolgirl's Masturbate. That's a thing.
5655000	5658000	I think that's just a made up title.
5658000	5660000	If it exists, it's on the internet somewhere.
5660000	5670000	They're going to bring their streaming services to the next Xbox. It's already on Playstation 3. You can get it for $7.95 a month.
5671000	5678000	Now I believe this is not something where you exactly download an app and that whole thing. It's just you access it through the web browser.
5678000	5683000	It's just a website that's optimized for the system.
5683000	5691000	They had the same story come out when the Xbox 360 got Internet Explorer. They're like, we're the first people to have porn on the Xbox.
5691000	5698000	No, I'm sorry. It had a DVD drive. You were not the first to have porn on the Xbox. That was a streamed video.
5699000	5705000	Is there really a porn called Don't Tell My Wife I Ass-Fucked the Babysitter? That's a pretty great parody.
5705000	5708000	I think that's Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead. There's a little parody on that.
5708000	5710000	That sounds hilarious.
5710000	5712000	I think that's actually a real porn album.
5712000	5716000	There you go. Well, you'll find out on the new Xbox very soon.
5716000	5720000	Here's the quote from Sugar DVD's Rebecca Bolen.
5720000	5726000	The quote, any console would benefit from having unlimited HD adult content at the click of a button.
5728000	5732000	Dark Soccer, did you hear that? All you got to do is click your mouse.
5732000	5734000	Yay!
5736000	5737000	Yes.
5737000	5739000	By the way, Rob, that does exist. I looked it up.
5739000	5743000	It is. Yes. I was going to say, they have a lot of them.
5743000	5745000	My search history is hilarious.
5745000	5749000	What was that one New Year's Eve, it was got to be 2006 or 2007,
5749000	5753000	where we were looking up the pornography on the Nintendo Wii web browser,
5753000	5761000	and we found the pterodactyl porn, which was a guy in a pterodactyl suit having sex with some girl,
5761000	5766000	and it was hilarious. Just the little motions the guy would make.
5766000	5770000	And then we were trying to look up, for some reason we were looking up Donkey Punch,
5770000	5772000	and there was a guy dressed up like a donkey.
5772000	5775000	That would actually punch, yeah. Hilarious.
5777000	5779000	When in doubt, more porn stories.
5779000	5785000	Alright, let's travel to a time when, you know, a porn game, porn on the console,
5785000	5790000	was Custer's Revenge and Bubble Bath Babes, and Miss Nude World 96.
5790000	5792000	That was porn in gaming.
5792000	5797000	It's the classic game of the week, where Dark Soccer is going to walk into her classic gaming vault,
5797000	5799000	and she can do that tonight. She's literally right there.
5799000	5800000	I am.
5800000	5805000	Find a game that she says, hey, you kids should be playing this game, dammit.
5805000	5807000	Now I don't think she picked a porno game, so don't get too excited,
5807000	5810000	but Dark Soccer picked something just as good as a porno.
5810000	5812000	What's the classic game of the week?
5812000	5816000	Today's classic game is Hagane, The Final Conflict,
5816000	5820000	which is not a game that came out widespread in America.
5820000	5824000	It was one of those blockbuster only games, like Final Fight Guy.
5824000	5826000	And so this is a game I do not own.
5826000	5830000	I would love to own it, however, it is $700 on eBay right now.
5830000	5831000	Holy moly.
5831000	5833000	Yeah, I'm not even joking.
5833000	5836000	Let me get to some of the audio from the game here.
5836000	5842000	Okay. It came out in 1994, and it's a side-scrolling action game.
5842000	5847000	It was developed by Keita Amemiya and Red Entertainment.
5847000	5850000	I almost said Redertainment, you know, one of our listeners.
5850000	5855000	But it was Red Entertainment. It was published by Hudson Soft for the Super Nintendo.
5855000	5860000	And like I said, in the U.S., it was only one of those blockbuster video games.
5860000	5864000	Now, I do have the other blockbuster game, Final Fight Guy.
5864000	5866000	That one goes for $300.
5868000	5869000	Just saying.
5869000	5874000	So anyway, the story behind this is that the Huma and Koma ninja clans
5874000	5881000	are basically a big rivalry against each other for the Holy Grail.
5882000	5885000	And the Huma clan is based off of the Chinese zodiac.
5885000	5888000	And you play this one guy who is in full armor.
5888000	5893000	And Dan and I, when Dan was playing, because we have a version of it.
5895000	5896000	Quote, version.
5897000	5898000	Ambulator.
5899000	5900000	Huh?
5900000	5901000	Ambulator.
5901000	5902000	Yeah.
5902000	5909000	Dan was talking about some of the resemblance to Strider.
5909000	5912000	I was going to say, you love this game because it's freaking Strider.
5912000	5913000	It's a Strider ripoff.
5913000	5916000	I didn't know Dan likes anything Strider or Strider related.
5916000	5919000	It's Strider meets Shinobi, is what I'm looking at here.
5919000	5920000	Yeah.
5920000	5922000	And this is actually a game I would...
5922000	5927000	I don't even care if it's just the Super Famicom version, which is still like $50 on eBay here.
5927000	5929000	I would love to have this game.
5929000	5932000	But the big problem about it is that it's freaking hard.
5932000	5934000	Super hard and no save.
5935000	5937000	That's why emulators are awesome.
5938000	5939000	Save states.
5940000	5949000	But basically you're playing as a ninja cyborg who is going to kill all of the Koma Clan.
5949000	5950000	Rawr.
5951000	5958000	And basically it's just a really, really cool side-scrolling game.
5958000	5959000	Very difficult.
5960000	5967000	But one thing that it did get some less than stellar reviews on was actually its graphics.
5967000	5972000	It was said not to show off the best of Super Nintendo at the time.
5974000	5978000	So, I don't think Hagane is on Virtual Console.
5978000	5980000	It was sorta...
5981000	5988000	It wasn't really, I mean, considering it was only released to video stores or whatever, it wasn't really...
5988000	5990000	I mean, we haven't seen Final Fight Guy.
5990000	5991000	Yeah.
5991000	5992000	So...
5992000	5994000	Yeah, this was a very limited release.
5994000	5997000	You could only rent this game at Blockbuster.
5997000	5999000	And then, like I said...
5999000	6002000	Eric RPG in our chatroom says that they had it at his video store.
6002000	6006000	So it may not have just been Blockbuster, but maybe like video stores in general.
6006000	6009000	Well, no, these were actually released only for Blockbuster.
6009000	6013000	If they showed up at other video stores, then they were purchased from Blockbuster.
6013000	6014000	Oh, weird. Okay.
6014000	6015000	Yeah.
6015000	6023000	So, because Blockbuster had like a limited release deal just on certain Japanese-only games.
6025000	6027000	So, this was one of them.
6027000	6030000	And honestly, I would love to have this game in my collection.
6030000	6032000	It's really, really difficult.
6032000	6035000	But a very rich, good side-scrolling game.
6037000	6042000	And don't say fucking Blockbuster, because Blockbuster is dead, pretty much.
6042000	6045000	The one around the corner from my house is gone. They are vanishing.
6045000	6051000	I saw one in a strip mall the other day, and I was like, oh my god, it's a museum.
6051000	6052000	Yeah.
6053000	6057000	I think that's where I picked up a copy of Parappa 2.
6058000	6064000	Okay, so I'm checking on eBay right now. There's one for $295.
6064000	6069000	One for a buy it now of $700, and another one without the box for $400.
6070000	6071000	Dang.
6071000	6073000	Japanese copies, $45.
6074000	6080000	So, I don't even care. You know me, I have all kinds of imports anyway, so.
6080000	6087000	But I'm putting up the $700 one in chat just so people can see the cover and everything.
6087000	6090000	All right. Well, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6090000	6095000	Hagane for the Super Nintendo. Good luck finding it.
6095000	6097000	Yeah, and if you find it, give it to me.
6097000	6099000	As a tip.
6099000	6101000	Yeah, because you love me.
6101000	6105000	All right, that's going to do it for part A of Orange On Radio, but don't go anywhere.
6105000	6108000	We have plenty more to come, including the FUGL Question of the Week,
6108000	6110000	all about this controversial Nintendo Let's Play topic.
6110000	6113000	More stories about EA and Nintendo.
6113000	6118000	We're going to talk a little bit about the stuff from the Google press thing this week that has to do with Nintendo.
6118000	6123000	A couple E3 stories for you guys, and plenty more, including your phone calls and emails,
6123000	6127000	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6153000	6155000	Watch out, Dark Soccer. Shots fired.
6155000	6157000	What?
6157000	6158000	Live.
6158000	6163000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 505 in progress.
6163000	6167000	Thanks to Redertainment for starting shit here on the second half of our show.
6167000	6169000	Appreciate that. If you want to leave a bumper for our show.
6169000	6174000	More information available on our forum at the VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com.
6174000	6178000	We're finally getting a few of them in. I have another new one to play next week, so thanks to you guys.
6178000	6181000	If you want to use your voice to tell our listeners something,
6181000	6185000	and possibly start a fight with Jamie in the process, go ahead and do so.
6185000	6186000	So there you go.
6186000	6187000	You know what?
6187000	6188000	What?
6188000	6191000	Haderson was. There was another game that I played this week that I totally forgot.
6191000	6196000	Let's see. Before we get into rapid fire news, there was a couple other things I wanted to bring up.
6196000	6200000	One of them was there was another game that I played this week that I totally forgot to talk about,
6200000	6206000	and that is Just Dance 4, believe it or not, on Xbox 360, because I think it's on several platforms.
6206000	6210000	But Target was having a sale this week on all the Just Dance games for Kinect.
6210000	6211000	Twenty bucks.
6211000	6213000	So I picked up Just Dance 4 for twenty bucks.
6213000	6215000	I got to say, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.
6215000	6217000	You know I love music games, right?
6217000	6224000	And I've been very partial to the Dance Central series, and last time I remember playing a Just Dance game.
6224000	6226000	Excuse me, a Just Dance game. I wasn't really into it.
6226000	6233000	But I got to say, I really like, especially in Just Dance 4, well A, the song list is very like, what the fuck?
6233000	6238000	Like there's some really, like, you know, they have the stuff you'd expect to hear, like some top 40 hits.
6238000	6242000	Like J-Lo on the floor, and Pink, So What.
6242000	6246000	But then like there's these picks. They have a cover of the Time Warp.
6246000	6247000	What?
6247000	6248000	Yeah, which is hilarious.
6248000	6252000	They have Army of Lovers with Crucified. I don't know if you guys remember that song.
6252000	6253000	You love that song.
6253000	6254000	Remember that song?
6254000	6259000	Seriously, Google that music video. It is hilarious.
6259000	6260000	That song is in the game.
6260000	6261000	Does it have a video?
6261000	6264000	No, it doesn't have the original video. None of them have the original videos.
6264000	6267000	But the Army of Lovers videos, all their videos were hilarious.
6267000	6271000	But does it at least have like a hilarious, because you know how they kind of dress up the actors?
6271000	6275000	They are dressed, like the little actors are all dressed up. They are dressed up for that.
6275000	6280000	I actually haven't played that song because it's a higher difficulty, and I've been warming up a little more into Just Dance.
6280000	6290000	But I really like that they have these full workout modes where it'll actually do like a, kind of like a warm up little like, you know, generic electro beat or whatever you pick.
6290000	6292000	And then you'll do a bunch of songs and you do like a cool down.
6292000	6296000	So actually the way it, it's not just a bunch of songs on shuffle counting the calories.
6296000	6297000	That's pretty cool.
6297000	6301000	Yeah, that I really liked. So for 20 bucks, I was very happy with that.
6301000	6306000	So yeah, that was a game I forgot to mention earlier. So there you go.
6306000	6309000	I guess we can get into some rapid fire news now if you want.
6310000	6320000	Sure. So the, uh, the folks behind the incredible machine, which I sunk a lot of hours into, um, back for one of my first computer games.
6320000	6325000	Um, they're making, I love that game by the way. Fantastic.
6325000	6336000	That's like, uh, what do they call those? The Rube Goldberg machines or whatever, which reminds me, or as everybody knows it, the opening sequence to Pee Wee's Big Adventure with a Mr. T cereal.
6336000	6337000	The little machine that makes them breakfast.
6337000	6338000	I pity the fools that don't eat my cereal.
6338000	6340000	Remember that?
6341000	6343000	Oh no, Mr. Eggman.
6343000	6349000	All right. Uh, so now they have a new game called Contraption Maker and that's going to be coming out later this year.
6349000	6364000	Um, apparently they said it's also going to be mod friendly and, uh, you know, have some way to allow players to build more elaborate puzzles, um, and machines that can air connect with each other and you can be able to share them over the internet.
6364000	6369000	Um, that's awesome. So yeah, they'll be coming out.
6369000	6374000	Um, probably have to pick that up because I love the incredible machine and, uh, this is also cool.
6374000	6380000	Another Kickstarter, a game called Auto Duel and it's a multiplayer car combat game.
6380000	6388000	So probably, uh, it's a good thing that, uh, David Jeff has signed on, um, to help make this game.
6388000	6395000	And on top of that, Zach Norman, the creator of Interstate 76 and Vigilante 8.
6395000	6401000	Well, at least I think he created Vigilante 8, but Vigilante 8, one of my most favorite car combat games.
6401000	6404000	Um, that's a pretty good pedigree right there.
6404000	6408000	So, uh, looking forward to that and how to maybe back that when that comes out.
6409000	6417000	Um, yeah, I don't know if they've actually, uh, released or have this out yet as a Kickstarter.
6417000	6419000	Probably soon though.
6419000	6424000	Um, and last but not least, the Assassin's Creed movie has a date, or at least a time frame.
6424000	6430000	May 2015. I also saw, was it July 2016, the beginning of the Angry Birds movie.
6430000	6435000	By then, I don't think Angry Birds will be a thing anymore, or at least anyone will care.
6435000	6438000	I mean, seriously, we can all hope.
6438000	6440000	A long time.
6440000	6446000	Alright, before I get to my, uh, rapid fire stories here, I have to, DarkSakura, I see you chatting like crazy in our chat room tonight.
6446000	6454000	Did I read that right? You said, had I not romanced Garrus in all 17 times, you've beaten Mass Effect.
6454000	6457000	I think it's more than 17. I just made up a number.
6457000	6459000	You might have a problem.
6459000	6463000	No, I don't. Cause I've...
6463000	6465000	17? That's a lot.
6465000	6469000	Cause I do different stuff every time, except I always, uh, yeah.
6469000	6472000	Because, I'm sorry, all the other romances irritate the shit out of me.
6472000	6475000	No, no, no. I'm not even talking about the Garrus thing.
6475000	6479000	You've beaten the game 17 times. That's a lot of times to beat a game.
6479000	6484000	I don't think, but then again, I've seen the Rocky Horror Picture Show probably 400 times.
6484000	6487000	But I openly admit I have a problem there.
6487000	6493000	Keep in mind, I do a lot of character customization, like I played with the gift editor.
6493000	6499000	So I've probably actually beaten the game a bunch more times than I've done full playthroughs.
6499000	6501000	Justify, justify.
6501000	6505000	You know what? Shut up, Rob. Don't judge me, Mr. Abba Collection.
6505000	6509000	You have Bobby Blackwell from the chat room calling for an intervention.
6509000	6511000	It's like I'm walking on sunshine.
6511000	6514000	You know what? I'm gonna go play some Japanese Sonic Adventure.
6515000	6518000	Sonic CD. Just to spite Bobby.
6518000	6520000	I'll livestream that shit.
6520000	6523000	You have fun with that while I read the news about yet another Kickstarter.
6523000	6525000	This is the world we live in, guys, but this is a really cool band.
6525000	6527000	I know a lot of you like these guys.
6527000	6530000	Anna Manigucci, the Chiptune artist.
6530000	6534000	They have a Kickstarter of their own up for Endless Fantasy.
6534000	6539000	And they're very proud of the fact that they've completed this 22-track album over three years
6539000	6543000	without any help from a label, to which I say you guys go. That's awesome.
6543000	6547000	And the goal for this, getting the CD out there, $50,000, yeah.
6547000	6551000	They're sitting just under $200,000 right now, so safe to say they've met it.
6551000	6554000	Now with 13 days still to go.
6554000	6560000	So if you pay, I believe, $15,000 or more, you get the CD pre-order of Endless Fantasy
6560000	6562000	and you get the digital download with that.
6562000	6566000	And I know we have some of their tracks and rotation on VoG and great Chiptune artists.
6566000	6568000	So congrats, guys.
6569000	6572000	I don't know if this game would make $200,000, but it's sure worth a shot.
6572000	6576000	Shaq Fighter is apparently a name that has been trademarked.
6576000	6581000	Oh yes, I'm sure you all remember Shaq-Fu, which is what, on Super Nintendo and Genesis, I think, as well?
6581000	6584000	Yes, it was the fighting game that starred Shaq.
6584000	6587000	And it's kind of a cult game, but it's one of those games that everybody's like,
6587000	6592000	oh yeah, I remember Shaq-Fu, and then you actually play it, and you're like, oh yeah, I remember Shaq-Fu.
6592000	6596000	Well, there was also Shaq Down, which was a mobile game. They came out with that.
6597000	6605000	Well now, apparently, the folks that run the Shaq.com website, which I didn't even know existed until now,
6605000	6609000	they registered a trademark for Shaq Fighter on May 8th.
6609000	6612000	So I don't know if this is yet another mobile game.
6612000	6616000	Maybe this is the Wii U's killer app that's gonna get everybody to buy the console.
6616000	6618000	Or maybe it's another mobile game.
6618000	6623000	Or maybe it's another, like, attempt at a 50-cent Blood in the Sand.
6624000	6626000	Shaq goes after terrorists?
6626000	6633000	Perhaps, perhaps. I don't know. But hey, Shaq's pretty awesome, so this is gonna be, it's gonna be worth checking out,
6633000	6635000	if nothing else, but for the lolz.
6637000	6643000	Wave Forward, who did the game's Adventure Time, hey Ice King, why'd you steal our garbage?
6643000	6648000	And, of course, DuckTaled Remastered, which had everybody screaming like a little girl at PAX East,
6648000	6654000	is going to be doing another Adventure Time game.
6654000	6658000	It's called Adventure Time Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know.
6660000	6662000	I love Adventure Time.
6662000	6665000	Which is pretty much, you know, any video game ever, right?
6665000	6668000	Explore the Dungeon. Why? Because I don't know.
6668000	6673000	You will be exploring the secret royal dungeon underneath the Candy Kingdom.
6673000	6677000	And, of course, you can play as Finn, Jake, Marceline, and more.
6677000	6683000	There will be co-op as well. It's gonna be out Wii U, 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and 3DS.
6683000	6688000	I'm actually kind of excited about it because the last game was only 3DS, so it would be, oh, 3DS and DS.
6688000	6695000	Also happening, regular show, Mordecai and Rigby in 8-Bit Land on the 3DS.
6695000	6696000	It's Mordecai.
6696000	6700000	Mordecai, excuse me, I don't know this show, should I? Is it really funny?
6700000	6701000	It's supposed to be really funny.
6701000	6703000	I know Adventure Time, I know that one.
6703000	6705000	If you like Adventure Time, you'd like this show.
6706000	6711000	Is it one of those things that's, like, funnier if you've, you know, smoked a certain substance beforehand?
6711000	6714000	I think it's just the same type of humor as Adventure Time.
6714000	6715000	Okay, then yes.
6715000	6717000	Okay, so, um, don't do drugs, kids.
6717000	6722000	So, anyway, of course I meant smoking a hookah, which is perfectly legal.
6723000	6724000	Smoking meat.
6724000	6727000	Yes! Or water.
6727000	6728000	Let's see.
6728000	6729000	Smoking water.
6729000	6731000	Like a water bong, that's what I meant.
6731000	6737000	Anyhow, so as that name would talk about, the heroes will be transported inside your favorite games.
6737000	6741000	That's pretty much what you'd expect in an episode of regular show, anyway.
6741000	6743000	So, it's 8-Bit Land for the 3DS.
6743000	6748000	I guess they already have a game on iOS, which, you know, most things do, but...
6748000	6750000	I kind of assume that everything has a game on iOS.
6750000	6751000	There you go.
6751000	6755000	ActDef says, I like the show, lots and lots of 80s references.
6756000	6760000	Queen Simi on our chatroom says, regular show is more of a stoner, hipster show.
6760000	6762000	Just like I thought, huh? Huh?
6762000	6763000	There you go.
6763000	6764000	You know what I miss?
6764000	6765000	What?
6765000	6768000	Now that, you know, we're talking about shows with a lot of references and stuff.
6768000	6772000	I miss Code Monkeys, man. That was a good show on G4.
6773000	6774000	Like, one of the...
6774000	6775000	One of the few.
6775000	6776000	One of the few.
6776000	6777000	Yes.
6777000	6779000	Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6779000	6781000	Stuff.
6781000	6783000	You have to guess what it is. I'm just kidding.
6783000	6790000	Disney has registered some domains that means that they might be doing some type of racing game.
6790000	6798000	There's Disney Speedster, Disney Speedsters, Disney Racers, Disney Racing, Disney Kart, Disney Kart Racing, and Disney Karting.
6801000	6805000	They actually have a Disney Speedsters Twitter with no tweets on it yet.
6806000	6809000	So, not surprising. Disney has their fingers in most things.
6810000	6814000	Also, there is Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventure.
6815000	6820000	This is basically... It makes me think a lot of Pac-Land.
6821000	6822000	Do you remember?
6823000	6830000	But, like, on a 3D scale, and it's basically Pac-Man wandering around in a 3D world.
6830000	6831000	It looks neat.
6831000	6833000	It's also based off a new TV show.
6833000	6834000	What?
6834000	6835000	Yep.
6835000	6836000	What?
6836000	6839000	Now I need to go back and watch 80s Pac-Man cartoons.
6841000	6849000	And then, last but not least, Google did a tribute to Atari's Breakout by having...
6849000	6857000	If you type in Atari Breakout into the Google Images search, you will find your screen turned into a Breakout clone.
6859000	6862000	Another little Google Easter egg.
6862000	6868000	Yep. I actually... I super, super loved what Google did for Saw Bass's birthday.
6868000	6869000	Oh yeah, I saw that.
6869000	6875000	I was like... I just kept watching it over and over again, and then I had to watch It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.
6876000	6878000	Because that man is, like, my hero.
6878000	6880000	I'm sad he's dead.
6880000	6884000	Can you still play the Pac-Man... I remember the Pac-Man thing they did was legendary.
6884000	6885000	Can you still play that?
6885000	6886000	I can find out.
6886000	6889000	Didn't they leave that up on the internet somewhere, where you can, like, still play that?
6889000	6891000	Uh, yes.
6891000	6892000	Really?
6892000	6896000	Uh, yep. In fact, I will put the link into the chat room.
6896000	6900000	I might have to leave the show to go play more Pac-Man. Just kidding.
6900000	6901000	Although apparently they're...
6901000	6902000	Oh, sorry.
6903000	6906000	Apparently they're turning it into the new TV show anyway, so...
6906000	6907000	Yeah.
6907000	6909000	But anyway, you can still play that.
6909000	6912000	Let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
6912000	6914000	It's not here, Google.
6942000	6945000	And I'm going to read this from Travis H.
6952000	6955000	Oh, I didn't even read the damn question, did I? I'm sorry.
6955000	6962000	Well, I said it was going to be about the Nintendo Let's Play thing, but let me read to you what I said for the communities.
6972000	6977000	Or do you think they were well within their rights to make money off their game images?
6977000	6980000	And I linked to the story that, um, Loki talked about earlier in the show.
6980000	6985000	Alright, so now going back to Travis H.'s answer over on Google+,
6985000	6989000	with the majority of the gaming world hating on their new console,
6989000	6992000	and a lead developer from EA coming out last week calling the system crap,
6992000	6996000	I feel like the big N needs all the help and gamer love they can get.
6996000	6998000	I own a Wii U and a 3DS.
6998000	7001000	In my opinion, Nintendo is failing miserably.
7001000	7004000	They need to focus more on making some damn games for the Wii U
7004000	7007000	and stop bitching about free advertisement and promotion of their games.
7007000	7010000	As for the content and spoiler aspect of the videos,
7010000	7016000	if you don't want to watch the game content spoiled for yourself, here is a novel idea.
7016000	7020000	Don't watch. Hashtag Wake Up Nintendo.
7020000	7025000	And that is a very similar thing that I've read on many places on the internet this week.
7025000	7029000	Do you feel the same way about Microsoft? Just making sure. I'm assuming you do.
7029000	7032000	Reading some of the other answers here, I'm going to go to Facebook,
7032000	7038000	and I'm purposely being a little picky choosy from names I don't see in chat and mailbag and other places,
7038000	7041000	but I do encourage everybody to go read all of the answers.
7041000	7043000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
7043000	7046000	I'll read this one. Vince from AKVG Games.
7046000	7049000	I'm a person that loves making and watching Let's Plays.
7049000	7051000	Somebody that actually does Let's Play videos.
7051000	7054000	I neither disagree or agree with Nintendo.
7055000	7060000	Yes, LPs can be a gain or take on sales depending on how a certain game of theirs is handled be,
7060000	7062000	so does reviews and articles.
7062000	7065000	Theirs is handled, be it...
7065000	7069000	This was typed via mobile, so I'm thinking AutoCorrect really fucked with that sentence there,
7069000	7072000	but I think it's depending on how a certain game of theirs is handled,
7072000	7076000	but so do reviews and articles.
7076000	7081000	It's a tough topic, really, because we don't really know if Nintendo is right or wrong with making this decision.
7081000	7084000	I guess for now, if you want to make a living off Nintendo long plays,
7084000	7087000	you'll have to contact Nintendo and work something out with them.
7087000	7092000	At least you're still able to do them and not disappear from the internet like other companies do...
7092000	7094000	Sega.
7095000	7098000	Chiggers asked, what's a Let's Play video?
7098000	7100000	Was that tongue in cheek? I'm not sure.
7100000	7102000	Going to Zether.
7102000	7106000	Zether says, Let's Play videos are not meant to be something to be monetized.
7106000	7109000	They are meant to be playthroughs of games with insightful commentary,
7109000	7112000	or text in the case of screenshot Let's Plays,
7112000	7115000	that the person who did them put their heart and soul into.
7115000	7119000	I have followed long plays from both Something Awful, where the concept originated,
7119000	7122000	and from users on YouTube who aren't members of Something Awful,
7122000	7125000	people who didn't want to join YouTube for the money,
7125000	7131000	and they were fun to watch, as opposed to most of the YouTube partners who do game long plays for the cash,
7131000	7133000	like PewDiePie.
7133000	7137000	Even people like ChuggaConroy who play Nintendo games are not in it for the money.
7137000	7142000	Nintendo is doing the right thing, and frankly, these people deserve what's coming to them.
7142000	7144000	That's a pretty pointed answer.
7144000	7146000	Let's see.
7146000	7152000	Andy R. says, I don't watch Let's Plays myself, but the news did solely my opinion of Nintendo a bit.
7152000	7156000	At least among the couple of people I know who do their own Let's Plays,
7156000	7158000	they're not trying to profit off the content.
7158000	7162000	They just want to provide entertainment and to share something they love with others.
7162000	7165000	Benjamin H. actually replied to that and said,
7165000	7169000	Andy, those LPs can still provide entertainment and share something they love.
7169000	7173000	If they're not trying to profit from the Nintendo-based content,
7173000	7177000	are they really going to be majorly affected by Nintendo trying to profit from it?
7177000	7182000	Underleveled Video replies and says, I do Let's Plays.
7182000	7186000	I only monetize the videos that the publisher of the game has said it's okay to monetize.
7186000	7188000	Blizzard, Minecraft, etc.
7188000	7191000	They don't care because they see it as free advertising for them.
7191000	7197000	Several indie game developers have gone on record to say if it hadn't been for people playing their game on YouTube,
7197000	7200000	they never would have sold as many copies as they did.
7200000	7205000	In an ideal world, I think the ad revenue generated should be split between the game developer and the YouTuber,
7205000	7209000	but perfect worlds are impossible in this money-grubbing existence.
7209000	7211000	Interesting, because I suggested the same thing earlier.
7211000	7225000	Once again, I'm just confused that the amount of money that they're generating per each video is so small that you really think that,
7225000	7229000	I don't know, it just seems kind of, I understand it's your property or whatever,
7229000	7237000	and you're mad at people making money off of it because they like your property and they want to show people stuff.
7237000	7242000	I mean, it's not like they're putting out a DVD or something with your game on it and saying,
7242000	7245000	oh, this is my game. It's just, I don't know.
7245000	7250000	Alright, let me finish the comment here from underleveled video because I think the end of it is very interesting.
7250000	7254000	It really is a gray area, though, in copyright and fair use.
7254000	7260000	Nintendo owns the game, but the YouTuber owns their actions in said game as well as their commentary on top of the video.
7260000	7264000	I think a court case needs to happen to make legal precedent.
7264000	7266000	That's a scary thought.
7266000	7268000	Is it really going to come to that?
7268000	7274000	It might. Not in Nintendo's case, but maybe another company.
7274000	7283000	It could be something like, you know, where they use that content ID system and they overreach their balance and ban an account that's made a lot of money on something.
7283000	7288000	They've done that. Was it Angry Game Nerd or whatever got his channel taken down one time?
7288000	7294000	Well, to be fair, again, I just want to be clear, Nintendo is not doing the strike thing against the people.
7294000	7299000	They were very clear and they tried to make themselves look like the good guys in the comments saying,
7299000	7306000	hey, we didn't do what certain other entertainment companies are doing and we're just switching the monetization thing, basically.
7306000	7310000	We're not actually doing copyright strikes that will get your channel taken down.
7310000	7316000	But in the eyes of people who are thinking they're being the big asshole, being less of an asshole doesn't make you not an asshole.
7316000	7323000	Yeah, exactly. I mean, I understand that they're doing the thing or whatever, that they're not taking down videos.
7323000	7331000	But at the same time, they could also be like Minecraft and Blizzard and say, hey, it's cool that you guys show videos of our games.
7331000	7337000	So, yes, I understand that they can take down games, but the fact that they're taking all the ad revenue from it is still kind of a dick move.
7337000	7342000	Alright, I want to read one more here. I think this is a very interesting response.
7342000	7350000	It's kind of, you know, we've heard a lot of people that are very supportive of what Nintendo's doing and this one is kind of going the other direction that supports the Let's Players a little more.
7350000	7352000	So let me read this. It's from Jeff B.
7372000	7378000	A quality LP is work, is a part-time job's pay, or enough for one nice dinner at a month.
7378000	7384000	Honestly, it doesn't even really matter whether Nintendo was legally or morally justified because it was bad business no matter how you slice it.
7384000	7390000	And I imagine this problem for Nintendo will diminish quickly as they continue to copyright claim people's LP videos.
7390000	7399000	When Nintendo started this, they had to have known it'd stop Let's Play videos of their own games getting made by a good chunk of the people putting out quality game content on YouTube.
7399000	7406000	That's free advertising that Nintendo's own most loyal community does that gets more of their games sold.
7406000	7413000	If Nintendo wants to nickel and dime, literally nickel and dime in some cases, some of their best community ambassadors, they can go right ahead.
7413000	7418000	I'm sure they're legally clear to do that, but maybe they should think twice about turning on their own fans.
7418000	7422000	I welcome them to come over to Twitch and try the same advertising revenue claim.
7422000	7425000	And honestly, I'm starting to hope Twitch caves.
7425000	7430000	It means no partners will be streaming newer Nintendo games. More room for League of Legends streams.
7430000	7432000	Just kidding, I hate League of Legends.
7432000	7439000	Someday, Nintendo will realize that giving people access to your game in nearly any way you can, not taking it away, brings in sales.
7439000	7445000	And by doing this on YouTube, they are indirectly taking access away because the community will stop showcasing their games.
7446000	7452000	So, very much saying that, you know, these guys are doing you a favor, and Nintendo, you are, I'm kind of summarizing in my own words,
7452000	7456000	Nintendo, you are going to lose a lot of support on this.
7456000	7461000	I found the tangent on Twitch interesting, though.
7461000	7467000	I'm not sure what the point, I have to be honest, I'm not sure what the point was you were trying to make with that.
7467000	7472000	Because, does that mean you want Nintendo to go over to Twitch, and you want Twitch to cave on that?
7472000	7477000	Oh, I see, because then, no more newer Nintendo games on Twitch.
7477000	7482000	But, why would you want that to happen, if you hate League of Legends?
7482000	7490000	I think it's just saying, you know, it would show them, even if they get rid of YouTube videos of Nintendo games.
7490000	7498000	And how old are we going here? Are we talking about like, if I have a NES Super Mario Let's Play or something like that, they're going to monetize that?
7498000	7505000	Because that right there, they're trying to sell virtual console games, and people don't know what the hell this game is, and they look up a Let's Play video for it,
7505000	7508000	and they're like, hey, that looks kind of cool, I'm going to buy that game.
7508000	7514000	Because they don't have demos for those games, even though they really should find a way to do that.
7514000	7520000	Hello, I mean, we're 2013, you can't fucking figure out how to make a demo for a game?
7520000	7526000	Why aren't you getting people to your website where the YouTube is posted, make money off your website?
7527000	7529000	There's something I'm not...
7529000	7534000	Because it's automatic. It's automatic. Because ad revenue is automatic.
7534000	7539000	That's just like, you know, why put ads on your website? It's the same thing.
7539000	7544000	What if I have Nintendo content on my website, and I'm making ad revenue through those same ads?
7544000	7555000	Literally, it's the same ads that you're getting through, it's all the Google Analytics stuff, so it's kind of a work around, I guess.
7555000	7557000	But, I don't know.
7557000	7563000	I honestly think that the money part of it is a smaller factor than them trying to control content.
7563000	7569000	Because, I mean, think about it, you've got basically unsolicited advertising coming up, yeah,
7569000	7572000	but it may not be exactly what Nintendo wants to see out there.
7572000	7579000	Maybe that is a work around, you know, you make a private video, you have some sort of, in fact, hey, someone could even get on this bandwagon,
7579000	7585000	they have some sort of service where it creates a webpage for you that you go to to watch this video,
7585000	7590000	almost like a URL redirector or shortener or something like that,
7590000	7596000	and look, there's ad content on there through Google Analytics, but you're still making money, but you just don't have an advertisement on the video.
7596000	7597000	There you go.
7597000	7602000	But then they're going to figure out that that's a work around, and they're going to come down on you anyways.
7602000	7604000	Because people don't like loopholes.
7605000	7609000	People love loopholes, companies don't.
7609000	7615000	There's some of the answers, again, because a lot of these were lengthy and I only have a little bit of time,
7615000	7619000	I did not want to read all of them, but I encourage you guys to go read them for yourselves.
7619000	7624000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, also Google Plus, there was another answer over there.
7624000	7627000	Search for Orange Lounge Radio on Google Plus.
7627000	7630000	I would give you all the numbers, but you'd forget.
7631000	7634000	Alright, let's do a few more news stories.
7634000	7638000	And boy, another kick Nintendo story, right, Logie?
7638000	7641000	Yes, I love kicking them when they're down.
7641000	7646000	No, seriously though, but I've been saying this for months now, that EA has no games for the Wii U.
7646000	7649000	Numerous shows have said that.
7649000	7655000	And yes, it's only been confirmed by EA that yes, they don't have any games coming up for the Wii U.
7655000	7662000	And I think a lot of that has to do with, they're pushing to do the Frostbite 3 engine for a lot of their games,
7662000	7664000	including, I think, sports games.
7664000	7667000	And Frostbite 3 does not work on the Wii U.
7667000	7675000	Or basically, they just don't want to make it work on the Wii U because they are developing a new Frostbite engine for mobile.
7675000	7682000	So, in theory, they could create a Frostbite 2.5 or something like that that runs on Wii U and just have to port it over.
7682000	7686000	It's just not worth it to them to do that because they're not making any money off of it.
7686000	7692000	For example, FIFA 14 is not coming to the Wii U because FIFA 13 sales were not very good.
7692000	7698000	Although, that's not a really good comparison because FIFA 13 was just FIFA 12 but reskinned with a roster update.
7698000	7701000	Literally, that's what it was on the Wii U.
7701000	7704000	So, whatever.
7704000	7706000	But that's the case, I think, with a lot of these companies.
7706000	7710000	They're not porting their games to the Wii U because it's just not making any sense.
7710000	7716000	And one of these games that was a big part of E3, their presentation was Ghost Recon Online.
7716000	7719000	Still on hold, even though it was supposed to be coming out.
7719000	7723000	When is it coming out? We haven't heard anything since like a year ago.
7723000	7725000	I don't know.
7725000	7728000	Let me ask a question here.
7728000	7732000	Is EA still making games for the PlayStation Vita?
7732000	7735000	FIFA is the only game that they have for the Vita.
7735000	7738000	Everything else is just PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
7738000	7741000	So there is at least something that they're making for the Vita.
7741000	7743000	See, I find that interesting.
7743000	7746000	Because I think the Vita is in a very similar boat to the Wii U.
7746000	7749000	It's just a lot of people kind of forgot that the Vita is also struggling.
7749000	7752000	So that tells me there's something else at play here.
7752000	7757000	I don't think it's necessarily like EA has it out for Nintendo or whatever.
7757000	7763000	I've also heard the theory about maybe a botched relationship with Origin on Nintendo or whatever.
7763000	7766000	Which actually might be part of it.
7766000	7772000	But I think it's more in general an inability on Nintendo's part to grasp online.
7772000	7778000	And I think, for one, the online pass system couldn't be implemented on the Nintendo.
7778000	7781000	Which was a problem, I think, for EA in some regards.
7781000	7784000	Because you don't see it in Mass Effect, in the Mass Effect game.
7784000	7789000	Well, you don't see it in Mass Effect, but is it on Assassin's Creed 3?
7789000	7791000	Because wouldn't that have Uplay on it?
7791000	7794000	Uplay is on Wii U because it's in Zombie U.
7795000	7800000	Okay, but there's a whole little separate Uplay channel that you can download and all this stuff on the Wii U as well.
7800000	7801000	Why can't there be an Origin channel?
7801000	7802000	Why not?
7802000	7810000	But what I think is, I think there's something about the online store and its inability to do what EA wants.
7810000	7814000	When it comes to a lot of the DLC, when it comes to the online passes.
7814000	7819000	I mean, think about it. None of the Mass Effect 3 DLC ever came to Nintendo.
7819000	7822000	None of it. Not the free stuff or the paid stuff.
7822000	7825000	Only the stuff that they were able to put on the disc.
7825000	7827000	Like the extended cut.
7827000	7829000	Did, um...
7829000	7835000	Now that I think of it too, did any of the DLC come out for Black Ops 2 on the Wii U?
7835000	7837000	I'm not sure it did.
7837000	7839000	So there's something weird there.
7839000	7841000	And to me, that's the problem.
7841000	7843000	And I don't think it's...
7843000	7847000	I don't really buy the whole, they can't do it, or it's...
7848000	7856000	I think that there's not as much money to be made, not because there's a lower adoption of Wii U's or whatever.
7856000	7860000	Because if they're still making games for the Vita, then that's not the only problem.
7860000	7862000	But the Vita, it's very easy to incorporate.
7862000	7865000	You know, it works just like the Playstation 3 with all the DLC.
7865000	7872000	So I think there's something, I think there's something with that is the real reason why EA is not continuing to put games out there.
7872000	7876000	Because it doesn't match their vision of being able to nickel and dime you online.
7876000	7881000	And possibly whatever is coming after this online pass, maybe Wii U can't do.
7885000	7887000	Think I might be onto something? Maybe?
7887000	7889000	Maybe.
7890000	7893000	But I think it also doesn't help that they don't have that many consoles out there.
7893000	7897000	And to do a dedicated port for the Wii U, it's just not cost effective for them.
7897000	7898000	They're not gonna have...
7898000	7900000	So why are they doing it for the Vita?
7900000	7904000	Maybe the FIFA sold a lot more on the Vita than we know.
7904000	7908000	Maybe that was a game that is consistently selling on the Vita.
7908000	7911000	I don't know. I don't really know what the sales numbers are on the Vita.
7911000	7913000	Because it is something that's worldwide.
7913000	7918000	You know, FIFA is a really big game worldwide, so maybe that happened.
7918000	7922000	Or maybe they're just gonna take the easy way out and just take the game from last year.
7922000	7927000	And once again, you know, just update the roster and just release a really half-assed game.
7927000	7928000	That's true, they might.
7928000	7934000	So, I guess they could have done that with the Wii U, but I don't know.
7935000	7937000	Just release the Wii version?
7937000	7939000	Well no, the Wii U version. Just release it again.
7939000	7942000	But just skin it and just update the rosters.
7942000	7944000	Very interesting.
7944000	7948000	So, was that it in your little blog? Oh yeah, there you go.
7948000	7952000	So, let's move on to some news out of Google this week.
7952000	7956000	Google had their whole little, what was it called, the IO conference or something like that.
7956000	7959000	And they announced some changes coming to Google Maps.
7959000	7965000	They talked about some of the hangouts and Google Plus they talked a lot about.
7965000	7971000	One of the things they talked about on Google Plus is that there will no longer be Google Plus games after June 30th.
7971000	7976000	In fact, if you actually go to Google Plus games right now, they say they are no longer going to be available after June 30th.
7976000	7983000	If you want to be able to transfer your game progress or your little microtransactions or whatever from the game,
7983000	7985000	you gotta take that up with the original publisher.
7985000	7994000	So, that is going away. Possibly to make room for this, it's a game services, it's part of Google Play,
7994000	8001000	a game service that's going to launch out of the Play Store that will link together mobile, social, and cloud gaming.
8001000	8005000	And I seem to remember they were showing like a demo that showed one guy playing on the web,
8005000	8007000	one playing on a phone, and one on a tablet or something.
8007000	8009000	They're all linked together.
8009000	8014000	So, I'm assuming Google Plus games, I mean, let's be real, they probably were not that popular in the first place
8014000	8017000	because Google Plus did not catch on the way, you know, Facebook did.
8017000	8021000	It's popular, it's cultish, but it's not mainstream, right?
8021000	8025000	So, the games aren't catching on, so now they got this instead.
8025000	8029000	They're saying it's going to be different from Apple and what they do with Game Center
8029000	8035000	because there will be back-end support and this is not going to be just a stand-alone application.
8035000	8040000	Anyone making a game with Google Play has access to the developer services.
8040000	8048000	Some games will have this incorporated already, like World of Goo, Kingdom Rush, Beach Buggy Blitz, Osmose, and so forth.
8048000	8055000	It's not mandatory. There's no certification process. Interesting.
8055000	8058000	And it's cross-platform, which is wonderful.
8058000	8067000	They showed on one of the demos, it was like a tech demo, this racing game where they had all these different tablets and phones and stuff next to each other
8067000	8076000	and it created a racetrack, like a slot car racing thing, but it was cross-platform, cross-device, and it all worked flawlessly.
8076000	8084000	Yeah, so my thought is that they'll probably incorporate this at some point into Google Plus where it's like play the game on the web or something like that, you know?
8084000	8092000	So, it's just kind of an evolution of that, which sounds a lot cooler than like Facebook games, you know?
8092000	8094000	Anything sounds better than Facebook games.
8094000	8100000	If I get one more fucking invite for Candy Crush Saga, I'm gonna cut somebody.
8100000	8104000	Being stabbed in the eye is better than... not really.
8104000	8107000	Slightly better than Facebook games.
8107000	8109000	Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
8109000	8112000	I've got some stuff. How about Nintendo stuff?
8112000	8118000	Basically, Nintendo won an appeal to keep selling the Wii in the US.
8119000	8126000	Basically, there was a whole litigation about Motiva, is that how it's pronounced?
8126000	8132000	Saying that the Wii had infringed on two of its patents to track body position and body movement,
8132000	8139000	but the judges agreed that their motive was just to win damages or a settlement, not for licensing.
8139000	8144000	So, they said no, and Nintendo won.
8145000	8151000	So, Nintendo can keep selling the Wii, even though they should be trying to get that thing off shelves
8151000	8154000	and try to make people buy Wii U instead, right?
8154000	8159000	No, I think they should just give up on the Wii U and actually put out a system.
8159000	8164000	I think it's too early. I don't understand why everybody's like,
8164000	8167000	Wii U's dead and it's only been nine months.
8167000	8169000	Again, 3DS, same thing.
8169000	8175000	If we're sitting here after the holidays, still saying the same story, then we can call the Wii U dead,
8175000	8177000	but I'm not ready to say that yet.
8177000	8186000	I mean, I'm not saying it's dead, but it really is highly underperforming for a Nintendo system.
8186000	8191000	I mean, you remember how Hyper Everyone was about the Wii, and then the Wii U comes out,
8191000	8194000	and I'm still finding them no problem, like piles of them.
8194000	8197000	The 3DS was a Nintendo system, and it was the same story.
8197000	8199000	It sold better than the Wii U.
8199000	8200000	Did it?
8200000	8201000	I think it did.
8201000	8203000	I think it, yeah, it's selling better than the...
8203000	8205000	Well, it's definitely selling better than the Wii U right now.
8205000	8206000	Well, okay, but...
8206000	8208000	Time frame, I'm not sure.
8208000	8210000	The price to get one was also half as much.
8210000	8212000	Yeah.
8212000	8215000	Less than a Wii U, for sure, so...
8215000	8218000	Well, it was $250.
8218000	8224000	Well, and think about it this way, too, you know, having a home console is a lot more,
8224000	8227000	I think, of a commitment than having a handheld system.
8227000	8233000	And with a handheld system, you have the advantage of it being just that, something you can carry around with you.
8233000	8238000	But I think with the 3DS, too, I mean, look at it this way, they had a gimmick that was interesting.
8238000	8245000	It was a 3D display without any 3D glasses, and that was like, whoa, that's a neat thing,
8245000	8249000	versus the Wii U with, A, it's a tablet controller.
8249000	8256000	People are used to playing with tablet controllers, or tablets, so that's not, like, it wasn't that big of a new thing,
8256000	8262000	but 3D graphics without, you know, glasses, that was like, holy crap, even if, you know, no one uses it anymore.
8262000	8266000	Well, there's phones that do the same thing, now Dan's old Galaxy did.
8268000	8269000	I don't know, I...
8269000	8270000	The lenticular screen?
8270000	8274000	I'm just not still willing to say it's dead at this point.
8274000	8283000	But I will say, I think one big mistake they made is that they made that touchpad was really a step back to where, you know, touch gaming is at right now.
8283000	8287000	Like the whole having to use a stylus, or I mean, I guess you don't have to for some games,
8287000	8291000	but it really should have been as good of a touch, you know, as modern tablets and so forth.
8291000	8297000	Because, yeah, people do know a tablet, and they expect it to respond a lot better to touch than Nintendo's tablet does.
8297000	8302000	For the record, Dan said that his phone that had the lenticular screen was the Thrill.
8302000	8303000	Hmm.
8303000	8305000	So it was in his Galaxy.
8305000	8309000	It was still kind of neat, though. It gave me the same type of headache the 3DS does.
8309000	8319000	So are we going to have them release, like, a Wii U with Tablet Plus that's going to have multi-touch on it, and it's going to be an upgrade of what it, you know, like they did with Wii Remote Plus?
8319000	8320000	I hope not.
8320000	8328000	I still would like to see some more games for the system I have, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's a place we end up next year.
8328000	8334000	But I think this year is all about, like, this is not a year to release any hardware.
8334000	8340000	Maybe that whole Wii Fit thing, which I'm sure is one of the games they're going to be pushing for the holidays,
8340000	8350000	that is a little bit different because that's an add-on with a very specific purpose, but this is not the year to be pushing hardware for the Wii U or anything in the living room.
8350000	8353000	Like, it will really alienate the people that have supported the system.
8354000	8362000	Didn't make me happy that the Circle Pad Pro came out either, but at the same time, they didn't, like, what, four games use it?
8362000	8368000	So, anyway. Alright, let's move on. Loki.
8368000	8376000	Alright. So, you know, Ouya. I was joking about this on Bobby's show.
8377000	8386000	Ouya is going to be at E3. Well, at E3 in proximity to E3. They're going to be in a parking lot outside of E3. In a van.
8386000	8387000	Down by the river?
8387000	8394000	By the river, yeah. No, actually, they're going to be in the parking lot, and they're going to be, you know, they basically said,
8394000	8399000	Everything you need to put on the killer game demo. Ouya console, controllers, and TV.
8399000	8412000	That's not how you put on a killer game demo. I mean, because, granted, there are a lot of games, I mean, there's games on the Wii U or the Ouya, but not all of them are like,
8412000	8416000	Hey, buy me, because this game is on there. I mean, no-
8416000	8419000	Although they could show that parking game with no brake.
8419000	8420000	Parking game is awesome.
8420000	8421000	No brake parking.
8421000	8431000	What I want to know is how they're going to fix my controller, because my controller is all fucked up, and apparently the newer consoles that are shipping out have a fixed controller.
8431000	8439000	So, where do I RMA that bitch, because I want a controller where the analogs fucking work. You know, I think that's expected.
8439000	8447000	So what if I backed your console, you fucked up on something, and it needs to be fixed. So, that's why I'm concerned.
8447000	8449000	Anyways, yeah, if they're going to be there-
8449000	8451000	Well, you could go down to the Staples Center and ask.
8451000	8453000	No, I'm not driving down there for that shit.
8453000	8455000	If I go, I'll ask.
8455000	8457000	And they probably won't know either.
8457000	8462000	I still don't know if I've been blessed by the E3 Pope or not, so I'm still figuring that whole thing out.
8462000	8467000	But I will try to stop by. But it should be noted that there are many parking lots around the convention center.
8467000	8475000	This is likely the same lot that Saints Row the Third used last year, which is across the street from Staples Center, which got even more exposure,
8475000	8480000	because, hey, it was right during the time when the Lakers were in the playoffs last year when E3 was going on.
8480000	8485000	Or was it last year or two years ago? No, it was last year. So, even extra exposure, right?
8485000	8487000	Yeah.
8487000	8489000	Anyhow.
8489000	8500000	Well, Konami talk in E3, or at least a pre-E3 show, and they've been doing this kind of, they've been doing like the Nintendo Direct thing for a little while, too.
8500000	8502000	They do these videos that go out.
8502000	8509000	So, Konami will be doing a pre-E3 show that will give the latest on some of their franchises on June 6th.
8509000	8516000	This is the third year that they've done it. Notice how, I think the last time they did it was when Rock Revolution came out.
8516000	8521000	Or the last time they did a live presentation, rather. And that was a hot mess.
8521000	8524000	So, yeah, now they do these videos that are all pre-done instead.
8524000	8534000	So, June 6th, 1pm Eastern, which will be streaming live online through Konami's event site, also on GameSpot, also through Xbox Live and the GameSpot app.
8534000	8540000	New trailers for Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2, which was also seen last year.
8540000	8542000	A year before last, I think.
8542000	8548000	But also, Metal Gear Solid 5, which I'm sure some people are very excited about. The Phantom Pain.
8548000	8550000	Snake is even older.
8550000	8556000	Yes, that will be there as well, and I'm sure there will be some other unannounced goodies, too.
8556000	8559000	And I know we have some long-time Bomani fans who still listen to the show.
8559000	8565000	I would not go in anticipating anything as far as the Beat games go, but you never know.
8565000	8575000	If the new Xbox has this Kinect thing built in, maybe they'll try the Rhythm Party thing again, or Dance Masters.
8575000	8580000	I don't think Dance Masters did very well. But Rhythm Party was just on sale over the weekend. It might still be, actually.
8580000	8586000	If you don't have Rhythm Party and you like Bomani games, and you have a Kinect, Rhythm Party's not bad.
8586000	8590000	The problem is, there's only like five songs in the base game. It's all DLC.
8590000	8596000	But it's pretty well put together. They should have just made it a disc game with a well-rounded 50 songs. It would have been awesome.
8596000	8601000	But, anyway. So, I don't know. I wouldn't hold my breath as far as music games go, though.
8601000	8608000	I don't think you're gonna see BeatMania 2DX or anything. I don't know. Just call it a hunch. I think a lot of that stuff is long gone.
8608000	8615000	I don't know what the heck they would be putting out then, because they don't really have anything other than Castlevania. That's all I know.
8615000	8618000	Pro Evo, I guess, would be another Pro Evo game.
8618000	8621000	It could be another Silent Hill entry.
8621000	8622000	Nah, I don't think so.
8622000	8623000	It's about time for one of those, isn't it?
8623000	8625000	I don't think there's gonna be one of those this year.
8625000	8626000	You never know.
8627000	8634000	Alright. Let's go on to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8634000	8637000	And DarkSakura dives into the email bag head first.
8637000	8642000	And tries not to catch anything as she's pulling out your emails to read here on the show.
8643000	8644000	DarkSakura!
8645000	8647000	Why don't you read some emails for us?
8647000	8651000	Okay. We have three. Three whole emails.
8652000	8658000	The first one, Dear OLR, A very belated congratulations on your achievement of reaching 500 plus episodes.
8658000	8659000	Excuse me.
8659000	8663000	Thanks for being there with me on so many long drives to work and back.
8663000	8668000	I wish that I could join you on live shows more often, but family commitments usually conflict with that.
8668000	8675000	I have been listening to you since before my son was even born six years ago, who is now old enough to game with me.
8675000	8677000	Thank you for making me feel old.
8677000	8678000	Right?
8678000	8679000	Seriously.
8679000	8687000	With the new next box being announced this week, I continue to be very excited about gaming even though I miss the days of the arcade.
8687000	8691000	Or days gone by of trying to finish games we rented from the local video store.
8691000	8699000	Sometimes I feel that gamers today are very jaded considering there is a gamut of options out there on every imaginable platform.
8699000	8702000	The constant complaints can often be disheartening.
8702000	8703000	I agree with that.
8704000	8711000	I was like, man, we had games that we could only get from Blockbuster that were really hard and had no save function and we liked it.
8714000	8715000	Seriously.
8715000	8720000	Anywho, this topic is about appreciation and I wanted to show mine to you with a small token.
8720000	8722000	Keep up the great work, Dark Charger.
8726000	8729000	Well, I'll go ahead and read it because it's kind of long.
8729000	8731000	It's up to you if you want to read the rest of this on the internet.
8731000	8737000	I'm hoping Dark Soccer since she's unemployed or someone OLR can use this license either for the show or even just to enjoy.
8737000	8739000	You're welcome to keep it or give it away as you please.
8739000	8740000	Oh my god.
8742000	8744000	A one year subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud.
8746000	8752000	Yeah, I saw that in the email bag earlier this week and I was like, oh boy, Dark Soccer is going to be pretty excited about that.
8752000	8755000	I just, I need new underwear, please.
8755000	8758000	If she doesn't want it, then I would like to get the new audition.
8758000	8760000	That would be great for podcasts.
8760000	8773000	Yeah, but a very, very generous donation and I'm always amazed by the generosity of our listeners.
8773000	8783000	Just in being here and participating and even when there's free stuff like this to come out of it and a lot of that stuff will go right back into helping the show and vlog.
8784000	8790000	Well, given that I'm doing all of the graphics for the site and everything, yeah, I think I have a use for this.
8790000	8793000	So, yeah, very cool.
8793000	8795000	Excuse me, I'm actually tearing up a little bit now.
8795000	8796000	Are you really?
8796000	8797000	Just a little bit.
8797000	8798000	Can you cry on air?
8798000	8799000	No, I won't cry on air.
8799000	8802000	I cried on air when we got a gift once. Why can't you cry on air?
8802000	8804000	You've cried on air.
8804000	8807000	I have cried on air, probably more than once, but anyhow.
8807000	8813000	I usually just cry from wank, but this is actually like, oh my god, it's super, super awesome.
8813000	8819000	So, again, thank you. It's amazing. You really didn't have to. And I know that shit ain't cheap.
8819000	8828000	Like, you might have had an in or whatever, but I really hope you did not have to pay a lot of money for that. That's something else.
8828000	8833000	Isn't the current CS Suite something like a good $700?
8834000	8842000	Well, I know that when I tried to get the student edition for CS6, it was like $300, and I'm still using 5.1.
8842000	8846000	So, I'm feeling verklempt.
8846000	8848000	Are you okay to go to the next one?
8848000	8853000	Talk amongst yourselves. I'll give you a topic. No, I'm ready to go on.
8853000	8854000	All right.
8854000	8859000	I'm just a little floored right now, and probably Sinus Medicine has something to do with that, too.
8859000	8860000	Okay.
8860000	8872000	Dear OLR, after a two-week vacation, I came back to find my Wii U game pad was left on in TV remote controller mode the entire time plus a day, or 360 hours straight.
8872000	8878000	It responded when I turned it off, and I later started the Wii U to see if I had burn-in on the pad. Nope.
8878000	8885000	It was plugged in the whole time, or it would have turned itself off. That's a good argument for unplugging it while playing, and that's from Rababa.
8885000	8888000	Interesting. That's a long time to leave that thing on.
8888000	8895000	I thought that thing was only supposed to work for like three hours, but I guess maybe because the remote doesn't really use the transmitter functions.
8895000	8896000	That's crazy.
8896000	8898000	Well, he said it was plugged in.
8898000	8901000	Oh, it's plugged in. Oh, okay.
8901000	8907000	Yeah, but on top of that, though, not having any burn-in is... I'm sorry, I'm still a little floored by the other thing.
8907000	8908000	That's all right.
8908000	8911000	Not having burn-in is actually pretty amazing.
8912000	8922000	I remember, of course, this was 19 years ago, earlier than that, having Samurai Shodown 3 and the big screen having burn-in after a week.
8922000	8928000	I remember the Apple IIe monitors were really susceptible to burn-in. You had to be careful.
8928000	8933000	Oh, yeah, you had that little icon in the corner forever that was your computer icon.
8933000	8936000	Yeah, it lived there. It never went away.
8937000	8945000	But that's pretty impressive. That's actually a really good sign of a quality product. Okay, I won't rag on the Wii U that much anymore.
8945000	8946000	Yeah, I will.
8946000	8947000	Yeah, you will. Don't lie.
8947000	8950000	Yeah, you know me. I'm a hater.
8950000	8953000	Liars don't get codes for software.
8954000	8966000	Okay, so we have one more email, and this person does not give us a name, so I'm just going to say Kirk, which is the first name attached to this.
8966000	8976000	Good evening, my OLR peeps. My name is Kirk, and I wanted to email you guys and say that for about six to eight months, I was taking a break from console gaming and listening to gaming podcasts.
8977000	8986000	Your show is one of my gaming podcasts I would listen to on a regular basis, and even though I couldn't make it to the livestreams, I've been a loyal listener for many years. Oh, we love you.
8986000	8996000	But this past year, I decided to be a real adult, which leads me to buying my first home, going back to school to finish my degree, and finally working on those New Year resolutions of losing weight.
8996000	8999000	I currently have lost 121 pounds. That's like losing a supermodel.
8999000	9000000	That's crazy.
9000000	9001000	Yeah.
9001000	9010000	I just want to say, though, with all due respect, I think that's great that you have those priorities, but I don't own a home, I don't have a degree from college, and I'm fat.
9010000	9012000	You are not fat, Rob.
9012000	9020000	I still feel like an adult, so I'm just saying, you don't have to have those things. I understand the point the listener was trying to make.
9020000	9025000	You are not fat, Rob. Just saying.
9026000	9036000	Okay. With being occupied with all those things along with a full-time job, gaming fell by the wayside, and I've given up my PS3, Xbox 360, 3DS, and listening to gaming podcasts.
9036000	9045000	Things have settled down recently this year with me adjusting to my new townhouse, except for the noisy neighbors, and keeping a regular routine with school and gym time.
9045000	9047000	I've gotten back into gaming.
9047000	9056000	For the first time in my life, I built my own gaming PC piece by piece, and I am now back exclusively as a PC gamer addicted to Steam sales and getting used to WASD.
9056000	9059000	Yeah, Steam sales. Superdicting.
9059000	9066000	With my glorious return to gaming, I'm also happily back to listening to my favorite podcasts, which yours is first on the list.
9066000	9067000	Aw.
9067000	9079000	On My Favorite Hobbies was listening to you while listening to podcasts in the background, and I wanted to say thank you for entertaining me for so many years, and I'm glad to be back as a loyal listener.
9079000	9081000	Well, we are glad to have you back.
9081000	9085000	Aw, this fat homeless dropout is so happy to have you here.
9085000	9087000	I had to, sorry.
9087000	9089000	You know what?
9089000	9101000	I get the real point. Sometimes, in order to make change happen in your life, you have to change some things. So, I get the point.
9101000	9112000	If you have one thing that is becoming so distracting to the point that you can't get anything else done, then yeah, I can understand taking a full step away from it to reorganize.
9112000	9115000	Exactly, and that's what sometimes people have to do.
9115000	9126000	I've done the same thing myself. I mean, you remember when I went Momo-free for a while, you know, especially since WoW kind of sucked at first. Sorry, sorry, sorry, hate.
9126000	9132000	But I mean, some people need to do that. It's like people who drink, you know?
9132000	9138000	You either can cut it out a little bit and you're fine, or you have to cold turkey it and not drink at all.
9138000	9139000	Or smoking.
9139000	9145000	You have to get to your other priorities and stop something that's getting in the way of a productive life.
9145000	9155000	Or smoking, Jamie, because some people can do it cold turkey, or some people have to do it cold turkey. Some people need the patch, or a support group, or you know.
9155000	9159000	Or you're my uncle and you smoke the electric cigarettes.
9159000	9167000	Which, actually, I will go ahead and say this. Nicotine, in and of itself, is as bad for you as caffeine. It's all the other crap in it.
9167000	9177000	So anyway, but I do, I personally take exception to the real adult thing, but I understand it. You know?
9177000	9185000	I'm more giving the emailer a hard time, but I just don't like the perception out there that not having some of those things makes you less successful.
9185000	9191000	I actually kind of resent the notion a little bit. So, that's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.
9191000	9198000	But the key was, he didn't say success or whatever. He said something else. But I just, sometimes, society puts these certain things out there.
9198000	9202000	And I don't regret the decisions I've made. I have a great life. Thanks.
9202000	9207000	Yeah, same here. I mean, I'd like to have a job. Not for lack of trying.
9207000	9208000	Right.
9208000	9214000	But at the same time, you know, I think that you can, and I've had to explain this to my mother.
9214000	9220000	And I always give her a hard time because I was like, how much of my Nintendo did you play when I was 12?
9221000	9233000	You know, you can be into gaming. You can be into, you know, people years older than me who are still majorly into every new anime that ever comes out.
9233000	9239000	I'm not as much as I used to be, even though something comes out that I might like, or I like watching the old stuff.
9239000	9247000	You know, everyone's got their thing. There's nothing wrong with enjoying something and having fun as long as you don't do it to the exception of all else.
9247000	9248000	Right.
9249000	9250000	You know?
9250000	9252000	And I think that's the real point. Yes.
9252000	9262000	Exactly. And yeah, I'm not going to go off anymore about that, but I do have to say congratulations to you, Kirk, for your fantastic achievements.
9262000	9264000	I mean, you lost a person.
9264000	9265000	That's amazing.
9265000	9268000	A hundred and twenty-one. Dan lost that much.
9268000	9276000	Yeah. Extifer from Hoard House lost a whole heck of a lot as well. And I know that took a lot of work and it's very impressive.
9276000	9281000	Also, thank you, Fifth Dream, for not making me feel like I'm the oldest person in chat.
9282000	9284000	Hearts. That's it, Rob.
9284000	9288000	That's it for the e-mails. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9288000	9294000	Before we get back into some gaming news, it's time for us to get a little ranty with a segment we call the F years of the week.
9307000	9309000	This is fucked up.
9310000	9318000	I guess the only a few that I have is to this cold that I got from Dan.
9319000	9327000	But other than that, I'm looking at the Adobe site with tears in my eyes. I'm so happy.
9328000	9332000	I'm seriously, like, shaking with joy.
9333000	9338000	It's like Panto knocked on my door and said we want you to design everything in the world for us.
9339000	9341000	Well, that ruins the angsty segment.
9342000	9348000	F you to that e-mailer for the generous gift for screwing up the FUs. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
9349000	9356000	Oh, and F you to everyone putting spoilers out about Star Trek Into Darkness because I haven't seen it yet.
9357000	9361000	And I'm not reading any reviews because they've all been spoilery.
9362000	9364000	Alright. Loki.
9365000	9373000	F you to the, uh, to UEF for their controllers being all sorts of broken. Just the analogs. It's really annoying.
9374000	9381000	It can be fixed with a software patch, but it's not really fixed. It's just kind of a workaround, I guess.
9382000	9385000	It still sucks, though, because I'm trying to play some of these games and it's just like, ugh.
9387000	9388000	That's it.
9389000	9396000	My FU of the week goes to, I don't know, things are fairly well, so I don't have a lot of angst.
9397000	9402000	F you to traffic on the way to the Bay Area because it took me three hours to make a drive that should take an hour and forty-five minutes.
9404000	9411000	And F you to the Kabuki Theater in San Francisco, although actually it's kind of like the good kind of F you because, like,
9411000	9419000	I loved seeing that movie there so much because it was in a theater that served booze and they only let twenty-one and up people in there, so no babies!
9420000	9427000	And the reason why I say F you is now I want to see every movie at that theater in San Francisco and that's not possible.
9429000	9434000	My movie-going experience bar has been forever changed because of that, so.
9435000	9436000	The bar has been raised.
9437000	9438000	That's right. The bar has been raised.
9438000	9444000	Okay, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then we will get to Twitter topics and our Skype line here eventually.
9445000	9446000	So let's get to Loki.
9447000	9461000	So there was an announcement a few months ago about Batman Arkham Origins and, you know, it was revealed that, hey, Batman's not going to be voiced by Kevin Conroy anymore.
9462000	9464000	It's going to be a new person. And there was much bitching.
9464000	9480000	Well, thankfully now the deal has been put in place where, yes, Kevin Conroy will be Batman because he is Batman and he will be returning as the voice of Batman in the new game when it comes out in October.
9481000	9490000	Also revealed, thanks to an Amazon pre-order, there apparently will be DLC where Deathstroke will be playable in some form.
9491000	9496000	Probably like the challenge missions and the other games, but neat.
9497000	9501000	I'm glad that they have the original voice coming back.
9502000	9507000	Now is Mark Hamill actually going to be doing the voice of the Joker again in this game or is it going to be just like...
9508000	9510000	I don't think the Joker's in it. I think that's how they got around it.
9511000	9513000	Yeah, but Mark Hamill has officially retired.
9516000	9517000	Sure he has.
9518000	9521000	No, he actually really has retired. Apparently it was doing a number on his voice.
9524000	9528000	Well, so, yeah, Deathstroke would be kind of cool.
9529000	9530000	I don't know.
9532000	9545000	Alright. I'm excited about the new game, but I'm a little worried that it's another... I think as a lot of people are, I kind of want to wait and see what the reviews look like or what the footage looks like coming out of E3.
9546000	9554000	Is it going to be as good? Is it going to meet that bar that was set by, you know, Arkham City and so forth? Or is it, you know... I don't know. We'll see.
9555000	9561000	Well, one more story for you guys and I apologize. It's political, but it is making the rounds on the gaming blogs this week.
9562000	9573000	And it's a comment from Vice President Joe Biden. Now you might remember that when the whole horrible, horrible thing in the school in Connecticut broke out, Joe Biden started a task force.
9574000	9578000	He was assigned by President Obama to talk about, you know, how do you curtail gun violence and so forth.
9579000	9590000	And they did this whole thing about, you know, games and all this. In May, the Vice President met with 20 representatives from face-based organizations to talk about gun control and immigration.
9591000	9594000	He talked about video games in this as well, according to Politico.
9595000	9604000	Franklin Graham, who is the son of Billy Graham, you know, the evangelistic is what you call him, said to the Vice President that, quote,
9605000	9613000	media and entertainment that portray violence should be subject to a special tax with the proceeds going to help victims and their family.
9614000	9618000	And this is according to a rabbi, Rabbi Julie Schoenfeld, who was also in that session.
9618000	9624000	Biden said, quote, there's no, quote, no restriction on the ability to do that.
9625000	9630000	There's no legal reason why they couldn't, end quote, do a tax on violent media.
9631000	9638000	Going on, the quote says he said they really need a good scientific study, which they've done on things like smoking.
9639000	9644000	So what's interesting about this is that it's not necessarily limited to games, which I can appreciate for one,
9644000	9651000	is that, you know, I don't, you know, when they talk about, like, attacks on violent games, then I'm like, well, what about R-rated movies and NC-17 movies?
9652000	9657000	And what about things on TV and networks? Are they going to put a tax on the nightly news? Because maybe they ought to.
9658000	9660000	You know, because it's pretty violent too.
9661000	9663000	So are they going to tax the Bible because they believe it depicts violence?
9664000	9665000	Oh, snap.
9666000	9667000	That would be hilarious.
9668000	9669000	Oh, snap.
9670000	9672000	It's like, oh, hey, you know, thanks, thanks for mentioning that.
9672000	9675000	And to be fair, just about any religious text.
9676000	9682000	Yes. So I think that's just ridiculous. The only way I could see them ever doing that is because we need the tax dollars.
9683000	9692000	But other than that, I mean, it's just, it's kind of ridiculous. Because once again, you're just taxing things that don't necessarily have a direct correlation with violence.
9693000	9701000	And again, the problem with this, it all goes back to the root problem with that California law that we spent all this money trying to defend.
9702000	9705000	The Supreme Court overturned it because it was all up to somebody's interpretation.
9706000	9709000	And how can you tax something that has to be interpreted?
9710000	9718000	Because, and to be fair to the Vice President, even though I don't necessarily agree with what he said, he did say, we would need a really good scientific study.
9719000	9720000	They would have to have facts.
9720000	9721000	We're going to need to waste more money.
9722000	9728000	Yeah. Right. So I, but I just don't think it would be successful because what is violent?
9729000	9740000	Somebody would have to set that line and it's too, it's too, what's violent to me might be not necessarily what's violent to you, what's not violent to Franklin Graham or Rabbi Julie Schoenfeld.
9741000	9754000	And what they're ignoring is that there actually have been scientific studies that have disproven that violent video games are any more, aren't, what's the word I'm trying to think of?
9755000	9766000	They're just as likely as a movie or watching the news or reading a book. It's the same thing. They're as likely to cause violence as any other portrayal.
9767000	9780000	And then what happens to media that's not rated? A lot of movies don't bother getting rated so that they can still come out in theaters without the NC 17 stigma attached to it because the NC 17 rating is a fucking waste.
9781000	9785000	Well, and it's not like, you know, watching porn means I'm going to go sleep with the pizza man.
9785000	9797000	It's just, well, I mean the whole, the whole rating system in itself is, is a really horrible joke in this. I'm not talking about the game ratings. The game ratings are actually better right now than the movie ratings. They really are.
9798000	9808000	The movie ratings is in need of a serious, serious reorganization. I'm, I mean everything from the fact that you have R rated movies that are like saw level violent.
9809000	9818000	Then you have an R rated movie like Romeo and Michelle's high school reunion is an R rated movie because the F word is used more than once by Janine Garofalo's character.
9819000	9825000	And I put like, I put a movie like Romeo and Michelle next to a movie like saw and I'm like, you know, we got a problem.
9826000	9830000	Well, Janine Garofalo is just an R rated actress, so it makes sense.
9831000	9835000	Well, then she also turned Scientologist, which just makes me roll my eyes and feel very sad.
9835000	9845000	That's her thing. I don't care. That's, that's totally not the point I'm trying to make here is about the movie that it's, it's, it's a joke that a movie like that.
9846000	9856000	I mean, should kids see it? Not necessarily, but I think, I think a 14 or a 15 year old could see it. It's no worse than there are. It's a movie about high school for fuck sake.
9857000	9861000	Like it's nothing different than what they're hearing at school. You know, it's silly.
9862000	9871000	Interesting. Degenerate Johnny in chat at live.voggenetwork.com says FCC has been quoted to state that the ESRB is the best rating system of all entertainment.
9872000	9878000	SSJ 100 Matt in chat says Evil Dead, the new one was originally rated NC 17 until they cut a few scenes out.
9879000	9885000	You know what? I have zero interest in the new Evil Dead. Zero. I've heard things about the movie and I'm just like, no thanks.
9886000	9887000	It does not have the chin.
9887000	9890000	I don't care. I don't care.
9891000	9892000	I can get you legit caught up.
9893000	9895000	No, I really don't care. Thank you.
9896000	9899000	I kind of want to see it, but it doesn't have Bruce. So what's the point?
9900000	9901000	He's in the cameo. See, I know that.
9902000	9904000	I don't care. He's not a Bruce Campbell being in the movie movie.
9905000	9906000	What kind of cameo does he have?
9907000	9908000	I don't remember.
9909000	9910000	Does he open the door for somebody?
9911000	9912000	I don't know. I don't remember.
9913000	9914000	Is he a manager at S-mart?
9915000	9916000	I don't know and I wouldn't want to spoil it.
9918000	9926000	Hey, I don't care. You know what? If the proceeds from this movie go to making an army of darkness 2, I don't care. It exists for a purpose.
9927000	9937000	Judge however you want to judge, but I will be there as I am every single year for the showing of showgirls at the Castro theater hosted by drag queens because I live for that shit.
9938000	9941000	Oh my god. I need to go again this year because I didn't go last year and I'm sad.
9942000	9946000	So judge me all you want. I won't go see Evil Dead, but I'll go see showgirls for the 10th time in the theater.
9947000	9951000	Now I seriously think that they should kickstart a sequel to that movie.
9952000	9957000	Why we're talking about this on OLR, I don't know, but we're almost at the end of the show so we can do this.
9958000	9966000	They got the girl that played Penny in the movie. If you've seen the movie, Penny was like the other stripper who was kind of like the blonde silly.
9967000	9968000	The dumb blonde?
9969000	9975000	Yeah, the dumb blonde stereotype basically. They actually got her there live at the theater. The Peaches Christ, the drag queen who does this, which by the way that's a great name.
9975000	9985000	Actually got her there and part of the reason she was there is that she had self financed or got a little group to finance showgirls to Penny's From Heaven.
9986000	9991000	Was the sequel. It's on IMDB and they actually were selling DVDs and they screened the movie earlier in the day.
9992000	9993000	I need to see that.
9994000	10000000	I haven't seen it. I'm not going to bother watching it. I thought she was a great sport for going and participating.
10000000	10011000	Apparently she is also, there's a showgirls off off Broadway production right now and she actually is in it right now as the character she played in the movie.
10012000	10013000	This thing is great.
10014000	10020000	I just realized I won't talk about Evil Dead but I know the in and outs of showgirls. It's so bad it's good.
10021000	10022000	It's essentially the same thing.
10023000	10024000	I can't help myself.
10025000	10027000	Rob. Rob. I love it.
10027000	10037000	I don't like violence and body parts and animal violence. I love titties. I don't think that's such a terrible thing.
10038000	10047000	And to be fair the sex scene in the pool kind of looked like she was being attacked by a shark. So I mean that's sort of similar to the violence you see in video games.
10048000	10049000	Alright.
10050000	10051000	I mean seriously who does what she does?
10052000	10054000	Alright. Anyhow we get to the show where it's time for
10054000	10060000	Why weren't they trying to get her last year because, get Elizabeth Berkley because it was like the 20th anniversary or something?
10061000	10062000	They were trying to get her but I think she was pregnant.
10063000	10064000	Oh. Yeah. Even better.
10065000	10068000	Can't show up. Baby on the way.
10069000	10074000	Anyway we're about to the end of the show. We're going to get to last minute stories and Twitter topics and the Skype line.
10075000	10079000	But in order to start getting the Skype calls I got to free up the Skype line which means I got to say bye to Jamie.
10079000	10080000	So Jamie.
10081000	10084000	That's okay. I'm lusting over the Adobe suite right now.
10085000	10086000	Yeah go install that.
10087000	10088000	Oh I'm already installing seven programs right now.
10089000	10093000	Yeah save the audition license for me because I might want to check that out.
10094000	10096000	Guys I'm not downloading it.
10097000	10105000	Sorry you had to be here remotely. I know we really like to have everybody here in studio but with no show next week that's a lot of Jamie to be missing.
10106000	10108000	So I'm glad we were able to come up with something else. Feel better.
10109000	10112000	I actually am starting to feel a lot better. My drugs are doing the trick.
10113000	10116000	The power of O.L.R. this show heals. Be healed.
10117000	10123000	I have to tell you that Dan warned me about him being sick in enough time and that we had shared that soda that I started taking precautions.
10124000	10126000	And so I'm not nearly as sick as I might have been.
10127000	10129000	Gotcha. Well I'm glad to hear you're feeling.
10130000	10131000	Preventative medicine. It does the job.
10132000	10136000	Either that or the Adobe just just miracle cure right there. Must have been.
10136000	10140000	I'm going to try this news thing and see if it doesn't piss me off as much as Dreamweaver does.
10141000	10146000	All right. Well Dark Sakura I'll run down the last bits of the show with you here.
10147000	10150000	Do you have any final thoughts or do you have any last minute stories for our listeners.
10151000	10156000	I actually do not. There was one attached to the Sega thing but it's a little bit outdated so I'm not going to bother.
10157000	10160000	OK. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight.
10160000	10171000	I am going to Alabama and if any of our listeners in or near the south with transportation would like to drive me around because I won't have a car.
10172000	10173000	I'll pay for your gas.
10174000	10177000	You're hitchhiking with O.L.R. listeners Dark Sakura is that what this has come down to?
10178000	10182000	Well you remember one of the times I went back like maybe about seven years ago.
10183000	10187000	I went to Biloxi to a DDR tournament.
10188000	10189000	Oh yeah I remember that.
10190000	10193000	It was a fifth mix machine and they had just gotten a fifth mix and we had had it for like ever.
10194000	10199000	So I was you know perfect attacking stuff and you know they're like oh what do you think of this.
10200000	10206000	Everyone was so nice. I love meeting the arcade folks and I got to go to my old arcade.
10207000	10211000	So I'm going to try to make it by the cyber station at the former former Bell Air Mall at some point.
10212000	10213000	You know it's to work there.
10214000	10219000	We may not be the most popular podcast on the Internet but I really love it because you know what some podcasts out there.
10220000	10224000	I'm going to ask you for one hundred thousand dollars on Kickstarter to meet stretch goals here at O.L.R.
10225000	10226000	We just want to bum a ride.
10227000	10232000	Yeah I'm going to be staying in Daphne which is an hour out of Mobile and kind of don't want to be in Daphne the whole time while my mom's at work.
10233000	10237000	Oh gosh. All right well good luck to you and Pixar didn't happen.
10238000	10241000	You'll probably just get pictures of oyster shells.
10242000	10245000	It works for me. All right have a great night Jamie we'll see you back in a couple weeks here on O.L.R.
10246000	10247000	Good night everybody hearts hearts hearts.
10247000	10248000	All right bye bye.
10249000	10254000	And I'm sure she'll be in chat to say good night to the listeners and so forth and finish out our show in the chat room.
10255000	10258000	So if you want to stop on by if you happen to be listening live live dot vog network dot com.
10259000	10265000	But if you want to say hi to dark soccer in the email bag you can always do that as well mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
10266000	10272000	Let's get to the last minute stories and I'll start to read the Twitter topics and we will open up the phones at 1 877 game O.L.R.
10272000	10276000	or username on Skype is orange launch radio. We're already getting calls.
10277000	10281000	The words had barely escaped my mouth and we're already getting phone calls.
10282000	10284000	So let's go to it. Hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this.
10285000	10287000	What up guys. It's Zeno from the OKC. How you been.
10288000	10289000	Hey Zenocore I'm good. How you doing.
10290000	10292000	You know making music here and there. Stuff like that.
10293000	10297000	Yeah. I didn't know you were. I didn't. At least I didn't remember you were a music maker. That's awesome.
10297000	10302000	Well it's a it's a recent thing I picked up over the past four or five months or so. Oh yeah.
10303000	10308000	Yep yep. Got stuff up on SoundCloud dot com slash Zenocore. Check it out when you have availability.
10309000	10310000	Awesome plug. What's on your mind tonight.
10311000	10314000	You guys are discussing the let's play situation. Mm hmm.
10315000	10324000	Yeah. Yeah. I still think Nintendo is going a bit overboard although I think it's a bit of an automatic attack just due to the way that their stuff is set up.
10324000	10334000	They're just but taking the but taking the revenue it's really just putting like giving the guys a noogie on top of taking away their content.
10335000	10349000	I mean that's the way I look at it. I mean the fact that they're taking all the ad revenue as much of a trickle as it is for a company the size of Nintendo is really it's it's literally like snapping you know just doing that little extra to make a point.
10350000	10352000	Yeah but it's not just Nintendo right.
10352000	10362000	Well yeah everybody has the luxury of doing it. I have seen other companies do it before but really I mean they'd be better off leaving it as open advertising for the games.
10363000	10373000	I mean because on top of that the whole sandbox situation does apply. I mean the fact that they gave a product out for play the moment somebody starts playing it is completely different.
10373000	10384000	Like you take a video games awesome live their their production for what they do on top of the game is tremendous and they do it not just for games but for releases and everything else too.
10385000	10389000	If they're if they're going to cut that off they need to cut it off for all media that they do that with.
10390000	10394000	So nobody is allowed to do anything unless they pay Nintendo some money.
10395000	10398000	So meaning like like reviews and things or what.
10398000	10408000	Yeah I mean if they're not if they're not going to treat it underneath fair use then everybody who who openly plays that for longer than five minutes or so needs to pay Nintendo that.
10409000	10418000	And I don't think like for instance Revision3 their reviews go on for eight or nine granted they're a big name they'd never undercut them but the little guys will step all over.
10419000	10436000	Or that I well one thing I was kind of thinking with this is that I'm surprised a lot of people have just said all right we'll just not use YouTube because YouTube could kind of get some of the blame in this too for kind of letting Nintendo or quote unquote letting Nintendo do it or split their videos up into what to say it's five minutes or 459.
10437000	10438000	It's kind of a pain in the ass.
10439000	10442000	It's a pain in the ass but you know whatever I mean if that's what needs to be done.
10442000	10446000	Well that's also going to cut into the then the viewers aren't going to be there either.
10447000	10456000	And also you have to take into account how many video game tournaments are playing are paying rights because that that that many as far as I saw unless it's sponsored by the video game company themselves.
10457000	10463000	That means the streams for Team Spooky are also going to be cut out so they can't show any of the video game tournaments as well as Evo coverage.
10464000	10470000	Well what about Twitch. I mean there's so much let's play that goes on on Twitch that's almost all that site is is let's play stuff.
10470000	10480000	But yeah that means going up against Justin TV and if they really want to undercut Justin TV out of that much revenue that they'd have a court case fight there.
10482000	10489000	I don't think there's an easy answer I kind of think it's going to go back to that guy on our Facebook that said it's going to it's going to take a legal precedent to really figure this out.
10489000	10500000	You know and although you know sure it was a dick move on Nintendo's part and I think it would just been a better situation if they've all splitted the money or worked with the content people to try to figure out a solution rather than sick the lawyers on them.
10501000	10506000	That probably would have been better but again they're not the first to do so and they won't be the last.
10507000	10508000	Yep true true.
10509000	10510000	Other thoughts Xenocore?
10511000	10512000	No that's pretty much it man you guys have a good show.
10513000	10518000	All right thanks for tuning in and lending your perspective one more time for that SoundCloud it's SoundCloud.com slash Xenocore?
10519000	10520000	Yeah give it a listen I think you'll like a lot of the stuff on there.
10521000	10522000	What kind of music? Chiptune? Rock? What is it?
10523000	10527000	Yeah it's sponsored by the demo scene that's what I grew up with so it tends to mirror that but it's all over the place.
10528000	10529000	All right nice I'll give it a listen. All right take care buddy.
10530000	10531000	See you later.
10532000	10541000	All right good call 1-877 excuse me yeah 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call. Loki?
10542000	10546000	Tryon announced I guess that they've had some layoffs.
10546000	10553000	Oh I thought you were going to say something else with this. Tryon also Tryon Worlds announced that Rift is going free to play this past week.
10554000	10556000	I don't know I thought that might have been where you were going with this.
10557000	10569000	No no no they had layoffs so there was a lot of rumors on they haven't really said how many but it was like 70% 80% of the staff was one of the rumors but I don't think that they said that's that's far exaggerated.
10570000	10573000	All right let's go to the phones we have another call coming in. Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
10574000	10575000	Hey it's Prince Brightstar.
10576000	10577000	Prince Brightstar how you doing?
10578000	10579000	Pretty good yourself?
10580000	10581000	Good you said you were going to listen more often you've made good on that promise so thank you.
10582000	10583000	I've tried to make it every week since.
10584000	10585000	Awesome well what's on your mind tonight?
10586000	10589000	I've also got a comment about the whole let's play situation as well here.
10590000	10591000	A lot of people do what's up?
10591000	10601000	Well I recently started doing a let's play myself particularly with Minecraft and also some of the fantasy star games.
10602000	10608000	I started this back in December but I have yet to monetize any of my stuff because I have yet to actually get into any of those networks.
10609000	10619000	But my understanding on the whole situation with Nintendo is they're even monetizing for themselves stuff from the IGN network and game station and such like that.
10619000	10648000	So I'm wondering if they have actually broken contracts in this and if it's time for the let's player community to actually get together host some sort of charity drive or rather a donation drive which will cover the fees for all this, the lawyer fees and actually take this to court because the laws are just very very out of date at this point to be able to cover something like let's plays.
10649000	10651000	You mean fair use laws need to be reexamined?
10652000	10659000	Exactly because Nintendo may also be cutting into reviews and such which are allowed under fair use.
10660000	10674000	Well what about some of the things I was saying earlier like you can't do, I can't put an entire movie up and do talking over the movie but if I wanted to do a movie review I could obviously use little bits and pieces which I could still do with a Nintendo game.
10674000	10679000	But I can't exactly upload that to YouTube where I talk over a movie. I mean why is it different with games?
10680000	10694000	True and I agree with that and in that situation you can't do it. In fact what most people do currently is they go and sell their tracks sort of on a site like Rift Tracks or something like that.
10694000	10703000	The problem with video games is they're an interactive medium. So when you're watching a movie it's going to be the same for everybody regardless.
10704000	10715000	If you're playing a video game your experience is going to be different. Granted I respect Nintendo and any other company for doing what they want to do because it's their game.
10715000	10726000	But the gameplay itself and any commentary or putting their face on the video or putting their chat on the video as well, that's their property at that point.
10729000	10743000	So what do you think as a let's play person yourself, let's say something's got to give here and Nintendo wants a little piece of the pie and a little bit of the revenue. What do you think would be a solution that would make everybody happy?
10743000	10767000	Honestly I think it's better that this doesn't actually go to court and each company either says you can do whatever you want or cut some sort of fee or say flat out you can't do this and don't post any videos to make it clear as to what you're allowed to do, what you're not allowed to.
10768000	10777000	And I think it's also up to the community to respect that and not put out videos that the company states they don't want videos out there.
10778000	10790000	Especially maybe for newer games. Having Let's Play of Bioshock Infinite before the game's actually released when a lot of people want to know what's the ending, that could be detrimental to the game.
10791000	10812000	Exactly. Or for in a worst case game like say Aliens Colonial Marines, if all those reviews hadn't come out so quickly and I realize this hurts the community even more but with the reviews and also the embargo that was out, people weren't able to cancel their pre-orders before it was too late on that game.
10813000	10817000	Good point. Alright well Prince Brightstar, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?
10818000	10819000	That's it for tonight.
10819000	10820000	Alright, you take care buddy. Thanks for listening.
10821000	10822000	Alright.
10823000	10829000	Alright, bye bye. We'll try to squeeze in one more call. 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Other stories, Loki?
10830000	10838000	They said there's going to be another dashboard update or there's a rumor that another dashboard update is going to come to the Xbox 360 before the next system comes out.
10839000	10840000	Interesting.
10841000	10845000	Saying that it's going to update the interface again to make it look more like Windows.
10846000	10851000	Do you think this could be because of some of the rumors about the set-top boxes that are going to come out really cheap?
10852000	10856000	I don't know about that but maybe they're just trying to update it so it looks nicer or something. I don't know.
10857000	10858000	I just hate when they keep changing your face though.
10859000	10862000	Let's go to the phones and take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10863000	10867000	Hey, this is your opening act for I guess this is the last time I guess. After all the shots fired.
10867000	10876000	I'll let it slide this one time but you make another Chrono Triggers better than Super Metroid joke and it's over. I'm kidding. It's all good fun. What's up Bobby?
10877000	10884000	So I just wanted to repeat something that I've actually been repeating and it's one thing that a lot of people don't realize about this whole Nintendo Let's Play thing.
10885000	10890000	Just because it's free advertising doesn't mean they have to want it.
10891000	10896000	And I think that's something that a lot of people, they're like, oh it's free advertising, why wouldn't they want it?
10897000	10901000	Maybe they don't. Maybe they want to control more of the advertising.
10902000	10910000	And so the argument of it's free advertising, they should be happy with it. There's free advertising that I've gotten over the past eight years that I haven't wanted.
10911000	10914000	Ooh, that's a good analogy. That's a really good analogy.
10915000	10925000	Is that sometimes people will say something and kind of use your site or your show or something and you're kind of like, I don't know if I would necessarily have said that myself.
10925000	10928000	Yeah, that's a really good analogy.
10929000	10933000	So just because it's free advertising doesn't mean they necessarily want it.
10934000	10944000	The difference between Minecraft, the reason I fully support Notch for his position is because he's not telling a story in Minecraft. He gave an actual sandbox.
10944000	10945000	Yeah, that's true.
10946000	10952000	And you're telling your own stories, whereas a Let's Play of Luigi's Mansion, you're telling the Luigi's Mansion story.
10953000	10960000	Granted, you're going right or left whenever you want to, but you're still telling Nintendo's story.
10961000	10975000	Yeah, but you could say that sandbox games, you know, say if I go and just run around in Saints Row the Third and just not necessarily play in the story stuff, but just kill people or do silly stuff, that that should be fair because I'm not telling stories.
10976000	10981000	And I agree with you on that, but that's different than playing the Saints Row the Third story.
10981000	10991000	That's kind of where my line is. Like, yes, screw it around in Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row or Minecraft, absolutely that should be fair use.
10992000	10996000	Or Machinima is a great example.
10997000	11004000	Except with Microsoft's game content rules, you have to work out with them if you're going to do Machinima.
11005000	11007000	Microsoft laid the hammer down on that.
11007000	11016000	Fifth Dream says they don't want Nintendo games associated with loud cursing and stoners. Interesting.
11017000	11026000	Well, I don't think that's all of your Let's Play people, but certainly there are some Let's Play people. Hell, we did Mass Effect drunk the other night and maybe BioWare didn't appreciate that. I don't know.
11026000	11036000	But once again, though, they need to get with it. I mean, sorry that, you know, Microsoft's not saying that they don't want their games associated with, you know, stoners and loud moths and stuff like that.
11037000	11041000	But they keep saying that they keep like going back and forth with what they want.
11042000	11047000	We're going to make games that appeal to core gamers and stuff, or we're going to make family games.
11048000	11053000	Or we're going to make it so that it's more friendly for third parties and now we're going to make first party games and stuff.
11053000	11062000	I think that they need to figure out what their focus is instead of trying to like, I don't think they know what their focus is almost.
11063000	11068000	Like they're trying to appeal to people that aren't buying their system or something. I don't really know what it is.
11069000	11084000	Yeah. But what a really interesting point is that they may not want the advertising. You know, it just kind of makes me think like, you know, I'm really appreciative that there's many of you out there that put like O-L-R in your usernames or your clan names or O-L-R or V-O-G, you know, for VOG and so forth.
11085000	11096000	And I think that's really awesome to help spread the word. But you better not be acting like an idiot when you're doing that because then it makes people go, I don't know what this VOG thing is, but what a bunch of assholes, you know, and that's not good.
11096000	11098000	That's not the advertising we want.
11098000	11108000	I think it's necessarily that, you know, maybe these people are fans of those, you know, those games and so they're excited about that. It's not necessarily like spread advertising.
11108000	11114000	I mean, because no one needs to advertise Super Mario Brothers. Everyone knows what the fuck Super Mario Brothers is for the most part.
11114000	11122000	I mean, obviously, you know, we've seen some pictures from Super Mario World and Super Metroid that people don't know, you know, how to play that.
11123000	11132000	But I'm just saying that for the most part, people are aware of what it is. It's not necessarily free advertising, but it's, I don't know, it's just a unique take on it with the Let's Play stuff.
11132000	11142000	Unless you're just straight playing through the game without any sort of commentary on it. It's really hard to say that you're taking anything away from them, I guess. I don't know.
11143000	11153000	But it's still, yeah, it's free advertising, but Nintendo may not want that advertising and maybe they're okay with the Let's Play community saying we're not going to do Nintendo videos anymore. Maybe that's what they want.
11153000	11163000	And so this is, you know, they're kind of doing, oh yeah, we're the good guys. Oh, well, you didn't want to take our offer, so, you know, okay, have fun doing the Microsoft and the Sony stuff.
11163000	11166000	Well, no, they won't be doing Microsoft either.
11166000	11170000	Yeah, but Microsoft hasn't gone through with YouTube.
11170000	11177000	Well, they haven't, but, I mean, they did kind of make the first move in this whole thing a few months ago.
11177000	11193000	Still, that's even weird, though, that they would, because once again, I would see that as strange if they're going to try to put out these sort of features where they're trying to get people to broadcast on Twitch and broadcast on YouTube and stuff and share all these videos and things.
11193000	11196000	Oh, but we don't want you to do that. Or at least don't want you to make a living.
11196000	11198000	No, they don't want you to make money doing it.
11198000	11201000	Well, pardon me, tell me how I should make my money.
11201000	11218000	Nintendo's not pulling a Sega, Microsoft's not pulling a Sega, but they're just saying you can't, and at least Microsoft has a licensing path so you can make money from it, but it's probably, you wouldn't be able to recoup the licensing costs unless you were machinima.com or Revision3 or one of these larger sites.
11218000	11229000	Well, what we need to do is we just need to have some sort of reform to this whole, you buy the game, you get the game thing instead of it being a license, because this is where all the bullshit's coming from, is fuckin' licensing software.
11229000	11240000	It needs to be you own that shit. Not that you can turn around and say, okay, I buy Halo 4, Halo 4 is mine, and I'm gonna sell copies of it and claim that it's, you know, Loki's Halo 4.
11240000	11246000	Yeah, but that's exactly what you're saying, is that, you know, in order to own it, you have to be able to do that.
11246000	11262000	I'm sure that we can kind of come to a sort of happy medium where, if it, unless it's about piracy, you know, just straight up piracy that you at least own the stuff that you have, like, you know, I, just because I own a car doesn't mean that I've manufactured those cars.
11262000	11268000	I can't go and clone my car and expect to get away with it, but that car is mine, I can do whatever the hell I want to it.
11268000	11277000	Alright, well, no easy answer to this, and I'm sure the conversation will be continuing through the next few weeks, especially when we see what other companies are gonna follow in Nintendo's footsteps, because I bet there'll be at least one.
11277000	11292000	But, Bobby, before I let you go, earlier in the show we were talking about some of our predictions for Tuesday's Xbox announcements, and I was kind of curious, since, you know, you are the opening act and everything, as you say, what are your thoughts?
11293000	11313000	I mostly agree with you guys, they're not gonna, no price, no date. I still think, I do think Xbox Infinity is gonna be the name, I know that they'll give the name, I know that they'll show a couple games, but I think they'll talk more about the entertainment offerings and stuff.
11313000	11326000	But you gotta realize, this is also being broadcast live on TV, right? So they're probably gonna try to reach everything and leave a lot of the core stuff, maybe, to E3, I don't know.
11326000	11337000	I do think it's funny, and I mentioned this in chat and I don't think you guys picked up on it, about the Space Poncho thing, they have gone full board with the Twitter handle Xbox Reveal Tent.
11337000	11353000	And it's actually an official Microsoft person actually posting as the tent, and it's been tweeting for like the last week as they've been setting things up, so they're actually making the tent that the Reveal's taking place in a character, and fully embracing that.
11353000	11358000	So that's probably gonna be the Space Poncho of this year, or at least, that's what Microsoft hopes the Space Poncho of this year is gonna be.
11358000	11364000	You have to understand, you can't force Space Poncho, Space Poncho is just something that happens, it's a natural thing.
11364000	11372000	You can't just make a viral video, the video has to go viral, it's different. Good point, good point.
11372000	11375000	So Bobby, you looking forward to checking out Gran Turismo 6 when it comes out?
11375000	11381000	Did Gran Turismo 5 ever come out? I will get to play Saints Row 4.
11381000	11386000	Oh yeah, yes, I know you're looking forward to E3, it's only a few weeks away.
11386000	11393000	I did get my appointment time, it's Wednesday morning, that's when I'll be playing Saints Row 4, they said they're actually gonna have a playable portion.
11393000	11399000	I hope I'm there with you so I can pick up the phone and actually call Loki after that and hand you the phone.
11399000	11404000	Yeah, I got to play Saints Row 4 as well, I downloaded The Trouble with Clones expansion as well.
11404000	11409000	Alright, that's it, we're ending the show. Alright Bobby, any other quick final thoughts before I let you go?
11409000	11411000	Chrono Trigger greater than Super Metroid?
11411000	11414000	That was a bad final thought and for that I'm hanging up. Goodbye.
11414000	11417000	That would be an incorrect thought.
11417000	11424000	Alright, we're gonna close up the Skype line. I'm really sorry, there were a few of you still trying to call that didn't get through.
11424000	11430000	I'm very sorry but we are running a little over and I have to do some things after the show.
11430000	11436000	Do remember you can always tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r, you can also email us, mailbag at orangesontrated.com.
11436000	11438000	That's a great way to get all of your thoughts out.
11438000	11445000	Let me, speaking of twitter, go to the twitter real quick. Loki, I don't know if you had any other last minute stories real quick here.
11445000	11451000	Not really, it's just a story that they've already talked about doing this before but they're replacing Microsoft points with real money.
11451000	11459000	Tigerclaw tweeting us that BlazBlue anime is getting a fall release in Japan. I didn't know they were making an anime about BlazBlue.
11459000	11460000	That makes sense though.
11460000	11461000	That's pretty cool.
11461000	11464000	They're making a game for Guilty Gear so that's pretty cool.
11464000	11466000	A good way to kind of enhance things.
11466000	11474000	Misty is sending us some tweets from ASEN because she was at the show and she tweeted us some pictures from Pinkberry.
11474000	11479000	Thanks for rubbing it in Misty because I wish I could be there right now because that cookies and cream flavor is so good.
11479000	11487000	But there's that free advertising that maybe Pinkberry doesn't want the advertising we keep giving them on our show.
11487000	11488000	We should stop that.
11488000	11493000	Spazinator tweeting us his Facebook fan page for his kitty Anakin.
11493000	11495000	That is a cute cat.
11495000	11501000	See now I'm looking at cat pics but I like that you set up a whole little Facebook.
11501000	11509000	Smiling Yoshi tweets us and says, smiling Yoshi wonders if he'll someday be subject to Nintendo's defense of copyrights.
11509000	11512000	I mean, I'm a Yoshi doll and I'm so darn cute.
11512000	11514000	Oh, I remember this account.
11514000	11520000	This is a Twitter account that's this little dolly Yoshi that makes all these tweets and it's really cute.
11520000	11522000	See, there's smiling Yoshi.
11522000	11523000	So it's a little doll.
11523000	11526000	Imagine like a garden gnome that goes everywhere and tweets from all over.
11526000	11527000	Yeah, I have that doll.
11527000	11528000	Oh, okay. There you go.
11528000	11532000	Well, I should say Josh has that doll but we have that doll in the house.
11532000	11538000	Well, so smiling Yoshi is worried that maybe Nintendo is going to shut down this Twitter account.
11538000	11548000	I don't think you have anything to worry about because at least, you know, I'm looking at your user icon which is Yoshi kind of setting on your feet or a friend's feet or something like that.
11548000	11556000	And I'm thinking, you know, that picture is like 5% Yoshi and 95% a body in a room.
11556000	11558000	So I think you'd be okay.
11558000	11561000	I think that would actually be okay with fair use laws.
11561000	11563000	Just so you know.
11563000	11568000	ActDeaf tweeting us, Guilty Gear XRD sign got announced today.
11568000	11570000	Yeah, that's the game I was talking about.
11570000	11571000	I didn't know there was a, oh, okay.
11571000	11586000	I think it's kind of funny though that name though, you know, XRC sign or XRD sign because it's like all the, you know, games have been like Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus or like, you know, they have like some sort of weird symbol after them.
11586000	11592000	So it's like XRD, it's like X entry into the series and some random sign.
11592000	11595000	And lastly, a tweet from Eric RPG.
11595000	11598000	People often say devs are high when they make game ideas.
11598000	11600000	Here's one put to practice, maybe.
11600000	11610000	And he tweets us a link to something over on Destructoid about the game Demon Cheek, like it's chic and it's new.
11610000	11621000	And I guess this is coming out of the Destructoid podcast where, oh, where they take, oh, they talk about things on the podcast that ought to be turned into video games.
11621000	11625000	But it looks like somebody actually turned this idea into a video game.
11625000	11627000	What a novel idea.
11627000	11630000	Do you listen to this show every week, Eric?
11630000	11632000	Because the same thing happened to us, not that long.
11632000	11635000	Maybe that's why he tweeted it to us, actually.
11635000	11638000	If only someone would make a game like, you know, about...
11638000	11641000	Bungee Ferret talking like we said ought to be a game.
11641000	11644000	If only that was available on Xbox Live indie games.
11645000	11652000	But anyway, Demon Cheek is apparently a crossbreed between WarioWare, Earthbound, and the Curse of Monkey Island.
11652000	11654000	I don't even know how that goes together there.
11654000	11660000	But I guess if you're a fan of Destructoid's podcast, then there's lots of lolsy in-jokes there for you.
11660000	11662000	Well, fine.
11662000	11665000	If Podtoid's gonna get a game, then you know what I want?
11665000	11666000	You know what I want?
11666000	11668000	I want two games.
11669000	11671000	One game isn't good enough anymore.
11674000	11676000	Alright. Anyhow.
11676000	11679000	That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
11679000	11681000	Because that was it for Last Minute Stories, right?
11681000	11683000	Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show.
11683000	11686000	If you like our show, remember this is an indie production.
11686000	11689000	We do do everything here, you know, for free.
11689000	11692000	We don't really monetize the show like maybe we ought to.
11692000	11695000	But we do pay out of pocket to do the show.
11695000	11697000	And you know what? We just love the community.
11697000	11700000	We like paying the money to spend time with our friends every week.
11700000	11702000	All we ask, help us grow our community.
11702000	11704000	Tell a friend or two about the show.
11704000	11706000	And help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.
11706000	11708000	It helps.
11708000	11710000	And keep showering dark soccer with gifts.
11710000	11712000	Because she really likes that too.
11712000	11714000	And gets her all verklempt.
11714000	11716000	That was really awesome though.
11716000	11718000	That was a great idea too.
11718000	11721000	I love that because it's something that in turn will just help vog in general.
11721000	11723000	So that's awesome.
11723000	11725000	Anyhow.
11725000	11727000	Before we close up shop, we gotta go around and get final thoughts.
11727000	11729000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11729000	11739000	My final thought is that I showed quite a bit of self restraint in this digital games mayhem sale on Amazon.
11739000	11742000	Because I didn't buy a lot of this.
11742000	11744000	I buy random weird shit.
11744000	11746000	But I only bought two things.
11746000	11749000	I bought, was it the Sam and Max collection.
11749000	11751000	Which is all three seasons of Sam and Max.
11751000	11754000	So that's like 18 episodes of gaming to play.
11754000	11758000	And then Scene02 because I didn't have it yet on Steam.
11758000	11760000	So it'll be pretty good.
11760000	11762000	And, and, and.
11762000	11766000	I need people to give me suggestions for game night.
11766000	11769000	Because otherwise I'm just gonna pick something at random.
11769000	11772000	It may end up being Call of Duty or something.
11772000	11774000	Because I can't think of...
11774000	11780000	Or we'll play Minecraft again and Bobby will show up and it'll be just me and him again.
11780000	11784000	But no seriously I need some suggestions.
11784000	11787000	And whether or not you guys want to do Thursday or Friday.
11787000	11790000	Because Friday might have to start a little bit later in Friday.
11790000	11792000	Because Josh usually stays up a little bit later.
11792000	11795000	Because we try to get him to leap in a little bit later.
11795000	11799000	But it'll be like 8, 8.30ish.
11799000	11803000	And I think that way we can play a lot longer.
11803000	11808000	Because we won't have to worry about work day next day.
11808000	11810000	For most people.
11810000	11813000	But yes let me know on the forums what you want to play.
11813000	11816000	So we can consider that.
11816000	11820000	Alright. A couple of final thoughts from me.
11820000	11823000	I will echo what Bobby Blackwolf in chat is saying.
11823000	11825000	Some VOG announcements coming on June the 2nd.
11825000	11827000	So stay tuned for that.
11827000	11829000	Horde House has a big surprise this week.
11829000	11831000	So tune in on Wednesday at 7 o'clock Pacific to hear that.
11831000	11833000	So I guess just plugs from me.
11833000	11835000	So there you go.
11835000	11838000	That's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11838000	11840000	We will be back probably in two weeks.
11840000	11842000	But stay tuned to our Twitter.
11842000	11844000	Just in case we're able to pull out a show during Memorial Day weekend.
11844000	11845000	We'll let you know.
11845000	11847000	But otherwise have a great week.
11847000	11850000	For those of you in the States have a great three day weekend on Memorial Day.
11850000	11852000	For those of you throughout the rest of the world.
11852000	11854000	Have a great week whatever you're doing.
11854000	11856000	And E3 is almost here you guys.
11856000	11858000	Lots of gaming news coming at you.
11858000	11860000	Brace yourselves for this Xbox thing on Tuesday.
11860000	11862000	It should be interesting.
11862000	11864000	Have a great week everybody.
