13732	24519	Tonight, May 19, 2013, Nintendo makes a controversial move against Let's Play videos, virtual trading cards come to Steam, and a new Gran Turismo game is announced for the PlayStation 3.
31431	36752	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36812	44754	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May 19th, 2013, episode number 505 of our show.
45414	54636	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about games and gaming news with all you in our chat and listening on our podcast feed and my co-hosts.
54936	57677	Joining us remotely tonight, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
58117	58337	Hi.
58597	59397	Hi, how are you doing?
60117	61038	I have a cold.
61359	62260	I'm sorry to hear it.
62360	63081	How'd you get that?
63842	64242	Dan.
65804	67807	He's like, I just have allergies.
67847	68788	Let's share a soda.
68968	70190	Oops, sorry, it was cold.
71451	74074	I thought maybe he might have got something at that whole Pentagogo thing.
74114	75236	Did you go to that?
75456	76117	Which was this weekend?
76841	77582	and DarkSakura.com.
95775	97377	There ain't shit in Dixon either.
97397	99119	It's a weird place for Pinagogo.
99199	100180	There's stuff in Dixon.
100240	102763	There's pollen and a really good ice cream parlor.
103143	105105	They don't even have a 24-hour Starbucks anymore.
106146	108228	But they do have a Mary's Pizza shack.
108449	108829	Yeah, they do.
108869	111131	And they do have Pinagogo, which is pretty awesome.
111151	113574	Apparently this year was supposed to be totally bombed.
113614	115516	They had every spot filled.
115796	118239	They couldn't take any more people in because of power usage.
119239	128361	I really wanted to go because they had all kinds of prototype machines and they had the new X-Men table and all kinds of stuff.
128421	134542	I really wanted to go, but Dan was sick and I wasn't going to go without him because I have no other reason to go to Dixon.
135802	136402	Who can blame you?
137543	140443	We'll also say hello to, here in studio, Techmaster Loki.
140703	140903	Hi.
141303	142203	How are you, Techmaster Loki?
142423	143004	I'm fine.
143104	145124	I'm organizing Steam games.
146587	148309	Now what was this you were trying to figure out?
148690	158402	Maybe one of our listeners knows because we do have the live chat room at live.vognetwork.com when we are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
158722	159764	We do have the chatters joining us.
159944	161706	Maybe one of them knows the answer to your question.
161846	167608	Well, I was just wondering if there's a way to... Oh, I guess there's different categories and stuff you could say.
168529	171610	Just seeing if there's a way to, like, you know... Oh, okay, here we go.
171670	172210	Categories.
172471	173831	You can add categories to the games.
174031	180174	Basically, the folder sort some of the games I have, because I have now over 100 games.
180674	181694	Thank you, Amazon.
183235	184656	Do they have a crazy sale recently or something?
184676	187157	Yeah, it's still going until the end of the month.
187277	192460	It's their mega sale or something.
192580	195602	There's a whole bunch of games and bundles and stuff.
195622	196963	There's some really good Sonic bundles.
197003	203206	If you like Sonic the Hedgehog, you can get almost all the games that they have on PC, including the Genesis stuff, for like $20.
204427	206549	It's like a Steam sale, but it's on Amazon.
206709	207649	Yeah, actually, that's the thing.
207789	215275	I've been finding a lot of these sales on Steam games on other sites, like Green Man Gaming or Amazon.
215455	223220	Amazon, for a lot of the stuff, even Gamefly has stuff, and it's all redeemable on Steam or Origin.
223240	227363	They actually have some games on Origin that I really wanted, but I am not installing Origin.
227383	228543	I don't blame you, sir.
228644	229424	I'm passing on it.
229464	230145	Battlefield 3 was $10 on Steam.
232406	233087	I really wanted Battlefield 3.
233147	237590	I feel like I had to sell my soul to play Mass Effect 3 online on the PC.
237930	239531	And I really wanted Command & Conquer.
240112	244355	Thankfully, I wanted Red Alert 3 because I forgot all about it.
244615	247518	And I went back and I started playing some of the older games.
247618	254163	But I saw in the trailer for it that they have George the K's in it.
254583	255243	Mm-hmm.
256324	258006	Tim Curry is in it.
258086	259027	Yes, Tim Curry is in it.
259208	263232	And they even have... Oh, who the hell is it?
264113	266476	I can see her face and I can't think of her name.
267297	268278	Jenny McCarthy is in it.
268598	269399	She plays Tanya.
269659	270060	Random.
270621	272703	Yeah, she plays like the assassin chick.
273123	275246	But yeah, it's so awesome and just...
275946	302343	and because they went back in the second game I don't know if they had the full motion video cutscenes but they went back to the way that the first game was where they had full motion video cutscenes and it's just awesome but it also has origin and I'm not I'm not doing that so I'm sorry going to the chat room at live.vognetwork.com Actdeft says you can sort your games in your Steam library so you can at least sort them differently
304093	305814	XBOX 720, XBOX INFINITY
328480	329200	DarkSakura.com
351306	352027	I'll just talk.
352628	354230	Loki will do the one-man show.
354250	355332	Didn't you do that one year?
355492	356954	I've done it a couple times.
357274	359497	Yeah, those shows are really interesting, you guys.
359517	362581	You can discuss pizza and bacon.
364344	364784	I might.
364924	366927	If I've got stuff to talk about, it's not so bad.
366947	368730	But trying to stretch like, you know...
369450	398210	it's more fun when it's live and we have the chatters for that kind of instant feedback too even when we're wrong I can team up with Bobby I guess there you go you can team up with Bobby but I don't think Bobby's looking for a partner that would be hilarious but he's my only friend on multiple gaming services alright let's talk about final predictions for the new Xbox I guess I will start with our resident loud mouth Loki and I say that with love
400264	403347	Well, I'll tell you, I'll just start with what we're not going to see.
403367	406410	We're not going to see a date other than holiday.
406430	407652	We're not going to see a price.
408413	413218	And we're not going to hear anything about DRM, so you can just forget about that.
413458	417302	That's going to have to come with press asking follow-up questions, that kind of stuff.
417343	419325	They're not going to say, oh, by the way, use games.
419385	419625	Nope.
421106	422447	I don't think they're even going to do that.
422787	424448	Like I said, that's going to be really weird.
424929	428571	Although there are some stories that make me wonder if there is something coming.
428731	430932	But once again, everybody has to be on board.
431093	432353	Not just them.
432934	436176	All platforms have to be on board with it in order for it to work.
436816	437477	So it's not going to happen.
440358	444121	I don't even know what we're going to really see as far as new games.
444321	444561	I mean...
446588	449310	Specs, they're going to show us specs.
449570	451691	They may show us a box.
451771	455494	If you think about it, how hard would it be for them to mock up something?
455574	457095	It doesn't have to be exactly like that.
457135	460477	It can change once it goes to retail, but they can mock up something.
461497	464459	Just have it there so that people can not bitch about it.
466580	468442	And things do change before retail.
468482	468782	Exactly.
468802	470663	I think about the PlayStation 3 boomerang.
470804	473005	Oh yeah, the PlayStation 3.
473085	476268	It's going to be 1080p, 120 frames per second.
477489	480031	It's going to have 20 USB ports in the back.
480091	485054	It's going to have a million USB ports and three HDMI ports or something.
485275	486355	What do you even need that for?
487276	490137	Well, if you want to, like... A daisy chain.
490317	495960	HDMI in, HDMI audio to your receiver, and HDMI to your TV.
496300	496540	Whatever.
496880	498921	But, I don't know.
499301	500282	They'll probably just talk specs.
500302	509406	They'll talk about, you know, I think they're going to focus a lot on, like, the entertainment stuff, you know, with the whole, you know, taking over your TV, being an entertainment hub.
510626	511746	I just hope there's something cool.
512406	517447	I just don't want to see connect, connect, connect, connect, connect.
517887	520348	With the new video game console, you want to say something cool?
520788	521288	Yeah, I know.
521368	522288	It's shocking.
522308	525929	I have to say, though, I am going to get a new video game console this year.
526009	527629	I am going to buy one of those at launch.
527869	533550	It's either going to be the PlayStation 4 or the... My money's on Wii U. For you, Loki.
533590	533970	No.
533990	535771	No, no, no, no.
535931	537071	There could be a price cut at E3.
537984	538685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
564196	571060	I'm actually going to second a lot of what Loki said, just because I'm sure we're not going to get a specific date, we're not going to get a specific price point.
571500	576003	We'll get a name, we'll get a few screen captures of video games that are actually PC screen captures.
577904	586968	More about it being for entertainment, the multiple use, you get pictures of actor families together looking happy and waving their hands around looking stupid.
587509	589130	Stupid and happy, stupid and happy people.
590150	610136	um you know the name confirmation just the you I mean I've seen so many Sega announcements and they've been the same I'm not saying what am I saying Sega um Xbox announcements and they've been the same type of thing every year I think it's just going to be their usual pattern I'm not going to be surprised by anything
610538	611679	Cirque du Soleil this year?
612019	612819	Space ponchos?
613459	613859	No.
615220	617981	Well, the thing was that the... Information-wise.
618181	621162	The actual tent is the space poncho.
621242	622843	It's like you're in the space poncho.
622883	624304	It's like meta space poncho.
624324	627645	Alright, anything else, DarkSakura?
627665	628605	That's what it should be.
628645	633988	Hey, you guys like the hashtag so much, we now present the Xbox space poncho.
635308	636229	And they'll have a...
638340	644166	EA humping them in the background and it won't sell in Japan.
644246	648230	Anything else you want to say about that, DarkSakura?
648571	651153	Going to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
651173	654277	Some comments on Loki's possible solo podcast next week.
654837	660243	Alan Alchemy in chat says, Loki's totally rational and not loud Nintendo critique and discussion hour.
662198	667067	I am 100% rational, and I am only, I critique because I love.
668930	672857	DarkTetsuya says, Loki's Bacon Pizza Podcast, where do I subscribe?
676067	678428	at the hospital when you guys all have heart attacks.
678468	679189	That's where you subscribe.
679209	680769	That's not going to happen.
682150	682650	My turn.
682770	684291	So what do I predict for Tuesday?
684511	685812	Definitely you're going to have the name.
685932	686632	That's for sure.
687232	690434	Finally, we can stop calling it the 720 and we'll know the real name.
690734	692855	Unless it is the 720, which would be hilarious.
693095	693776	Please no.
693936	695396	Please, Microsoft, no.
695416	696677	We've spun around twice.
697357	698358	I still vote for the lube.
699138	700819	I love the name Xbox Salub.
701799	706420	Xbox Infinity seems probable, but I do think that's more internet wank.
706520	708141	I think it's just simply something you haven't heard.
708161	709121	My money is on Fusion.
709761	711802	Xbox Fusion.
713482	722344	Also, you will get... I think they are going to one-up what Sony did, and I think they will show you what it looks like, even though it is, of course, subject to change.
723225	725185	Absolutely not on the date.
725425	726746	Absolutely not on the price.
726926	727426	That will be E3.
728786	742973	and I think one thing y'all need to be prepared is that there's not going to be a lot of games shown because they've already pretty much come out and said E3 is all about the games and I think that's a really risky move on Microsoft's part because I can just see the Twitter snark now
743473	744294	Where are the games?
745054	749237	Well, they did say they're going to show the Call of Duty Ghost thing.
749718	754701	That will be shown, but that's one game, and that's a game we already kind of knew was coming.
755162	757223	I don't think you're going to see any bang up.
757283	757383	Okay.
758704	760325	Let's go to Rumor Wankville.
760365	762106	Let's go to the wankiest of wanks.
762286	762686	You ready?
763146	767189	If there's a new Killer Instinct game on this Xbox, you ain't seeing it tomorrow.
767729	769170	That would be an E3 surprise.
770210	772291	That would be the end of the E3 presentation.
772311	775253	If they're going to pull out that kind of wank, that's when that's coming.
775273	778254	I want to see him do something like that and then just drop the mic at the end.
778555	780375	Just drop the mic and walk off the stage.
780696	782196	It's like, done.
782597	783677	Or just fire a gun.
784418	785758	Shots fired, Sony.
785978	786379	Bam.
786479	786899	We're out.
790705	815120	I think it's going to be a lot I think it's a lot about trying to get the tech world kind of buzzed up a little bit and I think you're going to see much more on the if it's true that they want to replace your cable box which I think could be a likely thing I think we're going to see a lot more about that and definitely interaction between Windows 8
816741	831972	and how you can interact with things on your PC and how the PC will work as you know pretty much what you've already seen with Windows Media Center but I think they're going to kind of bump it up a little bit and Windows Phone because you know it's all about the synergy between all those different Microsoft phones.
832392	844240	It'll be all tablets and you know iOS and they come on they know that they're limiting themselves they're not no one is going to buy a Windows Phone for the next Xbox.
844340	845441	But any of that stuff?
846341	850042	The snark in you ought to be asking, will Microsoft let it last more than a year?
850282	851882	Or is it going to be the next game room?
852202	853542	The next smart glass?
853882	855483	The next HD DVD drive?
855563	859784	Or on top of that, is half the stuff they're even going to show actually going to be possible?
860004	864084	Remember, hey, I'm scanning the bottom of my skateboard to bring the artwork into the game.
864384	868925	Versus, hey, I'm scanning my pictures so that I can get a color for my car.
869185	872046	And it always looks pink because the lighting in my room sucks.
873486	875868	I think you will see some games.
875908	876928	Like a limited amount.
877108	879349	I think it's going to be a lot of what we already know about.
879690	884252	And maybe like a teaser reel of Stay Tuned E3 for more on this.
884672	888695	You know, like a full motion video that will make no sense at the very end.
888775	890756	And like, you want to see what this is?
890836	891897	Stay tuned for E3.
892217	893858	That's how it'll end or something like that.
894738	896499	It'll end with Square Enix coming out.
896919	899061	We're going to have... We would like to announce...
900101	901942	A game that we're going to announce at E3.
902782	903162	See ya.
903442	915246	EA will walk out on stage and go, we are going to give our full support to the next... We believe the next Xbox is the future of gaming and we are going to partner up with the... And we'll be all sitting here going...
915726	917707	Didn't we hear this before a couple years ago?
917727	919468	Actually, you are correct.
919508	920609	They will be out there.
920709	931815	I do think that they're actually going to be in the presentation because one of the rumors was supposed to be that Titan game from the ex-Infinity Ward guys, their new company.
932015	933276	Oh, the actual Titan game.
933456	934717	No, the actual Titan game.
934957	940540	When you say Titan, my mind goes to Horde House, Blizzard, and all that, and I think of the Project Titan that Blizzard's doing.
941261	942041	But no, it's not that.
942061	942141	Okay.
943962	953611	I think that we can all agree, though, that no matter what Microsoft says, there is going to be a shitstorm on the internet immediately following.
954151	957334	Absolutely, which is really interesting because I'm actually going to be out of town.
957374	960256	I'm not going to be able to watch it live or participate in the snark on Twitter.
960296	962578	I'm going to watch it live and I'll participate in the snark.
963119	963939	Of course you will.
964019	965301	You should live blog it for us.
965481	968023	And I already have my popcorn, so I'm all ready.
968890	974613	I'm a little sad I'm going to be having to watch it late, but I'm going to be up in Reno.
975214	976574	I'm not getting up at 10 a.m.
976614	977835	to watch this crap.
978876	979576	I'll be busy.
981197	987921	So I'll have to kind of wait and see it later and have to go rewind the snark over on Twitter.
988681	990422	Alright, so we'll see what happens.
991163	997186	I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and I'm kind of curious what you guys think is going to happen.
997386	1001849	Actdeft says, I'm betting on Xbox Power 3 or X-Cube.
1001869	1004291	That might be a little too close to GameCube.
1005291	1007634	Shadow Next Gen says Xbox Infinity makes sense.
1008034	1010517	Turn the Infinity symbol right side up and what do you get?
1010597	1012859	The number 8, which can tie into Windows 8.
1013620	1025913	Here's my whole kind of like, hmm, with that though is that we had that news, was it this week or last week, that they're going to move on to Windows 8.1, which is that Windows Blue they've been talking about, which is going to be a free upgrade for Windows 8.
1026133	1027274	So it's basically like...
1028155	1029716	I thought they should call it the Texaract
1057343	1057924	Why is that?
1058425	1067485	Because a Tesseract is a fourth-dimensional cube, since they would have, if you were going by box to cube, the next step up would be a Tesseract.
1068783	1072385	But then again, I watch way too much Cosmos, so just ignore me.
1074126	1074446	All right.
1075606	1076007	There you go.
1076047	1084931	Those are some of the chats from live.vognetwork.com because, again, we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, and it is all about letting you guys have your voice in the show.
1085471	1089833	And I know a lot of you are going to have some reactions after Tuesday, so please, we want them when they're fresh.
1090274	1096397	Email us, mailbag at orangeloundtrader.com, or you can always tweet us at OLR, and we're also on Facebook and Google+.
1097117	1100318	So interact with us and we'll read your comments here on the show.
1100959	1108402	Let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you've been playing this week while you wait for this next wave of game consoles to take off.
1108682	1109663	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1109703	1110323	How was your gaming week?
1110825	1117207	My gaming week was kind of less eventful just because I've been getting ready to leave.
1118548	1120108	I've played Ragnarok online too.
1120188	1122829	I'm definitely going to quit WoW.
1122869	1129592	It's just I'm trying to find a time to log on and finish up some stuff and give people some money if anyone ever went on the Alliance Guild again.
1129612	1134794	For your money, I'll sign into my Paladin.
1134914	1135534	Give me a dollar.
1136857	1142862	I have a lot of money on my Alliance account, which makes me kind of want to transfer one of my toons over.
1144263	1152089	But I've been playing some Ragnarok Online 2, and Gravity is doing this sort of drawing thing where you can win a prize.
1152950	1156433	Your name is entered for every hour you're logged in, so there have been a lot of vendors.
1156853	1158034	A lot of vendors in-game.
1159715	1161977	I've been doing my weekly Mass Effect 3...
1164435	1167857	I would call it my rant fest whilst playing.
1169158	1169838	I've been doing that.
1169858	1170719	A let's play.
1170899	1172920	That's going to come up later in the show.
1173000	1174621	So it's a let's play, basically.
1174881	1184227	No, it's more or less me just doing the MST3K thing with it and telling off characters and calling Udina asshole.
1184327	1186088	Okay, so a let's bitch.
1186928	1190270	It's Mass Effect 3 Rocky Edition.
1190290	1191071	Okay.
1191091	1191271	Okay.
1192381	1194503	Alright, so I've been doing that.
1194663	1200168	I also bought Borderlands 2 because right now I think it's still on sale on Steam.
1201549	1204551	It went to some ridiculous price, like $13.
1207073	1210396	So I went ahead and picked up Borderlands 2.
1211697	1215300	Even if it's going to make me puke my brains out from motion sickness.
1217282	1218583	Dan had such a good time playing it.
1219204	1220625	Dan also got a new racing rig.
1222068	1223231	I saw those pictures on Facebook.
1223271	1223792	It looks sweet.
1223893	1225557	He's got like three monitors, right?
1225577	1226599	And a little sit-down seat.
1226940	1228705	Well, he had the monitors already.
1229587	1231451	They're actually three TVs.
1233200	1233480	and DarkSakura.
1253850	1257212	and the guy came and delivered it and it was pretty neat.
1257893	1259854	So he's got a lot of racing going on.
1259894	1261495	He's looking forward to Grid 2.
1262576	1273423	And so I've been indirectly participating in his racing addiction by watching him and commenting and going, that car sucks.
1275530	1277871	But that's really been the extent of my gaming.
1279211	1280411	No, I played something else.
1280691	1282952	And for the life of me, I can't remember what it was.
1282972	1283632	So just forget it.
1284452	1285112	Oh, yeah, Off.
1285593	1287373	I was going to say, I must not have made a big impression.
1287433	1288013	What is Off?
1288113	1288913	I don't know if I've heard of this.
1289234	1291834	It's a very, very weird little RPG.
1293475	1294955	Especially now that I can play it windowed.
1295015	1300936	It's like you are sort of like controlling an avatar and your avatar is called the batter.
1302117	1302997	Like a guy with bats.
1304475	1309958	and you go around and do puzzles and talk to people and it's bizarre.
1309998	1310638	I'll put it that way.
1310718	1312399	But it's free.
1312819	1313859	It was done by...
1315762	1316422	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1346448	1351051	I just want to go, you're freaking out over no news, really, nothing.
1351631	1357034	They haven't done anything, you're just, you know, Yahoo doesn't have the best track record, but still.
1358255	1366640	I think I made this comparison on Bobby Blackwell's show when we were doing the call at the end of his show, as we always do, but it's kind of like Grandma taking you to a One Direction concert.
1367121	1368481	That's what that buyout feels like.
1368942	1369702	What's One Direction?
1371183	1372084	It's a British thing.
1372324	1374345	I thought you were up on all your Brit stuff.
1375003	1377325	I'm not up on things that suck.
1378726	1379667	So you do know what it is.
1379727	1379967	All right.
1380788	1382109	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1383310	1385672	I played a whole bunch of different things this week.
1387554	1388074	So let's see.
1388134	1396361	Started off this week, we did VOG Gaming Night, Grand Theft Auto 3, or 3, Grand Theft Auto 4 free play.
1397442	1401145	I promised I wanted to be there, but I drove to San Francisco to see Star Trek.
1401205	1401806	Did you play the game?
1403462	1405684	No, not yet.
1407306	1408647	So we just kind of hung out.
1409107	1411370	We were going to try to join other people's free mode games.
1411430	1412771	It was just a big combat fest.
1412811	1417255	And we didn't really want to shoot each other, which is kind of anti-Grand Theft Auto, but we were just messing around.
1417295	1423501	So we went to the swing set of evil or death or whatever you want to call it, and we're launching cars out of that.
1424442	1425423	And that was kind of fun.
1425823	1427385	So we messed around with that a little bit.
1428145	1431086	and then let's see what else.
1431266	1433686	Oh, and for next week, I have no idea what we're going to play.
1434026	1437807	So anyone has any suggestions on what you want to play?
1437887	1439248	That'd be fantastic.
1439888	1451550	And also I'm thinking about maybe toying with the idea of changing the night from Thursday to Friday because I know it gets kind of late, especially when we're starting at 8 o'clock on the East Coast.
1451630	1453571	I mean, on Thursday night, it's a little odd.
1454071	1457634	But maybe Friday, we'll see.
1457894	1459796	Also have video capture equipment finally.
1459836	1462238	I got an Elgato Game Capture HD.
1462278	1468263	Ooh, you have to tell me how that works, because I really want to get something for the living room here to do that type of thing.
1468463	1471466	Yeah, it looks pretty simple, so I'll have to mess with that.
1471934	1474457	And then, um, okay, so back to games.
1475157	1481703	Um, so I had the urge this week to play Command & Conquer Red Alert, like, the first one.
1482484	1488270	And so I was gonna go buy it from Amazon, because they have their sale going.
1489171	1492134	And then I was doing some searching and it's freeware!
1492554	1496338	So I downloaded it for free, which is fantastic, that's the best price.
1496758	1500682	And so I installed it, had to add some different patches to it to get it to work in Windows 7.
1501843	1506948	And the first thing I had to do, mod it, because that's what I do, I play modded games.
1507509	1509571	So I messed with the rules I had filed to mod...
1510892	1512273	Kind of how I had it before.
1512313	1518379	I had a really cool setup back in the day when I was playing it with all these custom units I made and stuff.
1519299	1521341	So I kind of remembered some of that and put it back in there.
1521401	1522902	So I played a skirmish game last night.
1522922	1525004	It took about, like, two hours.
1525084	1526445	Just because I was toying with the computer.
1526465	1528407	I wasn't, like, immediately going for the kill.
1528427	1531350	I was just letting them kind of, you know, live a little bit.
1531810	1532691	But it was pretty fun.
1532711	1533651	I had a lot of fun with it.
1533671	1535993	It still runs like shit, though, on my computer, which is weird.
1536254	1537295	Because it's such an old game.
1537315	1538315	You'd think with, you know, the...
1539176	1540558	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1555353	1558234	I was going to say, you gave it a very favorable review over at VOG Network.
1558514	1559854	Yeah, it's fantastic.
1560314	1564576	See, my laptop is not very... I mean, the graphics card on it is not great.
1564736	1568897	I ran everything in that game on low visual settings, but I never noticed.
1568977	1570597	I mean, it looked just like the console version.
1571318	1576499	I mean, apparently it has really good visuals, but you have to have a pretty decent graphics card, and I'm kind of limited.
1576539	1579260	I can't upgrade my graphics card in my laptop, so...
1579600	1580961	You weren't the only one that seemed to enjoy it.
1581141	1583542	I'm seeing a lot on the internet, a lot of good reviews for that game.
1583762	1589684	But yeah, it reminded me a lot of Bioshock Infinite, just with the different story elements.
1590725	1591725	It's very linear.
1595086	1596507	Bioshock was very linear.
1596547	1600088	There's a little bit of, okay, you can do this, you can do that differently.
1600469	1602790	You can do a lot of stealth in the game, which is kind of cool.
1603950	1606391	You can take out lights and...
1606591	1611798	and a lot of the lights thing plays into the stealth stuff.
1611959	1614202	There's a mode that's pretty difficult.
1614242	1618408	You can actually play the whole game without killing anybody except for the mutants.
1618548	1621512	You have to kill the mutants because they'll just charge right at you.
1621532	1622794	You can't walk past them.
1623414	1640209	but there's an achievement you get for doing that and I don't know I just enjoyed it I enjoyed the storyline I haven't played 2033 I have 2033 so I should probably check it out although now I've had the ending spoiled because you know they kind of give it away at the end of this game because it ties in with it
1640669	1662735	but um yeah it was a really great great game i'm glad i got to play because i wasn't really familiar with the series at all and it's pretty awesome so definitely worth checking out and i know a lot of people might want to wait until a sale comes and if it's anything like the other deep silver games it'll be deeply discounted pretty soon because they really knock the prices off their games pretty quick
1663898	1675902	And just a quick plug, since you did bring up the review that you did for this game, if you check out his review over at vognetwork.com, and I noticed for the live listeners, Bobby put that in chat, but it's really easy to find if you just go to vognetwork.com.
1676222	1682704	The really cool thing about the way the website is built over at VOG Network, or the Voice of Geeks Network, is that you can actually do a response review.
1682824	1686805	So if you also like the game, or maybe you didn't like the game and you want to have your say on that,
1687325	1688906	You can actually write a response review.
1689126	1700632	And the way it's done is that we actually screen the reviews to make sure they're not trolly, to make sure they are thought out, to make sure they're worthy of posting right underneath the main review.
1700752	1703914	And we never judge that on opinion, whether you love it or hate it.
1703954	1708556	We just want to make sure it sounds like you've actually played it and that you're not just first.
1708596	1711518	It's not like a Metacritic thing where you're like, one, ten.
1711738	1712098	Exactly.
1712118	1713699	It has to be a little more thought out than that.
1714199	1720424	Um, so we will, uh, of course approve those and, uh, you get your review right there, right underneath the main review.
1720464	1721765	And it's, it's, it's pretty cool.
1721825	1724667	And one of the things that makes our site really unique, uh, which I like.
1724727	1727409	So you only have a limited amount of time to do that though.
1727449	1729390	I, I, I don't remember what it is.
1729690	1730671	Bobby, you'll have to remind me.
1730691	1732132	I think it's like two weeks or a month.
1732492	1733633	You can also do that on movies.
1733873	1737216	I know a lot of you've been seeing Iron Man 3, Star Trek, uh, Into Darkness.
1737616	1740278	Both those movies are also reviewed on our site and you can participate with that.
1740703	1742865	And then the other things I played on the Ouya.
1743225	1744426	I've been playing a lot of stuff on the Ouya.
1744446	1749890	I've actually been playing a lot of the Pingo, Puzzle Poker.
1750231	1754714	It's like this cross between poker and bingo.
1755915	1758037	And I can't beat my high score though.
1759057	1762180	And she keeps extending, they have a high score contest going on right now.
1762620	1763580	And she keeps extending it out.
1763600	1767501	It's now June 15th is when that expires because there's not a lot of people participating.
1767901	1778284	But man, I have a 591,000 score that good luck anyone beating that because I've been playing every day and I can't beat that.
1778744	1779185	I got close.
1779205	1779705	I got 491 the other day.
1781925	1782525	So I believe that.
1782585	1783586	It's pretty fun.
1784746	1785846	I was trying some other games.
1785866	1796608	I've been doing a lot of these quick looks at different games on the Wii, and I've actually been posting quite a bit on my YouTube channel, which is just LokiOLR.
1797569	1804430	And I've been noticing a lot of problems with those analog dead zones.
1805170	1808291	I wasn't noticing it originally, but man...
1809531	1811753	They're bad on those early controllers.
1811853	1821641	It's just not... You try to turn diagonal and your character slows down because it's like you're not pushing very far and the analog's sick.
1822222	1825925	I played this Amazing Frog or something like that.
1826825	1850892	and the volume on it they have these boom boxes in the game and the audio is so fucking loud it's ridiculous i had to shut the game off like it's actually funny if you watch the video um i shut it off because it's so goddamn loud on the game and like i had the volume on tv wasn't that loud because i've been playing other games in it but the audio of those boom boxes is just so fucking ridiculous that i was like i'm gonna try to smash this thing but oh that's kind of fun
1851645	1851906	Jeez, Rob.
1874625	1875325	Check that out whenever.
1875485	1876105	I know.
1876606	1881167	Well, our site is just so intricate and awesome that I forget things.
1881247	1882227	It's too complicated.
1882587	1883167	Nice save.
1883247	1883808	Nice save.
1884068	1884828	I need a user manual.
1885168	1885408	All right.
1885848	1887749	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1889549	1892730	I think that's it for this week.
1892770	1899612	But, yeah, seriously, though, there's a topic on the gaming section on the VOG forums.
1900332	1901293	for the gaming night stuff.
1901633	1902814	Let me know what games you guys want to play.
1902834	1907838	It doesn't have to be on Xbox 360, it's just it's been that way for the last couple times.
1908479	1911821	PC, PS3, whatever you guys have, whatever you want to play.
1911921	1917005	Obviously pick a game or consider games that allow a lot of people to play.
1917045	1919827	Like Saints Row the third multiplayer, not going to work because it's only two people.
1919847	1922890	It'd be fun, but you just can't really do that.
1922930	1929595	So something that preferably free, like Team Fortress 2 was one that I thought of because I haven't played that and it's free, so...
1929986	1931126	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1955976	1958858	So we can have a no-shame noob night on Team Fortress 2.
1958998	1960078	I think it would be a lot of fun.
1960679	1964281	Because I would like to see something like that for League of Legends and Dota.
1964381	1972465	I need a friendly, warm environment to help me learn some of those games as opposed to the mean assholes that make up a lot of the League of Legends community.
1972725	1973705	That'd be my mode.
1974286	1990873	You know one of the games I've been looking at, like one of the sale things that they have on Amazon right now, speaking of games to get into and stuff, Civ V. They have Civ V Gold with some other thing on there and then XCOM for like 20 bucks.
1991093	1991713	Pull the trigger.
1992233	1992893	It's great.
1993193	1994234	Civ V is great.
1994966	1996527	I think Civ 4 is also in there.
1997288	1997788	Oh, nice.
1997909	2000771	Well, Civ 4 was a great game too, but Civ 5 is awesome.
2001091	2005735	And that would also be a game that would make a great night sometime.
2005755	2010299	But that is going to have to be an OLR weekend game.
2011300	2011600	Anyway.
2012601	2013101	Thanks for watching!
2034132	2034813	Star Trek Online 5 Minutes
2061618	2062418	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2085709	2094683	So I made my guy and I had fun doing the little tutorial but I had to go somewhere else so I didn't get to play I didn't get to actually interact with other people so that was that
2096877	2098137	Quinto does the tutorial battle, he's the EMH
2118927	2119948	Oh, okay.
2120168	2120428	Okay.
2120708	2122189	Alright, got it.
2122289	2125110	They changed so much in it, it's not fun anymore.
2125770	2127351	Why is that?
2127371	2128611	I don't know enough about the game.
2129451	2130972	They changed the skill trees.
2131432	2142537	They completely redid the skill setup for how you assign and do your points and your various weapons that you can pick up for your different classes.
2143157	2147119	My normal class is an engineer and I always do the...
2149244	2149824	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2170458	2188338	and it just took forever to get everything and I also had like the middle level account because I had stopped paying my subscription but I had been paying a subscription so it was just all I did last time I played was hang out at Deep Space Nine and play Dabo seriously that's all I did
2188838	2194763	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com reminding us Star Trek Online has a new DLC pack called Legacy of Romulus.
2195083	2195984	Yes, I did notice that.
2196384	2198326	It's all over the splash screens when you log into the game.
2199206	2206812	Some other folks in chat, a variety of people talking about the Star Trek game that just came out on 360 PS3 and the negative reception it's getting.
2206832	2210315	I've seen Shadow Next Gen in chat saying stay away, far, far away.
2210936	2211116	So...
2211496	2212337	Diablo III Diablo III Diablo III
2234119	2256401	Well, I read somewhere they were doing a 25% increased XP and magic gold find weekend Because this is the one year anniversary of Diablo 3 coming out So I was like, what the hell, I'll go take a look And I actually played enough, I finally beat the damn game A year later, finally beat Diablo 3 I killed Diablo, and I'll tell you what
2256821	2257541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2276988	2284392	I had some really good gear, but when I got to the last act, when I got to the second half of Act 4, that game started kicking my ass.
2284432	2285452	It got a lot harder.
2285972	2289994	And when I finally got to the Diablo fight, I think I had to fight him like seven times before I got it.
2290034	2293736	It was as intricate as a raid fight in World of Warcraft.
2294016	2295457	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2318274	2340678	a couple people on my friends list got a little butthurt that I didn't want to play Diablo 3 with them but I said a long time ago I was gonna do that and I was gonna play it through because one of my friends was like let me help you kill Diablo let me help you kill Diablo and I'm like no um but uh I did it so now I'm gonna explore some of the multiplayer stuff that's the next thing I want to do in Diablo and move on to the nightmare difficulty or whatever because
2341238	2342860	Was it worth the blood pact?
2342900	2342980	Huh?
2343000	2343681	Was it worth the blood pact?
2358695	2364220	Well, yeah, because I played enough WoW and I got Diablo 3 for free, so it's hard to bitch.
2365602	2372308	And to be fair, maybe the ending gets better when you play it on the higher difficulties, because you can play it through four different difficulties, right?
2372368	2373189	And then hardcore.
2373650	2375571	So, you know, I don't know.
2376012	2382198	But anyway, because I never beat games, I thought y'all could appreciate I did finally, finally beat Diablo 3.
2382238	2382438	Hooray.
2383759	2385240	and that was pretty much my gaming week.
2385880	2387901	So, quick housekeeping.
2388261	2390202	We may not have a show next week.
2390482	2393863	In fact, I'm going to say right now it's very likely we will not have a show next week.
2394243	2395804	Stay tuned to Twitter for updates though.
2395844	2397565	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2397865	2405508	We will let you know mid-week because we do want to do something about the Xbox thing on Tuesday and getting some immediate reactions to that.
2406188	2408109	I do want to plug our Facebook.
2408609	2410950	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and of course Twitter.
2410990	2412211	Twitter.com slash OLR
2412871	2418876	And also, I thought we would take an opportunity and plug some of the Twitch TV live streaming we've been doing.
2419637	2423560	I've been doing it all on the main OLR channel, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
2423820	2425642	And I'm going to try to convince Loki to move there.
2425962	2426622	That's fine.
2426662	2427503	I only did it once.
2427723	2429044	Right now you're streaming where?
2429064	2432267	I think it's Loki OLR on Twitch.
2432647	2436410	But now, Jamie, you do some more personal projects where you're doing sketching and things like that.
2436450	2438031	So you do have your own Twitch channel for that.
2438071	2438552	Where's that at?
2439473	2445136	It's Kuro Tsubasa, K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.
2446017	2450399	But I'm actually thinking about making an actual live stream account just for the drawing.
2450699	2450939	Nice.
2451780	2453941	Because Twitch is more for gaming.
2454881	2463446	To be honest though, I'm probably going to be taking a little bit of a break from doing the hardcore projects because I finally, finally finished my FemShot project.
2464141	2465962	How many FemShep drawings did you end up doing?
2466622	2465962	22.
2466642	2467522	22, wow.
2467582	2469343	Two of them were mine.
2471263	2478325	But yeah, they're all done and they are on Mass Effecting, my Tumblr for all things Mass Effect.
2478345	2486347	Well then maybe we'll have to get your gaming stuff on the OLR channel as well and then we'll have all those subscribers still built in from the days we used to do the show over there.
2486968	2487548	That'd be nice.
2488408	2488668	All right.
2489368	2495950	But for now, because when we're off a week, the live streaming is a really good way to kind of keep tabs on us during the week.
2496590	2510213	We do make sure that we're streaming when there is not other programming at the Voice Geeks Network, which we always try to promote the other great independent shows, everything from TVs to movies to anime to British stuff to American stuff to Australian stuff.
2510553	2512794	It's all at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
2513474	2522117	Um, let's get into gaming news, of which there was a surprising amount of it this week, although I guess we are getting in those weeks leading up to E3, so more and more is going to come up.
2522397	2524278	Only a couple weeks away, so.
2524978	2525478	Alright, Loki.
2525898	2541184	So, EA shockingly announced that they are putting an end to their online pass program, and basically saying, yes, we are discontinuing online pass, and none of our EA titles will feature, or include that feature.
2541364	2541504	Huh.
2541664	2542024	Feature.
2542605	2543205	That's funny.
2543245	2543665	Feature.
2544466	2552371	It says many players didn't respond to the format, and we've listened to feedback and decided to do away with it moving forward.
2553612	2560337	Which makes me think, what the hell is coming up that we don't know about that's going to take the place of this?
2561397	2563519	I think a lot of people had that reaction.
2563659	2566321	There's that initial celebration, the Kermit flail.
2566621	2567262	Yay!
2567562	2569444	The EA got rid of the online pass.
2569465	2572148	They realized it was a really off-putting idea.
2572428	2574250	But then it's like, wait a minute.
2575091	2576253	This can only get worse.
2577842	2581603	EA is not a company to go, hey guys, we were wrong, sorry.
2581804	2583284	Hey, hey, you know that SimCity?
2583544	2584845	We should have made it offline.
2585045	2586405	Here's a patch to make it offline.
2586605	2587745	They're not going to do that.
2588026	2592167	It's going to have something that's being done by the console manufacturers to take the place of this.
2592207	2594228	The money is going to come from somewhere.
2594268	2598989	And I wonder, well, even if it's not necessarily that whole thing that it's... Microtransactions?
2599309	2600730	I think it's increased DLC.
2601670	2616061	I think that's where they're going to make and remember this point because I'm going to bring it up again later in the show when we get into something else involving EA but I think the whole DLC and the microtransactions is how they're going to make up the money I think you're going to see more games that really rely on that
2616681	2643929	you know that to make their why not it works for Facebook and free to play games and a lot of companies unfortunately are moving into that dangerous space where it's like oh well people the consumer wants to play Facebook game and they want to buy all these little free jewels and energy packs and I don't know there's a part of me that's like that's gotta be something I don't doubt that they're gonna charge you $60 for a game and have a bunch of crappy DLC for it
2645109	2647730	or some good DLC, but probably a lot of crappy DLC.
2647850	2653213	Do you think that possibly the relationship with GameStop came into this?
2653273	2669041	Do you think maybe GameStop maybe choked a bitch, so to speak, and GameStop might have been like, you know, our retail people don't really push your games because you don't get the same value out of that and we kind of like to push the 2K sports games that don't have the online passes and
2669341	2682619	I don't even know if that would have really I think that maybe they just found that they weren't making a whole ton of money off of it maybe they think that their games are so awesome that people are just buying them new anyways although I don't know it's just
2684172	2685532	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2715485	2718950	Really, the only companies left would be Ubisoft.
2719572	2722897	Well, Warner Games, they still might do that, but...
2724655	2742967	Really, their next big game coming out is Batman Arkham Origins, which doesn't have an online component, but last time with Arkham Asylum, they had the whole Catwoman DLC, which was the sort of online pass, pre-order bonus, whatever you want to call it.
2744268	2753414	Ubisoft and Sony, really, Sony First Party would be the other ones that have that in there.
2755817	2759020	DarkSakura, what do you think about the whole EA getting rid of the online pass?
2760462	2768270	I think it's a smart move for one thing, but I think that they're going to replace it with something more nefarious.
2768810	2774076	I trust EA as far as I can pick up their entire headquarter building and push it.
2776178	2781262	Well, I think this is a good excuse to check in with the listeners here for a minute.
2781462	2783223	And I think we're going to do a live poll.
2783823	2784564	How's that sound?
2784944	2790248	All right, we're going to go to vognetwork.com, and specifically live.vognetwork.com.
2790568	2793009	And we're going to ask our question of the live listeners.
2793430	2797272	And tonight's question is, why did EA get rid of the online pass?
2797773	2801195	And here's some of the options collected from what the hosts have said so far.
2801635	2803777	They are truly trying to look less evil.
2804457	2806478	There's something about the new consoles.
2807199	2809381	They're going to rely on increased DLC.
2810101	2813564	GameStop put them in a chokehold or something else.
2813864	2814644	You can vote now.
2814964	2818027	Register participants at live.vognetwork.com.
2818047	2821789	We'll see the poll up there on the site and can vote right now.
2822029	2824651	And you'll see that under the chat box at live.vognetwork.com.
2825052	2827113	We'll go over those results there in just a minute.
2827613	2831836	Cool thing is that once you vote, you can actually see the results come in live.
2832957	2838123	And so far, everybody is saying there's something about the new consoles, dot, dot, dot.
2838143	2839784	But see, there's nothing already.
2839884	2845630	They've already talked about the PlayStation 4, and they've said that there's nothing preventing used games.
2846211	2847332	So I don't...
2848633	2851074	I don't know if there is going to be anything with new consoles.
2851114	2853075	Maybe they just decided, hey, you know what?
2853475	2856236	We're just not making a ton of money off of this.
2856516	2858857	Although, I thought they said they were making quite a bit of money.
2858937	2862438	So why would you just get rid of money or give up on that?
2862518	2863178	Exactly.
2863299	2867980	I mean, is it really that much of a trying to save face after what happened with SimCity?
2868781	2870681	Because people are kind of expecting that.
2870801	2871562	Anyways, maybe...
2872982	2873422	I don't know.
2873482	2876344	I don't really know what their thought process could be.
2876384	2877224	I guess we'll find out.
2877425	2879226	We're definitely not going to find out on Tuesday.
2879246	2884088	They're not going to say, hey, by the way, we're going to have a feature that's going to prevent you from buying music.
2884568	2889471	Yeah, the negative stuff or anything that can be perceived as negative, that's not coming out on Tuesday.
2889491	2892593	They're not going to come out on stage and say, oh, yeah, and this Xbox has to...
2893073	2896216	I think it would be cool if they did address all those.
2896236	2899419	If they had actual responses that were positive, like, it's not always online.
2899439	2900621	We've heard your worries, and it's not.
2909769	2919935	All the guy talking, all the talking head would have to do is get up there and say, you know, and don't worry if I lose my internet connection, I can still play the game.
2920315	2923417	So stop tweeting about it, you know, or just make a little joke about it.
2923817	2924877	Like that's all they would need to do.
2925578	2928739	And everybody could laugh it off like an old sitcom at the end.
2930260	2930580	Anyhow.
2931541	2931821	All right.
2932302	2932642	Let's see.
2932662	2934183	I'm going to check the results here.
2934563	2936304	Still 58% of the vote.
2936405	2938406	There's something about the new consoles.
2938526	2940708	No votes for GameStop putting them in a chokehold, though.
2940748	2942009	People don't think that seems to be it.
2942649	2944290	So a large amount of people as well.
2944310	2947853	30% they're going to rely on increased DLC.
2948553	2952496	About 8% right now saying they are truly trying to look less evil.
2952536	2954517	So 8% giving them the benefit of the doubt there.
2955678	2956159	So we'll see.
2956960	2959562	I'll check in with that poll one more time after this story.
2959662	2962586	Give you guys a last chance to vote there at live.vognetwork.com.
2963266	2965208	This is getting a little bit of controversy this week.
2965248	2970454	The story that's going around about a game that isn't even out here in America, but a lot of people here have an opinion on it.
2971074	2972255	The game is in Japan only.
2972315	2976136	Nintendo of Japan makes this series called Tomodachi Collection New Life.
2976876	2995143	This is a game that's on the 3DS, and from my understanding of the game, I'm not going to confess to know a whole lot about this game, but it's kind of Nintendo's answer to The Sims slash Animal Crossing, and it uses Miis, and it's one of those life simulation type of games.
2995843	3006010	Well, apparently there is a glitch in the game, and according to some people in Japan, what happens with the glitch is that the glitch enables same-sex marriages to appear.
3006070	3019040	And what you do, you bring your Miis over to the 3DS using the Mii transfer tool, and somehow this glitch will allow your character to bathe with characters of the same gender, make babies...
3020718	3042393	Defy the laws of science and everything and you know raise babies and all that stuff with the whole same gender and obviously places like Tumblr are very and the story actually says this hey it's true though places like Tumblr and some of the fan sites are very happy about this and posting their pictures of their happy little gay family and so forth and you know
3043554	3049796	Obviously, as a gay guy myself, I like to see a lot of this stuff that's positive in games.
3050197	3052577	I love the way The Sims does it.
3052597	3053798	The Sims is a great model.
3053838	3060340	It's like one of those games where it's like, you know, The Sims just will like whatever they like, whatever you want them to like.
3060700	3061621	There's just no...
3062501	3063502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3083954	3089818	Getting a notice on home menus notification that a child will be sent on a journey but no actual message is there.
3089878	3093720	That's clearly something in the game that I don't know much about because I don't know the series very well.
3094180	3096342	But a lot of people... Instead of taking the Republican route, you know?
3097342	3098283	Well, here's the thing.
3098343	3111871	There's a lot of people out there that are like... You know the way games journalism works where it's copy-paste, copy-paste, but make the headline more sensationalist each time is that Nintendo bans same-sex marriage from their game.
3112051	3112271	You know?
3112311	3112411	It's...
3113812	3121998	Okay, maybe the way this really is, is that Nintendo didn't plan to put same-sex marriage in their game.
3122458	3129083	It ended up there anyway through a bug, which will also cause save files to corrupt and so forth, so they've got to do something about it.
3129603	3135547	You know, I don't think they're necessarily trying to patch out the gay marriage, but that wasn't supposed to be there in the first place.
3136688	3138668	I'm not as upset about this as you might think.
3138889	3147570	I mean, again, I'm gay myself and I like to see this stuff in games, but I also realize a lot of Japanese games don't have gay marriage stuff in their games.
3148511	3152991	Final Fantasy XI, you could marry in that game, but they didn't do same-gender weddings.
3153051	3155832	It was something they were thinking about or whatever, but they never did it.
3156212	3157832	It was like that for Ragnarok Online.
3158613	3160173	Did they do same-gender as in Ragnarok?
3161030	3162091	Yeah, they did.
3162471	3164192	You had like marriage skills.
3164573	3169837	Like if you married your character, you could teleport to wherever your character was or do like healing stuff.
3170957	3174360	But they didn't have it to where it would be same gendered.
3174520	3180665	And people who took private servers actually had to modify some of the programming in the game to enable it.
3182274	3199965	Dark Tetsuya in chat says from what I read of the story the fix is only for the problems with the side effects caused by the glitch and that would be a great way to kind of resolve this scenario so that way it's like okay if people kind of figured out how to work the system and get two guys in there then whatever and I think that's that's a good way to do it.
3200545	3222286	and I think we are headed in the right direction folks culturally like I look at games like Mass Effect and yes I know here I am bringing up that game again but guys it's done so well in that series that I there's a reason why I really love Mass Effect and and games like The Sims and other games and you look at what's happening culturally is that what did we have three states that
3222586	3223706	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3242415	3245156	will update to reflect that as well.
3245577	3258102	But for right now, I don't believe gay marriage is legal in Japan, so it's probably why they didn't think to really put it in there as a fully fleshed out thing, and why it is still kind of a bug that the two guys actually make the baby.
3258723	3260563	Which, you know, you would...
3261844	3262224	and DarkSakura.com
3289864	3298495	Yes, but they actually are working on using cloning technology so that two people of the same gender can have a child together.
3299656	3300838	So just saying, science.
3302392	3322522	so I think generally culturally and I'm not trying to get too political on this show but obviously you know it's an issue it's kind of important to me it's one of those things where it's like you know it's it's more and more becoming not a big fucking deal and that's really what this should be is it's not a big fucking deal if two guys want to do something that doesn't affect your life whatsoever you know what I mean it's just
3323584	3351586	yeah anyway I'll get off my soapbox so what do you think DarkSakura about this Tomodachi collection I think people are just I think unfortunately the sensationalism of certain gaming websites and so forth tended to make this story a bigger deal than it is but I think certainly there's got to be Nintendo kind of looking at this going oh well I guess if people are going to have these tumblers and so forth about it maybe this is something we should have thought of putting into their first place I don't know what do you think Jamie uh
3353348	3378428	I think it should have been there from the get-go, and if it's possible, I mean, clearly the glitch is causing some problems, and I have no problem with them fixing those effects of the glitch, but I would want them to see them leave in the option to actually even make it, if they could incorporate some way to make that a regular feature in the game, instead of just it being a glitch, and using that to fix the problems, then that would be the way I would go.
3379255	3389584	And I would also request that they actually bring this game over to America or, you know, so I can feel like I know what the fuck I'm talking about with this game because I'm going to be honest, I don't.
3389704	3395028	I can only really go off of screenshots and little YouTubes and things I see of the game and my assumptions.
3395268	3396790	But, you know, I would play it.
3397150	3398911	I'd like to know a little more about what this game is.
3400433	3401573	Tomodachi means friend.
3402815	3404536	So it's a buddy game.
3406097	3415243	Alright, well let's move on Oh, quickly, I'm going to close out the poll here Here's the final results of our poll The winner, why did EA get rid of the online pass?
3415604	3429274	57% of the vote, there's something about the new consoles Second place, they're going to rely on increased DLC So there you go, those are the results of the live poll Thank you guys for voting at live.vognetwork.com Let's move on to the next story, DarkSakra
3430951	3435693	In other news, now this is probably why I've had Sega on the brain for a little while.
3437694	3442395	Sega is, well we've always known that Sega's been in bed with Nintendo.
3442916	3447337	We have no idea what they're doing in this bed, but they're doing stuff.
3447718	3454940	In this case, Sega has announced that they are in an exclusive partnership with Nintendo of America.
3455000	3456261	They are gay married to Nintendo.
3457625	3458426	Thanks for watching!
3479617	3485927	The third one is still to be announced, but these are Wii U and 3DS.
3486528	3491135	They're saying that it would be the ideal platform, that's a quote, to showcase Sonic.
3492637	3501739	Of course, though, since people aren't buying Wii U's, Sega is once again showing that their business sense is kind of in the U.S.
3502379	3504380	And this is Sega of America and Sega Europe.
3504420	3508700	I didn't see the official Sega of Japan.
3509040	3510801	Is this really a big deal, though?
3510881	3515802	Because, I mean, Sonic games, not known for their quality these days so much.
3516622	3520765	They've had several Sonic games that have been exclusive to the Nintendo platform.
3520805	3523107	Sonic Colors, Sonic and the Secret Rings.
3523427	3525809	Mario and Sonic and the Olympics, which sells really well.
3525869	3526849	Those games sell very well.
3527750	3529611	Yeah.
3530232	3533834	Which is one of those three games they're doing, which makes sense.
3533914	3536997	But yeah, it sold well because the Wii sold well, right?
3538157	3539598	Yeah, definitely.
3540599	3541580	But the Wii U's not.
3541600	3541700	Right.
3543234	3546079	Well, that's going to suck for Sega then, I guess.
3546099	3552851	Because Sega's really had, especially Sega of America, had a great track record.
3554036	3571528	I wish they'd come out and said it's going to be Phantasy Star Online 2 that's going to be on the Wii U that would have given me something to get really excited about which I'm surprised something like that isn't happening well you never know E3 might be interesting speaking of which Rob you need to play that with me on PC is there an English patch yet for that?
3571929	3580755	yeah it's mostly English it's English enough that you could be able to play it I might have to do that we'll see it's actually super fun it's exactly like the last one so it's good
3581600	3592446	Shadow Next Gen in our chatroom with an interesting perspective saying, Rob, with Nintendo helping to work on Sonic now, though, maybe it will have that magic Nintendo polish that a lot of first-party Nintendo titles have.
3593927	3596848	Could Nintendo's involvement make this sweeter?
3598649	3602431	And actually, I do have to make a slight rebuttal, which I've said in the chatroom.
3602711	3604472	Sonic Generations was pretty damn good.
3604953	3605653	Okay, fair enough.
3606073	3608234	But it was also out on multiple platforms.
3608475	3608955	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
3609917	3611138	I've got it on PC.
3611198	3612679	It's fun on PC.
3614340	3615661	I don't think it's going to make a difference.
3615701	3617823	It just has to not be a turd of a game.
3619784	3623387	What was the last really big turd in the Sonic franchise?
3623987	3624687	Sonic Adventure 2?
3625388	3626829	No, Sonic Adventure 2 was okay.
3627569	3628690	The first Sonic Adventure was good.
3628770	3629531	Sonic 4.
3629831	3631952	It was a huge turd.
3633934	3636876	It didn't even do much in the way of
3638351	3638951	being fun.
3639271	3639992	It just wasn't.
3640852	3649635	So, um, Tigerclaw theorizes in our chat room, what if part of the deal with Sega was that one of the Nintendo characters makes a cameo somewhere in the new Sonic game?
3650215	3650595	Oh boy.
3651035	3652676	Do you think that plumber can run that fast?
3654396	3655476	Anything's possible.
3655957	3656757	Anything's possible.
3657997	3658377	All right.
3658497	3661398	So we will see what happens with this partnership.
3662478	3664379	Some other stuff coming out of the Nintendo Direct, though.
3664439	3664699	Loki?
3664859	3673401	Yeah, they finally announced a date for Wonderful 101, which is on September 15th in North America and August 23rd in Europe.
3674521	3676042	And that's all they said about it.
3677382	3678223	So fantastic.
3678443	3682987	Also, Super Luigi U, the DLC is arriving on the 20th of June.
3683568	3692335	And then if you don't want to get it as DLC, you can pay an extra $10 and get a standalone disc, which is coming out August 25th.
3693656	3698901	I think the reason they're doing that is just to say, hey, look, we have games coming out for the Wii U. Because...
3700549	3702090	I don't know why else they would do that.
3702790	3707232	I kind of figured they would do that later on when they do a Game of the Year edition of New Super Mario Bros.
3707352	3712594	with New Luigi U. Because again, not every household in America is online.
3713634	3717996	Granted, if you're not online, but you have a Wii U, I'm not sure how that works.
3718016	3725539	You must live in a real remote part of the US or something, but I think there's enough people without online that justify it.
3726399	3730241	Also, the Wii U could be in a kid's bedroom, which maybe doesn't have online or something, you know?
3730669	3731069	I guess.
3732270	3734932	But they're putting it out, so I guess that's kind of cool.
3735472	3745238	And then last but not least, this is kind of neat because I'm not going to E3, so you get to play unreleased Wii U games at Best Buy during E3.
3745278	3747519	They're going to have demo kiosks at over 100 locations.
3749140	3749160	E3
3772600	3776725	Very interesting how Nintendo is really changing up the E3 strategy this year.
3776765	3787977	I mean, granted, we had a couple years ago, and I think this still happens to some extent, Microsoft, I remember one year, went very big on bringing E3 home where you could download all the demos and so forth.
3788077	3789519	I really wish they would do that.
3789639	3789839	MOTOGP
3805606	3806887	and now they don't do that anymore.
3807127	3815352	I mean, I really wish they would do that because a lot of, well, the majority of the people that are paying attention to E3 can't go to that.
3815553	3819575	Why do you think Nintendo is making you go to Best Buy and not just letting you download them to your Wii U?
3819735	3820256	Partnership.
3821356	3848046	I bet it's part partnership and it's also part so you can get the sales pitch while you're there about picking up a Wii U because you know Nintendo has just like Microsoft and just like any other company has the people who go out to the stores they're trying to sell the console too because the problem isn't getting people that own the Wii U to buy more games it's getting people to buy the Wii U so why not have those people in the stores ready to try to sell the consoles I think it's a great concept
3850339	3851580	Don't you want to buy a console today?
3852881	3857645	Especially if they end up dropping the price, which I know is a long shot, but now it's on sale.
3857685	3858866	It's even cheaper than it was before.
3858886	3859526	Don't you want to get one?
3860687	3862509	Have somebody there to put on a little bit of that pressure.
3863269	3866932	Do you think we'll see a Wii U Animal Crossing this year?
3867192	3868413	A Wii U Animal Crossing?
3868573	3869794	No, not with the 3DS.
3869854	3874798	It would cannibalize the 3DS one too much because that one is going to be coming out within weeks of E3.
3874978	3876720	Yeah, probably next year.
3877182	3879003	Like it's really going to be anything innovative.
3879283	3879823	Yeah, right?
3879843	3881124	Well, you can sit down now.
3882564	3882824	Ooh!
3883164	3883565	You know what?
3883625	3884665	I could sit down before.
3884685	3888066	I could go get a latte and sit down.
3888346	3890007	But now you can... What were the other big things?
3890027	3890927	There's benches.
3890947	3892348	You're the mayor.
3892948	3893749	You can swim.
3893849	3898871	Well, they... Okay, so to be fair, they did kind of change the main plot of sorts.
3899111	3903993	Yeah, I'm sorry, but... Did it have virtual console games like it did in the GameCube version?
3904033	3904973	Because that was awesome.
3905549	3916837	I actually liked my indentured servitude to Tom Nook and considering that we're selling virtual console games for 30 cents why can't you put some NES games in there?
3916877	3918418	It's not like you're losing money on that
3920086	3920346	Yeah, yeah.
3949861	3951822	Who needs PR when you've got people to do it for free?
3952262	3952802	Exactly.
3953702	3954202	Exactly.
3954643	3955603	So it's going to be interesting.
3955623	3958324	I'm curious to see how this works out for them because it could be a game changer.
3958704	3968007	I am not going to sit here, though, and say E3 is dead or dying because there was a time when E3 didn't have anything to do with the media and all this stuff.
3968087	3970568	Before the internet, there was still E3.
3970928	3976790	And granted, you would see screenshots and things in Nintendo Power, but it was not the blowout thing that it is today.
3977611	3982436	E3 started because it's the one time during the year when everybody in the industry kind of gets together under the same roof.
3982696	3986620	And there's a lot of wheeling and dealing that happens at E3 that the media doesn't even know about.
3987221	3988042	Like, think about it.
3989143	3993007	One year I went to E3, I think it was 2006, maybe it was, it might have been 2010, I don't know.
3993188	3994950	Apple had a booth at E3, or excuse me,
3995530	3995990	Not a booth.
3996390	3998271	Apple had a conference room at E3.
3998651	4000072	It was a behind closed doors thing.
4000092	4003293	And a lot of people were thinking, ooh, is Apple doing a game console?
4003353	4004433	Ooh, ooh, you know, and that whole thing.
4004933	4009495	No, Apple was probably showing off the iPhone or the iPad, depending on whatever year it was.
4009815	4013996	That's probably what they were showing in that little room to developers who were there at the same roof.
4014496	4015917	That had nothing to do with the media.
4016017	4022499	Apple was not rolling that out to the media yet, but Apple was probably trying, again, this is a huge theory here because I don't know anything, but
4022959	4029381	I'm assuming that that's part of the wheeling and dealing that happens at E3 that has nothing to do with the media interaction.
4030141	4032942	The media could not come to E3 and E3 I think would still happen.
4033342	4037223	It might not be as big of a deal, but I think there would still be the necessity for the show.
4038483	4040364	So, anyhow, tangent.
4041484	4044685	But let's move on with something that doesn't have to do with Nintendo.
4045705	4048506	It has to do with Steam, which we brought up earlier in the show.
4048806	4049266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4069804	4074888	Steam Trading Cards Steam Trading Cards Steam Trading Cards Steam Trading Cards Steam Trading Cards Steam Trading Cards
4097387	4097928	Thanks for watching!
4112535	4142081	Dota and Half-Life which you would expect of course the Valve games are going to be involved but they do have Don't Starve and Counter-Strike Global Offensive so at least there's some other games participating but I would like to see more third parties kind of get in on this to really give value added to this and I didn't really understand how it works either as far as like see here's the thing I went back to play Portal 2 I was actually just going to play Portal 2 and I noticed I don't have any of my achievements on Portal 2 like they all disappeared somehow what?
4142401	4144081	Yeah, that's weird.
4144881	4148742	So I started playing it again, but I haven't gotten any cards or anything.
4148802	4155683	And then today I got a notification saying that I got some new items in my inventory.
4155763	4161605	And so now I have three items marked as Steam Trading Card Beta Access.
4161685	4169286	And it says, Steam Trading Card Beta Access Extra Copy Grants Early Access to Steam Trading Card Beta Game Badges and New Profile Cards.
4169446	4173110	Join Steam Trade Carding Group and post your feedback in the discussions area.
4173290	4180839	Select add to my game library to activate, which I tried to do because I didn't see it on my library and it won't let me do that.
4181319	4184803	You need to send one of those to the username I just private messaged you.
4186525	4187326	So I can check that out.
4187346	4187846	I will do that.
4188266	4188887	Hooray.
4189647	4189947	All right.
4190768	4194230	What do you think of the whole thing as a concept, though?
4194250	4196152	Let's just assume it works as we read it.
4196272	4196672	It's neat.
4196712	4198333	It's more interesting than trophies.
4198413	4200034	I mean, because a lot of times it's like an achievement.
4200815	4202076	Yeah, just bring value to that.
4202996	4208620	I noticed Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying, you can buy the trading cards through the Steam Community Market.
4209220	4210901	And he says, I sold two extra passes.
4211102	4212643	I got $1.50 for each.
4213663	4216185	It's like selling stuff in the Diablo real money auction house.
4216986	4219531	Except Valve didn't probably take a dollar out of that.
4221395	4221956	Sounds interesting.
4223339	4226365	I guess any excuse to go back and play Portal and Half-Life and all that, right?
4226886	4227928	Let's move on, DarkSakura.
4228908	4232590	Well, this is something that has my hubby super, super excited.
4232650	4236751	In fact, he was practically bouncing in his seat over this.
4237312	4245235	Gran Turismo 6 has been announced, and there's a demo going to be out in July.
4247056	4254419	The information actually hit, I think, the European Sony news networks not too long ago.
4256600	4264244	They're saying that it's going to be on the PS3 and that they're basically going to keep it on that system.
4264625	4269127	They don't say anything about it being out for the next-gen system.
4269207	4273289	They're going to have GT Academy in 2013 as well.
4274550	4279533	And that this new version is going to have 1,200 cars, 33 locations, and 71 layouts.
4280393	4283415	So that's seven more locations than Gran Turismo 5 had.
4283575	4285636	And it will have the UK Silverstone Circuit.
4288206	4288426	Hmm.
4289567	4289727	Wow.
4289787	4294789	It says new physics engine, new modeling, all kinds of stuff.
4296150	4296730	Did you hear that?
4297091	4297331	No.
4297831	4299152	Dan goes, and I will buy it.
4299732	4302834	He came in, raised his hands in the air and goes, and I will buy it.
4302874	4305455	Well, interesting though that it's not PlayStation 4.
4305935	4308837	I think that's the thing that really shocked people is that, well...
4310358	4313861	PlayStation 4 has this whole racing club or what do they call that game?
4315102	4315542	Drive club.
4315683	4316463	Drive club or whatever.
4316703	4318064	But yet there's no Gran Turismo.
4318985	4320706	And this is going to be on the PlayStation 3.
4322748	4328252	Without the PlayStation 4 being backwards compatible, Gran Turismo 6 is a great reason not to upgrade.
4329653	4331375	Yeah, but also put it out this way.
4331435	4335198	If you want to guarantee sales, why not put it out for the system that everyone already has?
4335899	4341042	Well, yeah, but that's going to be a problem when the new systems start coming to get people to buy them.
4341722	4342443	I don't think so.
4342623	4349306	I think that they're going to have maybe some special edition come out later that everyone's going to go, ooh, we need this instead.
4350087	4351547	Gran Turismo 6 HD or something?
4352208	4353348	Something like that.
4353469	4362053	WhatUpG in our chat says, each of the PlayStation systems have had two main Gran Turismo games, so I expect PlayStation 4 to have Gran Turismo 7 and 8.
4362613	4365195	So maybe there's just a pattern that's trying to not be broken here.
4366422	4368484	That's a good point.
4368724	4372667	And actually, they were saying that for Gran Turismo 5, 10 million copies were sold.
4374288	4381533	And that it is the Gran Turismo franchise itself is their most successful franchise ever, especially in Europe.
4383374	4386536	70 million copies over the span of the series.
4387717	4388117	Alright.
4389778	4391900	I think it's a wise move to put it on PS3.
4393431	4395956	I guess, but it's very strange.
4396036	4405113	It seems a little bit like cannibalizing PlayStation 4, but I guess they feel there'll still be plenty of people wanting to pick up a PlayStation 4 for Drive Club, so I don't know.
4405714	4417076	See, I have a feeling that they're going to really push Gran Turismo 7 for PS4 and make that a big selling point like around, say, some sort of major holiday or big sales period.
4417096	4423698	Yeah, but it's just weird to me that Gran Turismo 6 and Drive Club for PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 4 are all around the same time, essentially.
4424138	4424698	It's weird.
4424738	4429139	They're saying that they may release another version of PlayStation 4 later on after launch.
4429459	4429779	Of course.
4430559	4432300	See, that's pretty much what I was anticipating.
4433600	4439483	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that will be coming out a little bit sooner than Gran Turismo 6, as in games that are out this week.
4439543	4441384	And we'll start with Loki in the U.S.
4442364	4444545	This week, there's actually quite a few things.
4445765	4451808	Starting off, Resident Evil Revelations HD is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.
4455209	4483968	and then I know the game that everybody is super excited for Fast and the Furious Showdown which is being developed by the guys that did the NASCAR games that's coming out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360 the Wii U and the 3DS and then there's the Worms Collection which is kind of a re-release of some of the Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network games that's coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 this week
4485749	4500294	Also, LEGO Batman 2 DC Super Heroes on the Wii U. And on the 3DS, on Friday actually, we'll be getting Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D.
4500974	4503895	And that's going to be coming out as well.
4504215	4509836	And last game this week, Sniper Elite V2 on the Wii U. So hey, there's Wii U games coming out.
4510417	4513198	Unfortunately, they are games that have come out a long time ago, like a year ago.
4513478	4513598	So...
4517293	4521555	All right, let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases that are going to happen over there.
4522916	4526577	Starting off with the PlayStation 3 this week on May 23rd.
4527338	4529399	Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition.
4530519	4533741	BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend, which is getting a price cut.
4533781	4535202	That's going into the Best Hits Collection.
4535782	4540724	Kamen Rider Batride War in regular and premium editions is out this week from Namco Bandai.
4541105	4541725	I would play that.
4541885	4543326	As they call it over there, Bandai Namco.
4544206	4551230	Terraria is getting a Japanese release, believe it or not, and that will be out this week as well as The Sims 3 Pets getting a price reduction on PlayStation 3.
4552271	4558614	Also on PS3 this week, Z slash X, Zillions of Enemy X, Zetsukai no Crusade.
4558995	4563457	Yes, that is Zillions of Enemy X. How many?
4563837	4564498	Zillions.
4566027	4567108	Robby just made me sad.
4567388	4567628	Why?
4568488	4570969	Because that just makes me actually want a zillion game.
4572430	4574651	Like on Master System, only all updated and new.
4575292	4581775	On the Xbox 360 this week, Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is there as well in a regular and a limited set.
4581835	4583856	That's pretty much all you get on the 360 this week.
4584696	4588898	Going to the Vita, BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend also gets a price cut there.
4589318	4594541	And Valhalla Knights 3 comes out this week from Marvelous Entertainment over in Japan.
4595321	4597182	Check out the Wii U. Yes, there is a game.
4597242	4600562	It's Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is out there as well.
4600642	4602343	So all the consoles in Japan getting that.
4603283	4608204	On the 3DS this week, there is a new 3DS XL model, or as they call it, the LL.
4608304	4614666	It's the Shimogami Tensei IV Limited model because Shimogami Tensei IV is out this week in Japan.
4614706	4615766	That's going to be a pretty big release.
4616386	4618267	I'm sure there's some people going to be importing that one.
4618987	4621148	You can actually get that retail or download.
4621188	4622588	There's a whole accessory set.
4622808	4628629	You can get a skin for your... If you're a Shin Megami Tensei fan, you're probably importing tons of shit this week from Japan.
4629349	4630349	Good luck to your wallet.
4631270	4638131	If you are not a Shin Megami Tensei fan, perhaps Tamagotchi no Doki Doki Dream Omesechi would be of interest to you.
4638231	4641092	Yes, it's another Tamagotchi game on the 3DS.
4642772	4645876	I think you should just get Shin Megami Tensei IV if you're going to import one or the other.
4646637	4647058	Just saying.
4647859	4651723	Lastly, on the PSP, yes, they are still making games for the PSP in Japan.
4653225	4660594	Zeroji no Kane to Cinderella Halloween Wedding in regular and deluxe editions and Rakuun Danshi coming out.
4661435	4662776	What is Cinderella Wedding?
4662796	4665137	That is not, I don't think the Disney Cinderella.
4665177	4669440	This looks like one of those games based off an anime.
4669620	4679486	Oh God, it looks like one of those romance games because I see girl and guy in the bar, girl hanging off guy, guy kissing girl and all this stuff.
4679526	4681607	So it must be one of those series.
4683108	4684549	All right, that's it for Japan.
4684629	4686030	Let's travel over to the UK.
4687308	4690872	On the 22nd, we have the Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.
4690912	4692053	Midna, stop eating that!
4692613	4692874	Sorry.
4693554	4695456	Midna was eating my headphone cable.
4698059	4710471	On the 24th, we have Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, Dust and the Lesion Tale, Fast and Furious Showdown, Big Whoop, Resident Evil Revelations, and Sniper Elite V2.
4713379	4718165	to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
4718566	4720308	Use the passphrase, test.
4721049	4721370	All right.
4722451	4723332	There it is, UK.
4723372	4727117	Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4727838	4727999	Loki.
4728759	4736521	Alright, so Nintendo has kind of taken an action against these Let's Play videos on YouTube.
4737261	4754785	What's going to happen is partnering, I guess, with YouTube, they're going to be using their content ID match system to basically take the ad revenue that these Let's Play videos are getting
4757387	4772646	if they're monetized and that's all going to be going to Nintendo and then also they're going to be having ads I guess before and after the videos as well I guess it's going to somehow automatically get added in for Nintendo stuff
4773726	4799052	um so that kind of sucks I guess um although I mean I know YouTube has policies against the let's play stuff you know although there's still a ton of it on there and it's kind of you know confusing because some companies will let you do let's plays on their stuff like Minecraft for example there's a big thing in saying hey do film whatever you want do whatever you want you know we're not gonna it's it's cool you know so um
4800669	4815244	and I know other they're not taking the videos down but I mean the fact that they're kind of like hey we're taking all the profits from it that's kind of like I almost wish they would just take them down instead you know what I mean it's kind of a little weird mm-hmm
4816425	4817566	Well, here's the thing.
4817646	4823171	Well, the thing I was most surprised to learn from this whole story is that there's people that make livings off of doing Let's Play videos.
4823331	4825693	I had no idea you could make that kind of money on YouTube.
4826074	4827735	And I'm like, wow, I'm in the wrong business.
4828236	4831478	Apparently, I need to do some sassy Let's Play videos or something.
4831579	4839626	I was joking with Rob saying that, hey, because I do monetize some of the videos I make for YouTube just...
4840206	4847113	First hits and giggles because I know I'm not going to get millions of hits on it, but hey, let's just see what kind of money we'll rake in from this.
4847874	4854000	With the few videos that I have, and a few of them have like a thousand views or something, a whopping 26 cents.
4855421	4855742	Nice.
4856042	4856503	Yeah.
4857083	4857804	I'm retiring.
4858144	4859806	Do you think Nintendo is evil for what they did?
4861570	4862550	I don't think it's a good idea.
4862731	4875036	I mean, I understand that they're saying, oh, you guys shouldn't be making money off of our content, but it's less about making money off their content and more of just like it's commentary and stuff.
4875096	4887021	You can't really do a Let's Play video or a commentary on gameplay without showing the gameplay, unless you have some sort of weird riff tracks thing that you do.
4887601	4909700	I've seen a lot of anger directed at Nintendo on the internet this week over this whole thing and it's like okay to some extent I do get it and I feel I can understand where the YouTube community feels a little bit slighted on this and I can certainly understand hey this is the internet and we can just pick up and move it to somewhere else you know I'm sure there's a lot of that talk going on right now but you guys Microsoft did this in October of last year and
4910680	4922785	In fact, I believe it was October 9th was the date the news went out is that Microsoft now they did something a little different, but they actually put it in their whole little terms of service that you cannot earn money from these games like Halo 4 and so forth.
4923085	4928447	And that if you cannot enroll in a YouTube partner program, if you are playing one of these Microsoft games.
4928507	4940478	but here's how that's I just think a lot of gamers forgot about that in their anger because everybody's like oh Nintendo's just doing this because the Wii U sucks and all this stuff and I'm like well Microsoft did the same fucking thing seven months ago does that mean the 360 sucks?
4940738	4954070	but they do this they're doing this now and then and of course we don't know it's confirmed yet but the rumor is they're going to be kind of rolling out the same features that the PlayStation 4 has where you can share videos and gameplay and stuff
4955671	4968300	If they have it where you can live stream and do commentary over that stuff, you're not going to be able to monetize those videos that you put out there even though they're making it super easy for you to do that.
4968420	4974384	They just want you to freely advertise their game without any sort of... That's the thing.
4974804	4976065	You're kind of advertising their game.
4976105	4976666	It's not like you...
4977466	4978086	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4995832	4999674	But those interactions were designed by Nintendo.
5000414	5002155	That's the place I fault that argument.
5002395	5003856	You want the word to get out of every game.
5003896	5004977	You want your game to look fun.
5004997	5005997	You want it to get out to the people.
5006057	5011900	Whether they're seeing it like if I come over and watch someone playing a game, how's that any different than watching it over the internet?
5012020	5035249	I'm not saying I necessarily disagree completely that Nintendo made a bad decision with this but I also think there's a lot of gamer entitlement going on here that you guys if it was a movie do you think I could put up a copy of Star Trek Into Darkness with my commentary on YouTube and not have that get struck down with probably something a lot worse than the monetary it would be a copyright strike
5036470	5043454	If I were to put something up, you know who's really fucking crazy about their intellectual property is sports.
5043815	5046356	The NBA and the NFL, especially the NFL.
5046676	5053101	If I were to put up classic football clips and be talking over them and stuff, they would come after me, legally.
5053221	5055482	It would be a lot worse than what Nintendo's doing here.
5056463	5064528	I kind of think there's gamer entitlement going on here, and this is just a rude awakening, and I'm sorry, but I think gamers are getting it a lot better
5065869	5090099	some of these other well Rob also keep in mind like for another example this is the Rift Tracks guys have to get licensing which and they don't even don't they just do their sales that they don't attach well they don't have to get licensing they only have to get licensing for when they're actually doing like a show like an actual movie in a theater with you know the Rift Tracks the most of the stuff they do is in the public domain now
5091001	5092262	Thank you for watching!
5108155	5118622	People, the whole reason that you're having this share thing on the PlayStation 4 and stuff is to kind of, you want to share those moments with your friends and stuff like that.
5118722	5126446	But if you're going to start saying, okay, we want you to get that footage out there, get that footage out there, and then start hammering them down.
5126587	5129528	Oh, well, I'm sorry, but that footage was too long.
5129608	5132030	I'm sorry, but you're trying to make some money off of this.
5133390	5147498	They're not going to be motivated to continue doing those Let's Play videos if they're going to make no money off of it because they're trying to put out content and if you're saying, well, you can't make any money off this, that's basically...
5148894	5154156	I know it's a little stretch, but it's almost like saying, we're telling you what you can and can't do with this game.
5154496	5155997	Like, oh, sorry, you can't sell it used.
5156257	5157657	We're telling you what you can and can't do.
5157797	5165380	In part, that's where I do agree with you, is that this wasn't a smart PR move on Nintendo's part on a time where they need a lot of good news.
5165840	5174266	And I think what should happen here, and this is probably a limitation of YouTube, quite honestly, is that maybe there needs to be something where it's a split revenue stream or something like that.
5174326	5184373	But, Loki, if people are making money, they're making a living off of Let's Play videos, that tells me, what, $40,000 a year minimum, right, to live off of.
5184393	5186875	You got maybe, in some parts of the country, $30,000 or less.
5187015	5187395	I don't know.
5187715	5192419	But you're talking, multiply that by how many people on YouTube are doing it for a living.
5192439	5192419	50?
5192459	5193179	100?
5192719	5193179	But that's...
5195120	5196741	It's a lot of views.
5197141	5199043	A lot of views required.
5199323	5201444	It's like thousands of views to get a penny.
5202024	5202825	I mean, seriously.
5203305	5208268	In fact, I'm going to look it up right now because I can look at my monetization and see what exactly I'm...
5210589	5230978	bringing in I guess yeah but again you know I and I'm not dissing the talent of these individuals and they're funny witty stuff and so forth because that would be kind of biting the hand that you know makes up this show here but uh then again we're not displaying images of the game in motion the whole time during the during the show or whatever I don't know I don't know
5231718	5235343	Yeah, but it's stupid though that they... We're also not trying to make a living off of it.
5235363	5248142	Well, here's the problem too is they basically say, okay, yeah, we're going to have this partnership program that we're going to partner with IGN or something like that or Machinima or something like that.
5248542	5266245	and then you have to become an affiliate with them but they may not let you become an affiliate with them so once again you're given these big guys how's an indie supposed to shine if you're just saying sorry you can't show any of our gameplay we only want IGN to show our gameplay find another way to monetize it
5267762	5269584	But how do you do that?
5270325	5272047	If I knew, I would have the money.
5272107	5279596	I'm saying, though, that if there's another way to monetize it, they're going to still hit you for the same thing, that you're making money off of our videos or off our content.
5280938	5285263	What if it's like PayPal donations or something like that for a Twitch stream or something?
5285723	5291747	I'm sure people make money off of that, but I don't know.
5291867	5305797	I think if there's going to be a standardized way that people are going to make money off of videos, whether it be monetization via ads or whatever, maybe they can cater those ads for those Nintendo videos to Nintendo products.
5306617	5307198	Something like that.
5307258	5308739	That seems to make more sense to me.
5309028	5321577	Yeah, I do think, again, I think the smarter thing for Nintendo to do would have been to partner with these people to come to a solution that has both people in mind.
5321617	5326061	Either it's split revenue or it's ads that support Nintendo or whatever it is.
5326241	5329243	But by putting the hammer down, they made themselves look like dicks.
5329603	5332706	But my point is they are well within their legal right to do so.
5332966	5335048	And I think people need to...
5335948	5337809	Give Nintendo a little bit of a break here.
5338090	5344354	When you hear about that people are making a living off of this, Nintendo is entitled to some of that money.
5344434	5345194	I'm rolling the money.
5345374	5347396	I just made 7 more cents.
5347576	5348917	I'm at 31 cents.
5349817	5352960	Here's a good example right here.
5353780	5364627	Some of the videos I've been uploading, like different Ouya videos and stuff like that, the one that I have the most views on so far is a how to sideload apps tutorial, I guess.
5364667	5365468	It's only a few minutes long.
5366108	5375671	I have 2,170 views, 6,977 minutes, 24 cents is what I've made off of that.
5375751	5378932	Just to give you an idea of how many views you're going to get.
5378952	5383534	You have to get millions and millions of views combined over your channel.
5383694	5384874	It's going to take a lot of work.
5386075	5389376	Nobody putting out a Let's Play video is not going to make...
5390496	5392819	A ton of money, and they really want that ad money?
5393019	5394260	I mean, really?
5394461	5399907	You want that, like, maybe a buck that they're gonna make if they get thousands of views?
5400047	5400908	I mean, seriously?
5401609	5402830	That seems a little greedy.
5403130	5406014	Alright, going to a couple more chat comments here, and then we gotta move on with the show.
5406034	5407035	But SSJ100Matt says...
5407355	5410157	ShadowNextGen says, The people who make these videos might take a few hours to make them.
5410437	5415480	They don't have the right to make money off of the new Zelda title that Nintendo took years and millions of dollars to make.
5437295	5437329	Thanks for watching!
5438991	5451600	Yeah, but look at what kind of money is Nintendo making off their title versus the amount of effort Nintendo's putting into their title versus the return versus the person that spent like an hour to make a video and his return.
5451921	5455163	I think it's fair because you look at the amount of money that they're making.
5455643	5459706	It's not like the guy that's making the Let's Play video is making more money than Nintendo on these titles.
5460147	5465291	I mean, I just don't see where Nintendo is necessarily losing money on this.
5465671	5468353	Are they suggesting that people are watching these Let's Plays and going...
5468733	5469794	That's enough of that game.
5469894	5470875	I don't need to buy it now.
5471256	5471576	I'm sorry.
5471596	5473979	That's just like saying, oh, hey, someone pirated our game.
5473999	5474699	We lost the sale.
5475720	5477462	You can't attribute that.
5477822	5481466	There's no data to correlate lost sales.
5481606	5487172	Make all the excuses you want, but the fact of the matter is your system's not selling well because you don't have any games on it.
5487832	5494857	MM2K says, YouTube just needs to establish a standard fee against revenue of anyone using copyrighted material, maybe 5-10%.
5495777	5509086	Again though, I mean, I'm with you on that for like games, but like movies, I can't post a copy of Star Trek Into Darkness on YouTube and expect that, you know, oh Paramount gets 5-10% because I'm giving my sassy commentary over this movie that just came out.
5509546	5509806	You know?
5511968	5512088	It's...
5512828	5514129	There's got to be something there.
5514389	5517792	Here's what needs to happen, and this is, I think, would be, this would be fun.
5518332	5523957	Nintendo needs to be one of those companies, like Mojang, with Minecraft, saying, hey, you know what?
5524857	5531963	We're cool with you putting the videos out there and, you know, do with whatever, but if you monetize our videos, then maybe that they...
5532563	5532963	Thanks for watching!
5548770	5552912	I think that would be fair enough because they're getting their products out there and they're advertised.
5553212	5562577	The people are more inclined to put out these videos to spread the word about these Nintendo games.
5564038	5568220	For example, if I haven't played New Super Mario Bros.
5568380	5571481	U and I watch some Let's Play videos, I'm like, hey, that looks like a pretty fun game.
5571762	5572502	Maybe I should go buy it.
5574289	5580353	If you're going to try to get these people not to put these videos out there, I'm never going to hear about this game.
5583995	5594582	My final thought on this whole thing is that, again, although Nintendo maybe didn't have the best timing with this sort of move, this is not something that's going to be limited to Nintendo, and it is not limited to Nintendo.
5594622	5595682	Again, Microsoft did it.
5595802	5599324	Sega did it with the whole Shining Force or something.
5599545	5601546	This one random game, they were taking down all these videos.
5602427	5614437	This is still a new media that a lot of companies are exploring, and I'm sorry, but if you are just using this to further your Nintendo hate boner, you need to spread the hate around equally.
5614717	5618440	Your position needs to be the same for all these companies that are doing it.
5618921	5625827	So that's kind of one of my big things with this, is that at least if you're going to be mad, be mad at everybody.
5626963	5632847	All right, let's move on and do one more story here before the classic game of the week.
5633407	5635289	And hooray, it's a porn story.
5635429	5636109	Yay.
5636309	5637190	Kids like porn.
5637410	5638070	Yay.
5639491	5639892	Here it is.
5640312	5643574	Hardcore pornography apparently coming to the next Xbox.
5643794	5645515	At least that's what the headlines all say.
5645735	5646056	Yeah.
5646136	5647296	Here's what it's really about.
5647376	5647657	All right.
5648037	5649058	Sugar DVD.
5649758	5653941	You know, they do films like Hairy Asian Schoolgirls Masturbate.
5654241	5654841	That's a thing.
5654861	5655822	Yeah.
5656082	5658265	I think that's just a made up title.
5672501	5672821	Outro Music
5698914	5702436	Is there really a porn called Don't Tell My Wife I Ass Fucked the Babysitter?
5703436	5704517	That's a pretty great parody.
5704957	5706878	I think that's Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead.
5706898	5708219	That's like a little parody on that.
5708759	5709960	That sounds hilarious.
5710600	5711981	I think that's actually a real porn.
5712161	5712761	There you go.
5714042	5716243	Well, you'll find out on the new Xbox very soon.
5717224	5719785	Here's the quote from SugarDVD's Rebecca Bolin.
5720465	5725468	Any console would benefit from having unlimited HD adult content at the click of a button.
5728490	5729791	DarkSakura, did you hear that?
5729871	5731252	All you gotta do is click your mouse.
5732632	5734393	Yay!
5736094	5736294	Yes.
5736334	5737775	By the way, Rob, that does exist.
5737815	5738336	I looked it up.
5738776	5739736	It is an actual, yes.
5741137	5742618	I was gonna say, they have a lot of them.
5743311	5745232	My search history is hilarious.
5745392	5747134	What was that one New Year's Eve?
5747194	5763444	It was got to be 2006 or 2007 where we were looking up the pornography on the Nintendo Wii web browser and looking at what like Xtube and we found the pterodactyl porn which was a guy in a pterodactyl suit having sex with some girl and it was hilarious.
5764245	5766046	Just the little motions the guy would make.
5766366	5772170	And then we were trying to look up for some reason we were looking up donkey punch and there was a guy dressed up like a donkey.
5772310	5773211	That would actually punch, yeah.
5774191	5798796	hilarious when in doubt more porn stories all right let's uh let's travel to a time when you know you know a porn game porn on the console was Custer's Revenge and Bubble Bath Babes and Miss Nude World 96 that was that was porn in gaming it's the classic game of the week where DarkSakura is going to walk into her classic gaming vault and she can do that tonight she's literally right there
5799396	5804641	and find a game that she says, hey, you kids should be playing this game, damn it.
5805122	5810127	Now, I don't think she picked a porno game, so don't get too excited, but DarkSakura picked something just as good as a porno.
5810687	5811668	What's the classic game of the week?
5812208	5819816	Today's classic game is Hagane, The Final Conflict, which is not a game that came out widespread in America.
5819856	5822718	It was one of those blockbuster-only games like Final Fight Guy.
5824053	5825614	And so this is a game I do not own.
5826395	5829697	I would love to own it, however, it is $700 on eBay right now.
5830117	5830778	Holy moly.
5831318	5832499	Yeah, I'm not even joking.
5834400	5835841	Let me get some of the audio from the game here.
5837474	5841558	It came out in 1994, and it's a side-scrolling action game.
5842599	5847624	It was developed by Keita Amemiya and Red Entertainment.
5847664	5849986	I almost said Redertainment, you know, one of our listeners.
5851087	5852088	It was Red Entertainment.
5852148	5854771	It was published by Hudson Soft for the Super Nintendo.
5855511	5859976	And like I said, in the US, it was only one of those blockbuster video games.
5860518	5864384	Now, I do have the other blockbuster game, Final Fight Guy.
5864985	5865505	That one goes for 300.
5868257	5881145	So anyway, the story behind this is that the Huma and Koma ninja clans are basically in a big rivalry against each other for the Holy Grail.
5882266	5885227	And the Huma clan is based off of the Chinese Zodiac.
5885267	5896234	And you play this one guy who is in full armor and Dan and I, when Dan was playing because we have a version of it quote version
5897615	5898335	Amulator.
5899316	5899536	Huh?
5900037	5900637	Amulator.
5901138	5902439	Yeah.
5902659	5908905	Dan was talking about some of the resemblance to Strider.
5908965	5911367	I was going to say, you love this game because it's freaking Strider.
5911847	5913429	It's a Strider ripoff.
5913449	5915911	I don't know if Dan likes anything Strider or Strider related.
5915931	5918133	It's Strider meets Shinobi is what I'm looking at here.
5918820	5919100	Yeah.
5919860	5926362	And this is actually a game I would... I don't even care if it's just the Super Famicom version, which is still like 50 bucks on eBay here.
5927442	5931384	I would love to have this game, but the big problem about it is that it's freaking hard!
5932064	5933544	Super hard, and no save.
5934885	5936545	That's why emulators are awesome.
5938346	5939066	Save states.
5940646	5946868	But basically, you're playing as a ninja cyborg.
5947552	5949694	who is going to kill all of the Koma clan.
5949834	5950535	Rawr.
5951556	5958481	And, um, basically it's just a really, really cool side-scrolling game.
5958722	5959482	Very difficult.
5960083	5967269	But one thing that it did get some less-than-stellar reviews on was actually its graphics.
5967389	5971913	It was said not to show off the best of Super Nintendo at the time.
5974008	5978130	So, I don't think Hagane is on Virtual Console.
5978230	5990116	It was sort of... It wasn't really, I mean, considering it was only released to video stores or whatever, it wasn't really... I mean, we haven't seen Final Fight Guy.
5990616	5990956	Yeah.
5991556	5994658	So, yeah, this was a very limited release.
5994678	5997259	You could only rent this game at Blockbuster.
5997279	5997619	Yeah.
5998078	6006064	and then, like I said... Hold on, EricRPG in our chatroom says that they had it at his video store, so it may not have just been Blockbuster, but maybe, like, video stores in general.
6006884	6009947	Well, no, these were actually released only for Blockbuster.
6009967	6013109	If they showed up at other video stores, then they were purchased from Blockbuster.
6013429	6013849	Oh, weird.
6013949	6014230	Okay.
6014750	6014950	Yeah.
6015951	6022736	So, because Blockbuster had, like, a limited release deal just on certain Japanese-only games.
6023076	6023216	Hmm.
6025868	6027409	So this was one of them.
6027810	6030852	And honestly, I would love to have this game in my collection.
6030993	6032394	It's really, really difficult.
6032714	6035336	But a very rich, good side-scrolling game.
6037358	6041682	And don't say fucking Blockbuster because Blockbuster is dead, pretty much.
6042463	6044184	The one around the corner from my house is gone.
6044224	6045105	They are vanishing.
6045405	6050790	I saw one in a strip mall the other day and I was like, oh my god, it's a museum.
6051724	6052024	Yeah.
6053405	6056447	I think that's where I picked up a copy of Parappa 2.
6058509	6061831	Okay, so I'm checking on eBay right now.
6061871	6062371	There's one for $295.
6062411	6062892	One for a buy it now of $700.
6062932	6065193	And another one without the box for $400.
6065233	6066014	A Japanese copy is $45.
6066114	6067175	So, I don't even care.
6067195	6067215	I...
6078154	6078374	Haganay
6093410	6094331	for the Super Nintendo.
6094391	6095052	Good luck finding it.
6095732	6098615	Yeah, and if you find it, give it to me.
6099055	6099516	As a tip.
6100257	6101378	Yeah, because you love me.
6102279	6105742	Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lawn Tradio, but don't go anywhere.
6105782	6110747	We have plenty more to come, including the Fugle Question of the Week, all about this controversial Nintendo Let's Play topic.
6111427	6113528	More stories about EA and Nintendo.
6113788	6118471	We're going to talk a little bit about the stuff from the Google press thing this week that has to do with Nintendo.
6119011	6126955	A couple E3 stories for you guys and plenty more including your phone calls and emails when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6135131	6135792	Hi there!
6136553	6143420	This is Redertainment, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
6144221	6150067	And I want to use my voice to tell you that Garrus ain't got nothing on Samantha Trainor.
6151437	6152177	Shots fired.
6152998	6153998	Watch out, DarkSakura.
6154018	6154498	Shots fired.
6154518	6154798	What?
6156839	6157339	Live.
6158159	6163501	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 505 in progress.
6163581	6167202	Thanks to Red Entertainment for starting shit here on the second half of our show.
6167222	6167863	Appreciate that.
6167903	6174005	If you want to leave a bumper for our show, more information available in our forum at the VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com.
6174265	6175425	We're finally getting a few of them in.
6175465	6177426	I have another new one to play next week, so thanks to you guys.
6178206	6178666	Just Dance 4
6202222	6203503	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6227405	6233652	But I gotta say, I really like, especially in Just Dance 4, well, A, the song list is very, like, what the fuck?
6233772	6245926	Like, there's some really, like, you know, they have the stuff you'd expect to hear, like some top 40 hits, like J-Lo on the floor, and Pink, So What, but then, like, there's these picks, they have a cover of the Time Warp
6246847	6247127	What?
6247508	6248428	Yeah, which is hilarious.
6249029	6251551	They have Army of Lovers with Crucified.
6251571	6252792	I don't know if you guys remember that song.
6252872	6253412	You love that song.
6253432	6254293	Remember that song?
6255774	6258096	Seriously, Google that music video.
6258176	6259317	It is hilarious.
6259357	6260498	That song is in the game.
6260518	6261639	Does it have a video?
6262119	6262920	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6281238	6290940	But I really like that they have these full workout modes where it'll actually do like a kind of like a warm up little like, you know, generic electro beat or whatever you pick.
6290980	6293000	And then you'll do a bunch of songs and you do like a cool down.
6293300	6296901	So it actually the way it think it's not just a bunch of songs on shuffle counting the calories.
6296981	6297361	Pretty cool.
6297421	6298702	Yeah, that I really liked.
6298882	6301882	So for 20 bucks, I was very happy with that.
6302062	6305363	So yeah, that was a game I forgot to mention earlier.
6305523	6305943	So there you go.
6307419	6309360	I guess we can get into some rapid-fire news now, if you want.
6310000	6310180	Sure.
6311000	6323525	So the folks behind The Incredible Machine, which I sunk a lot of hours into back for one of my first computer games, they are making... I love that game, by the way.
6323585	6324945	Yes, it's fantastic.
6325025	6328626	It's like, what do they call those, the Rube Goldberg machines or whatever?
6329387	6335649	Which reminds me, or as everybody knows it, the opening sequence to Pee-Wee's Big Adventure with the Mr. T cereal.
6335669	6335749	Yeah.
6336349	6337609	I'm pitiful, they don't eat my cereal
6366939	6367399	That's awesome.
6367739	6369081	So yeah, they'll be coming out.
6369761	6372283	Probably have to pick that up because I love the Incredible Machine.
6372864	6374285	And this is also cool.
6374645	6377768	Another Kickstarter game called Auto Duel.
6378168	6380210	And it's a multiplayer car combat game.
6380350	6386995	So probably it's a good thing that David Jeff has signed on to help...
6387936	6395859	Make This Game, and on top of that, Zach Norman, the creator of Interstate 76 and Vigilante 8.
6397140	6402982	At least I think he created Vigilante 8, but Vigilante 8, one of my most favorite car combat games.
6403423	6408605	That's a pretty good pedigree right there, so looking forward to that, maybe back that when that comes out.
6411866	6417647	Yeah, I don't know if they've actually released or have this out yet as a Kickstarter.
6417707	6418388	Probably soon, though.
6419428	6424389	And last but not least, the Assassin's Creed movie has a date, or at least a time frame.
6424649	6425089	May 2015.
6425750	6430071	I also saw it was July 2016, beginning of the Angry Birds movie.
6430551	6434832	By then, I don't think Angry Birds will be a thing anymore, or at least anyone will care.
6435052	6435292	Right.
6435692	6437632	I mean, seriously, it's... We can all hope.
6438773	6439233	A long time.
6440374	6446278	Alright, before I get to my rapid-fire stories here, DarkSakura, I see you chatting like crazy in our chatroom tonight.
6446318	6447199	Did I read that right?
6447239	6453584	You said, had I not romanced Garrus in all 17 times, you've beaten Mass Effect.
6454544	6455385	I think it's more than 17.
6456085	6456986	I just made up a number.
6457226	6458727	You might have a problem.
6459448	6460709	No, I don't.
6461209	6461850	Because I've...
6464026	6466028	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
6487495	6488236	Justify, Justify
6511272	6511773	You know what?
6511833	6513674	I'm gonna go play some Japanese Sonic Adventure.
6514015	6515556	I mean, Sonic CD.
6516357	6517217	Just to spite Bobby.
6517578	6519199	I'll livestream that shit.
6519920	6522902	You have fun with that while I read the news about yet another Kickstarter.
6522943	6524144	This is the world we live in, guys.
6524184	6525184	But this is a really cool band.
6525205	6526386	I know a lot of you like these guys.
6527066	6529887	Anna Managucci, the chiptune artist.
6529907	6534289	They have a Kickstarter of their own up for Endless Fantasy.
6534529	6541733	And they're very proud of the fact that they've completed this 22-track album over three years without any help from a label, to which I say, you guys go.
6541793	6542353	That's awesome.
6542833	6545594	And the goal for this, getting the CD out there, $50,000.
6545634	6545714	Yeah.
6547375	6551038	They're sitting just under 200k right now, so safe to say they've met it.
6551438	6561505	Now with 13 days still to go, so if you pay, I believe, 15 or more, you get the CD pre-order of Endless Fantasy and you get the digital download with that.
6561985	6567409	And I know we have some of their tracks in rotation on VOG and great chiptune artists, so congrats guys.
6569311	6572613	I don't know if this game would make $200,000, but it's sure worth a shot.
6573073	6576535	Shaq Fighter is apparently a name that has been trademarked.
6576775	6581618	Oh yes, I'm sure you all remember Shaq Fu, which is what, on Super Nintendo and Genesis, I think as well?
6582158	6592105	Yes, it was the fighting game that starred Shaq, and it's kind of a cult game, but it's one of those games that everybody's like, oh yeah, I remember Shaq Fu, and then you actually play it, and you're like, oh yeah, I remember Shaq Fu.
6592905	6595787	Well, there was also Shackdown, which was a mobile game.
6596047	6596787	They came out with that.
6597107	6609274	Well, now apparently the folks that run the Shack.com website, which I didn't even know existed until now, they registered to trademark for Shack Fighter on May 8th.
6609734	6611835	So I don't know if this is yet another mobile game.
6612256	6616038	Maybe this is the Wii U's killer app that's going to get everybody to buy the console.
6616878	6636031	or maybe it's another mobile game or maybe it's another like attempt at a 50 cent blood in the sand Shaq goes after terrorists perhaps perhaps I don't know but hey Shaq's pretty pretty awesome so this is gonna be it's gonna be worth checking out if nothing else before the lulls
6638092	6641593	Wave Forward, who did the game's Adventure Time.
6641673	6643653	Hey, Ice King, why'd you steal our garbage?
6643813	6653956	And, of course, DuckTailed Remastered, which had everybody screaming like a little girl at PAX East, is going to be doing another Adventure Time game.
6654116	6658077	It's called Adventure Time Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know.
6660498	6661438	I love Adventure Time.
6661897	6665218	Which is pretty much, you know, any video game ever, right?
6665799	6666759	Explore the dungeon.
6666899	6667199	Why?
6667299	6668199	Because I don't know.
6669200	6673201	You will be exploring the secret royal dungeon underneath the Candy Kingdom.
6673381	6676643	And, of course, you can play as Finn, Jake, Marceline, and more.
6676983	6678223	There will be co-op as well.
6678323	6682545	It's going to be out Wii U, 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and 3DS.
6682745	6685066	I'm actually kind of excited about it because the last game was only 3DS.
6685086	6686627	Oh, 3DS and DS.
6688189	6717025	also happening regular show uh Mordecai and Rigby in 8-bit land on the 3ds uh they are Mordecai Mordecai excuse me I don't I don't know this show should I is it really funny it's supposed to be very funny I know Adventure Time I know that one if you like Adventure Time you'd like this show okay is it one of those things that's like funnier if you've you know smoked a certain substance beforehand uh I think it's just the same type of humor okay then yes uh okay so um don't do drugs kids
6717926	6721907	So anyway, of course I meant smoking a hookah, which is perfectly legal.
6723467	6724148	Smoking meat.
6724488	6724768	Yes.
6725908	6727628	Or a water.
6727708	6727969	Let's see.
6727989	6728729	Smoking water.
6728809	6729729	Like a water bong.
6729749	6730269	That's what I meant.
6731249	6737411	Anyhow, so as that name would talk about, the heroes will be transported inside your favorite games.
6738231	6741072	That's pretty much what you'd expect in an episode of a regular show anyway.
6741132	6743272	So it's 8-bit land for the 3DS.
6743832	6746313	I guess they already have a game on iOS, which most...
6747398	6749881	I kind of assume that everything has a game on IS.
6750702	6751143	There you go.
6751303	6753005	Actdeft says, I like the show.
6753126	6755028	Lots and lots of 80s references.
6756189	6760034	QueenSimi on our chatroom says, regular show is more of a stoner hipster show.
6760175	6761056	Just like I thought.
6761176	6761396	Huh?
6761516	6761717	Huh?
6761737	6762698	There you go.
6763530	6763950	DarkSakura
6781581	6782442	You have to guess what it is.
6782502	6782982	I'm just kidding.
6783803	6790248	Disney has registered some domains that means that they might be doing some type of racing game.
6791108	6798454	There's Disney Speedster, Disney Speedsters, Disney Racers, Disney Racing, Disney Kart, Disney Kart Racing, and Disney Karting.
6801529	6805312	They actually have a Disney Speedsters Twitter with no tweets on it yet.
6806133	6809455	So, not surprising, Disney has their fingers in most things.
6810295	6813938	Also, there is Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventure.
6815679	6820523	This is basically, it makes me think a lot of Pac-Land.
6821604	6822044	Do you remember?
6823503	6833976	But like on a 3D scale and it's basically Pac-Man wandering around in a 3D world It looks neat It's also based off a new TV show What?
6834357	6835558	Yep What?
6836680	6839203	Now I need to go back and watch 80s Pac-Man cartoons
6841710	6857460	And then, last but not least, Google did a tribute to Atari's Breakout by having, if you type in Atari Breakout into the Google Images search, you will find your screen turned into a Breakout clone.
6859841	6861842	Another little Google Easter egg.
6862523	6862763	Yep.
6863483	6867966	I actually, I super, super loved what Google did for Saw Bass's birthday.
6868616	6869136	I saw that.
6869756	6878239	I was like, I just kept watching it over and over again and then I had to watch It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World because that man is like my hero.
6878979	6879660	I'm sad he's dead.
6880660	6881800	Can you still play the Pac-Man?
6881880	6884181	I remember the Pac-Man thing they did was legendary.
6884221	6885142	Can you still play that?
6885422	6886242	I can find out.
6886302	6889023	Didn't they leave that up on the internet somewhere where you can still play that?
6890363	6890603	Yes.
6891524	6891804	Really?
6893484	6893684	Yep.
6893884	6895445	In fact, I will put the link into the chat room.
6896144	6897785	Let's get to the Foogle question of the week.
6919349	6922912	Take Facebook and Google and slam them together, you get Foogle.
6923012	6928996	And every week we ask a question in our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities and read some of our favorite answers.
6929156	6933760	And I am going to have to limit how much I read tonight, guys, because there's just so many long answers.
6934620	6936982	And so I do want the show to be over in a reasonable amount of time tonight.
6937322	6939624	So I apologize in advance if I don't read yours.
6939704	6942166	But I will start on Google Plus tonight.
6942566	6944568	And I'm going to read this from Travis H.,
6945488	6952576	with the majority of the gaming world hating on their new console and a lead developer from EA coming out last week calling the system crap.
6952696	6954317	Oh, I didn't even read the damn question, did I?
6954337	6954658	I'm sorry.
6954958	6961665	Well, I said it was going to be about the Nintendo Let's Play thing, but let me read to you what I said for the communities.
6962305	6964447	What are your thoughts on Let's Play videos?
6964547	6965668	Do you like to watch them?
6965848	6967229	Are you someone that creates them?
6967690	6970252	Lastly, how do you feel about the news story itself?
6970572	6977098	Has it soured your opinion on Nintendo or do you think they were well within their rights to make money off their game images?
6977118	6980340	And I link to the story that Loki talked about earlier in the show.
6981121	6985123	Alright, so now going back to Travis H's answer over on Google+.
6985663	6995909	With the majority of the gaming world hating on their new console and a lead developer from EA coming out last week calling the system crap, I feel like the big N needs all the help and gamer love they can get.
6996369	6998150	I own a Wii U and a 3DS.
6998310	7000690	In my opinion, Nintendo is failing miserably.
7001130	7007352	They need to focus more on making some damn games for the Wii U and stop bitching about free advertisement and promotion of their games.
7007892	7016035	As for the content and spoiler aspect of the videos, if you don't want the game content spoiled for yourself, here is a novel idea.
7016435	7017115	Don't watch.
7017655	7019276	Hashtag wake up Nintendo.
7020616	7024318	and that is a very similar thing that I've read on many places on the internet this week.
7025478	7026879	Do you feel the same way about Microsoft?
7027079	7027779	Just making sure.
7027959	7028600	I'm assuming you do.
7029760	7031361	Reading some of the other answers here.
7031581	7038084	I'm going to go to Facebook and I'm purposely being a little picky choosy from names I don't see all like in chat and in mailbag and other places.
7038804	7041406	But I do encourage everybody to go read all of the answers.
7041466	7043168	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
7043468	7044149	I'll read this one.
7044229	7046350	Vince from AKVG Games.
7047051	7049613	I'm a person that loves making and watching Let's Plays.
7049773	7051494	Somebody that actually does Let's Play videos.
7052075	7054417	I neither disagree or agree with Nintendo.
7054757	7059661	Yes, LPs can be a gain or take on sales depending on how a certain game of theirs is handled.
7059941	7062203	B. So does reviews and articles.
7063023	7075612	This was typed via mobile so I'm thinking autocorrect really fucked with that sentence there but I think it's depending on how a certain game of theirs is handled but so do reviews and articles.
7076252	7080895	It's a tough topic really because we don't really know if Nintendo is right or wrong with making this decision.
7081375	7086799	I guess for now if you want to make a living off Nintendo long plays you'll have to contact Nintendo and work something out with them.
7087299	7091424	At least you're still able to do them and not disappear from the internet like other companies do.
7091644	7092405	Dot, dot, dot.
7092765	7093246	Sega.
7095708	7097971	Chiggers asks, what's a Let's Play video?
7098071	7099032	Was that tongue-in-cheek?
7099152	7099592	I'm not sure.
7100772	7101453	Going to Zether.
7101933	7102474	Zether says,
7125091	7132216	and they were fun to watch as opposed to most of the YouTube partners who do game long plays for the cash like PewDiePie.
7133097	7137380	Even people like Chugga Conroy who play Nintendo games are not in it for the money.
7137741	7141984	Nintendo is doing the right thing and frankly these people deserve what's coming to them.
7142524	7144286	That's a pretty pointed answer.
7145286	7161708	um let's see um Andy R says I don't watch let's plays myself but the news did solely my opinion of Nintendo a bit at least among the couple of people I know who do their own let's plays they're not trying to profit off the content they just want to provide entertainment and to share something they love with others
7162629	7169375	Benjamin H actually replied to that and said, Andy, those LPs can still provide entertainment and share something they love.
7169695	7176862	If they're not trying to profit from the Nintendo-based content, are they really going to be majorly affected by Nintendo trying to profit from it?
7178560	7181702	Under Leveled Video replies and says, I do Let's Plays.
7182302	7186465	I only monetize the videos that the publisher of the game has said it's okay to monetize.
7186805	7188406	Blizzard, Minecraft, etc.
7188826	7191668	They don't care because they see it as free advertising for them.
7192068	7199732	Several indie game developers have gone on record to say if it hadn't been for people playing their game on YouTube, they never would have sold as many copies as they did.
7200193	7205696	In an ideal world, I think the ad revenue generated should be split between the game developer and the YouTuber, but
7205876	7208999	But perfect worlds are impossible in this money-grubbing existence.
7209620	7211381	Interesting, because I suggested the same thing earlier.
7211862	7224734	Once again, I'm just confused that the amount of money that they're generating per each video is so... It's so small that you really think that...
7225715	7227016	I don't know, it just seems kind of odd.
7227276	7237301	I understand it's your property or whatever, and you're mad at people making money off of it because they like your property and they want to show people stuff.
7237641	7242683	I mean, it's not like they're putting out a DVD or something with your game on it and saying, oh, this is my game.
7243403	7245244	It's just, I don't know.
7245264	7250487	All right, let me finish the comment here from Underleveled Video because I think the end of it is very interesting.
7251147	7254189	It really is a gray area, though, in copyright and fair use.
7254569	7260573	Nintendo owns the game, but the YouTuber owns their actions in said game as well as their commentary on top of the video.
7261213	7264015	I think a court case needs to happen to make legal precedent.
7264816	7268258	That's a scary thought, but... Is it really going to come to that?
7268738	7269118	It might.
7270619	7288816	uh not in Nintendo's case but maybe another company it could be something like you know where they use that fair was the content ID system and they overreach their bounds and like ban an account that's made a lot of money on something they've done that was Angry Game Nerd or whatever got his channel taken down one time and
7288976	7294697	Well, to be fair, again, I just want to be clear, Nintendo is not doing the strike thing against the people.
7295317	7306100	They were very clear, and they tried to make themselves look like the good guys in the comments saying, hey, we didn't do what certain other entertainment companies are doing, and we're just switching the monetization thing, basically.
7306140	7310101	We're not actually doing copyright strikes that will get your channel taken down.
7310541	7316505	But in the eyes of people who are thinking they're being the big asshole, being less of an asshole doesn't make you not an asshole.
7316605	7317366	Yeah, exactly.
7317486	7330875	I mean, I understand that they're doing the thing or whatever, that they're not taking down videos, but at the same time, they could also be like Minecraft and Blizzard and say, hey, it's cool that you guys show videos of our games.
7331375	7337459	So, yes, I understand that they can take down games, but the fact that they're taking all the ad revenue from it is still kind of a dick move.
7338908	7341130	Alright, I want to read one more here.
7341290	7342691	I think this is a very interesting response.
7342771	7350155	It's kind of, you know, we've heard a lot of people that are very supportive of what Nintendo's doing and this one is kind of going the other direction that supports the Let's Players a little more.
7350175	7350696	So let me read this.
7351036	7354899	It's from Jeff B. A Let's Play video is one's own content.
7355039	7357881	That person's style of play and their commentary make it their own.
7358221	7360222	It is not the same as just posting a trailer.
7360502	7364285	Nintendo makes the sandbox, we play in it, or choose not to as we're seeing now.
7364785	7390312	relatively few YouTube creators make a sole living just off that content most of the time the best they get for doing that work and make no mistake a quality LP is work is a part-time jobs pay or enough for one nice dinner out a month honestly it doesn't even really matter whether Nintendo was legally or morally justified because it was bad business no matter how you slice it and I imagine this problem for Nintendo will diminish quickly as they continue to copyright claim people's LP videos
7390772	7398838	When Nintendo started this, they had to have known it'd stop Let's Play videos of their own games getting made by a good chunk of the people putting out quality game content on YouTube.
7399198	7406164	That's free advertising that Nintendo's own, most loyal community does that gets more of their games sold.
7406504	7413449	If Nintendo wants to nickel and dime, literally nickel and dime in some cases, some of their best community ambassadors, they can go right ahead.
7413789	7418133	I'm sure they're legally clear to do that, but maybe they should think twice about turning on their own fans.
7418573	7444810	I welcome them to come over to Twitch and try the same advertising revenue claim and honestly I'm starting to hope Twitch caves it means no partners will be streaming newer Nintendo games more room for League of Legends streams just kidding I hate League of Legends someday Nintendo will realize that giving people access to your game in nearly any way you can not taking it away brings in sales and by doing this on YouTube they are indirectly taking access away because the community will stop showcasing their games
7446031	7449377	So, very much saying that these guys are doing you a favor.
7449437	7452282	Nintendo, you are... I'm kind of summarizing in my own words.
7452322	7455488	Nintendo, you are going to lose a lot of support on this.
7456181	7461405	I found the tangent on Twitch interesting though.
7461425	7464808	I'm not sure what the point... I have to be honest.
7464828	7466609	I'm not sure what the point was you were trying to make with that.
7467170	7471773	Because does that mean you want Nintendo to go over to Twitch and you want Twitch to cave on that?
7472574	7473014	Oh, I see.
7473074	7476517	Because then no more newer Nintendo games on Twitch.
7477037	7477257	But...
7478498	7481580	Why would you want that to happen if you hate League of Legends?
7481660	7489686	I think it's just saying, you know, it'd show them, like, you know, even if they get rid of, you know, YouTube videos of Nintendo games.
7489926	7491247	And how old are we going here?
7491287	7497471	Are we talking about, like, if I have a NES Super Mario Let's Play or something like that, they're going to monetize that?
7497791	7507037	Because that right there, they're trying to sell virtual console games, and people don't know what the hell this game is, and they look up a Let's Play video for it, and they're like, hey, that looks kind of cool, I'm going to buy that game.
7508660	7514382	They don't have demos for those games, even though they really should find a way to do that.
7514502	7519844	Hello, we're 2013 and you can't fucking figure out how to make a demo for a game?
7520104	7524186	Why aren't you getting people to your website where the YouTube is posted to make money off your website?
7526263	7530806	I'm not... There's something I'm not... Because it's automatic.
7530866	7531746	It's automatic.
7531826	7534068	Because ad revenue is automatic.
7534528	7537470	That's just like, you know, why put ads on your website?
7537990	7538771	It's the same thing.
7539611	7555140	What if I have Nintendo content on my website and I'm making ad revenue through those same... Literally, it's the same ads that you're getting through... It's all the Google Analytics stuff, so... It's kind of a workaround, I guess, but...
7556321	7572411	I don't know I honestly think that the money part of it is a smaller factor than them trying to control content because I mean think about it you've got basically unsolicited advertising coming up yeah but it may not be exactly what Nintendo wants to see out there
7572847	7574368	Maybe that is a workaround.
7574448	7576590	You make a private video.
7577131	7579392	In fact, hey, someone could even get on this bandwagon.
7579793	7590402	They have some sort of service where it creates a webpage for you that you go to to watch this video, almost like a URL redirector or shortener or something like that.
7590842	7596647	And look, there's ad content on there through Google Analytics, but you're still making money, but you just don't have an advertisement on the video.
7596707	7597147	There you go.
7598208	7598729	People love loopholes.
7598769	7599250	Companies don't.
7610771	7629937	there's some of the answers again because a lot of these were lengthy and I only have a little bit of time I did not want to read all of them but I encourage you guys to go read them for yourselves facebook.com slash orange lounge radio also google plus there was another answer over there at search for orange launch radio on google plus I would give you all the numbers but you'd forget
7631308	7631628	E.A.
7632009	7633270	has no games for the Wii U.
7655049	7675807	and I think a lot of that has to do with that they're pushing to do the Frostbite 3 engine for a lot of their games including I think sports games and Frostbite 3 does not work on the Wii U or basically they just don't want to make it work on the Wii U because they are developing a new Frostbite engine for mobile so
7676568	7681491	In theory, they could create a Frostbite 2.5 or something like that that runs on Wii U and just have to port it over.
7681531	7686213	But it's just not worth it to them to do that because they're not making any money off of it.
7686353	7691616	For example, FIFA 14 is not coming to the Wii U because FIFA 13 sales were not very good.
7691896	7698219	Although that's not a really good comparison because FIFA 13 was just FIFA 12 but re-skinned with a roster update.
7698519	7701461	Literally, that's what it was on the Wii U. So...
7703928	7730980	whatever but that's the case I think with a lot of these companies they're not porting their games to the Wii U because it's just not making any sense and one of these games that was a big part of E3 their presentation was Ghost Recon Online still on hold even though it was supposed to be coming out when is it coming out we haven't heard anything since like a year ago I don't know let me ask a question here is EA still making games for the Playstation Vita
7732341	7733261	and DarkSakura.
7752073	7756775	I don't think it's necessarily like EA has it out for Nintendo or whatever.
7757436	7765620	I've also heard the theory about maybe a botched relationship with Origin on Nintendo or whatever, which actually might be part of it.
7765680	7771943	But I think it's more in general an inability on Nintendo's part to grasp online.
7772643	7780830	And I think, for one, the online pass system couldn't be implemented on the Nintendo, which was a problem, I think, for EA in some regards.
7780850	7782611	Because you don't see it in Mass Effect, do you?
7782692	7783592	In the Mass Effect game.
7784013	7788436	Well, you don't see it in Mass Effect, but is it on Assassin's Creed 3?
7788657	7790118	Because wouldn't that have Uplay on it?
7791599	7794421	Uplay is on Wii U because it's in Zombie U. Well, that's similar.
7795382	7800624	Okay, but there's a whole little separate Uplay channel that you can download and all this stuff on the Wii U as well.
7800644	7801544	Why can't there be an Origin channel?
7801684	7802145	Why not?
7802465	7814569	But what I think is, I think there's something about the online store and its inability to do what EA wants when it comes to a lot of the DLC, when it comes to the online passes.
7814629	7815249	I mean, think about it.
7815650	7818991	None of the Mass Effect 3 DLC ever came to Nintendo.
7819451	7819931	None of it.
7820211	7822032	Not the free stuff or the pay stuff.
7822532	7828795	Only the stuff that they were able to put on the disc, like the extended cut.
7830215	7835097	Now that I think of it too, did any of the DLC come out for Black Ops 2 on the Wii U?
7835277	7836318	I'm not sure it did.
7837634	7864549	so there's something weird there and to me that's the problem and I don't think it's I don't really buy the whole they can't do it I think there's not as much money to be made not because there's a lower adoption of Wii U's or whatever because if they're still making games for the Vita then that's not the only problem but the Vita, it's very easy to incorporate it works just like the Playstation 3 with all the DLC
7865209	7888103	so I think there's something I think there's something with that is the real reason why EA is not continuing to put games out there because it doesn't match their vision of of being able to nickel and dime you online and possibly whatever is coming after this online pass maybe Wii U can't do hmm think I might be onto something maybe yeah yeah maybe um
7890197	7890998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7908832	7909212	I don't know.
7909292	7910592	I don't really know what the sales numbers are.
7910752	7913133	Because it is something that's worldwide.
7913373	7918454	FIFA is a really big game worldwide, so maybe that happened.
7918754	7927456	Or maybe they're just going to take the easy way out and just take the game from last year and once again just update the roster and just release a really half-assed game.
7927476	7927797	That's true.
7927837	7928157	They might.
7930757	7934038	I guess they could have done that with the Wii U, but I don't know.
7935754	7936955	Just release the Wii version?
7937395	7938436	Well, no, the Wii U version.
7938456	7939717	Just release it again.
7939737	7941818	Just get it and update the rosters.
7942839	7943720	Very interesting.
7945761	7946942	Was that in your little blog?
7946982	7947222	Oh, yeah.
7947323	7947723	There you go.
7948323	7951766	So, let's move on to some news out of Google this week.
7951946	7954148	Google had their whole little... What was it called?
7954168	7955929	The IO conference or something like that?
7956449	7959050	and they announced some changes coming to Google Maps.
7959170	7964133	They talked about some of the Hangouts and Google+.
7964193	7971276	They talked a lot about one of the things they talked about on Google+, is that there will no longer be Google Plus games after June 30th.
7971316	7975919	In fact, if you actually go to Google Plus games right now, they say they are no longer going to be available after June 30th.
7976459	7976779	GameServices.com
7993261	8001184	It's part of Google Play, a game service that's going to launch out of the Play Store that will link together mobile, social, and cloud gaming.
8001204	8007707	And I seem to remember they were showing a demo that showed one guy playing on the web, one playing on a phone, and one on a tablet or something.
8008067	8009147	They're all linked together.
8009527	8016970	So I'm assuming Google Plus games, I mean, let's be real, they probably were not that popular in the first place because Google Plus did not catch on the way Facebook did.
8017471	8018151	It's popular.
8018211	8020772	It's cultish, but it's not mainstream, right?
8020812	8020992	Yeah.
8021332	8024473	So the games aren't catching on, so now you've got this instead.
8025954	8035158	They're saying it's going to be different from Apple and what they do with Game Center because there will be back-end support, and this is not going to be just a standalone application.
8035738	8039720	Anyone making a game with Google Play has access to the developer services.
8040380	8045843	Some games will have this incorporated already, like World of Goo, Kingdom Rush, Beach Buggy, Blitz...
8046763	8075514	Osmos and so forth it's not mandatory there's no certification process interesting and it's cross platform which is wonderful they showed on one of the demos it was like a tech demo this racing game where they had all these different tablets and phones and stuff next to each other and it created a racetrack like a slot car racing thing but it was cross platform cross device and it all worked flawlessly
8076181	8083283	Yeah, so my thought is that they'll probably incorporate this at some point into Google+, where it's like play the game on the web or something like that.
8083823	8092145	It's just kind of an evolution of that, which sounds a lot cooler than Facebook games.
8092245	8094085	Anything sounds better than Facebook games.
8094185	8099787	If I get one more fucking invite for Candy Crush Saga, I'm going to cut somebody.
8100487	8103831	Being stabbed in the eye is better than... Not really.
8104511	8106674	Slightly better than Facebook games.
8107454	8108756	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
8109611	8110672	I got some stuff.
8110852	8112112	How about Nintendo stuff?
8113113	8117455	Basically, Nintendo won an appeal to keep selling the Wii in the US.
8119056	8125419	Basically, there was the whole litigation about Motiva, is that how it's pronounced?
8125979	8131482	Saying that the Wii had infringed on two of its patents to track body position and body movement.
8132302	8138866	But the judges agreed that their motive was just to win damages or a settlement, not for licensing.
8139546	8143968	So they said no, and Nintendo won.
8146389	8154073	So Nintendo can keep selling the Wii, even though they should be trying to get that thing off shelves and try to make people buy Wii U instead, right?
8154814	8155114	No.
8155734	8158636	I think they should just give up on the Wii U and actually put out a system.
8161580	8162441	I think it's too early.
8163121	8166623	I don't understand why everybody's like, Wii U's dead and it's only been nine months.
8167524	8169084	Again, 3DS, same thing.
8169585	8175048	If we're sitting here after the holidays still saying the same story, then we can call the Wii U dead.
8175088	8176168	But I'm not ready to say that yet.
8177689	8185514	I mean, I'm not saying it's dead, but it really is highly underperforming for a Nintendo system.
8186826	8192290	I mean, you remember how hyper everyone was about the Wii, and then the Wii U comes out, and I'm still finding them no problem.
8192771	8193971	Like, piles of them.
8194032	8197094	The 3DS was a Nintendo system, and it was the same story.
8197434	8200016	It sold better than the Wii U. Did it?
8200456	8201057	I think it did.
8201357	8205500	I think it, yeah, it's selling better than the, well, it's definitely selling better than the Wii U right now.
8205640	8210264	Well, okay, but the price to get one was also half as much.
8211862	8212422	Yeah.
8212662	8213903	Less than a Wii U, for sure.
8215805	8217186	Well, it's $250.
8219088	8221090	Well, and think about it this way, too.
8221190	8227155	You know, having a home console is a lot more, I think, of a commitment than having a handheld system.
8228149	8233091	And with a handheld system, you have the advantage of it being just that, something you can carry around with you.
8233271	8236172	But I think with the 3DS, too, I mean, look at it this way.
8236312	8238733	They had a gimmick that was interesting.
8238913	8242995	It was a 3D display without any 3D glasses.
8243255	8245656	And that was like, whoa, that's a neat thing.
8245936	8249297	Versus the Wii U with, A, it's a tablet controller.
8249897	8261869	People are used to playing with tablets, so it wasn't that big of a new thing, but 3D graphics without glasses, that was like, holy crap, even if no one uses it anymore.
8262549	8264411	Well, there's phones that do the same thing now.
8264471	8266333	Dan's old Galaxy did.
8268604	8268884	I don't know.
8269124	8270344	The lenticular screen?
8270684	8274265	I'm just not still willing to say it's dead at this point.
8274785	8283567	But I will say I think one big mistake they made is that they made that touchpad was really a step back to where touch gaming is at right now.
8283887	8285288	Like the whole having to use a stylus.
8285308	8291249	I mean, I guess you don't have to for some games, but it really should have been as good of a touch as modern tablets and so forth.
8291289	8296890	Because, yeah, people do know a tablet and they expect it to respond a lot better to touch than Nintendo's tablet does.
8297797	8302161	For the record, Dan said that his phone that had the lenticular screen was the thrill.
8303522	8304803	So it wasn't his Galaxy.
8305703	8306724	It was still kind of neat, though.
8306784	8308566	It gave me the same type of headache the 3DS does.
8310006	8319655	So are we going to have them release a Wii U with Tablet Plus that's going to have multi-touch on it and it's going to be an upgrade of what they do with Wii Remote Plus?
8319915	8320516	I hope not.
8321397	8328443	I still would like to see some more games for the system I have, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's a place we end up next year.
8329204	8353262	but I think this year is all about this is not a year to release any hardware maybe that whole Wii Fit thing which I'm sure is one of the games they're going to be pushing for the holidays that is a little bit different because that's an add-on with a very specific purpose but this is not the year to be pushing hardware for the Wii U or anything in the living room it will really alienate the people that have supported the system
8355106	8356007	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8372182	8373062	You know, OUYA.
8374603	8376583	I was joking about this on Bobby's show.
8376804	8379104	OUYA is going to be at E3.
8379204	8382365	Well, at E3 in proximity to E3.
8382385	8385587	They're going to be in a parking lot outside of E3 in a van.
8386647	8387207	Down by the river?
8387747	8389068	By the river, yeah.
8389168	8396570	No, actually, they're going to be in the parking lot and they're going to be... They basically said, everything you need to put on a killer game demo.
8396870	8398291	OUYA console, controllers, and TV.
8401577	8403500	That's not how you put on a killer game demo.
8403561	8408070	I mean, because... Granted, there are a lot of games... I mean, there's games on the Ouya, but...
8411296	8415460	Not all of them were like, hey, buy me because this game is on there.
8416221	8418483	Although they could show that parking game with no brake.
8418503	8420105	Parking game is awesome.
8420185	8421426	Here's what I want to know.
8421486	8423108	I want to know how they're going to fix my controller.
8423188	8425510	Because my controller is all fucked up.
8426130	8431395	And apparently the newer consoles that are shipping now have a fixed controller.
8431475	8433758	So where do I RMA that bitch?
8433818	8434318	Because...
8435379	8435859	Thanks for watching!
8447079	8447640	Thanks for watching!
8467664	8479815	This is likely the same lot that Saints Row the Third used last year, which is across the street from Staples Center, which got even more exposure because, hey, it was right during the time when the Lakers were in the playoffs last year when E3 was going on.
8480215	8481397	Or was it last year or two years ago?
8481417	8481997	No, it was last year.
8482398	8484780	So even extra exposure, right?
8484960	8485140	Yeah.
8485160	8485300	Yeah.
8487941	8499906	Anyhow, well, Konami talking E3 or at least a pre-E3 show and they've been doing this kind of, they've been doing like the Nintendo Direct thing for a little while too.
8499966	8501486	They do these videos that go out.
8502327	8509329	So Konami will be doing a pre-E3 show that will give the latest on some of their franchises on June 6th.
8509749	8511510	This is the third year that they've done it.
8512070	8515872	Notice how, I think the last time they did it was when Rock Revolution came out.
8516912	8518494	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8534869	8539733	New trailers for Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2, which was also seen last year.
8541154	8542375	A year before last, I think.
8542415	8546978	But also, Metal Gear Solid 5, which I'm sure some people are very excited about.
8547018	8548099	The Phantom Pain.
8548480	8549680	Snake is even older.
8549901	8551982	Yes, that will be there as well.
8552122	8555345	And I'm sure there will be some other unannounced goodies, too.
8555825	8558747	And I know we have some longtime Bomani fans who still listen to the show.
8559448	8563731	I would not go in anticipating anything as far as the beat games go, but...
8564031	8567732	You never know if the new Xbox has this Kinect thing built in.
8568392	8573833	Maybe they'll try the Rhythm Party thing again or Dance Masters.
8575294	8576734	I don't think Dance Masters did very well.
8577034	8579455	But Rhythm Party was just on sale over the weekend.
8579475	8580455	It might still be, actually.
8580495	8584476	If you don't have Rhythm Party and you like Bomani games and you have a Kinect, Rhythm Party's...
8585336	8585796	Not bad.
8586296	8588617	The problem is there's only like five songs in the base game.
8588657	8589457	It's all DLC.
8589937	8591998	But it's a pretty well put together game.
8592018	8595219	They should have just made it a disc game with a well-rounded 50 songs.
8595239	8595939	It would have been awesome.
8596599	8598199	But anyway, so I don't know.
8599080	8601540	I wouldn't hold my breath as far as music games go, though.
8601560	8603501	I don't think you're going to see Beat Mania 2DX or anything.
8603521	8603981	I don't know.
8604041	8605081	Just call it a hunch.
8605101	8607802	I think a lot of that stuff is long gone.
8608202	8610423	I don't know what the heck they would be putting up then because...
8611323	8611463	Pro Evo
8627267	8630288	Alright, let's go on to the mailbag.
8630628	8641713	Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives into the email bag head first and tries not to catch anything as she's pulling out your emails to read here on the show.
8642953	8646334	DarkSakura, why don't you read some emails for us?
8646955	8648795	Okay, we have three.
8649696	8650536	Three whole emails.
8651585	8676672	um, the first one dear OLR, a very belated congratulations on your achievement of reaching 500 plus episodes excuse me thanks for being there with me on so many long drives to work and back I wish that I could join you on live shows more often but family commitments usually conflict with that I have been listening to you since before my son was even born six years ago who is now old enough to game with me thank you for making me feel old
8677655	8678095	Right?
8678835	8679335	Seriously.
8679976	8691258	With the new Next Box being announced this week, I continue to be very excited about gaming even though I miss the days of the arcade or days gone by of trying to finish games we rented from the local video store.
8691858	8698800	Sometimes I feel that gamers today are very jaded considering there is a gamut of options out there on every imaginable platform.
8699520	8701981	The constant complaints can often be disheartening.
8702561	8703521	I agree with that.
8704440	8704560	And, um...
8726186	8728989	Well, I'll go ahead and read it because it's kind of long.
8729770	8731652	It's up to you if you want to read the rest of this on air or not.
8731672	8737398	I'm hoping DarkSakura, since she is unemployed or someone OLR, can use this license either for the show or even just to enjoy.
8737439	8739761	You're welcome to keep it or give it away as you please.
8739921	8740682	Oh my god.
8742584	8744687	A one year subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud.
8746141	8752525	Yeah, I saw that in the email bag earlier this week, and I was like, oh boy, DarkSakura's going to be pretty excited about that.
8753006	8755007	I need new underwear, please.
8755187	8758149	If she doesn't want it, then I would like to get the new audition.
8758209	8762332	That would be great for podcasts.
8763533	8768496	But a very, very generous donation, and...
8769677	8783545	I'm always amazed by the generosity of our listeners just in being here and participating and even when there's free stuff like this to come out of it and a lot of that stuff will go right back into helping the show and VOG.
8783965	8790049	Well, given that I'm doing all of the graphics for the site and everything, yeah, I think I have a use for this.
8791405	8793249	So, yeah, very cool.
8793390	8795454	Excuse me, I'm actually tearing up a little bit now.
8795675	8796136	Are you really?
8796677	8797158	Just a little bit.
8797178	8797859	Can you cry on air?
8798541	8799403	No, I won't cry on air.
8799503	8801166	I cried on air when we got a gift once.
8801207	8802229	Why can't you cry on air?
8803174	8803814	You've cried on air.
8804255	8807456	I have cried on air, probably more than once, but anyhow.
8807496	8813199	I usually just cry from wank, but this is actually like, oh my god, it's super, super awesome.
8813680	8815601	So, again, thank you.
8815861	8816861	It's amazing.
8816901	8817722	You really didn't have to.
8817842	8819403	And I know that shit ain't cheap.
8820263	8827047	Like, you might have had it in or whatever, but I really hope you did not have to pay a lot of money for that.
8827087	8827307	That's...
8828948	8832812	Isn't the current CS suite something like a good $700?
8834434	8838177	Well, I know that when I tried to get the student edition for CS6, it was like $300.
8838838	8841541	And I'm still using 5.1.
8843323	8846546	So, I'm feeling verklempt.
8847701	8850383	Talk amongst yourselves, we'll give you a topic.
8851223	8853644	Nah, I'm ready to go on.
8854344	8858506	I'm just a little floored right now, and probably sinus medicine has something to do with that too.
8860587	8869232	Dear OLR, after a two week vacation, I came back to find my Wii U gamepad was left on in TV remote controller mode the entire time plus a day.
8870172	8872114	or 360 hours straight.
8872614	8876998	It responded when I turned it off and I later started the Wii U to see if I had burn-in on the pad.
8877218	8877458	Nope!
8878819	8881181	It was plugged in the whole time or it would have turned itself off.
8881301	8884304	That's a good argument for unplugging it while playing and that's from Rababa.
8885645	8886325	Interesting.
8886386	8888207	That's a long time to leave that thing on.
8888247	8890389	I thought that thing was only supposed to work for like three hours.
8890929	8895493	But I guess maybe because the remote doesn't really use the transmitter functions.
8895833	8896734	That's crazy.
8896754	8897735	He said it was plugged in.
8899106	8899966	Oh, it's plugged in.
8900146	8900607	Oh, okay.
8901687	8902687	Yeah.
8902847	8907669	But on top of that, though, it not having any burn-in is... I'm sorry, I'm still a little floored by the other thing.
8908089	8911270	It not having burn-in is actually pretty amazing.
8912131	8916932	I remember... Now, of course, this was 19 years ago, earlier than that.
8917692	8921714	You know, having Samurai Shodown 3 and the big screen having burn-in after a week.
8922954	8927576	So, I mean... I remember the Apple IIe monitors were really susceptible to burn-in.
8927596	8928216	You had to be careful.
8928832	8933114	Oh yeah, you had that little icon in the corner like forever that was your computer icon.
8933234	8933494	Yep.
8933635	8934635	Yeah, it lived there.
8934735	8935516	It never went away.
8937116	8939498	But that's pretty impressive.
8939518	8942559	That's actually a really good sign of a quality product.
8942679	8944880	Okay, I won't rag on the Wii U that much anymore.
8945221	8945661	Yeah, I will.
8945881	8946401	Yeah, you will.
8946561	8946981	Don't lie.
8947582	8948882	Yeah, you know me.
8948902	8949343	I'm a hater.
8950043	8952804	Liars don't get codes for software.
8955549	8956772	Okay, so we have one more email.
8958295	8962765	And this person does not give us a name, so I'm just gonna say Kirk.
8967344	8968925	Good evening, my OLR peeps.
8968985	8976769	My name is Kirk, and I wanted to email you guys and say that for about six to eight months, I was taking a break from console gaming and listening to gaming podcasts.
8977169	8985133	Your show was one of my gaming podcasts I would listen to on a regular basis, and even though I couldn't make it to the live streams, I've been a loyal listener for many years.
8985353	8985854	Aw, we love you.
8986494	8995823	But this past year, I decided to be a real adult, which leads me to buying my first home, going back to school to finish my degree, and finally working on those New Year resolutions of losing weight.
8996144	8998046	Currently have lost 121 pounds.
8998066	8999207	That's like losing a supermodel.
8999627	9000388	That's crazy.
9001529	9010298	I just want to say, though, with all due respect, I think that's great that you have those priorities, but I don't own a home, I don't have a degree from college, and I'm fat.
9011319	9012460	You are not that, Rob.
9012800	9014682	I still feel like an adult.
9014762	9017925	So I'm just saying, you don't have to have those things.
9017965	9020347	But I understand the point the listener was trying to make.
9021368	9022229	You are not that, Rob.
9026459	9046223	with being occupied with all those things along with a full time job gaming fell by the wayside and I've given up my PS3, Xbox 360, 3DS and listening to gaming podcasts things have settled down recently this year with me adjusting to my new townhouse except for the noisy neighbors and keeping a regular routine with school and gym time I've gotten back into gaming
9047063	9047123	Aw.
9047143	9047183	Aw.
9067689	9072913	On My Favorite Hobbies was listening to you while listening to podcasts in the background.
9073354	9076796	And I wanted to say thank you for entertaining me for so many years.
9076876	9078598	And I'm glad to be back as a loyal listener.
9078998	9080979	Well, we are glad to have you back.
9081099	9084062	This fat homeless dropout is so happy to have you here.
9085903	9086864	I had to, sorry.
9087605	9088566	You know what?
9089407	9090327	I get the real point.
9091148	9098095	Sometimes in order to make change happen in your life, you have to change some things.
9098415	9100477	So I get the point.
9101057	9107843	If you have one thing that is becoming so distracting to the point that you can't get anything else done...
9108544	9109766	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9129980	9131681	People who drink, you know?
9132421	9137523	You either can cut it out a little bit and you're fine or you have to cold turkey it and not drink at all.
9138763	9139283	Or smoking.
9139303	9145125	To be able to get to your other priorities and stop something that's getting in the way of a productive life.
9145485	9150347	Or smoking, Jamie, because some people can do it cold turkey or some people have to do it cold turkey.
9150647	9154989	Some people need the patch or a support group or, you know.
9155549	9157610	Or you're my uncle and you smoke the electric cigarettes.
9158130	9158270	Yeah.
9160029	9161751	I will go ahead and say this.
9161811	9165316	Nicotine in and of itself is as bad for you as caffeine.
9165696	9166678	It's all the other crap in it.
9167979	9174587	So anyway, I personally take exception to the real adult thing, but I understand it.
9176250	9176530	You know.
9177378	9178018	Thanks for watching!
9203234	9203934	Yeah, same here.
9204074	9205375	I mean, I'd like to have a job.
9206475	9207295	Not for lack of trying.
9207916	9208116	Right.
9208256	9219480	But at the same time, you know, I think that you could, and I've had to explain this to my mother, and I always give her a hard time because I was like, how much of my Nintendo did you play when I was 12?
9221659	9224000	You can be into gaming.
9224040	9233123	You can be into people years older than me who are still majorly into every new anime that ever comes out.
9233683	9239725	I'm not as much as I used to be even though something comes out that I might like or I like watching the old stuff.
9240105	9241446	Everyone's got their thing.
9241686	9247548	There's nothing wrong with enjoying something and having fun as long as you don't do it to the exception of all else.
9247828	9248008	Right.
9250150	9275889	And I think that's the real point, yes Exactly, and yeah, I'm not going to go off anymore about that But I do have to say congratulations to you, Kirk, for your fantastic achievements I mean, you lost a person That's amazing Dan lost that much Yeah, Extifer from Horde House lost a whole heck of a lot as well And I know that took a lot of work, and it's very impressive
9276508	9280531	Also, thank you, Fifth Dream, for not making me feel like I'm the oldest person in chat.
9282312	9282652	Hearts.
9283092	9283633	That's it, Rob.
9284073	9284893	That's it for the emails.
9284933	9293739	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Before we get back into some gaming news, it's time for us to get a little ranty with a segment we call the F-Years of the Week.
9310578	9317543	I guess the only F you that I have is to this cold that I got from Dan.
9319344	9326289	But other than that, I'm looking at the Adobe site with tears in my eyes.
9326449	9327110	I'm so happy.
9329031	9331773	I'm seriously like shaking with joy.
9334315	9338658	It's like Panto knocked on my door and said we want you to design everything in the world for us.
9339417	9341358	Well, that ruins the angsty segment.
9343239	9347301	F you to that emailer for the generous gift for screwing up the FUs.
9347341	9348182	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
9348942	9349242	Alright.
9350483	9360868	Oh, and F you to everyone putting spoilers out about Star Trek Into Darkness because I haven't seen it yet and I'm not reading any reviews because they've all been spoilery.
9363009	9363309	Alright.
9363790	9364010	Loki.
9366406	9371189	Uh, to UEF for their controllers being all sorts of broken.
9371670	9372490	Just the analogs.
9372730	9373471	It's really annoying.
9373851	9378355	It can be fixed with a software patch, but it's not really fixed.
9378415	9380976	It's just kind of a workaround, I guess.
9381917	9385139	It still sucks, though, because I'm trying to play some of these games and it's just like, ugh.
9387501	9389022	That's it.
9389403	9393146	My FU of the week goes to... I don't know.
9393306	9396849	Things are fairly well, so I don't have a lot of angst.
9397049	9401713	FU to traffic on the way to the Bay Area, because it took me three hours to make a drive that should take an hour and 45 minutes.
9404275	9427066	and FU to the Kabuki Theater in San Francisco although actually it's kind of like the good kind of FU because like I loved seeing that movie there so much because it was in a theater that served booze and they only let 21 and up people in there so no babies and the reason why I say FU is now I want to see every movie at that theater in San Francisco and that's not possible
9429784	9433965	My movie-going experience bar has been forever changed because of that.
9434585	9435706	The bar has been raised.
9435726	9436286	That's right.
9436486	9437306	The bar has been raised.
9437786	9438086	All right.
9438626	9444328	Just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we will get to Twitter topics and our Skype line here eventually.
9445368	9446608	So let's get to Loki.
9447489	9456851	So there was an announcement a few months ago about Batman Arkham Origins, and it was revealed that
9457051	9461334	Hey, Batman's not going to be voiced by Kevin Conroy anymore.
9461354	9462755	It's going to be a new person.
9463335	9464676	And there was much bitching.
9464996	9474022	Well, thankfully now, the deal has been put in place where, yes, Kevin Conroy will be Batman because he is Batman.
9474463	9480707	And he will be returning as the voice of Batman in the new game when it comes out in October.
9481447	9490750	Also revealed, thanks to an Amazon pre-order, there apparently will be DLC where Deathstroke will be playable in some form.
9490910	9493971	Probably like the Challenge missions and the other games.
9494151	9496032	But, uh, neat.
9498032	9498593	Glad that they have it.
9498613	9499573	That'll make a lot of people happy.
9499932	9501852	Yeah, I'm glad that they have the original voice coming back.
9501892	9509434	Now, is Mark Hamill actually going to be doing the voice of the Joker again in this game, or is it going to be just like... I don't think the Joker's in it.
9509534	9510594	I think that's how they got around it.
9510634	9513335	Yeah, but Mark Hamill has officially retired.
9515995	9516396	Sure he has.
9517716	9519036	No, he actually really has retired.
9519336	9520876	Apparently it was doing a number on his voice.
9524497	9527898	Well, so, yeah, Deathstroke would be kind of cool.
9529892	9532574	I don't know we'll see
9556144	9558446	Well, one more story for you guys, and I apologize.
9558506	9561928	It's political, but it is making the rounds on the gaming blogs this week.
9562589	9565371	And it's a comment from Vice President Joe Biden.
9566211	9571495	Now, you might remember that when the whole horrible, horrible thing in the school in Connecticut broke out.
9572155	9574176	Joe Biden started a task force.
9574776	9579218	He was assigned by President Obama to talk about how do you curtail gun violence and so forth.
9579738	9582459	And they did this whole thing about games and all this.
9583180	9590783	In May, the vice president met with 20 representatives from face-based organizations to talk about gun control and immigration.
9591123	9594664	He talked about video games in this as well, according to Politico.
9595565	9601407	Franklin Graham, who is the son of Billy Graham, the evangelist, I guess is what you call him,
9602367	9613611	said to the vice president that, quote, media and entertainment that portray violence should be subject to a special tax with the proceeds going to help victims and their family.
9614431	9618932	And this is according to a rabbi, Rabbi Julie Schoenfeld, who was also in that session.
9619873	9624814	Biden said, quote, there's no, quote, no restriction on the ability to do that.
9624894	9627135	There's no legal reason why they couldn't
9628815	9630916	do attacks on violent media.
9632277	9639019	Going on, the quote says, he said they really need a good scientific study, which they've done on things like smoking.
9639479	9651623	So what's interesting about this is that it's not necessarily limited to games, which I can appreciate for one, is that when they talk about attacks on violent games, then I'm like, well, what about R-rated movies and NC-17 movies?
9651703	9654704	And what about things on TV and networks and
9654924	9655945	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9677041	9679545	So, I think that's just ridiculous.
9679565	9682549	The only way I could see them ever doing that is because we need the tax dollars.
9682769	9692442	But, other than that, I mean, it's just... It's kind of ridiculous, because once again, you're just taxing things that don't necessarily have a direct correlation with violence.
9693623	9701209	And again, the problem with this, it all goes back to the root problem with that California law that we spent all this money trying to defend.
9701229	9705532	The Supreme Court overturned it because it was all up to somebody's interpretation.
9706253	9709335	And how can you tax something that has to be interpreted?
9711136	9718242	To be fair to the Vice President, even though I don't necessarily agree with what he said, he did say we would need a really good scientific study.
9718662	9719803	They would have to have facts.
9719843	9721184	We're going to need to waste more money.
9722705	9723847	Right?
9724988	9728712	But I just don't think it would be successful because what is violent?
9729292	9740605	Somebody would have to set that line and it's too what's violent to me might be not necessarily what's violent to you what's not violent to Franklin Graham or Rabbi Julie Schoenfeld
9741058	9759515	And what they're ignoring is that there actually have been scientific studies that have disproven that violent video games aren't just as likely as a movie or watching the news or reading a book.
9759716	9760997	It's the same thing.
9761718	9766222	They're as likely to cause violence as any other portrayal.
9767756	9768256	Thanks for watching!
9787494	9792361	Well, I mean, the whole rating system in and of itself is a really horrible joke.
9792401	9793523	I'm not talking about the game ratings.
9793763	9796587	The game ratings are actually better right now than the movie ratings.
9796667	9797268	They really are.
9797809	9800533	The movie ratings is in need of a serious, serious...
9801534	9802414	Reorganization.
9802474	9818281	I mean, everything from the fact that you have R-rated movies that are like Saw-level violent, then you have an R-rated movie like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion is an R-rated movie because the F-word is used more than once by Janine Garofalo's character.
9818681	9825584	And I put a movie like Romy and Michelle next to a movie like Saw and I'm like, you know, we got a problem.
9825884	9830366	Well, Janine Garofalo is just an R-rated actress, so it makes sense.
9830846	9832868	Well, didn't she also turn Scientologist?
9833388	9835430	It just makes me roll my eyes and feel very sad.
9835450	9836871	Whatever, you know what, that's her thing.
9836891	9837952	I don't care.
9838713	9842036	That's totally not the point I'm trying to make here is about the movie.
9843497	9847280	It's a joke that a movie like that, I mean, should kids see it?
9847540	9852725	Not necessarily, but I think a 14 or a 15 year old could see it.
9852945	9854066	It's no worse than there are.
9854106	9856288	It's a movie about high school for fuck's sake.
9856909	9859472	Like, it's nothing different than what they're hearing at school.
9860053	9861114	You know, it's silly.
9863590	9864010	Interesting.
9864030	9872153	Degenerate Johnny in chat at live.vognetwork.com says FCC has been quoted to state that the ESRB is the best rating system of all entertainment.
9873093	9879375	SSJ100 Matt in chat says Evil Dead, the new one, was originally rated NC-17 until they cut a few scenes out.
9879435	9879855	You know what?
9880015	9881996	I have zero interest in the new Evil Dead.
9882516	9883016	Zero.
9883337	9885917	I've heard things about the movie and I'm just like, no thanks.
9886057	9887678	It does not have the chin.
9888518	9889459	I don't care.
9890740	9891461	I don't care.
9891481	9892782	I can get you legit caught up.
9893042	9894643	No, I really don't care.
9895304	9899286	Thank you, but... I kind of want to see it, but it doesn't have Bruce, so what's the point?
9899787	9900487	He's in the cameo.
9900988	9901568	See, I know that.
9901628	9902389	I don't care.
9902649	9905131	It's not a Bruce Campbell being in the movie movie.
9905251	9906532	What kind of cameo does he have?
9907553	9908813	I don't remember.
9908873	9910334	What, does he open the door for somebody?
9910374	9910815	I don't know.
9910895	9912536	Is he a manager at S-Mart?
9912716	9914697	I don't know and I wouldn't want to spoil it.
9914777	9919060	He was a producer on the movie, so that's why.
9919140	9919760	Hey, I don't care.
9919800	9920100	You know what?
9920120	9923082	If the proceeds from this movie go to making an Army of Darkness 2...
9924503	9925024	I don't care.
9925144	9926225	It exists for a purpose.
9926345	9937880	But, you know, judge however you want to judge, but I will be there as I am every single year for the showing of Showgirls at the Castro Theater hosted by Drag Queens because I live for that shit.
9937940	9941123	Oh my god, I need to go again this year because I didn't go last year and I'm sad.
9941824	9943226	So, judge me all you want.
9943286	9945850	I won't go see Evil Dead, but I'll go see Showgirls for the 10th time in the theater.
9945870	9947171	And what's Elizabeth Berkley doing right now?
9947432	9952178	I seriously think that we should... They should kickstart a sequel to that movie.
9952258	9953720	They, okay.
9954061	9957806	Why we're talking about this on OLR, I don't know, but we're almost at the end of the show, so we can do this.
9958226	9960027	Showgirls 2, Pennies from Heaven
9986647	9987688	was the sequel.
9987728	9992231	It's on IMDb, and they actually were selling DVDs, and they screened the movie earlier in the day.
9992611	9993412	I need to see that.
9993592	9994672	Yeah, I haven't seen it.
9994772	9996093	I am not going to bother watching it.
9996474	10000396	I thought she was a great sport for going and participating.
10000696	10011403	Apparently, there's a Showgirls Off-Off Broadway production right now, and she actually is in it right now as the character she played in the movie.
10011544	10012144	I think it's great.
10014804	10018746	I just realized I won't talk about Evil Dead, but I know the In and Outs of Showgirls.
10019566	10020546	It's so bad, it's good.
10020566	10021787	Essentially the same thing.
10021807	10022867	I can't help myself.
10024628	10025808	Rob, Rob.
10027369	10031151	I don't like violence and body parts and animal violence.
10031571	10032711	I love titties.
10034892	10037393	I don't think that's such a terrible thing.
10037453	10042195	To be fair, the sex scene in the pool kind of looked like she was being attacked by a shark.
10042515	10047017	So, I mean, that's sort of similar to the violence you see in video games.
10048378	10050538	I mean, seriously, who does what she does?
10051919	10052239	All right.
10052559	10060583	Anyhow, we get to the show where it's time for... And it was like trying to get her last year because it was like the 20th anniversary or something.
10060603	10062364	They were trying to get her, but I think she was pregnant.
10063184	10063284	Oh.
10063484	10063724	Yeah.
10063944	10064524	Even better.
10065265	10067186	Can't show up.
10067366	10067926	Baby on the way.
10069180	10071162	Anyway, we're about to the end of the show.
10071222	10075085	We're going to get to last-minute stories and Twitter topics and the Skype line.
10075105	10079769	But in order to start getting the Skype calls, I've got to free up the Skype line, which means I've got to say bye to Jamie.
10081991	10082451	That's okay.
10082611	10084453	I'm lusting over the Adobe Suite right now.
10084833	10085754	Yeah, go install that.
10086875	10088676	Oh, I'm already installing seven programs right now.
10090198	10094241	Yeah, save the audition license for me because I might want to check that out.
10094441	10096583	I'm not downloading it.
10097063	10098784	Sorry you had to be here remotely.
10098985	10105469	I know we really like to have everybody here in studio, but with no show next week, that's a lot of Jamie to be missing.
10105549	10107151	So I'm glad we were able to come up with something else.
10107471	10107971	Feel better.
10108912	10110853	I actually am starting to feel a lot better.
10110893	10111994	My drugs are doing the trick.
10112675	10113896	The power of OLR.
10113936	10114916	This show heals.
10115257	10115897	Be healed.
10115957	10123163	I have to tell you that Dan warned me about him being sick in enough time and that we had shared that soda that I started taking precautions.
10123923	10126265	And so I'm not nearly as sick as I might have been.
10127039	10128039	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10150842	10151942	I actually do not.
10152142	10156803	There was one attached to the Sega thing, but it's a little bit outdated, so I'm not going to bother.
10158064	10160044	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10161084	10172487	I am going to Alabama, and if any of our listeners in or near the South with transportation would like to drive me around because I won't have a car, I'll pay for your gas.
10174301	10176863	You're hitchhiking with OLR listeners, DarkSakura?
10176903	10177824	Is that what this has come down to?
10177844	10182288	Well, you remember one of the times I went back maybe about seven years ago?
10183650	10186832	I went to Biloxi to a DDR tournament.
10188514	10189295	Oh yeah, I remember that.
10189335	10193398	Where they had the fifth mix machine and they had just gotten a fifth mix and we had had it for like ever.
10194554	10199359	So I was, you know, perfect attacking stuff and, you know, they're like, oh, what do you think of this?
10200020	10201101	Everyone was so nice.
10201301	10206087	I love meeting the arcade folks and I got to go to my old arcade.
10206207	10211472	So I'm going to try to make it by the cyber station at the former Bel Air Mall at some point.
10212213	10237090	you know I used to work there we may not be the most popular podcast on the internet but I really love it because you know what some podcasts out there they'll ask you for a hundred thousand dollars on kickstarter to meet stretch goals here at OLR we just want to bum a ride yeah I'm gonna be staying in Daphne which is an hour automobile and I kind of don't want to be in Daphne the whole time while my mom's at work oh gosh all right well good luck to you and uh Pixar didn't happen
10238241	10241022	You'll probably just get pictures of oyster shells.
10241322	10241943	It works for me.
10242343	10242583	All right.
10242623	10243483	Have a great night, Jamie.
10243503	10245104	We'll see you back in a couple weeks here on OLR.
10245544	10246284	Good night, everybody.
10246344	10246945	Hearts, hearts, hearts.
10246965	10247165	All right.
10247225	10247565	Bye-bye.
10247825	10248105	Bye.
10248825	10254047	And I'm sure she'll be in chat to say good night to the listeners and so forth and finish out our show in the chat room.
10254367	10258669	So if you want to stop on by, if you happen to be listening live, live.vognetwork.com.
10258689	10264671	But if you want to say hi to DarkSakura in the email bag, you can always do that as well, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
10266612	10274655	Let's get to the last minute stories, and I'll start to bring up the Twitter topics, and we will open up the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10275455	10276595	We're already getting calls.
10277656	10282317	The words had barely escaped my mouth, and we're already getting phone calls, so let's go to it.
10282397	10283497	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10283517	10283897	Who's this?
10284658	10285198	What up, guys?
10285258	10286458	It's Zeno from the OKC.
10286478	10286878	How you been?
10286978	10287759	Hey, ZenoCore.
10287799	10288199	I'm good.
10288239	10288779	How you doing?
10289794	10291255	You know, making music here and there.
10291695	10292276	Stuff like that.
10292596	10292876	Yeah?
10293596	10294377	I didn't know you were... Yep, yep, yep.
10294657	10297078	I didn't... Or at least I didn't remember you were a music maker.
10297118	10297619	That's awesome.
10298359	10302181	Oh, it's a recent thing I picked up over the past four or five months or so.
10302401	10302722	Oh, yeah?
10303442	10303842	Yep, yep.
10303882	10305583	Got stuff up on SoundCloud.com.
10305603	10306344	Slice Unicorn.
10306364	10308325	Check it out when you have availability.
10308725	10309505	Awesome plug.
10309585	10310326	What's on your mind tonight?
10311749	10313931	You guys are discussing the Let's Play situation.
10316052	10325118	I still think Nintendo is going a bit overboard, although I think it's a bit of an automatic attack just due to the way that their stuff is set up.
10325718	10334784	But taking the revenue, it's really just giving the guys a noogie on top of taking away their content.
10336325	10337626	I mean, that's the way I look at it.
10337666	10337906	I mean,
10338991	10339632	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10353123	10355244	Well, yeah, everybody has the luxury of doing it.
10355404	10357125	I have seen other companies do it before.
10357605	10362868	But really, I mean, they'd be better off leaving it as open advertising for their games.
10363008	10367090	I mean, because on top of that, the whole sandbox situation does apply.
10367570	10374093	I mean, the fact that they gave a product out for play, the moment somebody starts playing it, it's completely different.
10374153	10377635	Like you take Video Games Awesome Live.
10377795	10381157	Their production for what they do on top of the game is tremendous.
10381177	10381277	Yeah.
10381457	10384560	and they do it not just for games but for releases and everything else too.
10384940	10389323	If they're going to cut that off, they need to cut it off for all media that they do that with.
10390204	10393827	So nobody's allowed to do anything unless they pay Nintendo some money.
10395568	10398531	So meaning like reviews and things or what?
10399286	10409197	Yeah, I mean, if they're not going to treat it underneath fair use, then everybody who openly plays that for longer than five minutes or so needs to pay Nintendo that.
10409277	10413942	And I don't think, like, for instance, Revision 3, their reviews go on for eight or nine.
10413982	10415443	Granted, they're a big name.
10415503	10418146	They'd never undercut them, but the little guys will step all over it.
10419642	10441828	or that I well one thing I was kind of thinking with this is that I'm surprised a lot of people have just said all right we'll just not use YouTube because YouTube could kind of get some of the blame in this too for kind of letting Nintendo or quote-unquote letting Nintendo do it right split their videos up into what I say it's five minutes or 459 you know it's kind of a pain in the ass it's a pain in the ass but you know whatever I mean if that's what needs to be done
10442552	10446133	Well, that's also going to cut into... The viewers aren't going to be there either.
10446433	10451394	And also, you have to take into account how many video game tournaments are paying rights.
10451974	10453975	Because not that many as far as I saw.
10454475	10456655	Unless it's sponsored by the video game company themselves.
10456955	10459656	That means the streams for Team Spooky are also going to be cut out.
10460016	10463017	So they can't show any of the video game tournaments as well as EVO coverage.
10464524	10478339	Yeah, that means going up against Justin.TV, and if they really want to undercut Justin.TV out of that much revenue, then they'd have a court case fight there.
10482552	10483773	I don't think there's an easy answer.
10483833	10489858	I kind of think it's going to go back to that guy on our Facebook that said it's going to take a legal precedent to really figure this out.
10490138	10500566	And although, sure, it was a dick move on Nintendo's part, and I think it would have just been a better situation if they've all split the money or worked with the content people to try to figure out a solution rather than sick the lawyers on them.
10500946	10502107	That probably would have been better.
10502547	10506250	But again, they're not the first to do so, and they won't be the last.
10507011	10508172	Yep, true, true.
10508832	10509533	Other thoughts, Unicor?
10510287	10511407	Now that's pretty much it, man.
10511487	10512288	You guys have a good show.
10512448	10514809	Alright, thanks for tuning in and lending your perspective.
10514869	10515949	One more time for that SoundCloud.
10516009	10518030	It's soundcloud.com slash xenocore?
10518610	10518970	Correct.
10519030	10519510	Give it a listen.
10519530	10520791	I think you'll like a lot of the stuff on there.
10520811	10521411	What kind of music?
10521471	10521871	Chiptune?
10521931	10522211	Rock?
10522251	10522551	What is it?
10523192	10524692	Yeah, it's sponsored by the demo scene.
10524752	10527513	That's what I grew up with, so it tends to mirror that, but it's all over the place.
10527833	10528313	Alright, nice.
10528513	10529094	I'll give it a listen.
10529174	10529794	Alright, take care, buddy.
10530598	10530798	Later.
10530999	10531199	Later.
10547619	10550162	Oh, I thought you were going to say something else with this.
10550222	10554306	Tryon Worlds announced that Rift is going free-to-play this past week.
10554366	10554686	I don't know.
10554807	10556348	I thought that might have been where you were going with this.
10556368	10556809	No, no, no.
10556849	10560773	They had layoffs, so there was a lot of rumors on.
10560973	10569242	They haven't really said how many, but it was like 70%, 80% of the staff was one of the rumors, but I don't think that they said that's far exaggerated.
10570468	10571369	Alright, let's go to the phones.
10571389	10572269	We have another call coming in.
10572309	10573189	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10573209	10573529	Who's this?
10574210	10575190	Hey, it's PrinceBrightStar.
10575330	10576170	Hey, PrinceBrightStar.
10576190	10576631	How you doing?
10577251	10577631	Pretty good.
10577671	10577991	Yourself?
10578211	10578431	Good.
10578491	10579732	You said you were going to listen more often.
10579772	10581552	You've made good on that promise, so thank you.
10582173	10583613	I've tried to make it every week since.
10583933	10584294	Awesome.
10584334	10585114	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
10586234	10590196	I've also got a comment about the whole Let's Play situation as well here.
10590416	10591216	A lot of people do.
10591276	10591576	What's up?
10592477	10598419	Well, I recently started doing Let's Play myself, particularly with Minecraft and
10599680	10615777	also some of the Phantasy Star games I started this back in December but I have yet to monetize any of my stuff because I have yet to actually get into any of those networks but my understanding on the whole situation with Nintendo is they're even monetizing for themselves stuff from
10616717	10619998	The IGN Network, GameStation, and such like that.
10620958	10641181	So I'm wondering if they have actually broken contracts in this, and if it's time for the Let's Player community to actually get together, host some sort of charity drive, or rather a donation drive, which will cover the fees for all this, the lawyer fees, and actually take this to court.
10641201	10643782	Because the laws are just...
10644542	10648326	Very, very out of date at this point to be able to cover something like Let's Plays.
10649347	10651429	You mean fair use laws need to be reexamined?
10652310	10652851	Exactly.
10653051	10659358	Because, I mean, Nintendo may also be cutting into reviews and such which are allowed under fair use.
10660413	10662494	What about some of the things I was saying earlier?
10662654	10677704	I can't put an entire movie up and do talking over the movie, but if I wanted to do a movie review, I could obviously use little bits and pieces, which I could still do with a Nintendo game, but I can't exactly upload that to YouTube where I talk over a movie.
10677844	10679345	Why is it different with games?
10680305	10681845	True, and I agree with that.
10682165	10685766	And in that situation, you can't do it.
10685826	10694168	In fact, what most people do currently is they go and sell their tracks sort of on a site like Rift Tracks or something like that.
10694508	10697829	The problem with video games is they're an interactive medium.
10698389	10702990	So when you're watching a movie, it's going to be the same for everybody regardless.
10703610	10708272	If you're playing a video game, your experience is going to be different.
10709313	10726402	Granted, I respect Nintendo and any other company for doing what they want to do because it's their game, but the gameplay itself and any commentary or putting their face on the video or putting their chat on the video as well, that's their property at that point.
10730207	10743685	What do you think, as a let's play person yourself, let's say something's got to give here and Nintendo wants a little piece of the pie and a little bit of the revenue, what do you think would be a solution that would make everybody happy?
10745637	10758912	I think it's – honestly, I think it's better that this doesn't actually go to court and each company either says you can do whatever you want or cut some sort of fee or say –
10761100	10764182	You can't do this and don't post any videos.
10764242	10768144	Make it clear as to what you're allowed to do, what you're not allowed to.
10768985	10777551	And I think it's also up to the community to respect that and not put out videos that the company states they don't want videos out there.
10778952	10788098	Especially maybe for newer games, you know, having Let's Play a Bioshock Infinite before the game's actually released, when a lot of people want to know, you know, what's the ending?
10788398	10790299	You know, that could be detrimental to the game.
10791340	10791820	Exactly.
10792121	10807591	Or for, in a worst case, a game like, say, Aliens Colonial Marines, if all those reviews hadn't come out so quickly, and I realize this hurts the community even more, but with the reviews and also the embargo that was out,
10809136	10812589	People weren't able to cancel their pre-orders before it was too late on that game.
10813749	10814109	Good point.
10814809	10815049	All right.
10815089	10817650	Well, PrinceBrightStar, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?
10818390	10819150	That's it for tonight.
10819350	10819570	All right.
10819590	10820170	You take care, buddy.
10820210	10820730	Thanks for listening.
10821371	10821611	All right.
10821771	10821991	All right.
10822031	10822351	Bye-bye.
10823791	10825291	We'll try to squeeze in one more call.
10825311	10828732	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10829172	10829932	Other stories, Loki?
10830212	10832213	They said there's going to be another dashboard update.
10832493	10838694	Or there's a rumor that another dashboard update is going to come to the Xbox 360 before the next system comes out.
10838914	10839274	Interesting.
10839375	10845701	Saying that it's going to update the interface again to make it look more like Windows.
10846361	10851326	Do you think this could be because of some of the rumors about the set-top boxes that are going to come out really cheap?
10851586	10856070	I don't know about that, but maybe they're just trying to update it so that it looks nicer or something.
10856150	10857191	I don't know.
10857231	10858833	I just hate when they keep changing the interface, though.
10859413	10861454	Let's go to the phones and take a call.
10861494	10862294	Hi, you're on Orange Lens Radio.
10862314	10862614	Who's this?
10863134	10866396	Hey, this is your opening act for, I guess, this is the last time, I guess.
10866896	10867896	I brought the shots fired.
10868656	10873738	I'll let it slide this one time, but you make another Chrono Triggers better than Super Metroid joke, and it's over.
10874198	10874678	I'm kidding.
10875198	10876039	It's all good fun.
10876099	10876619	What's up, Bobby?
10877159	10884822	So I just wanted to repeat something that I've actually been repeating, and it's one thing that a lot of people don't realize about this whole Nintendo Let's Play thing.
10884982	10885142	Mm-hmm.
10885982	10890307	Just because it's free advertising doesn't mean they have to want it.
10892149	10895573	And I think that's something that a lot of people... They're like, oh, it's free advertising.
10895593	10896173	Why wouldn't they want it?
10896814	10897555	Maybe they don't.
10898584	10901106	Maybe they want to control more of the advertising.
10901566	10904848	And so the argument of it's free advertising, they should be happy with it.
10905309	10911373	There's free advertising that I've gotten over the past eight years that I haven't wanted.
10911493	10912693	Ooh, that's a good analogy.
10913294	10914475	That's a really good analogy.
10914815	10926202	Is that sometimes, you know, like people will say something and kind of like use your site or your show or something and you're kind of like, I don't know if I would necessarily have said that myself type of thing.
10926463	10926963	Yeah, yeah.
10927163	10928124	That's a really good analogy.
10928864	10944102	so you know just because it's free advertising doesn't mean they necessarily want it and I mean the thing like the difference between like Minecraft the reason I fully support Notch for his position is because he's not telling a story in Minecraft he gave an actual sandbox
10945304	10960753	and you're telling your own stories whereas a Let's Play of Luigi's Mansion you're telling the Luigi's Mansion story granted you're going right or left whenever you want to but you're still telling Nintendo's story
10962331	10975841	Yeah, but you can say that sandbox games, you know, say if I go and just run around in Saints Row the Third and just not necessarily play in the story stuff, but just kill people or do silly stuff that that should be fair because it is telling.
10976101	10977442	And I agree with you on that.
10978082	10981805	But that's different than playing the Saints Row the Third story.
10982726	10982986	Hmm.
10984049	10985610	That's kind of where my line is.
10985750	10986470	Yes, absolutely.
10987110	10990051	Screw it around in Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row or Minecraft.
10990591	10992132	Absolutely, that should be fair use.
10992612	10997474	Or Machinima is a great example.
10997574	11001055	Except with Microsoft's game content rules kind of...
11002062	11004583	You have to work out with them if you're going to do Machinima.
11004683	11007083	Yeah, that's true, huh?
11007103	11015286	Microsoft really laid the hammer down on that.
11016346	11016966	Interesting.
11017866	11021487	Well, I don't think that's all of your Let's Play people, but certainly there are some Let's Play people.
11021848	11026069	Hell, we did Mass Effect Drunk the other night, and maybe BioWare didn't appreciate that.
11026209	11026589	I don't know.
11026949	11028871	But once again, though, they need to get with it.
11028971	11036518	I mean, sorry that, you know, Microsoft's not saying that they don't want their games associated with, you know, stoners and loudmouths and stuff like that.
11036538	11040942	But they keep saying that they keep like going back and forth what they want.
11041683	11046107	Oh, we're going to make games that appeal to mass, you know, to, you know, core gamers and stuff.
11046407	11047308	Oh, we're gonna make family games.
11047688	11050831	I don't think they know what their focus is almost.
11050911	11053012	They're trying to appeal to people that aren't buying their system or something.
11053032	11054153	I don't really know what it is.
11054173	11054394	Yeah.
11070887	11073829	But what a really interesting point is that they may not want the advertising.
11074089	11075069	It just kind of makes me think.
11075210	11085116	I'm really appreciative that there's many of you out there that put OLR in your usernames or your clan names or OLR or VOG for VOG and so forth.
11085456	11086437	And I think that's really awesome.
11086457	11087298	It helps spread the word.
11087578	11095263	But you better not be acting like an idiot when you're doing that because then it makes people go, I don't know what this VOG thing is, but what a bunch of assholes.
11095783	11096424	And that's not good.
11097184	11098085	That's not the advertising we want.
11098105	11099206	I don't think it's necessarily that...
11100807	11105731	Maybe these people are fans of those games, and so they're excited about that.
11105771	11108854	It's not necessarily like advertising.
11108874	11110895	I mean, because no one needs to advertise Super Mario Bros.
11110935	11112537	Everyone knows what the fuck Super Mario Bros.
11112657	11114298	is, for the most part.
11114398	11115900	I mean, obviously, we've seen some...
11116480	11122685	Some pictures from Super Mario World and Super Metroid that people don't know how to play.
11123226	11126228	But I'm just saying that, for the most part, people are aware of what it is.
11126288	11132153	It's not necessarily free advertising, but it's just a unique take on it with the Let's Play stuff.
11132213	11136396	Unless you're just straight playing through the game without any sort of commentary on it.
11137577	11141800	It's really hard to say that you're taking anything away from them, I guess.
11142040	11142361	I don't know.
11142621	11142701	Hmm.
11143820	11145700	But it's still, yeah, it's free advertising.
11145720	11147461	But Nintendo may not want that advertising.
11147501	11151522	And maybe they're okay with the Let's Play community saying we're not going to do Nintendo videos anymore.
11151562	11152682	Maybe that's what they want.
11153902	11157303	And so this is, you know, they're kind of doing, oh, yeah, we're the good guys.
11157483	11159083	Oh, well, you didn't want to take our offer.
11159144	11163304	So, you know, okay, have fun doing the Microsoft and the Sony stuff.
11163965	11165465	Well, no, they won't be doing Microsoft either.
11167345	11169746	Yeah, but Microsoft hasn't gone through with YouTube.
11170416	11171056	Not yet.
11171877	11177260	They haven't, but they did kind of make the first move in this whole thing a few months ago.
11177421	11193271	Still, that's even weird, though, that they would, because once again, I would see that as strange if they're going to try to put out these sort of features where they're trying to get people to broadcast on Twitch and broadcast on YouTube and stuff and share all these videos and things.
11193731	11196533	Oh, but we don't want you to do that, or at least don't want you to make money doing it.
11198354	11217832	well pardon me that you tell me how I should make my money Nintendo's not pulling a Sega, Microsoft's not pulling a Sega but they're just saying you can't and at least Microsoft has a licensing path so you can make money from it but you wouldn't be able to recoup the licensing costs unless you were Machinima.com or Revision3 or one of these larger sites
11217912	11229098	Well, what we need to do is we just need to have some sort of reform to this whole you buy the game, you get the game thing instead of it being a license because this is where all the bullshit's coming from is fucking licensing software.
11229338	11230819	It needs to be you own that shit.
11231740	11239844	Not that you can turn around and say, okay, I buy Halo 4, Halo 4 is mine, and I'm going to sell copies of it and claim that it's Loki's Halo 4.
11239904	11245127	Yeah, but that's exactly what you're saying is that in order to own it, you have to be able to do that.
11246041	11251303	I'm sure that we can kind of come to a sort of happy medium where lawyers won't let them.
11252423	11256644	Just straight up piracy that you at least own the stuff that you have.
11257765	11262346	Just because I own a car doesn't mean that I've manufactured those cars.
11262366	11266567	I can't go and clone my car and expect to get away with it, but that car is mine.
11266647	11267988	I can do whatever the hell I want to it.
11269008	11269308	All right.
11269448	11277394	Well, no easy answer to this, and I'm sure the conversation will be continuing through the next few weeks, especially when we see what other companies are going to follow in Nintendo's footsteps, because I bet there'll be at least one.
11277954	11291643	But, Bobby, before I let you go, earlier in the show we were talking about some of our predictions for Tuesday's Xbox announcements, and I was kind of curious, since you are the opening act and everything, as you say, what are your thoughts?
11292984	11294185	I mostly agree with you guys.
11294265	11296867	They're not going to... No price, no date.
11297928	11298008	Um...
11299667	11303734	I do think Xbox Infinity is going to be the name.
11303895	11304896	I know that they'll give the name.
11304937	11306720	I know that they'll show a couple games.
11308324	11336376	but I think they'll talk more about the entertainment offerings and stuff but you gotta realize this is also being broadcast live on TV so this is so they're probably gonna try to reach everything and leave a lot of the core stuff maybe to E3, I don't know I do think it's funny and I mentioned this in chat and I don't think you guys picked up on it about the Space Poncho thing they have gone full board with the Twitter handle XboxRevealTent
11337438	11338159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11351866	11352946	and fully embracing that.
11353547	11357848	That's probably going to be the Space Poncho of this year or at least that's what Microsoft hopes the Space Poncho of this year is going to be.
11357868	11360289	They have to understand you can't force Space Poncho.
11360309	11362169	Space Poncho is just something that happens.
11362689	11363490	It's a natural thing.
11364450	11366390	You can't just make a viral video.
11367151	11368891	The video has to go viral.
11369171	11369852	It's different.
11370912	11371332	Good point.
11371912	11374633	Bobby, looking forward to checking out Gran Turismo 6 when it comes out?
11375413	11376754	Did Gran Turismo 5 ever come out?
11378994	11380555	I will get to play Saints Row 4.
11382282	11382922	Oh yeah, yes.
11383342	11384483	I know you're looking forward to E3.
11384563	11386623	It's only a few weeks away.
11386983	11388043	I've got my appointment time.
11388083	11388863	It's Wednesday morning.
11389084	11389324	Nice.
11389804	11390904	That's when I'll be playing Saints Row 4.
11391024	11393224	They said they're going to have a playable portion.
11393484	11398806	I hope I'm there with you so I can pick up the phone and actually call Loki after that and hand you the phone.
11399346	11401646	Yeah, I got to play Saints Row 4 as well.
11402246	11404367	I downloaded the Trouble with Clones expansion as well.
11405307	11406007	Alright, that's it.
11406067	11406667	We're ending the show.
11406987	11409288	Alright, Bobby, any other quick final thoughts before we let you go?
11410064	11411426	Chrono Trigger greater than Super Metroid?
11411766	11413969	That was a bad final thought and for that I'm hanging up.
11414009	11414309	Goodbye.
11415911	11417052	That would be an incorrect thought.
11419195	11419615	Alright.
11420376	11421757	We're going to close up the Skype line.
11421838	11422498	I'm really sorry.
11422518	11424761	There were a few of you still trying to call that didn't get through.
11424901	11429987	I'm very sorry but we are running a little over and I have to do some things after the show.
11431247	11433568	Do remember you can always tweet us, twitter.com.com.
11433608	11436009	You can also email us, mailbag at orange.trader.com.
11436329	11438210	That's a great way to get all of your thoughts out.
11439091	11442112	Let me, speaking of Twitter, go to the Twitter real quick.
11442612	11445293	Loki, I don't know if you had any other last-minute stories real quick here.
11445313	11445693	Not really.
11445733	11451355	There's just a story that they're going to... I mean, they've already talked about doing this before, but they're replacing Microsoft Points with real money.
11451996	11452096	So...
11453316	11457298	TigerClaw tweeting us that BlazBlue anime is getting a fall release in Japan.
11457378	11459178	I didn't know they were making an anime about BlazBlue.
11459398	11460119	That makes sense.
11460439	11461259	That's pretty cool.
11461279	11464680	They're making a game for Guilty Gear, so that's pretty cool.
11464760	11466041	A good way to kind of enhance things.
11466841	11474024	Misty sending us some tweets from Asen because she was at the show and she tweeted us some pictures from Pinkberry.
11474504	11479506	Thanks for rubbing it in, Misty, because I wish I could be there right now because that cookies and cream flavor is so good.
11480266	11486170	But there's that free advertising that maybe Pinkberry doesn't want the advertising.
11486210	11487370	We keep giving them on our show.
11487410	11489011	We should stop that.
11489291	11493434	Spazinator tweeting us his Facebook fan page for his kitty, Anakin.
11494094	11495335	And that's a cute cat.
11498103	11502647	I'm looking at cat pics, but I like that you set up a whole little Facebook.
11502728	11509114	Smiling Yoshi tweets us and says, Smiling Yoshi wonders if he'll someday be subject to Nintendo's defense of copyrights.
11509614	11511976	I mean, I'm a Yoshi doll, and I'm so darn cute.
11512417	11514038	Oh, I remember this account.
11514119	11517322	This is a Twitter account that's this little dolly Yoshi.
11517342	11517422	Yeah.
11517942	11519325	that makes all these tweets.
11519826	11520747	And it's really cute.
11520827	11522350	See, there's Smiling Yoshi.
11522510	11523392	So it's a little doll.
11523652	11526517	Imagine like a garden gnome that goes everywhere and tweets from all the stuff.
11526537	11527418	Yeah, I have that doll.
11527919	11528300	Oh, okay.
11528320	11528560	There you go.
11528580	11531786	Well, I should say Josh has that doll, but we have that doll in the house.
11532222	11537428	Well, so Smiling Yoshi is worried that maybe Nintendo is going to shut down this Twitter account.
11538649	11539790	I don't think you have anything to worry about.
11540050	11548279	Because at least, you know, I'm looking at your user icon, which is Yoshi kind of setting on your feet or a friend's feet or something like that.
11548619	11550962	And I'm thinking, you know, that picture is like 5% Yoshi and 95%.
11554345	11562230	a body in a room so I think you'd be okay I think I think that would be that would actually be okay with fair use laws just so you know
11563480	11567881	Actdeft tweeting us, Guilty Gear XRD Sign got announced today.
11568301	11569821	Yeah, that's the game I was talking about.
11569901	11571221	I didn't know there was a... Oh, okay.
11571561	11585784	I think it's kind of funny, though, that name, though, you know, XRC Sign or XRD Sign, because it's like all the, you know, games have been like Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus or like, you know, they have like some sort of weird symbol after them.
11586144	11587724	So it's like XRD.
11587804	11591185	It's like X entry into the series and some random sign.
11592629	11594571	And lastly, a tweet from Eric RPG.
11594951	11598034	People often say devs are high when they make game ideas.
11598114	11600016	Here's one put to practice, maybe.
11600376	11604320	And he tweets us a link to something over on Destructoid about the game Demon Sheik.
11607743	11608424	What a novel idea!
11628900	11630361	Do you listen to this show every week, Eric?
11630381	11631981	Because the same thing happened to us.
11633302	11635002	Maybe that's why you tweeted it to us, actually.
11635563	11639544	If only someone would make a game like, you know, Bungie Ferret Tossing.
11639584	11641125	Like we said, it ought to be a game.
11641165	11644606	If only that was available on Xbox Live Indie Games.
11645286	11651888	But anyway, Demon Sheik is apparently a crossbreed between WarioWare, Earthbound, and The Curse of Monkey Island.
11651928	11653708	I don't even know how that goes together there.
11654028	11659469	But I guess if you're a fan of Destructoid's podcast, then there's lots of lulzy in-jokes there for you.
11660049	11661390	Well, fine.
11662030	11665011	If Podtoid's gonna get a game, then you know what I want?
11665351	11666071	You know what I want?
11666371	11667311	I want two games!
11669412	11670912	One game isn't good enough anymore.
11674429	11674750	Alright.
11675631	11675951	Anyhow.
11676932	11679195	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11679736	11681077	Because that was it for Last Minute Stories, right?
11681097	11681258	Yeah.
11681498	11683280	Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show.
11683660	11686384	If you like our show, remember, this is an indie production.
11686444	11689047	We do do everything here, you know, for free.
11689588	11691110	We don't really monetize the show.
11691190	11691310	Like...
11691690	11694775	Maybe we ought to, but we do pay out of pocket to do the show.
11694895	11695696	And you know what?
11695936	11697078	We just love the community.
11697439	11699802	We like paying the money to spend time with our friends every week.
11699962	11701925	All we ask, help us grow our community.
11701985	11706031	Tell a friend or two about the show and help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
11706251	11707673	It helps.
11708414	11712758	Keep showering DarkSakura with gifts because she really likes that too and gets her all of the glint.
11713058	11714219	That was really awesome though.
11714359	11716681	That was a great idea too.
11716721	11721085	I love that because it's something that in turn will just help VOG in general.
11721545	11722386	So that's awesome.
11722967	11727050	Anyhow, before we close up shop, we've got to go around and get final thoughts.
11727811	11728892	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11729932	11738776	My final thought is that I showed quite a bit of self-restraint in this digital games mayhem sale on Amazon.
11739256	11741657	Because I didn't buy a lot of this.
11742618	11744239	I buy random weird shit.
11744379	11745619	But I only bought two things.
11745739	11751542	I bought the Sam & Max collection, which is all three seasons of Sam & Max.
11751622	11754603	So that's like 18 episodes of gaming to play.
11754783	11758145	And then Saints Row 2, because I didn't have it yet on Steam.
11758245	11758365	So...
11759586	11760527	Uh, that'd be pretty good.
11760827	11766572	And, and, and, I need people to give me suggestions for game night.
11766972	11769674	You know, because otherwise I'm just gonna pick something at random.
11770075	11773978	It may end up being Call of Duty or something, because I can't think of...
11775359	11775799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
11795737	11798858	But, you know, it'll be like 8, 8.30ish.
11799698	11809140	And, you know, I think that way we can play a lot longer because, you know, we won't have to worry about, you know, the work day next day for most people.
11810541	11814902	But, yes, let me know on the forums what you want to play so we can consider that.
11816411	11820075	A couple final thoughts from me.
11820795	11823057	I will echo what Bobby Blackwolf in chat is saying.
11823137	11826441	Some VOG announcements coming on June 2nd, so stay tuned for that.
11827221	11831485	Horde House has a big surprise this week, so tune in on Wednesday at 7 o'clock Pacific to hear that.
11831846	11833227	So I guess just plugs from me.
11833707	11834468	So there you go.
11835709	11838352	That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11838692	11844116	We will be back probably in two weeks, but stay tuned to our Twitter just in case we're able to pull out a show during Memorial Day weekend.
11844136	11844657	We'll let you know.
11845017	11846598	But otherwise, have a great week.
11847399	11850000	For those of you in the States, have a great three-day weekend on Memorial Day.
11850321	11853623	For those of you throughout the rest of the world, have a great week, whatever you're doing.
11853863	11855625	And E3's almost here, you guys.
11855665	11856966	Lots of gaming news coming at you.
11858487	11860508	Brace yourselves for this Xbox thing on Tuesday.
11860548	11861269	It should be interesting.
11861609	11864651	Have a great week, everybody, and have fun.
11865032	11865232	Bye.
