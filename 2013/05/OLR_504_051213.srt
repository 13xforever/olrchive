00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May the 12th of 2013, episode number 504 of our show.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and all things gaming and so forth, culture, blah blah blah, lolz.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
With my co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Blar. Blar. Blar.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What happened? Did you eat at Panda Express again?

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, I have my own delicious food, but this week's been shitty.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, that's why you're gonna lose yourself in a super fun chipper episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I would try, but if I may make an announcement to one of our people in chat tonight for Name & Lights, we offer you our condolences. It's a very difficult thing you're going through.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Absolutely, so you know, it's the extended family here at VoG and we're thinking of you guys when you guys have really horrific weeks too.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But not having a bad week, I hope, is Techmaster Loki joining us as well.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was having a great week, up until lunch, because McDonald's, man, I swear, their quality assurance, I swear, their quality assurance is so bad you'd think that they were Bethesda or something.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't say funny stuff while I'm eating.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Just kidding, no, Bethesda's awesome, they check their games way more than McDonald's checks what's actually in the bag.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's your job, you're supposed to check what's in the bag.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm supposed to see the quality assurance, yeah, that's how it works.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't you see the little sign as you pull it out of the drive-thru, check your order, bitch.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here's what was missing. First off, they didn't give me sweet and sour sauce, because we had a ton of nuggets.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then they forgot to give me the nuggets for the Happy Meal for Josh. The main portion of his meal is missing, and my drink.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It might be like a whole other bag somewhere, but anyway, you've got real problems.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You've got real problems, Loki, real problems.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Anyhow, also joining us, say hello to the chatters. We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And you can join us in chat at live.vog.net.com if you happen to be listening to us live.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Speaking of Bobby Black Wolf, we always do a little phone call with him at the end of every show, and I forgot during the phone call tonight,

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
because I got distracted by Loki's late arrival, but I forgot to wish Bobby Black Wolf a happy birthday.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Happy anniversary of your hatching.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's right. His 29th birthday is today for the seventh or eighth time.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He actually has me convinced he's 29 now. He keeps lying about it every year, but we hope you have a great birthday.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I wrote him a Commodore 64 BASIC program for his birthday on Facebook.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is it the bouncing ball?

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I haven't done that in a long time. No, it just, it prints happy birthday 29 times and then says, sorry, this program will only count to 29.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There you go.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I need to do more programming. I haven't done a lot of that in a long, long, long time.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So, but I'm too busy doing a radio show. What can I say?

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So anyway, happy birthday to Bobby Black Wolf. Also, happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there, whether that be, you know, having kids, having pets.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Kitty moms, kitty moms.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Mother figures, Mr. Moms, you know, whatever, grandmoms, moms-to-be, all those things.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Happy Mother's Day to all of you and hope you forgot, or hope you forgot, hope you didn't forget to call your mother.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So, or whoever is important to you on this day.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I texted mine today and tried to call her and I sent grandmama a text.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I haven't been super hubble about it, but my grandmoms in the hospital, which is why I'm going to Alabama.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Right.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So I sent my grandmama a text and then I got a call from my granny after I left her message.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So I have spoken with maternal people in my life.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Good.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And as has my husband. Spoken with his maternal figure and her maternal figure.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now, I called my mom, but we're doing Mother's Day stuff tomorrow because my mom is very much like, well, not just because of this show.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I mean, I mean, she would understand that.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But I didn't take her out to brunch or anything because she hates the crowds at restaurants more than I do.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She's like, I don't want to go out today. It's too crowded.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So we're going tomorrow.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And you know where my mom likes to go? You know what her favorite restaurant is?

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is so bad. You know what my mom's favorite restaurant is where she likes to go?

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What?

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Chevy's.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You know what?

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Didn't I tell you about that last week?

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't knock on Chevy's because they have actually a really super good salad.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
All right.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Coming up later on the show in just a little while, we're going to be talking to Joe.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He is the creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone, which is a documentary all about The Legend of Zelda and Zelda fandom.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And you can check out more about that on Kickstarter or we've linked it on Twitter and so forth.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And we'll link it when we post the show on on Vogue and OrangeOnTwitter.com and all that, of course.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We'll be talking to him just a little later, about 15 minutes.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So to make time for the interview, I don't have a kickoff off topic tonight.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So we're going to get right into how was your gaming week?

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How was your gaming week?

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, I've been trying to keep myself super distracted just because of all the stuff going on in my family.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I've been playing Tomb Raider.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I started Saints for the third and then promptly turned it off because I forgot that I had left it running while I went to bed

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
because I kind of passed out from four glasses of Umeshu.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I've been doing a lot of drinking this week. I don't know if you noticed. My poor liver.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I started playing Ragnarok Online 2 now that they finally got the shit working and it's so cute.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And there's like pourings and flips and they're cute and you can smack the shit out of them.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You start off the game smacking the shit out of pourings. That's the best way to start a game.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And those little bastards thankfully don't steal your shit anymore.

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's good fan service too.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah. Oh, no, all the same animals, all the same creatures and everything are there.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You remember me taking you on the vocal hunt in the old days on the old Ragnarok?

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The stupid grasshopper with the guitar?

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You actually get to fight Vocal. You get to find all the same little rare spawns all over the place except now they're kind of like mini bosses.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And some of the job classes have been turned into like the blacksmith profession is actually now a job instead of a fighter class.

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So that's kind of what they did in 14 a little bit.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah. But I've been having a good time with it and I think I'm definitely going to quit well just because I have not been having a good time in Oh My God Pandas.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And that and think about how much space I'll get off my hard drive and maybe Diablo as well now that I can keep Diablo for free because I've done my servitude to the Activision gods.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You've held up your end of the blood pact.

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes. Now my blood is mine.

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I have also been playing a game called Off which I am now to the first like world after whatever area zero is.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And it's weird and I like it except I wish I could play it windowed but I kind of understand why you can't because of how the game is programmed.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So it's very weird and I suggest that everybody in the universe play it because it's fucking weird.

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And I'm going to go ahead and count this in my gaming week is I've been kept I've been rereading like all of Homestuck.

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And so I've been actually playing through all the little mini flash games and everything to the point that I'm thinking about reteaching myself flash to do a few little mini games for bog.

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah just fun stuff.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why not?

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Practice. I am also, did I say Tomb Raider? Yeah I was playing Tomb Raider or Lara Croft's Really Shitty Day or what did Alan call it? Girl.

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah girl.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Girl.

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The game. Girl.

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And I'm also playing Mass Effect 3 again because I'm live streaming it so that I can completely make fun of the game live on air.

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And I have adjusted my time slot so that I do not overlap Loki's streaming.

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Or anything else on VOG of course.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah screw all them. No I'm kidding. No I have been. Oh did you change your picture to Clue?

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes. Don't talk about what I'm doing on the computer over here.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sorry I like Clue.

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Terrible radio.

112
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I like Clue.

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah no I do too.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We need to do like an online tabletop RP Clue.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
RP Clue?

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah if it was like a VOG thing that would be hilarious.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well I've been working hard on the shadow casting here in Sacramento so if you happen to be local July 27th I'm playing Colonel Mustard in Clue. It'll be fun. It's gonna be fun.

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Please there are ladies present.

119
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Alright Loki tell us about your gaming week.

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This week I played, what did I play this week? Well I know I played Forza because we did the VOG gaming night and stuff and we've been averaging one extra person each week.

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So next week yeah that'll be awesome. Next week is gonna be Grand Theft Auto 4 on the free room because that was Bobby's suggestion.

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I wasn't gonna do it because you know I mean I love Grand Theft Auto.

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I actually have Grand Theft Auto 4 and I would have no idea what I'm doing so that might be a lot of fun.

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
On 360?

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Do I or do I have it on PS3? Isn't that sad? I don't even know. I think I have it on 360.

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You should have it on 360. It's awesome.

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But and in hindsight I was actually gonna loan you a copy if you didn't have it but I forgot to bring one so oh well.

128
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So yeah we're gonna be doing that and then yeah so you'll be joining in that'll be fun. We'll just be messing around driving around.

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You wanna know what's hilarious about that? It's still in the shrink wrap.

130
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That sounds like games at my house Rob.

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That is a crime.

132
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You know what's funny? Alan has been like really into Grand Theft Auto 4 lately but he's been playing it all on PC.

133
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I know.

134
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And just the other day I turned around to ask him a question and I just saw some stripper like fully ass nude on his computer you know titties and hoo-ha and all that.

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I was like what are you playing? How dare you?

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Vagirator.

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So yes that'll be fun. I finished also Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 the campaign and that so that was okay.

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And what else?

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I know I played some PC games this week.

140
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Well I played one PC game but you know I could say what it is but I can't tell you anything about it other than what it was.

141
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Stay tuned to vognetwork.com.

142
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah it's a game that's coming out next week so you'll have to see what my opinion was.

143
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's right.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Tomorrow.

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So yeah I guess that was it.

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's it?

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
My game of the week. A lot of the same old stuff.

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
World of Warcraft obviously because unlike Dark Sakura I still play an awful lot.

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Although I've kind of learned how to have fun by myself in a while because a lot of my friends are quitting left and right.

150
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But we still have the Horde House Guild which is nice because I still see some people on there occasionally so I can at least be a little social.

151
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And I even ran random dungeons with some people last night that I didn't even know I just knew through the show guild.

152
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But I had fun.

153
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But I've been playing a lot more PvP which is kind of how I've been entertaining myself.

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And I know a lot of people are like oh my god I'm so scared of PvP because people are mean and so on.

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But I've just been having fun with it and when people are mean right click ignore and I never have to see their ass again.

156
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's awesome.

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But I've also been playing some console games.

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
One of the new games I've been playing lately, we got an email the other week.

159
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I think it was last week or the week before that said Rob do you ever actually play the games that you get for free on PlayStation Plus and why aren't you talking about them on the show?

160
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well I did that this week. I actually got one of the free games on PlayStation Plus called Labyrinth Legends.

161
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I think this game came out last year but it's free on PlayStation Plus now.

162
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's a download game on PlayStation Network.

163
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Best way I could describe it is it's a roguelike game if you know what that is.

164
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's like a dungeon crawler and roguelike is because it's like this old old old game back on terminal computers called Rogue which was a lot of fun when I was younger.

165
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But it's like that. You're kind of crawling around a dungeon and it's a lot of puzzle solving.

166
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You know there will be doors and keys and levers that open things and so forth and monsters you have to kill.

167
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But maybe they keep spawning unless you do this one thing.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
For example you have to move blocks around in a certain pattern to open a door but the room is filled with gas.

169
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So in order to be in there to move the blocks in enough time you have to go kill this guy to get a gas mask.

170
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And then you only get like 30 seconds to do it otherwise you have to go back and get another gas mask.

171
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So it's kind of one of those things where a lot of it is muscle memory and it will take you forever to get through the labyrinth the first time.

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But then once you kind of figure it out it's like you can speed run it and then you might get your little bonus for getting the time trial unlock.

173
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And like each dungeon has five stars and they're very well hidden so sometimes there's like hidden walls and breakaway walls.

174
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So you know a fun little time waster. It's not a very long game from what I understand.

175
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Especially if what I see on the main screen is the only dungeons there is.

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't know if they had planned to expand this through DLC or what have you.

177
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But for the price of free being a PlayStation Plus subscriber I really can't complain.

178
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It was a fun little waste of time.

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So that was one of the other games I've been playing this week.

180
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Other than that I can't really think of a lot.

181
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Virtual console stuff on Wii U has been my other little obsession.

182
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Playing Mega Man, Mario World, Kirby, looking forward because I hear Super Mario 2 is out next week so I'll give you an excuse to play that again.

183
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And you know what else is out next week? Big deal. Big deal guys.

184
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Super Metroid. Yes.

185
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't you already have Super Metroid?

186
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I have Super Metroid on an actual cartridge for that Super Nintendo sitting right over there.

187
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But I will play it again on the Wii U because it's an amazing excuse to play through it again.

188
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And plus it'll be slightly different coming through the speakers on the little gamepad and TV.

189
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And I'm all about playing Super Metroid in as many different ways as I possibly can.

190
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So there you go. That was pretty much my gaming week.

191
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So a little bit of housekeeping before we get into tonight's news and our interview coming up in just a few more minutes.

192
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I want to say of course if you're not following us on Twitter you really ought to be.

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

194
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And we're also on Facebook as well where you can get the Fugu Question of the Week there and Google Plus.

195
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio all one word.

196
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Or you can follow us on Google. Google Plus. Just search for OrangeLoungeRadio.

197
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
YYR in chat at live.vognetwork.com says isn't Super Metroid going to be 30 cents?

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Correct. Yes it is only going to be 30 cents and YYR follows that up with then everyone should be buying it.

199
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Correct. If you actually own a Wii U and you have a way to pay for things online.

200
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I realize not everybody has a credit card.

201
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But you seriously should go to Target and get the $5 card just so you can buy this game.

202
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And if you get it quickly you can get Kirby for 30 cents still too. Just saying.

203
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Koopa Kid Jeremy in chat room from Koopa Club. Howdy.

204
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Says Super Metroid should be purchased in every form. Agree.

205
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
See? Jeremy knows what's up. He understands.

206
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Super Metroid greater than everything else.

207
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Alright let's get into some news. Let's do at least one of our news items real quick. Loki.

208
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Except for Super Super Metroid.

209
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That'd be funny.

210
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Well and I never got into Metroid Prime as much as I did the 2D new Metroids.

211
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What if they did a Super Metroid 2?

212
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well I mean-

213
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Hey I understand the 3-

214
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Zero Mission and Fusion kinda.

215
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's more of a remake sort of.

216
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If they did something in the Super Metroid universe on the 3DS akin to what they're doing with Zelda.

217
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'd have a nerd boner. I would.

218
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
How could you not?

219
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I love the 2D Metroids. The 3D ones aren't bad. I really enjoy the third game in the 3D series.

220
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
For some reason. I know a lot of people hated that one.

221
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And I even like the DS Prime Hunters thing. That was a cool little concept.

222
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's not the same. Like when you get all Doom up in here with my Metroid.

223
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Like it's not the same. It's not bad. But I'm not as like fanboy as I am over something like Super Metroid.

224
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Anyway. News.

225
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Anyways. So Sony's definitely trying to get more indie games on their services.

226
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And one way they're planning on doing that is actually waiving the license fee for PlayStation Mobile.

227
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Now PlayStation Mobile's on pretty much everything.

228
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
PlayStation including Vita and PSP.

229
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
As well as PlayStation Mobile approved phones.

230
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You know. Whatever that might be.

231
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Originally they were paying $99. Now it's free.

232
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And they're trying to get I guess the barrier of entry even lower than it was.

233
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Which I think $99 isn't that bad.

234
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's kind of like what it was with XNA.

235
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
On top of that they are adding an indie game section to the PlayStation Network.

236
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And you can actually find this. It should be available now.

237
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And they are featuring all sorts of games.

238
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Some of the bigger named indie titles like Retro City Rampage, Papayo, and Dyad.

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That kind of stuff.

240
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But definitely a step in the opposite direction than Microsoft is taking.

241
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Do you think that this could be in response?

242
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Like this is a place where maybe they see that Microsoft is vulnerable right now having done what they did with XNA.

243
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Where Sony's like hmm maybe we should just kind of pluck that idea and implement it.

244
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well I think that they see a lot of popularity with the indie scene kind of rising up again.

245
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
With Kickstarter projects and just indie games in general.

246
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Steam Greenlight and that kind of stuff.

247
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And so if it's easy for people to bring that content that may be on PC right now to the PlayStation Network.

248
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Then they're all for it.

249
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's more eyes on the PlayStation Network and more reason to buy a console that plays those games.

250
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm sure Retro City Rampage, a pretty good example, Hotline Miami.

251
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I think that's coming or already out for the Vita and PlayStation 3.

252
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Lots of games like that.

253
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So yeah it's definitely good.

254
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Promote more people to come to your platform.

255
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Definitely better than go away.

256
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
YYR in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

257
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Personally I think the removal of the $99 fee is just because they want to increase the number of titles available.

258
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Well certainly. Anything to add value to the Vita I think is going to be something Sony's going to want to explore.

259
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
For real.

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
YYR also follows that up with,

261
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Microsoft is actually paying $100 to anyone who submits a Windows 8 app through the end of June.

262
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah but that's Windows 8. No one wants to submit a Windows 8 app.

263
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Going back a story a minute here because this is something we neglected to mention during Metroid talk.

264
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But Tigerclaw in chat says,

265
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Metroid Other M was more of a direct sequel to Super Metroid.

266
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I forgot about that. I think a lot of people do because it wasn't developed by Nintendo.

267
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It was that whole Team Ninja third party experiment thing.

268
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I didn't hate Metroid Other M as much as some people did.

269
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But obviously I didn't remember it either.

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So I think that kind of tells you where Other M is.

271
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And Metroid Other M kind of sounds like, you know.

272
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It was a weird title too.

273
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Coca Cola classic. You know it's the UnCola.

274
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I guess that would be 7-Up.

275
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Titles are so important and I think a lot of times people kind of forget that.

276
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I mean I get that they want to get a title that really conveys the message of the story of the game or whatever.

277
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And I get it but there's so many more people that would have just been like,

278
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh Super Metroid 2? Other M? Heck yeah!

279
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You know I think that carries a lot of weight that sometimes people forget about.

280
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Anyway.

281
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What else do I want to ask on the indies? Going back to the indies for a minute.

282
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Do you think this is going to be embraced by the indie community?

283
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Not so much Sony but do you see that people would be like,

284
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah I'm going to develop for the Vita.

285
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't know how easy it is to develop for the Vita.

286
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But I know a lot of those Kickstarter projects you see.

287
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You always see Wii U as actually a platform.

288
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
As okay my indie title is going up on Wii U which is kind of interesting.

289
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I mean it couldn't hurt.

290
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think if they are struggling with financing then definitely removing that fee would help.

291
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Hopefully get more games on there.

292
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Hopefully that doesn't mean that's going to dilute the games that are on there.

293
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Like with a lot of garbage indie games and stuff.

294
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Sorry about the little ding dong by the way.

295
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
My Facebook thing decided to go off.

296
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Which I hate that stupid beep beep on Facebook.

297
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You can't turn it off.

298
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You heard what you're going to be able to expect coming soon.

299
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Auto playing video ads.

300
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm just ready to leave Facebook forever.

301
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Can't wait.

302
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hi dead air.

303
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I just completely am really.

304
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I've turned off every type of notification I possibly can for Facebook.

305
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And now they've actually started being able to bypass my ad block.

306
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Rama and Chet says you can disable it.

307
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Well I need to do my more research.

308
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But I'll have to do that later because it is time to bring on to the show Joe.

309
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And Joe is a creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone.

310
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's a movie that is a Zelda documentary.

311
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And we're going to try to get him on the line right now to talk about this Kickstarter project.

312
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And the movie which has a trailer which you can watch if you go over to the Kickstarter page.

313
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And search for It's Dangerous to Go Alone.

314
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Or if you just search for Zelda movie you'll probably find it and you can see the trailer.

315
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And check out what this project is all about.

316
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But I believe Joe is with us right now.

317
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Joe you there?

318
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What's up man?

319
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Hey how you doing Joe?

320
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I am excellent.

321
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Just enjoyed a beautiful day at the beach in sunny Sarasota Florida.

322
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I really appreciate you taking the time out to come on our show.

323
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I know it's Mother's Day and all that.

324
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah actually we were planning to be on location in the Everglades believe it or not today.

325
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But we had to cancel the shoot because it was Mother's Day and postponed.

326
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Well you know we're out in California.

327
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So I associate everything Florida with Disney World.

328
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And four of my closest friends are all at Disney World right now.

329
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But not me.

330
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's hilarious.

331
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Not me I know.

332
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Alright we're not here to talk about Disney.

333
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
We are here to talk about Zelda.

334
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes sir.

335
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah tell us a little bit about your project Joe.

336
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well it's a couple years ago I was actually playing with my production partner up in Baltimore when I was living up there.

337
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We were playing through Zelda 2 because we'd never beat it as kids.

338
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And we just went on a mission and bought a bunch of alcohol and played through Zelda 2.

339
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And started conceiving of a documentary project that we could do about the ubiquity and cultural influence of The Legend of Zelda.

340
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And we had a lot of artistic friends who were either filmmakers or musicians or artists or writers or whatever.

341
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We all grew up together playing those games and it was sort of our first opening of our imaginations was through the world of Hyrule.

342
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And so it kind of planted a seed of an idea of hey that would make for a cool documentary someday.

343
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And all of our other projects are wrapped up or whatever.

344
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And a couple years later I found myself in a perfect time to film that exact movie.

345
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And started putting the feelers out and we started doing some research, started doing some legal work.

346
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And found just a trove of awesome people that are legitimate artists and filmmakers and out in Hollywood.

347
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And illustrators for Google and best selling authors and all these people that wanted to be involved and that were hugely inspired by the franchise.

348
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And we said yes this is a really cool project that we want to do.

349
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So that's how it started and it's been very cool getting it up and running.

350
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So hearing you talk about that and watching the trailer would you say that this movie is less about necessarily Zelda and Link and the characters than the story.

351
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But it's much more about the fans and the culture?

352
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah I'm not going to say it's void of talking about Zelda of course.

353
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But it's definitely more about not the fandom necessarily but how it has impacted us in a cultural way.

354
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's such a profound way that it's hard to even estimate.

355
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
For instance as kids we're all playing this child's video game and our parents definitely don't get it.

356
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We're six, seven years old. We're playing this Nintendo game.

357
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And at that time me and my best friend we'd play through these worlds and all the way up through A Link to the Past.

358
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We were really passionate about it. We were really into it.

359
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And that best friend that I had growing up with that game, he now works for the military doing cyber security.

360
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Like protecting our government accounts against the Chinese and all that stuff that you're hearing in the news now.

361
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That's his job and his first foray into technology was Nintendo games.

362
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That was his first passion for it.

363
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So it's really interesting to see where all these Zelda fans, that was their first big experience with art or technology or fantasy.

364
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Where they've ended up and all the cool things that they're doing now.

365
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And they kind of owe a lot of their art or love for fantasy to that franchise.

366
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So what notes do I play on the ocarina to unlock those big bank accounts? That's what I want to know.

367
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That is an excellent, excellent question. I'll tell you what, that will definitely help fund.

368
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
If you find out, let me know. The film will do a little bit better.

369
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Well, you know, I gotta say, my memories of Zelda myself.

370
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Zelda, and specifically that game, was how I got to become more popular in elementary school.

371
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You were that guy too. People would come to you and ask you, where is that thing? And you would know.

372
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yes, because I wasn't good at sports or any of that, so I got picked on all the time.

373
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But around the fourth grade or so, when Zelda first came out, it was like, Rob, I know you do nothing but play video games.

374
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
How do I find the fourth dungeon in the second quest? Whatever it is, it's awesome.

375
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The first girl I ever had a crush on, the first phone call I ever got from a girl that I had a crush on was about Zelda 2.

376
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
She had questions about Zelda 2.

377
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That's awesome.

378
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So I feel you, man. I'm right there with you.

379
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And this is exactly the thing. Here you are doing a podcast on gaming.

380
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And really, if it wasn't for games like that, you might not be doing what you're doing.

381
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Absolutely.

382
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's fascinating to look at that and where people have come.

383
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So why did you turn to Kickstarter? You're asking for $50,000 to fund the project.

384
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So what is the $50,000 for and ultimately why should we consider backing it?

385
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Ah, because it's awesome.

386
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Well, first of all, we're competing with, say, the My Little Pony documentary, which got funded for $322,000.

387
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:53,000
For those people who aren't filmmakers or don't know, for those of you who are filmmakers, you probably know that $50,000 is a very, very small budget.

388
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
That's a micro-budget production.

389
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:04,000
For those of you who aren't into film or have never really worked on a film, first of all, a lot of that money for this project especially is going to go towards legal.

390
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:14,000
We've already been working with a legal team because we want to stay on the right side of fair use since this is somebody else's intellectual property that we're sort of focusing on.

391
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And so far, so good. I mean, this project, everything that we're doing stays on that side of it.

392
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But still, we need to dot our lowercase j's and make sure that everything's kosher.

393
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So legal is going to be a big chunk of that. But another big chunk is the travel expenditures.

394
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:41,000
This isn't just a documentary where we're gathering a bunch of YouTube videos and we've got a podcast mic and we're talking over them and explaining the history of the series through gameplay videos or something.

395
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:58,000
We're actually really trying to get some unique one-on-one personal stories with people like Howard Phillips, who started Nintendo Power, and the guys from Rainfall that did that awesome April Fool's Day trailer for The Legend of Zelda for IGN a couple years ago.

396
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Which was awesome.

397
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah, yeah. And these are all people that we've talked to that either we've already got interviews with or they're lined up.

398
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
We're going to have way more footage than we're going to be able to fit inside of our 90-100 minute documentary.

399
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But we want to travel to these places and sit down with these people and see what they're doing now with their lives and find out how exactly Zelda has inspired them and how they've maintained with the series as they've grown up and become adults.

400
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Their children are now playing the games and see their impressions of it.

401
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So because of that, we're going to be traveling a lot and a lot of the money is for travel.

402
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A lot of it is also for the distribution.

403
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Once the film is complete, how do you get it out there?

404
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
We could just put it up on YouTube, but that's not the kind of film that we're creating.

405
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You want something on the big screen.

406
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The physical media, digital distribution channels, things like that.

407
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So that's where really the money is going to be going.

408
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And like I said, $5 million is a low-budget film.

409
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
$50,000, that's a micro-budget documentary film.

410
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And the reason I think we turned to Kickstarter, we really wanted to do a crowdfunding.

411
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,000
We've actually got a couple of decent offers as far as people who want to back this project in more traditional terms like investment-wise or producer-wise.

412
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And that will be awesome and if the Kickstarter doesn't work out, we'll pursue those.

413
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But we love the idea of Kickstarter and this being a project where we're not trying to appease investors.

414
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
This is a project for the community.

415
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
This is a project that belongs to the community.

416
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Everyone has a little piece of it.

417
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Okay, awesome.

418
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Well, speaking of community, we have our live listeners assembled in the live chat room live.vognetwork.com

419
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
if you're listening live on this Sunday night.

420
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And if you have a question for Joe about this project, It's Dangerous to Go Alone, the movie, send us a question.

421
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And we'll possibly read it and ask it of Joe.

422
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Well, lately it's just been a debate over what the best Zelda game is.

423
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Is that what's going on in the chat right now?

424
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I side with the Link to the Past people.

425
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Me too, but I know there's a lot of ocarina.

426
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Well, you know what's funny about that?

427
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm of the same school and just out of curiosity, how old are you guys?

428
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
37.

429
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
34.

430
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Okay, I'll be 33 in a couple of days.

431
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So we're all kind of in that age where we grew up with all the Zelda games, you know?

432
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And I'm curious about the young people who started with 3D Zelda games.

433
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
If they go back and play Link to the Past, do they have that same experience?

434
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But the one thing that makes me think that maybe they do, and we're examining this in the documentary too, by the way, a little bit.

435
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
There's as much excitement and anticipation for the sequel to Link to the Past as there is for the Wii U Zelda.

436
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes.

437
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I think that's really telling as far as how compelling that game was and how the 3D element is awesome and the visual element is great, but that doesn't make the game necessarily.

438
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You know, a good story makes a good game.

439
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Exactly.

440
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Especially in that series.

441
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And I think, though, that there has to be elements of gameplay that, you know, are just the right level of frustrating versus rewarding for your frustration to make it feel like it gives it replay value.

442
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That's why, I hate to say it, Zelda 2 for me, I learned how to be a potty mouth with that game.

443
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I tell you what, we relearned a couple years ago when we played it through again.

444
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
We were cursing like 10-year-olds. It was awesome.

445
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You should hear me and my husband whenever that game gets broken out at my house. It's just like, ah!

446
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:38,000
But honestly, I think that Link to the Past took the formula from the first game that everyone seems to like so much better and really perfected it.

447
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And if they can keep that going with the sequel, then I think the sequel is going to be successful.

448
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And then you might see a bigger console release following suit and, man, that would be awesome.

449
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:57,000
With the capabilities you'd have for a Wii U title, to be gameplay-wise more like Link to the Past, I would be really curious to see where they could go with that.

450
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I think Bobby Blackwolf, who's always on before us here at VOG Network, he has a good comparison that probably applies here, too.

451
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Because he always talks about Final Fantasy and that your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that was out when you were 13.

452
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So, probably with Zelda, a lot of that's true, too.

453
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah, your first experience in that universe, definitely.

454
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And it is something that we're examining. Actually, there's a writer, and I'm not going to talk too much about it.

455
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And right now, you have to just wait for the movie.

456
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But if we include his segment, he talks a little bit about the difference between cinematic storytelling in games and video games themselves and almost creates two different mediums.

457
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And he talks about how console games currently, they're more like cinematic experiences rather than true game experiences.

458
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And there's a really strong divide between the two.

459
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And the more recent console games for Zelda and stuff and for everything have gone more towards that cinematic experience.

460
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But a game like the sequel to Link to the Past will be back to the center is not the story. The center is the gameplay mechanics.

461
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And the story is almost incidental. They still want it to be very strong, but that's not the focus. The focus is the game itself.

462
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And it's a really interesting thing to think about.

463
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Well, let me ask you this question since I did bring up another franchise a minute ago that has a lot of fan passion, too.

464
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Final Fantasy, absolutely.

465
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Well, why did you go with Zelda? Why not Final Fantasy, Mario, Samus? Why not another character that we remember when we were young?

466
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Why did you go for Link and Zelda?

467
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I think we're going to talk, it's not just going to be about Zelda. There's also a lot that talks about just 8-bit gaming and why that survived in general.

468
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And why that, there hasn't been a crash since the 8-bit era. The gaming industry has grown and grown and grown since then.

469
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
That was the seed that planted it, it became what it is today because of the NES era games.

470
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And so it's not just necessarily about Zelda, but that's the core of it, Zelda.

471
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And why Zelda over the other franchises? We just found that it was absolutely ubiquitous, just everywhere.

472
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And, I mean, Final Fantasy, you could probably find the same thing for somebody who's in love with Final Fantasy.

473
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Myself, I just, again, finally played through all of Final Fantasy VI and beat it a month ago.

474
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I played it three times. The first time when I was a kid I never beat it.

475
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The second time I was in college and I was using an emulator and that computer crashed.

476
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Finally I beat it, you know? So I'm a big Final Fantasy lover, too.

477
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But there's something about The Legend of Zelda that separates it.

478
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And I wish, part of the purpose of this documentary is investigating that exact question.

479
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That game, I feel like gaming wouldn't exist in its current form had it not been for the original Legend of Zelda.

480
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It might never have grown into what it is without those early franchise games, and I think that was one of the core ones.

481
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You know, we all, at 5, 6, 7, to 10 years old, we all felt this connection to that reality for some reason.

482
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
True. Let me follow that up with a comment in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com from mm2k who says,

483
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I think you had to be around at that time to fully appreciate the impact of the original 8-bit franchises.

484
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I love docs like these because they truly underscore the impact these titles had on the gaming culture.

485
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Newer gamers should see when gameplay trumped cinematics and cutscenes.

486
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Dark Soccer, you had another question for Joe?

487
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I did, actually. Have you also been exploring, since you're looking at the genre of that type of game as well,

488
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:29,000
are you also looking at some of the, for lack of a better description, clones on other systems, like Neutopia that came out for the TurboGrafx-16?

489
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Even Legend of the Valkyrie was kind of the same.

490
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Sort of. There's a point, again, there's so much footage that's going to be shot for this documentary,

491
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
we're going to have to really make some difficult decisions in the editing room.

492
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But there was a point where we talked a little bit about Crystallis for the NES.

493
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Not a different system, but what Zelda could have evolved into had there been another NES release.

494
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And we talk a lot about that.

495
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And we don't get too much into cross-platform, mostly because I guess we're all,

496
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
and you were either a Nintendo kid or you were a Sega kid when growing up.

497
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And it sounds like you guys were both Nintendo kids, so you understand.

498
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
No, no, this one was a Sega, very much a Sega kid.

499
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Leave the room now, you're no longer in my new talk. Sorry, you're out of the conversation.

500
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Wait a minute, she was a Sega adult, I guess.

501
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
No, my husband grew up with a Master System and a Genesis.

502
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I grew up with my NES, and my brother's SNES when they moved, I bought my SNES,

503
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
and then my husband said, look, Sega Saturn, and I forgot everything else existed.

504
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And now my favorite system to this day is the TurboGrafx.

505
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Interesting. No, it's funny, and I love it too, because it's so fun to see the people's devotion to there.

506
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And when I was a kid, it was Nintendo. F everybody else, screw Sega, no.

507
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I won't hear it, I won't believe you.

508
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And the fandom, it's not just fandom, it's like your family member,

509
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
like someone's talking bad about someone in your gang.

510
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It pained me when I jumped ship to PlayStation. It pained me.

511
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah, yeah, really. And you almost are offended when your favorite releases aren't released on your console.

512
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah.

513
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Why? Why is Final Fantasy not on a Nintendo console anymore? What happened, you know?

514
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And that was exactly it. Exactly it.

515
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh, just look for the N64 demo, and then you'll realize why.

516
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Let me get to some questions from chat. We have a good one here from SSJ100Matt who has a question for you.

517
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
What's Nintendo's stance on the project? Have they contacted you, or have you contacted them?

518
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And the reason why I ask this is because I noticed with documentaries on a specific subject matter,

519
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
tend to get some type of resistance by the original creators wanting to have their own stamp on the project,

520
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
or have it told in a certain light.

521
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Right, well, and that's a really tricky question. We have tried to reach out to Nintendo,

522
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
but there's literally a million people per day with a project that try and reach out to Nintendo.

523
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So we do have sort of a second-degree contact with Nintendo Legal,

524
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
but we haven't really gotten any word back from them.

525
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Fortunately for this project, our project is not about The Legend of Zelda per se.

526
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
We're not examining the particular artwork of the games or the stories of the games.

527
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
We're really examining how the public reacted to that artwork and how they responded

528
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and how it sort of gave them their own artistic appreciation for gaming

529
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
or spawned their love for art or creativity or music or whatever.

530
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So in that way, there's not really a lot of legal area that we have to worry about with appeasing Nintendo,

531
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
because it's not directly related to Nintendo. It's about Nintendo, this game's influence on other people.

532
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And we've been working very close with the legal team, making sure that everything sort of falls in fair use.

533
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And because of that, we have to make some executive decisions, which we wish we didn't.

534
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And there's things we want to include that are kind of gray areas that we're sort of having to scrape off.

535
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But all in all, we haven't run into any problems with Nintendo Legal yet. We're hoping that continues.

536
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But even if there is a problem with Nintendo Legal, it would break our hearts because we hope that they support this project.

537
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But it's not going to stop the documentary just because of the nature of the documentary.

538
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay. Let me ask you this, because of course when it comes to Nintendo,

539
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
the fanboys are pretty infamous in their passion for a lot of the Nintendo stuff.

540
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And somebody linked me a thread on a Nintendo news website where the project got some cold reception.

541
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
What would you say to people that aren't getting this or think that you're trying to profit off Nintendo's IPs?

542
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh man, there's so much stuff I wish I could talk about right now,

543
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
but I am unable to talk about it until the Kickstarter campaign is complete, because of Kickstarter's legal.

544
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I don't mind if people are criticizing the take on the documentary.

545
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
They just don't like this or think it's appropriate.

546
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
They don't like me or my voice or my style or the filmmaking,

547
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
or they thought that the motion graphic title at the end was cheesy or whatever.

548
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I don't mind that kind of criticism. I've been doing film for a long time.

549
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm used to people liking it and people hating it.

550
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I don't like the people who think that we're profiteering off this project.

551
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
We're probably not going to see a dime from this project.

552
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I can't really go into much detail beyond that,

553
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
but I will say that the profits beyond production costs will not be going to us.

554
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That's all I can say about that.

555
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
As far as the people who don't like the style, there's people who want to hate things on the Internet.

556
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They see something, they're worried that we're going to destroy their childhood.

557
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But for every one of those people, there's probably a thousand people that have contacted me and said,

558
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Thank you for validating my entire childhood.

559
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
My fiancé can attest to it. The first day I saw some of those negative reviews,

560
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm like, Why? No, I'm trying to do something. You'll like it.

561
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
After that, enough people prompted me that, Hey, no, man, you've got to finish this.

562
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I really want to see this. It made me feel a lot better about it.

563
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I think people will enjoy it.

564
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Well, there's an old saying we have here at OLR,

565
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and it goes back to when we first got our first one-star reviews on iTunes and so forth,

566
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
when we're paying out of pocket to do this show, and it goes, Haters going to hate.

567
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
That's what they say.

568
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
At least they're not telling you to get back in the kitchen.

569
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
That's right. If you do something that is successful, and if this turns out to be successful,

570
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
there are going to be people who will just hate it just because it was successful too,

571
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
or that maybe they didn't think of it first, or that they would have done it a different way.

572
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
We'll accept that. This is going to be our story and the way that we want to tell it,

573
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and we hope people like it. If they don't, they don't need to watch it.

574
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
They don't need to buy it. They could bash it all they want,

575
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
but I feel like there's a good amount of people that do like this idea

576
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
and want to see what we're coming up with for it.

577
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
All right. Well, let me ask you one more question on a bit more of a positive note,

578
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
and then maybe if there's one or two more from Chad, I'll try to squeeze those in too.

579
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
What do you hope, on a more positive note, when people watch this movie

580
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and the credits roll fade to black, what feeling do you hope people walk away with

581
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
after viewing your movie?

582
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,000
That's a great question. I got a feeling that the vast majority of watchers

583
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
are going to be people like our age that grew up with the entire series.

584
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Those are the people that it's really designed for, and they're going to feel validated.

585
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
They're going to understand a little bit better this undefinable connection

586
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
they have with that franchise and why that one above all the other ones.

587
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Like you said, why not Metroid? Why not Kid Icarus? Why not even Super Mario Brothers?

588
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Why is there such an emotive connection to The Legend of Zelda?

589
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And I hope this helps them feel like they're in good company,

590
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
especially the people that aren't the super hardcore Zelda nerds out there

591
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
that are just kind of passive adults now.

592
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And they're looking back like, yeah, that really did inspire my life and why.

593
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And I'm hoping they leave with that.

594
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Awesome. Well, speaking of inspiration, Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

595
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I wonder if The Legend of Zelda has inspired people who work in the entertainment industry,

596
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
not in movies or television besides in gaming. Well, you work in movies.

597
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Well, no, we've got one Hollywood writer that is very much backing the project financially

598
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and has agreed to be in it.

599
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So he has requested that I not talk about that too much

600
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
because he's got another Kickstarter campaign going right now,

601
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
so he doesn't want to split.

602
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
But no, we actually have some people in Hollywood that we'll be talking to in the documentary.

603
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Like I said, the people that work at Rainfall that did that cool IGN trailer.

604
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Oh.

605
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So they're going to be in it.

606
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And also some gaming companies that are more prevalent in today's market.

607
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We actually have an artist that's a new artist at Blizzard

608
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
who's going to be chiming in about the direction of art and games and things like that.

609
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So yeah, absolutely, we're going to be talking to some people that are currently in the entertainment industry.

610
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
One more question here from YYR in our chatroom,

611
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and this one might be a little bit tricky, but it's fair based on Nintendo's actions in the past.

612
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
If you go forward with this and Nintendo gives you a cease and desist right before you release,

613
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
but all the money has been spent, what happens then?

614
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Is that of concern?

615
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah, I can't say it's a 0% threat, but we've done everything to minimize that.

616
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And like I said, the U.S. has some great fair use laws for documentary and filmmakers.

617
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
We're pretty well versed in those and having done documentaries in the past.

618
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And we've worked with a legal team for about six months before we even considered that this was a realistic project that we wanted to attempt doing.

619
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So we're really, really, really working hard to stay on the side of fair use.

620
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And like I said, in some cases that means we had to scrap some of the ideas.

621
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
But even if they tried to slap a cease and desist on us, which like I said, I hope that they had in full support of the project.

622
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But even if they tried, they really wouldn't have a lot of legal backing in the way that we're telling the story.

623
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So we're working really hard on that. I can never say it's a 0% possibility, but we're being very, very, very careful about that.

624
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The best that probably would be able to happen was they'd have to say that this scene and or that scene would have to be cut from the film.

625
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And aside from that, the film would be definitely still produced.

626
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Gotcha. Well, you know, when I think of a movie like King of Kong, which obviously everybody knows with documentary and gaming and Donkey Kong was a Nintendo game.

627
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And that movie happened.

628
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And that was filmed without Nintendo's consent, at least originally. I don't know if they ended up gaining it in retrospect.

629
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Everybody trying to beat that score.

630
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Not to mention all of the other footage of the Midway games.

631
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah, there were other things in that too.

632
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And I encourage anybody who's interested in doing projects like this to check out the fair use laws and see how they protect documentary filmmakers and things like that.

633
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
One of the scenes that's difficult is the scenes from the Symphony of the Goddesses.

634
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But we got full permission from the creators of Symphony of the Goddesses. We had great sit-down interviews with those guys.

635
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
We were able to film the orchestra. They told us that they have permission to extend permission up to two minutes of filming for us.

636
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So you could film and use two minutes of their footage in the course of the documentary.

637
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So, you know, there's things like that. Like, yeah, there's imagery shown on the big jumbotron behind the orchestra playing Zelda themes.

638
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But they were able to grant us permission to use it. There was just that stipulation.

639
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:42,000
So again, you know, the capturing of the imagery at that point was incidental. It was commentary on the music going from 8-bit chiptunes to full-on orchestration.

640
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And because it's commentary like that, if you really look into the fair use laws, you'll kind of see how that works a little bit better.

641
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And anybody who's interested in doing a project like this, I encourage doing that and really studying it and getting with somebody who knows entertainment law before you try and take it on.

642
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Well, Joe, you're very passionate about this project. I can hear it. I can tell that you're a long-time fan of gaming and so forth.

643
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And I really wish you the best of luck with this project and getting funded.

644
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Anything else you want to say? You want to tell the listeners one more time how to check out the project and what it's all about and consider funding?

645
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Sure. A couple more things I'd love to talk to you about if you can give me just a couple more minutes.

646
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
You got it.

647
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
If you guys go to www.TheZeldaMovie.com, if you're on a computer as opposed to a mobile device, there's a nice little 8-bit game that is the navigation for our site.

648
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It's kind of fun just to play through. A lot of people have. And you get to a windscreen and you get to see two extra minutes of the film.

649
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But yeah, if you check that out, that will also lead you. There's a link there to our Kickstarter, link there to our trailer.

650
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So www.TheZeldaMovie.com. And the only other thing I wanted to talk about that we haven't been able to show yet but we're finally able to sort of talk about.

651
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
The main way that we want to distribute this film, we're going to have more traditional channels.

652
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We've got a company that's working on digital distribution through online sources such as iTunes and we want to distribute Blu-ray and DVD and stuff.

653
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But the main way that I really want to distribute this is there's actually going to be a playable game which will be sort of metaphorical of the adventure through which you can sort of play through a non-linear version of the film and find different interviews and all kinds of bonus material.

654
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And we're going to try and make that available definitely for iOS devices, probably for Android and something that's a standalone Mac and PC game as well.

655
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And that's not going to be like the 8-bit game on the site. That's going to be a very unique digital experience inspired by the gameplay and mechanics of original Legend of Zelda games but resemble and look more of a contemporary modern video game.

656
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So we hope that that's the way most people watch it. That's how it's intended to be watched.

657
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Well that sounds like a cool little extra and I think I saw some rewards in the Kickstarter have to do with being a part of that game.

658
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That game or the 8-bit game that's going to be on the site for the duration of the film, yep.

659
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Nice, very nice. Well best of luck to you Joe in the project and thanks for sitting down with us today.

660
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You know I hear that our pal Bobby Blackwolf here at the Voice Geeks Network who did a story on this before might be in the movie.

661
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:20,000
He was actually out of one of our first filming experiences in Atlanta and we're going back up there in June and he's been a very strong proponent of the film which I appreciate.

662
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
That's awesome you know and it's great to know that as a fellow gamer and a fellow Zelda freak that he supports the project fully and absolutely so that's awesome.

663
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Alright well we support you too so best of luck to you Joe. Thanks for...

664
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Now where are you guys at in California?

665
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
We are in Sacramento, California.

666
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I love Sacramento man. When I get out there I'll make sure to look you guys up.

667
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That is amazing that you've actually heard of Sacramento because most people are like...

668
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I used to tour with a rock band. Sacramento was one of my favorite towns when we traveled.

669
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
We have a great support of the indie music community out here. This is where Warp 11 is from.

670
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Hey my friend's husband went to school with the lead singer and I used to work with their old drummer's girlfriend.

671
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Nice.

672
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So yeah.

673
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It's also a small town. Alright Joe you take care and thanks again for sitting down with us tonight and best of luck on your Kickstarter alright?

674
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Thanks guys.

675
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Alright you're welcome have a good one.

676
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Take care.

677
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
www.TheZeldaMovie.com for more information on It's Dangerous to Go Alone.

678
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Loki did you enjoy hearing what that guy had to say?

679
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Yeah. The only thing I was kind of combing through the rewards. A little disappointed to see that there's not a wooden sword as a reward.

680
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Like an actual sword.

681
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Like an actual wooden sword.

682
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I mean it would be that hard. You just take a couple two by fours and slap it together on me.

683
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Alright well maybe in the future you'll hear this back and think about adding something like that.

684
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
A little hard to ship you know.

685
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
That's true that's true and some people frown on sending weapons in the mail.

686
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Anyhow let's move on with other video gaming news tonight.

687
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:02,000
From Zelda and the great 8-bit games of yesteryear to a very modern Diablo 3 and the modern problems that come with a game like that.

688
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You know Blizzard put out a new patch 1.08 for Diablo 3 and there was a huge bug in the game.

689
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:16,000
It increased the stack size for in-game gold in the auction house from 1 million to 10 million making gold 10 times cheaper.

690
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And if you cancelled a gold auction you got refunded double the amount.

691
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Oops.

692
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So people were exploiting this left and right to generate trillions of gold.

693
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Isn't this the whole reason why Diablo 3 clung to this always online thing.

694
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's not about the DRM it's about the integrity in the auction house duh duh duh.

695
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And then they fucked it up with this bug.

696
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So why bother with always online.

697
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Well I guess that's maybe why the Playstation 4 and 3 ones are going to go a different route and not have to worry about that shit right.

698
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Hmm I don't know.

699
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Well if there is any possible silver lining to this.

700
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Blizzard in talking about the bug said that just 415 players all of which were sanctioned actually used the exploit.

701
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And the real money auction sales that were generated as a part of this all of the proceeds will be redirected to the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.

702
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:30,000
If you had a legitimate transaction you have nothing to worry about but if you were one of these 415 sellers that sold the excess gold guess who really got your money.

703
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Charity.

704
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You know I always hate that they always punish people that exploit bugs in games.

705
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Like if you're hacking that's one thing if you're exploiting like a bug or glitch that's kind of dumb.

706
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeah but you should have seen some of these people man.

707
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I saw somebody on or at least I saw a link to a clip from Justin TV where this guy was like I'm going to walk you through how to do this duh duh duh.

708
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And then he's like what are you going to do about it Blizzard come at me bro duh duh duh.

709
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And then of course they came at him.

710
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And but you know it's kind of like when I see that kind of cockiness and arrogance you're kind of like you're waiting for these guys to get the ban hammer and it's kind of hilarious.

711
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Come on look you got to admit like a guy like that kind of.

712
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm not necessarily talking about this situation I'm talking about like you know like Call of Duty for example.

713
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:24,000
They have it's stupid they consider like jumping up on certain like areas that you might not necessarily think about jumping up on a glitch.

714
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And so they patch that out and you can actually get like banned or you know short term banned for using these glitches in game.

715
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Like what the hell. It's a container that you can jump on.

716
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Why should that be a banable offense.

717
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Well it's just weird to me that somehow this really horrific bug was missed.

718
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I mean this is huge.

719
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I don't know it's just kind of goes to show that tying your game to online may not fix all your problems.

720
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It's weird that you know you might have a bug like that and then sometimes you may have a bug that causes your workers not to drive their cars to work.

721
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And said walk up a giant hill and lose their jobs because they're you know they're too far away from.

722
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Oh I have to be the Sims.

723
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
All right moving on.

724
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's why you just cheat and give yourself the motherlode code and buy a teleporter.

725
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I mean I don't do anything like that at all do I.

726
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But the whole point of at least the older Sims game.

727
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I'm not talking about New Sim City but all those cheat cheat cheat cheat.

728
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Everybody cheats in those games.

729
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
That's the fun of the game.

730
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
That's why this New Sim City was very like to me because it's always online.

731
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
How am I going to cheat.

732
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You know which I know they have their sandbox mode but it's not the same.

733
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:43,000
The fun of the Sims for me was pretty much building my house and then seeing getting all of the you know really dirty add ons that people would make.

734
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Prince Brightstar in chat an interesting comment it's a difference between single and multiplayer games.

735
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You know Diablo's auction house is very multiplayer but see that's where Diablo is in a weird place because a lot of people are like.

736
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I want to play Diablo as a single player game.

737
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,000
This is why I hated the online thing in the first place is that it wasn't never a multiplayer thing to me.

738
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:09,000
For me I think Diablo is more fun with more people but you know I respect those that don't want to play the game that way.

739
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Playing with other people is hell.

740
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Awesome.

741
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Because it reminds me of like.

742
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
What was it.

743
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
The.

744
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Oh crap.

745
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Now I can't remember the hell that.

746
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
The gauntlet.

747
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Got legends.

748
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Reminds me that it'd be cool to do like a Diablo arcade game like with four players at the same time and just.

749
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Oh yeah.

750
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Oh yeah.

751
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
The gauntlet legends was kind of that.

752
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I know.

753
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Anymore.

754
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It was amazing.

755
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Getting in 64.

756
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Dust it off.

757
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
All right.

758
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Anyhow let's move on.

759
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I can dig one up for you.

760
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Anyway there's a rumor going around and there was even a fake logo out on Reddit about this that the next Xbox was supposed to be called the Xbox Infinity.

761
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah.

762
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm sorry.

763
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Good.

764
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Well this is supposed to be a report from the International Business Times.

765
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And that there was also says to be floating around in rumor land about an Xbox TV video streaming set that was mentioned via Wall Street Journal.

766
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
But Microsoft is like we're not commenting on that because it's rumors and speculation.

767
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
And even if it's true we aren't telling you.

768
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:34,000
OK well the International Business Times thing is completely fake by the way because their source they said unnamed sources and they said read it right there is like OK.

769
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
That's not true.

770
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And yes it came out that the person actually created the Photoshop for that said nope that's not true.

771
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So yes unfortunately the exit will fortunately be Xbox infinity thing.

772
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Not true.

773
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:57,000
More likely is the fact fusion which would be you know something that would tie in with all the site registrations that they have for Xbox fusion or something like that.

774
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So some part of it still a dumb name whatever.

775
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
So yeah Xbox infinity.

776
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
That's just a ridiculous name because how do you go from there.

777
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I mean if you have plus one at any rate basically just talking about this for the sake of squashing the rumor mill.

778
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It's not true.

779
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Like getting your information from Reddit would be like me writing my term paper on Wikipedia.

780
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It could be correct but you don't know.

781
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You don't know who these people are.

782
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I solve crimes on Reddit.

783
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
No there's nothing wrong with getting some news from Reddit.

784
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
As long as you back as long as you can trace stuff leaks out.

785
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:41,000
It's fine if stuff leaks out but you have to have some sort of evidence that leaks a screen a picture on Reddit is not evidence.

786
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
That is like that's ridiculous.

787
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
To be fair I don't want to make it sound like we're dogging on Reddit.

788
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I love Reddit.

789
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I'm a user.

790
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I you know I post on things and so forth and it's been a great place to enrich the Warcraft podcast community has a great subreddit.

791
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,000
But you have to because Reddit is a part of the Internet.

792
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You have to be a little bit of a skeptic.

793
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
You have to be.

794
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I'm not saying it's just an extension of everything else in the end.

795
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Reddit's bad but it's just like saying you saw a screenshot on some random Web site.

796
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
If you have nothing that if you have no like sort of evidence to back that up.

797
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You know let's say you have actual sources.

798
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Now we know that the International Business Times has no fucking sources.

799
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Their sources are fucking some dude that's in their IT department or some intern.

800
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Hey I was on Reddit during a quote lunch unquote.

801
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Or examiner.com is almost all like user based.

802
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And Forbes is going that way too.

803
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
But here's the worst fucking part about that.

804
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
So they ran that story and they checked no sources or whatever.

805
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Nothing.

806
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And so they ran it.

807
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Then everybody else ran it.

808
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Everybody ran it.

809
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
It's like what the fuck.

810
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
First off these guys don't check their sources.

811
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Then you just don't check your sources either.

812
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
You're just as bad as they are.

813
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Oh there's a there's a lot of those journalists sites that they keep their tabs on.

814
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Another response.

815
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
So you may have seen us run this article about this.

816
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Well it was a clever photo shot.

817
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I was like come on man.

818
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Seriously you didn't even check anything.

819
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I thought you had sources that had information about things.

820
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
OK back when the whole beautiful Katamari thing happened to us right.

821
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
That was all dig which you know was kind of like the Reddit of five years ago right was dig.

822
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And you know when when our story got up voted and all that on dig because people were you know seeing it on our site.

823
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
That's when it really blew up and it was everywhere.

824
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And then you know he got got too far exposed.

825
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
But anyway.

826
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:57,000
But I'm saying that there's it's just they're not thinking if all these sites have sources though it just makes you wonder how legit these sources are if they're taking Reddit photos.

827
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I mean I'm not saying it's bad it's on Reddit but just like an anonymous screenshot on your website or something like that.

828
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
To be fair some of them credited it with due credit.

829
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Like I saw a run of this story on Ars Technica that said you know here's this story about Xbox infinity and then they ran it with the logo but the caption logo was here's how one Reddit user named imagine the logo to look you know and it was it was done right.

830
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
So.

831
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:33,000
All right. Anyhow I like the name Xbox infinity but that's about as far as I give this story anyway.

832
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Sorry we'll see me May 21st it is almost here for God's sake.

833
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Right now one more one more show full of this crap.

834
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
You know what I don't even care.

835
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I'm calling it the shit box.

836
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
We already let our listeners vote it's Xbox lube.

837
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Or that or I'm gonna like build a new litter box for my cat that looks like whatever the new Xbox is so she can poop in it.

838
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:14,000
All right. What you need to do I mean it's already it's begging for a Photoshop but you know Invader Zim had these alien race with the amazing fusion technology and it's basically duct taping shit together so you know I fused this phone with a hamster.

839
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
They already did that with two game cubes.

840
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Not duct tape. I've known people who have held computers together via duct tape and I saw a car that seemed to be held together by nothing but duct tape and chicken wire last time I was in Alabama.

841
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I kid you not the whole door.

842
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Prince bright star chat says name speculation has always been a part of new console launches remember the Nintendo on. I do and I remember when they were just going to call it Nintendo or revolution remember that.

843
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Well technically it was called revolution it was their code name for that but you know just like dolphin and drango seven dolphin dolphin.

844
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Just a commercial.

845
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And then Tyra bank screaming and running.

846
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:14,000
You know we're talking about the midness new litter box being an Xbox lube. The thing is is that if we got one of those Dan would put it on the shelf and Midna would try to take over and sit on it because that's what she does with our current Xbox.

847
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:23,000
That's what video game systems are there cat warmers have a black shelf and a black Xbox and my black cat sits right next to the Xbox when she's trying to blend in and hide from people.

848
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It is the funniest thing because you where's cat where's cat where's cat green eyes there's a cat knows the Xbox is just on fusing with the Xbox.

849
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Nice. All right. Let's move on.

850
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:52,000
All right. So there's yet another rumor about a set tops box version of the next Xbox and you know it kind of goes back to the rumors where they were saying that you know there's going to be two different types of Xbox systems there's going to be one that's kind of like a Apple TV or you know something that's basically connected to the Internet always.

851
01:03:52,000 --> 01:04:03,000
But it has no actual media media drives or anything like that. It's mainly meant for like streaming and you know Xbox Live arcade and that kind of sort of thing serves that.

852
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And this is actually coming from I guess an anonymous source that told the Wall Street Journal that this Xbox TV thing is in the works and I guess we'll have to wait until the 21st to see if that's actually going to happen.

853
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I think we've been hearing a lot of rumors about it. It would make sense if they did something like that because I mean the new focus of the system aside from playing games is going to be kind of integrating with the you know your TV watching you know they want to have their own content.

854
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It's a big thing you know for people that don't necessarily game on the Xbox you know or if you are gaming on the Xbox the other half of your time is probably watching Netflix or Hulu or something like that.

855
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
So it would make sense that they're trying to integrate it even more.

856
01:04:51,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Every Xbox though that's come out they've had this advertisement for linking your TV shows and doing you know making it a hub for all of your entertainment it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being accurate.

857
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I don't mind the way they've got it right now but I don't like having to launch separate programs for everything. I just kind of want it as like channels almost if that makes sense.

858
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:31,000
You know just like OK I need to watch you know or kind of like how they do it I guess on the Wii U with the TV is you know OK I want to watch The Simpsons or something and then it's like OK The Simpsons are on Netflix on Hulu and on Fox right now.

859
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Or on you know Amazon and you can pick where you want to stream that shit from instead of having to figure out OK well I got to go on Hulu.

860
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Oh shit it's not here. Oh I got to go on Netflix. Oh it's not here. Oh I got to go here. You know it'll show you where it's at and where you can find it or if it's on TV right there or you can maybe go one step further and say OK I want DVR that.

861
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Did they integrate Netflix into TV finally.

862
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I think that was the first thing that they integrated.

863
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
No it wasn't there at first it was they had Amazon was in there at first.

864
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I think was the first I know it's I think it's on there because it's that and then Amazon.

865
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I actually used my Wii U for Netflix last night but I didn't do it through TV I just was in the Wii U.

866
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:23,000
So I'm going to our chat room at live dot vog network dot com Rama says Xbox TV just like Apple TV but cheaper and less uppity.

867
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Hey well it might not be cheaper either.

868
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Apple TV is pretty fun and cheap. Ninety nine bucks now.

869
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
You know what though you can just have a computer.

870
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah build a ninety nine dollar computer.

871
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Or just get somebody's old PC that they're not using or get one at a thrift store as long as it'll go online it works.

872
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
It's just not sexy though.

873
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Mine's pretty sexy.

874
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Bobby Blackwell in our chat room confirming yes they did with the integration with Netflix on TV.

875
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
They've also recently integrated Hulu Plus and I'm pretty sure on that last one at least.

876
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah I just had to look it up because we're having a seminar this week about video streaming and what it means for our business.

877
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Basically a bunch of people going to be saying oh it's so difficult don't worry don't worry you can still sell movies.

878
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
All right well moving on to back to games.

879
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,000
A big merger happened in the gaming world this week exceed the games who made what Pandora's Tower.

880
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,000
They made other a few other games to like a lot of cult like didn't they do the last story and they did the last story.

881
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
They brought all those rainfall games over.

882
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Yeah everything except for the first one.

883
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Oh the Xenoblade yeah.

884
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Well Exceed purchased Atlas Online and Atlas of course did what like Disgaea.

885
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Don't they publish that and you know they they do a lot of those publishings.

886
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I think Atlas Online is a separate entity from.

887
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Oh derp derp.

888
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Well good I'm glad you clarified that but Atlas Online.

889
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Promise of wild arms.

890
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Atlas Online has been purchased from or has been purchased by Exceed games and they've now formed a new name.

891
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So you're not going to hear this anymore you're going to hear Marvelous USA.

892
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
They will be based in Irvine and it's going to be all the employees from the former Exceed game teams.

893
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And with Atlas Online I see because it's going to be about enhancing mobile and online game markets.

894
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So it's kind of more about rounding themselves out so that probably you could see like a Pandora's Tower like iPhone game and so forth.

895
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
This has nothing to do with this guy.

896
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
They've got.

897
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Was it killer is dead is their next big kind of multi platform release.

898
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
All right well very cool.

899
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:46,000
You know it's not like you know these are these are two kind of smaller ish companies joining together to try and step it up and compete more with the big guys like EA and so forth.

900
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
So this kind of neat.

901
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Yeah it doesn't sound like there was job loss that came out of it.

902
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
So great.

903
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
All right let's move on.

904
01:08:53,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Well in other news we have well some very interesting news coming out of for EA.

905
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:12,000
They have a FIFA exclusive license until 2022 which I guess they're not hurting all that much if they're getting the FIFA games.

906
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That's including the FIFA World Cup game and everything under EA Sports for the FIFA branding.

907
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Also now and this is the kicker I would say is that Disney is giving EA a Star Wars game agreement exclusive licensing for all of the Star Wars characters and storylines.

908
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:43,000
EA is going to develop and publish the new titles for a quote core gaming audience over.

909
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
See all interactive platforms and the most popular game genres.

910
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Disney is retaining the rights to develop new titles with mobile social tablet and online gaming.

911
01:09:51,000 --> 01:10:00,000
So Disney thank you for killing the Star Wars franchise by putting it in EA's hands.

912
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,000
You know and they're going to rush everything out and give us shitty endings and change the writing halfway through the story.

913
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I don't think it's a bad thing actually because look at some of the look at the game to everyone wants Star Wars battlefront to publish the last three or three whatever it wants equal to two.

914
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So look who published the last one I mean I think it was EA under you know they published it for LucasArts if I remember correctly.

915
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So that's not so bad.

916
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Well was it just me or when you guys read the news about this this week did you just suddenly hear this in your head.

917
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
You know what.

918
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
You might laugh.

919
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
EA owns your ass right now.

920
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Coming to wreck all your favorite games.

921
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Hey I look forward to Star Wars FIFA soccer.

922
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
You know what I was going to use this as my wedding march.

923
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Had we not gone to the courthouse.

924
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
You were literally you were going to literally walk down the aisle to this.

925
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I was.

926
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
You know what I was going to walk down the aisle to.

927
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Tara walked down to Doctor Who stuff because she walked down to the Star Trek The Next Generation opening.

928
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Now I know it sounds weird to hear me talking about walking down the aisle but you have to realize in a gay wedding it'll be a little bit different.

929
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:33,000
But I already have my song picked out.

930
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
You guys miss Alan in the background.

931
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Alan just like with impeccable common timing just walked by and went nope.

932
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
That was Abba's I do I do I do just in case you didn't.

933
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I imagine most of our audience probably didn't catch the reference but that was it.

934
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Oh come on. It's you. They know you and your love of Abba.

935
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I just wish that we had a webcam on when you were playing just dance Abba.

936
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And I'm glad we didn't. That was the funniest thing I've ever seen.

937
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I really had to walk down the aisle to the song week.

938
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I don't remember. I remember your ass.

939
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
You should remember the D.J. that was absolutely terrible.

940
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
When you walked out.

941
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
OK. Not the aisle but when you were introduced.

942
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Yeah yeah yeah. No no no.

943
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:25,000
When we first walked out when we walked in the aisle it was supposed to be I think it was supposed to be a sunrise sunset.

944
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I think was supposed to be what they're going to be. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

945
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And then it ended up being like week or something.

946
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I'm like the hell are you playing.

947
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Nice that you're at say that your wedding was pretty fun.

948
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And I will say that Chris that Chris Brown song that you have that everybody dancing to that's band.

949
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
You will not hear that. You will not hear that goddamn song at my wedding.

950
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So all right. Anyway.

951
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Rama in chat says Rob Roberts is going to walk down the aisle to its reigning men or something by the Spice Girls.

952
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
How gay do you think I am. No Spice Girls.

953
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That's totally you. I mean then again I am talking about walking down to Abba but that's different.

954
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
That's classic. Abba is classic. That's right.

955
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
But Spice Girls is getting pretty classic. I'll tell you what you if you want to class it up a bit.

956
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Get lucky. You just need to get lucky.

957
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It's not even really walking out. It's more strutting.

958
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I'll just I'll just I'll walk down to the music from Tron.

959
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
No no no no no. The game has changed.

960
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
You have to you have to do you have to do that.

961
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
You have to do the Wendy Carlos Tron soundtrack. Oh no no no.

962
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And we'll have blue lights everywhere. All right.

963
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Anyway somehow we went from Star Wars to weddings.

964
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
But all right. So Loki doesn't think this is such a big deal.

965
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
You know what. The Star Wars games lately have been so bad.

966
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
What was really what was the last time there was a good Star Wars game.

967
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Super Star Wars. Granted the Old Republic. I didn't hate it.

968
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I just think it was a better single player game.

969
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And some of the MMO aspects didn't work out so well and kind of flopsied.

970
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
But like I can't stop thinking about that Star Wars connect game.

971
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It was so bad. Okay well that was really terrible.

972
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:17,000
What about before that the force unleashed. I think some people like the first one.

973
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
That was supposed to be all right. Oh Alan's here.

974
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Are you going to are you going to comment further on the music choices Alan.

975
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
No just Star Wars games.

976
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Force Unleashed I thought was pretty good even if the first one wasn't quite finished.

977
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And Jedi Academy. Jedi Academy 2. I love that game. I'd love to see a third one.

978
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I remember Dan playing through Rogue Squadron and that seemed pretty neat.

979
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
No more no more Star Wars characters in Soul Calibur though you can bet that.

980
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
That's that's done. All right.

981
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
You know what. That was a mistake.

982
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I liked it. Star Killer was an awesome character.

983
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Not so much the Yoda invader that was what the Star Killer made a great character in Soul Calibur.

984
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
But anyway.

985
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Maybe we'll get another Marvel fighting game from EA.

986
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
All right let's travel around the world. Look those Star Wars games what they're not.

987
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
They said none of them in fiscal 2014. So it's going to be a while before you see these games.

988
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
So for now let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming a little bit sooner.

989
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,000
This week there's only one game coming out and that would be Metro Last Light.

990
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And that's on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC.

991
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on bognetwork.com

992
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
use the passphrase damage.

993
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Well that was short.

994
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Yep. We've had a lot of weeks of just like nothing lately.

995
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
It'll pick up a little. Everyone's sleeping.

996
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Especially with summer coming up you would think.

997
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I wish I was sleeping right now.

998
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I'm usually dead though.

999
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Well they're usually like a bunch like late May early June like right when the kids get a bunch late in June.

1000
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
But it's not the case this year.

1001
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Interesting traveling over to Japan and checking out what is coming out over there.

1002
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I know we've talked about this series before a love alternative total eclipse on PlayStation 3.

1003
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I know we've talked about this before. Isn't it like an anime or something.

1004
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
We finally figured out is what it's about. I thought it was like a girl groping game or something.

1005
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It sounds like it sure looks like it when you see pictures like that where they don't show the guy's face.

1006
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
You know it's porn. There's some love going on.

1007
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
And then Mac warriors. I remember this. It's like based on an anime or something.

1008
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I think somebody had to educate us on this. That's all the animes.

1009
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
You know what like scantily clad women and Macs.

1010
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
That's all the games in Japan that don't come out over here.

1011
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And honestly I have no problem with that.

1012
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I mean because that's pretty awesome.

1013
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Macs are awesome. Women are awesome.

1014
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Bob Coffee in chat says it's a visual novel.

1015
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Visual novel is not so awesome.

1016
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Stop.

1017
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
On the Xbox 360 also Muv Luv is there as well.

1018
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
By the way that's a regular limited edition and Famitsu deluxe pack.

1019
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I'm assuming Famitsu is going to give it a 40 right.

1020
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
No probably not.

1021
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Moving on to the PlayStation Vita.

1022
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Nothing this week but there will be a new blaze blue pretty soon.

1023
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Or is that a price reduction.

1024
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Oh sorry that's a price reduction.

1025
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Why can't we get any more Tokimeki.

1026
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
You know good old fashioned dating sims.

1027
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
You should write your congress person.

1028
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
They have visual novels coming out from axis games.

1029
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It's more of the I don't remember which series it is now.

1030
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
But they've done a couple on PSP and they keep putting them out on PSP.

1031
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Rama from our friends at Anime Jam Session.

1032
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Tuesdays on VoG says Loki you shut your whore mouth.

1033
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Not all anime is boobs and ass.

1034
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
All the good ones though.

1035
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Hey.

1036
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Hey there's lots of good anime out there that isn't boobs and ass.

1037
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Like Pokemon. Pokemon.

1038
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I didn't say it was all boobs and ass. I said it was boobs and ass and mechs.

1039
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I was about to say Macross but yeah there's some of that there too.

1040
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Alright on the Wii U this week nothing.

1041
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
But Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is soon.

1042
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
That would of course be Resident Evil over here.

1043
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
On the 3DS this week G1 Grand Prix gets a price reduction.

1044
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And that's really it on the 3DS this week.

1045
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Lastly taking a look at one more console here.

1046
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
The PSP because there's still some things trickling through over there.

1047
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Summon Knight 5 comes out this week from Namco Bandai.

1048
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Or as they call it over there Bandai Damco.

1049
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
So there you go.

1050
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
That looks neat.

1051
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It looks like another little chibi.

1052
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
It looks like a strategy RPG thing.

1053
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Like a tactics style game.

1054
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Never mind.

1055
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Well how about the UK?

1056
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Yes how about it?

1057
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
They have crumpets. No I'm kidding.

1058
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Well yeah they do but still.

1059
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
On the 14th of May we have Dust 514.

1060
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
On the 15th we have Sanctum 2 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360.

1061
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,000
On the 16th Frozen sign ups for iPad and the Starship Domre on 3DS.

1062
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And on the 17th Metro Last Delight for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC.

1063
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
And that is all.

1064
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Alright just a couple more news stories for you guys.

1065
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
And then the classic game of the week.

1066
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
But first Loki.

1067
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Alright.

1068
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So Silicon Knights.

1069
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,000
You may remember them for 2Human and a bunch of other games.

1070
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I remember them for 2Human.

1071
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Well they have closed their doors or closed their offices.

1072
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,000
They have emptied out their offices and unloaded some of their properties.

1073
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
In fact unloading some assets from Eternal Darkness I want to believe.

1074
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
To the Shadows of the Eternal Kickstarter there.

1075
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
So they've actually got assets now for their new game.

1076
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And they are still arguing with Epic Games over 2Humans still if you can believe that.

1077
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I mean how long ago? 2008?

1078
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I mean jeez.

1079
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Give it up already. You haven't won yet.

1080
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Oh 5 whole years ago. No. Yeah. 5 whole years ago.

1081
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
They're still fighting them even though I remember the last thing.

1082
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I want to say the last settlement. The judgment was that they owed even more or something now.

1083
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I don't remember.

1084
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Yeah. 4.45 million going to Epic Games.

1085
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And still they're fighting it.

1086
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Gosh. I don't know.

1087
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I don't think we're going to see any more games from Silicon Knights.

1088
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Yeah. I think it's safe to say you probably are not going to see anything else from them.

1089
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
But you will see some new games possibly on a new game console.

1090
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
It's a mobile game TV console. It's called Game Pop.

1091
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
This is being made by Bluestacks.

1092
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
And you can play mobile games on your TV with this little device using the controller.

1093
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
An iPhone or an Android smartphone.

1094
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
But here's where it's different than say the Ouya.

1095
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Which is probably the first thing that pops into your mind which is very similar.

1096
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Something like Game Stick.

1097
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
The subscription model is like Netflix here.

1098
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,000
For $7 a month you get the entire Game Pop library.

1099
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
That's 500 games right now.

1100
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Now how many of those are actually good games? Who knows?

1101
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
But out of 500 there's got to be at least a few.

1102
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
So it's more the... What's the streaming?

1103
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Game Tap.

1104
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Yeah. Game Tap. Or what was the other one that is the streaming stuff just a few years ago?

1105
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
On Life.

1106
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Yeah. The On Life model.

1107
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So anyway. Yeah. Very interesting.

1108
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Also if you pre-order the console this month you get it for free.

1109
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
As long as you are doing a paid subscription to the service.

1110
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
There is no commitment or contract.

1111
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:39,000
The only little catch is that you have to return the console if you cancel your service within one year.

1112
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,000
But as long as you're willing to do what? 12 payments of $7.

1113
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
You would get a year's worth of games in the console.

1114
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
But again they're mobile games on your TV.

1115
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And it's something that you need to have a mobile phone to...

1116
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Or basically you have to download an app on your device to play.

1117
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
No since there's a controller. Or you can use iPhone or Android.

1118
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Really?

1119
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Yeah since there's your controller.

1120
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
That's what I was a little confused on because they actually in their trailer they don't actually show a controller.

1121
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
They just show you have to download the app and use your phone as the controller.

1122
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,000
In fact actually I don't think there is a controller because it basically what it does is it changes your phone into a controller.

1123
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
It's almost like a second screen if you will.

1124
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
But that's the only thing that seems kind of unappealing to me.

1125
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Because if you really want to do that.

1126
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
And I know that you can say the same argument about the Ouya and stuff.

1127
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:35,000
But you can get like an HDMI cable for your phone for like less than 30 bucks.

1128
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And plug your phone into your TV.

1129
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
But there's the whole fact that you get 500 games.

1130
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Now act deft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1131
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
It says Action 52 had 52 games in it and how many of those were good?

1132
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Well but one of them was in Angry Birds.

1133
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,000
There might be a couple gems amongst I'm sure a lot of throw away games here.

1134
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
But you know there might be some good stuff.

1135
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
It's an interesting idea.

1136
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Do you think we're not that far away from Xbox or Playstation?

1137
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Well hell Playstation Plus is kind of like this.

1138
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:19,000
It's been saying already that the Xbox 360 or the new Xbox is going to be focusing a lot on free to play stuff.

1139
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Probably because it makes sense.

1140
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Because if it's free to play you can avoid piracy because who cares.

1141
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Pirate it, more copies are out there and you make all your money in DLC.

1142
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I don't know.

1143
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
It's alright if they don't make it ridiculous.

1144
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
You know what I mean?

1145
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Alright well let's take a trip back in time to a time when you know you didn't have any of this subscription fees to play a game or anything like that.

1146
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Unless you had to tell of you.

1147
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I guess but I think this game might go before that.

1148
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I don't know.

1149
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
No this game is well after that.

1150
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Oh okay.

1151
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Well we're going to take a trip back in time then just a little bit to a classic video game the Dark Sakura has picked for us.

1152
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:07,000
She's jumped into the vault and said hey ungrateful kids play this game this week and respect gaming.

1153
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week?

1154
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I picked the Neon Genesis Evangelion game for Nintendo 64.

1155
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:20,000
It actually out of all of those games that's come out like the Saturn games and the other ones.

1156
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
This one has to probably be my favorite.

1157
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:30,000
It was really fun as far as it going through the entire series with the various battles and everything.

1158
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:39,000
It was based pretty directly on the TV series and actually went into events for End of Evangelion.

1159
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:48,000
So you had 13 missions that were basically focused on each of the angels going up to the...

1160
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
In fact this scene that I've linked here is the mission 12 where you go against the Eva series.

1161
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
And then at 13 are the other...

1162
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Yeah I went up through 13 levels.

1163
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:07,000
So basically this is just a retelling of the series but it's one that you participate in.

1164
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,000
You play as the various pilots in the game.

1165
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:19,000
There's even like this one right here is probably my favorite part in the entire series where Asuka gets her big I'm going to kick everybody's ass moment.

1166
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Oh wait I'm no longer in a coma.

1167
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
It was really really freaking well done for something on the Nintendo 64 I just had to say.

1168
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:33,000
So really there's not that much to say about it.

1169
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It's that you basically control the weapons as they go.

1170
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:47,000
You have cinematic attacks, you have actions, you have a different type of game plan that goes through.

1171
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
You're sort of in a 3D, 2D course where you can walk back and forth.

1172
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:57,000
But it pretty much has to do with just pressing the right commands to do the cinematic attacks.

1173
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I mean that's really the basis of it.

1174
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And then in the end you have like a free for all.

1175
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
You're still in that 3D, 2D sort of movement you can move more freely.

1176
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And that's used in missions 12 through 13.

1177
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You also have parts that are outside the missions like a training mode that's called simulation.

1178
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,000
You have different models that you can view.

1179
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
You've got your story mode so you're actually playing through the events and the stories.

1180
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And really there's actually also a versus mode too where you can do two player Eva versus Eva mode.

1181
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
And it's really just simple.

1182
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
It's freaking Evangelion you're playing the episodes.

1183
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
And this one to me was the best of them.

1184
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Just because it had more of that action element to it and less of the whole, as I was calling the Saturn ones, dates of Evangelion.

1185
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It's just good, good game.

1186
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,000
It was the best of the lot and I think that for anyone who's a fan of the series you should definitely give it a try.

1187
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
For a Nintendo 64 game it looks really good too.

1188
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
It does.

1189
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:17,000
If I remember correctly this is one of the games that was released during the later part of the Nintendo 64's life.

1190
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Because I remember I think that I first played this when I had a Dreamcast.

1191
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I know that one of my friends bought this and that's how I played it.

1192
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
But this is on my list of things to eventually pick up.

1193
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
It was a really, really fun game.

1194
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I mean really since it's Nintendo 64 I'm throwing it on the list because I really can't say enough good things about it.

1195
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It may seem kind of dated now but for its day it was pretty nice graphics and really good gameplay.

1196
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
It was very solid.

1197
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
That's it.

1198
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Alright there it is your Classic Eve of the Week for the Nintendo 64 Neon Genesis Evangelion.

1199
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Awesome.

1200
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Neat pick because I don't know much about that series at all but watching that YouTube I was like oh this looks kind of fun.

1201
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Alright we're going to take a quick break but when we come back there is plenty more news to come.

1202
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
The Frugal Question of the Week all about Zelda in the spirit of our interview earlier tonight.

1203
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Your emails and plenty more.

1204
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Your calls too when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio Episode 504 right after this.

1205
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Hey everyone I'm DJ Ronda S.

1206
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I'm Ari Rockefeller.

1207
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
And I'm Mako-Chan with Anime Jam Session.

1208
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio.

1209
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
The show where every gamer has a voice.

1210
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:47,000
And I want to use my voice to tell you that I like video games because I can kill people and not have to worry about going to prison.

1211
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Wow I always use my voice to tell you that Final Fantasy 7 is the greatest Final Fantasy game of all time and is not overrated.

1212
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Oh boy.

1213
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I want to use my voice to tell you that I would pay all my money for a Capcom fighting game crossover where no one bitches about to line up making dream candy.

1214
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Never happened.

1215
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I know but I do like that.

1216
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Good idea.

1217
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Can we go get food now?

1218
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Fuck yes I'm hungry.

1219
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Yeah I kind of want the pink berry.

1220
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Mmm pink berry.

1221
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Alright just got here.

1222
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Peace.

1223
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
See ya.

1224
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Alright.

1225
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Episode number 504 in progress.

1226
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
I want pink berry now.

1227
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Loki wants to use his voice to tell you that animes with boobies are better.

1228
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I want pink berry now.

1229
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Everything with boobies is better.

1230
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Um you know I can actually imagine a few things that putting boobs on would make it absolutely not better.

1231
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Could you imagine boobs with boobs?

1232
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
That would be frightening.

1233
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Double boobs?

1234
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
No no no no just boobs that have boobs.

1235
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Wouldn't that just be like a cow or something?

1236
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I don't know.

1237
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
No.

1238
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
That would be torpedo breasts.

1239
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
No.

1240
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Alright look you guys are awkward.

1241
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Alright um I forgot to mention this during my gaming week but I should mention this device that's sitting on our studio table now.

1242
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I got an IK this week which thanks to Dark Soccer I was saying something about it on Facebook that it was on sale.

1243
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Did you get Blazing Star? Did you did you did you did you?

1244
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
No but I.

1245
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Why not?

1246
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Well because I have I may or may not have a MAME emulator on the iPad and so I was playing Mega Man the Power Battle this week.

1247
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
It's kinda awesome just saying.

1248
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
You know what?

1249
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
What?

1250
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Ugh.

1251
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I will check that out as well too but uh yeah I was having and I don't want to hear it about the whole like you shouldn't support MAME and piracy and all that.

1252
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I I bought every single stinking Capcom arcade bundle pack and every freaking.

1253
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
You supported Game Room.

1254
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Yeah I did look.

1255
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Yeah exactly.

1256
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I bought I eat up all that retro shit when they put it out so.

1257
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Totally totally totally.

1258
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
The the Metal Slug games are actually super fun.

1259
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Oh yeah I bet.

1260
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
With the IKd but Blazing Star.

1261
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I told you how to get it to work right?

1262
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
You start the game then you leave the game and go back into it and then the IKd will work with it.

1263
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Oh.

1264
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
It won't right when you start up.

1265
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Well you know what else I have on there?

1266
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I have a Rygar which is awesome obviously the arcade version and I was I actually had it working once I think I think I took it out but I had Beatmania on there at one point.

1267
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Like the old school one yeah Beatmania you can do on there.

1268
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
But the thing is I can't figure out how to map the buttons.

1269
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Yet so I'm kind of stuck with the default configuration so if I wanted to play Beatmania on that it would kind of suck.

1270
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
You should use the make your joystick or scratch.

1271
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Yeah.

1272
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Just flick it with your hand.

1273
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
It shouldn't be that hard if it means but you know I think it's just one two three four five.

1274
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Yeah I think so.

1275
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
So.

1276
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Alright well anyway we're going to get back into some news here rapid fire news.

1277
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
So Loki.

1278
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Alright so let's talk a little bit about the Sims.

1279
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Well actually SimCity.

1280
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:05,000
SimCity is getting a 3.0 update this week and is attempting to fix the traffic problem again.

1281
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Because if you remember 2.0 kind of made some more problems.

1282
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:15,000
So they're trying to fix that and so we'll have to see later this week.

1283
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
She makes for some interesting reads.

1284
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Also they announced The Sims 4.

1285
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:31,000
It's going to be coming next year on PC and it is going to be offline and single player.

1286
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
They made sure to mention that.

1287
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:41,000
And last but not least you may remember you know such wonderful games getting rebooted.

1288
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Like well Duke Nukem Forever Maybe is not a good example but Rise of the Triad.

1289
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Well now Shadow Warrior getting redone by Flying Wild Hog.

1290
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,000
They're the developer and it's supposed to be published by Devolver Digital.

1291
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Which you know has done all sorts of awesome things so.

1292
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I kind of you know I almost forgot a little bit of Shadow Warrior.

1293
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I love Shadow Warrior because you know it had a slightly better version of the build engine.

1294
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
So you could do like upstairs and downstairs.

1295
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Because remember the build engine you couldn't really like create rooms.

1296
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Like if you had an elevator or something like that.

1297
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
You had to create like a teleporter that would teleport you to different room.

1298
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
It was the limitations of the engine so.

1299
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Looks cool I can't wait.

1300
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Going back to the SimCity stories for a minute here at our chat room.

1301
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster says great another traffic fix.

1302
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Haven't they had to fix the traffic in like every single patch they're doing something to it?

1303
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Yeah they have and it just hasn't worked.

1304
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Well you know traffic is a serious problem.

1305
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
It's not you know if you can fix traffic that easy LA would have it figured out by now.

1306
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Well remember the last time they tried it the last patch like fucked up sewage or something like that.

1307
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I'm sure it'll get taken apart once they put it out.

1308
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Also forgot to mention that SimCity has reached 1.6 million in sales.

1309
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
50% of that were online so.

1310
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
That's not surprising I think.

1311
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Considering if you think about considering that you know.

1312
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I don't know a lot of people purchase PC games online nowadays.

1313
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Speaking of traffic just totally random aside question I heard this on the radio the other day.

1314
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Obviously LA is the worst city in the nation for traffic but do you know what the number two city in the nation is?

1315
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Atlanta Georgia.

1316
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It is not Atlanta Georgia.

1317
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Have you ever been in Atlanta driving?

1318
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I'm telling you it was not ranked number it might have been number three I don't know but it was not number two.

1319
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And it was not it was not Sacramento and it's not San Francisco on game day.

1320
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Nope it's not San Francisco either.

1321
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Honolulu second worst city for traffic.

1322
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Which is interesting but I guess when you think it's kind of all by itself out there.

1323
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
And if they didn't build it right the first time there's not a lot of other places to build.

1324
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Makes sense.

1325
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Alright anyhow.

1326
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Actually I do have to agree with Prince Brightstar Boston is pretty bad.

1327
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Boston is very bad.

1328
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Seriously Atlanta is the worst traffic I have ever been in.

1329
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Bobby is Atlanta the worst yes or no?

1330
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
No it's really bad.

1331
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
It's really really bad.

1332
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Alright.

1333
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Let me move on to some Nintendo focused stories here.

1334
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
First one is about Super Mario RPG.

1335
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Super Mario RPG is going to be a reward for Club Nintendo members.

1336
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
You can get that on the Wii Virtual Console.

1337
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000
For 200 coins if you are a Club Nintendo member.

1338
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
That's on the Wii Virtual Console not Wii U.

1339
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
You can also get Maboshi's Arcade for WiiWare for 150.

1340
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
3D Classics Excitebike for 150. Wasn't that free at one point?

1341
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
ArtStyle Aquia for 100 coins.

1342
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
That's on DSiWare on the 3DS.

1343
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000
That's a cool game that I really wish would have a sequel.

1344
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Mario RPG?

1345
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Oh yeah absolutely.

1346
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
You might have 150 extra coins to spare if you purchase Super Metroid using coins.

1347
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Nintendo in a very interesting move decided to refund people who bought Super Metroid using 150 coins.

1348
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Because of the 30 cent promotion coming up on Wii U they decided to refund the coins.

1349
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
How kind.

1350
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
That is actually a very nice thing to do because I would have thought people should have been smarter and known that that was coming.

1351
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
But that's pretty cool.

1352
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Good on you Nintendo.

1353
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
And now you can use the coins to go buy a game that's almost as good as Super Metroid but not quite.

1354
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Because Super Metroid remember is greater than your favorite.

1355
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Alright and lastly when it comes to E3 this is really no surprise at all.

1356
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Reggie Fils-Aime and Shigeru Miyamoto are going to be hosting the pre-E3 presentation.

1357
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I mean duh right? Like those are the big personalities at Nintendo.

1358
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
The biggest shock is that they say presentation.

1359
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Not a million presentations.

1360
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Well but there could still be future ones done by others.

1361
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I mean it's not always just the two of them in the videos.

1362
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I've seen plenty of other people in there.

1363
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Including one J.C. who I knew back in the DDR days.

1364
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:18,000
They may have one before E3 and then a million during and after.

1365
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Okay I see I see.

1366
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
A custom tailored Nintendo Direct.

1367
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Alright.

1368
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:29,000
The presentation will be to selected media and it's going to take place before the show floor opens to the public.

1369
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Once the presentation is over members of the press gets to test out the titles before anyone else.

1370
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
That's what they're doing.

1371
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
They've already announced that was what they were doing.

1372
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
But I'm saying that Reggie Fils-Aime and Miyamoto are hosting it.

1373
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Well cool.

1374
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Which is no surprise I'm sure.

1375
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I'm sure his body is ready.

1376
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I wish I could get in. Me too. I want my body to be ready.

1377
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Alright Dark Sakura.

1378
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Sorry I was complaining about Florida cops.

1379
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Apologies to any of our listeners who is a cop in Florida. I know you are not all assholes.

1380
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Okay.

1381
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:08,000
So coming to the 3DS eShop is a Sonic Hedgehog.

1382
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Which is good news for everybody who is interested in playing that on your 3DS.

1383
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:21,000
It's actually even got the Genesis model 2 audio.

1384
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Which you can listen to as well.

1385
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
And there's also and this makes me pretty happy.

1386
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Dou Dompachi Saitai Ojo will be out for 360 and it will be region free.

1387
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
So I can import the shit out of that.

1388
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I mean basically since it's pretty much not being localized you can just import it.

1389
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
And that makes me super happy because I love Dou Dompachi.

1390
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:53,000
And then last but not least GameStop is not going to be taking PS2 trade-ins anymore.

1391
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Even though they will still be selling the games.

1392
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:03,000
As of June 1st they will not accept the console or related products for trade.

1393
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Assholes.

1394
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
They're very excited about the PS4.

1395
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Let's be real though. I mean it's not so much that they're assholes.

1396
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
They just need the shelf space.

1397
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
But not because of this.

1398
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,000
No. I think that they're missing out on a market.

1399
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Or they're going to be closing off an area of revenue.

1400
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
But I think they're... I don't know. I just don't think it's very wise.

1401
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Well the flea markets will pick it up and the other retro game stores.

1402
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Like fair game and game trader.

1403
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Fair game is local in Sacramento but they are really awesome.

1404
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
The one up the street here closed.

1405
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Even though you can still look inside it on the Google Maps thing which is creepy.

1406
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Funny.

1407
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Super creepy.

1408
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Which makes me wonder how old most of those pictures are.

1409
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Go figure.

1410
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Alright. Well if that does it for Dark Sakura's rapid fire news.

1411
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
So we're going to go to the foogle question of the week.

1412
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I rapid fired that.

1413
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
That's not the right theme song. What are you doing wrong with it?

1414
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Geez rap.

1415
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Facebook.com or Google Plus.

1416
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Slam those words together you get foogle plus.

1417
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
But it's foogle.

1418
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Tonight on foogle.

1419
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
We plugged the interview we had in our first half with Joe.

1420
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
The creator of it's dangerous to go alone the movie.

1421
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
And we thought since this was a documentary all about the Legend of Zelda.

1422
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
We're going to ask our listeners this week.

1423
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
What's your favorite memory of the Legend of Zelda series?

1424
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
This could be something that happened in the game.

1425
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Or a memory you have about playing it.

1426
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
We want to leave it wide open.

1427
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
So let's go to some of the answers on Facebook first.

1428
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
We'll start with Jeremy from the Koopa Club podcast.

1429
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I like them. They're fun.

1430
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
One of my biggest and happiest memories from childhood.

1431
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Was playing the original NES Legend of Zelda.

1432
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
With my older brother and sister.

1433
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
We are not what I'd call a close family.

1434
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And we don't really have much in common.

1435
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
But that game brought us all together as hokey as it sounds.

1436
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Exploring the dungeons.

1437
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Bombing every wall. Trying to burn every bush.

1438
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
It was an amazing experience for me as a five year old.

1439
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I remember going around trying to set every single bush on fire in the game.

1440
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Because you want to see if there's any more secrets.

1441
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Did you do that in Dark Soccer? Did you set everything on fire?

1442
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Oh I did and I bombed everything.

1443
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
And I tried to grab every single rock possible.

1444
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And I would bomb every wall.

1445
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I would run into every wall in a dungeon to see if I could walk through it.

1446
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I remember finding out on my own.

1447
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,000
I remember finding out on my own that like the first five dungeons?

1448
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
It might not be that many. It might only be like three or four.

1449
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
You can bomb every single solitary wall.

1450
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
That adjoins to another room.

1451
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
But that doesn't work later on.

1452
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Just because a room is next to it doesn't mean you can bomb through it.

1453
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I know. Cool story.

1454
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I also think it's very cool that you were playing games that were as cool as Zelda with your family.

1455
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
My mom didn't understand Zelda.

1456
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
You know what my mom would play though?

1457
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
The one game my mom would...

1458
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
And she wouldn't pick up the controller but she'd just bark at me what to do.

1459
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Like, do that Rob. Do that.

1460
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Anticipation.

1461
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Do you remember this?

1462
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Yeah.

1463
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
It was the little drawing game that was the board game.

1464
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I remember it.

1465
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
And they would draw the little pictures and my mom would just sit back in the chair and go,

1466
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
It's a trumpet. Rob. Rob, buzz in. It's a trumpet.

1467
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It's a trumpet, Rob.

1468
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Alright.

1469
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
We need to get your mom back on the show.

1470
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Today would be a good day for that.

1471
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I did say Happy Mother's Day at the top of the show, right?

1472
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I really hope so.

1473
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Yeah.

1474
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Alright.

1475
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Just making sure.

1476
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Oh, I know it's also Bobby's birthday.

1477
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
So, alright. Anyway.

1478
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:36,000
If I neglected to do so in the first half, a Happy Mother's Day to all of the folks celebrating today.

1479
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Whether you are yourself a mom or have somebody who is celebrating.

1480
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Back to the Facebook question of the week.

1481
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Fugu question of the week.

1482
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Xplink says,

1483
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
The first time playing Legend of Zelda for the first time it came out, after it came out,

1484
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
and trying to help my friend beat the game.

1485
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Playing it for hours on end, going through and trying to find all of the dungeons.

1486
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Called the Nintendo Power Hotline just to get help for it.

1487
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
And yes, my mother gave the OK for it.

1488
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Thus why I have the name Link for my handle.

1489
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Although the X-Link is a different story.

1490
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Well, I never knew that the Link part of that came from Zelda.

1491
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Remember when you had to get permission to call the tip line?

1492
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I never got.

1493
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I never did.

1494
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Yeah, I never.

1495
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Well.

1496
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
We had some long distance phone bills at my house.

1497
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I never got said permission from my mom.

1498
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
And so, you know, it was like, Rob, you are not calling Washington.

1499
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
You don't need to figure it out.

1500
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
You can figure it out, Rob.

1501
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I'd be like, Grandma, I'm calling that Nintendo line.

1502
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Why don't you write them a letter?

1503
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
You only can talk to them for 10 minutes.

1504
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
That was seriously.

1505
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I have to.

1506
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I have to.

1507
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I need to actually talk to my mom so I have my accent.

1508
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
You only got 10 minutes to talk to those people and then you got to hang up.

1509
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I don't care if they're halfway through conversation.

1510
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Yes, ma'am.

1511
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I did get permission later on to call the official Sierra bulletin board system, which was a long distance call.

1512
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
So I could download, like, King's Quest demos or something.

1513
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Alright, anyway.

1514
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Back to Foogle.

1515
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
And Matt J. on Facebook says,

1516
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,000
The Zelda series, along with Metroid, has always held a special place in my heart.

1517
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
The first Zelda title I ever played was A Link to the Past.

1518
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
It, along with Super Metroid, cemented my love of gaming.

1519
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
One of my greatest summers as a child was 1995.

1520
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Me and my two best friends at the time played through several SNES titles, A Link to the Past and Super Metroid.

1521
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I remember many a summer day playing through A Link to the Past with them.

1522
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Yes, it was a single player title, but it felt like we were playing it together.

1523
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
We would all huddle around my friend's small black and white TV, volume blaring as we went through the game.

1524
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I remember us getting all excited every time we beat a boss.

1525
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
We would take turns with the game, especially when it got to a point one of us couldn't get past.

1526
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Just getting through the game seemed almost magical.

1527
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
When you're 10 years old, getting through any game can seem magical, really.

1528
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:48,000
It was a great summer, and there was something to be said about getting through a game together with friends.

1529
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Sadly, I've long since lost touch with my two friends, but the memories will never die.

1530
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
It was due to that summer I developed my love for Metroid and Zelda.

1531
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
That's a really good story.

1532
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I got a little, like for real, I got a little, little verklempt hearing that story.

1533
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Are you talking amongst yourselves?

1534
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
I might be.

1535
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Well, you know, there's actually a bunch of chat going on right now about, you know, everyone's big retro games.

1536
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
You know, playing with their parents.

1537
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And I was actually just recalling the cutthroat games my mother and I would have with Dr. Mario.

1538
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Cutthroat.

1539
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
She would get mad.

1540
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I think you're cheating.

1541
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
That's cool that you could play those games, because my mom would only play the game shows.

1542
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:36,000
On Commodore 64, she would play Jeopardy and Family Feud with me.

1543
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
But that's really it.

1544
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Anyway, it's kind of sad the way.

1545
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Sadly, I've long since lost touch with my two friends, but the memories will never die.

1546
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I just want to play that song that will take you back to that summer.

1547
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Okay, if you get on the table and start dancing, I'm leaving.

1548
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I'm just going to walk through the football field and pump my fist.

1549
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Yeah, I just began it.

1550
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Anyway, back to more Facebook answers.

1551
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
James S. on the Fubo Question of the Week says,

1552
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Being six years old and finally completing A Link to the Past from start to finish without a guide, mind you, was one of my favorite childhood memories.

1553
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
It took my grandmother and my cousins about a year to finish it.

1554
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,000
To this day, I still play through it once every few years just to try and recapture that same magic from all those years ago.

1555
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:33,000
There's only one other game that holds the same magic and memories for me, and that's Illusion of Gaia.

1556
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
They just don't make them like they used to, eh guys?

1557
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Ain't that the truth?

1558
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Ain't that the truth?

1559
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Did you play through any adventure games, or was it just the competitive stuff that you played with your mom?

1560
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Well, my mom really liked playing Super Mario Brothers a lot, to the point where I would be chased out of my own room.

1561
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
But she wasn't really into Zelda or anything like that.

1562
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And when I borrowed my friend's, by borrow I mean, I borrowed it and he moved. Copy?

1563
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
So now it's yours.

1564
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Yeah, well that's also how I acquired my Chrono Trigger.

1565
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
He hasn't asked for it back. I actually keep in touch with the guy and he has never asked for it back.

1566
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:20,000
So, but I ended up playing through the first Zelda and my mom was like, you're playing that game.

1567
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Sorry, I'm looking on Twitter and I'm cracking up because Bobby tweeted a picture.

1568
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,000
He's holding up the anticipation cartridge and he just tweeted, it's a trumpet.

1569
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I think one of the game pieces was a trumpet. I don't think that was actually...

1570
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
No, I think there was like a meta, like one of the answers then was trumpet. It was very meta.

1571
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Like later in the game it would actually draw a trumpet.

1572
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I miss like good game show games like that.

1573
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And then there was one versus a hundred. Don't get me started.

1574
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
You know what I miss actually as far as game shows go? Win, lose or draw.

1575
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
They're making draw something into a game show which is the same thing.

1576
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I know, but draw something is actually pretty.

1577
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
But it doesn't have Burt Reynolds and Burt Conroy. Conroy? What was his name?

1578
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Conroy.

1579
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Well it's just like how they made words with friends into a board game.

1580
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Or bejeweled into a board game.

1581
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Fuck, I just would play Scrabble.

1582
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Which was also a great game show.

1583
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
You know what actually was also a good game show? Bumper Stumpers.

1584
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
That was a great game show. On USA?

1585
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Chuck Woolry.

1586
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I sure do.

1587
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Chuck Woolry is the man.

1588
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
It was on USA just before up all night.

1589
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
All right.

1590
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Sayo Surumagawa says beating the water temple without help when I was 10.

1591
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Wicked says not a specific memory in game but an entire game itself.

1592
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.

1593
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
It took every single thing that made the first Legend of Zelda good, multiplied it by 10,

1594
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
then took everything I felt was bad in it and nullified it.

1595
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
There was no bad in the original Legend of Zelda. What's wrong with you? I'm just kidding.

1596
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Zelda 2 maybe.

1597
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1598
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I know people love Zelda 2 but ugh.

1599
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:55,000
The graphics were colorful, the music was orchestral, the control was tight, the design was brilliant.

1600
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Granted I haven't played a Zelda game past Link's Awakening,

1601
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,000
but I have to say what I have played A Link to the Past is the greatest Zelda game ever made.

1602
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Ragenator says my favorite memory is beating the first quest of the original Zelda game on the NES as a kid for the first time.

1603
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Andy R. lastly on Facebook says when I was younger I really wanted Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.

1604
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,000
While I was visiting my grandmother my parents told me they'd buy me a game so off we went to the game store.

1605
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:26,000
The whole way there I explained to my grandmother how there were two games and how they were related and such.

1606
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Straight out of Nintendo Power I'm sure.

1607
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
When we got there my parents told me they'd only buy me one of them.

1608
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
I picked one and we went home.

1609
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
That night I was playing it and my grandmother came over with a grin,

1610
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
handed me the other game, and told me to keep it a secret from my parents.

1611
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Aww.

1612
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,000
That was so good. I'm like choking here. That's a great Mother's Day story.

1613
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
My grandma bought me a Killer Instinct.

1614
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
That explains a lot.

1615
01:49:53,000 --> 01:50:01,000
She took me to four different stores to buy Killer Instinct until we found it at Rest in Peace Montgomery Wards.

1616
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
To be fair I had to- no it wasn't my mom it was my dad.

1617
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
My dad was the only one that would go to software etc. and all that with me.

1618
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
So when Mortal Kombat came out and all that.

1619
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
And I pitched a fit until they gave me my CD.

1620
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
You? Pitching a fit? Even younger?

1621
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Girl.

1622
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Alright. Let's go to Google+. Just a couple answers over there.

1623
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
The first one from Rettertainment.

1624
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
When we were kids my sister and I both had our own Game Boys.

1625
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,000
This was the original large black and white Game Boy.

1626
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,000
My sister broke her Game Boy by hitting it while she was playing it.

1627
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
My sister begged and pleaded with me to allow her to play with my Game Boy.

1628
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I said no because she broke hers and I was sure she would break mine in the same way my sister broke hers.

1629
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
After her typical high amount of whining and crying to my parents.

1630
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:49,000
My parents told me to let my sister play my Game Boy despite me being absolutely sure that she would break it.

1631
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
My sister did end up breaking my Game Boy by hitting it as she was playing it.

1632
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
She was playing Zelda Link's Awakening at the time.

1633
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:02,000
This might not sound like a good memory but it is because I was proven to be right and I like being right.

1634
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I especially like being right when my sister and my parents are wrong.

1635
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Love it.

1636
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:17,000
And lastly Flaco Jones saying the ending to Link's Awakening was the best video game ending I have ever experienced to that point.

1637
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
And still ranks up there with my favorite endings ever.

1638
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:25,000
The Ballad of the Wind Fish just adds to it by being the most memorable Zelda game moment for me.

1639
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I read every answer tonight. I shortened some of them a little bit for time but every answer if you want to see the complete answers.

1640
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLawnsRadio or Google Plus OrangeLawnsRadio.

1641
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,000
It's not too late to add your response either because the people that posted before will see it.

1642
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
So great job tonight you guys.

1643
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I loved some of those stories.

1644
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:49,000
The big memory ones about Grandma and about the two friends you don't talk to anymore.

1645
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
That got me in a special place. It did.

1646
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Alright. You alright?

1647
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I was thinking about my grandma.

1648
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Yeah.

1649
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
You know what else she was responsible for?

1650
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Was this the same one who got you Killer Instinct?

1651
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Yes.

1652
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Oh wow.

1653
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I'll go ahead and just give the quick, quick story.

1654
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:11,000
She's got a dead hip socket, had three strokes and cerebral vasculitis.

1655
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Meaning that she has swelling in her arteries and veins and everything in her brain.

1656
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
And two aneurysms.

1657
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I talked to her the other day. She was just fine.

1658
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
And I remember that she also...

1659
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
And I don't think she actually realized what she was getting me at the time.

1660
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:34,000
But she also got me my Kirby's Avalanche.

1661
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Which you know my love for all things peel, peel.

1662
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:44,000
She got me my entire collection of Red Hot Chili Peppers cassettes at the time.

1663
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Because I was super, super obsessed with Red Hot Chili Peppers.

1664
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Really?

1665
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
In high school.

1666
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,000
And then she put up with me blasting Radiohead at all hours of the night.

1667
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
My grandma is the best.

1668
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,000
And she would always say that she was trying not to spoil me.

1669
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
But she did spoil me pretty bad.

1670
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
And she took care of me when my mom moved to Arizona.

1671
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
We'll give her a hug for all of us when we go to Alabama.

1672
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I will. I will.

1673
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Let's move on with some more news tonight.

1674
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Loki.

1675
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Alright.

1676
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:21,000
So we've been kind of talking about how there's not a lot of games on the Wii U.

1677
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:26,000
And unfortunately not a lot of games from EA on the Wii U.

1678
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
And it doesn't sound like that's going to be changing anytime soon.

1679
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Because the brand new Frostbite 3 engine that they're going to be using for Battlefield 4.

1680
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,000
And I think I want to say a lot of the upcoming sports games.

1681
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Like they're going to be going with the Frostbite 3 engine.

1682
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
That's where the next Mass Effect is.

1683
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Yes. Dragon Age, Mass Effect.

1684
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
They will not run on the Wii U.

1685
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
So.

1686
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Uh oh.

1687
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Yeah. That's not good.

1688
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:00,000
And I think, I mean, you could say that they may be able to port it to Wii U.

1689
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
If they created another engine that could ride it.

1690
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
You know, maybe like an upgraded Frostbite 2 engine.

1691
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Kind of like how they do with some of the Unreal 3 stuff or whatever.

1692
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
But is it really worth it to them?

1693
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I mean, they're just kind of saying, do we really want to put this much effort into creating a new engine?

1694
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
To only sell like maybe 100,000 copies, if that?

1695
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Well then I bet Mass Effect 3 didn't exactly sell very well.

1696
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
But it's because there wasn't 1 and 2.

1697
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Well that and the whole preview, whatever the Genesis 2 was, was shit.

1698
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Utter shit.

1699
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Even if they just didn't have the gamepad functioning in 1 and 2, just port them over.

1700
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
God.

1701
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,000
But I guess it's easier for me to sit here and say, just cram it from that box into that box.

1702
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Just amp up the graphics in level 3.

1703
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
I'm sure they could have done that.

1704
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:55,000
But I'm willing to bet a lot of the reasons why they don't have games being ported over there is

1705
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Nintendo probably requires a certain amount of connectivity with the gamepad.

1706
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:03,000
And if they're saying, okay listen, you have to use the gamepad in some function.

1707
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,000
That's probably why you see a lot of these games not getting Wii U ports.

1708
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,000
YYR in chat needs some clarification. Are they developing the same engine for 360 and PS3?

1709
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Or is this for the next...

1710
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Wait, so 360 won't run on the Wii U?

1711
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
That's weird.

1712
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
That's because no one cares about the Wii U.

1713
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Well I thought that they built the Wii U to be similar in structure to 360.

1714
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Yeah because the new game, Battlefield 4, it is a current gen release as well as next gen.

1715
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
And it will be running on that.

1716
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Well, if you can't get the next Mass Effect and Dragon Age games, why not get the next best thing?

1717
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Converted smartphone games.

1718
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
What?

1719
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Alright, well maybe that's not really the next best thing.

1720
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
But it's something that the Wii U will have going for it.

1721
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:51,000
They're coaxing smartphone developers to adapt their apps for the system.

1722
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:56,000
This is according to sources, so take it with a grain of salt, but it's in the Japan Times.

1723
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Nintendo, quote, has offered professional use conversion software, quote, to certain app devs

1724
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:07,000
in the hopes that smartphone software could help boost the Wii U's sales figures.

1725
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:12,000
I'm assuming that's just to kind of boost up some of the eShop content,

1726
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:18,000
which we've heard is very indie friendly to begin with, but I'm not sure that alone is going to save the Wii U.

1727
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:24,000
I mean, granted, a robust downloadable title stuff will help tremendously,

1728
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,000
but it's not going to be one on those mobile games alone.

1729
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I think most people who want to play mobile phone games will get a mobile phone.

1730
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Or already have one.

1731
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
That's right.

1732
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Or they'll get an Ouya.

1733
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura.

1734
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Well, we do have some news.

1735
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:48,000
This is something that I thought was really cool, and I'm going to be checking it out.

1736
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I haven't quite yet, but I've been reading up on it.

1737
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:57,000
There is a game called GeoGuessr that is, it basically uses Google Maps,

1738
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
and it drops you in a location.

1739
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:06,000
And you have only a few, you can go a few blocks, you can walk around.

1740
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,000
It's sort of like you were, you know, kidnapped and got away, and you have no fucking clue where you are.

1741
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:18,000
So you use your clues around, and then you have a map, and you can pick on the map where you are.

1742
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
And the closer you get, the more points you get.

1743
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:26,000
So you have five rounds, and so by the end of it, you can share your scores with your friends.

1744
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
You can be competitive.

1745
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:37,000
And they actually are saying on the GeoGuessr Twitter that he's working on other type of competitive play options.

1746
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:46,000
And there's this one scene on here where it's just showing a plain road with dirt around it,

1747
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
and you have to figure out where you are, so it's really...

1748
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Which is sadly what most of it looks like, most of Google Maps looks like if you really think about it.

1749
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Like that one that you're on right there, that picture?

1750
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Yeah.

1751
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:02,000
To me, I would put that on the stretch between Nevada and...

1752
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Let me look at this really big here. Does it say where it's at?

1753
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
No, I don't think so.

1754
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Well, you have to use some educated. It's not in the flatlands because you see mountains in the background.

1755
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:19,000
That's what I'm saying, the stretch between Henderson and Las Vegas. Not Henderson.

1756
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:24,000
There's a big stretch of road that actually runs from Phoenix to Las Vegas.

1757
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,000
And I've been there, and it looks just like it.

1758
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
That could just easily be I-5, honestly.

1759
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
That could be I-5.

1760
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I don't know. Too bad you don't have smell-o-vision because if you smell cow death, you know you're on the I-5.

1761
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
And you drive right past Kalschwitz.

1762
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I like games out of Google Maps, though. Things like that. I like those little exploration games.

1763
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
There's so much cool shit on Google Maps.

1764
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:52,000
And to the Wii U's credit, that's one of the cool things I've enjoyed on the Wii U is that Google exploration thing where you can actually panorama around.

1765
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
But you know what I would love to see?

1766
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Is a Google Maps integrated Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

1767
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Now that's awesome.

1768
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Couldn't you see that? And you have to do the shop view to see if she's inside a place.

1769
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Oh, that's rad.

1770
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Okay, don't steal my ideas.

1771
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Patent pending.

1772
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Patent pending.

1773
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,000
You heard it here first. I'm gonna be starting a Kickstarter tomorrow.

1774
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Except, wait a minute.

1775
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Hiring programmers.

1776
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
You don't own Carmen Sandiego, so...

1777
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
I'll be like...

1778
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
We're gonna do... I'm gonna be the star. It'll be Where the Fuck is Jamie now?

1779
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
There you go. There you go.

1780
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
So...

1781
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
When in doubt, change the star to yourself.

1782
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Yeah.

1783
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Great logic.

1784
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Yeah, it'll be like...

1785
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
You know, we haven't had an OLR dream game in a while. Maybe that's...

1786
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
So that's our new dream game, Where the Fuck is Jamie?

1787
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Where the Fuck is Jamie now?

1788
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
What do you think, Loki?

1789
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
If you were gonna make this game realistic, it'd be in her pajamas at home.

1790
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Found her again.

1791
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
She's in the same spot.

1792
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,000
She's at 7-Eleven buying Guinness. Again.

1793
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Click. Click.

1794
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
No, no, no, no, no. I live in Citrus Heights. It's the Tower Mart.

1795
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Wait a minute. She's at Disneyland.

1796
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Yep.

1797
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Woo!

1798
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
She dragged Dan to a Starbucks saying, coffee.

1799
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,000
No, no, no. We go to It's a Grind. Remember, it's near my house.

1800
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Sorry.

1801
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
No, no.

1802
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Why don't you just give the listeners your address while you're at it?

1803
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Do you know what? Honestly, if we were gonna be...

1804
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
If we were gonna do, like, places that I actually go to,

1805
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
it would be Disneyland, the Bravo Cheese Farms.

1806
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And the computer room at my house in my pajamas.

1807
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
And maybe Becky's house.

1808
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Prince Brightstar in chat says, needs a co-star Waldo-type character.

1809
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Well, that would be me.

1810
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
We'll have to put you in the beanie.

1811
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:38,000
And, uh, I don't know. If it was like a road trip locator thing,

1812
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:42,000
then we can have, you know, Loki building Grand Theft Auto maps.

1813
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Frisbee says, have you tried checking Pinkberry?

1814
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
You know.

1815
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
You know, I was the mayor of three Pinkberries.

1816
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,000
I hate giving them all this free publicity, but that cookies and cream?

1817
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Oh, my God.

1818
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I need to go.

1819
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Oh, so good.

1820
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Because I'm...

1821
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
So good.

1822
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I just haven't been given a fuck. We have It's a...

1823
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
It's at my house in M&M's, which I brought some here.

1824
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Alright, anyway.

1825
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Yeah.

1826
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Hi, Loki.

1827
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
You have something besides where the fuck is Jamie now?

1828
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Yes.

1829
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Um, let's talk about Google Play.

1830
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,000
You know, going back to mobile phone games again.

1831
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Um, Google Play Games is apparently something that leaked out.

1832
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Uh, thanks to the Android Police.

1833
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Yes, that's actually a website.

1834
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:29,000
And, uh, it's from, I guess, Play Services APK Teardown.

1835
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
And what is Google Play Games?

1836
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Well, it's basically their version of Game Center.

1837
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,000
It's got all sorts of wonderful features, including, you know, in-game chat.

1838
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Um, they're saying that cloud saves, achievements, leaderboards, uh, invites, matchmaking, lobbies.

1839
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
All sorts of fun stuff.

1840
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
And, uh, that will be coming, I guess, soon.

1841
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
And maybe they're saying that, um, it could be even revealed this week.

1842
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I guess Google's IO event is this week.

1843
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Um, it'd be interesting.

1844
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I would be kind of interested to see if they're gonna kind of translate this into almost like a console.

1845
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
I mean, it'd be interesting.

1846
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
I know Google-

1847
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Just what we need. Another console.

1848
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
We've already got the big three. We've got the Ouya.

1849
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Now we just had a report on this mobile phone console.

1850
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
There's too many consoles.

1851
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:25,000
I do not want Google to make a console.

1852
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I want Google to team up with somebody else.

1853
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Which, who knows? Could Microsoft team up with Google?

1854
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
No, they're not really friends, right?

1855
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,000
But then again, to take out Apple, they might. Who knows?

1856
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I don't know. There's that Apple-Google rivalry, I think, that they would form an axis.

1857
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
To take down the mighty fruit.

1858
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Interesting. You know, Apple hasn't announced anything in a while either. It's been a very long time.

1859
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,000
No new iPads, no new iPhones.

1860
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
They're taking a nap. They're taking a nap.

1861
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
A little nap? A little napple?

1862
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
An apple.

1863
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Alright. Well, we know that-

1864
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
And Prince Brightstar in chat says, no love for PC.

1865
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Well, a PC- I don't know if that's in reference to what I said.

1866
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
A PC, I don't really count as a console.

1867
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
But obviously, yes, all these games go on PC too.

1868
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I mean, there's some things you can only get on PC.

1869
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Like World of Warcraft.

1870
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Coming out soon is the PlayStation 4, which we'll be getting some games-

1871
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Can we get well on Mac?

1872
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
That were on PC. Well, sorry. Yes. Yes, you can.

1873
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:24,000
PlayStation 4 is going to get Diablo 3, which to now is only on PC and Mac.

1874
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
But PlayStation 4 is going to have that share button.

1875
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Where you can instantly share things to Facebook or whatever the PSN that's built in and so forth.

1876
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,000
But something about the share button that's coming out this week.

1877
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Shuhei Yoshida, who is the president of Sony Worldwide Studios,

1878
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,000
noted in an interview with 4Gamer, which is a Japanese site,

1879
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,000
that the share button is limited to what developers will allow.

1880
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Which makes a lot of sense.

1881
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
You don't necessarily want people to be able to share everything.

1882
02:03:53,000 --> 02:04:00,000
For example, like on the Vita, you can have certain scenes disable this.

1883
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,000
So you can take a screenshot and the share function might share the screenshot.

1884
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,000
But you might not be able to actually take a video of the entire final boss.

1885
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,000
So you wouldn't be able to share the ending of the game two hours after the game launches.

1886
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Or something like that. So that makes sense.

1887
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:22,000
But what else I thought was interesting about the interview is that the video sharing function was inspired by

1888
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:28,000
the fact that Shuhei Yoshida wanted to play Dark Souls all day long.

1889
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:33,000
So he would watch videos of other people playing the game since he was too busy.

1890
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
So that's where the share button came from.

1891
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:39,000
So that Dark Souls 3 or whatever ends up on the PlayStation 4,

1892
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:43,000
he'll be able to use the share button to watch other people play.

1893
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
So he's a lawyer.

1894
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Maybe he likes to watch.

1895
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Well, he might like to watch, but we like to read.

1896
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
And every week you guys email us.

1897
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1898
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
DarkSakura ever so happily opens up the mailbag,

1899
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,000
dives in and finds a few emails to read for you.

1900
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Right now, DarkSakura.

1901
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
You know what, every time I look at the mailbag,

1902
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Eddie Inzer's voice goes into my head going,

1903
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
IT'S ALL STICKY!

1904
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Hi, everyone at OLR.

1905
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
This is your friendly neighborhood rage-inator.

1906
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Unfortunately, I do not have any gaming-related topics this week,

1907
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:24,000
but I do have some good news to geek out over.

1908
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:34,000
You could say I have some perfect news.

1909
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:40,000
As of 3.30pm EDT, on Friday 5-10-13, I am the proud-as-hell cat owner.

1910
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Proud-as-all-hell cat owner. I saw your kitty and your kitty is cute.

1911
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
I'm sorry, I was very busy when you messaged me.

1912
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I went to my local SPCA and adopted the most adorable 2-year-old male cat

1913
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,000
at the SPCA named Anakin, who is mostly white with some black patches.

1914
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
I swear, this cat's back looks like a Rorschach test.

1915
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
It's awesome. You should name him Rorschach.

1916
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:04,000
But when you beg him for mercy, he might say no.

1917
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
I don't know.

1918
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
He'll say meow.

1919
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Meow.

1920
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,000
He's extremely friendly and playful. Granted, due to the new environment,

1921
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:17,000
he's been hiding under my bed for a while, but I'm sure he'll warm up to my place.

1922
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Smile heart.

1923
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I haven't had the opportunity to take his picture yet and upload it yet,

1924
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,000
but I'm working on it and I hope he'll be comfortable enough around my place

1925
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
by Sunday evening when your show airs and you three take calls

1926
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
that that way the three of you get to see him.

1927
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Now, I do like to propose a poll for your show.

1928
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Do I keep Anakin as a cat's name or do I name him after Booger,

1929
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
the character from Revenge of the Nerds movies?

1930
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I still think you should name him Rorschach.

1931
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:44,000
We're not polling it because Anakin is a clear better name than Booger.

1932
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I don't know. I had a friend that had a cat named Booger.

1933
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I told you about Dan's grandfather, named his cats Hiss and Spit.

1934
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,000
And then I had a friend in high school that had a cat named Bitch.

1935
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And I know someone now who has a cat named Asshole.

1936
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
But Bitch is a dog.

1937
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Irony, Rob. Irony. It's very hipster, okay?

1938
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Now, Rob, I'll let you finish, but I have to say that I have the greatest kitty ever.

1939
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
This email is brought to you by Fuzzy Wuzzy Kitties.

1940
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
No, you don't.

1941
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Come here, Sanrio. Sanrio.

1942
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Sanrio is under your bed.

1943
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Yeah, Sanrio hates people.

1944
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I love Midna so fucking much.

1945
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Midna is super fucking adorable.

1946
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:30,000
You should just rename your Tumblr Fuck Yeah Midna because that's all it is.

1947
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
It's not all it is.

1948
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
You already have like seven Tumblr accounts.

1949
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
What's one more? You need a Fuck Yeah Midna.

1950
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
I actually made one for one of the fanfics I'm writing.

1951
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
See? How many Tumblers do you have?

1952
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Fuck, hold on. I have my main. I have that one.

1953
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I have sleep waking, which is my art. I have an art history Tumblr.

1954
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
I barely have enough shit to post to one Tumblr.

1955
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
I have mass affecting. I have mass affecting.

1956
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
I have one Tumblr. Hello Robbie.

1957
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
If you want to follow me on Tumblr. Hello Robbie. R-O-B-B-I-E.

1958
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
I have seven Tumblers.

1959
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Do you really?

1960
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I really do.

1961
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I wasn't lying. This is an intervention.

1962
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
You know what? Bite me.

1963
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I did my art history blog just because I know not everyone gives a shit about

1964
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Destiel and the Bauhaus movement, okay?

1965
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:23,000
So I made that one and then Mass Effect started taking over my main one

1966
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:28,000
so I made my Mass Effect blog and whatever. Don't judge me.

1967
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,000
ActDeaf suggests name him Anagar.

1968
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Anagan plus Booger.

1969
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,000
You know I think-

1970
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Name him Rorschach.

1971
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Now Alan obviously named the cats because they were already ten years old

1972
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
by the time I got in the picture.

1973
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
But I believed when Alan named Maruko,

1974
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,000
I think that was two things combined like that.

1975
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
I think from what he told me.

1976
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Okay and actually Queen Simeon in chat says Holstein.

1977
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Because he's colored like a cat.

1978
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Alright next email.

1979
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
It's a cute kid email.

1980
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Too many cats, not enough games. Although then again there's no such thing as too many cats.

1981
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I was about to say, you know the rule.

1982
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
The internet is made for cats.

1983
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And porn.

1984
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
But mostly cats.

1985
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
And porn.

1986
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
And porn.

1987
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Cats.

1988
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I see what you did there.

1989
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Cat porn?

1990
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I like pussy.

1991
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,000
You know, don't get me started on the furry community.

1992
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:28,000
I love, no I actually really like fursuiters.

1993
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,000
I love the care and attention that go into the costumes.

1994
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
There's just some art I don't need to see.

1995
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,000
But they're welcome to draw it and I just won't look at it.

1996
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,000
That's my approach toward any fandom.

1997
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
You can enjoy your fandom, enjoy your ship.

1998
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I don't have to look at it.

1999
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Don't get me wrong, I like Muppets.

2000
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I just don't like Muppets, you know.

2001
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Trust me, if it exists someone has slashed it.

2002
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
This is the internet.

2003
02:09:53,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Okay, this is from, I'm just gonna say Sam because I don't sign it.

2004
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
It's just Sam.

2005
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Hello O.L.R. Crew, I love the show.

2006
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Hi Sam, thanks Sam.

2007
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Thank you Rob.

2008
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I say Nintendo should have checked with developers before the release of the Wii U to see if the console was good to go.

2009
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Third party devs have no obligation to make games for any system.

2010
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Nintendo may have to support their own console this time around.

2011
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Hey, Microsoft and Sony have also had their bad days.

2012
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:29,000
I think we have also made that point on the show, I do agree.

2013
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Just because you have a system don't mean people's gonna put shit on it.

2014
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
In the story.

2015
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
They ain't got time for that shit.

2016
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,000
So, last email.

2017
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Hey O.L.R. Crew, I wanted to tip my hat in along with Loki and Sky's complaints about Nintendo's game from Episode 503.

2018
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Both of you brought up perfectly valid points and I want to bring up an issue too.

2019
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Namely with Nintendo not putting enough content in their games to make them feel, quote, complete.

2020
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:02,000
For example, Wii Sports Resort was touted to be a major upgrade from the first Wii Sports.

2021
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I don't own Wii Sports Resorts, though after taking a look at the FAQ for it, I'm convinced it's just a small step up with all the new mini games included.

2022
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:16,000
I understand Wii Sports and other Nintendo games that typically star Miis are intended for casual audiences.

2023
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:25,000
But why won't Nintendo put in effort to toss in features aside from online multiplayer, like your Mii having stats that affect gameplay or a complete fleshed out tournament mode.

2024
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Not only would these features appeal to core players, it would give the casuals a sense of progress and an enticing reason to come back to the game.

2025
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I actually agree with that. That would catch me playing it instead of, ugh, I hit the ball.

2026
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:46,000
For real, I really wish Nintendo would, it just pisses me off.

2027
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Nintendo needs to steal some people from Microsoft or even Sony that get online better, that get the enhanced value of it.

2028
02:11:53,000 --> 02:12:02,000
It really, it just pains me that Nintendo won't try to advance the social aspect of gaming online.

2029
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:08,000
But then again, they made buku bucks off of party games, so you know what, whatever works for them, right?

2030
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Well, it's also Nintendo which I think still refuses to, it's like they put, we're not crossing the line, we're not crossing the line, we'll touch the line but we aren't crossing it.

2031
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:22,000
We do things our way. We do things the Miyamoto way.

2032
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:28,000
I also believe my beef with Nintendo applies to some of the flagship games too.

2033
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:38,000
New Super Mario Bros. U only unlocks one extra world after you beat the game whereas Super Mario 3D Land put up another eight whole worlds that are substantially tougher.

2034
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Substantially. I'm all tongue tied.

2035
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:47,000
And how many people know that the upcoming Super Luigi U DLC only allows 100 seconds per stage?

2036
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Really?

2037
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Hearing that gives me the impression Nintendo is being cheap by not offering stages of standard length.

2038
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Well, we do like it long.

2039
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:04,000
OLR crew, please cheer me up by answering this question. What are some of the games you've invested an ass load of time into?

2040
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Mouse effect.

2041
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:10,000
No, stay mad. I'm just kidding, I'll answer. What's the rest of it?

2042
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I personally sunk somewhere over 2,000 hours into Phantasy Star Online a few years ago and more recently I played the Binding of Isaac for over 600 hours.

2043
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Stay fresh everyone and don't be a cudwafter.

2044
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Spelled like the type that cows chew.

2045
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Cudwafter.

2046
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Cudwafter.

2047
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
That's like gonna be my favorite game name ever.

2048
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
And that's from the Nasty Canasta.

2049
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:34,000
One of my favorite listener names by the way.

2050
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Cause I always just imagine a game of like Strip Canasta, like the card game, but anyway.

2051
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Strip Canasta?

2052
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Cause it's Nasty Canasta.

2053
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
You know the card game?

2054
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
I know.

2055
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Alright.

2056
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,000
It's like Dirty P-Nuckle.

2057
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,000
P now P-Nuckle?

2058
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:00,000
That's like your sister or brother would be Dirty P-Nuckle.

2059
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Dirty P-Nuckle.

2060
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Anyway, what was the question? You didn't even ask for that.

2061
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Fuck, I just closed it.

2062
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Oh, what game have you...

2063
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Sunk a lot of time into.

2064
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:15,000
World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XI, and insert MMO here.

2065
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Mass Effect 3, a disgusting amount with a multiplayer, has really enhanced that.

2066
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I'm actually gonna be starting over on the whole series again.

2067
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I am going to keep Dramamine by my computer and play through the first Mass Effect again because I love the story in it best of any of them.

2068
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,000
But I get so damn motion sick.

2069
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:37,000
I turn off the film grain, I turn off the wiggle, whatever, the motion blur.

2070
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Still get sicker than anything on the stupid Mako missions.

2071
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,000
What about you, Loki? Grand Theft Auto?

2072
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Grand Theft Auto.

2073
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Alien Defense Force, Earth Defense Force.

2074
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Yeah, Earth Defense Force, Saints Row.

2075
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:56,000
We even called Diddy a bit because we played it for multiplayer, but I don't play a ton of that.

2076
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Probably Grand Theft Auto IV. It's a lot of fun. I don't know.

2077
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:06,000
It's funny that I was talking to Dan about me playing Ragnarok Online 2 because he's like,

2078
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Well, you only played the first one for ten years, which is true.

2079
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Something like that.

2080
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Well, I played Ragnarok Online since it was in the Japanese beta because I started playing it in Japanese.

2081
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
And then I moved over to IRO when they opened the beta here.

2082
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,000
And then I played through paid IRO.

2083
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:29,000
And then I went to free servers.

2084
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:35,000
You know, I'm actually one of the few people that would still have my original account intact because I was a beta tester.

2085
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Oh, nice.

2086
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Yeah. That was another one that ate a lot of my time.

2087
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Civilization 1. I played a disgusting amount of that on PC.

2088
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I'm not surprised at all.

2089
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Alright. More emails? Or was that it?

2090
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,000
That was it.

2091
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2092
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
I can't believe I didn't even say this.

2093
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I would play Super Street Fighter 2 on my SNES all the time.

2094
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:01,000
I would have people over who were like, We're gonna play games. We're not playing Super Street Fighter 2.

2095
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
And it's like, Okay, Kirby's Avalanche.

2096
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Those were my two SNES days.

2097
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Good times.

2098
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

2099
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:34,000
I have a few FUs because I have been carrying quite a bit of angst this past week.

2100
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,000
FU number one goes to my stupid allergies.

2101
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I have developed a weed allergy.

2102
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
And Dan brought me donuts last night.

2103
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
And I was like, Donuts? I'll eat the hell out of those.

2104
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Nope. Stick.

2105
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
And then to plane ticket costs.

2106
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Okay, get this.

2107
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,000
New Orleans is a much bigger airport than Gulfport, right?

2108
02:16:54,000 --> 02:17:01,000
But it would have cost me another 75 to 100 bucks to fly into New Orleans.

2109
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Which I wouldn't do anyway because it's three hours from Mobile.

2110
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Whereas Gulfport is like an hour and a half.

2111
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:13,000
And if I had flown into Mobile, it would have bumped up my plane ticket almost to another $300 because it's so much smaller.

2112
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:20,000
And then I was thinking, well, you know what? If I stay a full two weeks, you know, arrive on a Tuesday, leave on a Tuesday,

2113
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,000
yeah, that's going to be a lot better for my cost. No.

2114
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I'm leaving on a Thursday. If I had stayed until Tuesday the following week, it would have bumped my ticket up by like another 150 bucks.

2115
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:37,000
It's stupid. It is completely stupid how much plane tickets cost.

2116
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,000
And then all the shit you have to go through when you get to the airport.

2117
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
And 50 bucks to check in a bag and all that crap too.

2118
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Oh my God. You know what? I seriously looked at Amtrak, but it would have taken me a week to get there.

2119
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:52,000
And as much as I would love to ride the train, I don't have that kind of time.

2120
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:57,000
I even paid an extra $35 so that I could get the shortest flight possible.

2121
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Because the flights that wanted to give me the lowest price possible were something like 10 hours, including two layovers.

2122
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:08,000
And I was like, the moment I see the Atlanta airport on there, I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2123
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Atlanta airport is like the bane of my existence.

2124
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Don't tell me this because I have to fly to Atlanta for Dragon Con.

2125
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:23,000
No, Rob. Just one awesome thing, though, is the never ending escalator that just goes up.

2126
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:26,000
You cannot see the end of it for like an hour.

2127
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I refuse to believe anything is worse than the Philadelphia airport.

2128
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Thankfully, I've not done the Philadelphia airport.

2129
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:32,000
It's pretty bad.

2130
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
But I still think to this day my favorite airport for layout would have to be Burbank.

2131
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Oh, I love Burbank.

2132
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Burbank is so easy.

2133
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Burbank, yeah. That's what I always call it.

2134
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Or believe it or not, Dallas Fort Worth is actually a really well laid out airport.

2135
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:48,000
And you can get rides on the little golf carts.

2136
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Like, let's talk about airports.

2137
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,000
All right.

2138
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
OK. And then my last one.

2139
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Now, like I use this with a disclaimer.

2140
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I love my kitten.

2141
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
My baby is so sweet.

2142
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:04,000
But she had claws on her and clawed the crap out of my leg.

2143
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
She was pouncing my feet like I'd walk by pounce.

2144
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
And then she decided that she was going to call up my calf.

2145
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
So finally we sat her down.

2146
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:16,000
And then she, you know, Dan's holding her and I'm trying to clip her little claws.

2147
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
And she's wiggling and moving her paws out of the way.

2148
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,000
And making the most god awful noise.

2149
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
It was like this.

2150
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Oh, lordy.

2151
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Yeah, that noise.

2152
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
And I'm like, Mimi.

2153
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,000
And then she runs off.

2154
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
And the first thing, you know what she does once I'm done with her?

2155
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
The first thing she does is goes into her room,

2156
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
looks at her bolt and says, you're giving me a treat woman.

2157
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
So I did.

2158
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
All right.

2159
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Uh, Loki.

2160
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Uh, I guess, uh, F.U. to be called.

2161
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
For not getting orders correct.

2162
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Fair enough.

2163
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Is that it?

2164
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
All right.

2165
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:55,000
My F.U. of the week goes to the scale for telling me the truth.

2166
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Next time lie to me and make me feel better about myself, asshole.

2167
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,000
All right.

2168
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Let's get to a couple more news stories.

2169
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,000
And then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2170
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,000
But first, Loki.

2171
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
So he has gotten some more funding,

2172
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
not necessarily from Kickstarter, but from some outside investors,

2173
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
including Nvidia, actually.

2174
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Nvidia is investing money in the as well as the Mayfield Fund,

2175
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Shasta Ventures and OCam Partners, who I have no fucking clue who they are.

2176
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
But, um, yeah.

2177
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
So they've got another 15 million dollars, which will help them launch retail.

2178
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Speaking of which, their retail launch, as I expected, was delayed to June 25th,

2179
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:41,000
as opposed to June 4th, because there's no fucking way they would ever hit that target

2180
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:44,000
with how fast they're shipping, you know, the Kickstarter backers.

2181
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,000
And on top of that, the people that preordered on Ouya.tv.

2182
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:57,000
And they say they have 12,000 developers who registered to make an Ouya game.

2183
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
So that's not necessarily 12,000 games that are out there,

2184
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:04,000
but 12,000 people that are, yeah, possibly going to make a game.

2185
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,000
So, I don't know.

2186
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:12,000
They claim they're ahead of schedule, but I don't buy it.

2187
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
How much did you play your Ouya this week?

2188
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Uh, for a little bit.

2189
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I don't remember how long it was, though, but I checked out.

2190
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,000
What did I check out this week?

2191
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
I downloaded this frog game that's supposed to be pretty fun.

2192
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:31,000
I played more of the Pingu puzzle poker, which I may be writing a review on that at some point.

2193
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I don't know. I don't want to yet, because it's still, like, beta.

2194
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:38,000
It's not the finished game, so, you know, you don't want to do that.

2195
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I know I played some of that. I just downloaded some more stuff.

2196
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
I don't really remember playing any of the games.

2197
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:49,000
There's a few I tried that were kind of lame, but I don't remember exactly where they were.

2198
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Still haven't played Final Fantasy III.

2199
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
That's alright.

2200
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Anyhow, moving on to one more story tonight.

2201
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:02,000
This is about a comment from Bobby Kotick, who is the CEO of Activision.

2202
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Saying in an earnings call this week, where they were talking about the loss of WoW subscribers and so forth,

2203
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:14,000
but this isn't about PC stuff or WoW, this is about console.

2204
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:20,000
This is about the new consoles, Xbox, Lube, Infinity, 720, whatever you want to call it.

2205
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Lubefinity.

2206
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Lubefinity, and the PlayStation 4.

2207
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Quote, there are still many unknown factors such as pricing, launch dates, and quantities, the level of first party support,

2208
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:36,000
and, importantly, consumer purchase intent in a world where consoles are no longer just competing with each other,

2209
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,000
but also with new platforms such as smartphones and tablets.

2210
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,000
He also went on to say that Wii U had a, quote, very slow start,

2211
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:50,000
and uncertainties in the next year could impact the performance of Activision overall.

2212
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:54,000
So, so far no Call of Duty ghosts on Wii U either.

2213
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Well, yeah.

2214
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:00,000
So, and I think, yeah, it's a very big possibility.

2215
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:06,000
I think, though, it's less going to be, oh, I have a smartphone tablet I can play with these games on here,

2216
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
which no one's actually thinking that.

2217
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:15,000
But I think it's more of why do I need to buy a next gen console because Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out right then,

2218
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,000
or, hey, I want to play Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty ghosts.

2219
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Hey, guess what? Those are both on current gen consoles or Assassin's Creed, you know, Black Flag.

2220
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Oh, current gen consoles, you know, or Watch Dogs, current gen as well.

2221
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:30,000
So it's like why do I need to buy a new console for these?

2222
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:35,000
And they're going to have to figure out this whole what am I going to do with another console, you know,

2223
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
when I want to play all the old games and they're not backwards compatible.

2224
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:41,000
They showed footage of Black Flag on the PlayStation 4.

2225
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
You can't tell the difference.

2226
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:48,000
You can't tell the difference between the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 version of that game.

2227
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:56,000
I'm sure it's other like simulation like physics stuff in there, but I all know.

2228
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
I can't really tell much of a difference.

2229
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:03,000
I lost my train of thought.

2230
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Maybe first party games. I don't know.

2231
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:10,000
You know, that might help because, I mean, they're going to have some exclusive first party stuff,

2232
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,000
but that's what once again, it kind of sells systems.

2233
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
I remembered what I was going to say.

2234
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:20,000
There's rumors about this new Xbox, whatever it's called, that there's an HDMI pass through port on it.

2235
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Have you heard about this where, you know, you'll be able to save an HDMI thing because you can use the pass through port.

2236
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Wouldn't it be funny if that only worked with a 360?

2237
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Because they could do that, right?

2238
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:35,000
They could say, yeah, it's got an HDMI pass through port, but it will only work with the 360.

2239
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
It's an encrypted port or whatever.

2240
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:42,000
And a patch on the 360 will make it so that this is how we're going to solve the issue of backwards compatibility.

2241
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:46,000
You can patch your 360 through to expand the unit, but it only works.

2242
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,000
It won't, like you can't use the PlayStation 3.

2243
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
You can only use 360. Wouldn't that be funny?

2244
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Of course, they wouldn't necessarily openly say that.

2245
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Of course, they wouldn't necessarily openly say that, but...

2246
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
I don't think they could even...

2247
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:06,000
They don't do that. In fact, actually, they don't really have an encrypted HDMI.

2248
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
It's PlayStation 3 that does.

2249
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:14,000
In fact, if you try to do video capture through HDMI, you can't do that on the PlayStation 3.

2250
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
You can only do that on the 360.

2251
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,000
And I think you might be able to do it on the PlayStation 3 up to a certain...

2252
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Maybe not 1080p, but I know you can't do 1080p through HDMI on the PS3.

2253
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I don't see them doing that.

2254
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:32,000
It's still going to be very awkward with another console sitting next to your console to do backwards compatibility.

2255
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Just don't worry about it and just say, you know what?

2256
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
We're going to drop the price of the 360.

2257
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
You have a 360. You don't need to sell it.

2258
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
You can just hold onto it and play your games on that.

2259
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I don't really know.

2260
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
I'm sure they'll have a solution for it at some point.

2261
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:50,000
I don't see it as that big a deal because I'm not really going to get rid of my 360.

2262
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,000
I'll just have another console.

2263
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:57,000
mm2k in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

2264
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
I think next gen's coming out a year too early.

2265
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
You know, I'm starting to think so too.

2266
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:07,000
When these systems first came out, they started talking about this whole 10 year cycle.

2267
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I kind of think maybe it's too early.

2268
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
It might be.

2269
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:19,000
We may have a Wii U situation where it's just, hey, there's the launch titles and not a whole ton.

2270
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
I still think we're going to see some more.

2271
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:25,000
I think we're going to see more third party games, but I think it's going to be a lot of this.

2272
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:32,000
It's on PS4 and it's on PS3 because they're worried that, oh, we may not make up the sales on just a PlayStation 4 exclusive game.

2273
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:35,000
I think that's going to be a real big issue.

2274
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:42,000
You're going to say, well, especially if like if the Assassin's Creed thing, I mean, I'm sure it looks similar to the PC version.

2275
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Probably exactly like the PC version, but I haven't seen the PS3 version running next to the PS4 version.

2276
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
So I can't say that it's like night and day, but it doesn't look from what they showed.

2277
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,000
It doesn't look night and day based off the trailers.

2278
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:59,000
It looks exactly the same. But I mean, I think the trailers are captured off of the PC.

2279
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
So, you know, that's not surprise there.

2280
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:04,000
All right. Well, let's open up the Skype line, guys.

2281
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:08,000
It's the last we have on our list for the show tonight.

2282
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
But what do you guys want to talk about?

2283
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2284
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:21,000
I just got an email on my little emails from Joe from earlier in the show thanking us for having him on.

2285
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,000
So that was a fun interview.

2286
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:31,000
If you missed the interview earlier, be sure to download it on the podcast feed or check it out on a streaming solution like Stitcher or TuneIn.

2287
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
One of your favorite apps there.

2288
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Again, 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call and say hello and talk about whatever's going on in your mind this week.

2289
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,000
All right. Let's go to the phones. Hi. Here on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2290
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Hi. Joe Zaku here.

2291
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Hey, Zaku.

2292
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Hi.

2293
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,000
We see you.

2294
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,000
How's everything going?

2295
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Good. Good.

2296
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Now we see you in studio. It's like you're here. What's up?

2297
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Nothing much. Just catching up on some post Mother's Day gaming.

2298
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Dug up my old PS2 to play some San Andreas after like a three year hiatus.

2299
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Some classics. You know, my Grand Theft Auto 4 is still in the string crap.

2300
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
I can't believe you just called that a classic, Rob.

2301
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
It is, isn't it?

2302
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Have you not played Grand Theft Auto 4?

2303
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Don't say you're old. I mean, you're talking about like a game that's almost a decade old. That's kind of classic.

2304
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Wait, what?

2305
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Even like three and five city are pretty much classic at this point.

2306
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Dude, you haven't played Grand Theft Auto 4. Go play Grand Theft Auto 4.

2307
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:41,000
No, wait. I think I did a little bit. I don't remember. If I did, it was a long time ago when I first came out to play that.

2308
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Well, that one's playing.

2309
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:50,000
At the very least, if you're going to participate in the VOG gaming this week, you do need to play past the first few missions, I think, in order to get the multiplayer options.

2310
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I don't figure it out.

2311
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:58,000
I got really far in GTA 4 and then I lost my 360 copy, so now I have to start again for my piece, the one that I have on Steam.

2312
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Wouldn't it be funny though, Loki, if I started playing and I got totally addicted to it?

2313
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
It's awesome. It seriously is.

2314
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:08,000
I do like hoes. I hear there's lots of hoes in Grand Theft Auto 4.

2315
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
No, no, no, Rob, you like ho-hoes. Those are different.

2316
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Hey, you're calling me fat.

2317
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Sorry, Zaku. So you're playing San Andreas.

2318
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Yeah, just catching up on that and basically trying to juggle my queue, but I digress.

2319
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:41,000
I guess part of what I wanted to bring up was the fact that the whole next-gen issues with some of the folks who are a part of it, like Nintendo basically,

2320
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:52,000
bet the whole barn on the Wii U, and so far it's like EA's pushing back, Activision may, as you've already stated, maybe on its way out.

2321
02:29:52,000 --> 02:30:05,000
So it pretty much goes to the point where did Nintendo intend for this to be a Hail Mary because they were getting outgunned by the fact that the Wii was so far behind its current gen?

2322
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Yes, but there's a part of me that wonders if it's not a bridge console.

2323
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:18,000
And I threw that idea out because they invested so much in this gamepad and it wasn't just like the same type of stuff you saw on the Wii.

2324
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:27,000
I think if we had just seen literally a quote-unquote super Wii, it would have been more of a bridge console, which is what I honestly thought we were going to get.

2325
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:35,000
And then when we got the gamepad, I was like, oh, maybe not. But now I'm starting to wonder again, whether intended or not, Nintendo may have to.

2326
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:41,000
And I still think it's too early to say. I still think it's way too early to say, we don't know what this holiday is going to really look like.

2327
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Nintendo could put out those must-have games and sell fuck-tons of those consoles, and you may see new Xbox and PlayStation in hot water because they don't quite have that same thing.

2328
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
I don't know. It's too early to say.

2329
02:30:53,000 --> 02:31:05,000
On the other hand, you know, the word on the street is that Microsoft actually at the last minute, it looks like they're going to ditch the whole always online requirement.

2330
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Funny how that happened.

2331
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:25,000
It works in their favor in the sense that Sony basically was forced to, you know, since the fact that they went early, it makes it easier due to the fact that you spread all these rumors around,

2332
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:34,000
and then you create this atmosphere where, oh, we're not going to go through our competition console because such and such always requires Y.

2333
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:45,000
And then all of a sudden, they could just go in at the very last minute and announce, you know, all the things, pretty much dispel every rumor that's been going on for almost the past year,

2334
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:50,000
and they could pretty much be on par, if not slightly above, going into E3.

2335
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:53,000
They could do that, but they probably won't.

2336
02:31:53,000 --> 02:32:00,000
On the other hand, think about it. I mean, from what I'm hearing, it's pretty much the same, almost the same console.

2337
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:07,000
They're all going to be running Blu-rays. They're all going to have 8 gigs of RAM, although one of them may require more things than others.

2338
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:21,000
But if the rumors end up becoming true where they, like, ditch online, then that might just bring around some of the folks who are on the fence who pretty much didn't abandon Sony.

2339
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:34,000
But at the same time, they pretty much had the thoughts that, you know, if they had to go on and defend this lipstick on a pig by, you know, making sure, by defending always online, then, yeah, it would have been swayed to Sony.

2340
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:45,000
But, you know, if by E3, Microsoft basically, you know, pulls what they have to, and they could pretty much be neck and neck.

2341
02:32:45,000 --> 02:33:01,000
It's almost like an election where, you know, you try to blackball the other guy, you try to throw mud, and then all of a sudden, you dispel rumors, and then you do something, you do an event where you're pretty much, you're pretty much even in the polls.

2342
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:06,000
That's how I think of it. Like, the way I see it in certain elections where...

2343
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:11,000
So wait, you think Nintendo or Sony started that rumor about Microsoft always being online?

2344
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I'm thinking it's Microsoft themselves. I mean, this is coming from their developer, not only, like, you know, third-party devs that managed to get their hands on the early dev kits.

2345
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:32,000
And especially that guy, that product manager that, you know, opened his mouth on Twitter, that didn't help.

2346
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Zaku, here's the thing about Nintendo, Zaku, I am not willing to write them off yet until, because if they price drop at E3, the game is afoot again. It's a whole new game, level 2, you know, it's 3DS all over again if they price drop at E3, which is highly likely, I think.

2347
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:58,000
But at the same time, it's starting to shape up like a two-horse race at this point, with Microsoft and Sony.

2348
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:03,000
And the fact that, you know, Microsoft has to, like, improve their quote-unquote phone numbers.

2349
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Will it, though? Will it be a two-horse race? Because now we're seeing that, you know, people might just keep what they got to play Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty Ghosts and all these other games.

2350
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:17,000
True, but two-horse race in the sense of the next generation.

2351
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Alright.

2352
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:26,000
That's all it is. It's just like, you're right, there is an argument to be made to keep what you currently have in this generation.

2353
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Hell, I'm not even, like, almost half a year into my PS3 right there that my girl got me this past Christmas.

2354
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:43,000
So, you know, it's still fresh to me, knowing the fact that I had, like, my other platforms to juggle before the PS3.

2355
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:51,000
So, I'm still chewing on that. So, may I get, you know, will I be getting one of those new consoles? Not likely. Not yet.

2356
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Usually, I just wait a while.

2357
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:57,000
I will, most likely, because I'm a consumer whore.

2358
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Going into this next gen, it might be a two-horse race.

2359
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Alright, well, we will see. Let's have this conversation again after E3 and see what happens.

2360
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Speculation right now.

2361
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Alright. Alright, Zaku, I'm gonna let you go to get more calls. Take care, buddy.

2362
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Bye.

2363
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Bye.

2364
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Alright. I think, you know, he's right. It's all speculation right now. At least that part he's right.

2365
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:19,000
It's all speculation right now. It's way too early to say.

2366
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Talk to us after May 21st. In fact, I think, wasn't that the Memorial Day weekend where we were thinking about not having a show?

2367
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
That's, yeah, that's when I'm gone.

2368
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:33,000
You're not gonna be here. I don't know. We might have to do something something that week.

2369
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
I'll be here.

2370
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
It's not that night you'll be here.

2371
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:38,000
We might have to do something because that's right after the Xbox announcement.

2372
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:42,000
We got to talk about something. Even if Dark Soccer can't be here that night.

2373
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
She doesn't care about Xbox anyway, right?

2374
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,000
X what?

2375
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Yeah, exactly. Hi on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2376
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Rob, it's a trumpet.

2377
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Oh my God. Bobby's on webcam and he's actually got his cartridge. That's awesome.

2378
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
It's a trumpet, Rob.

2379
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Happy Mother's Day to you too, Mom.

2380
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Happy Mother's Day.

2381
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
What's on your mind, Bobby?

2382
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
I just want to tell you it was a trumpet.

2383
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
I thought it was a drumstick with you.

2384
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Well, that one, there's no drumsticks in anticipation. It's a trumpet.

2385
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:17,000
I think there was a drum. If I removed...

2386
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
No, because I would have played as the drum.

2387
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:23,000
No, no, no. Not the piece. The little drawings. Let me do a little drawing. Alright, alright.

2388
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:28,000
And when you put that game up to very hard, it's like, it would like draw one line and the computer would come in and be like,

2389
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Oh, it's an elephant. How did you know it was an elephant?

2390
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Because the computer always cheats.

2391
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Yes, so I always played on very easy and I whooped the computer's ass and I felt better about myself.

2392
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:45,000
And that's what it's about. It's about knowing that you kicked that ice cream cone into oblivion.

2393
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:46,000
That's right.

2394
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,000
That's right.

2395
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Bobby, I do wish you a happy anniversary of your hatching.

2396
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Thank you.

2397
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Ah, yes. I hope you heard the birthday embarrassment at the beginning of the show.

2398
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:57,000
I did.

2399
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:00,000
I neglected to say it on your show tonight like a fool.

2400
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,000
That's right. I was hoping you would forget.

2401
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Your discretion was appreciated.

2402
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:13,000
I was too hypnotized by the music of Professor Shy Guy who was fun on your show.

2403
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
It's been Kickstarter night on VOG tonight.

2404
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Yes.

2405
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:19,000
So, yeah, everybody check that out because of that.

2406
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
He's a great guy. I've actually seen him perform before.

2407
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:26,000
And he was the person playing when GLaDOS made me get on the dance floor.

2408
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Oh, okay. I remember that story.

2409
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Oh, and now that all ties together because I know he was talking about Ella McLean, who is a confirmed guest of GamerX.

2410
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:40,000
So maybe I will finally get to meet her in August at that whole thing. I'm excited about that.

2411
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:43,000
And then you can name drop me and she'll be like, oh, yeah, I remember him.

2412
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:47,000
I will absolutely name drop you. I'll be like, yeah, we're on the same network. Yeah, good times.

2413
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,000
And then we may get Professor Shy Guy at Dragon Con.

2414
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Awesome.

2415
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Or our thing.

2416
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:59,000
I know we've got a lot of conventions coming up. Are you getting excited about E3 only a few weeks away?

2417
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Not yet.

2418
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Not yet?

2419
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Not yet. It takes a while.

2420
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:07,000
It's like right before anything because right now it's like I'm getting all the invites to things.

2421
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:11,000
So it's like now I'm trying to figure out what I want to schedule and what I don't want to schedule.

2422
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:14,000
And so, yeah, I'm playing all that game right now.

2423
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,000
I'm still waiting to hear back from the E3 Pope, but that's my own fault for waiting so long to do it.

2424
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:21,000
But, you know, it is what it is. But at least we're going to Disneyland.

2425
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Yes. Yes. I've already got my plane tickets and we'll be going. Anybody else going to join us on that?

2426
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:31,000
It might just be me. I don't know. I would love to drag Dark Sakura, but I don't know if she's going to be game. We'll see.

2427
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:35,000
I will always go to Disneyland when I can, but I am the unemployed.

2428
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Here's the thing. It also depends on if I get blessed by the E3 Pope or not.

2429
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:43,000
If I do, then it will definitely only be you and me.

2430
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:49,000
But if I don't, then that opens up the opportunity that I can be like, hey, you don't have to sit around while I'm at a convention center all day.

2431
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Let's go to Disneyland for a day or two. So, we'll find out that answer this week.

2432
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:58,000
It better be this week. So, we'll see.

2433
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
So, I just wanted to tell you that it was a trumpet.

2434
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Plug Professor Shy Guy's Kickstarter as well as the Zelda movie Kickstarter.

2435
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Because I actually, the thing about with Joe, and I'm not going to give details or anything,

2436
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,000
I actually do know what he's going to be doing with the movie.

2437
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:21,000
I know the narrative and it's really an interesting take on documentaries is what he's doing.

2438
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:26,000
He told me that and then he later specifically said, don't tell people that yet.

2439
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Let that be a surprise. And I almost spilled the beans at one point.

2440
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:32,000
So, that's why I backed it.

2441
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:35,000
So, I actually have put my money where my mouth is if it gets backed.

2442
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
I think other people should back it.

2443
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:42,000
He's coming back up to Atlanta and I'm going to go down there and be a part of the filming there.

2444
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Well, apparently he loves Sacramento, so he can come back on the show when he comes in person.

2445
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Yeah, and I think he is coming. Like he said, Sacramento is one of the places that he may be traveling to.

2446
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
I will have to go check it out.

2447
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:57,000
What the hell goes on here? Maybe SacAnime is getting huge out here.

2448
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Actually, SacAnime has been growing and there's another convention that started up, I want to say in Rockland.

2449
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Yeah, so who knows?

2450
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:12,000
He's actually visiting actual people that did things. The reason he came up to Atlanta is because The Hero of Time was filmed here.

2451
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Oh, okay.

2452
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Those creators were here and there were a couple other people that were big in the Zelda community that, listening to his interview,

2453
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:24,000
he may have actually had to drop their involvement for legal reasons, but they were here in Atlanta.

2454
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:32,000
So, when he came into Atlanta, he actually was here to talk to three different Zelda fan groups that were all based in Atlanta.

2455
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:38,000
And he's coming back because the Symphony of the Goddesses is performing in Atlanta and he's going to do some follow-up stuff with them

2456
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:42,000
and do some more follow-up stuff with some of the other Atlanta people as well.

2457
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:47,000
So, he's kind of more meeting the people rather than really going to conventions.

2458
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:51,000
He's just now starting to go to conventions, but he also might be at DragonCon as well.

2459
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Sure. Makes sense. Makes sense. Alright.

2460
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Well, Bobby, anything else you want to plug or talk about while you're here?

2461
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:03,000
No. You guys may want to tune in June 2nd during our shows.

2462
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:06,000
For a little something something.

2463
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Dot dot dot.

2464
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Dot dot dot. Exactly. To be continued.

2465
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,000
To be continued.

2466
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
What would June 2nd mark the one year anniversary of? I'm trying to think.

2467
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:14,000
I don't know.

2468
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:17,000
I don't know. Alright. Alright, Bobby. Always a pleasure to talk to you.

2469
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
June 2nd, 2012?

2470
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Yeah.

2471
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Maybe the one year anniversary of that. That day is...

2472
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Oh, shut up, Logie. Alright. I'm going to let you go, Bobby. Take care.

2473
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Alright. Bye. Always a pleasure to talk to Bobby Blackwolf.

2474
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:33,000
He's always good enough to have us on his show every week.

2475
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
So, it's always nice when we can return the favor.

2476
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:39,000
1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

2477
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:43,000
I want to do Twitter topics, too. I'm like, where's my iPad? Where's my iPad?

2478
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Oh, it's in the iCades. Let me just get that out of there.

2479
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:50,000
You know what? You don't even have to lift that thing to get it out.

2480
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Oh, I always do.

2481
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Yeah. I've...fingers.

2482
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
You're saying I should just finger it a little bit?

2483
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Yeah, you need to finger it, Rob.

2484
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Alright. I will. I'll finger it next time.

2485
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Alright, before we get to last minute stories with Logie, let's try to take at least one more call here tonight.

2486
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2487
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

2488
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Hi, Akdeft. How you doing?

2489
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Really fine. And you?

2490
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Good. What's on your mind tonight?

2491
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Well, I wanted to just say that I backed up the Zelda Kickstarter.

2492
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Oh, hey. Hey, I'm glad to hear our show is helping and that it actually does help spread the word.

2493
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:29,000
What made you decide to pitch in and help?

2494
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Well, I already had read Bobby's article on VOG, so I pretty much had the intention of doing so.

2495
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:49,000
But while you're interviewing the guy, John, I think, he pretty much has a great idea here.

2496
02:42:49,000 --> 02:43:00,000
His project seems like a really, really interesting thing to do, especially for something that many people like, like Zelda.

2497
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:13,000
And something that he probably mentioned that really strikes me really good is that, for example, you're here because of video games.

2498
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:25,000
And one of them was Zelda. And you were inspired by video games to do your show, not to mention Bobby and many other shows on VOG and other podcasts out there.

2499
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,000
That is very true.

2500
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:35,000
It doesn't mention me that I do the I Love That Song articles on VOG. Video games and video game music inspired me to do that.

2501
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:48,000
So, yeah, I do have Zelda in part to think of that. So, I really want to see more of the fans rather than just the history of Zelda and its creation.

2502
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I want to see how people were affected by this game.

2503
02:43:54,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Now, of course, in some ways, I think this particular show, you would have to credit Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania a little more so.

2504
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:09,000
But, I mean, the honest reality is, would I have ever played those games or been into gaming at the first place if it wasn't for the great classic 8-bit games that kind of paved the way?

2505
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:12,000
I don't know. And certainly, Zelda played an influence in that.

2506
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:19,000
So, it's, you know, it's, I like to answer that question a lot, too. It kind of made me go, oh, yeah, it's true.

2507
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:25,000
You know, there is a lot of inspiration for what I'm doing every Sunday night that comes from games like Zelda and so forth.

2508
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:31,000
Yeah, and I really want to see this project finished or at least backed up.

2509
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Though it has a long way to go, but I think that if people understand what the meaning of this project is and not necessarily think, oh, it's going to be about Zelda and, oh, my God, they're going to prop it up, Nintendo, and do something wrong with it.

2510
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Or maybe the instant assumption that it's going to get shut down is a little bit silly, too.

2511
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,000
I mean, if it was going to get instantly shut down, I think it would have been already.

2512
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:08,000
And I think, again, you know, you look at something like King of Kong, Donkey Kong was a Nintendo game, too.

2513
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
And it happened. So, you know, there's ways he can do it.

2514
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:20,000
And he sounds like he's got his, what did he say, he's dotting his lowercase J's or whatever he said that, you know, he's got it explored with the legal team and so forth.

2515
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:24,000
He's ready to fight for his movie if he has to a little bit.

2516
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Yeah, I don't think he has any legal problems at least because of the material.

2517
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:42,000
So it isn't like he's taking explicit, sorry, Nintendo property to, for profit or something like that.

2518
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:47,000
So I think he's going to be fine in that sense.

2519
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:51,000
The fans, that's what I'm worried about.

2520
02:45:51,000 --> 02:46:02,000
But like I said, if they understand the meaning behind this project and understand what it is exactly, I think that it will get a higher response.

2521
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Well, you know, that's part of the reason why we had him on the show tonight to kind of get people talking and more people looking.

2522
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:14,000
And, you know, maybe even if just a couple folks friend the thing on Facebook and then share it with their friends,

2523
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:20,000
that's going to be exposure to possibly, you know, thousands more people that didn't see it before, possibly.

2524
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:24,000
So a lot of it is about getting the word out. So we'll see what happens.

2525
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:28,000
But I do plan on backing it myself, that and the Professor Shy Guy one.

2526
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:32,000
I'll give him some money too. I think that was pretty cool. So, all right.

2527
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:37,000
Yeah, that project too seems pretty good to back up to.

2528
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:40,000
All right. Well, Akdeft, any other quick thoughts before I let you go?

2529
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Nothing more. I sent you a Twitter topic. I don't know if you read it already.

2530
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:50,000
I am looking at it right now. But since you brought it up, I'll go ahead and talk about it with you here.

2531
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Let's see. You tweeted us and it says Skullgirls items for Team Fortress 2.

2532
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:59,000
They are up on the Steam Workshop for fans to vote and approve so they can be pre-order items.

2533
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
So what sort of items do we have to look forward to?

2534
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:06,000
They're basically hats and you know what, for TF2.

2535
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Of course.

2536
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:10,000
They're pretty cool. They're pretty well designed.

2537
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:13,000
It wouldn't be Team Fortress if they weren't hats.

2538
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:24,000
These items actually were rewards for the indiegogo they had for the DLC characters and the PC version.

2539
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:34,000
But Valve said to them that they had to approve first of the items and then see if they can release them as pre-order incentives.

2540
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Though now they have not a green light, but basically that fans have to approve of the items so they can be put as incentives of pre-orders.

2541
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:54,000
And also the backers of the project up there.

2542
02:47:54,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Alright. Well, check that out on the Steam store in the community section.

2543
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:04,000
And lots of cool add-ons for games out there. I really love how Steam has been expanding that.

2544
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:08,000
You know I love me some Mass Effect Civs in Civ 5.

2545
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Alright. Well, Act F, I'm going to let you go so I can get these other Twitter topics and wrap up the show.

2546
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:13,000
But have a good one, buddy. Okay?

2547
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:14,000
You too. Thanks.

2548
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Alright. Bye.

2549
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:18,000
Alright. I'm going to close up the Skype line for now.

2550
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Sorry if you didn't get through tonight, but remember you can always email us.

2551
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

2552
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Or you can tweet us and I'll get to last minute stories here in a minute, Loki.

2553
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
But first, I thought I'd quickly go through these Twitter topics.

2554
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:36,000
sj100matt tweeted us about ESPN ranked the best sports video games of all time.

2555
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Here are the top five.

2556
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:41,000
WWF No Mercy, number five.

2557
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:44,000
MVP Baseball, 2005, number four.

2558
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Mike Tyson's Punch Out, number three.

2559
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Yeah.

2560
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:51,000
NHL 94, number two. Yeah, that's a pretty good one.

2561
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Tecmo Super Bowl, number one.

2562
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Clearly.

2563
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Yeah.

2564
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Clearly. I mean, you can't argue with that.

2565
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:01,000
You know what? I still like Super High Impact.

2566
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Also, this list is badly needed. Now, I don't see if there was maybe a six through ten.

2567
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
There are no Blades of Steel.

2568
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Blades of Steel is not here.

2569
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Yeah.

2570
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:13,000
And NBA Jam, which I think would have been a worthy addition, is not here.

2571
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Depending on the version of NBA Jam, because there are some shitty versions.

2572
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Yeah, not the new one. Not the new one.

2573
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Well, if you want like the hardest home version ever, you want to look for the PlayStation Tournament Edition.

2574
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:27,000
How much is the original arcade version? That's the one I would do.

2575
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:32,000
So, okay. Very interesting. But I'm okay with Tecmo Super Bowl being number one.

2576
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Even though I don't play a lot of sports video games, I think it says a lot that I think I have played at least three if not four of the games on that list.

2577
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:43,000
So, I think that says a lot as to why they are the top five.

2578
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Some other tweets here from Tigerclaw. Defiance, the TV show.

2579
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:51,000
Tigerclaw tweets us saying Defiance was renewed for a second season.

2580
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:54,000
That shocked the hell out of me because this is a sci-fi show, isn't it?

2581
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Yeah.

2582
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:00,000
I actually downloaded the first four episodes to watch. I haven't watched them yet because shit's been happening.

2583
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
I think quite a few people have been watching it.

2584
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Yeah, I hear a lot of people talking about it.

2585
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:09,000
I did read over the Wikipedia article on it and it actually seemed really interesting.

2586
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:15,000
I watched on Netflix three episodes of Scandal last night, which has nothing to do with sci-fi.

2587
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:20,000
But I bet Nellie would watch Scandal because it's by the chick who does Grey's Anatomy, which I'm almost embarrassed to say I watched it.

2588
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
But it's pretty good.

2589
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Yeah.

2590
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
It's pretty good. It's pretty good, Loki. Scandal's pretty good.

2591
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I still want to know what the thing is with Nellie and her Tyra Banks obsession.

2592
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:33,000
It's not all the crappy McSteamy stuff from Grey's Anatomy, though.

2593
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
This is about, you know, this...

2594
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
She's on the last season of Grey's Anatomy.

2595
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Is she? Oh, is she?

2596
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:41,000
She's finishing up, yeah, the last season. Or this season.

2597
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Oh, this season is the last season.

2598
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
Yeah, the last season she can watch.

2599
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:50,000
One more tweet from Tigerclaw and this is about a Capcom promotion for Resident Evil.

2600
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Filling a pool with blood and gore.

2601
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Well, you know this came from the UK marketing department.

2602
02:50:56,000 --> 02:51:00,000
It was the first blood-filled swimming pool.

2603
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Good lord. It's going to have 55,000 gallons of water, and I'm using the little quotey fingers, featuring...

2604
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
With corn syrup and red food coloring?

2605
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:17,000
I'm sure. Fake human torsos as flotation devices, intestines as lane markers, and all kinds of gruesome objects floating in the water.

2606
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:23,000
The event is near London's Olympic Stadium, but not actually there. That would be weird.

2607
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:34,000
It will be... You can get the tickets for free on Monday, May 20th, but only 200 are given out each day leading up to the pool's opening on May 25th and 26th weekend.

2608
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Memorial Day weekend, although I guess maybe that's not a thing in the UK.

2609
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:41,000
If you're under 18, you need to have a parent.

2610
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Whatever. That sounds whack.

2611
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
You know what?

2612
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Really, there's nothing quite like bathing in the blood of fresh virgins.

2613
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Well, now you can.

2614
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
But only if it's real blood.

2615
02:51:53,000 --> 02:52:00,000
And it actually is really, really good softener for your skin, to say, and a facial made out of that.

2616
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:04,000
That would be concerning if it was real blood. This is just stupid.

2617
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Well, the meat market thing was stupid, too.

2618
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:08,000
It's just like, really?

2619
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Why is it always UK stuff?

2620
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:11,000
Really?

2621
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Because if they did it over here...

2622
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:18,000
I mean, no disrespect to our overseas friends, but y'all are crazy.

2623
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:22,000
You know that the Scottish diet was built on a dare, right?

2624
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:28,000
I bet it was Dutch influence. I bet it still had something to do with this. I'm blaming the Dutch.

2625
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
I don't blame the Dutch.

2626
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:33,000
I don't know, any place where, you know, blood pudding...

2627
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Where black pudding is served regularly, I don't know.

2628
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Alright, Loki, any last minute stories?

2629
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:46,000
No, unfortunately I don't have any last minute stories because I'm busy cramming to write an article that will be on the website tomorrow.

2630
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:50,000
And I just realized, hey, you know what, I'm not a very good writer, so...

2631
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
It's challenging.

2632
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:53,000
It is very challenging.

2633
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:54,000
I could be your editor.

2634
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:58,000
No, that's alright. We don't have time for multiple editors.

2635
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
It's write and send to somebody.

2636
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:03,000
I'll talk to you off air. There's always plans.

2637
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Anyhow, so if there's no last minute stories, then I guess it is time to wrap up the show, which is fine because it's about 9 o'clock anyway.

2638
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Let's go around and wrap up.

2639
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:16,000
Thank you guys all for listening and tuning in tonight.

2640
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Remember, if you like the show, please help spread the word about the show.

2641
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Give us a nice five star review on iTunes or a thumbs up and support independent podcasting.

2642
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:29,000
You know, there's a lot of indie broadcasters out there that work very hard at what they do and we really need your support.

2643
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:36,000
Not all of us can just snap our fingers and have people pouring money onto us.

2644
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:45,000
And I'm not asking for your money, but we don't have that luxury where we can do that and just have money poured onto us to buy promotion and other things for our show.

2645
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:49,000
We're not afforded that luxury in the independent community, so word of mouth is so important.

2646
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:53,000
So all we ask, we're not asking for your money, we're just asking for your word of mouth.

2647
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Tell a friend about the show.

2648
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Help grow our community because community is our motivator.

2649
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:00,000
And the more motivation we have, the better.

2650
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:04,000
Meanwhile, we'll go around and give everybody everybody's final thought.

2651
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:07,000
And why don't I start with you, Loki? What's your final thought tonight?

2652
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:18,000
My final thought is be sure to check out our VOG gaming night Thursdays, 8 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.

2653
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:21,000
I don't know if it's going to stay on that day, but maybe.

2654
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:24,000
I think that's the most convenient day. It doesn't conflict with anybody else.

2655
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:28,000
I know it's a little bit late on the East Coast and beyond.

2656
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:32,000
But this week, Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360.

2657
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:39,000
If you don't want to play that game on 360, be sure to go to our forums and let me know what game you do want to play.

2658
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:45,000
And we can try to work that in because I've been asking and no one's going to say anything except for Bobby.

2659
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Which is kind of shocking to see Bobby recommend Grand Theft Auto.

2660
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:50,000
But it's going to be a lot of fun.

2661
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Because he wants you to show off your elite skills. He's hoping to learn a thing or two.

2662
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
I'll climb some skyscrapers.

2663
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
I bet you will.

2664
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:01,000
My final thought is I would like to play Where the Fuck is Jamie Now?

2665
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Oh, but she's right here at my table.

2666
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:04,000
You win!

2667
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Yay!

2668
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Here, have some trail mix.

2669
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
That stuff is addicting. Damn you.

2670
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:09,000
I just threw it together.

2671
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:12,000
Damn you, coconut. I'm trying to lose weight, not gain it.

2672
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:15,000
You know what? The coconut is actually not very sweet.

2673
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:16,000
And super fatty.

2674
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
It's good for you. Eat it!

2675
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:21,000
It's a trumpet, Jamie. It's a trumpet.

2676
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
No, it's not. It's actually Reese's Pieces.

2677
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight.

2678
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:29,000
My cat is insane and she doesn't know what is right.

2679
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:34,000
No, seriously, I think that...

2680
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Is it a full moon or something? Because Midna has been completely apeshit.

2681
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
I have no idea.

2682
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:43,000
But I'm probably going to go home and get pounced again.

2683
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
So, who knows what's going to happen.

2684
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Also, I am doing a live streaming Mass Effect 3 with my really shitty but sometimes funny commentary.

2685
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:59,000
From 5 to 8 Pacific time on my Twitch TV channel.

2686
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:03,000
I need to do some streaming. I feel left out. Maybe I'll stream tonight.

2687
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:07,000
You know what? We should do a post-Hoard House multiplayer.

2688
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:08,000
That is...

2689
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:09,000
I will drink.

2690
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:10,000
That is probably a possibility.

2691
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:13,000
We should make Shane drink and I'll drink and we'll both be dunk.

2692
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:19,000
I don't think Shane is going to drink for another 5 years after what happened the other night.

2693
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Sadly, I think the archive video has probably already gone off Twitch TV and we didn't export any of it.

2694
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
But it was good times.

2695
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Alright, that's it guys. We're going to close up shop and get out of here tonight.

2696
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Thanks again for tuning in and supporting us.

2697
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:36,000
We will be back next week. Next week is the 19th.

2698
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
We will all be here next week for another show.

2699
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:42,000
We will see you then live or in podcast form.

2700
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
Either way, you chose to support us this week.

2701
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Thank you for listening.

2702
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Have a wonderful night everybody!

2703
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
See you next week!

2704
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Thanks for watching!
