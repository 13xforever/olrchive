00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,102
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've spoken with maternal people in my life.

00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:31,185
[SPEAKER_13]: And as has my husband, spoken with his maternal figure and her maternal figure.

40
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:37,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I called my mom, but we're doing Mother's Day stuff tomorrow because my mom is very much like, well, not just because of this show.

41
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, she would understand that, but I didn't take her out to brunch or anything because she hates the crowds at restaurants more than I do.

42
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:44,705
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, I don't want to go out today.

43
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:45,526
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too crowded.

44
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:46,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going tomorrow.

45
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:48,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know where my mom likes to go?

46
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,611
[SPEAKER_05]: You know where her favorite restaurant is?

47
00:04:51,952 --> 00:04:52,573
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so bad.

48
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,555
[SPEAKER_05]: You know where my mom's favorite restaurant is where she likes to go?

49
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:54,835
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

50
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:55,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Chevy's.

51
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:56,803
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

52
00:04:57,224 --> 00:04:58,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't I talk about that last week?

53
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:01,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't knock on Chevy's because they have actually a really super good salad.

54
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:04,489
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

55
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:09,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming up later on the show in just a little while, we're going to be talking to Joe.

56
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:16,517
[SPEAKER_05]: He is the creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone, which is a documentary all about the Legend of Zelda and Zelda fandom.

57
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:21,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can check out more about that on Kickstarter or we've linked it on Twitter and so forth.

58
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll link it when we post the show on VOG and OrangeLauncher.com and all that, of course.

59
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:25,945
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

60
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:42,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I've been trying to keep myself super distracted just because of all the stuff going on in my family.

61
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:55,641
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been playing Tomb Raider, I started Saints Row the 3rd, and then promptly turned it off because I forgot that I had left it running while I went to bed because I kind of passed out from four glasses of umeshu.

62
00:05:56,662 --> 00:05:57,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been doing a lot of drinking this week.

63
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:58,863
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you noticed.

64
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:00,084
[SPEAKER_13]: My poor liver.

65
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:05,687
[SPEAKER_13]: I started playing Ragnarok Online 2 now that they finally got the shit working.

66
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:21,572
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's so cute and there's like pourings and flips and they're cute and you can smack the shit out of them you start off the game smacking the shit out of pourings that's the best way to start a game and those little bastards thankfully don't steal your shit anymore

67
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:25,436
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

68
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:54,061
[SPEAKER_13]: and some of the job classes have been turned into like the blacksmith profession is actually now a job instead of a fighter class.

69
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:56,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of what they did in 14 a little bit.

70
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:57,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

71
00:06:57,844 --> 00:06:57,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

72
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:00,105
[SPEAKER_13]: You've held up your end of the blood pact.

73
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:18,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, now my blood is mine.

74
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:31,265
[SPEAKER_13]: I have also been playing a game called Off, which I am now to the first world after whatever Area Zero is.

75
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:38,106
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's weird, and I like it, except I wish I could play it windowed, but I kind of understand why you can't, because of how the game is programmed.

76
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:44,068
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it's very weird, and I suggest that everybody in the universe play it, because it's fucking weird.

77
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:45,148
[SPEAKER_13]: And...

78
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,818
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go ahead and count this in my gaming week.

79
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,480
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been rereading all of Homestuck.

80
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:58,284
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I've been actually playing through all the little mini Flash games and everything.

81
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,707
[SPEAKER_13]: To the point that I'm thinking about reteaching myself Flash.

82
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,311
[SPEAKER_13]: To do a few little mini games for VOG.

83
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:07,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, just fun stuff.

84
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:12,354
[SPEAKER_13]: I am also, did I say Tomb Raider?

85
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:18,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was playing Tomb Raider or Lara Croft's Really Shitty Day or what did Alan call it?

86
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:18,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Girl.

87
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:19,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, girl.

88
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:20,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Girl.

89
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:21,337
[SPEAKER_05]: The game, girl.

90
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:29,219
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm also playing Mass Effect 3 again because I'm live streaming it so that I can completely make fun of the game live on air.

91
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,161
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have adjusted my time slot so that I do not overlap Loki's streaming.

92
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:37,710
[SPEAKER_05]: or anything else on VOG, of course.

93
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:38,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, screw all that.

94
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,412
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm kidding.

95
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I have been... Oh, did you change your picture to Clue?

96
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:43,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

97
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't talk about what I'm doing on the computer over here.

98
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I like Clue.

99
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:47,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Terrible radio.

100
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:48,622
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Clue.

101
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:50,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I do too.

102
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:51,165
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to do like...

103
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,690
[SPEAKER_13]: An online tabletop RP Clue.

104
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:56,891
[SPEAKER_05]: RP Clue?

105
00:08:57,472 --> 00:08:58,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's like a VOG thing.

106
00:08:58,693 --> 00:08:59,434
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be hilarious.

107
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:05,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've been working hard on the shadow casting here in Sacramento, so if you happen to be local, July 27th, I'm playing Colonel Mustard in Clue.

108
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:06,381
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun.

109
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:07,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be fun.

110
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:09,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Please, there are ladies present.

111
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:13,549
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, tell us about your gaming week.

112
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:17,810
[SPEAKER_06]: This week I played, what did I play this week?

113
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:29,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Well I know I played Forza because we did the VOG gaming night and stuff and we've been averaging one extra person each week so next week, yeah, that would be awesome.

114
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:34,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week is going to be Grand Theft Auto 4 on the free roam because that was Bobby's suggestion.

115
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:36,635
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

116
00:09:53,289 --> 00:10:15,285
[SPEAKER_06]: and my hindsight I was actually going to loan you a copy if you didn't have it but I forgot to bring one so oh well so yeah we're going to be doing that and then yeah so you'll be joining in that'll be fun we'll just be messing around driving around you want to know what's hilarious about that it's still in the shrink wrap that sounds like games at my house Rob that is a crime

117
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:16,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Vagirator

118
00:10:39,774 --> 00:11:05,596
[SPEAKER_06]: um so so yes that'll be fun uh I finished also Call of Duty uh Modern Warfare 3 the campaign of that so that was okay and uh what else um I know I played some PC games this week well I played one PC game but you know I could say what it is but I can't tell you anything about it other than what it was

119
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned to VOGnetwork.com It's a game that's coming out next week.

120
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,755
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have to see what my opinion was tomorrow.

121
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:16,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I guess that was it.

122
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:16,782
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it?

123
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:38,195
[SPEAKER_05]: My game of the week, a lot of the same old stuff, World of Warcraft, obviously, because unlike DarkSakura, I still play an awful lot, although I've kind of learned how to have fun by myself in a while, because a lot of my friends are quitting left and right, but we still have the Horde House Guild, which is nice, because I still see some people on there occasionally, so I can at least be a little social, and I even ran random dungeons with some people last night.

124
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:39,756
[SPEAKER_05]: That I didn't even know.

125
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:40,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I just knew through the show guild.

126
00:11:41,757 --> 00:11:42,337
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had fun.

127
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:46,858
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've been playing a lot more PvP, which is kind of how I've been entertaining myself.

128
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:50,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know a lot of people are like, oh my god, I'm so scared of PvP because people are mean and so on.

129
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:52,419
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've just been having fun with it.

130
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,139
[SPEAKER_05]: And when people are mean, right click, ignore.

131
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:55,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And I never have to see their ass again.

132
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:56,519
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

133
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,720
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've also been playing some console games.

134
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,521
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the new games I've been playing lately, we got an email the other week.

135
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:05,586
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

136
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:28,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Best way I could describe it is it's a roguelike game, if you know what that is.

137
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:37,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a dungeon crawler and rogue-like is because it's like this old, old, old, old game back on terminal computers called Rogue, which was a lot of fun when I was younger.

138
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:39,732
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like that.

139
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:43,152
[SPEAKER_05]: You're kind of crawling around a dungeon and it's a lot of puzzle solving.

140
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:52,014
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be doors and keys and levers that open things and so forth and monsters you have to kill, but maybe they keep spawning unless you do this one thing.

141
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:53,395
[SPEAKER_05]: For example...

142
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,696
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

143
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:15,670
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

144
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:35,223
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

145
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:04,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Virtual console stuff on Wii U has been my other little obsession.

146
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:06,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Playing Mega Man, Mario World, Kirby.

147
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:11,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking forward because I hear Super Mario 2 is out next week, so I'll give me an excuse to play that again.

148
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:14,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what else is out next week?

149
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:15,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Big deal.

150
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Big deal, guys.

151
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Metroid.

152
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:19,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

153
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you already have Super Metroid?

154
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Super Metroid on an actual cartridge for that Super Nintendo sitting right over there.

155
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:31,089
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will play it again on the Wii U because it's an amazing excuse to play through it again.

156
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:40,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus it'll be slightly different coming through the speakers on the little game pad and TV.

157
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm all about playing Super Metroid in as many different ways as I possibly can.

158
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:47,968
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

159
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:49,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty much my gaming week.

160
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:54,391
[SPEAKER_05]: So a little bit of housekeeping before we get into tonight's news and our interview coming up in just a few more minutes.

161
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:57,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say, of course, if you're not following us on Twitter, you really ought to be.

162
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

163
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:04,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're also on Facebook as well where you can get the Fugle Question of the Week there and Google+.

164
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:07,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

165
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:11,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can follow us on Google, Google+.

166
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:12,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Just search for Orange Lounge Radio.

167
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, YYR in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, isn't Super Metroid going to be 30 cents?

168
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:20,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

169
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:22,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is only going to be 30 cents.

170
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:24,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And YYR follows that up with, then everyone should be buying it.

171
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:25,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

172
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:36,633
[SPEAKER_05]: If you actually own a Wii U and you have a way to pay for things online, I realize not everybody has a credit card, but you seriously should go to Target and get the $5 card just so you can buy this game.

173
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:39,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you get it quickly, you can get Kirby for 30 cents still too.

174
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:40,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

175
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:40,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

176
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:47,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Koopa Kid Jeremy in chatroom from Koopa Club, howdy, says Super Metroid should be purchased in every form.

177
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:48,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Agree.

178
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:48,979
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

179
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeremy knows what's up.

180
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,100
[SPEAKER_05]: He understands.

181
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:55,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Metroid greater than everything else.

182
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:57,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into some news.

183
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:59,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do at least one of our news items real quick.

184
00:15:59,443 --> 00:15:59,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

185
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for Super Super Metroid.

186
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:03,725
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that'd be funny.

187
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:06,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and I never got into Metroid Prime as much as I did the 2D Metroids.

188
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,987
[SPEAKER_06]: What if they did a Super Metroid 2?

189
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:15,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, Zero Mission and Fusion, kind of.

190
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,574
[SPEAKER_05]: More of a remake, sort of.

191
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:26,484
[SPEAKER_05]: If they did something in the Super Metroid universe on the 3DS akin to what they're doing with Zelda, I'd have a nerd boner.

192
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:26,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I would.

193
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:27,926
[SPEAKER_05]: How could you not?

194
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:31,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the 2D Metroids.

195
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:33,345
[SPEAKER_05]: The 3D ones aren't bad.

196
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:37,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoy the third game in the 3D series for some reason.

197
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people hated that one.

198
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And I even like the DS Prime Hunters thing.

199
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:43,652
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a cool little concept.

200
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:45,133
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same.

201
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:49,156
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get all Doom up in here with my Metroid, it's not the same.

202
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:54,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not bad, but I'm not as fanboy as I am over something like Super Metroid.

203
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, news.

204
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:56,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so...

205
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:08,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's definitely trying to get more indie games on their services, and one way they're planning on doing that is actually waiving the license fee for PlayStation Mobile.

206
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:20,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, PlayStation Mobile's on pretty much everything PlayStation, including Vita and PSP, as well as PlayStation Mobile-approved phones, whatever that might be.

207
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:23,199
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

208
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:45,576
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually find this.

209
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:47,938
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be available now.

210
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:50,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are featuring all sorts of games.

211
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the bigger named indie titles like Retro City Rampage, Papo Yo, and Dyad.

212
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:58,725
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of stuff.

213
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:05,550
[SPEAKER_06]: But definitely a step in the opposite direction than Microsoft is taking.

214
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that this could be in response?

215
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:20,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is a place where maybe they see that Microsoft is vulnerable right now having done what they did with XNA where Sony's like, hmm, maybe we should just kind of pluck that idea and implement it.

216
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:29,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think that they see a lot of popularity with the indie scene kind of rising up again with Kickstarter projects and just indie games in general, Steam Greenlight and that kind of stuff.

217
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:40,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if it's easy for people to bring that content that may be on PC right now to the PlayStation Network, then they're all for it.

218
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:44,979
[SPEAKER_06]: That's more eyes on the PlayStation Network and more reason to buy a console that plays those games.

219
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure Retro City Rampage, a pretty good example.

220
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:55,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Hotline Miami, I think that's coming or already out for the Vita and PlayStation 3.

221
00:18:57,951 --> 00:18:58,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of games like that.

222
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:02,435
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it's definitely good.

223
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Promote more people to come to your platform.

224
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:07,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely better than go away.

225
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:17,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, YYR in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, personally, I think the removal of the $99 fee is just because they want to increase the number of titles available.

226
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:25,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, certainly, you know, um, anything to add value to the Vita, I think is going to be something Sony is going to want to explore for real.

227
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:26,748
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hmm.

228
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:27,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

229
00:19:29,606 --> 00:19:36,930
[SPEAKER_05]: YYR also follows that up with Microsoft is actually paying $100 to anyone who submits a Windows 8 app through the end of June.

230
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that's Windows 8.

231
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,512
[SPEAKER_06]: No one wants to submit a Windows 8 app.

232
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:49,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back a story a minute here because this is something we neglected to mention during Metroid talk, but TigerClaw on chat says Metroid Other M was more of a direct sequel to Super Metroid.

233
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:50,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about that.

234
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:52,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people do because it wasn't developed by Nintendo.

235
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:55,260
[SPEAKER_05]: It was that whole Team Ninja third-party experiment thing.

236
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:03,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't hate Metroid Other M as much as some people did, but obviously I didn't remember it either, so I think that kind of tells you where Other M is.

237
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:11,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And Metroid Other M kind of sounds like... It was a weird title, too.

238
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Coca-Cola Classic.

239
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:17,087
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Un-Cola, or not Cola, I guess that would be 7-Up, or...

240
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:38,568
[SPEAKER_05]: titles are so important and I think a lot of times people kind of forget that I mean I get that they want to get a title that really conveys the message of the story of the game or whatever and I get it but there's so many more people that would have just been like oh Super Metroid 2 other M heck yeah you know I think I think that carries a lot of weight that sometimes people forget about anyway

241
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:40,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what else do I want to ask on the indies?

242
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:41,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to the indies for a minute.

243
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think this is going to be embraced?

244
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:45,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, do you, by the indie community?

245
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:49,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much Sony, but do you, do you see that people would be like, yeah, I'm going to develop for the Vita?

246
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:53,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know how easy it is to develop for the Vita.

247
00:20:54,099 --> 00:21:04,086
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know like a lot of those Kickstarter projects you see, you always see Wii U as actually a platform as, okay, my indie tile is going up on Wii U, which is kind of interesting.

248
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:05,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

249
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:07,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it couldn't hurt.

250
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:15,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if they are struggling with financing, then definitely removing that fee would help.

251
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:19,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully get more games on there.

252
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:27,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully that doesn't mean that's going to dilute the games that are on there with a lot of garbage indie games and stuff, but I don't know.

253
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:29,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about the little ding-dong, by the way.

254
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:36,290
[SPEAKER_05]: My Facebook thing decided to go off, which I hate that stupid beep-beep on Facebook.

255
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,251
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't turn it off.

256
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,813
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard what you're going to be able to expect coming soon.

257
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:42,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Autoplane video ads.

258
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:46,658
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just ready to leave Facebook forever.

259
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:47,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

260
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:54,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Dead Air.

261
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:55,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

262
00:21:56,425 --> 00:22:01,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I just completely am really... I've turned off every type of notification I possibly can for Facebook.

263
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:05,287
[SPEAKER_13]: And now they've actually started being able to bypass my ad block.

264
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:07,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in chat says you can disable it.

265
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:09,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I need to do my more research.

266
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:13,829
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll have to do that later because it is time to bring on to the show Joe.

267
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:17,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And Joe is a creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone.

268
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a movie that is a Zelda documentary.

269
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to try to get him on the line right now to talk about...

270
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:37,304
[SPEAKER_05]: This Kickstarter project and the movie which has a trailer which you can watch if you go over to the Kickstarter page and search for It's Dangerous to Go Alone or if you just search for Zelda movie you'll probably find it and you can see the trailer and check out what this project is all about.

271
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,106
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe Joe is with us right now.

272
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:39,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe, you there?

273
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:40,987
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, man?

274
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:41,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, how you doing, Joe?

275
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:43,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I am excellent.

276
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Just enjoyed a beautiful day at the beach in sunny Sarasota, Florida.

277
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:47,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

278
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:11,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, we're out in California, so I associate everything Florida with Disney World, and four of my closest friends are all at Disney World right now, but not me.

279
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:12,089
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hilarious.

280
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:13,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Not me, I know.

281
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,931
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're not here to talk about Disney, we are here to talk about Zelda.

282
00:23:17,431 --> 00:23:17,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.

283
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:19,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, tell us a little bit about your project, Joe.

284
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:21,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's...

285
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:27,638
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple years ago, I was actually with my production partner up in Baltimore when I was living up there.

286
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,419
[SPEAKER_01]: We were playing through Zelda 2 because we'd never beat it as kids.

287
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:46,345
[SPEAKER_01]: We just went on a mission and bought a bunch of alcohol and played through Zelda 2 and started conceiving of a documentary project that we could do about the ubiquity and cultural influence of The Legend of Zelda.

288
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:52,087
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of artistic friends who were either filmmakers or musicians or artists or writers or whatever that were all

289
00:23:52,687 --> 00:24:00,491
[SPEAKER_01]: We all grew up together playing those games, and it was sort of our first opening of our imaginations was through the world of Hyrule.

290
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:09,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it kind of planted a seed of an idea of, hey, that would make for a cool documentary someday, and all of our other projects are wrapped up or whatever.

291
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:34,325
[SPEAKER_01]: and a couple years later just I found myself in a perfect time to film that exact movie and I started putting the feelers out and seeing you know we did start doing some research started doing some legal work and found just a you know a trove of awesome people that that are you know legitimate artists and filmmakers and out in Hollywood and illustrators for Google and best-selling authors and all these people that wanted to be involved in that

292
00:24:34,665 --> 00:24:39,447
[SPEAKER_01]: were hugely inspired by the franchise, and we said, yes, okay, this is a really cool project that we want to do.

293
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:44,270
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's how it started, and it's been very cool getting it up and running.

294
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:55,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So hearing you talk about that and watching the trailer, would you say that this movie is less about necessarily Zelda and Link and the characters and the story, but it's much more about the fans and the culture?

295
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:57,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not going to say it's...

296
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:11,851
[SPEAKER_01]: it's void of talking about Zelda of course but it's definitely more about not the fandom necessarily but how it has impacted us in a cultural way in such a

297
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,123
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a profound way that it's hard to even estimate.

298
00:25:16,203 --> 00:25:22,768
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, you know, as kids, we're all playing this child's video game, you know, and our parents definitely don't get it.

299
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:23,929
[SPEAKER_01]: We're six, seven years old.

300
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:25,550
[SPEAKER_01]: We're playing this Nintendo game.

301
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:31,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, me and my best friend, we'd play through these worlds and, you know, all the way up through A Link to the Past.

302
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:33,416
[SPEAKER_01]: We were really passionate about it.

303
00:25:33,456 --> 00:25:34,357
[SPEAKER_01]: We were really into it.

304
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:38,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And that best friend that I had growing up with that game, he now works for the

305
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:42,425
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

306
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:02,205
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the cool things that they're doing now.

307
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:07,147
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of owe a lot of their art or love for fantasy to that franchise.

308
00:26:07,547 --> 00:26:11,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So what notes do I play on the Ocarina to unlock those big bank accounts?

309
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:12,569
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I want to know.

310
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:14,370
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an excellent, excellent question.

311
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what, that will definitely help fund.

312
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,731
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find out, let me know.

313
00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:19,732
[SPEAKER_01]: The film will do a little bit better.

314
00:26:21,092 --> 00:26:31,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I gotta say, you know, my memories of Zelda myself, Zelda, and specifically that game, was how I got to become more popular in elementary school.

315
00:26:31,116 --> 00:26:33,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, I got picked on... You were that guy, too.

316
00:26:34,197 --> 00:26:34,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I was.

317
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:37,279
[SPEAKER_00]: People would come to you and ask you, where is that thing?

318
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:37,879
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would know.

319
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:38,999
[SPEAKER_05]: That is awesome.

320
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,200
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel you, man.

321
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right there with you.

322
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:08,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is exactly the thing.

323
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:11,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here you are doing a podcast on gaming.

324
00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:17,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, if it wasn't for games like that, you might not be doing what you're doing.

325
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:18,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

326
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:22,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fascinating to look at that and where people have come.

327
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:25,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So why did you turn to Kickstarter?

328
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:28,447
[SPEAKER_05]: You're asking for $50,000 to fund the project.

329
00:27:28,527 --> 00:27:30,768
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is the $50,000 for?

330
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:33,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And ultimately, why should we consider backing it?

331
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:34,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, because it's awesome.

332
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:35,105
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

333
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:41,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, we're competing with, say, the My Little Pony documentary, which got funded for $322,000.

334
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:53,311
[SPEAKER_01]: For those people who aren't filmmakers or don't know, for those of you who are filmmakers, you probably know that $50,000 is a very, very small budget.

335
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:54,792
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a micro-budget production.

336
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:55,711
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

337
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:13,370
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

338
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:58,532
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually really trying to get some unique one-on-one personal stories with people like Howard Phillips who started Nintendo Power and the guys from Rainfall that did that awesome April Fool's Day trailer for The Legend of Zelda for IGN a couple years ago.

339
00:28:58,812 --> 00:28:59,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was awesome.

340
00:28:59,993 --> 00:29:00,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

341
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:05,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all people that we've talked to that either we've already got interviews with or they're lined up.

342
00:29:06,698 --> 00:29:12,903
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have way more footage than we're going to be able to fit inside of our 90, 100-minute documentary.

343
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:15,665
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to travel to these places.

344
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:26,909
[SPEAKER_01]: and sit down with these people and see what they're doing now with their lives and find out how exactly Zelda has inspired them and how they've maintained with the series as they've grown up and become adults.

345
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Their children are now playing the games and see their impressions of it.

346
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:36,233
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, we're going to be traveling a lot and a lot of the money is for travel.

347
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,655
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it's also for the distribution once the film is complete.

348
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:41,715
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get it out there?

349
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:45,376
[SPEAKER_01]: We could just put it up on YouTube, but that's not the kind of film that we're creating.

350
00:29:45,596 --> 00:29:46,836
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something on the big screen.

351
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:50,417
[SPEAKER_01]: The physical media, digital distribution channels, things like that.

352
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:53,658
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where really the money is going to be going.

353
00:29:53,698 --> 00:29:57,178
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, $5 million is a low-budget film.

354
00:29:57,918 --> 00:30:01,139
[SPEAKER_01]: $50,000, that's a micro-budget documentary film.

355
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:05,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I think we turned to Kickstarter –

356
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,223
[SPEAKER_01]: We really wanted to do a crowdfunding.

357
00:30:07,243 --> 00:30:16,008
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually got a couple of decent offers as far as people who want to back this project in more traditional terms like investment-wise or producer-wise.

358
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:17,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be awesome.

359
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:20,351
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the Kickstarter doesn't work out, we'll pursue those.

360
00:30:20,691 --> 00:30:27,315
[SPEAKER_01]: But we love the idea of Kickstarter and this being a project where we're not trying to appease investors.

361
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:30,296
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a project for the community.

362
00:30:30,316 --> 00:30:33,018
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a project that belongs to the community.

363
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone has a little piece of it.

364
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:35,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, awesome.

365
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:43,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of community, we have our live listeners assembled in the live chat room, live.vognetwork.com if you're listening live on this Sunday night.

366
00:30:43,504 --> 00:30:52,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have a question for Joe about this project, It's Dangerous to Go Alone, the movie, send us a question and we'll possibly read it and ask it of Joe.

367
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:54,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, lately it's just been a debate over what the best Zelda game is.

368
00:30:55,274 --> 00:30:56,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is that what's going on in chat right now?

369
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:58,418
[SPEAKER_13]: I side with the Link to the Past people.

370
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too, but I know there's a lot of... Well, you know what's funny about that?

371
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:06,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm of the same school, and just out of curiosity, how old are you guys?

372
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:06,827
37.

373
00:31:07,488 --> 00:31:12,414
[SPEAKER_01]: 34.

374
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:12,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're all... I'll be 33 in a couple of days, so we're all kind of in that...

375
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:14,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Age, where we grew up with all the Zelda games.

376
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:20,622
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious about the young people who started with 3D Zelda games.

377
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:24,186
[SPEAKER_01]: If they go back and play length of the past, do they have that same experience?

378
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:29,200
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing that makes me think that maybe they do, and we're examining this in the documentary too, by the way, a little bit.

379
00:31:30,342 --> 00:31:37,010
[SPEAKER_01]: There's as much excitement and anticipation for the sequel to Link to the Past as there is for the Wii U Zelda.

380
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:42,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really telling as far as how compelling that game was.

381
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:49,384
[SPEAKER_01]: and how the 3D element, it's awesome and the visual element's great, but that doesn't make the game necessarily.

382
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:52,227
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, a good story makes a good game.

383
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:53,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

384
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:54,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially in that series.

385
00:31:56,091 --> 00:32:06,901
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, though, that there has to be elements of gameplay that, you know, are just the right level of frustrating versus rewarding for your frustration to make it feel like you're...

386
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:09,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Cursing Like 10-Year-Olds

387
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:27,917
[SPEAKER_13]: You should hear me and my husband whenever that game gets broken out at my house.

388
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:38,283
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like... But honestly, I think that Link to the Past took the formula from the first game that everyone seems to have liked so much better and really perfected it.

389
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:41,364
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they can keep that going with the sequel, then I think the sequel is going to be successful.

390
00:32:41,784 --> 00:32:45,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you might see a bigger console release following suit.

391
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, that would be awesome.

392
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:50,809
[SPEAKER_01]: With the capabilities you'd have for a Wii U title...

393
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,317
[SPEAKER_01]: to be gameplay-wise more like Link to the Past.

394
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be really curious to see where they could go with that.

395
00:32:58,156 --> 00:33:04,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Bobby Blackwolf, who's always on before us here at VOG Network, he has a good comparison that probably applies here too.

396
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:09,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he always talks about Final Fantasy and that your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that was out when you were 13.

397
00:33:10,024 --> 00:33:13,507
[SPEAKER_05]: So probably with Zelda, a lot of that's true too.

398
00:33:13,727 --> 00:33:17,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, your first experience in that universe, definitely.

399
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,631
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is something that we're examining.

400
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:20,432
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually there's a writer...

401
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:39,877
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not going to talk too much about it right now you have to just wait for the movie but if we include his segment he talks a little bit about the difference between cinematic storytelling in games and video games themselves and almost creates two different mediums and he talks about how console games currently are

402
00:33:40,148 --> 00:34:08,632
[SPEAKER_01]: they're more like cinematic experiences rather than true game experiences and there's a really strong divide between the two and the more recent console games for Zelda and stuff and for everything have gone more towards that cinematic experience but a game like the sequel to Link to the Past will be back to the center is not the story the center is the gameplay mechanics and the story is almost incidental they still want it to be very strong but that's not the focus the focus is the game itself

403
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:11,886
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really interesting thing to think about.

404
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:17,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask you this question since I did bring up another franchise a minute ago that has a lot of fan passion too.

405
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:18,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy, absolutely.

406
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did you go with Zelda?

407
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:22,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not Final Fantasy, Mario, Samus?

408
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:25,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not another character that we remember when we were young?

409
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:26,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did you go for Link and Zelda?

410
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:27,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Zeldagaming.com

411
00:34:46,276 --> 00:35:12,488
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it's not just necessarily about Zelda but that's the core of it Zelda and why Zelda over the other franchises we just found that it was absolutely ubiquitous just everywhere and I mean Final Fantasy you could probably find the same thing for somebody who's in love with Final Fantasy myself I just again finally played through all of Final Fantasy 6 and beat it a month ago I played it three times the first time when I was a kid I never beat it

412
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:13,289
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

413
00:35:33,286 --> 00:35:38,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like gaming wouldn't exist in its current form had it not been for the original Legend of Zelda.

414
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:45,135
[SPEAKER_01]: It might never have grown into what it is without those early franchise games and I think that was one of the core ones.

415
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:52,400
[SPEAKER_01]: We all, at 5, 6, 7 to 10 years old, we all felt this connection to that reality for some reason.

416
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,700
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you had another question for Joe?

417
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:14,826
[SPEAKER_13]: I did actually.

418
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:29,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you also been exploring, since you're looking at the general, I guess the genre of that type of game as well, are you also looking at some of the, for lack of a better description, clones on other systems like Newtopia that came out for the TurboGrafx-16?

419
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:31,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Even Legend of Valkyrie was kind of the same.

420
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of.

421
00:36:33,379 --> 00:36:34,040
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a point.

422
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there's so much footage that's going to be shot for this documentary.

423
00:36:38,222 --> 00:36:42,145
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to really make some difficult decisions in the editing room.

424
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:45,287
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a point where we talked a little bit about Chrysalis for the NES.

425
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:53,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a different system, but what Zelda could have evolved into had there been another NES release.

426
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:55,694
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk a lot about that.

427
00:36:58,236 --> 00:37:01,498
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get too much into cross-platform mostly because I guess we're all

428
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:09,227
[SPEAKER_01]: You were either a Nintendo kid or you were a Sega kid when growing up, and it sounds like you guys were both Nintendo kids, so you understand.

429
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:12,050
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, this one was a Sega, very much a Sega kid.

430
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:13,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave the room now.

431
00:37:13,212 --> 00:37:14,574
[SPEAKER_01]: You're no longer invited to talk.

432
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:16,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, you're out of the conversation.

433
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:18,419
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she was a Sega adult, I guess.

434
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:21,782
[SPEAKER_13]: No, my husband grew up with a Master System and a Genesis.

435
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:30,648
[SPEAKER_13]: I grew up with my NES, and my brother's SNES, when they moved, I bought my SNES, and then my husband said, look, Sega Saturn, and I forgot everything else existed.

436
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,391
[SPEAKER_13]: And now my favorite system to this day is the TurboGrafx.

437
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:34,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

438
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:36,293
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's funny.

439
00:37:37,114 --> 00:37:45,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it too because it's so fun to see the people's devotion to their – and when I was a kid, I was – like it was Nintendo.

440
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:47,124
[SPEAKER_01]: F everybody else.

441
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:48,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Screw Sega.

442
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:48,805
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

443
00:37:49,826 --> 00:37:50,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't hear it.

444
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:54,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't believe – and the fandom, it's not just fandom.

445
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:55,672
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like your family member.

446
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:58,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Like someone is talking bad about someone in your gang, you know?

447
00:37:58,274 --> 00:38:00,417
[SPEAKER_05]: It pained me when I jumped ship to PlayStation.

448
00:38:00,818 --> 00:38:01,299
[SPEAKER_05]: It pained me.

449
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really.

450
00:38:03,402 --> 00:38:07,748
[SPEAKER_01]: You almost are offended when your favorite releases aren't released on your console.

451
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:08,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

452
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is Final Fantasy not on a Nintendo console anymore?

453
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:11,935
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?

454
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was exactly it.

455
00:38:15,218 --> 00:38:19,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Just look for the N64 demo and then you'll realize why.

456
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get to some questions from chat.

457
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,680
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a good one here from SSJ100 Matt who has a question for you.

458
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,280
[SPEAKER_05]: What's Nintendo's stance on the project?

459
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Have they contacted you or have you contacted them?

460
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:38,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I ask this is because I noticed with documentaries on a specific subject matter tend to get some type of resistance by the original creators wanting to have their own stamp on the project or have it told in a certain light.

461
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:41,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, well, and that's a really tricky question.

462
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:47,894
[SPEAKER_01]: We have tried to reach out to Nintendo, but, you know, I mean, there's literally a million people per day with a project to try and reach out to Nintendo.

463
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:54,002
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have sort of a second, like, a second degree contact relationship.

464
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:57,125
[SPEAKER_01]: with Nintendo Legal, but we haven't really gotten any word back from them.

465
00:38:57,445 --> 00:39:03,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately for this project, our project is not about The Legend of Zelda per se.

466
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:09,056
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not examining the particular artwork of the games or the stories of the games.

467
00:39:09,536 --> 00:39:19,465
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really examining how the public reacted to that artwork and how they responded and how it sort of gave them their own artistic appreciation for gaming or

468
00:39:20,308 --> 00:39:23,893
[SPEAKER_01]: spawned their love for art or creativity or music or whatever.

469
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:30,804
[SPEAKER_01]: In that way, there's not really a lot of legal

470
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

471
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:02,499
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a problem with Nintendo Legal.

472
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:10,133
[SPEAKER_01]: It would break our hearts because we hope that they support this project, but it's not going to stop the documentary just because of the nature of the documentary.

473
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:10,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

474
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:19,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask you this, because of course when it comes to Nintendo, the fanboys are pretty infamous in their passion for a lot of the Nintendo stuff.

475
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:25,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And somebody linked me a thread on a Nintendo News website where the project got some cold reception.

476
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:31,171
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you say to people that aren't getting this or think that you're trying to profit off Nintendo's IPs?

477
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:42,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, there's so much stuff I wish I could talk about right now, but I am unable to talk about it until the Kickstarter campaign is complete because of Kickstarter's legal.

478
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:48,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind if people are criticizing the take on the documentary.

479
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:49,004
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't like

480
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:58,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the people who think that we're profiteering off this project We're probably not going to see a dime from this project I can't really go into much detail beyond that

481
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:22,629
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will say that the profits beyond production costs will not be going to us.

482
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:26,370
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can say about that.

483
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:32,372
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the people who don't like the style, there's people who want to hate things on the internet.

484
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:42,995
[SPEAKER_01]: They see something, they're worried that we're going to destroy their childhood but for every one of those people, there's probably a thousand people that have contacted me and said, thank you for validating my entire childhood.

485
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:43,595
[SPEAKER_01]: That's

486
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:47,165
[SPEAKER_01]: My fiance can attest to it.

487
00:41:47,226 --> 00:41:49,986
[SPEAKER_01]: The first day I saw some of those negative reviews, I'm like, why?

488
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:51,307
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm trying to do something.

489
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:53,288
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll like it.

490
00:41:53,328 --> 00:41:58,449
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, enough people prompted me that, hey, no, man, you've got to finish this.

491
00:41:58,489 --> 00:41:59,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to see this.

492
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,950
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of made me feel a lot better about it.

493
00:42:01,931 --> 00:42:02,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people will enjoy it.

494
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:12,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, there's an old saying we have here at OLR, and it goes back to when we first got our first one-star reviews on iTunes and so forth, when, you know, we're paying out of pocket to do this show.

495
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:14,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes, haters gonna hate.

496
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:14,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

497
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,820
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they say.

498
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,861
[SPEAKER_13]: At least they're not telling you to get back in the kitchen.

499
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:19,582
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

500
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:27,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, if you do something that is successful, and if this turns out to be successful, there are going to be people who will just hate it just because it was successful, too, you know?

501
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:31,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Or that maybe they didn't think of it first, or that they would have done it a different way, or...

502
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:33,604
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll accept that.

503
00:42:33,644 --> 00:42:35,566
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be our story in the way that we want to tell it.

504
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:36,687
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope people like it.

505
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:38,069
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't, they don't need to watch it.

506
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:38,790
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need to buy it.

507
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,972
[SPEAKER_01]: They could bash it all they want.

508
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:46,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's a good amount of people that do like this idea and want to see what we're coming up with for it.

509
00:42:47,299 --> 00:43:04,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well let me ask you one more question on a bit more of a positive note and then maybe if there's one or two more from chat I'll try to squeeze those in too but what do you hope, on a more positive note when people watch this movie and the credits roll, fade to black what feeling do you hope people walk away with after viewing your movie?

510
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:06,316
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.

511
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:13,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hope that – I got a feeling that the vast majority of watchers are going to be people like our age that grew up with the entire series.

512
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:17,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the people that it's really sort of designed for and they're going to feel validated.

513
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:26,950
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to understand a little bit better this undefinable connection they have with that franchise and why that one above all the other ones.

514
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, why not Metroid?

515
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:30,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not Kid Icarus?

516
00:43:30,112 --> 00:43:31,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not even Super Mario Brothers?

517
00:43:31,877 --> 00:43:32,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping they leave with that.

518
00:43:51,793 --> 00:44:02,460
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I wonder if The Legend of Zelda has inspired people who work in the entertainment industry, be it in movies or television besides in gaming.

519
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you work in movies.

520
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:08,885
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got one Hollywood writer

521
00:44:09,443 --> 00:44:14,625
[SPEAKER_01]: that is very much backing the project financially and has agreed to be in it.

522
00:44:15,805 --> 00:44:21,427
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has requested that I not talk about that too much because he's got another Kickstarter campaign going right now.

523
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:22,827
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't want to split.

524
00:44:22,947 --> 00:44:26,348
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, we actually have some people in Hollywood that we'll be talking to in the documentary.

525
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:30,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, the people that work at Rainfall that did that cool IGN trailer.

526
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,270
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to be in it.

527
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And also some gaming companies that are more –

528
00:44:36,786 --> 00:44:37,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

529
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:58,808
[SPEAKER_05]: One more question here from YYR in our chatroom, and this one might be a little bit tricky, but it's fair based on Nintendo's actions in the past.

530
00:44:59,388 --> 00:45:05,871
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go forward with this, and Nintendo gives you a cease and desist right before you release, but all the money's been spent, what happens then?

531
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:20,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that... Yeah, I mean, it's... I can't say it's a 0% threat, but we've done everything to minimize that, and there's... Like I said, the US has some great fair use laws for documentary and filmmakers...

532
00:45:21,371 --> 00:45:31,680
[SPEAKER_01]: were pretty well versed in those and having done documentaries in the past and we worked with a legal team for about six months before we even considered that this was a realistic project that we wanted to

533
00:45:32,082 --> 00:45:32,822
[SPEAKER_01]: to attempt doing.

534
00:45:33,582 --> 00:45:37,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really, really, really working hard to stay on the side of fair use.

535
00:45:37,724 --> 00:45:40,805
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, in some cases that means we had to scrap some of the ideas.

536
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:48,767
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if they tried to slap a cease and desist on us, which like I said, I hope that they end up in full support of the project.

537
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:56,890
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if they tried, they really wouldn't have a lot of legal backing in the way that we're telling this story.

538
00:45:58,942 --> 00:46:00,503
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working really hard on that.

539
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:06,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I can never say it's a 0% possibility, but we're being very, very, very careful about that.

540
00:46:07,308 --> 00:46:13,592
[SPEAKER_01]: The best that probably would be able to happen was they'd have to say that this scene and or that scene would have to be cut from the film.

541
00:46:14,092 --> 00:46:16,894
[SPEAKER_01]: And aside from that, the film would be definitely still produced.

542
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:17,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

543
00:46:17,605 --> 00:46:25,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, when I think of a movie like King of Kong, which obviously everybody knows with documentary and gaming, and Donkey Kong was a Nintendo game, and that movie happened, so...

544
00:46:34,358 --> 00:47:00,653
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody trying to beat that score not to mention all of the other footage of Midway games and Namco other things in that too and I encourage anybody who's interested in doing projects like this to check out the fair use laws and see how they protect documentary filmmakers and things like that one of the scenes that's difficult is the scenes from the Symphony of the Goddesses

545
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:02,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

546
00:47:18,613 --> 00:47:44,812
[SPEAKER_01]: in the course of the documentary so you know there's things like that like yeah there's imagery shown on the big jumbotron behind the orchestra playing Zelda themes but they were able to grant us permission to use it there was just that stipulation so again you know um the the capturing of the imagery at that point was incidental it was commentary on the the music going from 8-bit chiptune to full-on orchestration and and because it's commentary like that I'm

547
00:47:45,194 --> 00:47:49,337
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really look into the fair use laws, you'll see how that works a little bit better.

548
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:58,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who's interested in doing a project like this, I encourage doing that and really studying it and getting with somebody who knows entertainment law before you try and take it on.

549
00:47:59,775 --> 00:48:02,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Joe, you're very passionate about this project.

550
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:02,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear it.

551
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:05,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell that you're a longtime fan of gaming and so forth.

552
00:48:05,941 --> 00:48:08,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really wish you the best of luck with this project and getting funded.

553
00:48:09,404 --> 00:48:10,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to say?

554
00:48:10,144 --> 00:48:14,909
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to tell the listeners one more time how to check out the project and what it's all about and consider funding?

555
00:48:15,649 --> 00:48:19,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, a couple more things I'd love to talk about if you can give me just a couple more minutes.

556
00:48:19,352 --> 00:48:19,933
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.

557
00:48:20,553 --> 00:48:30,221
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys go to www.thezeldamovie.com, if you're on a computer as opposed to a mobile device, there's a nice little 8-bit game that is the navigation for our site.

558
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,543
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of fun just to play through.

559
00:48:32,563 --> 00:48:36,826
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have, and you get to a windscreen, and you get to see two extra minutes of the film.

560
00:48:38,087 --> 00:48:40,129
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, if you check that out, that'll also lead you.

561
00:48:40,169 --> 00:48:41,590
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link there to our Kickstarter page.

562
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:42,291
[SPEAKER_01]: www.TheZeldaMovie.com

563
00:48:57,072 --> 00:48:57,733
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

564
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:45,464
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're going to try and make that available definitely for iOS devices, probably for Android and something that's a standalone Mac and PC game as well and that's not going to be like the 8-bit game on the site that's going to be a very unique digital experience inspired by the gameplay and mechanics of original Legend of Zelda games but resemble and look more of a contemporary modern video game so we hope that that's the way most people watch it that's how it's intended to be watched

565
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:52,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that sounds like a cool little extra, and I think I saw some rewards in the Kickstarter have to do with being a part of that game.

566
00:49:52,996 --> 00:49:56,537
[SPEAKER_01]: That game or the 8-bit game that's going to be on the site for the duration of the film, yep.

567
00:49:56,737 --> 00:49:57,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, very nice.

568
00:49:57,938 --> 00:50:02,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, best of luck to you, Joe, in the project, and thanks for sitting down with us today.

569
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:09,642
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I hear that our pal Bobby Blackwolf here at the Voice Geeks Network, who did a story on this before, might be in the movie.

570
00:50:10,803 --> 00:50:15,645
[SPEAKER_01]: He was actually out at one of our first filming experiences in Atlanta, and we're going back up there

571
00:50:16,169 --> 00:50:16,649
[SPEAKER_01]: in June.

572
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:20,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's been a very strong proponent of the film, which I appreciate.

573
00:50:20,872 --> 00:50:21,472
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

574
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:28,676
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great to know that as a fellow gamer and a fellow Zelda freak, that he supports the project fully.

575
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:29,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

576
00:50:29,796 --> 00:50:30,356
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome.

577
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:30,877
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

578
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:31,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we support you too.

579
00:50:32,017 --> 00:50:33,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So best of luck to you, Joe.

580
00:50:33,658 --> 00:50:36,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for... Now, where are you guys at in California?

581
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,081
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in Sacramento, California.

582
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Love Sacramento, man.

583
00:50:39,061 --> 00:50:40,762
[SPEAKER_01]: When I get out there, I'll make sure to look you guys up.

584
00:50:40,902 --> 00:50:46,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, my friend's husband went to school with the lead singer And I used to work with their old drummer's girlfriend So yeah

585
00:51:03,658 --> 00:51:04,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also a small town.

586
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,040
[SPEAKER_05]: No, alright.

587
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:09,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Joe, you take care and thanks again for sitting down with us tonight and best of luck on your Kickstarter, alright?

588
00:51:09,668 --> 00:51:10,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, guys.

589
00:51:10,189 --> 00:51:10,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you're welcome.

590
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:11,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

591
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:12,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

592
00:51:12,753 --> 00:51:17,641
[SPEAKER_05]: www.TheZeldaMovie.com for more information on It's Dangerous to Go Alone.

593
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:20,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, did you enjoy hearing what that guy had to say?

594
00:51:20,321 --> 00:51:30,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the only thing I was kind of combing through the rewards, a little disappointed to see that there's not a wooden sword as a reward, like an actual sword.

595
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:31,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Like an actual wooden sword.

596
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:31,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it would be that hard.

597
00:51:31,895 --> 00:51:34,939
[SPEAKER_06]: You just take a couple two-by-fours and slap it together.

598
00:51:34,979 --> 00:51:35,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

599
00:51:37,062 --> 00:51:43,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, maybe in the future, maybe you'll hear this back and think about adding something like that.

600
00:51:44,249 --> 00:51:45,931
[SPEAKER_05]: A little hard to ship, you know.

601
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:47,432
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true, that's true.

602
00:51:47,492 --> 00:51:49,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people frown on sending weapons in the mail.

603
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:51,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on with other video gaming.

604
00:51:51,977 --> 00:51:52,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching.

605
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:22,665
[SPEAKER_05]: If you cancelled a gold auction, you got refunded double the amount.

606
00:52:23,566 --> 00:52:23,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops!

607
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:31,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So people were exploiting this left and right to generate trillions of gold.

608
00:52:32,573 --> 00:52:37,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't this the whole reason why Diablo 3 clung to this always online thing?

609
00:52:37,277 --> 00:52:44,062
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about the DRM, it's about the integrity and the auction house, da da da, and then they fucked it up with this bug.

610
00:52:44,242 --> 00:52:44,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Womp womp.

611
00:52:46,084 --> 00:52:47,749
[SPEAKER_05]: So why bother with always online?

612
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:54,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess that's maybe why the PlayStation 4 and 3 ones are going to go a different route and not have to worry about that shit, right?

613
00:52:56,743 --> 00:53:10,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if there is any possible silver lining to this, Blizzard, in talking about the bug, said that just 415 players, all of which were sanctioned, actually used the exploit.

614
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:21,739
[SPEAKER_05]: And the real money auction sales that were generated as a part of this, all of the proceeds will be redirected to the Children's Miracle Network hospitals.

615
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:30,705
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had a legitimate transaction, you have nothing to worry about, but if you were one of these 415 sellers that sold the excess gold, guess who really got your money?

616
00:53:30,905 --> 00:53:31,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Charity.

617
00:53:31,826 --> 00:53:37,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I always hate that they always punish people that exploit bugs in games.

618
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,911
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're hacking, that's one thing.

619
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:42,033
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're exploiting a bug or glitch, that's kind of dumb.

620
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:43,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you should have seen some of these people, man.

621
00:54:03,423 --> 00:54:06,384
[SPEAKER_05]: You're waiting for these guys to get the banhammer, and it's kind of hilarious.

622
00:54:06,564 --> 00:54:07,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, Loki, you gotta admit.

623
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:10,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, a guy like that, kind of asking for it, right?

624
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:45,252
[SPEAKER_06]: and so they patch that out and you can actually get like banned or you know short-term banned for using these glitches in game like what the hell it it's a container that you can jump on how why should that be a bannable offense well it's just weird to me that somehow this really horrific bug was missed i mean this is huge i it's

625
00:54:46,272 --> 00:54:51,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it just kind of goes to show that even tying your game to online may not fix all your problems.

626
00:54:51,195 --> 00:55:07,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weird that you might have a bug like that and then sometimes you may have a bug that causes your workers not to drive their cars to work and instead walk up a giant hill and lose their jobs because they're too far away from... Oh, I have to be the Sims.

627
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:10,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

628
00:55:10,088 --> 00:55:13,751
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why you just cheat and give yourself the motherload code and buy a teleporter.

629
00:55:15,114 --> 00:55:17,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't do anything like that at all, do I?

630
00:55:17,976 --> 00:55:23,499
[SPEAKER_05]: But the whole point of at least the older Sims game, I'm not talking about New Sim City, but all those cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat.

631
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody cheats in those games.

632
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,400
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the fun of the game.

633
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,263
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why this New Sim City was very like to me because it's always online.

634
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,043
[SPEAKER_05]: How am I going to cheat?

635
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:34,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I know they have their sandbox mode, but it's not the same.

636
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:43,109
[SPEAKER_13]: The fun of The Sims for me was pretty much building my house and then getting all of the really dirty add-ons that people would make.

637
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:48,330
[SPEAKER_05]: PrinceBrightstar in chat, an interesting comment, it's the difference between single and multiplayer games.

638
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:56,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Diablo's auction house is very multiplayer, but see, that's where Diablo's in a weird place because a lot of people are like, I want to play Diablo as a single player game.

639
00:55:57,052 --> 00:56:01,933
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why I hated the online thing in the first place, is that it wasn't never a multiplayer thing to me.

640
00:56:02,353 --> 00:56:09,035
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, I think Diablo is more fun with more people, but I respect those that don't want to play the game that way.

641
00:56:09,876 --> 00:56:11,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Playing with other people is hell.

642
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:13,537
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what would be awesome?

643
00:56:14,858 --> 00:56:19,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it reminds me of, like, what was it?

644
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:19,719
[SPEAKER_06]: The...

645
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,921
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

646
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:55,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, there's a rumor going around, and there was even a fake logo out on Reddit about this, that the next Xbox was supposed to be called the Xbox Infinity.

647
00:56:56,652 --> 00:56:58,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

648
00:56:58,835 --> 00:56:59,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

649
00:57:00,076 --> 00:57:00,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

650
00:57:00,857 --> 00:57:04,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this is supposed to be a report from the International Business Times.

651
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:16,512
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was also supposed to be floating around in rumor land about an Xbox TV video streaming set that was mentioned via Wall Street Journal.

652
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:22,118
[SPEAKER_13]: But Microsoft is like, we're not commenting on that because it's rumors and speculation.

653
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:24,380
[SPEAKER_13]: And even if it's true, we aren't telling you.

654
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:25,720
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

655
00:57:43,718 --> 00:57:46,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Fortunately, the Xbox Infinity thing, not true.

656
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:52,200
[SPEAKER_06]: More likely is the fact Fusion, which would be... I still think that's a dumb name, too.

657
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:57,002
[SPEAKER_06]: It would tie in with all the site registrations that they have for Xbox Fusion or something like that.

658
00:57:57,042 --> 00:57:58,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So some part of it... Still a dumb name.

659
00:57:59,342 --> 00:57:59,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

660
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,083
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

661
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:04,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Xbox Infinity, that's just a ridiculous name.

662
00:58:04,486 --> 00:58:05,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Because how do you go from there?

663
00:58:05,628 --> 00:58:07,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Infinity plus one.

664
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:13,376
[SPEAKER_13]: At any rate, basically just talking about this for the sake of squashing the rumor mill.

665
00:58:13,836 --> 00:58:15,338
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not true.

666
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Getting your information from Reddit would be like me writing my term paper on Wikipedia.

667
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:22,605
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be correct, but you don't know.

668
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:23,706
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't know who these people are.

669
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:25,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I solve crimes on Reddit.

670
00:58:25,427 --> 00:58:25,848
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

671
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:28,410
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing wrong with getting some news from Reddit.

672
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:31,953
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as you back... As long as you... Okay, stuff leaks out.

673
00:58:32,153 --> 00:58:37,017
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine if stuff leaks out, but you have to have some sort of evidence that leaks...

674
00:58:38,037 --> 00:58:56,910
[SPEAKER_05]: a screen a picture on reddit is not evidence that is like that's ridiculous right any to be fair i don't want to make it sound like we're dogging on reddit i love reddit i'm a user i i you know i post on things and and so forth and it's been a great uh place to enrich the the warcraft podcast community has a great subreddit

675
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:04,134
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, you have to, because Reddit is a part of the internet, you have to be a little bit of a skeptic.

676
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:04,854
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be.

677
00:59:05,034 --> 00:59:07,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just an extension of everything else on the internet.

678
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Reddit's bad, but it's just like saying, you know, you saw a screenshot on some random website.

679
00:59:12,238 --> 00:59:16,740
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have nothing, if you have no, like, sort of evidence to back that up, you know...

680
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say you have actual sources.

681
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we know that the International Business Times has no fucking sources.

682
00:59:23,462 --> 00:59:28,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Their sources are fucking some dude that's in their department or some intern.

683
00:59:28,045 --> 00:59:32,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I was on Reddit during a, quote, lunch, unquote.

684
00:59:32,588 --> 00:59:36,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Or examiner.com is almost all user-based.

685
00:59:37,171 --> 00:59:38,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And Forbes is going that way, too.

686
00:59:38,972 --> 00:59:41,294
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the worst fucking part about that.

687
00:59:42,114 --> 00:59:46,455
[SPEAKER_06]: So they ran that story and they checked no sources or whatever, nothing.

688
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:47,636
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they ran it.

689
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Then everybody else ran it.

690
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:51,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody ran it.

691
00:59:52,117 --> 00:59:53,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what the fuck?

692
00:59:54,198 --> 00:59:56,719
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, these guys don't check their sources.

693
00:59:56,779 --> 00:59:58,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you just don't check your sources either.

694
00:59:58,939 --> 01:00:00,340
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just as bad as they are.

695
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a lot of those journalist sites that keep their tabs on Reddit.

696
01:00:05,441 --> 01:00:06,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they respond, so...

697
01:00:07,162 --> 01:00:07,622
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

698
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:44,208
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know when when our story got upvoted and all that on dig because people were you know seeing it on our site that's when it really blew up and it was everywhere and then you know it got got too far exposed but anyway

699
01:00:44,798 --> 01:01:01,176
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm saying that there's it's just they're not thinking and if all these sites have sources though it just makes you wonder how legit these sources are if they're taking reddit photos I mean I'm not saying it's bad that it's on reddit but just like an anonymous

700
01:01:02,197 --> 01:01:02,237
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

701
01:01:25,585 --> 01:01:26,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow.

702
01:01:27,368 --> 01:01:32,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the name Xbox Infinity, but that's about as far as I give this story anyway.

703
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:34,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

704
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:34,798
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

705
01:01:35,218 --> 01:01:36,881
[SPEAKER_05]: May 21st, it is almost here.

706
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:39,725
[SPEAKER_05]: For God's sake.

707
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:41,307
[SPEAKER_05]: One more show full of this crap.

708
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:42,926
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

709
01:01:43,927 --> 01:01:44,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even care.

710
01:01:45,127 --> 01:01:46,568
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm calling it the shitbox.

711
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:49,930
[SPEAKER_05]: We already let our listeners vote.

712
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:50,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Xbox Lube.

713
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:51,771
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the Lube.

714
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:58,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Or I'm going to build a new litter box for my cat that looks like whatever their new Xbox is so she can poop in it.

715
01:01:58,574 --> 01:01:59,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

716
01:01:59,374 --> 01:02:10,700
[SPEAKER_06]: What you need to do, I mean, it's begging for a Photoshop, but you know, Invader Zim had this alien race with the amazing fusion technology, and it's basically duct taping shit together, so...

717
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:34,198
[SPEAKER_13]: I fused this phone with a hamster they already did that with two gamecubes I've known people who have held computers together via duct tape and I saw a car that seemed to be held together by nothing but duct tape and chicken wire last time I was in Alabama I kid you not, the whole door PrinceBrightStar in chat says name speculation has always been a part of new console launches, remember the Nintendo On?

718
01:02:34,938 --> 01:02:39,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I do and I remember when they were just going to call it Nintendo or Revolution, remember that?

719
01:02:40,154 --> 01:02:42,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, technically it was called Revolution.

720
01:02:42,257 --> 01:02:44,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It was their codename for it.

721
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:44,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like Dolphin.

722
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Should have been Dolphin.

723
01:02:47,044 --> 01:02:47,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Dolphin!

724
01:02:49,587 --> 01:02:51,069
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be just a commercial.

725
01:02:55,755 --> 01:02:59,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Tyra Banks screaming and running from the dolphin.

726
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:05,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to go back to chat, we're talking about Midna's new litter box being an Xbox lube.

727
01:03:05,898 --> 01:03:11,799
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing is, is that if we got one of those, Dan would put it on the shelf and Midna would try to take over it and sit on it.

728
01:03:12,219 --> 01:03:13,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's what she does with our current Xbox.

729
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,160
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what video game systems are.

730
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:15,520
[SPEAKER_05]: They're catapults.

731
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,246
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a black shelf and a black Xbox and my black cat sits right next to the Xbox when she's trying to blend in and hide from people.

732
01:03:23,326 --> 01:03:25,868
[SPEAKER_13]: It is the funniest thing because you, where's the cat, where's the cat, where's the cat?

733
01:03:26,128 --> 01:03:27,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Green eyes, there's the cat.

734
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,530
[SPEAKER_13]: The Xbox is just on.

735
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:30,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Fusing with the Xbox.

736
01:03:30,732 --> 01:03:30,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

737
01:03:31,132 --> 01:03:31,792
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on.

738
01:03:31,832 --> 01:03:32,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

739
01:03:32,192 --> 01:03:32,433
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

740
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:39,654
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's yet another rumor about a set-tops box version of the next Xbox.

741
01:03:40,115 --> 01:03:46,616
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, this kind of goes back to the rumors where they were saying that, you know, there's going to be two different types of Xbox systems.

742
01:03:46,636 --> 01:03:55,699
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be one that's kind of like an Apple TV or, you know, something that's basically connected to the Internet always, but it has no actual, you know, media drives or anything like that.

743
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:59,840
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mainly meant for, like, streaming and, you know, Xbox Live Arcade and...

744
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:13,790
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually coming from an anonymous source that told the Wall Street Journal that this Xbox TV thing is in the works and...

745
01:04:15,962 --> 01:04:16,442
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

746
01:04:35,628 --> 01:04:45,114
[SPEAKER_06]: For people that don't necessarily game on the Xbox, or if you are gaming on the Xbox, the other half of your time is probably watching Netflix or Hulu or something like that.

747
01:04:45,634 --> 01:04:49,216
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would make sense that they're trying to integrate it even more.

748
01:04:51,738 --> 01:05:00,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Every Xbox, though, that's come out, they've had this advertisement for linking your TV shows and making it a hub for all of your entertainment.

749
01:05:00,883 --> 01:05:02,764
[SPEAKER_13]: It wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being accurate.

750
01:05:03,189 --> 01:05:08,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mind the way they've got it right now, but I don't like having to launch separate programs for everything.

751
01:05:08,912 --> 01:05:12,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of want it as like channels almost, if that makes sense.

752
01:05:12,674 --> 01:05:24,200
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just like, okay, I need to watch, you know, or kind of like how they do it, I guess, on the Wii U with the TV is, you know, okay, I want to watch...

753
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:27,023
[SPEAKER_06]: The Simpsons, or something.

754
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:39,053
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's like, okay, The Simpsons are on Netflix, on Hulu, and on Fox right now, or on Amazon, and you can pick where you want to stream that shit from instead of having to figure out, okay, well, I've got to go on Hulu.

755
01:05:39,153 --> 01:05:39,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit, it's not on here.

756
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:40,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I've got to go on Netflix.

757
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:41,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's not on here.

758
01:05:41,735 --> 01:05:42,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I've got to go here.

759
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:50,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll just show you where it's at and where you can find it, or if it's on TV right then, or you can maybe go one step further and say, okay, I want DVR that.

760
01:05:50,442 --> 01:05:52,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they integrate Netflix into TV, finally?

761
01:05:53,425 --> 01:05:53,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

762
01:06:15,425 --> 01:06:42,508
[SPEAKER_05]: going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Ranma says Xbox TV just like Apple TV but cheaper and less uppity hey well it might not be cheaper either Apple TV is pretty fucking cheap 99 bucks now you know what though you can just have a computer yeah build a $99 computer or just get somebody's old PC that they're not using or get one at a thrift store as long as it'll go online it works

763
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:44,142
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not as sexy, though.

764
01:06:45,123 --> 01:06:45,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine's pretty sexy.

765
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:51,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom confirming, yes, they did with the integration with Netflix on TV.

766
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:54,332
[SPEAKER_05]: They've also recently integrated Hulu Plus.

767
01:06:54,772 --> 01:06:56,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure on that last one, at least.

768
01:06:57,717 --> 01:07:05,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just had to look it up because we're having a seminar this week about video streaming and what it means for our business.

769
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:09,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically a bunch of people are going to be saying, Oh, it's so difficult.

770
01:07:09,996 --> 01:07:10,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

771
01:07:11,378 --> 01:07:12,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

772
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:13,321
[SPEAKER_06]: You can still sell movies.

773
01:07:14,662 --> 01:07:16,563
[SPEAKER_05]: XSEED Games, Pandora's Tower, Xenoblade

774
01:07:36,673 --> 01:07:41,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, XSEED purchased Atlas Online, and Atlas, of course, did what, like Disgaea?

775
01:07:42,078 --> 01:07:42,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't they publish that?

776
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:45,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they do a lot of those publishings.

777
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:49,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Atlas Online's a separate entity from... Oh!

778
01:07:49,804 --> 01:07:50,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Herp Derp.

779
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:50,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, good.

780
01:07:50,885 --> 01:07:51,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you clarified that.

781
01:07:51,926 --> 01:07:53,648
[SPEAKER_05]: But Atlas Online... Ranma said Wild Arms.

782
01:07:54,448 --> 01:08:01,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, Atlas Online has been purchased by XSEED Games, and they've now formed a new name.

783
01:08:01,992 --> 01:08:03,052
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not going to hear this anymore.

784
01:08:03,072 --> 01:08:04,913
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to hear Marvelous USA.

785
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:10,736
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be based in Irvine, and it's going to be all the employees from the former XSEED Game teams.

786
01:08:10,976 --> 01:08:15,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And with Atlas Online, I see, because it's going to be about enhancing mobile and online game markets.

787
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:21,701
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of more about rounding themselves out so that probably you could see like a Pandora's Tower, like iPhone game and so forth.

788
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:23,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so this has nothing to do with this guy, am I right?

789
01:08:23,422 --> 01:08:28,570
[SPEAKER_06]: The next Suda51 game, they've got... Was it Killer is Dead?

790
01:08:28,891 --> 01:08:32,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Is their next big kind of multi-platform release.

791
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:35,617
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, very cool.

792
01:08:36,457 --> 01:08:46,023
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's not like... These are two kind of smaller-ish companies joining together to try and step it up and compete more with the big guys like EA and so forth.

793
01:08:46,063 --> 01:08:47,103
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is kind of neat.

794
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:50,105
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't sound like there was job loss that came out of it, so great.

795
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:51,726
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

796
01:08:53,047 --> 01:09:00,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, in other news, we have, well, some very interesting news coming out for EA.

797
01:09:00,671 --> 01:09:01,192
[SPEAKER_13]: They have...

798
01:09:03,851 --> 01:09:24,145
[SPEAKER_13]: A FIFA exclusive license until 2022 Which I guess they're not hurting all that much if they're getting the FIFA games That's including the FIFA World Cup game and everything under EA Sports for the FIFA branding Also now, and this is the kicker, I would say

799
01:09:25,726 --> 01:09:35,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Disney is giving EA a Star Wars game agreement exclusive licensing for all of the Star Wars characters and storylines.

800
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:46,152
[SPEAKER_13]: EA is going to develop and publish the new titles for a core gaming audience over all interactive platforms and the most popular game genres.

801
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:50,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Disney is retaining the rights to develop new titles with mobile, social, tablet, and online gaming.

802
01:09:52,173 --> 01:10:01,118
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Disney, thank you for killing the Star Wars franchise by putting it in EA's hands.

803
01:10:01,218 --> 01:10:06,201
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to rush everything out and give us shitty endings and change the writing halfway through the story.

804
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:39,701
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

805
01:10:41,342 --> 01:10:41,822
[SPEAKER_13]: You might laugh.

806
01:10:42,783 --> 01:10:46,365
[SPEAKER_05]: EA owns your ass right now.

807
01:10:47,046 --> 01:10:51,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming to wreck all your favorite games.

808
01:10:52,209 --> 01:10:55,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I look forward to Star Wars, FIFA, soccer.

809
01:10:56,232 --> 01:10:56,712
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

810
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:59,735
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to use this as my wedding march.

811
01:11:01,796 --> 01:11:03,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Had we not gone to the courthouse.

812
01:11:05,559 --> 01:11:07,340
[SPEAKER_05]: You were going to literally walk down the aisle to this?

813
01:11:08,982 --> 01:11:09,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I was.

814
01:11:09,883 --> 01:11:10,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

815
01:11:10,363 --> 01:11:10,684
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

816
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:11,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to walk down the aisle, too.

817
01:11:11,885 --> 01:11:13,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Tiara walked down to Doctor Who stuff.

818
01:11:13,647 --> 01:11:17,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Because... No, she walked down to the Star Trek The Next Generation opening.

819
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:23,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I know it sounds weird to hear me talking about walking down the aisle, but you have to realize in a gay wedding it'll be a little bit different.

820
01:11:23,296 --> 01:11:24,678
[SPEAKER_05]: But I already have my song picked out.

821
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:35,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wish that we had a webcam on when you were playing Just Dance ABBA.

822
01:11:56,404 --> 01:11:57,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad we didn't.

823
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:00,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.

824
01:12:00,289 --> 01:12:03,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I inadvertently had to walk down the aisle to the song Week.

825
01:12:05,994 --> 01:12:06,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember that.

826
01:12:06,834 --> 01:12:08,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember your end.

827
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:09,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you should have.

828
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:11,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the DJ that was absolutely terrible?

829
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:12,596
[SPEAKER_06]: That DJ was horrible.

830
01:12:12,636 --> 01:12:13,816
[SPEAKER_05]: He played the wrong song.

831
01:12:13,856 --> 01:12:17,438
[SPEAKER_05]: When you walked out, okay, not the aisle, but when you were introduced.

832
01:12:17,818 --> 01:12:18,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

833
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:19,438
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

834
01:12:19,478 --> 01:12:27,761
[SPEAKER_06]: When we first walked out, when we walked in the aisle, it was supposed to be, I think it was supposed to be Sunrise Sunset, I think it was supposed to be what they were going to be rocking down there.

835
01:12:27,781 --> 01:12:28,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

836
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:31,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it ended up being like Week or something.

837
01:12:31,342 --> 01:12:33,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what the hell are you playing?

838
01:12:34,923 --> 01:12:35,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

839
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,751
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to say that your wedding was pretty fun.

840
01:12:39,752 --> 01:12:46,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will say that Chris Brown song that you have everybody dancing to, that's banned.

841
01:12:46,415 --> 01:12:48,176
[SPEAKER_05]: You will not hear that goddamn song at my wedding.

842
01:12:50,494 --> 01:12:50,794
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

843
01:12:51,815 --> 01:12:57,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, Ranma in chat says, Rob Roberts is going to walk down the aisle to its reigning men or something by the Spice Girls.

844
01:12:57,601 --> 01:12:57,761
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

845
01:12:57,821 --> 01:12:59,442
[SPEAKER_05]: How gay do you think I am?

846
01:13:00,003 --> 01:13:00,423
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

847
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:01,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Spice Girls?

848
01:13:02,165 --> 01:13:02,746
[SPEAKER_05]: That's totally you.

849
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:05,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, then again, I am talking about walking down to ABBA, but that's different.

850
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:07,190
[SPEAKER_05]: That's classic ABBA.

851
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:08,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Abba is classic.

852
01:13:08,411 --> 01:13:08,831
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

853
01:13:09,591 --> 01:13:11,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Spice Girls is getting pretty classic too.

854
01:13:11,813 --> 01:13:15,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what, if you want to class it up a bit, get lucky.

855
01:13:15,435 --> 01:13:16,935
[SPEAKER_06]: You just need to walk down and get lucky.

856
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:18,036
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

857
01:13:18,116 --> 01:13:20,718
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even really walking out, it's more strutting at that point.

858
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just walk down to the music from Tron.

859
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:26,829
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no, no.

860
01:13:26,989 --> 01:13:27,990
[SPEAKER_05]: The game has changed.

861
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:34,952
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you have to do the Wendy Carlos Tron soundtrack.

862
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:36,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no.

863
01:13:37,353 --> 01:13:38,013
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

864
01:13:38,153 --> 01:13:39,253
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll have blue lights everywhere.

865
01:13:39,513 --> 01:13:39,833
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

866
01:13:39,953 --> 01:13:42,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, somehow we went from Star Wars to weddings.

867
01:13:42,754 --> 01:13:43,755
[SPEAKER_05]: But all right.

868
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:45,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So Loki doesn't think this is such a big deal.

869
01:13:45,615 --> 01:13:46,035
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

870
01:13:46,075 --> 01:13:47,936
[SPEAKER_05]: The Star Wars games lately have been so bad.

871
01:13:48,936 --> 01:13:52,679
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the last time there was a good Star Wars game?

872
01:13:52,699 --> 01:13:53,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Star Wars.

873
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, The Old Republic, I didn't hate it.

874
01:13:57,362 --> 01:13:59,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it was a better single-player game.

875
01:14:00,264 --> 01:14:04,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the MMO aspects didn't work out so well and kind of flopsied.

876
01:14:05,187 --> 01:14:08,449
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can't stop thinking about that Star Wars Connect game.

877
01:14:08,489 --> 01:14:09,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so bad.

878
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, that was really terrible.

879
01:14:10,811 --> 01:14:13,133
[SPEAKER_06]: What about before that, The Force Unleashed?

880
01:14:13,753 --> 01:14:15,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some people liked the first one.

881
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:18,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It was supposed to be all right.

882
01:14:18,616 --> 01:14:19,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Alan's here.

883
01:14:19,697 --> 01:14:22,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to comment further on my music choices, Alan?

884
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:23,761
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just Star Wars games.

885
01:14:24,382 --> 01:14:28,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Force Unleashed, I thought, was pretty good, even if the first one wasn't quite finished.

886
01:14:28,706 --> 01:14:29,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jedi Academy.

887
01:14:30,027 --> 01:14:31,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Jedi Academy 2, I love that game.

888
01:14:31,308 --> 01:14:32,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to see a third one.

889
01:14:33,226 --> 01:14:37,488
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember Dan playing through Rogue Squadron, and that seemed pretty neat.

890
01:14:37,728 --> 01:14:39,788
[SPEAKER_05]: No more Star Wars characters in Soul Calibur, though.

891
01:14:39,828 --> 01:14:40,429
[SPEAKER_05]: You can bet that.

892
01:14:41,389 --> 01:14:41,949
[SPEAKER_05]: That's done.

893
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:44,650
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

894
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:45,531
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a mistake.

895
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.

896
01:14:47,931 --> 01:14:49,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Starkiller was an awesome character.

897
01:14:49,912 --> 01:14:51,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much the Yoda and Vader.

898
01:14:51,693 --> 01:14:53,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Starkiller made a great character in Soul Calibur.

899
01:14:55,114 --> 01:14:56,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll get another Marvel fighting game from EA.

900
01:14:57,557 --> 01:14:58,478
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC

901
01:15:20,461 --> 01:15:27,444
[SPEAKER_13]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, damage.

902
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:29,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was short.

903
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:30,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

904
01:15:30,265 --> 01:15:32,926
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a lot of weeks of just, like, nothing lately.

905
01:15:33,106 --> 01:15:33,986
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll pick up a little bit.

906
01:15:34,006 --> 01:15:34,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone's sleeping.

907
01:15:36,127 --> 01:15:39,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially with summer coming up, you would think... I wish I was sleeping right now.

908
01:15:39,528 --> 01:15:40,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm usually dead, though.

909
01:15:41,482 --> 01:15:45,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, aren't there usually like a bunch like late May, early June, like right when the kids get out of school?

910
01:15:45,746 --> 01:15:48,809
[SPEAKER_06]: There used to be a bunch late in June, but it's not the case this year.

911
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:50,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

912
01:15:50,751 --> 01:15:53,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Traveling over to Japan and checking out what is coming out over there.

913
01:15:53,294 --> 01:15:54,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've talked about this series before.

914
01:15:55,096 --> 01:15:57,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Muv Love, Alternative, Total Eclipse.

915
01:15:58,819 --> 01:16:00,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've talked about this before.

916
01:16:00,721 --> 01:16:03,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it like an anime or something we finally figured out is what it's about?

917
01:16:03,484 --> 01:16:05,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was like a girl groping game or something.

918
01:16:05,646 --> 01:16:09,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It sure looks like it when you see pictures like that.

919
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:12,113
[SPEAKER_13]: When they don't show the guy's face, you know it's porn.

920
01:16:12,133 --> 01:16:13,694
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some muv love going on there.

921
01:16:15,556 --> 01:16:16,517
[SPEAKER_05]: and then MechWarriors.

922
01:16:16,897 --> 01:16:19,039
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like based on an anime or something.

923
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:20,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I think somebody had to educate us on this.

924
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,641
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all the animes.

925
01:16:21,681 --> 01:16:22,221
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

926
01:16:22,261 --> 01:16:24,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Scantily Cloud Women and Mechs.

927
01:16:24,883 --> 01:16:28,485
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all the games in Japan that don't come out over here.

928
01:16:28,726 --> 01:16:29,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless it's Rayearth.

929
01:16:30,067 --> 01:16:31,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I have no problem with that.

930
01:16:32,028 --> 01:16:33,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because that's pretty awesome.

931
01:16:33,209 --> 01:16:34,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Mechs are awesome.

932
01:16:34,049 --> 01:16:35,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Women are awesome.

933
01:16:35,851 --> 01:16:38,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob Coffee in chat says it's a visual novel.

934
01:16:39,093 --> 01:16:40,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Visual novel's not so awesome.

935
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:42,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop.

936
01:16:42,656 --> 01:16:42,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

937
01:16:43,496 --> 01:16:46,838
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Xbox 360, also, uh, MovLove is there as well.

938
01:16:46,878 --> 01:16:50,821
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, that's in regular, limited edition, and Famitsu Deluxe Pack.

939
01:16:52,361 --> 01:16:54,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming Famitsu's gonna give it a 40, right?

940
01:16:54,763 --> 01:16:55,263
[SPEAKER_05]: No, probably not.

941
01:16:56,024 --> 01:16:57,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, moving on to the PlayStation Vita.

942
01:16:57,665 --> 01:17:00,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing this week, but there will be a new BlazBlue pretty soon.

943
01:17:00,306 --> 01:17:01,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that a price reduction?

944
01:17:01,887 --> 01:17:02,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, that's a price reduction.

945
01:17:03,254 --> 01:17:04,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Why can't we get any more Tokimeki?

946
01:17:05,435 --> 01:17:05,735
[SPEAKER_13]: You know?

947
01:17:05,975 --> 01:17:07,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Good old-fashioned dating sims.

948
01:17:07,276 --> 01:17:08,456
[SPEAKER_05]: You should write your congressperson.

949
01:17:08,676 --> 01:17:11,238
[SPEAKER_06]: They have visual novels coming out from AXIS Games.

950
01:17:11,338 --> 01:17:18,801
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of the... I don't remember which series it is now, but they've done a couple on PSP and they keep putting them out on PSP.

951
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:25,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Rama from our friends at Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays on VOG, says, Loki, you shut your whore mouth.

952
01:17:25,504 --> 01:17:27,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all anime is boobs and ass.

953
01:17:28,765 --> 01:17:29,606
[SPEAKER_05]: All the good ones, though.

954
01:17:32,045 --> 01:17:35,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, there's lots of good anime out there that isn't boobs and ass.

955
01:17:36,056 --> 01:17:36,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Pokemon.

956
01:17:36,839 --> 01:17:38,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say it was all boobs and ass.

957
01:17:38,624 --> 01:17:40,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I said it was boobs and ass and mechs.

958
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:42,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Summon Knight 5

959
01:18:11,041 --> 01:18:12,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

960
01:18:31,636 --> 01:18:32,276
[SPEAKER_13]: They have crumpets.

961
01:18:32,376 --> 01:18:32,716
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm kidding.

962
01:18:33,277 --> 01:18:34,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, they do, but still.

963
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:37,619
[SPEAKER_13]: On the 14th of May, we have Dust 514.

964
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:41,842
[SPEAKER_13]: On the 15th, we have Sanctum 2 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360.

965
01:18:42,462 --> 01:18:48,426
[SPEAKER_13]: On the 16th, Frozen sign-ups for iPad and the Starship Damre on 3DS.

966
01:18:48,886 --> 01:18:54,150
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the 17th, Metro Last Delight for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

967
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:56,131
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is all.

968
01:18:57,168 --> 01:19:00,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

969
01:19:00,092 --> 01:19:01,033
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, Loki.

970
01:19:01,493 --> 01:19:03,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

971
01:19:03,195 --> 01:19:04,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Silicon Knights.

972
01:19:05,398 --> 01:19:09,984
[SPEAKER_06]: You may remember them for Too Human and a bunch of other games.

973
01:19:10,064 --> 01:19:11,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember them for Too Human.

974
01:19:11,886 --> 01:19:12,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

975
01:19:12,967 --> 01:19:16,588
[SPEAKER_06]: They have closed their doors, or closed their offices.

976
01:19:16,649 --> 01:19:21,991
[SPEAKER_06]: They have emptied out their offices and unloaded some of their properties.

977
01:19:22,511 --> 01:19:30,374
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, unloading some assets from Eternal Darkness, I want to believe, to the Shadows of the Eternal Kickstarter there.

978
01:19:30,794 --> 01:19:32,895
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've actually got assets down for their new game.

979
01:19:33,295 --> 01:19:42,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, they are still arguing with, uh, Epic Games over two humans still, if you can believe that.

980
01:19:42,881 --> 01:19:43,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how long ago?

981
01:19:43,881 --> 01:19:43,861
2008?

982
01:19:43,901 --> 01:19:47,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, jeez.

983
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:49,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it up already.

984
01:19:49,324 --> 01:19:50,305
[SPEAKER_06]: You haven't won yet.

985
01:19:51,205 --> 01:19:52,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, five whole years ago.

986
01:19:52,446 --> 01:19:52,606
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

987
01:19:53,266 --> 01:19:53,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

988
01:19:53,787 --> 01:19:54,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Five whole years ago.

989
01:19:54,447 --> 01:20:00,190
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still fighting them, even though I remember the last thing that they... The last, uh...

990
01:20:02,072 --> 01:20:07,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say the last settlement in the judgment was that they owed even more or something now.

991
01:20:07,837 --> 01:20:08,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

992
01:20:09,098 --> 01:20:17,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, $4.45 million going to Epic Games and still they're fighting it.

993
01:20:22,303 --> 01:20:22,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

994
01:20:37,837 --> 01:20:47,407
[SPEAKER_05]: This is being made by BlueStacks, and you can play mobile games on your TV with this little device using the controller, an iPhone or an Android smartphone.

995
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:53,954
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's where it's different than, say, the Ouya, which is probably the first thing that pops into your mind, which is very similar, or something like GameStick.

996
01:20:55,316 --> 01:20:57,958
[SPEAKER_05]: The subscription model is like Netflix here.

997
01:20:58,519 --> 01:20:58,879
[SPEAKER_05]: For $7 a month...

998
01:21:00,741 --> 01:21:02,202
[SPEAKER_05]: GameTap GameTap GameTap

999
01:21:20,857 --> 01:21:46,080
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, yeah, very interesting Also, if you pre-order the console this month, you get it for free As long as you are doing a paid subscription to the service There is no commitment or contract The only little catch is that you have to return the console If you cancel your service within one year But as long as you're willing to do, what, 12 payments of $7 You would get a year's worth of games in the console

1000
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:46,820
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1001
01:22:03,769 --> 01:22:04,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1002
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:49,876
[SPEAKER_06]: but that's the only thing that seems kind of unappealing to me because if you really wanted to do that and I know that you can say the same argument about the OUYA and stuff but you can get like an HDMI cable for your phone for like less than 30 bucks and plug your phone into your TV but there's the whole fact that you get 500 games now Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Action 52 had 52 games in it and how many of those were good well but one of them wasn't Angry Birds

1003
01:22:52,366 --> 01:22:59,121
[SPEAKER_05]: There might be a couple gems amongst, I'm sure, a lot of throwaway games here, but there might be some good stuff.

1004
01:22:59,796 --> 01:23:00,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an interesting idea.

1005
01:23:04,139 --> 01:23:07,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think we're not that far away from Xbox or PlayStation?

1006
01:23:07,341 --> 01:23:10,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hell, PlayStation Plus is kind of like this.

1007
01:23:10,384 --> 01:23:18,769
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been saying already that the new Xbox is going to be focusing a lot on free-to-play stuff.

1008
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:25,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably because it makes sense, because if free-to-play, you can avoid piracy, because who cares?

1009
01:23:26,235 --> 01:23:29,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Pirate it, more copies are out there, and you make all your money in DLC.

1010
01:23:30,637 --> 01:23:30,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1011
01:23:32,698 --> 01:23:35,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all right if they don't make it ridiculous.

1012
01:23:35,259 --> 01:23:35,780
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1013
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:36,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1014
01:23:38,061 --> 01:23:38,361
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1015
01:23:38,661 --> 01:23:48,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's take a trip back in time to a time when you didn't have any of this subscription fees to play a game or anything like that.

1016
01:23:48,845 --> 01:23:50,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless you had Satellaview.

1017
01:23:50,746 --> 01:23:51,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

1018
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,947
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this game might go before that.

1019
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:53,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1020
01:23:53,767 --> 01:23:55,048
[SPEAKER_13]: No, this came well after that.

1021
01:23:55,228 --> 01:23:55,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1022
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:55,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1023
01:23:55,808 --> 01:24:01,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're going to take a trip back in time then just a little bit to a classic video game that DarkSakura has picked for us.

1024
01:24:01,532 --> 01:24:07,256
[SPEAKER_05]: She's jumped into the vault and said, hey, ungrateful kids, play this game this week and respect gaming.

1025
01:24:07,556 --> 01:24:08,997
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1026
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,859
[SPEAKER_13]: I picked the Neon Genesis Evangelion game for Nintendo 64.

1027
01:24:13,981 --> 01:24:38,937
[SPEAKER_13]: it actually out of all of those games that's come out like the Saturn games and the other ones this one has to probably be my favorite it was really fun as far as it going through the entire series with the various battles and everything it was based pretty directly on the TV series and actually went into events for End of Evangelion

1028
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:52,630
[SPEAKER_13]: So you had 13 missions that were basically focused on each of the angels going up to the... In fact, this scene that I've linked here is the Mission 12 where you go against the Ava series.

1029
01:24:53,611 --> 01:25:00,217
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in 13 are the other... Yeah, I went up through 13 levels.

1030
01:25:00,237 --> 01:25:00,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1031
01:25:01,278 --> 01:25:26,969
[SPEAKER_13]: so basically this is just a retelling of the series but it's one that you participate in you play as the various pilots in the game there's even like this one right here is probably my favorite part in the entire series where Asuka gets her big I'm gonna kick everybody's ass moment oh wait I'm no longer in a coma it was really really freaking well done for something on the Nintendo 64 I just had to say

1032
01:25:28,807 --> 01:25:33,330
[SPEAKER_13]: So really, there's not that much to say about it.

1033
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:38,253
[SPEAKER_13]: It's that you basically control the weapons as they go.

1034
01:25:38,553 --> 01:25:47,039
[SPEAKER_13]: You have cinematic attacks, you have actions, you have a different type of gameplay that goes through.

1035
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:50,661
[SPEAKER_13]: You're sort of in a 3D, 2D course where you can walk back and forth.

1036
01:25:51,962 --> 01:25:56,865
[SPEAKER_13]: But it pretty much has to do with just pressing the right commands to do the cinematic attacks.

1037
01:25:57,225 --> 01:26:19,278
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean that's really the basis of it and then in the end you have like a free-for-all you're still in that that 3d 2d sort of movie you can move more freely and that's used in missions 12 through 13 you also have parts that are outside the missions like a training mode that's called simulation you have

1038
01:26:21,019 --> 01:26:21,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1039
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:39,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Simple.

1040
01:26:41,004 --> 01:26:42,825
[SPEAKER_13]: It's freaking Evangelion.

1041
01:26:42,845 --> 01:26:44,266
[SPEAKER_13]: You're playing the episodes.

1042
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:47,427
[SPEAKER_13]: And this one, to me, was the best of them.

1043
01:26:48,168 --> 01:26:55,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because it had more of that action element to it and less of the whole, as I was calling the Saturn ones, datesome Evangelion.

1044
01:26:56,792 --> 01:26:59,854
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a good game.

1045
01:27:00,534 --> 01:27:02,115
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the best of the lot.

1046
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:06,017
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that for anyone who's a fan of this series, you should definitely give it a try.

1047
01:27:06,428 --> 01:27:08,349
[SPEAKER_05]: For a Nintendo 64 game, it looks really good, too.

1048
01:27:08,449 --> 01:27:09,089
[SPEAKER_13]: It does.

1049
01:27:09,309 --> 01:27:16,793
[SPEAKER_13]: This was, if I remember correctly, this is one of the games that was released during the later part of the Nintendo 64's life.

1050
01:27:17,413 --> 01:27:24,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I remember, I think that I first played this when I had a Dreamcast.

1051
01:27:25,617 --> 01:27:31,280
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that one of my friends bought this and that's how I played it, but this is on my list of things to eventually pick up.

1052
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,361
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a really, really fun game.

1053
01:27:34,508 --> 01:27:43,275
[SPEAKER_13]: And, I mean, really, since it's Nintendo 64, I'm throwing it on the list because, I mean, I really can't say enough good things about it.

1054
01:27:43,395 --> 01:27:49,539
[SPEAKER_13]: It may seem kind of, you know, dated now, but for its day, it was pretty nice graphics and really good gameplay.

1055
01:27:49,559 --> 01:27:50,240
[SPEAKER_13]: It was very solid.

1056
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:52,561
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1057
01:27:52,621 --> 01:27:52,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

1058
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:53,462
[SPEAKER_05]: That it?

1059
01:27:53,522 --> 01:27:53,822
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1060
01:27:53,902 --> 01:27:58,486
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, your classic game of the week for the Nintendo 64, Neon Genesis Evangelion.

1061
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:00,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1062
01:28:01,001 --> 01:28:05,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Neat pick, because I don't know much about that series at all, but watching that YouTube, I was like, oh, this looks kind of fun.

1063
01:28:06,024 --> 01:28:09,647
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, there is plenty more news to come.

1064
01:28:09,767 --> 01:28:13,630
[SPEAKER_05]: The Fugle Question of the Week, all about Zelda, in the spirit of our interview earlier tonight.

1065
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:15,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Your emails, and plenty more.

1066
01:28:15,912 --> 01:28:21,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Your calls, too, when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, episode 504, right after this.

1067
01:28:28,018 --> 01:28:31,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everyone, I'm DJ Ranma S. I'm Ari Rockefeller.

1068
01:28:31,899 --> 01:28:34,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm Mako-chan with Anime Jam Session.

1069
01:28:34,999 --> 01:28:37,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio.

1070
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,240
[SPEAKER_11]: The show where every gamer has a voice.

1071
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:47,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to use my voice to tell you that I like video games because I can kill people and not have to worry about going to prison.

1072
01:28:47,681 --> 01:28:48,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1073
01:28:49,922 --> 01:28:55,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to use my voice to tell you that Final Fantasy VII is the greatest Final Fantasy game of all time.

1074
01:28:55,983 --> 01:28:57,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not overrated.

1075
01:28:58,129 --> 01:28:58,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh boy.

1076
01:28:59,609 --> 01:29:06,712
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to use my voice to tell you that I would pay all my money for a Capcom fighting game crossover where no one pitches about the lineup.

1077
01:29:07,112 --> 01:29:08,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Make a dream, Kenny.

1078
01:29:08,912 --> 01:29:09,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Never happen.

1079
01:29:09,873 --> 01:29:11,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but I do like that.

1080
01:29:12,133 --> 01:29:13,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good idea.

1081
01:29:14,314 --> 01:29:16,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we go get food now?

1082
01:29:17,535 --> 01:29:18,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck yes, I'm hungry.

1083
01:29:18,615 --> 01:29:19,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I kind of want the pink berry.

1084
01:29:20,976 --> 01:29:22,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Mmm, pink berry.

1085
01:29:22,797 --> 01:29:24,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, just got here.

1086
01:29:24,217 --> 01:29:24,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.

1087
01:29:25,398 --> 01:29:25,638
[SPEAKER_02]: See ya.

1088
01:29:28,035 --> 01:29:31,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 504 in progress.

1089
01:29:31,896 --> 01:29:32,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Pete Berry now.

1090
01:29:32,856 --> 01:29:36,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki wants to use his voice to tell you that animes with boobies are better.

1091
01:29:38,777 --> 01:29:39,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I want Pete Berry now.

1092
01:29:40,217 --> 01:29:41,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything with boobies is better.

1093
01:29:42,038 --> 01:29:47,339
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I can actually imagine a few things that putting boobs on would make it absolutely not better.

1094
01:29:48,019 --> 01:29:49,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you imagine boobs with boobs?

1095
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:51,019
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be frightening.

1096
01:29:51,139 --> 01:29:51,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Double boobs?

1097
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:52,660
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no.

1098
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Just boobs that have boobs.

1099
01:29:55,031 --> 01:29:55,451
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1100
01:30:22,749 --> 01:30:26,033
[SPEAKER_05]: and so I was playing Mega Man the Power Battle this week.

1101
01:30:26,393 --> 01:30:27,254
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of awesome.

1102
01:30:27,394 --> 01:30:27,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

1103
01:30:28,615 --> 01:30:29,056
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

1104
01:30:29,196 --> 01:30:29,436
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1105
01:30:31,999 --> 01:30:34,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I will check that out as well too.

1106
01:30:34,882 --> 01:30:38,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to hear it about the whole you shouldn't support meme and piracy and all that.

1107
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:47,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought every single stinking Capcom Arcade bundle pack and every freaking... You supported Game Room.

1108
01:30:47,272 --> 01:30:47,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

1109
01:30:47,472 --> 01:30:47,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did.

1110
01:30:47,913 --> 01:30:48,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Look.

1111
01:30:48,213 --> 01:30:49,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

1112
01:30:49,113 --> 01:30:51,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I eat up all that retro shit when they put it out.

1113
01:30:51,635 --> 01:30:52,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Totally, totally, totally.

1114
01:30:53,156 --> 01:31:00,041
[SPEAKER_13]: The Metal Slug games are actually super fun with the arcade, but Blazing Star... I told you how to get it to work, right?

1115
01:31:00,782 --> 01:31:04,985
[SPEAKER_13]: You start the game, then you leave the game and go back into it, and then the arcade will work with it.

1116
01:31:05,485 --> 01:31:05,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1117
01:31:05,866 --> 01:31:07,006
[SPEAKER_13]: It won't right when you start up.

1118
01:31:07,026 --> 01:31:07,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1119
01:31:08,027 --> 01:31:08,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Beep Mania Beep Mania

1120
01:31:31,004 --> 01:31:34,546
[SPEAKER_13]: You should make your joystick your scratch.

1121
01:31:35,507 --> 01:31:36,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Just flick it with your hand.

1122
01:31:37,528 --> 01:31:38,288
[SPEAKER_06]: It shouldn't be that hard.

1123
01:31:38,328 --> 01:31:41,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1124
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:42,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think so.

1125
01:31:44,972 --> 01:31:48,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well anyway, we're going to get back into some news here.

1126
01:31:48,855 --> 01:31:49,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Rapid Fire News.

1127
01:31:50,136 --> 01:31:50,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki.

1128
01:31:51,414 --> 01:31:51,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1129
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:13,177
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they're trying to fix that.

1130
01:32:14,558 --> 01:32:15,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll have to see later this week.

1131
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:18,019
[SPEAKER_06]: She makes for some interesting reads.

1132
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:21,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they announced The Sims 4.

1133
01:32:22,142 --> 01:32:25,584
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be coming next year on PC.

1134
01:32:26,644 --> 01:32:31,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is going to be offline and single player.

1135
01:32:31,707 --> 01:32:33,788
[SPEAKER_06]: They made sure to mention that.

1136
01:32:36,493 --> 01:32:58,226
[SPEAKER_06]: and last but not least um you may remember you know such wonderful games getting rebooted like well Duke Nukem Forever maybe is not a good example but Rise of the Triad well now Shadow Warrior getting uh redone by uh Flying um what was it uh Flying Wild Hog um

1137
01:32:59,587 --> 01:33:05,752
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the developer, and it's supposed to be published by Devolver Digital, which has done all sorts of awesome things.

1138
01:33:08,842 --> 01:33:34,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost forgot about Shadow Warrior I love Shadow Warrior because it had a slightly better version of the build engine so you could do upstairs and downstairs because remember with the build engine you couldn't really create rooms like if you had an elevator or something like that you had to create a teleporter that would teleport you to a different room it was the limitations of the engine looks cool, I can't wait

1139
01:33:35,321 --> 01:33:42,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to the SimCity stories for a minute here at our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, DungeonBuster says, great, another traffic fix.

1140
01:33:42,253 --> 01:33:44,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Haven't they had to fix the traffic in like every single patch?

1141
01:33:44,478 --> 01:33:45,259
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing something to it?

1142
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:46,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they have.

1143
01:33:46,862 --> 01:33:47,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1144
01:33:50,405 --> 01:33:51,205
[SPEAKER_05]: It just hasn't worked.

1145
01:33:51,266 --> 01:33:53,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, traffic is a serious problem.

1146
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:57,068
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, you know, if you can fix traffic that easy, LA would have it figured out by now, right?

1147
01:33:57,088 --> 01:34:01,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, remember the last time they tried it, the last patch, like, fucked up sewage or something like that.

1148
01:34:02,391 --> 01:34:05,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it'll get taken apart once they put it out.

1149
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:09,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, forgot to mention that SimCity has reached 1.6 million in sales.

1150
01:34:09,995 --> 01:34:15,858
[SPEAKER_06]: 50% of that were online, so that's not surprising, I think.

1151
01:34:16,348 --> 01:34:33,978
[SPEAKER_05]: considering them if you think about considering that you know I don't know a lot of people purchase PC games online nowadays speaking of traffic just totally random aside question I heard this on the radio the other day obviously LA is the worst city in the nation for traffic but do you know what the number two city in the nation is Atlanta Georgia

1152
01:34:35,089 --> 01:34:36,130
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not Atlanta, Georgia.

1153
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:39,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you ever been in Atlanta driving?

1154
01:34:39,531 --> 01:34:43,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you it was not ranked number... It might have been number three, I don't know, but it was not number two.

1155
01:34:43,413 --> 01:34:45,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was not Sacramento and it's not San Francisco.

1156
01:34:45,874 --> 01:34:46,494
[SPEAKER_05]: San Francisco on game day?

1157
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:47,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, it's not San Francisco either.

1158
01:34:48,175 --> 01:34:51,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Honolulu, second worst city for traffic.

1159
01:34:51,877 --> 01:34:59,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is interesting, but I guess when you think it's kind of all by itself out there and if they didn't build it right the first time, there's not a lot of other places to build.

1160
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:00,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense.

1161
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:01,561
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1162
01:35:02,522 --> 01:35:02,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow...

1163
01:35:03,903 --> 01:35:05,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I do have to agree with Prince Brightstar.

1164
01:35:05,646 --> 01:35:06,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Boston is pretty bad.

1165
01:35:06,828 --> 01:35:08,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Boston is very bad.

1166
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:11,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, Atlanta is the worst traffic I have ever been in.

1167
01:35:11,675 --> 01:35:13,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, is Atlanta the worst?

1168
01:35:13,377 --> 01:35:13,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes or no?

1169
01:35:14,519 --> 01:35:15,961
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's really bad.

1170
01:35:16,222 --> 01:35:17,784
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really, really bad.

1171
01:35:18,345 --> 01:35:18,645
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1172
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:24,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me move on to some Nintendo-focused stories here.

1173
01:35:24,967 --> 01:35:27,047
[SPEAKER_05]: First one is about Super Mario RPG.

1174
01:35:27,427 --> 01:35:31,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario RPG is going to be a reward for Club Nintendo members.

1175
01:35:32,148 --> 01:35:38,489
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get that on the Wii Virtual Console for 200 coins if you are a Club Nintendo member.

1176
01:35:39,009 --> 01:35:44,610
[SPEAKER_05]: That's on the Wii Virtual Console, not Wii U. You can also get Maboshi's Arcade for WiiWare for $150.

1177
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:46,971
[SPEAKER_05]: 3D Classics Excitebike for $150.

1178
01:35:47,591 --> 01:35:48,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that free at one point?

1179
01:35:49,391 --> 01:35:52,334
[SPEAKER_05]: ArtStyleAquia for 100 coins.

1180
01:35:52,374 --> 01:35:54,635
[SPEAKER_05]: That's on DSiWare on the 3DS.

1181
01:35:56,497 --> 01:35:59,479
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a cool game that I really wish would have a sequel.

1182
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:01,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Modern RPG?

1183
01:36:01,581 --> 01:36:02,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

1184
01:36:03,822 --> 01:36:08,526
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have 150 extra coins to spare if you purchase Super Metroid using coins.

1185
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:26,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo in a very interesting move decided to refund people who bought Super Metroid using 150 coins because of the 30 cent promotion coming up on Wii U they decided to refund the coins how kind that is actually a very nice thing to do because I would have thought people just should have been smarter and known that that was coming

1186
01:36:27,441 --> 01:36:27,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Metroid E3

1187
01:36:43,844 --> 01:36:45,466
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really no surprise at all.

1188
01:36:45,626 --> 01:36:51,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Reggie Fils-Aimé and Shigeru Miyamoto are going to be hosting the pre-E3 presentation.

1189
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:52,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, duh, right?

1190
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:54,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the big personalities at Nintendo.

1191
01:36:54,813 --> 01:37:00,417
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest shock is that they say presentation, not a million presentations.

1192
01:37:01,658 --> 01:37:04,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but there could still be future ones done by others.

1193
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:06,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not always just the two of them in the videos.

1194
01:37:07,082 --> 01:37:08,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen plenty of other people in there, so...

1195
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:13,509
[SPEAKER_05]: The presentation will be to selected media and it's going to take place before the show floor opens to the public.

1196
01:37:29,246 --> 01:37:33,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Once the presentation is over, members of the press gets to test out the titles before anyone else.

1197
01:37:34,391 --> 01:37:35,892
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they're doing.

1198
01:37:36,252 --> 01:37:37,893
[SPEAKER_06]: They've already announced that's what they were doing.

1199
01:37:37,913 --> 01:37:40,656
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm saying that Reggie Fils-Aimé and Miyamoto are hosting it.

1200
01:37:41,336 --> 01:37:41,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, cool.

1201
01:37:42,377 --> 01:37:43,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is no surprise, I'm sure.

1202
01:37:43,798 --> 01:37:44,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure his body's ready.

1203
01:37:47,281 --> 01:37:48,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I could get in.

1204
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:48,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.

1205
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:49,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my body to be ready.

1206
01:37:50,143 --> 01:37:51,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DarkSakura.

1207
01:37:53,606 --> 01:37:55,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I was complaining about Florida Cops.

1208
01:37:57,602 --> 01:38:00,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, apologies to any of our listeners who is cop in Florida.

1209
01:38:00,465 --> 01:38:01,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you are not all assholes.

1210
01:38:02,808 --> 01:38:03,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1211
01:38:03,729 --> 01:38:13,700
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, coming to the 3DS eShop is a, uh, Summit Hedgehog, which is good news for everybody who is interested in playing that on your, uh,

1212
01:38:15,009 --> 01:38:15,729
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1213
01:38:46,756 --> 01:39:04,487
[SPEAKER_13]: and then last but not least GameStop is not going to be taking PS2 trade-ins anymore even though they will still be selling the games as of June 1st they will not accept the console or related products for trade assholes

1214
01:39:06,742 --> 01:39:08,284
[SPEAKER_13]: They're very excited about the PS4.

1215
01:39:08,504 --> 01:39:09,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be real, though.

1216
01:39:09,705 --> 01:39:12,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not so much that they're assholes.

1217
01:39:12,047 --> 01:39:12,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they are assholes.

1218
01:39:12,727 --> 01:39:13,748
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need the shelf space.

1219
01:39:13,788 --> 01:39:14,969
[SPEAKER_05]: But not because of this, yeah.

1220
01:39:15,129 --> 01:39:15,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1221
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:16,851
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1222
01:39:17,311 --> 01:39:26,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that they're missing out on a market, or they're going to be closing off an area of revenue, but I think they're... I don't know.

1223
01:39:26,078 --> 01:39:26,979
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't think it's very wise.

1224
01:39:27,745 --> 01:39:28,786
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1225
01:39:48,675 --> 01:39:50,818
[SPEAKER_05]: which makes me wonder how old most of those pictures are.

1226
01:39:51,979 --> 01:39:52,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Go figure.

1227
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:53,481
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1228
01:39:53,521 --> 01:39:59,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if that does it for DarkSakura's rapid-fire news, then we're going to go to the foogle question of the week.

1229
01:39:59,247 --> 01:40:00,168
[SPEAKER_12]: I rapid-fired that.

1230
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:03,092
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the right theme song.

1231
01:40:03,112 --> 01:40:03,532
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?

1232
01:40:04,013 --> 01:40:04,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Jeez, Rab.

1233
01:40:11,277 --> 01:40:13,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook.com slash Orange Sounds Radio or Google Plus.

1234
01:40:14,019 --> 01:40:16,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Slam those words together, you get Fugle Plus.

1235
01:40:16,561 --> 01:40:18,162
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's Fugle.

1236
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:25,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight on Fugle, we plugged the interview we had in our first half with Joe, the creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone, the movie.

1237
01:40:26,008 --> 01:40:33,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And we thought, you know, since this was a documentary all about The Legend of Zelda, we're going to ask our listeners this week, what's your favorite memory of The Legend of Zelda series?

1238
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:37,256
[SPEAKER_05]: This could be something that happened in the game or a memory you have about playing it.

1239
01:40:37,296 --> 01:40:38,397
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to leave it wide open.

1240
01:40:38,417 --> 01:40:40,679
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go to some of the answers on Facebook first.

1241
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:44,942
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start with Jeremy from the Koopa Club podcast.

1242
01:40:44,962 --> 01:40:45,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I like them.

1243
01:40:45,403 --> 01:40:45,803
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fun.

1244
01:40:46,744 --> 01:40:53,389
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my biggest and happiest memories from childhood was playing the original NES Legend of Zelda with my older brother and sister.

1245
01:40:53,909 --> 01:41:01,175
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not what I'd call a close family, and we don't really have much in common, but that game brought us all together, as hokey as it sounds.

1246
01:41:01,695 --> 01:41:05,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Exploring the dungeons, bombing every wall, trying to burn every bush.

1247
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:08,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an amazing experience for me as a five-year-old.

1248
01:41:09,801 --> 01:41:15,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember going around trying to set every single bush on fire in the game because you want to see if there's any more secrets.

1249
01:41:16,265 --> 01:41:17,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you do that, DarkSakura?

1250
01:41:17,206 --> 01:41:18,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you set everything on fire?

1251
01:41:18,626 --> 01:41:25,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I did, and I bombed everything, and I tried to grab every single rock possible, and I would bomb every wall.

1252
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:28,392
[SPEAKER_13]: I would run into every wall in a dungeon to see if I could walk through it.

1253
01:41:28,732 --> 01:41:29,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, cool story

1254
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:47,861
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'll see you next time.

1255
01:42:02,734 --> 01:42:03,835
[SPEAKER_05]: and Anticipation.

1256
01:42:04,456 --> 01:42:05,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember this?

1257
01:42:05,197 --> 01:42:05,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1258
01:42:05,597 --> 01:42:08,020
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the little drawing game that was the board game.

1259
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:08,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember it.

1260
01:42:08,861 --> 01:42:13,467
[SPEAKER_05]: And they draw the little pictures and my mom would just sit back in the chair and go, it's a trumpet.

1261
01:42:14,608 --> 01:42:16,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, buzz in, it's a trumpet.

1262
01:42:16,911 --> 01:42:17,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a trumpet, Rob.

1263
01:42:19,557 --> 01:42:20,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1264
01:42:42,243 --> 01:42:44,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to the Facebook question of the week, Google question of the week.

1265
01:42:45,104 --> 01:42:52,366
[SPEAKER_05]: XLink says, The first time playing Legend of Zelda, for the first time it came out, after it came out, and trying to help my friend beat the game.

1266
01:42:53,106 --> 01:42:56,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Playing it for hours on end, going through and trying to find all of the dungeons.

1267
01:42:56,906 --> 01:42:59,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Called the Nintendo Power Hotline just to get help for it.

1268
01:42:59,607 --> 01:43:01,467
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, my mother gave the okay for it.

1269
01:43:01,908 --> 01:43:04,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Thus why I have the name Link for my handle.

1270
01:43:04,568 --> 01:43:06,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Although the XLink is a different story.

1271
01:43:06,389 --> 01:43:08,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I never knew that the Link part of that came from Zelda.

1272
01:43:08,869 --> 01:43:11,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when you had to get permission to call the tip line?

1273
01:43:11,671 --> 01:43:12,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I never got... I never did.

1274
01:43:12,831 --> 01:43:18,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I never... Well... We had some long-distance phone bills at my house.

1275
01:43:18,494 --> 01:43:21,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I never got said permission from my mom.

1276
01:43:21,076 --> 01:43:24,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, it was like, Rob, you are not calling Washington.

1277
01:43:24,758 --> 01:43:26,298
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need to figure it out.

1278
01:43:26,699 --> 01:43:27,979
[SPEAKER_05]: You can figure it out, Rob.

1279
01:43:28,019 --> 01:43:30,461
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be like, Grandma, I'm calling that Nintendo line.

1280
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:31,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you write them a letter?

1281
01:43:31,741 --> 01:43:33,982
[SPEAKER_13]: You only can talk to them for 10 minutes.

1282
01:43:35,763 --> 01:43:39,865
[SPEAKER_13]: That was seriously, I have to, I need to actually talk to my mom so I have my accent.

1283
01:43:40,845 --> 01:43:43,386
[SPEAKER_13]: You only got 10 minutes to talk to those people and then you gotta hang up.

1284
01:43:43,406 --> 01:43:45,067
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care if they're halfway through conversation.

1285
01:43:46,208 --> 01:43:46,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, ma'am.

1286
01:43:46,968 --> 01:43:52,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I did get permission later on to call the official Sierra bulletin board system, which was a long distance call.

1287
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:55,191
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could download like King's Quest demos or something.

1288
01:43:55,211 --> 01:43:56,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

1289
01:43:57,512 --> 01:43:59,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to Fugle.

1290
01:43:59,574 --> 01:44:04,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And Matt J on Facebook says, The Zelda series, along with Metroid, has always held a special place in my heart.

1291
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,503
[SPEAKER_05]: The first Zelda title I ever played was A Link to the Past.

1292
01:44:07,723 --> 01:44:10,726
[SPEAKER_05]: It, along with Super Metroid, cemented my love of gaming.

1293
01:44:11,487 --> 01:44:11,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1294
01:44:12,808 --> 01:44:14,229
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my greatest summers as a child was 1995.

1295
01:44:15,209 --> 01:44:19,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and my two best friends at the time played through several SNES titles, A Link to the Past and Super Metroid.

1296
01:44:20,372 --> 01:44:23,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember many a summer day playing through A Link to the Past with them.

1297
01:44:23,954 --> 01:44:27,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was a single player title, but it felt like we were playing it together.

1298
01:44:27,296 --> 01:44:31,498
[SPEAKER_05]: We would all huddle around my friend's small black and white TV volume blaring as we went through the game.

1299
01:44:31,778 --> 01:44:32,138
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1300
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:57,821
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really good story.

1301
01:44:58,281 --> 01:45:02,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a little, like for real, I got a little, little verklempt hearing that story.

1302
01:45:02,343 --> 01:45:03,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you talking amongst yourself?

1303
01:45:04,144 --> 01:45:04,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I might be.

1304
01:45:06,185 --> 01:45:14,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, there's actually a bunch of chat going on right now about, you know, everyone's big retro games, you know, playing with their parents.

1305
01:45:14,909 --> 01:45:19,412
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was actually just recalling the cutthroat games my mother and I would have with Dr. Mario.

1306
01:45:20,752 --> 01:45:22,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Cutthroat games.

1307
01:45:22,293 --> 01:45:24,074
[SPEAKER_13]: She would get mad.

1308
01:45:25,894 --> 01:45:26,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're cheating.

1309
01:45:27,435 --> 01:45:30,836
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool that you could play those games because my mom would only play the game show stuff.

1310
01:45:30,856 --> 01:45:35,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And on Commodore 64, she would play Jeopardy and Family Feud with me.

1311
01:45:35,858 --> 01:45:36,638
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's really it.

1312
01:45:37,179 --> 01:45:44,301
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, that was really... It's kind of sad the way... Sadly, I've long since lost touch with my two friends, but the memories will never die.

1313
01:45:44,621 --> 01:45:48,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I just want to, like, play that song that'll take you back to that summer.

1314
01:45:48,703 --> 01:45:49,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it just...

1315
01:45:56,325 --> 01:45:59,247
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm leaving.

1316
01:45:59,327 --> 01:46:01,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to walk through the football field and pump my fist.

1317
01:46:02,009 --> 01:46:03,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just began it.

1318
01:46:06,813 --> 01:46:07,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1319
01:46:08,065 --> 01:46:36,820
[SPEAKER_05]: back to more Facebook answers on James S on the Fugo question of the week says being six years old and finally completing a link to the past from start to finish without a guide mind you was one of my favorite childhood memories it took it took my grandmother and my cousins about a year to finish it to this day I still play through it once every few years just to try and recapture that same magic from all those years ago there's only one other game that holds the same magic and memories for me and that's Illusion of Gaia they just don't make them like they used to hey guys ain't that the truth

1320
01:46:41,425 --> 01:46:45,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you play through any adventure games or was it just the competitive stuff that you played with your mom?

1321
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:53,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, my mom really liked playing Super Mario Brothers a lot to the point where I would be chased out of my own room.

1322
01:46:55,217 --> 01:47:02,763
[SPEAKER_13]: But she wasn't really into like Zelda or anything like that and when I borrowed my friend's, by borrow I mean, I borrowed it and he moved.

1323
01:47:03,764 --> 01:47:04,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Copy?

1324
01:47:04,404 --> 01:47:04,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not yours.

1325
01:47:05,625 --> 01:47:07,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well that's also how I acquired my Chrono Trigger.

1326
01:47:07,987 --> 01:47:08,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1327
01:47:28,876 --> 01:47:29,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Win, lose, or draw.

1328
01:47:50,762 --> 01:47:54,683
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making Draw Something into a game show, which is the same thing.

1329
01:47:54,823 --> 01:47:59,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but Draw Something is actually pretty... But it doesn't have Burt Reynolds and Burt Conroy?

1330
01:47:59,404 --> 01:48:00,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Convoy?

1331
01:48:00,784 --> 01:48:01,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Conroy.

1332
01:48:01,205 --> 01:48:04,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just like how they made Words with Friends into a board game.

1333
01:48:05,906 --> 01:48:07,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Bejeweled into a board game.

1334
01:48:07,606 --> 01:48:09,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck, I just will play Scrabble.

1335
01:48:10,087 --> 01:48:11,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was also a great game show.

1336
01:48:12,586 --> 01:48:14,247
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what actually was also a good game show?

1337
01:48:14,648 --> 01:48:15,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Bumpers Stumpers.

1338
01:48:15,649 --> 01:48:17,210
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a great game show on USA.

1339
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:17,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Chuck Woolery.

1340
01:48:17,931 --> 01:48:18,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I sure do.

1341
01:48:18,471 --> 01:48:19,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Chuck Woolery is the man.

1342
01:48:20,033 --> 01:48:22,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on USA just before up all night.

1343
01:48:22,355 --> 01:48:22,616
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1344
01:48:22,856 --> 01:48:27,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Haseo Surumogawa says, beating the water temple without help when I was 10.

1345
01:48:28,905 --> 01:48:32,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Wicked says, not a specific memory in-game, but an entire game itself.

1346
01:48:32,609 --> 01:48:34,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past.

1347
01:48:34,571 --> 01:48:42,358
[SPEAKER_05]: It took every single thing that made the first Legend of Zelda good, multiplied it by ten, then took everything I felt was bad in it and nullified it.

1348
01:48:42,799 --> 01:48:44,881
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no bad in the original Legend of Zelda.

1349
01:48:44,901 --> 01:48:45,461
[SPEAKER_05]: What's wrong with you?

1350
01:48:45,501 --> 01:48:45,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

1351
01:48:45,982 --> 01:48:46,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Zelda 2, maybe.

1352
01:48:46,702 --> 01:48:47,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1353
01:48:48,104 --> 01:48:49,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people love Zelda 2, but...

1354
01:48:51,112 --> 01:48:55,274
[SPEAKER_05]: The graphics were colorful, the music was orchestral, the control was tight, the design was brilliant.

1355
01:48:55,694 --> 01:49:03,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, I haven't played a Zelda game past Link's Awakening, but I have to say what I have played, A Link to the Past, is the greatest Zelda game ever made.

1356
01:49:03,837 --> 01:49:09,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Ragenator says, My favorite memory is beating the first quest of the original Zelda game on the NES as a kid for the first time.

1357
01:49:10,999 --> 01:49:40,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Andy R lastly on Facebook says when I was younger I really wanted Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons while I was visiting my grandmother my parents told me they'd buy me a game so off we went to the game store the whole way there I explained to my grandmother how there were two games and how they were related and such straight out of Nintendo Power I'm sure when we got there my parents told me they'd only buy me one of them I picked one and we went home that night I was playing it and my grandmother came over with a grin handed me the other game and told me to keep it a secret from my parents

1358
01:49:42,901 --> 01:49:43,761
[SPEAKER_13]: I was so good.

1359
01:49:43,781 --> 01:49:45,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like choking here.

1360
01:49:45,062 --> 01:49:46,423
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great Mother's Day story.

1361
01:49:46,783 --> 01:49:48,665
[SPEAKER_13]: My grandma bought me a Killer Instinct.

1362
01:49:51,607 --> 01:49:52,928
[SPEAKER_05]: That explains a lot.

1363
01:49:53,788 --> 01:50:00,713
[SPEAKER_13]: She took me to four different stores to buy Killer Instinct until we found it at Rest in Peace Montgomery Wards.

1364
01:50:01,434 --> 01:50:15,505
[SPEAKER_05]: to be fair I had to no it wasn't my mom it was my dad my dad was the only one that would go to like software etc and all that with me so when like Mortal Kombat came out and all that and I pitched a fit until they gave me my CD you pitching a fit even younger girl

1365
01:50:17,185 --> 01:50:19,587
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go to Google+.

1366
01:50:19,627 --> 01:50:22,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple answers over there, but the first one from Redertainment.

1367
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:25,432
[SPEAKER_05]: When we were kids, my sister and I both had our own Game Boys.

1368
01:50:25,773 --> 01:50:27,875
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the original large black and white Game Boy.

1369
01:50:27,935 --> 01:50:30,697
[SPEAKER_05]: My sister broke her Game Boy by hitting it while she was playing it.

1370
01:50:31,017 --> 01:50:34,360
[SPEAKER_05]: My sister begged and pleaded with me to allow her to play with my Game Boy.

1371
01:50:34,721 --> 01:50:39,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I said no because she broke hers, and I was sure she would break mine in the same way my sister broke hers.

1372
01:50:40,926 --> 01:50:48,851
[SPEAKER_05]: After her typical high amount of whining and crying to my parents, my parents told me to let my sister play my Game Boy despite me being absolutely sure that she would break it.

1373
01:50:49,312 --> 01:50:53,234
[SPEAKER_05]: My sister did end up breaking my Game Boy by hitting it as she was playing it.

1374
01:50:53,674 --> 01:50:56,136
[SPEAKER_05]: She was playing Zelda Link's Awakening at the time.

1375
01:50:56,516 --> 01:51:01,759
[SPEAKER_05]: This might not sound like a good memory, but it is because I was proven to be right and I like being right.

1376
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:05,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I especially like being right when my sister and my parents are wrong.

1377
01:51:09,191 --> 01:51:09,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.

1378
01:51:10,552 --> 01:51:20,179
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, Flaco Jones saying, the ending to Link's Awakening was the best video game ending I have ever experienced to that point and still ranks up there with my favorite endings ever.

1379
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:25,023
[SPEAKER_05]: The Ballad of the Wind Fish just adds to it by being the most memorable Zelda game moment for me.

1380
01:51:26,224 --> 01:51:54,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I read every answer tonight I shortened some of them a little bit for time but every answer if you want to see the complete answers facebook.com slash orange launch radio or google plus orange launch radio it's not too late to add your response either because the people that posted before will see it so great job tonight you guys I loved some of those stories the big memory ones about grandma and about the two friends you don't talk to anymore that got me in a special place it did alright you alright

1381
01:51:55,647 --> 01:51:56,767
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thinking about my grandma.

1382
01:51:56,927 --> 01:51:57,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1383
01:51:57,988 --> 01:51:59,028
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what else she was responsible for?

1384
01:51:59,068 --> 01:52:00,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this the same one who got you Killer Instinct?

1385
01:52:00,929 --> 01:52:01,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1386
01:52:01,329 --> 01:52:01,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1387
01:52:01,989 --> 01:52:04,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'll go ahead and just give the quick, quick story.

1388
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:20,215
[SPEAKER_13]: She's got a dead hip socket, had three strokes, and cerebral vasculitis, meaning that she has swelling in her arteries and veins and everything in her brain, and two aneurysms.

1389
01:52:21,375 --> 01:52:48,032
[SPEAKER_13]: But this is, she, I talked to her the other day, she was just fine And I remember that she also, and I don't think she actually realized what she was getting me at the time But she also got me my Kirby's Avalanche Which, you know my love for all things Pio Pio She got me my entire collection of Red Hot Chili Peppers cassettes at the time Because I was super, super obsessed with Red Hot Chili Peppers Really?

1390
01:52:48,052 --> 01:52:48,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah

1391
01:52:48,872 --> 01:52:55,359
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, you know, she put up with me, you know, blasting Radiohead at all hours of the night.

1392
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:56,901
[SPEAKER_13]: My grandmom is the best.

1393
01:52:57,642 --> 01:53:02,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And she, she would always say that she was trying not to spoil me, but she did spoil me pretty bad.

1394
01:53:02,908 --> 01:53:05,311
[SPEAKER_13]: And she took care of me when my mom moved to Arizona, so...

1395
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:07,041
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1396
01:53:22,219 --> 01:53:42,551
[SPEAKER_06]: and unfortunately not a lot of games from EA on the Wii U and it doesn't sound like that's going to be changing anytime soon because the brand new Frostbite 3 engine that they're going to be using for Battlefield 4 and I think I want to say a lot of the upcoming sports games, like they're going to be going with the Frostbite 3 engine.

1397
01:53:42,591 --> 01:53:44,252
[SPEAKER_13]: And whatever the next Mass Effect is.

1398
01:53:45,093 --> 01:53:51,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, they will not run on the Wii U. So...

1399
01:53:53,047 --> 01:53:53,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

1400
01:53:53,727 --> 01:53:54,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's not good.

1401
01:53:54,927 --> 01:54:02,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, I mean, you could say that they may be able to port it to Wii U if they created another engine that could ride it.

1402
01:54:02,729 --> 01:54:09,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe like an upgraded Frostbite 2 engine, kind of like how they do with some of the Unreal 3 stuff or whatever.

1403
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:12,410
[SPEAKER_06]: But is it really worth it to them?

1404
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:21,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're just kind of saying, do we really want to put this much effort into creating a new engine to only sell like maybe 100,000 copies, if that?

1405
01:54:22,352 --> 01:54:27,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then, and I bet Mass Effect 3 didn't exactly sell very well, but it's because there wasn't 1 and 2.

1406
01:54:27,915 --> 01:54:33,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that and the whole preview, whatever the Genesis 2 was, was shit.

1407
01:54:34,098 --> 01:54:34,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Utter shit.

1408
01:54:34,878 --> 01:54:39,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if they just didn't have the gamepad functioning in 1 and 2, just poured them over.

1409
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:39,601
[SPEAKER_05]: God.

1410
01:54:40,641 --> 01:54:45,463
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess, you know, it's easier for me to sit here and say, just cram it from that box into that box.

1411
01:54:45,604 --> 01:54:45,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Just cram it.

1412
01:54:46,744 --> 01:55:15,757
[SPEAKER_06]: amp up the graphics in level 3 I'm sure they could have done that but I'm willing to bet a lot of the reasons why they don't have all games being ported over there is Nintendo probably requires a certain amount of connectivity with the gamepad and if they're saying okay listen you have to use the gamepad in some function that's probably why you see a lot of these games not getting Wii U ports YYR in chat needs some clarification are they developing the same engine for 360 and PS3 or is this for the next wait so a 360 it won't run on the Wii U

1413
01:55:16,862 --> 01:55:18,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Converted Smartphone Games

1414
01:55:41,343 --> 01:55:42,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has offered professional use conversion software.

1415
01:56:01,449 --> 01:56:07,410
[SPEAKER_05]: to certain app devs in the hopes that smartphone software could help boost the Wii U's sales figures.

1416
01:56:08,031 --> 01:56:27,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming that's just to kind of boost up some of the eShop content, which we've heard is very indie-friendly to begin with, but I'm not sure that alone is going to save the Wii U. I mean, granted, a robust downloadable title stuff will help tremendously, but it's not going to be one on those mobile games alone.

1417
01:56:28,275 --> 01:56:30,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people who want to play mobile phone games will get...

1418
01:56:31,456 --> 01:56:32,137
[SPEAKER_05]: A mobile phone.

1419
01:56:33,057 --> 01:56:34,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Or already have one.

1420
01:56:34,778 --> 01:56:35,659
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1421
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:37,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Or they'll get an OUYA.

1422
01:56:39,081 --> 01:56:39,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

1423
01:56:39,982 --> 01:56:40,422
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1424
01:56:41,383 --> 01:56:42,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we do have some news.

1425
01:56:43,784 --> 01:56:48,067
[SPEAKER_13]: This is something that I thought was really cool and I'm going to be checking it out.

1426
01:56:48,107 --> 01:56:49,928
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't quite yet, but I've been reading up on it.

1427
01:56:50,529 --> 01:56:59,795
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a game called GeoGuessr that basically uses Google Maps and it drops you in a location.

1428
01:57:00,855 --> 01:57:05,781
[SPEAKER_13]: And you have only a few, you can go a few blocks, you can walk around.

1429
01:57:05,881 --> 01:57:10,646
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sort of like you were, you know, kidnapped and got away and you have no fucking clue where you are.

1430
01:57:11,446 --> 01:57:18,193
[SPEAKER_13]: So you use your clues around and you have a map and you can pick on the map where you are.

1431
01:57:19,074 --> 01:57:20,975
[SPEAKER_13]: And the closer you get, the more points you get.

1432
01:57:21,455 --> 01:57:22,696
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have five rounds.

1433
01:57:22,836 --> 01:57:26,337
[SPEAKER_13]: And so by the end of it, you can share your scores with your friends.

1434
01:57:26,477 --> 01:57:27,418
[SPEAKER_13]: You can be competitive.

1435
01:57:28,878 --> 01:57:37,342
[SPEAKER_13]: And they actually are saying on the GeoGuessr Twitter that is working on other type of competitive play options

1436
01:57:38,242 --> 01:58:05,298
[SPEAKER_13]: and uh like there's this one scene on here where it's just showing you know a plain road with a dirt around it and you have to figure out where you are so it's really sadly what most of it looks most of google maps looks like if you really think like that one that you're on right there that picture yeah to me that i would put that in uh on the stretch of uh between nevada and uh let me let me look at this really big here does it say where it's at

1437
01:58:05,865 --> 01:58:06,585
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't think so.

1438
01:58:27,492 --> 01:58:29,617
[SPEAKER_05]: That could just easily be I-5, honestly.

1439
01:58:29,637 --> 01:58:30,679
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be I-5.

1440
01:58:30,699 --> 01:58:31,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1441
01:58:31,541 --> 01:58:35,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Too bad you don't have smell-o-vision, because if you smell cow death, you know you're on the I-5.

1442
01:58:36,251 --> 01:58:37,655
[SPEAKER_13]: And you drive right past cowschwitz.

1443
01:58:38,911 --> 01:58:40,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I like games out of Google Maps though.

1444
01:58:41,173 --> 01:58:43,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Things like that, I like those little exploration games.

1445
01:58:43,275 --> 01:58:44,796
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much cool shit on Google Maps.

1446
01:58:44,956 --> 01:58:52,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And to the Wii U's credit, that's one of the cool things I've enjoyed on the Wii U is that Google exploration thing where you can actually panorama around.

1447
01:58:52,142 --> 01:58:53,623
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know what I would love to see?

1448
01:58:54,323 --> 01:58:57,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Is a Google Maps integrated Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

1449
01:58:57,306 --> 01:58:58,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that's awesome.

1450
01:58:58,547 --> 01:58:59,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Couldn't you see that?

1451
01:58:59,748 --> 01:59:02,970
[SPEAKER_13]: And you have to do the shop view to see if she's inside a place.

1452
01:59:03,030 --> 01:59:03,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's rad.

1453
01:59:04,331 --> 01:59:06,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, don't steal my ideas.

1454
01:59:06,033 --> 01:59:06,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Patent pending.

1455
01:59:06,533 --> 01:59:07,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Patent pending.

1456
01:59:07,174 --> 01:59:07,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Patent pending.

1457
01:59:08,495 --> 01:59:09,356
[SPEAKER_13]: You heard it here first.

1458
01:59:09,436 --> 01:59:11,678
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to be starting a Kickstarter tomorrow.

1459
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:13,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Except, wait a minute.

1460
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:14,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Hiring programmers.

1461
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:19,625
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't own Carmen Sandiego, so... I'll be like... I'm going to be the star.

1462
01:59:19,645 --> 01:59:21,067
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be where the fuck is Jamie now.

1463
01:59:22,428 --> 01:59:22,968
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1464
01:59:23,269 --> 01:59:23,769
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1465
01:59:24,570 --> 01:59:26,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So... When in doubt, change the star to yourself.

1466
01:59:27,032 --> 01:59:27,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1467
01:59:27,492 --> 01:59:28,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Great logic.

1468
01:59:28,673 --> 01:59:29,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it'll be like...

1469
01:59:30,826 --> 01:59:32,528
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't had an OLR dream game in a while.

1470
01:59:32,828 --> 01:59:35,951
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's our new dream game, Where the Fuck is Jamie?

1471
01:59:36,031 --> 01:59:37,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the Fuck is Jamie Now?

1472
01:59:41,435 --> 01:59:42,216
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think, Loki?

1473
01:59:42,296 --> 01:59:45,058
[SPEAKER_13]: If you were going to make this game realistic, it'd be in her pajamas at home.

1474
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:47,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I found her again.

1475
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:49,222
[SPEAKER_06]: She's in the same spot.

1476
01:59:49,742 --> 01:59:51,884
[SPEAKER_06]: She's at 7-Eleven buying Guinness again.

1477
01:59:51,924 --> 01:59:52,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Click, click.

1478
01:59:53,425 --> 01:59:54,106
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no, no.

1479
01:59:54,666 --> 01:59:55,547
[SPEAKER_13]: I live in Citrus Heights.

1480
01:59:55,587 --> 01:59:56,288
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the Tower Mart.

1481
01:59:57,549 --> 01:59:57,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

1482
01:59:58,069 --> 01:59:58,990
[SPEAKER_05]: She's at Disneyland.

1483
02:00:01,528 --> 02:00:04,357
[SPEAKER_05]: She dragged Dan to a Starbucks saying, Coffee!

1484
02:00:04,898 --> 02:00:07,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Prince, Brightstar in chat says needs a co-star Waldo type character.

1485
02:00:07,899 --> 02:00:09,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that would be me.

1486
02:00:32,042 --> 02:00:32,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my God.

1487
02:00:54,702 --> 02:00:55,243
[SPEAKER_13]: I need to go.

1488
02:00:55,523 --> 02:00:56,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so good.

1489
02:00:56,845 --> 02:00:57,346
[SPEAKER_05]: So good.

1490
02:00:57,767 --> 02:00:58,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I just haven't been given a fuck.

1491
02:00:58,988 --> 02:01:01,432
[SPEAKER_13]: We have itsits at my house in M&M's, which I brought some here.

1492
02:01:02,033 --> 02:01:02,493
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyway.

1493
02:01:04,917 --> 02:01:07,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you have something besides where the fuck is Jamie now?

1494
02:01:08,669 --> 02:01:12,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, let's talk about Google Play.

1495
02:01:13,092 --> 02:01:15,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Going back to mobile phone games again.

1496
02:01:16,754 --> 02:01:23,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Google Play Games is apparently something that leaked out thanks to the Android Police.

1497
02:01:23,659 --> 02:01:24,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's actually a website.

1498
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:51,350
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's from I guess a Play Services APK Teardown and what is Google Play Games well it's basically their version of Game Center it's got all sorts of wonderful features including you know in-game chat they're saying that cloud saves achievements leaderboards invites matchmaking lobbies all sorts of fun stuff and that will be coming I guess soon

1499
02:01:53,138 --> 02:01:56,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they're saying that it could be revealed this week.

1500
02:01:56,459 --> 02:01:57,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Google's I.O.

1501
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:58,800
[SPEAKER_06]: event is this week.

1502
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:02,902
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be interesting.

1503
02:02:02,922 --> 02:02:08,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be kind of interested to see if they're going to translate this into almost like a console.

1504
02:02:10,144 --> 02:02:12,445
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be interesting.

1505
02:02:12,585 --> 02:02:13,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Just what we need.

1506
02:02:13,685 --> 02:02:14,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Another console.

1507
02:02:15,026 --> 02:02:16,186
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already got the big three.

1508
02:02:16,226 --> 02:02:17,066
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the Ouya.

1509
02:02:17,147 --> 02:02:19,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we just had a report on this mobile phone console.

1510
02:02:19,967 --> 02:02:21,148
[SPEAKER_05]: There's too many consoles.

1511
02:02:22,941 --> 02:02:24,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not want Google to make a console.

1512
02:02:24,602 --> 02:02:26,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Google to team up with somebody else.

1513
02:02:27,204 --> 02:02:28,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, who knows?

1514
02:02:28,825 --> 02:02:30,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Could Microsoft team up with Google?

1515
02:02:30,165 --> 02:02:31,646
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're not really friends, right?

1516
02:02:32,587 --> 02:02:34,168
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, to take out Apple, they might.

1517
02:02:34,268 --> 02:02:34,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

1518
02:02:35,188 --> 02:02:35,509
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1519
02:02:35,549 --> 02:02:42,393
[SPEAKER_13]: There's that Apple-Google rivalry, I think, that they would form an axis to take down the mighty fruit.

1520
02:02:42,713 --> 02:02:44,634
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Apple hasn't announced anything in a while either.

1521
02:02:44,654 --> 02:02:45,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a very long time.

1522
02:02:45,855 --> 02:02:46,455
[SPEAKER_05]: No new iPads.

1523
02:02:46,475 --> 02:02:47,176
[SPEAKER_12]: They're taking a nap.

1524
02:02:47,336 --> 02:02:47,956
[SPEAKER_12]: They're taking a nap.

1525
02:02:48,076 --> 02:02:48,557
[SPEAKER_05]: A little nap?

1526
02:02:48,877 --> 02:02:49,417
[SPEAKER_05]: A little napple?

1527
02:02:50,037 --> 02:02:50,358
[SPEAKER_12]: A napple.

1528
02:02:52,648 --> 02:02:52,928
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1529
02:02:53,248 --> 02:02:57,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we know that... And PrinceBrightStar in chat says, no love for PC.

1530
02:02:57,990 --> 02:03:00,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a PC... I don't know if that's in reference to what I said.

1531
02:03:00,751 --> 02:03:02,351
[SPEAKER_05]: A PC, I don't really count as a console.

1532
02:03:02,711 --> 02:03:05,392
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously, yes, all these games go on PC, too.

1533
02:03:05,472 --> 02:03:09,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's some things you can only get on PC, like World of Warcraft.

1534
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:12,300
[SPEAKER_05]: PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7, PS8

1535
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:50,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Shuhei Yoshida, who is the president of Sony Worldwide Studios, noted in an interview with 4Gamer, which is a Japanese site, that the share button is limited to what developers will allow, which makes a lot of sense.

1536
02:03:50,074 --> 02:03:52,897
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't necessarily want people to be able to share everything.

1537
02:03:53,917 --> 02:04:15,503
[SPEAKER_05]: for example you can like on the Vita you can have certain scenes disable this so you could take a screenshot and the share function might share the screenshot but you might not be able to actually take a video of the entire final boss so you wouldn't be able to like share the ending of the game two hours after the game launches you know something like that so it makes sense

1538
02:04:16,363 --> 02:04:41,936
[SPEAKER_05]: but what else I thought was interesting about the interview is that the video sharing function was inspired by the fact that Shuhei Yoshida wanted to play Dark Souls all day long so he would watch videos of other people playing the game since he was too busy and so that's where the share button came from so that Dark Souls 3 or whatever ends up on the PlayStation 4 he'll be able to use the share button to watch other people play

1539
02:04:43,737 --> 02:04:45,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's a lawyer.

1540
02:04:45,418 --> 02:04:46,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he likes to watch.

1541
02:04:47,159 --> 02:04:47,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

1542
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:50,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he might like to watch, but we like to read.

1543
02:04:51,542 --> 02:04:53,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And every week you guys email us.

1544
02:04:53,763 --> 02:05:01,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura ever so happily opens up the mailbag, dives in and finds a few emails to read for you.

1545
02:05:02,748 --> 02:05:03,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now.

1546
02:05:03,349 --> 02:05:03,749
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1547
02:05:03,949 --> 02:05:04,329
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1548
02:05:04,450 --> 02:05:08,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Every time I look at the mailbag, Eddie Izzard's voice goes into my head going, It's all sticky!

1549
02:05:09,893 --> 02:05:10,013
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

1550
02:05:11,485 --> 02:05:12,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, everyone at OLR.

1551
02:05:12,806 --> 02:05:14,667
[SPEAKER_13]: This is your friendly neighborhood Ragenator.

1552
02:05:15,368 --> 02:05:19,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, I do not have any gaming-related topics this week, but I do... Then bye.

1553
02:05:19,631 --> 02:05:19,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1554
02:05:19,931 --> 02:05:20,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

1555
02:05:21,893 --> 02:05:24,375
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do have some good news to geek out over.

1556
02:05:24,495 --> 02:05:27,517
[SPEAKER_13]: You could... He's doing all this emphasis.

1557
02:05:28,177 --> 02:05:30,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you could just italics... Well, this thing doesn't read italics, does it?

1558
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:33,801
[SPEAKER_13]: You could say I have some perfect news.

1559
02:05:34,342 --> 02:05:35,643
[SPEAKER_13]: As of 3.30 p.m.

1560
02:05:35,783 --> 02:05:39,586
[SPEAKER_13]: EDT, on Friday, 5, 10, 13, I am the proud-as-hell cat owner...

1561
02:05:40,206 --> 02:05:42,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Proud as all Hellcat owner, I saw your kitty and your kitty is cute.

1562
02:05:43,009 --> 02:05:44,630
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I was very busy when you messaged me.

1563
02:05:45,411 --> 02:05:53,878
[SPEAKER_13]: I went to my local SPCA and adopted the most adorable two-year-old male cat that the SPCA named Anakin, who is mostly white with some black patches.

1564
02:05:54,258 --> 02:05:56,360
[SPEAKER_13]: I swear, this cat's back looks like a Rorschach test.

1565
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:57,281
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.

1566
02:05:57,461 --> 02:05:58,421
[SPEAKER_13]: You should name him Rorschach.

1567
02:05:58,942 --> 02:06:03,846
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, he might... You know... But when you beg him for mercy, he might say no.

1568
02:06:04,146 --> 02:06:04,527
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1569
02:06:05,247 --> 02:06:05,688
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll say meow.

1570
02:06:05,768 --> 02:06:06,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Meow.

1571
02:06:06,368 --> 02:06:06,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Meow.

1572
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:11,601
[SPEAKER_13]: He's extremely friendly and playful.

1573
02:06:11,721 --> 02:06:16,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Granted, due to the new environment, he's been hiding under my bed for a while, but I'm sure he'll warm up to my place.

1574
02:06:16,885 --> 02:06:17,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Smile, heart.

1575
02:06:18,145 --> 02:06:27,371
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't had the opportunity to take his picture yet and upload it yet, but I'm working on it and I hope he'll be comfortable enough around my place by Sunday evening when your show airs and you three take calls.

1576
02:06:28,432 --> 02:06:31,054
[SPEAKER_13]: That way the three of you get to see him.

1577
02:06:31,534 --> 02:06:33,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I do like to propose a poll for your show.

1578
02:06:33,615 --> 02:06:38,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Do I keep Anakin as a cat's name or do I name him after Booger, the character from Revenge of the Nerds movies?

1579
02:06:38,937 --> 02:06:40,078
[SPEAKER_13]: I still think you should name him Rorschach.

1580
02:06:40,558 --> 02:06:44,079
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not polling it because Anakin is a clear better name than Booger.

1581
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:45,440
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1582
02:06:45,460 --> 02:06:46,840
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a friend that had a cat named Booger.

1583
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:50,302
[SPEAKER_13]: I told you about Dan's grandfather named his cats Hiss and Spit.

1584
02:06:51,782 --> 02:06:53,743
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I had a friend in high school that had a cat named Bitch.

1585
02:06:56,264 --> 02:06:58,025
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's someone now who has a cat named Asshole.

1586
02:06:58,919 --> 02:07:00,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But bitch is a dog.

1587
02:07:01,541 --> 02:07:02,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Irony, Rob.

1588
02:07:02,441 --> 02:07:02,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Irony.

1589
02:07:02,922 --> 02:07:04,363
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very hipster, okay?

1590
02:07:05,603 --> 02:07:06,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, Rob, I'll let you finish.

1591
02:07:08,806 --> 02:07:12,188
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have to say that I have the greatest kitty ever.

1592
02:07:12,608 --> 02:07:14,709
[SPEAKER_13]: This email was brought to you by Fuzzy Wuzzy Kitties.

1593
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:15,550
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't.

1594
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:16,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Come here, Sanrio.

1595
02:07:16,851 --> 02:07:18,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Sanrio is under your bed.

1596
02:07:19,284 --> 02:07:20,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Sanrio hates people.

1597
02:07:20,725 --> 02:07:22,926
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Midna so fucking much.

1598
02:07:23,206 --> 02:07:24,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Midna is super fucking adorable.

1599
02:07:26,008 --> 02:07:29,310
[SPEAKER_05]: You should just rename your Tumblr Fuck Yeah Midna because that's all it is.

1600
02:07:30,611 --> 02:07:31,631
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not all it is.

1601
02:07:32,072 --> 02:07:34,133
[SPEAKER_05]: You already have like seven Tumblr accounts.

1602
02:07:34,193 --> 02:07:34,833
[SPEAKER_05]: What's one more?

1603
02:07:34,893 --> 02:07:36,034
[SPEAKER_05]: You need a Fuck Yeah Midna.

1604
02:07:36,174 --> 02:07:38,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually made one for one of the fanfics I'm writing.

1605
02:07:38,675 --> 02:07:38,936
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

1606
02:07:39,436 --> 02:07:41,197
[SPEAKER_05]: How many Tumblrs do you have?

1607
02:07:41,621 --> 02:07:42,642
[SPEAKER_13]: I have... Fuck, hold on.

1608
02:07:42,662 --> 02:07:43,423
[SPEAKER_13]: I have my main.

1609
02:07:43,443 --> 02:07:44,383
[SPEAKER_13]: I have that one.

1610
02:07:44,824 --> 02:07:48,387
[SPEAKER_13]: I have Sleepwaking, which is my art... I have an art history Tumblr.

1611
02:07:48,847 --> 02:07:51,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I barely have enough shit to post to one Tumblr.

1612
02:07:51,109 --> 02:07:51,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I have political.

1613
02:07:51,509 --> 02:07:52,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I have mass affecting.

1614
02:07:52,490 --> 02:07:53,110
[SPEAKER_13]: I have mass affecting.

1615
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:54,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one Tumblr.

1616
02:07:54,592 --> 02:07:55,292
[SPEAKER_05]: HelloRobbie.

1617
02:07:55,472 --> 02:07:57,013
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to follow me on Tumblr, HelloRobbie.

1618
02:07:57,594 --> 02:07:58,355
[SPEAKER_05]: R-O-B-B-I-E.

1619
02:07:58,475 --> 02:07:58,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Doodle.

1620
02:07:58,855 --> 02:07:59,716
[SPEAKER_13]: I have seven Tumblrs.

1621
02:08:00,877 --> 02:08:01,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really?

1622
02:08:01,696 --> 02:08:02,136
[SPEAKER_13]: I really do.

1623
02:08:03,497 --> 02:08:05,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't lying.

1624
02:08:05,379 --> 02:08:07,220
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an intervention.

1625
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:08,161
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1626
02:08:08,181 --> 02:08:10,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Bite me.

1627
02:08:11,483 --> 02:08:18,528
[SPEAKER_13]: I did my art history blog just because I know not everyone gives a shit about DeSteel and the Bauhaus movement.

1628
02:08:19,348 --> 02:08:26,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So I made that one and then Mass Effect started taking over my main one so I made my Mass Effect blog and whatever.

1629
02:08:27,054 --> 02:08:27,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't judge me.

1630
02:08:28,935 --> 02:08:32,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft suggests name him Anagar, Anagan plus Booger.

1631
02:08:33,239 --> 02:08:35,221
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think... Name him Rorschach.

1632
02:08:35,601 --> 02:08:39,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Alan obviously named the cats because they were already 10 years old by the time I got in the picture.

1633
02:08:40,365 --> 02:08:44,849
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believed when Alan named Maruko, I think that was two things combined like that.

1634
02:08:45,369 --> 02:08:46,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I think from what he told me.

1635
02:08:46,671 --> 02:08:55,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and actually Queen Simia in chat says Holstein because he's colored like a cat.

1636
02:08:56,607 --> 02:08:58,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, next email.

1637
02:08:59,188 --> 02:09:00,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Too many cats, not enough games.

1638
02:09:00,848 --> 02:09:04,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, then again, there's no such thing as too many cats.

1639
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:05,150
[SPEAKER_13]: You know the rule.

1640
02:09:05,930 --> 02:09:07,511
[SPEAKER_13]: The internet is made for cats.

1641
02:09:08,291 --> 02:09:08,871
[SPEAKER_05]: And porn.

1642
02:09:09,291 --> 02:09:09,992
[SPEAKER_13]: But mostly cats.

1643
02:09:10,952 --> 02:09:11,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And porn.

1644
02:09:11,912 --> 02:09:12,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Cats.

1645
02:09:13,853 --> 02:09:14,613
[SPEAKER_13]: I see what you did there.

1646
02:09:15,193 --> 02:09:15,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Cat porn?

1647
02:09:19,397 --> 02:09:20,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I like pussy.

1648
02:09:21,378 --> 02:09:23,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't get me started on the furry community.

1649
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:28,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually really like fursuiters.

1650
02:09:28,181 --> 02:09:31,202
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the care and attention that go into the costumes.

1651
02:09:31,723 --> 02:09:33,183
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just some art I don't need to see.

1652
02:09:33,784 --> 02:09:34,824
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're welcome to draw it.

1653
02:09:35,384 --> 02:09:36,025
[SPEAKER_13]: I just won't look at it.

1654
02:09:37,545 --> 02:09:39,186
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my approach toward any fandom.

1655
02:09:39,746 --> 02:09:41,507
[SPEAKER_13]: You can enjoy your fandom, enjoy your ship.

1656
02:09:41,627 --> 02:09:42,287
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have to look at it.

1657
02:09:42,767 --> 02:09:43,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.

1658
02:09:43,788 --> 02:09:44,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Muppets.

1659
02:09:45,409 --> 02:09:48,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't like Muppets, you know?

1660
02:09:48,977 --> 02:09:51,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Trust me, if it exists, someone has slashed it.

1661
02:09:52,221 --> 02:09:53,103
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the internet.

1662
02:09:54,344 --> 02:09:55,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1663
02:09:56,087 --> 02:10:01,153
[SPEAKER_13]: This is from... I'm just going to say Sam because I don't sign it.

1664
02:10:01,394 --> 02:10:02,114
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just Sam.

1665
02:10:03,416 --> 02:10:04,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, OLR crew.

1666
02:10:04,478 --> 02:10:05,178
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the show.

1667
02:10:05,199 --> 02:10:05,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Sam.

1668
02:10:05,779 --> 02:10:06,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Sam.

1669
02:10:07,517 --> 02:10:09,939
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we have also made that point on the show, I do agree.

1670
02:10:29,861 --> 02:10:32,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because you have a system don't mean people's gonna put shit on it.

1671
02:10:33,143 --> 02:10:33,564
[SPEAKER_13]: In the story.

1672
02:10:34,264 --> 02:10:35,185
[SPEAKER_13]: I ain't got time for that shit.

1673
02:10:36,526 --> 02:10:37,767
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, last email?

1674
02:10:38,948 --> 02:10:39,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

1675
02:10:40,109 --> 02:10:45,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, OLR crew, I wanted to tip my hat in along with Loki and Sky's complaints about Nintendo's game from episode 503.

1676
02:10:46,693 --> 02:10:54,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Both of you brought up perfectly valid points, and I want to bring up an issue, too, namely with Nintendo not putting enough content in their games to make them feel, quote, complete.

1677
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:55,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1678
02:10:55,700 --> 02:11:01,684
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, Wii Sports Resort was touted to be a major upgrade from the first Wii Sports.

1679
02:11:02,285 --> 02:11:10,150
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't own Wii Sports Resort, though after taking a look at the FAQ for it, I'm convinced it's just a small step up with all the new minigames included.

1680
02:11:10,570 --> 02:11:25,360
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand Wii Sports and other Nintendo games that typically star Miis are intended for casual audiences, but why won't Nintendo put in effort to toss in features aside from online multiplayer, like your Mii having stats that affect gameplay or a complete fleshed out tournament mode?

1681
02:11:25,780 --> 02:11:32,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Not only would these features appeal to core players, it would give the casuals a sense of progress and an enticing reason to come back to the game.

1682
02:11:40,881 --> 02:12:08,128
[SPEAKER_05]: for real like I really wish Nintendo would it just pisses me off Nintendo needs to steal some people from Microsoft or even Sony that get online better that get the enhanced value of it it really it just pains me that Nintendo won't try to advance the social aspect of gaming online but then again they made buku bucks off of party games so you know what whatever works for them right

1683
02:12:09,418 --> 02:12:15,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's also Nintendo, which I think still refuses to... It's like they put... We're not crossing the line.

1684
02:12:15,787 --> 02:12:16,368
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not crossing the line.

1685
02:12:16,488 --> 02:12:18,211
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll touch the line, but we aren't crossing it.

1686
02:12:19,493 --> 02:12:20,474
[SPEAKER_13]: We do things our way.

1687
02:12:20,734 --> 02:12:22,116
[SPEAKER_13]: We do things the Miyamoto way.

1688
02:12:24,429 --> 02:12:29,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I also believe my beef with Nintendo applies to some of the flagship games too New Super Mario Bros.

1689
02:12:29,593 --> 02:12:41,502
[SPEAKER_13]: U only unlocks one extra world after you beat the game whereas Super Mario 3D Land put up another 8 whole worlds that are substantially tougher substantially I'm all tongue tied

1690
02:12:42,322 --> 02:12:47,424
[SPEAKER_13]: and how many people know that the upcoming Super Luigi U DLC only allows 100 seconds per stage?

1691
02:12:48,025 --> 02:12:54,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Hearing that gives me the impression Nintendo is being cheap by not offering stages of standard length.

1692
02:12:55,528 --> 02:12:56,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we do like it long.

1693
02:12:58,149 --> 02:13:00,971
[SPEAKER_13]: OLR Crew, please cheer me up by answering this question.

1694
02:13:01,531 --> 02:13:04,332
[SPEAKER_13]: What are some of the games you've invested an assload of time into?

1695
02:13:05,993 --> 02:13:07,153
[SPEAKER_05]: No, stay mad.

1696
02:13:08,734 --> 02:13:09,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

1697
02:13:09,254 --> 02:13:09,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll answer.

1698
02:13:09,795 --> 02:13:10,335
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the rest of it?

1699
02:13:10,802 --> 02:13:15,367
[SPEAKER_13]: I personally sunk somewhere over 2,000 hours into Phantasy Star Online a few years ago.

1700
02:13:16,008 --> 02:13:19,492
[SPEAKER_13]: And more recently, I played The Binding of Isaac for over 600 hours.

1701
02:13:20,013 --> 02:13:22,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Stay fresh, everyone, and don't be a cudwafter.

1702
02:13:23,136 --> 02:13:24,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Spelled like the type that cows chew.

1703
02:13:24,918 --> 02:13:25,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1704
02:13:25,819 --> 02:13:26,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Cudwafter!

1705
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:27,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Cudwafter!

1706
02:13:27,501 --> 02:13:29,804
[SPEAKER_13]: That's gonna be my favorite game name ever.

1707
02:13:30,544 --> 02:13:31,766
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's from The Nasty Canasta.

1708
02:13:32,306 --> 02:13:34,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is one of my favorite listener names, by the way.

1709
02:13:35,708 --> 02:13:39,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I always just imagine a game of like strip canasta, like the card game.

1710
02:13:39,109 --> 02:13:39,429
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.

1711
02:13:39,789 --> 02:13:40,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Strip canasta?

1712
02:13:40,730 --> 02:13:41,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's nasty canasta.

1713
02:13:43,611 --> 02:13:44,351
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the card game?

1714
02:13:44,451 --> 02:13:45,072
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, forget it.

1715
02:13:45,232 --> 02:13:45,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1716
02:13:46,012 --> 02:13:46,732
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1717
02:13:48,113 --> 02:13:49,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like dirty pinochle.

1718
02:13:49,193 --> 02:13:50,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Pino, pinochle?

1719
02:13:56,451 --> 02:14:00,754
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like your sister or brother would be a dirty pinochle.

1720
02:14:02,936 --> 02:14:04,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, what was the question?

1721
02:14:04,957 --> 02:14:05,838
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't even ask for that.

1722
02:14:05,938 --> 02:14:06,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck, I just closed it.

1723
02:14:07,459 --> 02:14:10,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what game have you... Sunk a lot of time into.

1724
02:14:10,741 --> 02:14:14,544
[SPEAKER_05]: World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XI, and insert MMO here.

1725
02:14:14,824 --> 02:14:18,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect 3, a disgusting amount with a multiplayer, has really enhanced that.

1726
02:14:18,245 --> 02:14:20,265
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm actually going to be starting over on the whole series again.

1727
02:14:20,385 --> 02:14:30,708
[SPEAKER_13]: I am going to keep Dramamine by my computer and play through the first Mass Effect again because I love the story in it best of any of them, but I get so damn motion sick.

1728
02:14:31,208 --> 02:14:33,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I turn off the film grain.

1729
02:14:33,089 --> 02:14:36,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I turn off the wiggle, whatever, the motion blur.

1730
02:14:37,070 --> 02:14:40,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Still get sicker than anything on the stupid Mako missions.

1731
02:14:40,670 --> 02:14:41,411
[SPEAKER_05]: What about you, Loki?

1732
02:14:41,911 --> 02:14:42,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto?

1733
02:14:43,208 --> 02:14:55,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto, Earth Defense Force, Saints Row, and even Call of Duty because we played it for multiplayer, but I don't play a ton of that.

1734
02:14:57,120 --> 02:14:58,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably Grand Theft Auto 4.

1735
02:14:58,762 --> 02:14:59,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of fun.

1736
02:14:59,603 --> 02:14:59,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1737
02:15:01,817 --> 02:15:09,683
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually, it's funny that I was talking to Dan about me playing Ragnarok Online 2 because, you know, he's like, well, you only played the first one for 10 years, which is true.

1738
02:15:11,164 --> 02:15:11,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Something like that.

1739
02:15:11,945 --> 02:15:28,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I played Ragnarok Online since it was in the Japanese beta because I started playing in Japanese and then I moved over to IRO when they opened the beta here and then I played through paid IRO and then I went to free servers and

1740
02:15:29,338 --> 02:15:34,463
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I'm actually one of the few people that would still have my original account intact because I was a beta tester.

1741
02:15:35,284 --> 02:15:35,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.

1742
02:15:35,804 --> 02:15:35,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1743
02:15:36,705 --> 02:15:38,267
[SPEAKER_13]: That was another one that ate a lot of my time.

1744
02:15:38,707 --> 02:15:39,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Civilization 1.

1745
02:15:40,129 --> 02:15:41,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a disgusting amount of that on PC.

1746
02:15:42,151 --> 02:15:43,372
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not surprised at all.

1747
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:44,020
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1748
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:45,561
[SPEAKER_05]: More emails?

1749
02:15:45,681 --> 02:15:46,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was that it?

1750
02:15:46,181 --> 02:15:46,601
[SPEAKER_13]: That was it.

1751
02:15:46,761 --> 02:15:50,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I can't believe I didn't even say this.

1752
02:15:51,582 --> 02:15:55,964
[SPEAKER_13]: I would play Super Street Fighter 2 on my SNES like all the time.

1753
02:15:57,124 --> 02:15:59,345
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have people over like, we're going to play games.

1754
02:15:59,425 --> 02:16:00,725
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not playing Super Street Fighter 2.

1755
02:16:01,105 --> 02:16:02,246
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, okay, Kirby's Avalanche.

1756
02:16:02,946 --> 02:16:05,387
[SPEAKER_13]: But those were my two SNES day.

1757
02:16:05,707 --> 02:16:06,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

1758
02:16:07,447 --> 02:16:07,707
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1759
02:16:07,968 --> 02:16:08,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to the FUs of the week.

1760
02:16:25,370 --> 02:16:26,850
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

1761
02:16:29,651 --> 02:16:34,273
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a few FUs because I have been carrying quite a bit of angst this past week.

1762
02:16:35,233 --> 02:16:38,194
[SPEAKER_13]: FU number one goes to my stupid allergies.

1763
02:16:38,454 --> 02:16:39,914
[SPEAKER_13]: I have developed a weed allergy.

1764
02:16:40,654 --> 02:16:42,335
[SPEAKER_13]: And Dan brought me donuts last night.

1765
02:16:42,415 --> 02:16:43,475
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, donuts?

1766
02:16:43,515 --> 02:16:44,655
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll eat the hell out of those.

1767
02:16:44,856 --> 02:16:45,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope, sick.

1768
02:16:46,916 --> 02:16:49,377
[SPEAKER_13]: And then to plane ticket costs because...

1769
02:16:50,057 --> 02:16:51,458
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1770
02:17:13,237 --> 02:17:14,839
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I was thinking, well, you know what?

1771
02:17:14,939 --> 02:17:23,028
[SPEAKER_13]: If I stay a full two weeks, arrive on a Tuesday, leave on a Tuesday, yeah, that's going to be a lot better for my cost.

1772
02:17:23,088 --> 02:17:23,289
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1773
02:17:24,029 --> 02:17:25,211
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm leaving on a Thursday.

1774
02:17:25,271 --> 02:17:30,216
[SPEAKER_13]: If I stayed until Tuesday the following week, it would have bumped my ticket up by like another $150.

1775
02:17:31,838 --> 02:17:32,739
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1776
02:17:48,798 --> 02:17:53,002
[SPEAKER_13]: and as much as I would love to ride the train, I don't have that kind of time.

1777
02:17:53,142 --> 02:18:03,510
[SPEAKER_13]: I even paid an extra $35 so that I could get the shortest flight possible because the flights it wanted to give me at the lowest price possible were something like 10 hours, including two layovers.

1778
02:18:03,570 --> 02:18:08,014
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, at the moment I see the Atlanta airport on there, I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1779
02:18:08,074 --> 02:18:11,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Atlanta airport is like the bane of my existence.

1780
02:18:11,056 --> 02:18:11,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1781
02:18:12,117 --> 02:18:15,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't tell me this because I have to fly to Atlanta for DragonCon.

1782
02:18:15,921 --> 02:18:16,341
[SPEAKER_13]: No, Rob.

1783
02:18:17,142 --> 02:18:22,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Just one awesome thing, though, is the never-ending escalator that just goes up.

1784
02:18:23,347 --> 02:18:25,489
[SPEAKER_13]: You cannot see the end of it for like an hour.

1785
02:18:25,929 --> 02:18:28,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I refuse to believe anything is worse than the Philadelphia airport.

1786
02:18:29,232 --> 02:18:30,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Thankfully, I've not done the Philadelphia airport.

1787
02:18:31,034 --> 02:18:31,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty bad.

1788
02:18:32,015 --> 02:18:35,878
[SPEAKER_13]: But I still think to this day my favorite airport for layout would have to be Burbank.

1789
02:18:36,553 --> 02:18:37,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I love Burbank.

1790
02:18:37,254 --> 02:18:38,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Burbank's so easy.

1791
02:18:38,094 --> 02:18:38,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Burbank, yeah.

1792
02:18:38,935 --> 02:18:41,396
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I always call it.

1793
02:18:41,556 --> 02:18:45,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Believe it or not, Dallas-Fort Worth is actually a really well laid out airport.

1794
02:18:45,959 --> 02:18:47,841
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can get rides on the little golf carts.

1795
02:18:49,328 --> 02:18:50,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about airports.

1796
02:18:51,809 --> 02:18:53,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and then my last one.

1797
02:18:53,970 --> 02:18:56,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I use this with a disclaimer.

1798
02:18:56,171 --> 02:18:57,091
[SPEAKER_13]: I love my kitten.

1799
02:18:57,752 --> 02:18:59,392
[SPEAKER_13]: My baby is so sweet.

1800
02:18:59,872 --> 02:19:03,994
[SPEAKER_13]: But she had claws on her and clawed the crap out of my leg.

1801
02:19:04,334 --> 02:19:05,855
[SPEAKER_13]: She was pouncing my feet.

1802
02:19:05,915 --> 02:19:06,915
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd walk by, pounce.

1803
02:19:07,576 --> 02:19:11,557
[SPEAKER_13]: And then she decided that she was going to claw up my calf, so finally we sat her down.

1804
02:19:11,957 --> 02:19:18,540
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Dan's holding her, and I'm trying to clip her little claws, and she's wiggling and moving her paws out of the way.

1805
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:21,322
[SPEAKER_13]: and making the most god-awful noise.

1806
02:19:21,582 --> 02:19:22,003
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like this.

1807
02:19:24,985 --> 02:19:25,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, lordy.

1808
02:19:25,826 --> 02:19:26,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that noise.

1809
02:19:27,347 --> 02:19:28,808
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, Mimi.

1810
02:19:29,149 --> 02:19:29,929
[SPEAKER_13]: And then she runs off.

1811
02:19:29,949 --> 02:19:31,711
[SPEAKER_13]: And the first thing, you know what she does once I'm done with her?

1812
02:19:31,731 --> 02:19:35,574
[SPEAKER_13]: The first thing she does is goes into her room, looks at her bowl and says, you're giving me a treat, woman.

1813
02:19:37,367 --> 02:19:37,868
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did.

1814
02:19:38,508 --> 02:19:38,829
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1815
02:19:39,850 --> 02:19:40,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1816
02:19:41,572 --> 02:19:46,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess FU to McDonald's for not getting orders correct.

1817
02:19:47,258 --> 02:19:47,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

1818
02:19:47,678 --> 02:19:48,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

1819
02:19:49,540 --> 02:19:49,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1820
02:19:49,741 --> 02:19:49,981
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1821
02:19:50,001 --> 02:19:53,485
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week goes to The Scale for telling me the truth.

1822
02:19:55,206 --> 02:19:57,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time, lie to me and make me feel better about myself, asshole.

1823
02:19:59,867 --> 02:20:03,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to a couple more news stories, and then we're going to open up the sky blind.

1824
02:20:03,548 --> 02:20:04,408
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, Loki.

1825
02:20:04,929 --> 02:20:14,632
[SPEAKER_06]: So, he has gotten some more funding, not necessarily from Kickstarter, but from some outside investors, including NVIDIA, actually.

1826
02:20:14,992 --> 02:20:24,314
[SPEAKER_06]: NVIDIA is investing money in Luya, as well as the Mayfield Fund, Shasta Ventures, and the OCAM Partners, who I have no fucking clue who they are, but...

1827
02:20:26,295 --> 02:20:30,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so they've got another $15 million, which will help them launch retail.

1828
02:20:30,596 --> 02:20:46,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, their retail launch, as I expected, was delayed to June 25th, as opposed to June 4th, because there's no fucking way they would ever hit that target with how fast they're shipping the Kickstarter backers, and then on top of that, the people that pre-ordered on OUYA.TV.

1829
02:20:48,741 --> 02:20:56,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And they say they have 12,000 developers who have registered to make an Ouya game.

1830
02:20:57,148 --> 02:21:03,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not necessarily 12,000 games that are out there, but 12,000 people that are possibly going to make a game.

1831
02:21:04,995 --> 02:21:05,756
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

1832
02:21:08,151 --> 02:21:11,473
[SPEAKER_06]: They claim they're ahead of schedule, but I don't buy it.

1833
02:21:12,434 --> 02:21:13,895
[SPEAKER_06]: How much did you play your Ouya this week?

1834
02:21:14,835 --> 02:21:15,296
[SPEAKER_06]: For a little bit.

1835
02:21:15,356 --> 02:21:19,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember how long it was, though, but I checked out... What did I check out this week?

1836
02:21:19,399 --> 02:21:21,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I downloaded this frog game that's supposed to be pretty fun.

1837
02:21:23,241 --> 02:21:31,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I played more of the Pingu Puzzle Poker, which I may be writing a review on that at some point.

1838
02:21:31,487 --> 02:21:34,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to yet because it's still beta.

1839
02:21:34,889 --> 02:21:38,091
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the finished game, so you don't want to do that.

1840
02:21:41,336 --> 02:21:48,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I played some I just downloaded some more stuff I don't really remember playing any other games there's a few I tried that were kind of lame but I don't remember exactly what they were

1841
02:21:50,717 --> 02:21:51,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Still haven't played Final Fantasy 3.

1842
02:21:52,678 --> 02:21:53,178
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

1843
02:21:53,778 --> 02:21:54,018
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1844
02:21:54,778 --> 02:21:57,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, moving on to one more story tonight.

1845
02:21:57,519 --> 02:22:02,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is about a comment from Bobby Kotick, who is the CEO of Activision.

1846
02:22:03,061 --> 02:22:10,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And saying in an earnings call this week where they were talking about the loss of WoW subscribers and so forth.

1847
02:22:10,723 --> 02:22:12,944
[SPEAKER_05]: But this isn't about PC stuff or WoW.

1848
02:22:12,964 --> 02:22:13,904
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about console.

1849
02:22:14,584 --> 02:22:19,746
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about the new consoles, Xbox, Lube, Infinity, 720, whatever you want to call it.

1850
02:22:20,026 --> 02:22:22,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Loobfinity, and the PlayStation 4.

1851
02:22:23,489 --> 02:22:40,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, there are still many unknown factors such as pricing, launch dates, and quantities, the level of first-party support, and importantly, consumer purchase intent in a world where consoles are no longer just competing with each other, but also with new platforms such as smartphones and tablets.

1852
02:22:40,785 --> 02:22:45,789
[SPEAKER_05]: He also went on to say that Wii U had a, quote, very slow start and uncertainties

1853
02:22:46,750 --> 02:22:54,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, no Call of Duty ghosts on Wii U either.

1854
02:22:54,895 --> 02:22:56,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

1855
02:22:58,457 --> 02:23:00,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, yeah, it's a very big possibility.

1856
02:23:00,358 --> 02:23:08,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, though, it's less going to be, oh, I have a smartphone and tablet, I can play these games on here, which no one's actually thinking that.

1857
02:23:09,143 --> 02:23:29,897
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think it's more of why do I need to buy an next-gen console because Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out right then or hey I want to play Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty Ghosts hey guess what those are both on current gen consoles or Assassin's Creed you know Black Flag oh current gen consoles you know or Watch Dogs current gen as well so it's like why do I need to buy a new console for these

1858
02:23:29,997 --> 02:23:59,658
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're going to have to figure out this whole what am I going to do with another console you know when I want to play all the old games and they're not backwards compatible they showed footage of Black Flag on the Playstation 4 you can't tell the difference you can't tell the difference between the Playstation 3 and Playstation 4 version of that game I'm sure it's other like simulation like physics stuff in there but I don't know I can't really tell much of a difference um

1859
02:24:02,805 --> 02:24:03,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost my train of thought.

1860
02:24:07,321 --> 02:24:08,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe first party games?

1861
02:24:08,541 --> 02:24:08,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1862
02:24:09,982 --> 02:24:10,782
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that might help.

1863
02:24:11,302 --> 02:24:13,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean, they're going to have some exclusive first party stuff.

1864
02:24:13,683 --> 02:24:17,024
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's, once again, it kind of sells systems.

1865
02:24:17,484 --> 02:24:18,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I remembered what I was going to say.

1866
02:24:18,604 --> 02:24:24,026
[SPEAKER_05]: There's rumors about this new Xbox, whatever it's called, that there's an HDMI pass-through port on it.

1867
02:24:24,086 --> 02:24:24,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard about this?

1868
02:24:24,846 --> 02:24:29,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Where, you know, you'll be able to save an HDMI thing because you can use the pass-through port.

1869
02:24:30,087 --> 02:24:32,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be funny if that only worked with a 360?

1870
02:24:33,388 --> 02:24:33,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Outro Music

1871
02:24:55,836 --> 02:25:03,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, they wouldn't necessarily openly say that, but... Nah, I don't think they could even do... They don't do that.

1872
02:25:03,939 --> 02:25:06,659
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, actually, they don't really have an encrypted HDMI.

1873
02:25:06,779 --> 02:25:08,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It's PlayStation 3 that does.

1874
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:14,302
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, if you try to do video capture through HDMI, you can't do that on the PlayStation 3.

1875
02:25:14,802 --> 02:25:16,102
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only do that on the 360.

1876
02:25:16,242 --> 02:25:24,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you might be able to do it on the PlayStation 3 up to a certain... Maybe not 1080p, but I know you can't do 1080p through HDMI on the PS3.

1877
02:25:25,625 --> 02:25:27,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see them doing that.

1878
02:25:27,565 --> 02:25:33,246
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still going to be very awkward with another console sitting next to your console to do back to compatibility.

1879
02:25:33,527 --> 02:25:34,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't worry about it and just say, you know what?

1880
02:25:35,687 --> 02:25:36,547
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to drop the price of the 360.

1881
02:25:37,087 --> 02:25:37,627
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a 360.

1882
02:25:38,427 --> 02:25:39,428
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to sell it.

1883
02:25:39,508 --> 02:25:43,768
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just hold on to it and play your games on that.

1884
02:25:43,848 --> 02:25:44,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know.

1885
02:25:45,129 --> 02:25:47,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they'll have a solution for it at some point.

1886
02:25:47,209 --> 02:25:50,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see it as that big a deal because I'm not really going to get rid of my 360.

1887
02:25:52,537 --> 02:25:54,719
[SPEAKER_05]: MM2K in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1888
02:26:11,836 --> 02:26:12,457
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be.

1889
02:26:13,117 --> 02:26:19,322
[SPEAKER_06]: We may have a Wii U situation where it's just, hey, there's the launch titles and not a whole ton.

1890
02:26:19,522 --> 02:26:32,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think we're going to see more third-party games, but I think it's going to be a lot of this, it's on PS4 and it's on PS3 because they're worried that, oh, well, we may not make up the sales on just a PlayStation 4 exclusive game.

1891
02:26:32,632 --> 02:26:36,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's going to be a real big issue is you're going to say, well...

1892
02:26:37,595 --> 02:27:01,643
[SPEAKER_06]: especially if like if the Assassin's Creed thing I mean I'm sure it looks similar to the PC version probably exactly like the PC version but I haven't seen the PS3 version running next to the PS4 version so I can't say that it's like night and day but it doesn't look from what they showed it doesn't look night and day based off the trailers it looks exactly the same but I mean I think the trailers are captured off of the PC so you know that's not a surprise there

1893
02:27:02,202 --> 02:27:02,482
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1894
02:27:02,983 --> 02:27:04,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's open up the Skype line, guys.

1895
02:27:05,045 --> 02:27:05,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Call us.

1896
02:27:06,007 --> 02:27:08,630
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the last we have on our list for the show tonight.

1897
02:27:09,291 --> 02:27:10,672
[SPEAKER_05]: But what do you guys want to talk about?

1898
02:27:10,692 --> 02:27:15,638
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1899
02:27:16,079 --> 02:27:21,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got an email on my little emails from Joe from earlier in the show thanking us for having him on.

1900
02:27:21,727 --> 02:27:23,389
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a fun interview.

1901
02:27:24,510 --> 02:27:32,957
[SPEAKER_05]: If you missed the interview earlier, be sure to download it on the podcast feed or check it out on a streaming solution like Stitcher or TuneIn, one of your favorite apps there.

1902
02:27:33,838 --> 02:27:41,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call and say hello and talk about whatever's going on in your mind this week.

1903
02:27:44,121 --> 02:27:45,002
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go to the phones.

1904
02:27:45,062 --> 02:27:46,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1905
02:27:46,363 --> 02:27:46,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1906
02:27:47,424 --> 02:27:48,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, it's Zaku here.

1907
02:27:48,345 --> 02:27:49,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Zaku.

1908
02:27:49,566 --> 02:27:50,306
[SPEAKER_05]: We see you.

1909
02:27:50,326 --> 02:27:50,987
[SPEAKER_05]: How's everyone?

1910
02:27:51,187 --> 02:27:52,548
[SPEAKER_05]: How's everything going?

1911
02:27:52,728 --> 02:27:53,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, good.

1912
02:27:54,450 --> 02:27:55,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we see you in studio.

1913
02:27:55,811 --> 02:27:56,471
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you're here.

1914
02:27:56,571 --> 02:27:56,912
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

1915
02:27:58,413 --> 02:28:04,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing much, just catching up on some post-Mother's Day gaming.

1916
02:28:05,439 --> 02:28:10,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Dug up my old PS2 to play some San Andreas after like a three-year hiatus.

1917
02:28:10,737 --> 02:28:11,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Some classics.

1918
02:28:11,598 --> 02:28:13,880
[SPEAKER_05]: You know my Grand Theft Auto 4 is still in the shrink wrap.

1919
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:15,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't believe you just called that a classic, Rob.

1920
02:28:16,703 --> 02:28:17,444
[SPEAKER_08]: It is, isn't it?

1921
02:28:17,644 --> 02:28:19,306
[SPEAKER_13]: It's almost 10 years old.

1922
02:28:19,486 --> 02:28:22,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you're talking about a game that's almost a decade old.

1923
02:28:22,850 --> 02:28:23,951
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of classic.

1924
02:28:24,151 --> 02:28:24,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, what?

1925
02:28:25,032 --> 02:28:28,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Even 3 and Vice City are pretty much classic at this point.

1926
02:28:29,195 --> 02:28:31,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you haven't played Grand Theft Auto 4.

1927
02:28:31,957 --> 02:28:34,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Go play Grand Theft Auto 4.

1928
02:28:34,619 --> 02:28:36,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I think I did a little bit.

1929
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:37,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

1930
02:28:37,881 --> 02:28:40,522
[SPEAKER_05]: If I did, it was a long time ago when it first came out.

1931
02:28:41,383 --> 02:28:50,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's... At the very least, if you're going to participate in the VOG gaming night this week, you do need to play past the first few missions, I think, in order to get the multiplayer options.

1932
02:28:50,469 --> 02:28:55,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I got really far in GTA 4, and then I lost my 360 copy, so now I have to start again for my PC.

1933
02:28:56,673 --> 02:28:58,714
[SPEAKER_08]: and the one that I have on Steam.

1934
02:28:58,854 --> 02:29:01,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be funny though, Loki, if I started playing and I got totally addicted to it?

1935
02:29:02,155 --> 02:29:02,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

1936
02:29:02,776 --> 02:29:03,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It seriously is.

1937
02:29:04,316 --> 02:29:05,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like hoes.

1938
02:29:06,397 --> 02:29:07,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear there's lots of hoes in Grand Theft Auto 4.

1939
02:29:07,978 --> 02:29:09,299
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, Rob, you like ho-hoes.

1940
02:29:09,959 --> 02:29:10,519
[SPEAKER_13]: It's different.

1941
02:29:10,579 --> 02:29:12,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you're calling me fat.

1942
02:29:14,401 --> 02:29:15,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Zaku.

1943
02:29:15,281 --> 02:29:16,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're playing San Andreas.

1944
02:29:18,342 --> 02:29:23,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just catching up on that and basically trying to juggle my queue.

1945
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:25,452
[SPEAKER_08]: But I digress.

1946
02:29:25,973 --> 02:29:32,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess part of what I wanted to bring up was the fact that the whole next-gen...

1947
02:29:35,199 --> 02:29:52,428
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole next-gen issues with some of the folks who are part of it, like Nintendo basically bet the whole barn on the Wii U, and so far it's like EA's pushing back, Activision may, as you've already stated, may be on its way out.

1948
02:29:52,468 --> 02:30:04,634
[SPEAKER_08]: So it pretty much goes to the point where did Nintendo intend for this to be a Hail Mary because they were getting outgunned by the fact that the Wii was so far behind this current gen?

1949
02:30:06,576 --> 02:30:10,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but there's a part of me that wonders if it's not a bridge console.

1950
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:18,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And I threw that idea out because they invested so much in this gamepad and it wasn't just the same type of stuff you saw on the Wii.

1951
02:30:18,787 --> 02:30:27,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if we had just seen literally a quote-unquote super Wii, it would have been more of a bridge console, which is what I honestly thought we were going to get.

1952
02:30:27,374 --> 02:30:29,716
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we got the gamepad, I was like, oh, maybe not.

1953
02:30:29,756 --> 02:30:30,957
[SPEAKER_05]: But now I'm starting to wonder again.

1954
02:30:31,778 --> 02:30:32,399
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other hand...

1955
02:30:55,221 --> 02:31:05,749
[SPEAKER_08]: The word on the street is that Microsoft actually at the last minute, it looks like they're going to ditch the whole always online requirement.

1956
02:31:07,651 --> 02:31:08,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Funny how that happened.

1957
02:31:09,893 --> 02:31:20,761
[SPEAKER_08]: It works in their favor in the sense that Sony basically was forced to, since the fact that they went early, it makes it easier for

1958
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:22,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1959
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:49,457
[SPEAKER_08]: and then all of a sudden they could just go in at the very last minute and announce all the things, pretty much dispel every rumor that's been going on for almost the past year and they could pretty much be on par, if not slightly above, going into E3.

1960
02:31:49,497 --> 02:31:52,320
[SPEAKER_06]: They could do that, but they probably won't.

1961
02:31:53,482 --> 02:31:54,743
[SPEAKER_08]: On the other hand, think about it.

1962
02:31:54,763 --> 02:31:59,309
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I'm hearing, it's pretty much the same console.

1963
02:31:59,329 --> 02:32:01,752
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all going to be running Blu-rays.

1964
02:32:01,772 --> 02:32:03,154
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all going to have 8 gigs of RAM.

1965
02:32:03,835 --> 02:32:06,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Although one of them may require more things than others.

1966
02:32:07,319 --> 02:32:07,499
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1967
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:34,045
[SPEAKER_08]: If the rumors end up becoming true where they ditch online, then that might just bring around some of the folks who are on the fence who pretty much didn't abandon Sony, but at the same time they pretty much had the thoughts that if they had to go on and defend this lipstick on a pig by making sure, by defending always online, then yeah, it would have been sweet to Sony, but...

1968
02:32:36,435 --> 02:32:45,538
[SPEAKER_08]: If by E3 Microsoft basically pulls what they have to, they could pretty much be neck and neck.

1969
02:32:45,578 --> 02:32:52,321
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost like an election where you try to blackball the other guy, you try to throw mud, and then all of a sudden...

1970
02:32:54,717 --> 02:33:01,240
[SPEAKER_08]: You do an event where you're pretty much even in the polls.

1971
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:02,740
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I think of it.

1972
02:33:06,721 --> 02:33:10,423
[SPEAKER_05]: You think Nintendo or Sony started that rumor about Microsoft always being online?

1973
02:33:11,263 --> 02:33:13,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking it's Microsoft themselves.

1974
02:33:13,344 --> 02:33:17,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is coming from their developers who not only...

1975
02:33:18,306 --> 02:33:22,893
[SPEAKER_08]: from third-party devs that managed to get their hands on the early dev kits.

1976
02:33:22,953 --> 02:33:25,356
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially that guy, that product manager that opened his mouth

1977
02:33:30,140 --> 02:33:31,701
[SPEAKER_08]: On Twitter, that didn't help.

1978
02:33:32,261 --> 02:33:35,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Zaku, here's the thing about Nintendo, Zaku.

1979
02:33:35,702 --> 02:33:42,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not willing to write them off yet until... Because if they price drop at E3, the game is afoot again.

1980
02:33:42,524 --> 02:33:45,105
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a whole new game, level 2.

1981
02:33:45,925 --> 02:33:50,046
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 3DS all over again if they price drop at E3, which is highly likely, I think.

1982
02:33:50,746 --> 02:33:55,528
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, it's starting to shape up like a two-horse race at this point.

1983
02:33:56,431 --> 02:34:00,032
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 Horse Race in the sense of the next generation

1984
02:34:19,964 --> 02:34:21,265
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it is.

1985
02:34:21,525 --> 02:34:21,965
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.

1986
02:34:22,025 --> 02:34:26,326
[SPEAKER_08]: There is an argument to be made to keep what you currently have in this generation.

1987
02:34:26,366 --> 02:34:33,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell, I'm not even almost half a year into my PS3 right there that my girl got me this past Christmas.

1988
02:34:34,748 --> 02:34:42,769
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still fresh to me knowing the fact that I had my other platforms to juggle before the PS3.

1989
02:34:43,610 --> 02:34:44,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still chewing on that.

1990
02:34:45,464 --> 02:34:49,748
[SPEAKER_08]: So may I get, you know, will I be getting one of those new, you know, new consoles?

1991
02:34:49,928 --> 02:34:50,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Not likely.

1992
02:34:50,749 --> 02:34:51,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet.

1993
02:34:52,191 --> 02:34:53,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually I just wait a while.

1994
02:34:54,551 --> 02:34:57,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I will, most likely, because I'm a consumer whore.

1995
02:34:57,794 --> 02:35:00,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Going into this next gen, it might be a two horse race.

1996
02:35:01,937 --> 02:35:02,617
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see.

1997
02:35:02,857 --> 02:35:05,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's have this conversation again after E3 and see what happens.

1998
02:35:05,399 --> 02:35:06,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Speculation right now.

1999
02:35:06,580 --> 02:35:08,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Zaku, I'm going to let you go to get more calls.

2000
02:35:08,842 --> 02:35:09,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

2001
02:35:10,043 --> 02:35:12,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2002
02:35:13,285 --> 02:35:13,566
[SPEAKER_05]: He's right.

2003
02:35:13,606 --> 02:35:14,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all speculation right now.

2004
02:35:14,967 --> 02:35:15,907
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that part he's right.

2005
02:35:16,208 --> 02:35:17,468
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all speculation right now.

2006
02:35:17,488 --> 02:35:18,789
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way too early to say.

2007
02:35:19,550 --> 02:35:19,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

2008
02:35:21,263 --> 02:35:22,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, it's a trumpet!

2009
02:35:50,925 --> 02:35:54,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, Bobby's on webcam and he's actually got his cartridge.

2010
02:35:54,989 --> 02:35:55,750
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

2011
02:35:56,110 --> 02:35:57,091
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a trumpet, Rob.

2012
02:35:59,293 --> 02:36:01,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Mother's Day to you too, Mom.

2013
02:36:01,355 --> 02:36:02,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Mother's Day.

2014
02:36:04,538 --> 02:36:05,839
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, Bobby?

2015
02:36:06,159 --> 02:36:07,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to tell you it was a trumpet.

2016
02:36:09,202 --> 02:36:10,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was a drumstick with you.

2017
02:36:12,247 --> 02:36:12,888
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2018
02:36:34,161 --> 02:36:35,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you a happy anniversary of your hatching

2019
02:36:51,906 --> 02:36:54,088
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2020
02:37:08,004 --> 02:37:13,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I was too hypnotized by the music of Professor Shy Guy who was fun on your show.

2021
02:37:13,206 --> 02:37:15,046
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been Kickstarter night on VOG tonight.

2022
02:37:15,126 --> 02:37:16,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2023
02:37:16,427 --> 02:37:20,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, everybody check that out because he's a great guy.

2024
02:37:20,468 --> 02:37:25,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually seen him perform before and he was the person playing when GLaDOS made me get on a dance floor.

2025
02:37:27,033 --> 02:37:28,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, I remember that story.

2026
02:37:28,734 --> 02:37:35,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now that all ties together, because I know he was talking about Elle McClain, who is a confirmed guest of GamerX.

2027
02:37:35,516 --> 02:37:39,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe I will finally get to meet her in August at that whole thing.

2028
02:37:39,578 --> 02:37:40,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited about that.

2029
02:37:40,898 --> 02:37:43,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can name drop me, and she'll be like, oh yeah, I remember him.

2030
02:37:43,880 --> 02:37:45,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I will absolutely name drop you.

2031
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:46,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be like, yeah, we're on the same network.

2032
02:37:46,781 --> 02:37:47,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good times.

2033
02:37:48,841 --> 02:37:51,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we may get Professor Shy Guy at DragonCon.

2034
02:37:51,662 --> 02:37:51,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2035
02:37:52,263 --> 02:37:52,783
[SPEAKER_05]: For our thing.

2036
02:37:53,283 --> 02:37:56,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know, we got a lot of conventions coming up.

2037
02:37:56,305 --> 02:37:58,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you getting excited about E3 only a few weeks away?

2038
02:37:59,206 --> 02:37:59,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

2039
02:37:59,846 --> 02:38:00,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet?

2040
02:38:00,647 --> 02:38:00,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

2041
02:38:00,967 --> 02:38:01,667
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a while.

2042
02:38:02,348 --> 02:38:10,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's like right before, because right now it's like I'm getting all the invites to things, so it's like now I'm trying to figure out what I want to schedule and what I don't want to schedule.

2043
02:38:11,852 --> 02:38:13,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, I'm playing all that game right now.

2044
02:38:13,933 --> 02:38:17,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still waiting to hear back from the E3 Pope, but that's my own fault for waiting so long to do it.

2045
02:38:17,775 --> 02:38:19,716
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it is what it is.

2046
02:38:19,736 --> 02:38:20,817
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least we're going to Disneyland.

2047
02:38:21,357 --> 02:38:24,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, I've already got my plane tickets and we'll be going.

2048
02:38:25,001 --> 02:38:26,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else going to join us on that?

2049
02:38:26,623 --> 02:38:27,765
[SPEAKER_04]: It might just be me.

2050
02:38:27,805 --> 02:38:28,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2051
02:38:28,165 --> 02:38:30,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to drag DarkSakura, but I don't know if she's going to be game.

2052
02:38:30,948 --> 02:38:31,289
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

2053
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:35,393
[SPEAKER_13]: I will always go to Disneyland when I can, but I am the unemployed.

2054
02:38:35,534 --> 02:38:36,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

2055
02:38:36,335 --> 02:38:40,119
[SPEAKER_05]: It also depends on if I get blessed by the E3 Pope or not.

2056
02:38:40,299 --> 02:38:43,081
[SPEAKER_05]: If I do, then it will definitely only be you and me.

2057
02:38:43,481 --> 02:38:49,164
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I don't, then that opens up the opportunity that I can be like, hey, you don't have to sit around while I'm at a convention center all day.

2058
02:38:49,244 --> 02:38:51,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to Disneyland for a day or two.

2059
02:38:53,466 --> 02:38:54,867
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out that answer this week.

2060
02:38:55,107 --> 02:38:55,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It better be this week.

2061
02:38:56,488 --> 02:38:56,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

2062
02:38:58,204 --> 02:39:25,749
[SPEAKER_04]: so I just wanted to tell you that it was a trumpet I plug Professor Shy Guy's Kickstarter as well as the Zelda movie Kickstarter because I actually the thing about with Joe and I'm not going to give details or anything I actually do know what he's going to be doing with the movie I know the narrative and what the movie and it's really an interesting take on documentaries is what he's doing he told me that and then he later specifically said don't tell people that yet

2063
02:39:26,462 --> 02:39:27,383
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2064
02:39:46,243 --> 02:39:47,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think he is coming.

2065
02:39:47,524 --> 02:39:49,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, he said Sacramento is one of the places.

2066
02:39:50,125 --> 02:39:50,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2067
02:39:50,646 --> 02:39:51,906
[SPEAKER_04]: That you may be traveling to.

2068
02:39:52,186 --> 02:39:54,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I will have to go check it out.

2069
02:39:54,228 --> 02:39:55,228
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell goes on here?

2070
02:39:55,268 --> 02:39:57,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe SacAnime is getting huge out here.

2071
02:39:57,329 --> 02:40:03,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, SacAnime has been growing, and there's another convention that started up, fuck, I want to say in Rockland.

2072
02:40:03,504 --> 02:40:04,724
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2073
02:40:26,269 --> 02:40:32,151
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually was here to talk to three different Zelda fan groups that were all based in Atlanta.

2074
02:40:32,631 --> 02:40:42,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's coming back because the Symphony of the Goddesses is performing in Atlanta and he's going to do some follow-up stuff with them and do some more follow-up stuff with some of the other Atlanta people as well.

2075
02:40:42,593 --> 02:40:47,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's kind of more meeting the people rather than really going to conventions.

2076
02:40:47,554 --> 02:40:51,495
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just now starting to go to conventions, but he also might be at DragonCon as well.

2077
02:40:51,636 --> 02:40:51,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

2078
02:40:52,116 --> 02:40:52,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

2079
02:40:52,716 --> 02:40:53,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

2080
02:40:53,683 --> 02:40:57,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, Bobby, anything else you want to plug or talk about while you're here?

2081
02:40:59,124 --> 02:41:02,845
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you guys may want to tune in June 2nd during our shows.

2082
02:41:04,605 --> 02:41:05,505
[SPEAKER_04]: For a little something something.

2083
02:41:05,725 --> 02:41:06,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Dot, dot, dot.

2084
02:41:06,546 --> 02:41:07,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Dot, dot, dot.

2085
02:41:07,466 --> 02:41:07,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

2086
02:41:07,826 --> 02:41:08,546
[SPEAKER_05]: To be continued.

2087
02:41:08,886 --> 02:41:09,526
[SPEAKER_05]: To be continued.

2088
02:41:09,546 --> 02:41:12,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, what would June 2nd mark the one year anniversary of?

2089
02:41:12,467 --> 02:41:13,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think.

2090
02:41:13,167 --> 02:41:13,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2091
02:41:13,927 --> 02:41:14,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2092
02:41:14,587 --> 02:41:16,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Bobby, always a pleasure to talk to you.

2093
02:41:17,008 --> 02:41:17,168
[SPEAKER_05]: June 2nd, 2012?

2094
02:41:19,668 --> 02:41:20,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2095
02:41:20,209 --> 02:41:21,990
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be the one-year anniversary of that.

2096
02:41:22,010 --> 02:41:24,491
[SPEAKER_05]: That day is... Oh, shut up, Loki.

2097
02:41:24,531 --> 02:41:24,831
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2098
02:41:25,292 --> 02:41:26,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna let you go, Bobby.

2099
02:41:26,232 --> 02:41:26,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

2100
02:41:26,553 --> 02:41:26,933
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2101
02:41:27,233 --> 02:41:27,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2102
02:41:28,434 --> 02:41:30,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a pleasure to talk to Bobby Blackwolf.

2103
02:41:30,115 --> 02:41:34,498
[SPEAKER_05]: He's always good enough to have us on his show every week, so it's always nice when we can return the favor.

2104
02:41:34,518 --> 02:41:39,261
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2105
02:41:39,301 --> 02:41:40,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to do Twitter topics, too.

2106
02:41:40,982 --> 02:41:42,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, where's my iPad?

2107
02:41:42,083 --> 02:41:42,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's my iPad?

2108
02:41:42,843 --> 02:41:46,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's in the iCade, so let me just get that out of there.

2109
02:41:47,586 --> 02:41:48,066
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

2110
02:41:48,467 --> 02:41:49,988
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't even have to lift that thing to get it out.

2111
02:41:50,568 --> 02:41:51,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I always do.

2112
02:41:51,749 --> 02:41:53,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I've... Fingers.

2113
02:41:54,991 --> 02:41:56,512
[SPEAKER_05]: You saying I should just finger it a little bit?

2114
02:41:56,833 --> 02:41:57,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you need to finger it, Rob.

2115
02:41:59,415 --> 02:42:00,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I will.

2116
02:42:00,555 --> 02:42:01,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll finger it next time.

2117
02:42:01,756 --> 02:42:05,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, before we get to last minute stories with Loki, let's try to take at least one more call here tonight.

2118
02:42:05,679 --> 02:42:06,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2119
02:42:06,620 --> 02:42:06,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2120
02:42:08,141 --> 02:42:09,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is Actdeft.

2121
02:42:09,702 --> 02:42:10,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Actdeft.

2122
02:42:10,282 --> 02:42:10,683
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

2123
02:42:12,044 --> 02:42:12,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Really fine.

2124
02:42:12,944 --> 02:42:13,284
[SPEAKER_09]: And you?

2125
02:42:14,125 --> 02:42:14,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

2126
02:42:14,485 --> 02:42:15,306
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind tonight?

2127
02:42:16,530 --> 02:42:20,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I wanted to just say that I backed up the Zelda Kickstarter.

2128
02:42:21,692 --> 02:42:22,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hey!

2129
02:42:22,532 --> 02:42:27,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm glad to hear our show is helping and that it actually does help spread the word.

2130
02:42:27,373 --> 02:42:28,774
[SPEAKER_05]: What made you decide to pitch in and help?

2131
02:42:29,654 --> 02:42:38,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I already had read Bobby's article on VOG, so I pretty much had the intention of doing so.

2132
02:42:38,456 --> 02:42:38,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Mm-hmm.

2133
02:42:39,037 --> 02:42:43,578
[SPEAKER_09]: But, well, interviewing the guy, John, I think.

2134
02:42:43,818 --> 02:42:43,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Mm-hmm.

2135
02:42:45,638 --> 02:42:48,840
[SPEAKER_09]: He pretty much has a great idea here.

2136
02:42:49,501 --> 02:42:55,626
[SPEAKER_09]: His project seems like a really, really interesting thing to do.

2137
02:42:56,167 --> 02:42:59,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially for something that many people like, like Selva.

2138
02:43:02,272 --> 02:43:13,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And something that he probably mentioned that really strikes me really good is that, for example, you're here because of video games.

2139
02:43:13,964 --> 02:43:15,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of them was Zelda.

2140
02:43:15,605 --> 02:43:19,930
[SPEAKER_09]: And you were inspired by video games to do your show.

2141
02:43:20,630 --> 02:43:25,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to mention Bobby and many other shows on VOG and other podcasts out there.

2142
02:43:25,895 --> 02:43:30,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to mention me that I do the I Love That Song articles on VOG.

2143
02:43:31,856 --> 02:43:34,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Video games and video game music inspire me to do that.

2144
02:43:34,677 --> 02:43:39,217
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I do have Zelda in part to think of that.

2145
02:43:39,277 --> 02:43:47,919
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really want to see more of the fans rather than just the history of Zelda and its creation.

2146
02:43:48,319 --> 02:43:53,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see how people were affected by this game.

2147
02:43:54,122 --> 02:44:00,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, of course, in some ways, I think this particular show, you would have to credit Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania a little more so.

2148
02:44:00,585 --> 02:44:08,910
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, the honest reality is, would I have ever played those games or been into gaming in the first place if it wasn't for the great classic 8-bit games that kind of paved the way?

2149
02:44:09,330 --> 02:44:09,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2150
02:44:09,710 --> 02:44:11,551
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly Zelda played an influence in that.

2151
02:44:12,731 --> 02:44:17,634
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, you know, it's... I liked his answer to that question a lot, too.

2152
02:44:17,654 --> 02:44:19,055
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of made me go, oh, yeah, that's true.

2153
02:44:19,115 --> 02:44:23,497
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there is a lot of inspiration for what I'm doing every Sunday night that comes from games like Zelda.

2154
02:44:23,977 --> 02:44:24,498
[SPEAKER_05]: and so forth.

2155
02:44:25,959 --> 02:44:31,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I really want to see this project finished or at least backed up.

2156
02:44:32,504 --> 02:44:46,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Though it has a long way to go, but I think that if people understand what the meaning of this project is and not necessarily think, oh, it's gonna be about Zelda and

2157
02:44:47,837 --> 02:44:49,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, they're going to prop it up.

2158
02:44:49,798 --> 02:44:51,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo.

2159
02:44:51,379 --> 02:44:53,620
[SPEAKER_09]: And do something wrong with it.

2160
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:54,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's the matter.

2161
02:44:55,041 --> 02:44:59,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the instant assumption that it's going to get shut down is a little bit silly, too.

2162
02:44:59,744 --> 02:45:03,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if it was going to get instantly shut down, I think it would have been already.

2163
02:45:03,746 --> 02:45:06,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, again, you look at something like King of Kong.

2164
02:45:06,467 --> 02:45:08,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Donkey Kong was a Nintendo game, too.

2165
02:45:08,469 --> 02:45:09,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And it happened.

2166
02:45:09,449 --> 02:45:11,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's ways he can do it.

2167
02:45:11,550 --> 02:45:13,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And he sounds like he's got his... What did he say?

2168
02:45:14,032 --> 02:45:16,253
[SPEAKER_05]: He's dotting his lowercase j's or whatever he said?

2169
02:45:16,273 --> 02:45:16,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2170
02:45:16,673 --> 02:45:20,844
[SPEAKER_05]: that he's got it explored with the legal team and so forth.

2171
02:45:21,065 --> 02:45:24,374
[SPEAKER_05]: He's ready to fight for his movie if he has to a little bit.

2172
02:45:25,239 --> 02:45:30,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't think he has any legal problems, at least because of the material.

2173
02:45:31,421 --> 02:45:42,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So it isn't like he's taking explicit, sorry, Nintendo property for profit or something like that.

2174
02:45:42,864 --> 02:45:47,145
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think he's going to be fine in that sense.

2175
02:45:48,026 --> 02:45:51,567
[SPEAKER_09]: The fans, that's what I'm worried about, but...

2176
02:45:52,643 --> 02:46:02,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, if they understand the meaning behind this project and understand what it is exactly, I think that it will get a higher response.

2177
02:46:03,389 --> 02:46:20,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, that's part of the reason why we had him on the show tonight to kind of get people talking and more people looking and, you know, maybe some, even if just a couple folks friend the thing on Facebook and then share it with their friends, that's going to be exposure to possibly, you know, thousands more people that didn't see it before, possibly, so...

2178
02:46:21,119 --> 02:46:39,672
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of it is about getting the word out so we'll see what happens but I do plan on backing it myself that and the Professor Shy Guy one I'll give him some money too I think that was pretty cool so alright yeah that project too seems pretty good to back up too alright well Actdeft any other quick thoughts before I let you go

2179
02:46:41,194 --> 02:46:42,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing more.

2180
02:46:42,755 --> 02:46:44,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I sent you a Twitter topic.

2181
02:46:44,316 --> 02:46:46,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you read it already.

2182
02:46:46,318 --> 02:46:50,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I am looking at it right now, but since you brought it up, I'll go ahead and talk about it with you here.

2183
02:46:50,380 --> 02:46:50,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2184
02:46:50,641 --> 02:46:53,803
[SPEAKER_05]: You tweeted us and it says, Skullgirls items for Team Fortress 2.

2185
02:46:54,043 --> 02:46:59,166
[SPEAKER_05]: They are up on the Steam Workshop for fans to vote and approve so they can be pre-order items.

2186
02:46:59,366 --> 02:47:00,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So what sort of items do we have to look forward to?

2187
02:47:02,408 --> 02:47:05,889
[SPEAKER_09]: They're basically hats and you know what for TF2.

2188
02:47:06,169 --> 02:47:06,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

2189
02:47:06,489 --> 02:47:07,349
[SPEAKER_09]: They look pretty cool.

2190
02:47:08,329 --> 02:47:09,350
[SPEAKER_09]: They're pretty well designed.

2191
02:47:10,030 --> 02:47:11,570
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't be too gorgeous if there weren't hats.

2192
02:47:13,831 --> 02:47:23,513
[SPEAKER_09]: These items actually were rewards for the Indiegogo they had for the DLC characters and the PC version.

2193
02:47:24,513 --> 02:47:33,919
[SPEAKER_09]: But Valve said to tell to them that they had to approve first of the items and then see if they can release them as pre-order incentives.

2194
02:47:34,639 --> 02:47:47,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Though now they have like the, not a green light, but basically that fans have to approve of the items so they can be put as incentives of pre-orders.

2195
02:47:48,667 --> 02:47:52,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And also the backers of the project of them.

2196
02:47:54,597 --> 02:47:54,917
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2197
02:47:54,998 --> 02:47:59,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, check that out on the Steam store in the community section.

2198
02:48:00,163 --> 02:48:02,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And lots of cool add-ons for games out there.

2199
02:48:02,826 --> 02:48:04,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love how Steam's been expanding that.

2200
02:48:04,708 --> 02:48:07,612
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I love me some Mass Effect Civs in Civ 5.

2201
02:48:08,733 --> 02:48:08,993
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2202
02:48:09,274 --> 02:48:12,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Actdeft, I'm going to let you go so I can get these other Twitter topics and wrap up the show.

2203
02:48:12,497 --> 02:48:13,418
[SPEAKER_05]: But have a good one, buddy, okay?

2204
02:48:13,959 --> 02:48:14,279
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

2205
02:48:14,299 --> 02:48:14,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

2206
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:15,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2207
02:48:16,001 --> 02:48:17,983
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt tweeted us about ESPN ranked the best sports video games of all time.

2208
02:48:36,917 --> 02:48:38,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Here are the top five.

2209
02:48:39,698 --> 02:48:41,319
[SPEAKER_05]: WWF No Mercy, number five.

2210
02:48:42,159 --> 02:48:44,620
[SPEAKER_05]: MVP Baseball 2005, number four.

2211
02:48:45,320 --> 02:48:47,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Tyson's Punch Out, number three.

2212
02:48:48,281 --> 02:48:50,181
[SPEAKER_05]: NHL 94, number two.

2213
02:48:50,542 --> 02:48:51,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a pretty good one.

2214
02:48:52,162 --> 02:48:54,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Tecmo Super Bowl, number one.

2215
02:48:54,823 --> 02:48:58,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly, clearly, I mean, you can't argue with that.

2216
02:48:58,264 --> 02:49:00,505
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what, I still like Super High Impact.

2217
02:49:01,885 --> 02:49:06,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, this list is badly needing... I don't see if there was maybe a 6 through 10.

2218
02:49:06,287 --> 02:49:07,268
[SPEAKER_13]: There are no Blades of Steel.

2219
02:49:07,948 --> 02:49:09,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Blades of Steel is not here.

2220
02:49:09,969 --> 02:49:13,391
[SPEAKER_05]: And NBA Jam, which I think would have been a worthy addition, is not here.

2221
02:49:13,431 --> 02:49:15,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Depending on the version of NBA Jam.

2222
02:49:15,332 --> 02:49:16,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there are some shitty versions.

2223
02:49:16,973 --> 02:49:17,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not the new one.

2224
02:49:18,113 --> 02:49:22,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you want the hardest home version ever, you want to look for the PlayStation Tournament Edition.

2225
02:49:22,936 --> 02:49:24,397
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is the original arcade version?

2226
02:49:24,437 --> 02:49:25,497
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one I would do.

2227
02:49:27,558 --> 02:49:54,953
[SPEAKER_05]: so okay very interesting but I'm okay with Tecmo Super Bowl being number one and you know even though I don't play a lot of sports video games I think it says a lot that I think I have played at least three if not four of the games on that list so I think that says a lot as to why they are the top five some other tweets here from Tigerclaw Defiance the TV show Tigerclaw tweets us saying Defiance was renewed for a second season that shocked the hell out of me because this is a sci-fi show isn't it yeah

2228
02:49:55,473 --> 02:50:08,915
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually downloaded the first four episodes to watch I haven't watched them yet because shit's been happening I think quite a few people have been watching it I hear a lot of people talking about it I did read over the Wikipedia article on it and it actually seemed really interesting

2229
02:50:10,354 --> 02:50:21,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched on Netflix three episodes of Scandal last night, which has nothing to do with sci-fi, but I bet Nellie would watch Scandal because it's by the chick who does Grey's Anatomy, which I'm almost embarrassed to say I watched it, but it's pretty good.

2230
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:24,001
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty good.

2231
02:50:24,021 --> 02:50:24,801
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty good, Loki.

2232
02:50:24,821 --> 02:50:25,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Scandal's pretty good.

2233
02:50:25,301 --> 02:50:28,403
[SPEAKER_13]: I still want to know what the thing is with Nellie and her Tyra Banks obsession.

2234
02:50:29,778 --> 02:50:30,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2235
02:50:45,675 --> 02:50:59,855
[SPEAKER_05]: one more tweet from TigerClaw and this is about a Capcom promotion for Resident Evil filling a pool with blood and gore well you know this came from the UK marketing department it was the first blood filled swimming pool

2236
02:51:01,036 --> 02:51:01,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Good lord.

2237
02:51:01,796 --> 02:51:09,058
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have 55,000 gallons of water, and I'm using the little quotey fingers, featuring... With corn syrup and red food coloring.

2238
02:51:09,118 --> 02:51:09,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.

2239
02:51:09,638 --> 02:51:17,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Fake human torsos as flotation devices, intestines as lane markers, and all kinds of gruesome objects floating in the water.

2240
02:51:18,421 --> 02:51:21,922
[SPEAKER_05]: The event is near London's Olympic Stadium, but not actually there.

2241
02:51:21,962 --> 02:51:22,442
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be weird.

2242
02:51:23,563 --> 02:51:36,894
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be that you can get the tickets for free on Monday, May 20th, but only 200 are given out each day leading up to the pools opening on May 25th and 26th weekend, Memorial Day weekend, although I guess maybe that's not a thing in the UK.

2243
02:51:37,795 --> 02:51:40,117
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're under 18, you need to have a parent.

2244
02:51:41,378 --> 02:51:43,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, that sounds whack.

2245
02:51:43,160 --> 02:51:43,620
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

2246
02:51:45,201 --> 02:51:48,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, there's nothing quite like bathing in the blood of fresh virgins.

2247
02:51:49,185 --> 02:51:50,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, now you can.

2248
02:51:51,246 --> 02:51:52,628
[SPEAKER_13]: But only if it's real blood.

2249
02:51:53,729 --> 02:51:58,092
[SPEAKER_13]: And it actually is really, really good softener for your skin.

2250
02:51:58,312 --> 02:52:00,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Just saying, a facial made out of the blood of your eyes.

2251
02:52:00,274 --> 02:52:02,516
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be concerning if it was real blood.

2252
02:52:02,596 --> 02:52:04,217
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just stupid.

2253
02:52:04,517 --> 02:52:06,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the meat market thing was stupid, too.

2254
02:52:06,699 --> 02:52:07,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2255
02:52:07,279 --> 02:52:08,240
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like, really?

2256
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:09,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is it always UK stuff?

2257
02:52:10,381 --> 02:52:10,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

2258
02:52:10,701 --> 02:52:11,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

2259
02:52:11,422 --> 02:52:12,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if they did it over here.

2260
02:52:13,123 --> 02:52:13,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, then again.

2261
02:52:13,743 --> 02:52:17,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, no disrespect to our overseas friends, but y'all are crazy.

2262
02:52:17,385 --> 02:52:21,327
[SPEAKER_13]: But then again, did you know that the Scottish diet was built on a dare, right?

2263
02:52:22,688 --> 02:52:24,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet it was Dutch influence.

2264
02:52:24,509 --> 02:52:26,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet still had something to do with this.

2265
02:52:26,450 --> 02:52:27,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm blaming the Dutch.

2266
02:52:28,131 --> 02:52:29,251
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't blame the Dutch.

2267
02:52:29,972 --> 02:52:32,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Just, I don't know, any place where, you know, blood pudding.

2268
02:52:32,433 --> 02:52:33,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm half Dutch.

2269
02:52:33,554 --> 02:52:35,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Where black pudding is served regularly.

2270
02:52:35,635 --> 02:52:35,975
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2271
02:52:36,604 --> 02:52:38,485
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Loki, any last-minute stories?

2272
02:52:38,925 --> 02:52:46,269
[SPEAKER_06]: No, unfortunately, I don't have any last-minute stories because I'm busy cramming to write an article that will be on the website tomorrow.

2273
02:52:46,529 --> 02:52:48,110
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just realized, hey, you know what?

2274
02:52:48,290 --> 02:52:49,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a very good writer.

2275
02:52:50,691 --> 02:52:51,932
[SPEAKER_06]: It's challenging.

2276
02:52:52,132 --> 02:52:53,132
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very challenging.

2277
02:52:53,192 --> 02:52:53,993
[SPEAKER_12]: I could be your editor.

2278
02:52:54,633 --> 02:52:55,754
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's all right.

2279
02:52:55,774 --> 02:52:57,274
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have time for multiple editors.

2280
02:52:57,935 --> 02:53:00,296
[SPEAKER_05]: It's write and send to somebody.

2281
02:53:00,356 --> 02:53:01,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk to you off-air.

2282
02:53:01,717 --> 02:53:02,397
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always plans.

2283
02:53:02,757 --> 02:53:03,017
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2284
02:53:03,718 --> 02:53:10,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, so if there's no last minute stories, then I guess it is time to wrap up the show, which is fine because it's about nine o'clock anyway.

2285
02:53:10,924 --> 02:53:12,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and wrap up.

2286
02:53:14,046 --> 02:53:16,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys all for listening and tuning in tonight.

2287
02:53:16,368 --> 02:53:18,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, if you like the show, please help spread the word about the show.

2288
02:53:19,891 --> 02:53:24,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us a nice five star review on iTunes or a thumbs up and support independent podcasting.

2289
02:53:24,795 --> 02:53:29,599
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a lot of indie broadcasters out there that work very hard at what they do, and we really need your support.

2290
02:53:29,659 --> 02:53:29,919
[SPEAKER_05]: You know,

2291
02:53:30,439 --> 02:53:36,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all of us can just snap our fingers and have people pouring money onto us.

2292
02:53:37,022 --> 02:53:38,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not asking for your money.

2293
02:53:38,323 --> 02:53:45,227
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't have that luxury where we can do that and just have money poured onto us to buy promotion and other things for our show.

2294
02:53:45,747 --> 02:53:47,928
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not afforded that luxury in the independent community.

2295
02:53:47,988 --> 02:53:49,669
[SPEAKER_05]: So word of mouth is so important.

2296
02:53:49,709 --> 02:53:53,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So all we ask, we're not asking for your money, we're just asking for your word of mouth.

2297
02:53:53,831 --> 02:53:54,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell a friend about the show.

2298
02:53:54,751 --> 02:53:57,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Help grow our community because community is our motivator.

2299
02:53:58,093 --> 02:53:59,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more motivation we have...

2300
02:54:00,074 --> 02:54:00,514
[SPEAKER_05]: The Better.

2301
02:54:02,555 --> 02:54:04,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.

2302
02:54:05,256 --> 02:54:06,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't I start with you, Loki?

2303
02:54:06,977 --> 02:54:07,837
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your final thought tonight?

2304
02:54:08,957 --> 02:54:18,121
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is be sure to check out our VOG Gaming Night Thursdays, 8pm Pacific Standard Time.

2305
02:54:19,982 --> 02:54:21,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's going to stay on that day, but maybe.

2306
02:54:22,123 --> 02:54:23,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the most convenient day.

2307
02:54:23,323 --> 02:54:24,504
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't conflict with anybody else.

2308
02:54:24,884 --> 02:54:28,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a little bit late on the East Coast and beyond, but

2309
02:54:28,505 --> 02:54:50,264
[SPEAKER_06]: but uh this week Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360 if you don't want to play that game on 360 be sure to go to our forums and let me know what game you do want to play and we can try to work that in because I've been asking and no one's been saying anything except for Bobby and which it's kind of shocking to see Bobby recommend Grand Theft Auto but it's going to be a lot of fun

2310
02:54:50,623 --> 02:54:52,504
[SPEAKER_05]: because he wants you to show off your elite skills.

2311
02:54:52,724 --> 02:54:53,784
[SPEAKER_05]: He's hoping to learn a thing or two.

2312
02:54:53,804 --> 02:54:55,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'll climb some skyscrapers.

2313
02:54:56,365 --> 02:54:56,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you will.

2314
02:54:58,025 --> 02:55:01,006
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I would like to play Where the Fuck is Jamie Now?

2315
02:55:01,427 --> 02:55:02,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but she's right here at my table.

2316
02:55:03,307 --> 02:55:03,747
[SPEAKER_05]: You win!

2317
02:55:04,287 --> 02:55:04,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

2318
02:55:04,768 --> 02:55:05,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, have some trail mix.

2319
02:55:06,588 --> 02:55:07,609
[SPEAKER_05]: That stuff is addicting.

2320
02:55:07,989 --> 02:55:09,129
[SPEAKER_13]: I just threw it together.

2321
02:55:09,209 --> 02:55:10,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn you, coconut.

2322
02:55:10,369 --> 02:55:11,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to lose weight, not gain it.

2323
02:55:12,450 --> 02:55:12,970
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

2324
02:55:13,230 --> 02:55:14,931
[SPEAKER_13]: The coconut is actually not very sweet.

2325
02:55:15,350 --> 02:55:16,130
[SPEAKER_05]: and SuperFatty.

2326
02:55:16,190 --> 02:55:16,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2327
02:55:16,551 --> 02:55:17,311
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good for you.

2328
02:55:17,451 --> 02:55:19,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat it.

2329
02:55:19,452 --> 02:55:20,513
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a trumpet, Jamie.

2330
02:55:20,573 --> 02:55:21,233
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a trumpet.

2331
02:55:21,773 --> 02:55:22,214
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's not.

2332
02:55:22,254 --> 02:55:23,294
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually Reese's Pieces.

2333
02:55:23,935 --> 02:55:25,775
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2334
02:55:26,796 --> 02:55:29,517
[SPEAKER_13]: My cat is insane and she doesn't know what is right.

2335
02:55:30,738 --> 02:55:31,699
[SPEAKER_13]: No, seriously.

2336
02:55:33,099 --> 02:55:36,101
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that... Is it a full moon or something?

2337
02:55:36,121 --> 02:55:38,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Midna has been completely apeshit.

2338
02:55:39,767 --> 02:55:44,771
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no idea, but I'm probably going to go home and get pounced again, so who knows what's going to happen.

2339
02:55:46,092 --> 02:55:59,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I am doing a live streaming Mass Effect 3 with my really shitty but sometimes funny commentary from 5 to 8 Pacific Time on my Twitch TV channel.

2340
02:55:59,562 --> 02:56:00,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to do some streaming.

2341
02:56:00,823 --> 02:56:01,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel left out.

2342
02:56:01,984 --> 02:56:02,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll stream tonight.

2343
02:56:03,305 --> 02:56:03,826
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

2344
02:56:04,326 --> 02:56:06,808
[SPEAKER_13]: We should do a post-Horde House multiplayer.

2345
02:56:08,042 --> 02:56:30,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I will drink that is probably a possibility we should make Shane drink and I'll drink and we'll both be dunk I don't think Shane's gonna drink for like another five years after what happened the other night which I think sadly I think the archive video's probably already gone off Twitch TV and we didn't export any of it but it was good times so alright that's it guys we're gonna close up shop and get out of here tonight

2346
02:56:30,843 --> 02:56:32,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks again for tuning in and supporting us.

2347
02:56:32,864 --> 02:56:34,765
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be back next week.

2349

[SPEAKER_05]: So we will all be here next week for another show.

2350
02:56:38,987 --> 02:56:41,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will see you then, live or in podcast form.

[SPEAKER_05]: Either way you chose to support us this week, thank you for listening.

2352

[SPEAKER_10]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2354
02:56:51,293 --> 02:56:55,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
