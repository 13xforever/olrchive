0	14000	DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, May 5th, 2013, one Wii U game finally goes free to play in the US.
19000	20000	Could more be coming?
20000	23000	Could creators of Nyan Cat Sue one video game maker?
23000	27000	And could Respawn's next game be an Xbox exclusive?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number 503 for May the 5th of 2013.
45000	48000	Happy Cinco de Mayo to you guys.
48000	53000	And on behalf of all Americans, I'd like to apologize to Mexico for Chevy's.
53000	56000	Because what is, seriously, what is Chevy's?
56000	60000	Delicious? They have like the salad that I freaking like.
60000	63000	And that corn stuff that I'm allergic to, I freaking love.
63000	65000	You bite your, you shut your whore mouth.
65000	68000	The voice of reason over there telling me to shut my whore mouth.
68000	71000	The one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
71000	73000	Rob's mouth is a dirty whore.
73000	80000	You know, people can take that a lot of different ways and I don't appreciate you slandering me on this program.
80000	83000	Your mouth is a freshly brushed whore.
83000	85000	What is that even supposed to mean?
85000	87000	It means it's clean. You brush your teeth.
87000	92000	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, who I will not call names for one minute.
92000	98000	I think Reggie has sent you a secret Cinco de Mayo message because apparently your Wii is glowing.
98000	102000	Oh, that Wii has been glowing for like two weeks.
102000	104000	No, actually, not even that. About a week.
104000	109000	And honestly, my honest reaction when that thing started glowing blue,
109000	112000	and I already know what the message is thanks to a news story coming up later,
112000	116000	but when it started glowing blue, my honest reaction was it was plugged in.
116000	119000	I swear to God, I was like the Wii was plugged in.
119000	121000	I thought I unplugged it after I moved all the,
121000	123000	well, because there's literally nothing left on my Wii.
123000	129000	I did the little Pikmin transfer thing to my Wii U because I wanted the discount on the virtual console games.
129000	133000	So there's no reason for me to have the Wii except to use, what,
133000	138000	forecast channel and spin the globe and see what the weather's like in South Pole.
138000	140000	And then in June, they're pulling the plug on that.
140000	144000	So I won't even be able to see what the weather's like in the South Pole anymore
144000	149000	unless I actually pull up an internet web browser and look at weather.com or whatever.
149000	152000	What do you have that I have in my hand right now? You have an iPhone.
152000	153000	A microphone.
153000	162000	All you have to, bite me, all you have to do is just put in, like, Antarctica on your phone and, hold on.
164000	169000	Siri, you whore, what is, nothing, what is the temperature in Antarctica?
171000	174000	I'm gonna see if Siri will answer. God, fucking Siri.
174000	177000	Yeah, yeah, how great, yeah, how fucking wonderful.
177000	178000	Oh!
178000	181000	I can't find things in Antarctica. Can you be more specific?
182000	183000	Yeah, you bitch.
183000	188000	Yeah, that awesome device you have in your hand. Yeah, technology, so great, innit?
192000	194000	The joys of live radio.
194000	195000	Yeah, no one can see me flip off, Rob.
195000	200000	Also, say hello to our live audience and the ever-present fourth guest on our program,
200000	204000	the chatters, live.vognetwork.com.
204000	208000	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
208000	211000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.
211000	214000	Once again, that's live.vognetwork.com.
214000	218000	Misty started us off tonight saying, fucking Siri indeed. See?
219000	222000	There you go, all the VOG listeners hate Siri, confirm.
222000	225000	Oh, I feel so bad for True, having your first card being 84 Mustang,
225000	227000	which is like one of the worst years for Mustangs.
227000	234000	Tiger Claw on chat says, did you see this week's SNL's weekend update
234000	237000	when they made fun of Google Glasses?
237000	240000	Yeah, what do you think about that whole Google Glasses thing?
240000	242000	I think it's too expensive.
242000	244000	Yeah, do we know the price on those yet?
244000	246000	Aren't they like three grand?
246000	247000	$1,500.
247000	251000	Yeah, it was something, I knew it was at least over $1,000, so.
251000	254000	Yeah, and I think you have to be like cordially invited to test it out, too.
254000	257000	That's like, if I had that kind of money, I'd just say, fuck it, Club 33.
257000	261000	Well, it's just because I didn't reply back to their tweets or whatever.
261000	264000	Are you supposed to say it on Google Plus? I'm not really sure how that works.
264000	265000	Yeah.
265000	268000	So they're like, I want to record everything I do.
268000	271000	Okay, we'll give you one for free.
271000	272000	Yeah.
272000	276000	VXJ6V in chat says, Rob Roberts, you skipped Loki? No, I didn't.
276000	278000	I said I would not make fun of him for a whole week.
278000	280000	Remember when I talked about the glowing light on the Wii? Where were you?
280000	285000	Well, remember, Colorado did just recently legalize a little something something.
285000	289000	I'm kidding. I know Jason's not into that. Let's see.
289000	295000	What was the other comment? Oh, SH2100Matt says, Jamie just wishes Siri was more like Edie.
295000	296000	No, I do not.
296000	298000	True. True facts. She might not be Joker.
298000	301000	I want the Seth Green voice for my phone because that would be real.
301000	306000	Actually, no, I want GLaDOS for my phone so that I can get directions while I'm being berated.
307000	310000	Can't you get like a GLaDOS GPS thing? I think I saw that somewhere.
310000	314000	You know what else they have? They have a SpongeBob one.
314000	317000	And I went to a pinball event and the guy had one.
317000	321000	And I was like, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.
321000	325000	All right. Before we get into our gaming weeks, which we always start off the show with,
325000	329000	I thought maybe we could start tonight by talking about the Ouya,
329000	335000	which is this ongoing saga of Loki's where you are one of the first few thousand people
335000	336000	that backed the Ouya, right?
336000	338000	Number 1226.
338000	341000	Which, in the scope, how many people actually pre-ordered it?
341000	344000	63,000 something. Well, 63,000 people backed it.
344000	348000	Most of them backed it with getting a console.
348000	349000	Right.
349000	351000	So, I'm sure it's a little less.
351000	353000	So, you were still one of the first few.
353000	354000	Yeah, it was the first day.
354000	359000	So, you finally got your Ouya after waiting a couple weeks and what happened?
359000	360000	It took like a month.
360000	366000	They sent me a ship. It was going to ship like back in April.
366000	369000	I don't remember. It was like the second week of April or something.
369000	371000	And it took like two weeks to get here.
371000	372000	But it's here.
372000	373000	It's here now.
373000	376000	So, you got it this week. You were putting some YouTubes up, right?
376000	379000	Yeah, I was putting up YouTubes because there's not really a whole ton of information.
379000	381000	What's your username on YouTube? LokiOLR.
381000	382000	LokiOLR.
382000	384000	Yeah, so I've got like four YouTube videos on there.
384000	387000	Okay, here's how I was shooting these videos.
387000	395000	We were still playing games over in our game room, which is basically an empty half of a building that we don't use anymore.
395000	399000	So, it's just me over there when I go to play games.
399000	406000	And then, so I used two office chairs with that box and that Xbox 360 controller and leaned my phone against it.
406000	411000	And just to give you guys some perspective, this Ouya came in like literally a shoebox.
411000	412000	Like I would expect to see shoes in there.
412000	414000	Yeah, it's a shoebox. Sort of, yeah.
414000	416000	And the Ouya itself is a tiny little thing.
416000	418000	They say it's about the size of a Rubik's Cube.
418000	422000	Dark Soccer was balancing it on her head earlier and I would say...
422000	424000	I'm going to take a picture of it in comparison to the coffee cup.
424000	427000	Yeah, it's about the size of the coffee cup. Actually, the coffee cup's bigger.
427000	428000	The coffee cup is bigger.
428000	429000	Which shows you...
429000	430000	I'm going to put my iPad behind it.
430000	435000	Which shows you the priorities of our caffeine intake here at OLR.
435000	439000	So, Dark Soccer's going to take a picture for OrangeNoseRadio.com right now.
439000	441000	Does that go to Tumblr too when you do that?
441000	442000	It can.
442000	443000	Okay.
443000	449000	So, yeah. So I got it and I did the firmware update that they had on there.
449000	451000	And started downloading games.
451000	455000	And then like one of the first few days I started trying to sideload stuff.
455000	458000	Because I wanted to see what exactly you could sideload on it.
458000	461000	It's weird because they don't really have a way to root it.
461000	465000	Although you're supposed to be able to root it straight out of the box and be able to do everything with it.
465000	468000	But it's still very early. I would still consider this like a beta test.
468000	476000	And for any outlet out there, especially Polygon or any of those guys to be reviewing this as an actual retail release.
476000	480000	It's so fucking retarded. It's mind boggling.
480000	485000	So when you actually power this thing on for the first time, what happens? What does it look like?
485000	487000	Is there a polished interface at all?
487000	491000	Yeah, there's an interface. Basically, first you have to sync your controller.
491000	495000	So it says push the button on your controller until two lights show up.
495000	497000	And you do that. It's really painless.
498000	505000	And then once you've done that, you set up your wifi if you don't have it hooked up to the ethernet.
505000	513000	So you set up your wifi and then you either create an account or you log into an existing account with Ouya.
513000	516000	If you need to have it or not.
516000	520000	So I had an account already so I logged into mine and that's it.
520000	523000	And then you're greeted. Well, I had to do a system update after that.
523000	527000	So you do a system update and then you go back to the main menu.
527000	530000	And then you have four menu options you get to choose from.
530000	532000	They have one that's basically settings.
532000	535000	They call them all different things like manage or something.
535000	539000	They have a section that's make, which is basically all the side loaded stuff.
539000	544000	Where if you're developing a game for Ouya, it's where you would dump your APKs and stuff.
544000	546000	And where you'd be able to play that stuff.
546000	550000	And then there's discover, which is their store.
550000	554000	They have that. And then play, which is going to be all your games.
554000	558000	So I went to the store and just downloaded everything.
558000	560000	As much as I could.
560000	564000	And there was some stuff that I wanted to play since I'd seen video of it.
564000	568000	One of my first downloads was No Breaks of L.A.
568000	571000	Because I was like, this looked hilarious on the video when I saw it.
571000	573000	And yeah, it's pretty hilarious.
573000	575000	Is the Final Fantasy 3 on there yet?
575000	577000	I have Final Fantasy 3, I have the demo for it.
577000	579000	I've been paying $15 for that.
579000	582000	And that's the thing too. I've downloaded everything I've downloaded so far.
582000	585000	I've not had to put any of my credit card information in yet.
585000	588000	So you don't have to put it in until you want to actually buy something.
588000	590000	I think they changed that too in one of the very first.
590000	594000	They had the whole rabble rabble on the internet about that.
594000	596000	And it changed pretty quick.
596000	598000	And you can go in and change that stuff.
598000	602000	And I think you can even remove it at any time or something.
602000	604000	So what about the hacking and all this?
604000	606000	It's supposed to be this whole open thing.
606000	608000	Did you get in there and try to figure out?
608000	611000	The first question I asked you was, did you get the emulators working?
611000	614000	Yeah, I have the emulators. I wasn't really...
614000	617000	It's emulators, so I haven't really bothered.
617000	619000	I know what Mario Kart 64 looks like.
619000	622000	I'm not in a huge hurry to put that on there yet.
622000	624000	Sometimes the emulators can be a little crappy.
624000	626000	I do want to play with it.
626000	632000	It's like they have GSNES, which I recognize that as a PC thing.
632000	636000	And they have, I think, SNES 9X on there.
637000	640000	I don't remember what the Nintendo 64 one was.
640000	644000	And they just added one for the DS, which I don't know how the hell that would work.
644000	647000	But I guess it will.
647000	649000	And what else?
649000	652000	Some other cool things I found out about it.
652000	656000	You can sync Xbox 360 controllers and PlayStation 3 controllers to it.
656000	657000	Oh nice.
657000	659000	Although I have not gotten that to work correctly.
659000	664000	I noticed though, the Ouya controller, you were letting me kind of get a feel for it.
664000	665000	It's not that bad.
665000	669000	It's not bad. The only thing that bothers me a slight little bit is just the shoulder buttons.
669000	672000	The shoulder buttons just kind of feel weird because they're big and fat.
672000	676000	And so it's a little strange to me.
676000	678000	But, you know, they work.
678000	680000	So, I don't know. It'll be alright.
680000	682000	But all the directional buttons...
682000	687000	I'm not even really a big deal about the letters being different on there.
687000	690000	They're the same colors as the Xbox 360 stuff.
690000	692000	So I just go by color anyway.
692000	694000	So I'm like, okay.
694000	696000	You pick it up in like a second and that's it.
696000	698000	It's not that jarring.
698000	700000	It's like going between the PS3 and the 360.
700000	702000	It's not that big a deal.
702000	704000	But yeah, they have like one game.
704000	710000	It supports up to like eight players with the 360 and the PS3 stuff.
710000	713000	Although, see, the PS3 controllers do work.
713000	715000	But I can't get both of them synced.
715000	717000	I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.
717000	721000	Because when I try to sync a PS3 controller to it, my Ouya controller becomes unsynced.
721000	724000	And it's supposed to be able to just add it as a second controller.
724000	726000	But I'm not doing something right.
726000	728000	I don't really know what it is.
728000	730000	That's not a big deal.
730000	732000	I mean, it's not something that's really officially supported anyway.
732000	734000	But, you know, games...
734000	736000	I've checked out some of the games on there.
736000	738000	They're pretty cool.
738000	740000	I side-loaded Grand Theft Auto 3.
740000	742000	Which is... it works.
742000	746000	I haven't played 3 on my phone.
746000	748000	So I don't know how...
748000	752000	Actually, I did play 3 on my iPod one time.
752000	754000	But then I was like, this is way too big.
754000	756000	And it doesn't work very well with the touch control, so I deleted it.
756000	761000	I asked about Final Fantasy 3 specifically because I've played the DS version of that.
761000	765000	I've emulated the NES one from way back in the day with the translation patch.
765000	770000	But more recently, I've played the iPhone, iPad version of it and the DS version.
770000	772000	So I'm kind of curious how the Ouya one compares.
772000	774000	I'm sure it's probably the same.
774000	776000	Especially if it's Android.
776000	780000	I don't remember if Square released that on Android, but I wouldn't be surprised.
780000	782000	I think they have.
782000	785000	So I checked out why I've downloaded that.
785000	787000	I haven't gotten a chance to play it.
787000	789000	I played a game called The Ball, which is alright.
789000	791000	It's kind of like a puzzle game.
791000	795000	A first-person puzzle game, similar to Portal or something like that.
795000	797000	Except without the portals.
797000	801000	I played a game called Phase, which is also a little similar to Portal.
801000	809000	You change the phase of your shield or whatever and you can go in between certain force fields.
809000	813000	And if you have it in the opposite phase, those force fields are solid.
813000	816000	So you have to play with that mechanic and stuff.
816000	823000	I played this Pingu poker game, which is something I'll probably be reviewing soon.
823000	825000	It's pretty fun.
825000	834000	It kind of reminded me of a poker RPG game that was on the iOS platforms.
834000	836000	I don't remember what that was called.
836000	841000	Puzzle poker, or Swords and Poker, that's what it was.
841000	844000	You used to love the hell out of that game on iOS.
844000	846000	This is not necessarily like that.
846000	848000	It's not an RPG or anything.
848000	851000	It's basically a combination of poker and bingo.
852000	857000	You have so many cards, and so you're making hands based on the way you'd score in bingo.
857000	861000	Clarifying comment from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
861000	862000	Game Guru says,
862000	865000	Squeenix did release Final Fantasy 3 on the Amazon store, I believe.
865000	867000	That makes sense.
867000	870000	Why not? If people are going to pay the $15 for it, go for it, right?
870000	873000	Yeah, I think they probably released it everywhere.
873000	876000	Okay, so to try and wrap up, because this is only a three-hour show.
876000	878000	You paid, what, $100?
878000	880000	What was your donor note?
880000	882000	$99 for this a year ago.
882000	883000	Here's your Ouya.
883000	884000	How do you feel?
884000	885000	Worth it?
885000	886000	It's alright.
886000	887000	Situation to tell?
887000	888000	It's alright.
888000	889000	It's a little soon to tell.
889000	893000	I mean, it's kind of like a console that plays Xbox Live Indie games.
893000	894000	That's pretty much it.
894000	897000	I mean, they're going to have some exclusive stuff eventually.
897000	898000	Which is alright.
898000	901000	I mean, in some of it, it's kind of like, woo, yeah.
901000	906000	With Microsoft clearly sunsetting that whole thing, unless we get surprised on the 21st.
906000	909000	With Microsoft clearly, that's a great vision for the console.
909000	911000	What this reminds me of.
911000	914000	It reminds me of this looks-wise.
914000	917000	And I'm not saying this to insult the machine.
917000	922000	Aesthetically, it looks like those weird kind of blingy stuff that they give you at employee fairs.
922000	927000	When they open up your medical benefits and they try to give you stuff to advertise whatever the provider is.
927000	929000	I have no idea what you're talking about.
929000	930000	I have no idea what you're talking about.
930000	933000	I thought you got little squishy stress balls from that stuff.
933000	936000	You get squishy balls and sometimes you get like...
936000	939000	Okay, if that squishy ball was in a square shape with a rounded edge, yes.
939000	942000	It looks like a cup holder that I got from one of those things.
942000	943000	Okay, I'm with you there.
943000	947000	If you were to take the top off, that looks like a thing that literally sits on my desk at work that holds my pants.
947000	950000	Some other things about the console.
950000	954000	It doesn't just do games. Of course it does other applications.
954000	955000	I mean, you can pretty much load anything you want on it.
955000	957000	It's got Twitch on there right now.
957000	960000	So you can actually view Twitch streams and stuff through that.
960000	966000	It's got... I don't know if it's Stitcher.
966000	969000	Some radio thing I don't actually listen to a lot.
969000	974000	But I recognize the app. I just don't listen to any of these radio apps except for Pandora.
974000	978000	But it's got a radio app on there. A music thing.
978000	981000	And Minecraft worked great on it.
981000	985000	Except the controls don't work because right now they have the controls locked to just the...
985000	990000	Well, the controller stuff, they have it locked to the Sony one that...
990000	992000	What was it? The...
992000	994000	What the fuck is that called?
994000	996000	The Sony... Remember their stupid...
996000	999000	Almost like the PSP phone, but it wasn't the phone.
999000	1001000	Oh, yeah.
1001000	1004000	Experience play or something.
1004000	1006000	So they have it locked to that.
1006000	1010000	And a future update is going to update it with controller support.
1010000	1011000	And I think it'll run.
1011000	1012000	But it runs smooth.
1012000	1014000	It runs smooth. You can use...
1014000	1017000	Because it has a touch pad on the actual controller.
1017000	1020000	So you can use that to click the buttons a little bit.
1020000	1024000	And there's also other apps I can get, I think, where I can map stuff to the buttons.
1024000	1026000	But I haven't bothered to try that yet.
1026000	1030000	So during the break tonight here in the studio in about an hour, we're going to plug that in real quick.
1030000	1031000	It's really easy to set up, right?
1031000	1033000	Yeah, it's just HDMI and a power cord.
1033000	1035000	So we should be able to throw that in the TV real quick.
1035000	1039000	And during the break, just take a look at it because I'm dying to see what this is.
1039000	1042000	The retail release of this is in what? June? Supposedly?
1042000	1045000	June 4th, supposedly. And they keep saying that they're not going to be late.
1045000	1046000	I think they're going to delay it.
1046000	1048000	But right now they're saying June 4th.
1048000	1050000	Isn't that like right before E3?
1050000	1052000	It's an interesting time to...
1052000	1054000	It is, but...
1054000	1056000	That's so Saturn.
1056000	1059000	Well, the thing is, it's not something that really needs a huge fanfare.
1059000	1061000	Because this is all a lot of these games.
1061000	1063000	I mean, everything's basically built by the community anyway.
1063000	1064000	So...
1064000	1065000	No, I mean...
1065000	1066000	It'll be interesting.
1066000	1070000	And there's stuff that they have, like they have MMOs that have been ported over from it and stuff.
1070000	1072000	So I can show you some of the apps on there.
1072000	1074000	And there's apps coming on there every day.
1074000	1076000	It'll be neat.
1076000	1079000	Well, you sound pretty enthusiastic about it even though you just said you're on the fan.
1079000	1081000	I'm not that excited.
1081000	1082000	Well, here's the thing.
1082000	1084000	This isn't going to be something I'm going to be playing all the time.
1084000	1086000	It'll be something I'll go back to every now and then.
1086000	1091000	Because now that I've gotten a little bit more comfortable with playing on PC with a lot of...
1091000	1093000	Because I buy a lot of Steam crap.
1093000	1095000	I buy a lot of Steam crap.
1095000	1097000	You and everybody else, Loki.
1097000	1099000	Especially when it's sale time.
1099000	1102000	I'm going in and actually starting to play a lot of that Steam crap that I bought.
1102000	1103000	So...
1103000	1104000	You know.
1104000	1105000	I don't know.
1105000	1106000	There's stuff I like on there.
1106000	1107000	And it's all...
1107000	1108000	I'll try to run.
1108000	1109000	You know, play around with it.
1109000	1111000	Good question from True in our chatroom.
1111000	1112000	Live.vognetware.com.
1112000	1114000	Does the Ouya not run hot?
1114000	1116000	No, they've got a big fan in the bottom.
1116000	1118000	There's actually like a fan vent in the bottom.
1118000	1119000	Well, yeah.
1119000	1120000	They have it weighted.
1120000	1123000	They have it weighted on purpose so that it doesn't tip over when you plug the cords in the back.
1123000	1124000	Smart.
1125000	1128000	There is a lot of kind of quirky, smart design in it.
1128000	1130000	Like, I love the controllers with the batteries inside.
1130000	1134000	The other thing about the controllers is they have aluminum face plates on them.
1134000	1135000	And they're nice and cool.
1135000	1136000	That's the other thing I like.
1136000	1140000	Because if your hands get warm, these controllers stay kind of nice and cool.
1140000	1141000	And they're comfortable.
1141000	1144000	The other thing, like I said, I'm not a huge fan of are the shoulder buttons.
1144000	1145000	But they work.
1145000	1148000	I just, you know, wish they were a little bit thinner.
1148000	1149000	That's the important part.
1149000	1150000	Alright.
1150000	1153000	Well, even though Loki has been talking about his gaming week of sorts.
1153000	1156000	We do usually start off the show with a little bit more formal.
1156000	1157000	How was your gaming week?
1157000	1160000	But I wanted to get the Ouya thing out because you've been posting to Twitter all about it this week.
1160000	1162000	And so I want to get that update right off the bat.
1162000	1164000	Let's talk about what else we've been playing this week.
1164000	1165000	Dar Sakura, we'll start with you.
1165000	1169000	Well, I'm doing a regular Mass Effect 3 stream on Thursday night.
1169000	1171000	Can we talk about streaming for a minute?
1171000	1172000	Sure.
1172000	1174000	I want to give a shout out to Bobby over at the Bobby Black Wolf Show.
1174000	1176000	Of course, before us here at VOG Network.
1176000	1181000	And my buddy DJ Tyrant on Twitter recommended a program to me that I liked way better than the one I was using.
1181000	1185000	It was called OBS, open broadcasts, and I get such a better frame rate on that.
1185000	1192000	But is it just me or like, I mean, I know this whole like streaming game thing has been kind of growing over the past couple of years.
1192000	1195000	But I really feel like in the past couple months, it's exploded.
1195000	1198000	Like everybody's doing game streams.
1198000	1204000	I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's just very interesting to me that it's become so easy and so many people are doing it.
1204000	1208000	Like, you know, you all three of us have been doing game streams at certain times.
1208000	1211000	Bobby's been doing it. And not only are you talking about just like even our listeners.
1211000	1216000	I see a lot of the Twitter, you know, things like, come see my Twitch TV. It's just, it's so easy.
1216000	1222000	It's not just gaming either because I've seen art streams.
1222000	1226000	Podcast recordings. A lot of people who don't have a set up like the network or whatever do that.
1226000	1235000	When Depeche Mode's album was about to come out, my friend Amanda, who does a lot of stuff for their official fan club, got to preview the album on a live stream.
1236000	1242000	And got to basically do a live stream preview of the new album, play all the music on it. It was really good.
1242000	1253000	But yeah, I think, I honestly think it's good because, I mean, the thing that I always like is if it's a game that I've seen, you know, 50,000 times, I like seeing people kind of rip it apart.
1253000	1260000	Sort of do the MST3K thing, which is pretty much what I do when I go stream, is yell at people in the game who can't hear me.
1261000	1266000	Tigerclaw on chat says, yeah, which is why I love it. So many games to watch people play.
1266000	1273000	And what was the comment? Oh yeah. And Tigerclaw had started that off at our chat room saying, if only you could stream the Ouya on Twitch so we can see it.
1273000	1277000	I don't have the capture card for the TV yet, but that's on the list of want to get in future.
1277000	1280000	One of my buddies sent me a link to a good one that she uses.
1280000	1281000	Oh, nice.
1281000	1286000	I'm getting one event soon. They'll do HDMI capture.
1287000	1292000	You guys missed a pretty good stream on, I think it was Friday night. Oh my gosh. We were playing Mass Effect.
1292000	1293000	And you didn't invite me?
1293000	1300000	I had problems getting started. Well, the whole thing was that Shane was going to get drunk and it took him about 20 minutes.
1300000	1303000	The stream lasted an hour. That's, I mean, he was gone. He passed out.
1303000	1304000	Wow.
1304000	1308000	But it was, it was pretty funny. So there was a few that were there. I got to see it.
1308000	1310000	So we need to do Wednesday night multiplayer.
1310000	1314000	Oh, let's see. We got to, yeah, we got to dance around all the live shows on the stream, but yeah.
1314000	1316000	So can I continue?
1316000	1319000	Yes, I'm sorry. I just want to talk about, I'm trying to promote your streaming site.
1319000	1322000	Poor Shane. Whatever.
1325000	1336000	But yeah, I've started doing that just because I don't, I get bored and usually, sometimes it's Dan's day off, but a lot of times he'll have a Wednesday where he works late.
1336000	1343000	So, you know, I'm there by myself. What's the, you know, what's the problem? I'll hop on and chat with people and yell at video games.
1345000	1354000	Then I, we got an iCade. Dan, and I saw you ordered yours. Dan ordered an iCade because Amazon has them for 44 bucks.
1354000	1358000	And we're talking about marked down by about $100.
1359000	1366000	So I went on a purchasing rampage trying to buy games that would work on it because I had none.
1366000	1375000	And it was pretty stupid of me because I spent like the last of my play cash on going to the baseball game last night too, which was really good.
1375000	1381000	But I got Pac-Man, the Atari's Greatest Hits. I already had Fix-It Felix, but I can't figure out how to get it to work.
1381000	1385000	Metal Slug 3, the Midway Arcade, Blazing Star, and the Namco Arcade.
1385000	1393000	So I bought one game on the Namco Arcade, which was Galaga. I tried playing Starblade with the iCade and Starblade doesn't work.
1393000	1401000	Like a lot of these will have like a one day demo thing that you can play through unless you buy tokens or the full version of the game.
1401000	1404000	And for most of these, the full version of the game is like a couple bucks.
1406000	1409000	Metal Slug 3 was about $5. It was worth it.
1409000	1414000	I thought of another game that supports, I think supports iCade that you might not have. It's the Activision Collection.
1414000	1419000	And I think Kaboom is free on that. I don't remember. One of the games is free that you get with that.
1419000	1421000	I've got plenty right now.
1421000	1424000	When you told me the iCades were on sale, I ordered one.
1424000	1427000	So I'm getting it Monday. I'm excited.
1427000	1435000	Because I grabbed an app in the marketplace called Gridley a couple months ago, which is just the MAME emulator in disguise.
1435000	1439000	And I know a lot of you guys are like, but emulators are bad.
1439000	1447000	But I support the real deals too. But since there aren't a lot of real deals on iOS for these things, I can't wait.
1447000	1452000	My cocktail cabinet on the bar top is just collecting dust at my work.
1452000	1457000	Let's be real guys. Are they ever going to put out Miss Nude World 96 as an app? I doubt it.
1457000	1460000	It has Miss Nude World 96 on it too.
1460000	1466000	The only way I will ever get to play Miss Nude World 96 is to turn to the dark side. Sorry, Jamie.
1467000	1474000	Okay. I'm probably going to be cancelling well.
1474000	1483000	Because unless these bastards don't ever get back to me, because I have been trying and trying and trying.
1483000	1485000	Ragnarok Online 2 went into free to play.
1485000	1488000	I saw that and I thought of you this week on Steam.
1488000	1495000	So I tried. And I had registered through whatever Gravity's new site is for it.
1495000	1497000	And so now I can't register it through Steam.
1497000	1503000	And it's in the same freaking problem that it had back with the old IRO.
1503000	1508000	Was that you can't find the installer anywhere.
1508000	1512000	And I tried to download from one of their mirrors and it kept quitting on me.
1512000	1515000	So I'm like, I could download the Steam one fine, but I couldn't run it.
1515000	1518000	And so it says, if you have problems, email, blah, blah, blah.
1518000	1520000	I'm like, not replying to me yet. So I don't know what to do.
1520000	1523000	So I'm really supremely pissed.
1523000	1527000	And I still need to update my PSO2.
1527000	1532000	God, I played something else. I don't remember.
1532000	1533000	Alright.
1533000	1534000	Seriously.
1534000	1535000	Then we'll go over to Loki.
1535000	1536000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1536000	1538000	I played a few things.
1538000	1542000	I finally installed, granted that a...
1542000	1545000	I tried installing Andreas on there.
1546000	1551000	And I got it to work, but mapping the buttons to the Xbox 360 controller are...
1551000	1554000	It's pretty much impossible to get it to work correctly.
1554000	1556000	So I kind of gave up on that.
1556000	1561000	I'm still trying to get my copy back from my sister, but she put it in storage.
1561000	1563000	So I have to get it.
1563000	1566000	What was she thinking putting your game in storage?
1566000	1568000	I basically gave her the PlayStation 2.
1568000	1570000	I guess siblings can get away with that a little more.
1570000	1573000	That's fine. I'm not a huge fan of Andreas. I've already played it.
1574000	1578000	I wanted to play it on PC because I have it on PC, but I can't map the buttons correctly.
1578000	1582000	They have a program to do it, but it doesn't work right and you have to un-patch the game.
1582000	1585000	It's just a pain in the ass, so I'm just not worrying about that.
1585000	1588000	I got four episodes from Liberty City on there.
1588000	1589000	I played it for a little bit and I'm like,
1589000	1592000	Cool, I'm going to play episodes from Liberty City and I'm going to play Deathmatch.
1592000	1594000	And I'm going to totally dominate Deathmatch.
1594000	1597000	And there's no one on fucking line anymore.
1597000	1602000	There's nobody, nobody at all playing any sort of ranked Deathmatch or Deathmatch or anything.
1602000	1604000	It's all fucking free mode.
1604000	1609000	Free mode's fun, but I want to play a competitive game in Grand Theft Auto.
1609000	1612000	And I can't do that anymore because no one plays it.
1612000	1615000	Which is why I need Grand Theft Auto 5.
1615000	1621000	And it's such a fucking cock tease to have three fucking trailers and extended previews all over the god damn internet.
1622000	1624000	I need this game. It's my crack.
1624000	1626000	I need it. I'm feended for this game.
1628000	1630000	So yeah, Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to be awesome.
1630000	1631000	I can't wait to play it.
1632000	1636000	I guess I don't even need to ask about those trailers that came out this week and how you felt.
1636000	1637000	Oh, they're fantastic.
1637000	1638000	I think you made it pretty clear.
1638000	1639000	It's fantastic.
1639000	1643000	Well, even there was like a 90 minute kind of talking about it.
1643000	1648000	Because basically everyone was shown about 30 minutes of gameplay.
1649000	1655000	That talked everything about from the mechanic between switching between each protagonist in the game.
1656000	1657000	And how they're...
1657000	1660000	You know, the map is about five times the size of Red Dead Redemption.
1660000	1666000	One and a half times of Red Dead Redemption's worth in the ocean.
1666000	1668000	Under the ocean, actually.
1668000	1670000	So there's a lot of scuba diving in the game.
1670000	1671000	You can pretty much do whatever...
1671000	1675000	I mean, you can do whatever you want in the game, but it's just so much to explore.
1675000	1676000	It's just gonna...
1676000	1677000	It's gonna be awesome.
1678000	1681000	And just a lot of mechanics in the game sound really good.
1681000	1685000	Like the heists and how you have to do missions to kind of do recon on different things.
1685000	1689000	And set up the actual heists and you hire your people to help you out.
1691000	1693000	It just looks like a very good game.
1693000	1695000	And a very good storyline going along with that.
1696000	1697000	Actual games I played.
1697000	1698000	Saints Row the Third.
1698000	1703000	I'm still trying to go through and finish off my achievements that don't involve co-op.
1703000	1707000	But I'm just getting so bored with a lot of these games that...
1707000	1709000	Like, I don't know what I want to play anymore.
1709000	1713000	Because I can't think of anything that I want to play that sounds exciting.
1713000	1714000	You know, like Grand Theft Auto V.
1714000	1719000	I can't think of anything other than Saints Row IV and Grand Theft Auto V and maybe Earth Defense Force 2025.
1719000	1721000	But none of those are coming out yet.
1721000	1727000	And so I'm kind of in this weird position where, yeah, I'm just kind of going on autopilot and playing stuff.
1728000	1731000	I don't really want to play, but I'm kind of playing it anyways.
1731000	1738000	One thing I did notice on Saints Row the Third, though, is their AI pathing doesn't account for the fact that there's...
1738000	1743000	A section in the game, or actually a very large section in the game, where they raise the bridges in the game.
1743000	1749000	So that, you know, because it's a security thing and they're trying to, like, trap the Saints on the island and stuff.
1749000	1753000	And the cars don't realize that the bridge is up.
1753000	1762000	So they keep trying to go up the bridge and they just crash and crash and crash and then explode and crash again.
1762000	1766000	And it was hilarious. It's like standing there watching the cars just try to go straight.
1766000	1768000	That sounds like some Driver 3 shit right there.
1768000	1776000	That almost inspired me to even bring my singing voice and do, like, a Buggy Saints Row the Third, you know.
1776000	1779000	That is begging for the Benny Hill theme.
1779000	1783000	It's just seriously like, what? This is so terrible.
1783000	1787000	There's even a mission I had to do where I had to stop this. Basically, it's an assassination mission.
1787000	1791000	You have to kill this guy before he kills him. He's going to commit suicide by jumping off the bridge.
1791000	1796000	And so she needs to collect the money, you know, insurance money, but, you know, it's null and void if he commits suicide.
1796000	1801000	But the bridges are up, so he spawns in the water. He's not dead.
1801000	1805000	I mean, he wouldn't even die from that drop because it's not that big of a drop. It's just like a small bridge.
1805000	1812000	And so I just had to make my way around to shoot him from the side of the, you know, the shore.
1812000	1815000	But it was just so stupid and buggy. It just all messed up.
1815000	1822000	Or, like, I was supposed to do this other assassination mission where I was supposed to dress up like one of the gangs, the Deckers.
1822000	1828000	And so I go to my hideout because I don't even, I can't seem to find the clothing option to put it on and all.
1828000	1831000	And so I'm sorting through my wardrobe and stuff and all of a sudden I start getting shot.
1831000	1842000	I'm like, what the hell is going on? And I look and the guy that I'm supposed to be assassinating somehow came into my safe house and just starts shooting at me.
1842000	1848000	I'm like, how the fuck did this guy even get here in the first place? He's not even supposed to be coming after me yet because I don't have the right outfit on.
1848000	1850000	I haven't even found this guy. It's just ridiculous.
1850000	1856000	You know, I know people have their opinions on you and your strong opinions about Nintendo and other things.
1856000	1862000	But, you know, it's amazing to me how when you really like a game, you will make that game last forever.
1862000	1865000	I've bought it, like, on two platforms already.
1865000	1866000	Oh, that's great.
1866000	1874000	So I've, I don't know. So anyways, and then beyond that, Ouya played lots of games on the Ouya and we talked about a lot of those already.
1874000	1879000	And what else did I play this week? More Call of Duty.
1879000	1884000	I actually am playing through a little bit more of the story campaign on three, which is it's all right.
1884000	1888000	It's just it's Call of Duty. They don't have a great, they don't have a great story.
1888000	1892000	I mean, it's cinematic. It's kind of fun. You don't play Call of Duty for the story.
1892000	1897000	No, you don't really. You don't really play for the story. You play for the act. It's just watching, like, an action movie. I mean, come on.
1897000	1904000	And Minecraft X-Ray LA, because we did a VOG gaming night, actually had so much show this time. Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.
1904000	1905000	That's all right. It's all good.
1905000	1908000	I really wanted to go, but I had to work on one of my other projects that night.
1908000	1909000	It's all good.
1909000	1910000	But you're doing Forza this week, right?
1910000	1911000	This week we're doing Forza Horizons.
1911000	1912000	I will be there.
1912000	1913000	I'll bring out more people, so.
1913000	1914000	I'll be there.
1914000	1918000	Forza Horizon this Thursday, 8 p.m. Pacific time. Probably goes for about two hours.
1918000	1920000	So at least that's how long I can play.
1921000	1922000	I might not be there right at 8, but I'll be there.
1922000	1923000	That's all right.
1923000	1924000	All right. Yeah.
1924000	1927000	Okay, before we get to my gaming week, Dark Soccer, you wanted to add one.
1927000	1928000	I did forget one more. Tomb Raider.
1929000	1930000	The new one.
1930000	1934000	Yeah, which I have now officially stolen Alan's name for it. It's Girl.
1934000	1936000	Or what is it, Lara Croft?
1936000	1938000	Lara Croft's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.
1939000	1940000	And how was it?
1940000	1942000	BCPC sale on Steam this weekend, right?
1942000	1949000	Yeah, it's half price, so since I had a lovely gift from Loki, thank you, of $20 in my Steam wallet.
1949000	1951000	And no pressure at all from Tim, who was here last week.
1951000	1955000	Well, I intended on getting it eventually anyway, but I only paid $8 for it, so.
1955000	1956000	Nice. All right.
1957000	1958000	Good times with it?
1959000	1960000	That poor girl.
1960000	1962000	The opening sequence, you're like, damn.
1963000	1966000	Like, how could your day get worse? Oh, let's fall off a plane.
1967000	1968000	You could get impaled by a tree.
1969000	1971000	I probably died five times at the beginning of the game.
1971000	1976000	Yeah, but it's not the end of the world. Like, the death isn't super frustrating in that game.
1976000	1979000	And it starts you pretty much right from the section you left off on.
1979000	1980000	Right.
1980000	1982000	But I need to find the picture on my Tumblr and post it in chat for everybody.
1983000	1984000	Sounds good. Live.vognetwork.com.
1985000	1988000	My Gaming Week, I'll try to be kind of quick here, because I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
1988000	1991000	In fact, I spent a lot of time playing some old stuff.
1991000	1993000	Virtual Console on Wii U, go figure.
1993000	1998000	I actually bought a lot of stuff on it, I'm kind of embarrassed to say.
1998000	2003000	But Mega Man, the old school Mega Man came out this week, and how could I not?
2003000	2007000	Like, the Mega Man games have some of the best soundtracks.
2007000	2011000	Yeah, so I had to check it out on Virtual Console, and I'm loving the whole
2011000	2015000	restore points are a godsend in stages like Ice Man's stage.
2015000	2020000	That stage can go to hell for those blocks that appear or disappear.
2020000	2024000	But yeah, I've been having a good time with that.
2024000	2029000	Otherwise, there's another game, but Darkstalker is going to bring it up later in the show.
2029000	2032000	So I'll wait to get my comments on that until later.
2033000	2037000	Oh, I was on Steam randomly last night, and I was looking at the free-to-play games,
2037000	2043000	and I was going to do Ragnarok Online 2, but I decided instead to play Puzzle Pirates.
2043000	2044000	Remember Puzzle Pirates?
2044000	2045000	I saw that the other day.
2045000	2047000	I'm like, that's on Steam?
2047000	2048000	Yeah, I know, right?
2048000	2049000	That was sweet.
2049000	2050000	I was like, God, that took me back.
2050000	2052000	That was like, we all played that.
2052000	2055000	That's what we used to play when we were all playing DDR regularly.
2055000	2057000	Like, a ton of us were playing Puzzle Pirates.
2057000	2058000	I remember I reamed on a song.
2058000	2059000	I didn't play it at the time.
2059000	2062000	But I think actually during those days, I was playing Ragnarok Online.
2062000	2066000	And the building is still the same freaking thing with the match.
2066000	2067000	But they've added a lot to it.
2067000	2069000	Like, you have rooms that you customize.
2069000	2073000	It's definitely a game that they put out there for more lower-end PCs.
2073000	2076000	You could probably play Puzzle Pirates just fine on a netbook.
2076000	2077000	It's that kind of game.
2077000	2081000	So yeah, that was kind of fun to just kind of get back into that again.
2081000	2085000	Otherwise, World of Warcraft, Mass Effect 3, a lot of the usual suspects.
2086000	2089000	And another game that I'm going to be reviewing on VoG soon.
2089000	2090000	So stay tuned for that.
2091000	2092000	Okay.
2093000	2094000	Let's get into some gaming news.
2094000	2097000	Quick, plugs for the Twitters, the Facebooks and all that.
2097000	2100000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R is where you can follow us on Twitter.
2100000	2102000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2102000	2105000	And I don't really have a whole lot else to add.
2105000	2107000	We may not be here Memorial Day weekend.
2107000	2108000	I may be gone.
2108000	2111000	But we'll let you know in the next couple weeks.
2111000	2114000	So stay tuned for all that live programming information.
2114000	2115000	All right.
2115000	2116000	Let's talk about the gaming news.
2116000	2117000	Loki, start us off tonight.
2117000	2118000	Okay.
2118000	2120000	So apparently the Wii U has now been hacked.
2120000	2125000	Or at least the mod chip creators behind the Wii key.
2125000	2130000	They have now said that they have claimed to, I guess, compromise Wii U security.
2131000	2134000	And completely reverse the Wii U drive authentication,
2134000	2137000	disk encryption, file system and everything else.
2139000	2141000	And yeah.
2141000	2143000	And I guess what's supposed to come of this
2143000	2147000	is that they're going to either create a replacement optical drive
2147000	2149000	that will go into your Wii U.
2149000	2150000	Or they're going to create some sort of...
2150000	2153000	Like I've seen this before with some of the Xbox 360 drives
2153000	2157000	where they'll have a daughter board or something like that
2157000	2159000	that replaces a board on there
2159000	2161000	and you can just kind of hook in the ribbon cables
2161000	2163000	and it's a bypass or something.
2163000	2164000	So they'll have something like that.
2164000	2165000	And the Wii key...
2165000	2167000	Actually the Wii key, I want to say...
2167000	2169000	No, that's not the mod chip I have in my Wii.
2169000	2174000	I actually have a Cyclo Wii.
2174000	2175000	It was that one.
2175000	2177000	But the Wii keys were pretty similar.
2177000	2179000	It was just kind of like a...
2179000	2180000	They had a few quick solder points
2180000	2185000	and they just soldered straight onto the board on the disk drive.
2187000	2189000	And to kind of show, I guess, how serious that this is,
2189000	2191000	they've also dumped their first game,
2191000	2193000	Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth.
2193000	2195000	One of the probably most terrible games out there.
2195000	2198000	But they have dumped it and...
2198000	2200000	Well, somebody's dumped it
2200000	2204000	and it's been released out there on the internet
2204000	2206000	to download and do nothing with
2206000	2209000	because there's no such mod chip to play it on yet.
2209000	2213000	But yeah, Nintendo is aware of it.
2213000	2216000	They say that they're going to find a way to bypass everything.
2216000	2219000	But thus begins the back and forth struggle
2219000	2222000	that is hacking and patching,
2222000	2225000	more hacking and more patching, so on and so forth.
2225000	2227000	And so far, there's really no homebrew version
2227000	2229000	or homebrew needs of this.
2229000	2232000	I guess maybe you can make your own software for the Wii U,
2232000	2234000	but this is mainly piracy.
2234000	2236000	Hackers going to hack.
2236000	2238000	Or backups, I guess, if you will.
2238000	2240000	Yeah, sure.
2240000	2243000	Okay, so I think the real question to ask here, though,
2243000	2245000	is how hard is this to pull off?
2245000	2248000	Because the harder it is, the less impact this is going to have.
2248000	2251000	We know that the pirates and the people
2251000	2253000	that are all about wanting to steal games,
2253000	2255000	or make backups, as fast as they can,
2255000	2257000	they're always going to find a way in.
2257000	2259000	But the question is, how easy is it
2259000	2261000	for somebody else to do that?
2261000	2263000	This is going to be like a mod chip.
2263000	2265000	So you're going to have to buy a mod chip.
2265000	2267000	You're going to have to install the mod chip onto your system
2267000	2270000	or install some sort of part on your system.
2270000	2273000	This isn't like the Wii homebrew channel
2273000	2276000	where it was a hack that modified your dashboard
2276000	2278000	to run a program that you could then
2278000	2280000	run games off a hard drive.
2280000	2282000	It's not that simple. You have to buy a mod chip.
2282000	2284000	Can Nintendo brick your console
2284000	2286000	with a firmware update if you were running this?
2286000	2288000	They may threaten to do that.
2288000	2290000	I don't know if they can.
2290000	2294000	There's drive emulators and stuff like that
2294000	2296000	that are already out there.
2296000	2298000	Why don't they do it?
2298000	2301000	My point is, why would Nintendo play softball with this?
2301000	2303000	If they want to be like,
2303000	2305000	don't fuck with us.
2305000	2307000	Because of false positives is what it is.
2307000	2309000	Because if you have someone that legitimately
2309000	2311000	hasn't done anything and fucked their console up,
2311000	2314000	they're already in not a very strong position
2314000	2317000	with their console and to piss people off like that.
2317000	2320000	Also, they're probably going to let this thing get released,
2320000	2322000	get people to buy the console because they're like,
2322000	2324000	oh, I'm going to hack all this stuff up and then patch it.
2324000	2326000	Okay.
2326000	2328000	That's smart.
2328000	2330000	That's what I would think they would do.
2330000	2333000	How many people went and got a PSP
2333000	2336000	the day they heard that NES emulators are runnable on it?
2336000	2338000	On top of that though,
2338000	2340000	they're probably going to be prompted
2340000	2343000	if this does come out pretty widespread,
2343000	2346000	they're going to be prompted by their third party developers
2346000	2348000	that hey, we need you to fix this
2348000	2351000	because we're not making a lot off of these Wii games already
2351000	2354000	and if we're making even less now because people are pirating them,
2354000	2356000	it's going to be a tough thing.
2356000	2360000	And also, here's the other thing you've got to consider too,
2360000	2364000	these aren't necessarily DVDs that they're running on anymore
2364000	2366000	so you're going to have to have a Blu-ray burner
2366000	2369000	and Blu-ray media to do that.
2369000	2371000	I think that stuff's come down.
2371000	2372000	That stuff's coming way down.
2372000	2376000	We're only a couple of years away from that being standard really for PCs.
2376000	2380000	But if anything, I could see them go on the route of the X key or something
2380000	2387000	where it's basically a drive in the middle board
2387000	2389000	that allows you to run.
2389000	2392000	It'll emulate the drive and you'll run stuff off a hard drive
2392000	2394000	and it's going to be easy like that.
2394000	2396000	The way I see it, they're going to do it.
2396000	2398000	But right now, it's progress I guess.
2398000	2402000	But if they've completely reversed the file system and stuff,
2402000	2405000	who's to say that they can't come up with their own modified dashboard
2405000	2406000	that will run on there
2406000	2409000	because if they've figured out how to do the file system stuff
2409000	2410000	and then the keys for that.
2410000	2414000	The hacking community is going to have an interesting case to make too.
2414000	2420000	I understand why they wanted to do Homebrew Channel on Wii
2420000	2423000	because there wasn't a lot of indie friendly stuff on the Wii.
2423000	2426000	But Wii U is really trying to make a case.
2426000	2428000	We are the indie friendly platform.
2428000	2430000	You've even heard the indie developers come out and say,
2430000	2433000	I know this is going to shock people,
2433000	2435000	but Nintendo is the platform to be on right now if you're indie.
2435000	2439000	So does the hacking community have as much of a case
2439000	2444000	when it seems like Nintendo is really embracing a lot of the Homebrew stuff open arms?
2444000	2447000	Well, I shouldn't say Homebrew, but indie stuff open arms,
2447000	2458000	thus negating the need for a Homebrew channel that is totally clean without piracy.
2458000	2460000	I don't think that they're really going to...
2460000	2463000	It's just one hacking group doing something and that's it.
2463000	2465000	So you're going to have people that want to...
2465000	2467000	They're in the business of selling mod chips,
2467000	2469000	so they're going to want to make a mod chip to sell.
2469000	2471000	And we use just the console at the moment.
2471000	2473000	As soon as PlayStation 4 is out, they'll be working on that too.
2473000	2475000	Of course, yeah.
2475000	2479000	All right, well, Loki alluded to this a minute ago,
2479000	2481000	and I was mentioning this earlier in the show
2481000	2483000	when they were teasing me about the Wii message light being on,
2483000	2487000	but Nintendo actually sent a message to all the Wii owners this week saying,
2487000	2490000	hey, have you checked out the Wii U?
2490000	2493000	So it seems odd to me that it took them this long to do it,
2493000	2495000	but they did send a message to everybody that says,
2495000	2500000	quote, did you know that you can play nearly all of your existing Wii games on Wii U?
2500000	2504000	I thought you could play every Wii game on Wii U.
2504000	2506000	Why did they say nearly all?
2506000	2509000	I think they're counting maybe virtual console and stuff.
2509000	2512000	Is there some stuff that you can't quite port over?
2512000	2515000	Maybe it's something to save their ass if something doesn't work.
2515000	2517000	Yeah, it's possible.
2517000	2519000	Maybe, yeah, that's true.
2519000	2522000	Your Wii controllers and many Wii accessories can also be used with the new Wii U console,
2522000	2524000	along with any downloaded games, save data,
2524000	2527000	and other info stored in your existing Wii console.
2527000	2529000	Wii U is the all-new home console from Nintendo.
2529000	2531000	It's not just an upgrade.
2531000	2537000	It's an entirely new system that will change the way you and your family experience games and entertainment.
2537000	2540000	Do you hear that, Jimmy Fallon? It's not just an upgrade.
2540000	2542000	That's a big problem, though.
2542000	2543000	I mean, think about it.
2543000	2550000	If they have to go out there and tell people, hey, guys, it's not just a peripheral, it's an upgrade,
2550000	2553000	they've done a poor job marketing it then.
2553000	2559000	Well, that and maybe this is a case now where the name issue is finally biting Nintendo.
2559000	2563000	A lot of people razz them for the Wii name, and that ended up working.
2563000	2565000	It didn't matter. Nintendo did great with that.
2565000	2569000	But this whole Wii U name, I think maybe Nintendo's wondering,
2569000	2573000	I don't know if they are, but I think a lot of people are going, maybe that really wasn't the best name.
2573000	2575000	They should have started off calling it the U.
2575000	2580000	Or, well, Super Wii, which is, isn't that what they call it in Japan?
2580000	2582000	Something that translates to Super Wii?
2582000	2584000	Something like that?
2585000	2588000	Yeah, Koopa Kid Jeremy in our chat right there says,
2588000	2591000	this just proves they should have called it something else.
2591000	2594000	Mm-hmm. Agree.
2594000	2598000	Anyhow, what I think is interesting about this also,
2598000	2604000	Iwata, Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata, said in a financial results briefing last week that,
2604000	2610000	quote, we have not been able to solidly communicate the product value of Wii U to our consumers yet,
2610000	2612000	which has been a grand challenge for us.
2612000	2615000	We have the misunderstanding that Wii U is just Wii with a pad for games,
2615000	2620000	and others even consider Wii U GamePad as a peripheral device connectable to Wii.
2620000	2625000	Wii feel deeply responsible for not having tried hard enough to have consumers understand the product.
2625000	2628000	Have they done the commercial onslaught that they did with Wii?
2628000	2631000	Like, I remember all those commercials, Wii would like to play, and that whole thing.
2631000	2634000	That was a pretty good marketing plan. Now they have, like,
2634000	2635000	Did they do that at all?
2635000	2639000	They have a new marketing campaign going on right now that's really dumb.
2639000	2644000	It's basically these families coming in, and they're, like, bussing them in by, or,
2644000	2647000	vanning them in, whatever, taking them by a van,
2647000	2652000	and bringing them to Nintendo headquarters to try the Wii U out for the first time,
2652000	2658000	and they're like, Oh my God! Nintendo stuff is so awesome! This is the best thing ever!
2658000	2663000	Oh, this GamePad is so amazing! This is gonna change it all!
2663000	2666000	And it's just, like, seriously, just one issue.
2666000	2670000	If Nintendo really wants to get their message across about the Wii U, here's what they need to do.
2670000	2674000	They're gonna need to release a Mario soccer game this Christmas,
2674000	2680000	and they need to take it out across America to all the little peewee soccer championships,
2680000	2685000	so all their target audience, the moms and dads of the soccer kids, can play Mario soccer,
2685000	2688000	and then they can all gossip amongst themselves and get the word out.
2688000	2692000	Like, that's how Nintendo reaches their core audience, right? Soccer games.
2692000	2693000	Eh?
2693000	2695000	Bowling!
2695000	2697000	They are at malls.
2697000	2702000	The problem is you have people that were really excited about the Wii, you know, like myself,
2702000	2705000	and bought it because it was a very innovative product at the time.
2705000	2709000	Granted, we wish it was kind of like, you know, graphics of the Xbox 360 and PS3.
2709000	2711000	I was in it for the donuts.
2711000	2717000	And so you bought it, and then you're like, Hmm. I'm not playing anything on it.
2717000	2721000	I bought these Mario games. Now I'm not really playing anything on it.
2721000	2726000	And then the new system comes out, and you're like, Well, okay. It's got this cool game pad on it.
2726000	2730000	Okay, but hold on, though, because there would be that one or two games a year that are like,
2730000	2734000	you know, Metroid Prime 3, Mario Galaxy, Zelda Skyward Sword.
2734000	2738000	You know, there are those big, big games that are like, Okay, I gotta play some.
2738000	2739000	First party games?
2739000	2741000	Yes.
2741000	2743000	A game's a game in this case, yes.
2743000	2748000	Yeah, it's fantastic, and then when, you know, the developers are so behind, you know, the Wii and stuff,
2748000	2753000	in fact, they thought it was so great that they decided, Hey, EA said, Hey, you know what?
2753000	2756000	We're gonna put out FIFA on this system every year.
2756000	2761000	Oh, it's not gonna be a different FIFA, but it'll be the same FIFA every year.
2761000	2763000	Because, you know, we don't want to put any money into it.
2763000	2766000	That's different. That's different. You can't blame Nintendo for what EA did.
2766000	2770000	Okay. Konami decided, Hey, you know what? We're gonna do Pro-E.
2770000	2771000	You can't blame them for that either.
2771000	2773000	What is it with soccer games? I mean, seriously.
2773000	2782000	That would be like me blaming Microsoft for all those terrible rehashes in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade.
2782000	2783000	That wasn't Microsoft's fault.
2783000	2785000	Can't blame them for all the shovelware on the Wii?
2785000	2786000	No, no.
2786000	2795000	I just think there wasn't, the Wii U, the step from the Wii, or like, you know, previous generation, the GameCube to the Wii,
2795000	2799000	there was a big jump as far as gameplay, innovation, stuff like that.
2799000	2806000	When you have the Wii U, where the only thing really different with it is, it has a gamepad now that you can use with a touchscreen,
2806000	2808000	and it's HD.
2808000	2812000	But it plays all the, you know, it does everything else that the Wii does.
2812000	2815000	It wasn't that kind of a wow factor to it.
2815000	2820000	I mean, you had like something good and then, everyone's not gonna be clamoring to get it because they're like,
2820000	2825000	Well, I can play Wii Bowling on this, right? Okay.
2825000	2829000	Well, why do I need to buy a new system to play the same game I'm already playing?
2829000	2835000	Or, you know, hey, cool that they're gonna have a new Mario game, but it kinda looks like the other Mario game that I bought a couple years ago.
2835000	2840000	So, the short version of what you just said I'm hearing is, Nintendo Land was not Wii Sports.
2840000	2844000	Nintendo Land wasn't Wii Sports, and I don't think it was, it was a system seller.
2844000	2849000	A big, big chunk of people, I feel like we, this is a very deja vu conversation, so we need to move on here a minute.
2849000	2851000	It was like Wii Sports, Nintendo version or something.
2851000	2854000	How many people that bought the Wii were not buying the Wii?
2854000	2858000	They were not buying the Wii, they were buying Wii Sports and the console that came with it.
2858000	2861000	That was a big chunk of people that bought the Wii.
2861000	2869000	Yeah, because it was kinda cool, because for the first time, you're gonna be able to like play tennis by like actually standing up in the room and swinging your arms.
2869000	2878000	And that was a big experience for people. It was like, whoa, you know, for once, I can actually play a game, I don't need to figure out the controls, I just play like I would kinda play tennis.
2879000	2883000	And, you know, I would bowl like I would bowl. You know, it was very natural for people.
2883000	2888000	But then, going to Nintendo Land, it's like, well, it's not that different.
2888000	2895000	Well, this is kinda similar to what I've already done on the Wii, but why do I need to spend the extra money to play this game that's very similar to what I already have?
2895000	2899000	That was the problem, it wasn't just, it wasn't a big hook that got people in.
2899000	2903000	That gamepad was not enough hook to get people onto the system.
2903000	2909000	Maybe if they'd put out a game, like, you know, the thing about Wii Sports is that everybody generally knows those sports. Everybody knows bowling.
2909000	2918000	Specifically within Wii Sports, that bowling mini-game, maybe the tennis to an extent too, but those two games specifically were just huge.
2918000	2928000	And maybe Nintendo Wii U needed something, it needed that for, or still needs, it could still come out this Christmas, needs something like that that everybody just knows.
2929000	2936000	You know bowling, you know, but you don't necessarily know Donkey Kong Crash Course or F-Zero, you don't necessarily know that stuff.
2936000	2946000	I don't know why, but my mind goes to like maybe a board game or a card game thing, especially if you could like play it online or something, but that would require Nintendo to understand online.
2946000	2953000	The problem is, for the Wii U, I think what they would have needed to have done is like done something completely different than the Wii.
2953000	2957000	Like, I don't know, come up with, I can't really think of what they would have to do.
2957000	2965000	Here you go, Tiger Claw says, too bad Wii Sports didn't have online multiplayer, sucks playing by yourself against the computer. Kabam, Wii Sports 2, online.
2965000	2971000	But the thing with the Wii, what they're pushing though, is that it's a family party atmosphere is what it is.
2971000	2978000	But that's not the dynamic anymore. That used to be the dynamic when it was like, you know, offline games that had four controller ports.
2978000	2983000	Like the GameCube was, you know, you got people in the room and you're playing together on TV split screen.
2983000	2987000	That's not how it is anymore. It's over the internet playing multiplayer because people don't live near each other.
2987000	2996000	You now have friends. Instead of having friends in your neighborhood and maybe a pen pal or something in another state, you have friends all over the world because everyone's so connected now.
2996000	3001000	That's true. I probably do more gaming with Shane in Kansas than anybody else.
3001000	3010000	Exactly. Like distance isn't a thing anymore, really. I mean, you talk to people, you probably talk to people more that are like further away than you do like your neighbors and stuff.
3010000	3018000	So it's not the thing. And that's the thing. Like I don't, like the Wii, you know, it was kind of fun playing the Wii stuff, but it was all party game stuff.
3018000	3024000	And I can't see myself getting the Wii U because, hey, now five people could play. Cool. I don't have five people in my house ever.
3024000	3033000	Okay. YYR with a valid counter statement in our chat room at live.vognetware.com. The audience for Wii Sports probably didn't care that much about online play.
3033000	3040000	True. But hear me out here a minute, YYR, because you have that camera on every Wii U console.
3040000	3048000	What if grandma could play bowling with her grandkids thanks to the internet technology in that case, like every Wii U could have...
3048000	3049000	It would be awesome.
3049000	3056000	That would be amazing. But Nintendo, like Nintendo's sitting on that gold mine and they, that's not what they want to do for some reason.
3056000	3060000	Because that's all they were showing is like, hey, but you could do FaceTime back and forth and talk to grandma.
3060000	3069000	Make grandma understand why she wants to play online. Maybe if grandma understood why that would be a great thing, that's not such an issue anymore.
3069000	3071000	But I respect your point, YYR. I get what you're saying.
3072000	3073000	I understand.
3073000	3079000	Yeah, I totally do too. I just think Nintendo could invent a reason why you want to be online. Anyhow.
3079000	3091000	Part of me also thinks though that I've had this view of Nintendo as sort of the traditionalist and how social should be.
3091000	3099000	And the fact that they actually want to get people together in the same room doing in-person gaming.
3099000	3108000	I mean, it almost seems to me that they've got an agenda to encourage that. And I don't know. I don't see them changing off of that anytime really soon.
3108000	3113000	I got to go back to like real quick, you know, because that does make sense that that may be their agenda.
3113000	3122000	But then you got to go to the movie Joe Dirt where there's the guy with, you know, the fireworks stand and all he has is sparklers and those little snakes.
3122000	3130000	And he's like, but that's what I like. But you can't just think about what you like or what your focus may be. You have to think about other people out there.
3130000	3135000	I understand that may be the focus that you want people to gain in the room, but you know what would be awesome too?
3135000	3142000	Is say you want to have that gaming experience, but you can't get your friends over. You know, say that, you know, they're gone somewhere and you want to play with them anyways.
3142000	3144000	Think about all the options.
3144000	3152000	Koopa kid Jeremy in our chat room says, keep grandma off the internet. Old people opening 90 tabs, all of them yahoo.com.
3152000	3158000	Oh, you know, why did your friend Billy send me this link? What is what is two girls, one cup? What is this?
3158000	3165000	You know, it's actually hilarious. Dan's grandmother is super into the internet. She does her genealogy.
3166000	3178000	Oh, that's my dad. That's my dad. She's probably one of the most computer literate people in her age group that did not start off in programming or engineering that I know.
3178000	3186000	And it's pretty neat to watch her. However, my maternal grandmother, she will like poke around a little bit and maybe look at Facebook and then that's it.
3186000	3192000	My granny's like, no, those things. I don't want to look at them. Your daddy's going to mess with that. Not me.
3192000	3206000	Whereas my mother is all about Twitter. She doesn't post on it. I told I told her, Mom, if you would use Twitter, I could give out your name and you would have so many followers because your tweets would be like you need to tweet about American Idol and shit and things that get you really angry.
3206000	3214000	But she just she loves to read it. She'll tell me about, you know, what Kathy Griffin and Cher posting on Twitter and and all the people that she follows.
3214000	3219000	It's like that's the Internet. I love Kathy Griffin and Cher and Anderson Cooper.
3220000	3227000	They all need to do a buddy comedy. All right. We have distanced ourselves way away from the original topic, which means next topic, Dark Sakura.
3227000	3235000	Oh, yes. My turn, isn't it? God damn it, Rob. Making me work. Well, there's a little game called Fire Emblem.
3235000	3245000	And this is actually for Fire Emblem Awakening Summer Scramble is the new DLC. It's out in North America and Europe.
3245000	3255000	But they have censored a scene. There is a character named Tharja who I guess she's like pulling out her underwear or something or pulling it up.
3255000	3268000	But the edit that they made to it makes it even worse because there's like a piece of cloth now, like a curtain or something that's flowed in between where her butt is.
3268000	3275000	And so all you see is like if you weren't looking for the little strap on the side, it would look like she's got her hands in her ass.
3275000	3282000	Like she's digging her fingers and she's self muppeting. It's I like that.
3282000	3288000	I'm going to have to work in the more conversations. Is that an urban dictionary? That should be, though.
3288000	3293000	But like, it's just the OK.
3293000	3299000	And this is my big thing about censorship, is that the only reason the shit's a big deal is because you make it a fucking big deal.
3299000	3307000	You know, it's like the approach I take, I take to quote foul language around kids.
3307000	3312000	You know, if you're not supposed to say the words, that's just going to make it all the more attractive to say it.
3312000	3316000	You know, if you'd act like it's not a big deal to them, it's not a big deal.
3316000	3322000	Same goes with, you know, censorship of, you know, a woman pulling up her underwear.
3322000	3327000	The way that they edit. It's a bathing suit.
3327000	3337000	What they did to this, it just makes it look even worse because it went, you know, when you give somebody a clear, concrete picture, it leaves a little room to the imagination.
3337000	3347000	Like black bars. Exactly. We did this in college is that we were making a music video and we had the guy stand out in just a pair of like gym shorts.
3347000	3352000	But when we did the movie, we put a black bar over it because it was supposed to be the girls.
3352000	3356000	Why am I talking about this on the show? We did like a Spice Girls music video for a college project.
3356000	3361000	And at the end of the video, the girls talking, shut up. The girls steal his clothes.
3361000	3365000	And so at the end, he's just standing there with a black bar over it. Well, he didn't get naked for us.
3365000	3369000	He was wearing gym shorts and we put the black bar over it and it looked like he was naked.
3369000	3374000	It's an illusion. And your pervy little minds don't think, oh, he's wearing gym shorts.
3374000	3377000	They think, oh, well, it's like you had to block his penis.
3377000	3381000	Well, it's like you can also, here's a good example of the Austin Powers movie.
3381000	3386000	The first one. Oh, God. Yes. With the cantaloupe. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3386000	3393000	She had like red pasties over the jumblies to steal Mystique's word.
3393000	3401000	But I mean, when you take away the concrete image and you put just something in front of it,
3401000	3404000	it's going to leave a lot more to the imagination.
3404000	3415000	And in the end, I think it's going to, you know, probably be more unintentionally explicit,
3415000	3420000	because the brain, if it can be porned, the brain will porn it.
3421000	3426000	And too, since I worked in a classy reference to Joe Dirt in the last topic,
3426000	3428000	I'm going to reference Bioshock Infinite in this one.
3428000	3432000	The mind of the subject will desperately struggle to create memories where none exists.
3432000	3437000	In other words, they will undress the bitch when they can't see her clothes.
3438000	3441000	And also think of the children. Think of the children.
3443000	3447000	How many children are playing Fire Emblem? How many children can understand Fire Emblem?
3447000	3450000	It's a 3DS game. All of the children are playing Fire Emblem.
3450000	3454000	I guess I say that and then I'm like, oh, wait a minute, Rob, when you were 10,
3454000	3457000	you were totally playing Final Fantasy. So I guess.
3457000	3462000	Here's another fun example, because Prince Brightstar mentioned the black bars in Japan.
3462000	3470000	Remember when we got Final Fuck X and it was all squared out, the pixelated?
3470000	3472000	I was like, we know that's badge.
3472000	3478000	OK, we need to switch topic stat, Loki.
3478000	3480000	For the record, that was entirely hilarious.
3481000	3486000	It was just cosplay porn. I mean, there wasn't even any male characters that were dressed up like Final Fantasy characters.
3486000	3488000	It was really good cosplay, though.
3489000	3496000	Fine. Anyway, so there was a game that came out called Scribblenauts Unlimited,
3496000	3501000	and they keep adding stuff each year. Well, this year they added some mames.
3501000	3509000	And to go along with that, Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat were some of the characters featured in the game.
3509000	3512000	And guess what? They're copyrighted.
3512000	3515000	But apparently Fissel or Warner Brothers didn't really give a shit,
3515000	3519000	or just were blatantly unaware that things get copyrighted on the Internet and that kind of stuff.
3519000	3527000	So, yeah, apparently the creators of those two properties are a little pissed off,
3527000	3529000	and they have filed a lawsuit.
3529000	3536000	Because, apparently, neither Fissel or Warner Brothers were even acknowledging it.
3536000	3538000	Just kind of like, eh.
3539000	3540000	And, you know, they-
3540000	3542000	It's just some Internet kids.
3542000	3553000	And, you know, they do support the fact that people make things on the Internet for non-profit stuff, and that's fine.
3553000	3557000	But this is clearly for-profit. It was something that they advertised to the game, saying,
3557000	3560000	hey, look, Nyan Cat's in there, and Keyboard Cat, you should buy this game.
3560000	3562000	And people were like, oh, cool, I'm gonna buy the game because of that.
3563000	3564000	So, yeah.
3564000	3568000	Well, just like the Nintendo version had Mario and Luigi in it, and they had to work out that deal with Nintendo.
3568000	3570000	That's why they're not in the PC version, right?
3570000	3571000	Mm-hmm.
3571000	3572000	It's very similar.
3572000	3574000	I kind of think a lot of this is ignorance.
3574000	3578000	I kind of think- I don't think the developers meant to do this maliciously.
3578000	3579000	No, I don't think that's malicious.
3579000	3585000	I don't- I think they just thought, oh, Nyan Cat's like this 4chan thing, nobody really owns it, so let's just, you know, lift it.
3585000	3587000	It'll be funny for our game.
3587000	3595000	But, now that WB, the parent company, is not returning these guys' phone calls, who, yeah, it is a trademark thing or whatever,
3595000	3599000	now they're pissed off, and this is their warning shot to get noticed.
3599000	3601000	It'll get settled out of court, as these things always do.
3602000	3603000	Yeah.
3603000	3604000	But, uh, very interesting.
3604000	3607000	The precedent for the meme stuff is very interesting.
3607000	3610000	And how this could affect future Scrimble lot games.
3610000	3616000	I don't think the keyboard cat thing is as- like, the Nyan Cat, yeah, that one's gonna be pretty hard to defend,
3616000	3618000	because that looks just like the little kitty.
3618000	3621000	But the keyboard cat is just a cat sitting at the piano.
3621000	3624000	It doesn't have that song, I don't even think the colors are right.
3624000	3628000	I don't- and keyboard cat's a little trickier.
3628000	3631000	I kind of think that's just thrown in for good measure.
3631000	3633000	I don't know if that has quite the legal-
3633000	3636000	They also have, like, long cat and stuff, I think, are in the game, and-
3636000	3637000	But I don't think anybody owns long cat.
3637000	3638000	No, I don't think so.
3638000	3639000	Yeah.
3639000	3642000	Um, now I wanna know if, um, My Body is Ready is in there.
3644000	3645000	And then what that does-
3645000	3648000	Uh, My Body is Ready is not a noun, though, so...
3648000	3649000	And, um...
3649000	3651000	Did I say a noun? I think I did.
3651000	3652000	Noun.
3654000	3658000	But, I mean, there- I- I think that, though, um,
3658000	3664000	I know that there are a number of memes out there that are, um, under copyright.
3664000	3669000	And I think that they're well- well within their right to pursue action.
3669000	3670000	Sure.
3670000	3676000	And especially, um, I really- and this is maybe just a- a guilty pleasure.
3676000	3678000	I love seeing the big companies taken down a notch.
3678000	3679000	Yeah.
3679000	3682000	I mean, there's a lot of people quick to defend Scribblenauts and stuff,
3682000	3686000	and it's not- it's not that I'm, like, anti-Scribblenauts or I wanna see Scribblenauts.
3686000	3688000	No, I love Scribblenauts. It's a cute game and so forth.
3688000	3692000	But, okay, I also like the internet culture and a lot of what the internet brings up.
3692000	3698000	It actually- some of these meme things, I really like to see how it turns around some people's lives.
3698000	3702000	Like, think about that chick, the, um, ain't nobody got time for that when she was on the local news.
3702000	3705000	She's got, like, commercial deals now.
3705000	3706000	Or Antoine.
3706000	3710000	Like, things- that guy, there was a really interesting development with him this week.
3710000	3714000	But, yeah, I mean, for all practical purposes, he's, you know, did a lot with his stuff, too.
3714000	3716000	The whole, they're clamming in your windows, they're snatching people up.
3716000	3719000	You know, they milk their fifteen minutes of fame.
3719000	3723000	And it ends up being a happy ending of sorts.
3723000	3725000	Actually, I think that Queen Semia in chat is right.
3725000	3727000	Keyboard Cat is copyrighted or trademarked.
3727000	3728000	Yes.
3728000	3736000	Because, well, the guy, actually, I remember watching an interview where he licensed out his cat's likeness for the pistachio commercial.
3736000	3742000	Right. But the cat in Scribblenauts doesn't really look like it like Nyan Cat does.
3742000	3746000	It can be considered enough derivative, but I think copyright law is, what, fifty percent change?
3746000	3749000	Yeah, I think, I think that would be the harder one to prove.
3749000	3753000	Well, and also the fact that you sum it by typing Keyboard Cat.
3753000	3756000	You know, that's true. Or Nyan Cat.
3756000	3759000	But one could argue, well, it is a cat at the keyboard. I don't know.
3759000	3762000	It is a cat that's Nyan.
3762000	3765000	I still want my body is ready to be in there.
3765000	3769000	That's not a noun. Reggie Fils-Aime could be in there in the Nintendo version.
3769000	3772000	I bet if you type that in, the only thing that happens is his jaw comes out.
3772000	3775000	The game just punches you in the face. That's what happens.
3775000	3776000	Or starts printing money.
3776000	3780000	SSJ100Matt in chat says, 4chan the game. Ain't nobody got time for that.
3780000	3785000	I thought that's what Scribblenauts kind of like was, was its big selling point. Was that it had all these memes in it.
3785000	3791000	Oh, those stupid guys that were sitting behind us at the baseball game. They're like, foul ball. Ain't nobody got time for that.
3791000	3795000	I about laughed my ass off, but I was, I was actually thinking of you doing your impression.
3795000	3800000	Honey Brown. What's her name? Honey Brown or whatever her name is. She'd go sue those guys.
3800000	3802000	Yeah. All right.
3802000	3804000	And yes, you get ceiling cat.
3804000	3805000	Yes, ceiling cat's there.
3805000	3808000	The ceiling cat isn't trademarked.
3808000	3810000	Grumpy cat. I bet is.
3810000	3811000	Grumpy cat is.
3811000	3813000	So he better not show up in the next Scribblenauts.
3813000	3814000	We all loved Tard.
3814000	3820000	All right. I'm sure a lot of you guys heard about this next story. It was making the rounds everywhere. It's, it's kind of lolsy.
3820000	3825000	It's about the game Game Dev Tycoon. No relation to the game dev story.
3825000	3833000	But Game Dev Tycoon came out this past week on Windows, Macs and Linux and Green Heart Games, the folks behind it.
3833000	3839000	And they did this interesting thing to kind of combat piracy, which I guess was some type of experiment or whatever.
3839000	3847000	And what they did is they put up a copy of the game on one of the big torrent sites and with a little info file that you'd see with most cracked games.
3847000	3850000	That says, you know, fully cracked, playable, dah, dah, dah.
3850000	3860000	But in an old throwback to, let's say, the Earthbound pirate copies of many years ago, it would change the game significantly to make it unbeatable.
3860000	3862000	How does it change the game?
3862000	3867000	Well, at some point, piracy starts taking over your game development office.
3867000	3870000	You'll get a little message that pops up on the screen that says,
3870000	3876000	Boss, it seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally.
3876000	3880000	If players don't buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.
3880000	3884000	You have to click on a little frown to continue. You can't beat the game at this point.
3884000	3889000	And of course it has all these people posting on internet forums about it.
3889000	3895000	Like, how do I get the piracy to stop in the game? Which is just giving away how many people were pirating it.
3895000	3900000	Very similar as well to, didn't they do this with Arkham Asylum? Not City, but Asylum.
3900000	3903000	They had, like, a whole thing where Batman couldn't make a certain jump.
3903000	3907000	And people were posting on forums about this, and WB just went ban, ban, ban, ban.
3907000	3910000	Because these were all the people, yeah, that were pirating it.
3910000	3920000	Anyway, this guy was collecting anonymous usage statistics and found that it was, what, over 90% of the copies of this being played were pirated.
3920000	3922000	Crazy.
3922000	3931000	But, were those people going to actually play the game legitimately in the first place, or did they just find it when they were browsing new games that are added to the Pirate Bay?
3931000	3938000	Because he put it out there himself, you know, on the Pirate Bay, and people were downloading it.
3938000	3948000	And let's not forget that other indie companies have put out their game on the Pirate Bay to drive up interest in the game and to, you know, get people to test the game out.
3949000	3963000	So, that's my thing is, I wonder, I'm not saying that someone confused that for this, I'm sure that people are just pirating, but you can't attribute, if you didn't do that, would your game really be pirated that fast?
3963000	3968000	And would it, you still have the same, you know, statistics, I guess. That's my thing.
3968000	3973000	So, if anything, the whole reason behind this is now, it's just for the controversy.
3973000	3978000	Because, now it got picked up by all these websites, and now all these people are writing stories about it.
3978000	3979000	Well, okay.
3979000	3985000	And now he has a legit version out there, and now everyone's like, oh, we gotta support the indies, let's go buy this game, even though, you know, you may or may not want to play it.
3985000	3994000	Well, either way, okay, either way you slice this pie low-key, whether you want to say it was the piracy mechanism or the exposure, genius, genius move.
3994000	4001000	No matter which way you slice it, whatever angle they were, either it was a genius anti-piracy scheme or it was a genius marketing scheme.
4001000	4008000	But it's not very, it's not very honest in the fact that, you know, basically they're, it's kind of like, I would say, like entrapment almost.
4008000	4016000	The irony of you saying entrapping pirates is not very honest. The irony, it hurts, it's burning.
4016000	4017000	Well, there's a-
4017000	4018000	I need ice cubes.
4018000	4026000	I feel less, I feel less sorry about a company that puts their game up there by themselves versus a game getting leaked to the internet.
4026000	4029000	What were you gonna say, Jamie? Sorry, I had to make my point.
4029000	4033000	Breakman was saying using Pirate Bay as your game testers.
4035000	4038000	It does end up being kind of like a demo of sorts.
4042000	4045000	I mean, cool, you know, cool that people are checking out their game.
4046000	4049000	I'm sure that's what they want in the end and hopefully it works out for them.
4049000	4050000	Yeah.
4050000	4057000	I personally am not going to pick up this game. It may have been, you know, the fact that it's compared to Game Dev Story, it's a little similar to that.
4057000	4062000	Might be intriguing, but after what they did, fuck them. I'm not buying it. I'm not playing it either.
4062000	4065000	So you are personally offended by this little move?
4065000	4071000	I just think it's shady. It's so shady. There's, like, there's a difference between, like, putting-
4071000	4073000	But the Pirate Bay is shady!
4073000	4083000	No, no, no, hold on. There's a difference between putting something in your game, you know, like Scribbl- not Scribblats, but like the Michael Jackson game on 3DS, or on DS, or-
4083000	4085000	Oh, the Vuvuzela thing. Somebody just brought that up in chat.
4085000	4090000	Or, like, the Batman stuff, programming a little thing in there to catch pirates when the game gets leaked out.
4090000	4094000	Okay, that's something. That's kind of cool that they've got that in there and you can catch people doing it.
4094000	4101000	But the fact that you go, oh, we're gonna show these pirates, we're gonna upload a real co- I mean, come on, that's stupid.
4101000	4109000	It's like saying, oh, I'm gonna open up my house and I'm gonna say, hey, come steal my shit, and then get pissed off that people are stealing my shit.
4109000	4115000	I'm sorry, that's just stupid. It's stupid. And you think you're gonna teach these people moral?
4115000	4122000	It's one of those things, like, to say that this is gonna work in the game, people will buy your game, it's just like those stupid advertisements before they-
4122000	4127000	Think about the lighting rig, people! They're out of jobs because you pirate your movies!
4128000	4130000	I'm sorry, it's just stupid.
4130000	4139000	Okay, let's say we're about ready to put out a CD of exclusive Orange Lounge Radio material and things that, you know, never before heard on the show,
4139000	4142000	and that's how we're gonna pay for our hosting for the next year. Hypothetical situation.
4142000	4150000	How do I make sure that that CD does not get pirated without possibly offending the pirates out there in the world?
4150000	4156000	You can't. It's music, you're not gonna be able to. There's no DRM that you can put on that.
4156000	4165000	So, bend over and take it. And enjoy it. Put it out there for free yourself and just hope they'll rally behind you because you're one of them.
4165000	4172000	Most likely, here's the thing, the situation with that is, you're not gonna have a whole lot of interest of people putting it up.
4172000	4179000	They're not gonna leak it out there because they just don't- they figure that, you know, if there's no interest in trying to get the game,
4179000	4182000	they're not gonna necessarily put it out there or, you know, the content.
4182000	4191000	So, for example, I can't find copies of maybe somebody VHS, you know, recording episodes of Being Bobby Brown.
4191000	4200000	That's just not on the internet at all. My wife is wanting me to search high and low and I will till, you know, the day I die to find copies of that.
4200000	4201000	But it's just not up there.
4201000	4207000	For Being Bobby Brown, I will endorse piracy because everybody has to see that, Bobby!
4207000	4214000	It's fantastic but, you know, Whitney was a bitch and she fucking took all- you know, had her lawyers take all that shit down.
4214000	4215000	Babe in total control of herself.
4215000	4221000	Exactly. And she, you know, had everybody, you know, take, you know, the copies off the internet.
4221000	4224000	Not necessarily, just like a lot of the clips too are just gone.
4224000	4230000	So, unfortunately, you know, there's that but I just don't think anyone would pirate our CD.
4230000	4234000	I mean, sure, they could leak it out there but is anyone really gonna care to download it?
4234000	4239000	Okay. So when it comes to- maybe my example about music was a bad one.
4239000	4245000	But when it comes to games, you had Tim here on the show last night whose job is in the industry making games like Tomb Raider.
4245000	4254000	What is an effective DRM strategy that we can do to make sure that as many games as possible sell legitimately so people like Tim can continue to be employed?
4254000	4257000	Free to play. Because you basically-
4257000	4258000	Everything's gotta go free to play.
4259000	4261000	Everything's gotta go free to play.
4261000	4268000	And I'm not saying free to play to the point of, you know, it doesn't even have to necessarily be free to play, like cheap to play I guess.
4268000	4271000	You know, like $10 games with a ton of DLC.
4271000	4277000	DLC that makes sense, not just, oh you're out of energy points, you gotta buy some DLC to be able to play this game longer.
4277000	4281000	Not anything retarded like that but actually supported DLC.
4281000	4289000	I mean, granted the game might be shorter because it's more of a demo but that's- what I'm saying is basically you get a small amount of content.
4289000	4294000	For example, Ridge Racer for the Vita would have worked perfectly like that except they charged $40 for it.
4294000	4297000	Or $30 for four tracks. It's ridiculous.
4297000	4302000	If they put it out for like five bucks or ten- probably like five bucks would be perfect.
4302000	4307000	Okay, Bobby's retort in chat, it's a fair one, I gotta put it out there. This was an $8 game and it was still pirated.
4308000	4309000	It's still a game.
4309000	4316000	But yeah, I understand that. It may be an $8 game but once again, they put it out there first, they put it out there.
4316000	4317000	Would an $8 game-
4317000	4318000	Shots fired!
4318000	4321000	Would an $8 game be leaked that quickly?
4321000	4326000	That's the question. How quickly would an $8 indie game be leaked out to the internet?
4326000	4329000	There's people who leak games just because they can.
4329000	4336000	I understand that they can leak games but if there's DRM on, I mean, I'm assuming it's DRM free but let's assume that there was DRM on it.
4336000	4341000	Would really someone spend the time to crack this game and put it out there?
4341000	4344000	I mean, sure, there's probably somebody out there that would do it.
4344000	4349000	But I don't know if it's gonna have as big of a draw once now it's all controversial.
4349000	4355000	I would actually agree with you to an extent that we have to find a way to get the price of games down.
4355000	4363000	And I realize cartridges used to cost 70 bucks and the price we're paying for games now is actually cheaper than they used to be with inflation.
4363000	4369000	But with everything else going on in the world, I honestly think we have to find a way to get the price of games down to like 30 or 40 bucks.
4369000	4373000	Because when do people these days buy most of their PC games?
4373000	4376000	Steam, sales, when everything gets super cheap, you know?
4376000	4378000	I love Steam so much.
4378000	4387000	I think that's the thing and you gotta find that balance between how much do I charge for it and make sure enough people buy it so that I recoup my costs.
4387000	4391000	But Steam's also a double-edged sword too because now there's games that come out on PC.
4391000	4397000	I might think of buying Bioshock Infinite on PC as well as on 360.
4397000	4401000	Because I already have the 360 version but I may buy it on PC.
4401000	4403000	But am I gonna pay full price for it? Fuck no!
4403000	4414000	I'm gonna wait for a sale because they have sales all the damn time on Steam, on Amazon, on Green Man Gaming, on Gamefly with Steam DRM, on wherever.
4414000	4418000	You're gonna find these games marked down to like nothing.
4418000	4420000	And that's the kind of mentality.
4420000	4423000	I mean, lookit, Tomb Raider is just half-priced.
4423000	4426000	That game out like two months ago? A month ago?
4426000	4430000	I mean, shit, you can't do this with console games.
4430000	4432000	They're not dropping that fast.
4432000	4434000	They're not gonna be five bucks one day and then the next day...
4434000	4436000	Well, some do.
4436000	4441000	Well, some do, but I'm talking about Tomb Raider, a game that sold quite a bit.
4441000	4443000	And it's totally not a disappointment to anybody.
4443000	4446000	Gameguru in chat says,
4446000	4451000	Well, I believe DRM is rather stupid. What the game dev tycoon guys did was actually pretty clever.
4451000	4453000	Breakman says,
4453000	4460000	Dev equal, I'll give you $20 to go buy this $10 game. Loki equal, fuck that. Then I'll have to go out of my way. I'm just gonna pirate it.
4460000	4464000	I don't pirate games anymore.
4465000	4471000	I mean, I don't pirate games to play them early and then buy the game.
4471000	4473000	But you don't pirate them any less?
4473000	4475000	Yes, I don't pirate them any less.
4475000	4479000	No, I don't pirate PC games anymore, for sure.
4479000	4484000	Maybe to play them a little early, yes, but I do buy them always.
4484000	4487000	But never to just play them because I don't want...
4487000	4491000	Because it's so easy now with Steam. It's like a few bucks and you got a game.
4492000	4494000	It becomes too convenient.
4494000	4499000	Piracy versus convenience. Is piracy more convenient? No.
4499000	4506000	But if a game gets leaked out that's supposed to be out in a couple months and I can play it way early,
4506000	4509000	I'm all about playing games as soon as I can.
4509000	4515000	If Grand Theft Auto 5 gets leaked out tomorrow, you better believe I'm gonna find a way to get it.
4515000	4518000	But you better believe I'm gonna be buying it when it comes out.
4518000	4524000	I do believe developers, if they really want to protect their property, need to figure...
4524000	4528000	A. Global releases for everything because that's just the world we live in.
4528000	4532000	And B. You need to cut down this window or figure out a way.
4532000	4538000	If these review copies that go out, I think review copies ought to have the DRM in them and the stringent stuff.
4538000	4541000	What's the deal? They're free to the people.
4541000	4546000	We need to make sure that these review copies don't get out into the wild because that's what ruins all the day one sales.
4546000	4549000	That's the gap they've got to close.
4549000	4555000	It's not even really review copies because of the whole Far Cry 3, Blood Dragon, or whatever.
4555000	4557000	That was a hack on Uplay.
4557000	4562000	But there are some other stuff that gets leaked out from duplicators or games.
4562000	4568000	They go to retail early because they street date stuff and they get shipped to the retailer a week early.
4568000	4572000	So then that gets leaked out by some employee.
4572000	4579000	But then there's like the Microsoft games that come out a month ahead time and I'm assuming that's duplicators because I can't see how the hell it could leak any earlier than that.
4579000	4582000	Alright, I'm sure we'll get some emails on this at a later date.
4582000	4585000	OrangeOnsRadio, excuse me, mailbag at OrangeOnsRadio.com.
4585000	4594000	I do actually want to say there's been a couple cases where I've downloaded PC games through a torrent site because the servers were down for the actual site.
4594000	4596000	And I had a key to play it. Just saying.
4596000	4601000	Sometimes, especially if you play Ragnarok online, sometimes it's the only way to get it.
4601000	4605000	Alright, let's move on with more news. We're running long, so DarkSakura.
4605000	4607000	Alright, let me get it.
4607000	4617000	Now, there is, for people who are fans of Eternal Darkness, there is a spiritual successor called Shadow of the Eternals that's been announced.
4617000	4633000	In fact, there's already a bunch of information out on it saying that it's going to be out on PC and Wii U and that they are trying to score 1.5 million to fund the game.
4633000	4645000	I'm sure it's going to be interesting. What I'm not seeing is if it's a Kickstarter or not out yet for that.
4645000	4653000	But they are wanting to have this, do it episodic and have it out by Q3 2014.
4653000	4657000	Cool.
4658000	4668000	Some people I know on Twitter are not big fans of this idea. I mean, as much as Eternal Darkness was awesome, apparently the guy who made it, Dennis Dyack, hasn't made a lot of winners.
4668000	4672000	So they're not sure if this is something worth supporting. But he'll get the money.
4672000	4684000	Well, it looks like it's going to be produced through Precursor Games. So, Canadian group. Good games are coming out of Canada.
4684000	4691000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming a little bit sooner than things that are getting Kickstarted right now.
4691000	4693000	Loki, start us off with US.
4693000	4697000	There's nothing coming up this week. Seriously, nothing.
4697000	4700000	Really? Nothing. Not a damn thing?
4700000	4706000	Nothing until the 14th and 14th would be Metro 20, not 23, Metro Last Light on the 14th.
4706000	4711000	Why is that? Is that just because it's a slow time of year? They figure everybody is seeing Iron Man.
4711000	4720000	It's a slow time of the year, usually. There's still quite a few releases coming out, but I think we're getting that pre-console launch lull.
4720000	4729000	And so we don't have a lot of games coming out. There was supposed to be the Wii U version of Deus Ex Human Revolution, but that is now TVA.
4729000	4737000	So, no idea what's going on there. They've delayed it or if they're canceling development on it or what.
4737000	4744000	Very interesting. Well, going over to Japan and looking at the releases there, guess what? There is nothing coming out in Japan either.
4744000	4752000	Actually, one game. One game on the Sony PSP. PSP game still selling. Kudwafter, Converted Edition. I think we talked about this last week.
4752000	4753000	Kudwafter!
4753000	4759000	Yeah, we had nothing last week either, so I think we already talked about this game, but it's a very, very slow period in Japan right now.
4759000	4764000	But Dark Sakura, you were talking a little bit earlier about the whole holidays in Japan and Gold Week.
4764000	4767000	Golden Week was this past week and Children's Week is this week.
4767000	4770000	So this is likely having an impact on all these releases.
4770000	4777000	Well, I mean, Golden Week is actually, from what I understand, kind of hard to sell anything because nobody's there.
4777000	4784000	Golden Week is when you go home to visit your family, so this week would be, I think, a lot busier for sales.
4784000	4786000	How about the UK, Dark Sakura?
4786000	4802000	We have a very few things in the UK. On the 9th, we have Sid Meier's Ace Patrol and the 10th Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut for Wii U and Persona 4 The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4802000	4807000	So I'm sure our buddy Magi is very happy about that, as he told me earlier that he was happy.
4807000	4811000	Because he said after he wrote us that letter that he found out it was coming out.
4811000	4812000	Nice.
4812000	4815000	And the new Shin Megami Tensei.
4815000	4816000	Very cool.
4816000	4821000	Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.
4821000	4826000	Apparently there's another lawsuit going on now against EA for their Madden franchise.
4826000	4834000	Apparently this was from a guy named Robin Antonic and he was the designer of John Madden Football for 8-bit computers.
4834000	4836000	And it's actually going to trial.
4836000	4849000	And apparently, I guess, he's seeking cuts from all of the games sold so far because they've used a lot of the design that was in his game.
4849000	4855000	And they've just failed to compensate him or even credit him. In fact, actually...
4855000	4860000	Madden 25 out this year, right? 25 years. 25 sequels to Madden.
4860000	4870000	Yes. And they've actually, I mean, there was on one of the boxes credits him for the Madden games.
4870000	4878000	And now it's just, you know, nothing. No sort of royalties or anything. Even though he was a co-creator of the series.
4878000	4884000	I don't know. It sounds like he has a pretty strong case. It'll be interesting to see if he can settle out of court or not.
4884000	4886000	Of course it will. They always...
4886000	4888000	It says it's going to trial, so we never know.
4888000	4892000	Just because it goes to trial. First day of the trial. Oh, he reached an agreement. Go figure.
4892000	4899000	That happened to me once when I was on jury duty. We were sitting in the little hallway waiting to go in the room.
4899000	4902000	I didn't even know what the case was about. I didn't know if it was criminal, civil, what.
4902000	4906000	We're sitting in the hallway waiting to go in the room and then we're sitting there for like an hour, an hour and a half.
4906000	4911000	They come out and say, oh, they just settled, so we're going to have you guys all go back to the jury room.
4911000	4913000	Yeah, I've had that happen before today.
4913000	4920000	Like, okay. It's a game of chicken. How far are we going to go? Are we actually going to get the jury in here?
4920000	4923000	Man, jury duty is great. It's like your chance to sit and read a book.
4923000	4929000	Yeah, jury duty is not so bad. Maybe it's just this particular county, because here in Sacramento it's just one day or one trial.
4929000	4932000	And they actually have really decent snacks in the cafeteria.
4932000	4934000	And that's super important.
4934000	4940000	I've actually, I made a friend that was in our wow guild because we were both on jury duty.
4940000	4948000	And we're sitting in the hallway freaking talking about our draenei and how we were looking forward to seeing what the new expansion was.
4948000	4950000	And we were all so disappointed. But yeah.
4950000	4963000	The last time I was on jury duty, I was playing, I want to say it was Final Fantasy IV, the after years, but wasn't that only on Wii at the time?
4963000	4968000	Yes. So it must have just been Final Fantasy IV. Maybe that's when the DS cartridge came out. I bet that's what it was.
4968000	4971000	And I was playing the crap out of that for jury duty.
4971000	4977000	I just remember being so bored sitting at home. No, it wasn't because I was actually working at that other place.
4977000	4981000	But I went in for my jury duty and it gave me a chance to read my book and get my stuff done.
4981000	4989000	And I sadly didn't get picked for a jury because I kind of wanted to be on one so I could have the people's court thing going in my head.
4990000	4993000	I sat on one in 2006. It was terrible.
4993000	4995000	I want a nice, long murder trial.
4995000	4997000	No, you don't. Be careful what you wish for.
4997000	5003000	Because I was on a two week trial for a criminal case that was bad. It wasn't murder, but it was very, very, very bad stuff.
5003000	5009000	And it's like one of those, I'm glad I got to do my civic duty. I'm glad I got to see Law and Order play out in front of me.
5009000	5014000	Because the very animated prosecutor was awesome to watch. She was great.
5014000	5018000	But I never want to be on a trial like that again in my life.
5018000	5023000	But I actually don't mind the waiting for it just because it gives me a chance to read.
5024000	5026000	Alright, anyhow. How do we get on jury duty?
5026000	5028000	Well, it must be, it's like...
5028000	5029000	Video games and jury duty.
5029000	5033000	Well, it's legal week here on OLR because guess what my story is about?
5033000	5034000	Another lawsuit.
5034000	5040000	And this is one of those, oh, we must have seen this coming after all the internet rage about Mass Effect 3.
5040000	5042000	I remember when somebody tried to sue there.
5042000	5044000	Well, guess what game got targeted this time?
5044000	5046000	Aliens Colonial Marines.
5046000	5048000	That's right. Sega and Gearbox.
5048000	5057000	Class action lawsuit against them saying you knowingly misrepresented Aliens Colonial Marines at trade show demos.
5057000	5059000	Fascinating.
5059000	5061000	And a lot of people were bitching about this too.
5061000	5065000	Like the game that came out did not match what they were showing at E3 and all this.
5065000	5067000	So, but I don't know.
5067000	5071000	Like can you sue a movie because the movie wasn't as good as the trailer?
5071000	5075000	And they put stuff in the trailer all the time that doesn't end up in the real movie.
5075000	5077000	I don't know though.
5077000	5084000	Well, you know, I would like, you know, the two hours of my life back for Mortal Kombat resurrection or whatever the crap it was.
5084000	5089000	And I totally blame Jessica and Ross for making me watch that. Actually, I blame Ross for making me watch that movie.
5089000	5096000	But I didn't go demand, you know, that people give me money or anything for a shitty movie.
5097000	5099000	I mean, I pretty much knew it was shit anyway.
5099000	5102000	But the trailers made it look a lot more interesting than it actually was.
5102000	5104000	And it was the sequel to the first one.
5104000	5106000	It was actually really boring and stupid.
5106000	5111000	Alright, anyhow, Timegate Studios, maybe they can see this coming, the end is coming.
5111000	5116000	Because, of course, they are the developer behind Aliens Colonial Marines co-developer.
5116000	5118000	And they also developed a game called Section 8.
5118000	5123000	They filed for bankruptcy protection at the Texas Southern Bankruptcy Court.
5123000	5127000	Apparently, owing their creditors between $10 and $50 million in debt.
5127000	5130000	That's a hell of a price range. That's a very odd estimate.
5130000	5133000	But, yeah, Timegate seeking protection against creditors.
5133000	5138000	Now, granted, they aren't the target of this lawsuit per se.
5138000	5146000	But, yeah, don't release a game as bad as Aliens Colonial Marines, people.
5146000	5148000	Because in this day and age, you'll get sued over it.
5149000	5151000	How dare you waste my time?
5153000	5156000	Then again, $60 for a game. It's a big chunk of change.
5156000	5162000	And also, they had, you know, all the media that was from it was from the, you know, pre-release thing.
5162000	5165000	So, there was nothing like ads development goes.
5165000	5170000	Oh, hey, yeah, we had to scale back this up because it wouldn't run on a console.
5170000	5174000	Alright, well, let's travel to a time when things were a lot simpler.
5176000	5177000	To the intro of our show.
5177000	5179000	We got a new theme back in the day. Thank you.
5179000	5182000	When we first started the show this evening, before we started...
5183000	5186000	Long, long time ago. A couple hours.
5186000	5189000	Back then, we weren't talking about Final Fuck X.
5189000	5192000	We were just talking about, you know, blowjobs. I don't know.
5197000	5199000	It's the classic game of the week.
5199000	5205000	You know, back in the day, you would buy a game like, I don't know, what was it?
5205000	5206000	ET.
5206000	5207000	What was a really terrible game?
5207000	5210000	Okay, ET. And you know what? You just got stuck with it.
5210000	5213000	There was no class action lawsuit because ET sucked.
5213000	5219000	Alright, DarkSakura, go into the gaming vault and find a game that, hey, the kids should be playing this week.
5219000	5220000	What is the classic game of the week?
5220000	5224000	The classic game of the week is Magical Chase for the PC Engine.
5224000	5226000	Also known as the TurboGrafx.
5227000	5237000	I will tell you right now that this is one of the holy grails of the U.S. Turbo graphics games.
5237000	5240000	Because they did like five copies in the U.S.
5240000	5246000	I actually, I don't even, I would like a copy of this because it's actually a really neat little game.
5246000	5253000	Magical Chase was put out by Palsoft and released by Quest on the PC Engine.
5253000	5256000	Came out in 1991 in Japan and 1993 in the U.S.
5256000	5260000	And you play as a little witch named Ripple who flies on a broomstick.
5260000	5264000	I swear I used to get this confused with cotton back in the day for the record.
5264000	5266000	But you have...
5266000	5269000	It reminds me of cotton. I was going to ask if it was in that same series.
5269000	5273000	No, it's not. Compile, I think, did cotton, didn't it?
5273000	5275000	Yeah.
5276000	5284000	Anyway, you have these little stars with you called Star Maidens and they act as your options like Ingradius.
5284000	5291000	And that's funny, the article even compares to cotton. Success did cotton, not compile.
5291000	5298000	But it was one of the last games that was released in the U.S. for the TurboGrafx, Turbo Duo.
5298000	5304000	And had a ton of hype and now it's like you'd be hard pressed to find a copy.
5304000	5310000	So as you play through the game, you have normal and hard difficulty settings.
5310000	5314000	You can only play the first three levels on easy.
5318000	5321000	Once your enemies are destroyed, they leave gemstones behind.
5321000	5326000	So that's your currency in games. You can buy power-ups, health, extra lives.
5326000	5329000	Except on the third six levels, it only appears once.
5329000	5334000	Touching stuff on the ground does not kill you, but it does slow you down.
5334000	5338000	And if you get trapped behind objects, you get scrolling damage.
5338000	5354000	You have your different levels. You have Cubolagon, Dodon Grin, Kamikaze Dangan, Fat Metal, which just sounds funny, Gemini Snow, and then the Sixth Seal.
5354000	5363000	So there are other ports. They did a version for Windows 95, 98 that came out in 1998.
5363000	5370000	And then they did Magical Chase GB for the Game Boy Color, only in Japan on August 4th, 2000.
5370000	5379000	And like I said, it's rare. In fact, I was about to eBay it just to see exactly if there's any copies on eBay right now.
5379000	5381000	So let's find out.
5382000	5387000	And honestly, it's a cute little game. I like that level because it looks like she's flying over Tetris blocks.
5387000	5389000	It does, yeah. This is a cute little...
5389000	5390000	It's just the beginning of the game, too.
5390000	5392000	Very cartoony game. I like this.
5392000	5395000	Kind of Fantasy Zone, in a way. The art style.
5395000	5397000	It's just really cute. Yeah.
5397000	5403000	Well, Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier were both set in the same universe.
5403000	5406000	So let's see. Magical Chase.
5406000	5412000	Why are you trying to autocorrect me to Chase?
5412000	5415000	Why don't you keep reading and I'll look it up real quick?
5415000	5416000	Well, I got it right now.
5416000	5418000	Okay, I don't want the dead air.
5418000	5426000	Anyway, Magical Chase PC Engine, the Japanese version, $229.80.
5426000	5430000	Yeah, okay. Super Rare NEC PC Engine Q card.
5430000	5436000	This is still the Japanese version. $249.00. $199.00.
5436000	5440000	Even the Game Boy Color version is going for $249.00.
5440000	5441000	Dang.
5441000	5442000	This is another Japanese...
5442000	5446000	Okay, we have the soundtrack for $50.00.
5446000	5450000	So yeah, Magical Chase, even the Japanese versions are going for quite a bit of money.
5450000	5452000	The soundtracks are going for money.
5452000	5455000	Basically, anything related to Magical Chase is fetching some money.
5456000	5458000	So, good luck.
5458000	5462000	If someone happens to find me a Magical Chase, give it to me.
5462000	5463000	Alright.
5463000	5467000	But yeah, I'd say if any of you happen to have the game,
5467000	5472000	you've got a celebrity, a small internet celebrity,
5472000	5476000	who would make puppy eyes at you until you give it to her.
5476000	5479000	Or panorama cotton. Those are like on my list.
5479000	5483000	Although, to be honest, if I saw this and then I saw Radiant Silver Gun
5483000	5485000	right next to it to get for Dan,
5485000	5489000	I think that I would do the right thing and get this for myself.
5490000	5492000	Good answer. Very good answer.
5492000	5494000	Actually, I don't think Dan would follow me.
5494000	5495000	Alright.
5495000	5499000	There it is, your classic game of the week, Magical Chase, no relation to cotton.
5499000	5501000	But a small resemblance to Fantasy Zone.
5501000	5503000	But she doesn't go, wheel-o!
5503000	5506000	Alright. Good pick. I knew nothing about this game,
5506000	5508000	and now I'm looking at it going, gosh, I want to play this.
5508000	5510000	Too bad I'll have to emulate it.
5510000	5514000	You can get, it is out there too.
5514000	5517000	Of course it is. Of course it is.
5517000	5520000	And I would not blame a single soul for downloading the game,
5520000	5523000	just saying. In my, allegedly.
5523000	5526000	You know, a game that's this hard to find, that's this old,
5526000	5528000	I mean, who could really fault you for it?
5528000	5530000	If it was on virtual console or something, we'd say go get it.
5530000	5533000	You better believe I have an emulated copy of panorama cotton
5533000	5536000	since they made 600 total in the world, so.
5536000	5539000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week segment.
5539000	5541000	We're gonna take a break. When we come back,
5541000	5543000	plenty of more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5543000	5545000	Xbox rumors, yippee yay.
5545000	5548000	We only have a few more weeks to sit through those.
5548000	5551000	Also talking about some free-to-play stuff on Wii U.
5551000	5553000	Call of Duty, yes. And plenty more.
5553000	5555000	Your calls and the Fugu Question of the Week,
5555000	5557000	all about pinball tonight. Duty.
5557000	5559000	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,
5559000	5562000	right after this.
5562000	5571000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5571000	5575000	Live on this Cinco de Mayo, May 5th, 2013,
5575000	5578000	with episode 503 of our show already in progress.
5578000	5581000	And if you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network,
5581000	5584000	vognetwork.com, you missed some pretty lively debates
5584000	5586000	in the first half of the show, so we hope you will check that out
5586000	5588000	in the podcast feed.
5588000	5591000	I also have to give apologies here at the start of this segment
5591000	5593000	to our friends over at Anime Jam Session.
5593000	5595000	They put on a lovely show, which is on Tuesday nights
5595000	5597000	at the Voice of Geeks Network,
5597000	5599000	and it's 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern,
5599000	5601000	and they rebroadcast Thursday mornings.
5601000	5604000	They sent us a bumper for the 500th episode
5604000	5606000	that I still haven't played,
5606000	5609000	because I was trying to sync it to music a couple weeks ago,
5609000	5611000	and I literally ran out of time because it wasn't working,
5611000	5613000	and I just forgot to do it today.
5613000	5615000	And I've also been procrastinating it because
5615000	5618000	nobody else except Flaco sent us a bumper.
5618000	5620000	So please take a look at the post in our forums
5620000	5622000	and send us more bumpers,
5622000	5624000	and then I'll have reasons to play them all.
5624000	5626000	But I also want to give a shout-out to our pals over there
5626000	5628000	at Anime Jam Session, because
5628000	5630000	I got a lovely package in the mail,
5630000	5632000	a mail package,
5632000	5634000	from Rama this week
5634000	5636000	that sent us some cards.
5636000	5638000	Was it stuffed? Yes, it was stuffed
5638000	5640000	with these Cards Against Humanity boosters
5640000	5642000	from PAX East.
5642000	5644000	So these are going to be pretty hard to come by in California,
5644000	5646000	or many parts of the nation.
5646000	5648000	So, awesome.
5648000	5650000	We kept one or two for ourselves,
5650000	5652000	but we are going to be looking to give away
5652000	5654000	these Pack A and Cs
5654000	5656000	that we got. Sadly no Bs, but hey,
5656000	5658000	you know what? Bakers can't be choosers.
5658000	5660000	So some of these Pack As and Cs we're going to give to you guys,
5660000	5662000	the listeners, in coming weeks of the show.
5662000	5664000	And maybe if there's like a live event
5664000	5666000	coming up, like Fanime or something,
5666000	5668000	I'll take some of these with me to that,
5668000	5670000	and you can win them from me there too.
5670000	5672000	So yeah,
5672000	5674000	thank you very much to our pals over there.
5674000	5676000	I think Brad's first in line now.
5676000	5678000	Wow, what did Brad say?
5678000	5680000	Oh, I sent you guys booze, what else do you want?
5680000	5682000	Yeah, Brad,
5682000	5684000	you make a good case.
5684000	5686000	I guess I should be sending him some Cards Against Humanity
5686000	5688000	cards for sure.
5688000	5690000	We trade goods amongst the Voice
5690000	5692000	of Geeks network shows. The bartering system.
5692000	5694000	Yeah, bartering system. You give me booze,
5694000	5696000	I give you cards.
5696000	5698000	I didn't give Anime Jam Session anything yet,
5698000	5700000	but I will...
5700000	5702000	Rama has my heart.
5702000	5704000	That's what they have.
5704000	5706000	Alright.
5706000	5708000	To register participation for this
5708000	5710000	week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
5710000	5712000	on Vognetwork.com, use the pass
5712000	5714000	phrase, FLAG.
5714000	5716000	Anyhow, let us get back
5716000	5718000	into some gaming news. Rapid Fire
5718000	5720000	news for this Part B. Loki.
5720000	5722000	Borderlands has, well, originally
5722000	5724000	it kind of leaked out from a
5724000	5726000	picture, but it has
5726000	5728000	now been officially announced. Tiny
5728000	5730000	Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep
5730000	5732000	is going to be the next piece of DLC,
5732000	5734000	or I should say the last
5734000	5736000	piece or fourth piece of the game's
5736000	5738000	season pass. Did they make her politically correct yet?
5738000	5740000	No. So it's sort of
5740000	5742000	a play on Dungeons and Dragons
5742000	5744000	and, you know,
5744000	5746000	it'll be interesting. So that's
5746000	5748000	supposed to be coming out June 25th.
5748000	5750000	It will be included in the season
5750000	5752000	pass, so if you have that. Otherwise, it's
5752000	5754000	ten bucks.
5754000	5756000	There's a new game console
5756000	5758000	trailer this week.
5758000	5760000	It's not even really a game console as much
5760000	5762000	as it's more of like an analog
5762000	5764000	video game synthesizer. It's a
5764000	5766000	thing called Ming Meka
5766000	5768000	and it's really
5768000	5770000	strange. I mean, it works just like a synthesizer
5770000	5772000	so it has a lot of analog,
5772000	5774000	you know, physical cords that you're
5774000	5776000	plugging into the stuff and, you know, dials
5776000	5778000	you're tweaking and that sort of thing.
5778000	5780000	And it kind of, it makes
5780000	5782000	music, like a synthesizer, and also
5782000	5784000	kind of does an interactive display.
5784000	5786000	Like, you could do games and
5786000	5788000	stuff sort of on it. Very basic
5788000	5790000	glitchy looking things.
5790000	5792000	I see this more as like
5792000	5794000	something that you would see with like chiptune
5794000	5796000	artists or something like that kind of messing around
5796000	5798000	with, you know, in like a live performance
5798000	5800000	type setting because it
5800000	5802000	seems like that would, you know,
5802000	5804000	play well to it. Plus, it is open
5804000	5806000	source, so you
5806000	5808000	can actually, you know, build one
5808000	5810000	yourself if you want.
5810000	5812000	Or they're going to be selling it. They said they
5812000	5814000	estimate the console is going to be
5814000	5816000	anywhere from, you know,
5816000	5818000	um, you know,
5818000	5820000	was it $350 for the control core
5820000	5822000	or $1,000 for the world core?
5822000	5824000	Because it's a few, I mean,
5824000	5826000	we're talking like it is a synthesizer, so
5826000	5828000	it's kind of in the realm of that.
5828000	5830000	It makes sense price-wise. As a video game
5830000	5832000	console, not so much. But it does get
5832000	5834000	controlled partially within the NES controller, so
5834000	5836000	it looks interesting.
5836000	5838000	Um,
5838000	5840000	and last but not least, the
5840000	5842000	kick-started project, or it was
5842000	5844000	attempted to be kick-started, but it kind of failed.
5844000	5846000	Um, Project Awakened
5846000	5848000	has now, um,
5848000	5850000	put itself on hold, I guess,
5850000	5852000	due to alternate funding
5852000	5854000	options and donors
5854000	5856000	are now receiving refunds. In other words,
5856000	5858000	somebody is picking this thing
5858000	5860000	up and will probably publish it.
5860000	5862000	So, that's kind of cool.
5862000	5864000	Because it looks kind of interesting.
5864000	5866000	One of the first Unreal 4 games
5866000	5868000	that's kind of like a first person,
5868000	5870000	or a third person
5870000	5872000	superhero action
5872000	5874000	game. So, could be neat.
5874000	5876000	Alright.
5876000	5878000	Going over to some news from Level 5.
5878000	5880000	You know Level 5, they made Ni No Kuni,
5880000	5882000	was one of their more recent developing games.
5882000	5884000	Dragon Quest 8, of course, you know, they've done
5884000	5886000	a lot of games. White Knight Chronicles.
5886000	5888000	Well, they have some trademarks
5888000	5890000	out there that have been filed. It's
5890000	5892000	reported that they have filed trademarks for
5892000	5894000	Rare Drop Adventure Note,
5894000	5896000	Earth Devastating
5896000	5898000	B-Rank Girlfriend.
5898000	5900000	That's what it's called.
5900000	5902000	That's an awesome title.
5902000	5904000	And Wonder Flick. That's kind of a neat
5904000	5906000	little sounding thing too. They were all
5906000	5908000	trademarked by the developer all around the same time.
5908000	5910000	Who knows what this could be? These could be three
5910000	5912000	titles in one series. These could all be
5912000	5914000	new games in development.
5914000	5916000	They could be Red Herrings. Who knows? They could be
5916000	5918000	anything. But I hope
5918000	5920000	they all sound like neat
5920000	5922000	titles. So, whatever they are, they're pretty kick-ass.
5922000	5924000	But of course, you know, you can't
5924000	5926000	judge a game based off its title. But these are good
5926000	5928000	starts. But we don't know anything else
5928000	5930000	about these. Maybe E3?
5930000	5932000	Maybe Tokyo Game Show?
5932000	5934000	It sounds like it might be
5934000	5936000	the third Guild
5936000	5938000	game. They always have these
5938000	5940000	weird kind of indie games that are
5940000	5942000	a prize of that. So, maybe
5942000	5944000	these are titles in that.
5944000	5946000	Okay, that's a good theory.
5946000	5948000	Also, Nintendo apparently
5948000	5950000	going to be introducing Retro Studio's new
5950000	5952000	project in the not-so-distant
5952000	5954000	future. Could this be
5954000	5956000	E3 or a Nintendo Direct?
5956000	5958000	Who knows? But
5958000	5960000	Hiro Yamada said, quote,
5960000	5962000	I wonder what kind of game it is. I hope
5962000	5964000	to introduce it to you in the not-so-distant
5964000	5966000	future.
5966000	5968000	Interesting. That's in an
5968000	5970000	interview with Official Nintendo.
5970000	5972000	Well, what? Official Nintendo Magazine. Must be over in
5972000	5974000	Japan because they don't have one here anymore.
5974000	5976000	So, I'll tell you what it should be.
5976000	5978000	What? It should be
5978000	5980000	a new Excite Shark game.
5980000	5982000	It's the UK Official Nintendo Magazine.
5982000	5984000	It should be a new Excite Shark game. Is that what you want Retro Studios
5984000	5986000	to be working on? That would sell me a system.
5986000	5988000	A new Excite Truck game. That's good.
5988000	5990000	I'm not talking fucking
5990000	5992000	Excitebots trick racing.
5992000	5994000	Because that was absolute shit.
5994000	5996000	I will be tickled pink if
5996000	5998000	it's a new Metroid or a new F-Zero.
5998000	6000000	Especially a new F-Zero.
6000000	6002000	That would be pretty cool. I mean, at least that's a
6002000	6004000	racing game, Loki. You gotta get excited about that a little bit.
6004000	6006000	Come on. HD.
6006000	6008000	Super fast. Alright. Anyhow.
6008000	6010000	Also, this may or may not be
6010000	6012000	something up Dark Sakura's alley. I don't know if she's really
6012000	6014000	into this series anymore. I don't have any alleys.
6014000	6016000	The Sims 4.
6016000	6018000	Oh, you're not so much a Sims
6018000	6020000	girl anymore? If it
6020000	6022000	manages memory better and lets me get in more
6022000	6024000	fun mods, then
6024000	6026000	yeah, but Sims 3 played like shit.
6026000	6028000	Well, Sims
6028000	6030000	Is it online only? Well,
6030000	6032000	the rumor is, yes it is.
6032000	6034000	But what, I mean, of course
6034000	6036000	that rumor's gonna be out there after what happened with
6036000	6038000	SimCity. It will be very interesting to see how
6038000	6040000	what happened with SimCity plays into this.
6040000	6042000	Regardless, we all know it's gotta happen
6042000	6044000	eventually, but it looks like it's something that could be
6044000	6046000	happening relatively soon. They are
6046000	6048000	saying this could actually be announced tomorrow,
6048000	6050000	May 6th. So by the time many of you hear
6050000	6052000	this podcast, it could have been announced.
6052000	6054000	This is due to a web domain
6054000	6056000	registration, apparently by EA.
6056000	6058000	Which I would have thought you would grab the Sims 4
6058000	6060000	name a hell of a long time ago. Whatever.
6060000	6062000	The studio is holding a conference
6062000	6064000	call tomorrow. Supposed to be making a
6064000	6066000	major announcement. So what the hell else would it be?
6066000	6068000	Except maybe five more Sims 3 expansions!
6068000	6070000	Yes!
6070000	6072000	They have about that, Maynie.
6072000	6074000	You wanna know what's really sad?
6074000	6076000	Is that with Sims 3, the
6076000	6078000	stuff that the mod community's been doing
6078000	6080000	is worlds better
6080000	6082000	than any of the official stuff
6082000	6084000	that EA put out. I mean, even
6084000	6086000	down to custom furniture,
6086000	6088000	everything, the fan community has just been
6088000	6090000	perfect, and I would love for
6090000	6092000	it would actually, I would buy it
6092000	6094000	if they would hire some of the
6094000	6096000	mod people. The people who have done mods. Well, they're not Valve.
6096000	6098000	I know, but I'm saying
6098000	6100000	that would sell it for me right there, is
6100000	6102000	certain people in the
6102000	6104000	custom community. You don't want to be always
6104000	6106000	connected? No!
6106000	6108000	I hate people.
6108000	6110000	Because Sims
6110000	6112000	because Sims Online
6112000	6114000	Sims Online worked so well.
6114000	6116000	Rob. And also the Sims Social worked so
6116000	6118000	well that they're totally closing
6118000	6120000	that game. Actually, Sims Social was, everybody
6120000	6122000	was fucking playing that. I played Sims
6122000	6124000	Social. That came and went.
6124000	6126000	Like, I kind of wish Candy Crush Saga would
6126000	6128000	I finally blocked it this week, y'all. I couldn't
6128000	6130000	anymore with Candy Crush. I couldn't. And then
6130000	6132000	what happens last night, I'm lying in bed
6132000	6134000	and I hear this very familiar song and I'm like
6134000	6136000	what are you doing over there on your phone, Alan?
6136000	6138000	I'm stuck on level 29
6138000	6140000	in Candy Crush Saga. No!
6140000	6142000	You can't
6142000	6144000	escape. For the record, I don't hate
6144000	6146000	people, just most people.
6146000	6148000	You love
6148000	6150000	all our listeners, right? Yeah.
6150000	6152000	Okay, good.
6152000	6154000	Yeah, I love you guys.
6154000	6156000	No, seriously.
6156000	6158000	I love you guys. Seriously. Seriously.
6158000	6160000	Love you, mean it. Seriously. Alright, Dark
6160000	6162000	Soccer, what do you got for us? I am not
6162000	6164000	Grumpy Cat.
6164000	6166000	I'm not Grumpy Cat. I'm
6166000	6168000	Disgruntled Cat.
6168000	6170000	Anyway, Square
6170000	6172000	Enix is remastering
6172000	6174000	soundtracks from Final Fantasy games.
6174000	6176000	We will be seeing the Final Fantasy
6176000	6178000	4 one released
6178000	6180000	on, looks like July 3rd
6180000	6182000	this year.
6182000	6184000	That's the first one they're starting
6184000	6186000	with and they're going to have box art done
6186000	6188000	especially by
6188000	6190000	Yoshitaka Amano
6190000	6192000	and then
6192000	6194000	of course we're probably not going to see it in
6194000	6196000	the US, but
6196000	6198000	Square Enix does do digital releases
6198000	6200000	for a lot of their albums so we might see it on iTunes.
6200000	6202000	iTunes. Of course,
6202000	6204000	you know, if you actually want a physical CD so that
6204000	6206000	you can get the awesome artwork, there's always CD
6206000	6208000	from Japan.
6208000	6210000	Also,
6210000	6212000	Break Man, I am not hating your faces.
6212000	6214000	Okay, I don't hate anyone's
6214000	6216000	faces.
6216000	6218000	Also, we have
6218000	6220000	a notice that there is
6220000	6222000	a DVD out called 100 yen
6222000	6224000	the Japanese Arcade Experience
6224000	6226000	which is a
6226000	6228000	documentary about
6228000	6230000	arcade culture in Japan.
6230000	6232000	There's a trailer for it out if you're
6232000	6234000	interested in looking at it, but
6234000	6236000	not only does it talk about
6236000	6238000	just gaming, arcade
6238000	6240000	gaming in Japan, it does talk about the US
6240000	6242000	and Canada as well, and the
6242000	6244000	casual gamers.
6244000	6246000	So,
6246000	6248000	and last but not least,
6248000	6250000	for people who are pinball
6250000	6252000	fans, like me,
6252000	6254000	Pinball FX 2 is coming
6254000	6256000	to Steam. The game
6256000	6258000	itself will be free, but the tables will be
6258000	6260000	10 bucks a pop. 6 pounds
6260000	6262000	for our British listeners.
6262000	6264000	And that's including Star Wars
6264000	6266000	Pinball, Marvel Pinball, Marvel Pinball
6266000	6268000	Legends of Virtue, Marvel Pinball
6268000	6270000	Avengers Chronicles, Pinball FX
6270000	6272000	2 Core Collection, and
6272000	6274000	Zen Classics.
6274000	6276000	I had a
6276000	6278000	pretty good time playing it. It sort of gave
6278000	6280000	me some of the feel of
6280000	6282000	pinmame, but
6282000	6284000	not
6284000	6286000	quite. They're
6286000	6288000	all original stuff, so it was pretty neat.
6288000	6290000	That's cool. Yeah.
6290000	6292000	Alright, so let's move
6292000	6294000	on a little bit to some
6294000	6296000	actual, I
6296000	6298000	don't know,
6298000	6300000	Xbox rumors, if you will.
6300000	6302000	This week,
6302000	6304000	it was made known that
6304000	6306000	Microsoft has registered
6306000	6308000	the domain for Xbox
6308000	6310000	Fusion, and
6310000	6312000	also
6312000	6314000	some other stuff related to XboxFusion.de,
6314000	6316000	XboxFusion.co.uk,
6316000	6318000	XboxFusion.biz.
6318000	6320000	So,
6320000	6322000	one would think, hey,
6322000	6324000	you know, Xbox Fusion, that could be
6324000	6326000	a name of a console, maybe.
6326000	6328000	Maybe.
6328000	6330000	So,
6330000	6332000	good chances are that
6332000	6334000	might be actually what they're gonna finally call the
6334000	6336000	console.
6336000	6338000	Maybe a little bit better than
6338000	6340000	Xbox Lube, I don't know, I mean.
6340000	6342000	Unless they're having a
6342000	6344000	service called Fusion.
6344000	6346000	That's true, I guess they could have that
6346000	6348000	as well, but
6348000	6350000	at least there is something that's gonna be
6350000	6352000	kind of relating
6352000	6354000	to the Xbox that's gonna be named Fusion,
6354000	6356000	so we'll see if it's actually the console, or
6356000	6358000	it's not a bad name for a console, I guess.
6358000	6360000	It could work. It just
6360000	6362000	seems like they arbitrarily picked a name out of their
6362000	6364000	asses. Fusion sounds cool,
6364000	6366000	let's call it that.
6366000	6368000	Then also, there is
6368000	6370000	a rumor that the next,
6370000	6372000	or the first,
6372000	6374000	I guess, debut game of
6374000	6376000	Respawn Entertainment is gonna
6376000	6378000	actually be this game
6378000	6380000	called Titan, and
6380000	6382000	some information has kind of
6382000	6384000	leaked out about it already,
6384000	6386000	saying that the game
6386000	6388000	is gonna revolve around
6388000	6390000	these giant mechs,
6390000	6392000	called Titans, and so it's kind of a
6392000	6394000	multiplayer shooter game, but
6394000	6396000	then it's also gonna have these giant mechs as well,
6396000	6398000	kind of think it's a little bit like MechWarrior,
6398000	6400000	but maybe more of the
6400000	6402000	scale of, it kind of reminds me of
6402000	6404000	Command & Conquer Generals, and
6404000	6406000	MechWarrior.
6406000	6408000	The Titan thing is really funny, because Blizzard
6408000	6410000	has that Project Titan thing right now.
6410000	6412000	We all know that's not the real name of the game,
6412000	6414000	but it's just funny that
6414000	6416000	there is a game called Titan, maybe.
6416000	6418000	And then,
6418000	6420000	what else?
6420000	6422000	And apparently,
6422000	6424000	this might be exclusive to the next
6424000	6426000	platform. I'm assuming it's gonna be exclusive
6426000	6428000	for a limited amount of time. I don't know if it's gonna be
6428000	6430000	exclusive forever, but probably at launch.
6430000	6432000	And Microsoft's had a few deals like this
6432000	6434000	with the DLC, Windows, and all that.
6434000	6436000	Skyrim, right, had that?
6436000	6438000	Yeah, Skyrim
6438000	6440000	did. Call of Duty does,
6440000	6442000	and did.
6442000	6444000	Grand Theft Auto did.
6444000	6446000	Ah, yeah.
6446000	6448000	There's been a lot.
6448000	6450000	And then,
6450000	6452000	of course,
6452000	6454000	Illumaroom had a new trailer this week,
6454000	6456000	and for those who don't remember,
6456000	6458000	Illumaroom is this brand new
6458000	6460000	peripheral that's gonna tie in with the
6460000	6462000	Xbox 360, or the new Xbox,
6462000	6464000	and perhaps PCs
6464000	6466000	as well, to kind of
6466000	6468000	extend the play field
6468000	6470000	for your games. And the way it's being
6470000	6472000	done, they actually showed the device this time, so
6472000	6474000	we don't have to imagine what it looks like.
6474000	6476000	It's all very prototype right
6476000	6478000	now, but right now,
6478000	6480000	it's basically a projector
6480000	6482000	attached to a Kinect sensor,
6482000	6484000	and the Kinect sensor scans the room,
6484000	6486000	and so it actually will,
6486000	6488000	you can use it for
6488000	6490000	special effects, you can use it to
6490000	6492000	increase, you know, your
6492000	6494000	field of view, you can also
6494000	6496000	use it for, like,
6496000	6498000	indicators and
6498000	6500000	stuff in the game,
6500000	6502000	and the way it does everything, it actually
6502000	6504000	projects stuff in there and will manipulate,
6504000	6506000	like, you can actually have, like, a ripple
6506000	6508000	effect come out of the screen, and
6508000	6510000	it just looks really cool. But
6510000	6512000	this is something that you
6512000	6514000	were really only gonna see, I guess, a public demo
6514000	6516000	of it as early
6516000	6518000	as July is when they're gonna
6518000	6520000	publicly demo this, and it's not expected
6520000	6522000	to be something that the system launches with if it
6522000	6524000	does eventually. Which might have bummed out some people
6524000	6526000	that were kind of looking forward to something like that.
6526000	6528000	The concept looked really cool.
6528000	6530000	I would be worried that if they launched this
6530000	6532000	with the console, which, don't get me wrong, I think
6532000	6534000	if they could get it in the console and have
6534000	6536000	the price of it be cheap enough,
6536000	6538000	because adding a projector,
6538000	6540000	an HD projector, and
6540000	6542000	another Kinect sensor. Yeah, but what if it's
6542000	6544000	not, like, the images itself,
6544000	6546000	if it's just, like, colored lights and things
6546000	6548000	like that that enhance the- But it's actually,
6548000	6550000	it's a project- I mean, it looks neat.
6550000	6552000	I mean, it looked neat. Maybe that's what they're still trying to figure
6552000	6554000	out, is the- The problem is, though, is
6554000	6556000	they envision it as, like, a projector
6556000	6558000	that sits on a coffee table. So once again,
6558000	6560000	you're talking
6560000	6562000	Kinect sensor- I don't got a coffee table!
6562000	6564000	That's for rich people! Exactly. I don't have a coffee
6564000	6566000	table, I don't have this, you know,
6566000	6568000	you're limiting it now to
6568000	6570000	okay, it's gonna have this, this thing
6570000	6572000	that's gonna sit on a coffee table. Well, hey, hold on a second.
6572000	6574000	If I have to have a coffee
6574000	6576000	table in my room, this projector's gonna sit- Where do I play
6576000	6578000	Kinect? Exactly, exactly.
6578000	6580000	But you're telling me to move the coffee table out of the
6580000	6582000	way to play the Kinect games? I'm confused!
6582000	6584000	I am not rearranging the goddamn furniture
6584000	6586000	to play Xbox. What do you want me to do with this coffee
6586000	6588000	table? Microsoft
6588000	6590000	unveils the easily movable coffee
6590000	6592000	table. It moves out! It moves back in!
6592000	6594000	It put sensors on it, it put
6594000	6596000	coffee on it! It's great. The Microsoft
6596000	6598000	transformer coffee table, wah wah wah.
6598000	6600000	It's coming to you from IKEA!
6600000	6602000	That would mean you'd
6602000	6604000	have to build it yourself, and it would have a name
6604000	6606000	like Sfarce
6606000	6608000	Gardevan. Or Billy.
6608000	6610000	Well, that's the bookcase, sorry.
6610000	6612000	Alright. There you go, Xbox
6612000	6614000	Fusion is the new coffee table.
6614000	6616000	This system
6616000	6618000	is the coffee table.
6618000	6620000	It fuses to your coffee table. It is the
6620000	6622000	coffee table. It becomes one with
6622000	6624000	the coffee table. It hopefully has nothing to do with
6624000	6626000	Fusion Frenzy. Let's
6626000	6628000	pray, please. That has nothing to do with
6628000	6630000	Fusion Frenzy. Or what if, what if
6630000	6632000	or we could see the headlines now.
6632000	6634000	There's a frenzy for the new Xbox
6634000	6636000	Fusion. It's a Fusion Frenzy!
6636000	6638000	Break! Ahhhh!
6638000	6640000	Break Man in our chatroom at live.hug
6640000	6642000	at live.hugnetwork.com says
6642000	6644000	Xbox needs to move the coffee table
6644000	6646000	its damn self.
6646000	6648000	That's really hilarious. Setting up
6648000	6650000	room for Kinect.
6650000	6652000	It just
6652000	6654000	knocks over your coffee table.
6654000	6656000	It disappears into the floor
6656000	6658000	with everything that was left on it.
6658000	6660000	Pushes the cat out of the way.
6660000	6662000	Meow!
6662000	6664000	With Xbox Fusion's new
6664000	6666000	telekinetic abilities
6666000	6668000	it can move your furniture for you.
6668000	6670000	Arrange in room for Kinect.
6672000	6674000	That would be hilarious. I want one of those giant
6674000	6676000	holes that opens up in the ground to drop
6676000	6678000	people I don't like out of sight forever. Creating the
6678000	6680000	high wall. Couch moves in the place.
6680000	6682000	Alright, now we're getting
6682000	6684000	stupid. Let's get to the foogle question
6684000	6686000	of the week.
6692000	6694000	Facebook, Google Plus.
6694000	6696000	Slam them together, you get foogle.
6696000	6698000	It's the foogle question of the week. Every week
6698000	6700000	we ask a question of our fan communities and read
6700000	6702000	some of our favorite answers here on the show.
6702000	6704000	Again, like last week, way
6704000	6706000	too many answers. I can only read
6706000	6708000	some of them tonight. I'm sorry guys. Let's start
6708000	6710000	on Google Plus with the
6710000	6712000	answer to the question about pinball.
6712000	6714000	DarkSakura likes to talk about
6714000	6716000	pinball a lot on the show.
6716000	6718000	A lot you guys. She talks about it
6718000	6720000	a lot. She's talked about it five minutes ago.
6720000	6722000	We played pinball last night.
6722000	6724000	Also in the news this week we are hearing
6724000	6726000	that pinball FX2 is coming to steam as she
6726000	6728000	mentioned a minute ago. What do you think about
6728000	6730000	pinball? Are there some pinball tables that you
6730000	6732000	can't pass up playing when you see them?
6732000	6734000	How about pinball video games? Are there any favorites
6734000	6736000	that you have or will you only play the
6736000	6738000	real thing? Let's go to Google Plus with some of the answers
6738000	6740000	here. IceP on
6740000	6742000	Google Plus. I love
6742000	6744000	that name. I think my favorite
6744000	6746000	simulators were Pinball Dreams, Pinball
6746000	6748000	Fantasies, and Slam Tilt on the
6748000	6750000	Amiga. You just
6750000	6752000	the very first thing a listener named was my
6752000	6754000	absolute favorite. Pinball Dreams was on the
6754000	6756000	PC as well. I know it was more known as an Amiga
6756000	6758000	game. I think it was amazing and Pinball Fantasies
6758000	6760000	was great too. I'm sorry
6760000	6762000	I just had one of those random thoughts. What?
6762000	6764000	There's a Commodore 64 set that works for
6764000	6766000	iCade. Just letting you know.
6766000	6768000	Oh, the emulator thingy? I have
6768000	6770000	that.
6770000	6772000	Stoked. Anyway, back to pinball.
6772000	6774000	How can you of all people
6774000	6776000	change the topic away from pinball?
6776000	6778000	Shame on you. Now we're talking about
6778000	6780000	Dragon Crush?
6780000	6782000	Going back to IceP.
6782000	6784000	I love the fact that these weren't real
6784000	6786000	tables. The way no one could
6786000	6788000	unfavorably compare them to the real thing.
6788000	6790000	Plus it allowed them the freedom to let their
6790000	6792000	imagination run wild.
6792000	6794000	Panaxium says, I remember my first pinball
6794000	6796000	game was Moraff's Pinball back on the
6796000	6798000	386. I was too young
6798000	6800000	to understand how awful of a game that was.
6800000	6802000	Later I got hooked on Epic Pinball
6802000	6804000	and that was a blast. However, I don't think
6804000	6806000	I ever had the chance to play a real pinball table.
6806000	6808000	Really?
6808000	6810000	You never played a real pinball table?
6810000	6812000	I guess maybe that's one of those things I take for granted.
6812000	6814000	Bars. I mean, maybe you're not
6814000	6816000	a bar person, but a lot of bars have them.
6816000	6818000	Have pinball tables.
6818000	6820000	Bowling alleys? I don't know if that's a thing.
6820000	6822000	Movie theaters.
6822000	6824000	And John's Incredibly
6824000	6826000	Crappy Pizza. You need to go find a pinball
6826000	6828000	table, son. Alright, Travis
6828000	6830000	H. on Google Plus says, I love
6830000	6832000	pinball. Used to play the Addams Family table
6832000	6834000	until my quarters ran dry at a rec center
6834000	6836000	here in Florida. Also love the Indiana
6836000	6838000	Jones table. I play a lot of Zen pinball
6838000	6840000	on my Vita. Collecting the tables
6840000	6842000	and going back and forth with friends trying
6842000	6844000	to top scores. Great game.
6844000	6846000	Remember Prop Cycle Addams Family?
6846000	6848000	Yes!
6848000	6850000	Wasn't that at California Extreme or something?
6850000	6852000	I need to figure out when that is this year.
6852000	6854000	Pinagogo's coming up in a couple months too, by the way.
6854000	6856000	Is it really? Yeah. I need to get these things on the calendar.
6856000	6858000	I just, isn't
6858000	6860000	We're taking our jackpot. Isn't California Extreme
6860000	6862000	almost always the last weekend in July because
6862000	6864000	I bet you it's the same frickin' day as Clue.
6864000	6866000	I bet you anything. Uh, that might be.
6866000	6868000	But I know that for, well, Pinagogo's
6868000	6870000	the one in Dixon, and we're taking
6870000	6872000	jackpot there because
6872000	6874000	the creator of jackpot in a bunch
6874000	6876000	of the series is gonna be at
6876000	6878000	Pinagogo this year.
6878000	6880000	No, it's July 13th to 14th this year.
6880000	6882000	I'll be in rehearsals that weekend,
6882000	6884000	but maybe I can go on Sunday
6884000	6886000	at least. We should still make it happen.
6886000	6888000	I know, I should. It'll be fun.
6888000	6890000	Anyhow, where were we?
6890000	6892000	We're going to Facebook. Those are some of the answers
6892000	6894000	from Google+. Please check out our community on Google+.
6894000	6896000	to read them all. And I'm gonna read
6896000	6898000	some of the answers here on Facebook as well.
6898000	6900000	Andy R. says
6900000	6902000	I still don't quite get pinball.
6902000	6904000	It's fun to play, but I have
6904000	6906000	no clue how to score well in it, and I always
6906000	6908000	suck. I'm the guy that loses the ball
6908000	6910000	in the first 10 seconds and gets saved by
6910000	6912000	the noobsaver feature. I bought
6912000	6914000	Pinball Arcade on PS3 Vita
6914000	6916000	recently after kickstarting the Star Trek
6916000	6918000	table. It's pretty fun, even if my scores
6918000	6920000	are abysmal, and it's a good distraction
6920000	6922000	if I've got my Vita on me and I need to kill some time
6922000	6924000	while I'm out. Any tips for Andy?
6924000	6926000	There's actually
6926000	6928000	a series of DVDs out.
6928000	6930000	We've got a few of them, but a lot of them
6930000	6932000	have been put on YouTube.
6932000	6934000	It actually teaches you a little bit of the physics
6934000	6936000	involved with a well-balanced pinball table.
6936000	6938000	A lot of it is learning how to
6938000	6940000	catch the ball with your flippers
6940000	6942000	and learning where your
6942000	6944000	triggers are, because pretty much it's
6944000	6946000	really just a game of physics.
6946000	6948000	Here's the
6948000	6950000	most common mistake new players make
6950000	6952000	is that they hit both flippers at the same time.
6952000	6954000	Don't ever do that.
6954000	6956000	The only time that might work
6956000	6958000	is multi-ball, when it just so happens
6958000	6960000	to be timed that way. But you've got to get yourself
6960000	6962000	out of the habit of hitting both flippers at the same
6962000	6964000	time, and if you can do that, that's the first step.
6964000	6966000	And if you are just trying to keep from draining,
6966000	6968000	keep your eye on the flippers.
6968000	6970000	When you see that ball
6970000	6972000	coming to your field of vision, hit whatever
6972000	6974000	flipper it's going towards. Now I want to play some pinball.
6974000	6976000	Come to my house.
6976000	6978000	Come to my house! Jeremy J,
6978000	6980000	my buddy from Koopa Club,
6980000	6982000	I want to give a shout out to that podcast. They're a
6982000	6984000	fun little bunch. They just had a drunkie episode
6984000	6986000	not that long ago either. Those are fun.
6986000	6988000	So, looking forward to meeting him in
6988000	6990000	August when they come out here for Gamer X.
6990000	6992000	But anyway, Jeremy J says,
6992000	6994000	I'm dreadful at pinball in every form,
6994000	6996000	whether it's on an actual table or a digital
6996000	6998000	version. That doesn't stop me from really
6998000	7000000	enjoying it though. I sunk 10 plus hours
7000000	7002000	into Zen Pinball 2 and didn't even realize it.
7002000	7004000	In terms of tables I wouldn't pass
7004000	7006000	up. Anything horror related
7006000	7008000	would have to get at least one go from me.
7008000	7010000	Twilight Zone, Creature from the Black
7010000	7012000	Girl Goon, etc. Creature is awesome.
7012000	7014000	You used to have that one. We did.
7014000	7016000	Gaming Nerd says,
7016000	7018000	real pinball is the way to go. While some
7018000	7020000	pinball video games like Zen Pinball keep the idea
7020000	7022000	alive without having to build an actual table
7022000	7024000	from the ground up, it just doesn't feel the same
7024000	7026000	as playing on real tables. With a real
7026000	7028000	pinball table, the physics with the ball and the
7028000	7030000	angle of the table are as real as it gets.
7030000	7032000	Video game pinball is emulated realism
7032000	7034000	and can still run the risk of a bug
7034000	7036000	in the physics engine used to simulate
7036000	7038000	the ball's movement and hit detection against
7038000	7040000	the bumpers, flippers, etc.
7040000	7042000	Plus, who doesn't love a machine full of
7042000	7044000	flashing lights and that deafening loud knocker
7044000	7046000	when you earn a free game? Not
7046000	7048000	going to disagree with you, Gaming Nerd, but
7048000	7050000	the real machines can be full of bugs, too.
7050000	7052000	The ball's getting stuck,
7052000	7054000	magnets not working.
7054000	7056000	For example, we have a problem with our Twilight Zone
7056000	7058000	right now, where if it doesn't warm up properly,
7058000	7060000	the game will reset itself halfway through
7060000	7062000	the first ball. We
7062000	7064000	had to, actually for
7064000	7066000	pinball tables, for them to work properly, they have to be
7066000	7068000	very well calibrated. They have to be balanced.
7068000	7070000	They have to, you have to
7070000	7072000	make sure that your contacts are clean. You have to make sure
7072000	7074000	the balls are clean.
7074000	7076000	Do you always make sure
7076000	7078000	the balls are clean, Dark Sakura?
7078000	7080000	Well, we had a mention of
7080000	7082000	Twilight Zone earlier. With Twilight Zone,
7082000	7084000	they also use
7084000	7086000	ceramic balls.
7086000	7088000	For Powerball,
7088000	7090000	shut up.
7090000	7092000	You guys should see the look on Rob's face.
7092000	7094000	It's maybe a little
7094000	7096000	troll face. Do you shine
7096000	7098000	the balls yourself?
7098000	7100000	You know what? Bite me.
7100000	7102000	Another thing, too, tables are
7102000	7104000	actually waxed, especially if they're
7104000	7106000	wood
7106000	7108000	surface tables. There's a lot
7108000	7110000	that has to be done. Even the type of leg that
7110000	7112000	you use, because we have those nice brass ones
7112000	7114000	on the World Cup. Sometimes even the
7114000	7116000	leg you use on it, but so much goes into
7116000	7118000	the balance of the game. You have so many different
7118000	7120000	components to make sure it works.
7120000	7122000	Upkeep of
7122000	7124000	a physical table
7124000	7126000	is going to make or break you playing the game.
7126000	7128000	So, would you say that after
7128000	7130000	extended play on a wax table, that the balls would
7130000	7132000	eventually become waxed as well?
7136000	7138000	Breakman in chat says, my balls need a good
7138000	7140000	shining. You can shine your own damn balls.
7144000	7146000	Well, maybe after the show, he should just go do that.
7146000	7148000	I don't want to know about it.
7148000	7150000	It's just pinball. Alright,
7150000	7152000	VX JasonXV
7152000	7154000	in chat asks a real question here.
7154000	7156000	What is the reason for the free game
7156000	7158000	knocker? That's a good question. Why is that fucking
7158000	7160000	so loud when you win a free game? Is that just to
7160000	7162000	draw attention in the arcade? Tradition.
7162000	7164000	Oh, tradition? I don't know. I think maybe
7164000	7166000	actually, my thought of it being so loud
7166000	7168000	is that, this is my own theory,
7168000	7170000	is that it's so loud in an arcade
7170000	7172000	that they want to draw attention
7172000	7174000	to that you won one. That's what I figured.
7174000	7176000	However, we were
7176000	7178000	I was playing jackpot last, actually
7178000	7180000	Deanna who
7180000	7182000	was one of our DDR friends. Hi, Deanna.
7182000	7184000	Does she listen to the show? Probably not.
7184000	7186000	She's at a baseball game tonight
7186000	7188000	in Fresno. Okay. It's like, you're going to Fresno?
7188000	7190000	Well, with all those long flights
7190000	7192000	to Japan, you would think she listens to some podcasts.
7192000	7194000	Yeah. Well, at any
7194000	7196000	rate, she was
7196000	7198000	playing World Cup, Dan was playing
7198000	7200000	Twilight, and I was playing jackpot. Those are the only three we have
7200000	7202000	left. And then Dan got
7202000	7204000	an extra ball because he was really good at
7204000	7206000	Twilight Zone. And I swear, I
7206000	7208000	tilted the machine, or
7208000	7210000	almost tilted the machine just because I
7210000	7212000	wasn't expecting it. It was so loud.
7212000	7214000	That's something that new pinball players should know about
7214000	7216000	too, is that tilting the machine
7216000	7218000	is okay. It's
7218000	7220000	about finding the right balance. You can't
7220000	7222000	slam the thing too much, but a little
7222000	7224000	smack, you just got to slap it on the ass
7224000	7226000	a little bit to get those
7226000	7228000	balls right where you got to get them.
7228000	7230000	The sweet spot for most tables is going to
7230000	7232000	be right past the flipper. Yeah, tell us
7232000	7234000	about that sweet spot. Shut up.
7234000	7236000	And you use the palm of your
7236000	7238000	bottom of your palm. You know what? Bye.
7240000	7242000	And she's left.
7244000	7246000	I can't help it.
7246000	7248000	You're talking about the sweet spot.
7250000	7252000	How about the listeners? Back to the
7252000	7254000	listeners on Facebook.
7254000	7256000	Burr says, my favorite
7256000	7258000	pinball game of all time is pinball
7258000	7260000	construction set. I loved making my
7260000	7262000	own pinball tables on my Apple 2.
7262000	7264000	Where the hell is the Kickstarter for a remake?
7264000	7266000	I hear ya, except
7266000	7268000	replace Apple 2 with Commodore 64
7268000	7270000	and that was me. That game was awesome.
7270000	7272000	Like a Sega game too, where you can make
7272000	7274000	a Genesis game that you can make pinball
7274000	7276000	tables. They did, didn't they? I don't remember
7276000	7278000	what it was called, but I remember at the back of the box there they had one
7278000	7280000	that was like one bumper and
7280000	7282000	all the flippers you could possibly fit on
7282000	7284000	the screen. All flippers.
7284000	7286000	That was all it was. Fabrice
7286000	7288000	A says, sadly, pinball machines
7288000	7290000	have become even more rare than arcade
7290000	7292000	cabinets. I do enjoy pinball a lot.
7292000	7294000	Once you know how to score big,
7294000	7296000	it's super addictive. I've played my fair share
7296000	7298000	of pinball tables. Independence Day, High Roller,
7298000	7300000	The Simpsons, Roller Coaster Tycoon,
7300000	7302000	Lord of the Rings, and the list goes on. The one I enjoyed
7302000	7304000	the most was The Addams Family.
7304000	7306000	Very intricate.
7306000	7308000	Now Jamie, do they have a good Game of Thrones
7308000	7310000	table? Cause I would imagine that, you know,
7310000	7312000	that'd be pretty popular. If it's gonna
7312000	7314000	come out, there would be Stern making it.
7314000	7316000	But Stern, I think,
7316000	7318000	has a...
7318000	7320000	What was the last one that Stern did? Was it
7320000	7322000	Tron Legacy? I'm gonna have to check now.
7322000	7324000	They actually have
7324000	7326000	a deluxe one that has all the neon lights
7326000	7328000	and everything around it too.
7328000	7330000	Shattered Hawk says, the girlfriend
7330000	7332000	and I go to the Nickel Cade about once
7332000	7334000	or twice a month. We spend most of the time
7334000	7336000	playing the Star Trek and Addams Family
7336000	7338000	pinball games. And lastly,
7338000	7340000	Edgar R says, I love pinball. I never
7340000	7342000	passed up The Simpsons at my old local pub.
7342000	7344000	Again, those are just some of the answers from
7344000	7346000	Facebook and Google+. Sorry, I didn't have time to read
7346000	7348000	them all. And tonight, I kind of picked people
7348000	7350000	that don't usually get in chat and I don't
7350000	7352000	usually hear from on the show in other ways.
7352000	7354000	Trying to spread the love around a little bit. So,
7354000	7356000	I do encourage all our listeners though to read the
7356000	7358000	complete list of answers at Facebook.com.
7358000	7360000	Metallica pinball is the last one.
7360000	7362000	They have a Metallica pinball?
7362000	7364000	They're gonna fuck that up just like they did
7364000	7366000	Guitar Hero. I think they also did a Kiss pinball as well.
7366000	7368000	Hold on. No, that's cool.
7368000	7370000	Alright.
7370000	7372000	Let's get back into some other news.
7372000	7374000	Oh, I guess it's my turn for other news too.
7374000	7376000	Nintendo possibly
7376000	7378000	going into more free to play software.
7378000	7380000	I want to say we heard this rumor before.
7380000	7382000	But this is about something that happened
7382000	7384000	with Satoru Iwata and I
7384000	7386000	think it was in an interview
7386000	7388000	that was actually on Nintendo.co.jp
7388000	7390000	The company is looking beyond
7390000	7392000	digital distribution and is thinking about free to
7392000	7394000	play games. Question.
7394000	7396000	You talked about Nintendo's digital
7396000	7398000	business in the presentation. I remember you said
7398000	7400000	that in addition to the package software business
7400000	7402000	the digital business could be a core business
7402000	7404000	for Nintendo. Could you please give an indication
7404000	7406000	as to how much you expect to generate in
7406000	7408000	digital sales this fiscal year and the next?
7408000	7410000	Also, apart from replacing package
7410000	7412000	distribution with digital distribution
7412000	7414000	I understand that you are developing network based
7414000	7416000	products such as Wii Street U powered
7416000	7418000	by Google. Do you expect to be able to
7418000	7420000	make hit network based products and create a buzz
7420000	7422000	in society? Here's the answer.
7422000	7424000	Also, as you pointed out, we think
7424000	7426000	the digital distribution of package software
7426000	7428000	is only the first step in expanding our digital
7428000	7430000	business. We will not simply
7430000	7432000	change our existing package software
7432000	7434000	distribution channel. Rather, we might
7434000	7436000	have many other types of business models
7436000	7438000	in addition to package software.
7438000	7440000	For example, we might see more games
7440000	7442000	that are similar to free to play games,
7442000	7444000	games that cost much less, or games
7444000	7446000	that require a monthly subscription fee.
7446000	7448000	That would be uncharted territory for
7448000	7450000	Nintendo. Digitalization allows
7450000	7452000	for greater flexibility whereby having
7452000	7454000	more ways to make payments, both software
7454000	7456000	developers and consumers have more options.
7456000	7458000	And Nintendo 3DS and Wii U
7458000	7460000	have flexible systems to handle such
7460000	7462000	treads, so it is now a question of
7462000	7464000	putting these ideas into action. I
7464000	7466000	can definitely say that Nintendo will make
7466000	7468000	new offers that go well beyond
7468000	7470000	simply replacing package software
7470000	7472000	with digital software.
7474000	7476000	Now that doesn't necessarily mean
7476000	7478000	free to play, but certainly they are looking
7478000	7480000	at mixing things up a little bit and not just
7480000	7482000	being digital versions of the same
7482000	7484000	stuff. I think Jamie's
7484000	7486000	next story ties into this a little bit as well,
7486000	7488000	so I'll let her go next and we'll come back to this.
7488000	7490000	Although I do
7490000	7492000	want to say, I will say real quick, I
7492000	7494000	played that Wii Street U by Google. I was
7494000	7496000	messing around with that on the Wii U a little bit this week.
7496000	7498000	I had no idea that
7498000	7500000	on Google Maps now, they're taking
7500000	7502000	pictures inside of places.
7502000	7504000	Like, even like there's a nail
7504000	7506000	salon up the street, you can look inside
7506000	7508000	it and do the whole panoramic. Have you heard of
7508000	7510000	what's it called, the secret door or something?
7510000	7512000	It uses that inside view
7512000	7514000	it takes you
7514000	7516000	to random places around the world.
7516000	7518000	There's an animation
7518000	7520000	of a door opening and then you're
7520000	7522000	quote inside with the
7522000	7524000	Google view. I had no idea
7524000	7526000	that this was, I guess, I tweeted
7526000	7528000	about it because I'm like, whoa, the Wii U thing
7528000	7530000	lets you go inside places now and somebody
7530000	7532000	responded and said, actually Google
7532000	7534000	added that a while ago. I guess I missed that
7534000	7536000	but that was, that's crazy. Now I have to ask
7536000	7538000	the software I know is free right now.
7538000	7540000	Yeah. But
7540000	7542000	it's not going to be free forever.
7542000	7544000	Is this something that someone would actually pay for?
7544000	7546000	I mean, because it seems kind of dumb.
7546000	7548000	No, because it's a little choppy. I mean
7548000	7550000	it's neat, it's a really neat concept.
7550000	7552000	But
7552000	7554000	it's probably like internet browser where it's going to be
7554000	7556000	free for forever and then they'll charge for it at some point.
7556000	7558000	That's what I'm saying.
7558000	7560000	Well, they have this other thing that they're charging for
7560000	7562000	that are videos. Like, you can
7562000	7564000	download a video of a double decker
7564000	7566000	tour thing going through, you know, parts
7566000	7568000	of London and you can do the whole pan
7568000	7570000	around with the thing. But they want to
7570000	7572000	charge you like $1.50 for
7572000	7574000	a couple minute, essentially like a two minute video.
7574000	7576000	That's silly. But there's a demo
7576000	7578000	that has a little bit of all of them and
7578000	7580000	that's well enough. Anyway, sorry Jamie.
7580000	7582000	Alright, well, um,
7582000	7584000	for people who own a Wii U, there
7584000	7586000	is a freebie out there.
7586000	7588000	Tank Tank Tank is free on the Wii U
7588000	7590000	eShop. Um, and then
7590000	7592000	there's paid DLC.
7592000	7594000	And then there's also Kung Fu Rabbit.
7594000	7596000	So, uh, there also
7596000	7598000	are virtual console updates with other
7598000	7600000	games, um, including, these aren't
7600000	7602000	free by the way. Pac-Man and Mega-Man
7602000	7604000	are five bucks a pop.
7604000	7606000	And then, um,
7606000	7608000	there are also, let's see,
7608000	7610000	there's some sales. There's Nano Assault Neo.
7610000	7612000	Zen Pinball 2.
7612000	7614000	And then on the 3DS, there will be
7614000	7616000	Bear Shark. Bear Shark.
7616000	7618000	Okay. Gummy Bear's Magical
7618000	7620000	Medallion. My Writing Stables 3D.
7620000	7622000	Armageddon Operation Dragon.
7622000	7624000	Balloon Fight. Yay.
7624000	7626000	Um, and then on sale will be Marvel Pinball
7626000	7628000	3D. 3D Classics Kirby's
7628000	7630000	Adventure. Uh, Dylan's
7630000	7632000	Rolling Western. Pushmo.
7632000	7634000	Fluidity Spin Cycle. That just makes
7634000	7636000	me think of laundry.
7636000	7638000	Um, Tokyo Crash Mobs, Nano Assault
7638000	7640000	EX, Art of Balance Touch, and Fun
7640000	7642000	Fun Mini Golf Touch.
7644000	7646000	Cool. Alright.
7646000	7648000	Uh, oh wait, I just want to say real quick. I actually played
7648000	7650000	the Tang Tang Tank. I downloaded it. Cause
7650000	7652000	now Nintendo has that cutting edge
7652000	7654000	technology where it finally downloads things in the background.
7654000	7656000	So I just set it up to download the one gig thing,
7656000	7658000	whatever. It's really crippled
7658000	7660000	because you can't even do story mode in
7660000	7662000	it. All you can do is you can do like the versus mode
7662000	7664000	or whatever like three times a day.
7664000	7666000	And it's kind of silly. Like,
7666000	7668000	there's not a lot to it. I was
7668000	7670000	I was, you can't do it online
7670000	7672000	or anything. Like, what's the point
7672000	7674000	of Tang Tang Tank with the silly pictures
7674000	7676000	if you can't play it online? It's not free to play. It's a demo.
7676000	7678000	Yes, it is. It's a demo.
7678000	7680000	It's not free to play. It's not free to play, yeah.
7680000	7682000	So it's weird to me that we're calling this
7682000	7684000	free to play. I mean, I understand that's how the news
7684000	7686000	is reporting it. That's how Namco and Nintendo
7686000	7688000	and all that. It's a demo.
7688000	7690000	But it's just a demo you can kind of keep playing
7690000	7692000	over and over again. I mean, maybe that's
7692000	7694000	Well, you can't keep playing
7694000	7696000	it over and over again because you're locked
7696000	7698000	three times. Then you run out of energy.
7698000	7700000	I'm sorry.
7700000	7702000	Let me put it this way.
7702000	7704000	That, I think the whole like time
7704000	7706000	limit demo thing, you know, for
7706000	7708000	you know, multiple
7708000	7710000	plays is stupid.
7710000	7712000	Saints Row, when that first came out
7712000	7714000	as a demo, was a 30 minute demo. I played
7714000	7716000	the crap out of it. I played it over and over and over again.
7716000	7718000	And it got me really hyped about the game.
7718000	7720000	If I was only limited to play that three times a day,
7720000	7722000	say, oh hey, I want to
7722000	7724000	show my friend this game that's really awesome
7724000	7726000	that I'm super hyped up about. Oh fuck, I can't play
7726000	7728000	it until tomorrow because they're being fucktards
7728000	7730000	about it. I mean, it's stupid.
7730000	7732000	YYR in chat says, got news
7732000	7734000	for you, Tank Tank Tank's retail version doesn't
7734000	7736000	have online play either. You know, I feared
7736000	7738000	that and how
7738000	7740000	derpy dumb is that? That should have
7740000	7742000	been an obvious thing to
7742000	7744000	put in the game, but no.
7744000	7746000	It just seems to me like that's a game though that,
7746000	7748000	and I was excited about it for a while, but it just seems like
7748000	7750000	it would lose something being outside of the arcade too.
7750000	7752000	Yeah, especially when you're sitting in the house
7752000	7754000	playing it by yourself, it's just not the same, you know?
7754000	7756000	Well, no one wants to play by themselves, Rob.
7756000	7758000	Well, apparently Break Man does.
7758000	7760000	If you remember earlier.
7760000	7762000	Playing with yourself really should only be like, nevermind.
7762000	7764000	I liked playing it in the
7764000	7766000	arcade because I could just reach over and smack Dan
7766000	7768000	in the head. Sometimes.
7768000	7770000	I like taking the pictures
7770000	7772000	with the little wigs and things.
7772000	7774000	Alan said I looked like Nicki Minaj in one of them.
7774000	7776000	Great!
7776000	7778000	Actually, one of my old live journal
7778000	7780000	icons is the little tank with the squid
7780000	7782000	in it going, thank you.
7782000	7784000	So.
7784000	7786000	Let's move on, Logie.
7786000	7788000	Alright, so let's see.
7788000	7790000	Let's talk about
7790000	7792000	Call of Duty. And I mean, we kind of knew this
7792000	7794000	was coming because they had all this
7794000	7796000	stuff at retailers, posters
7796000	7798000	and information were leaking out about
7798000	7800000	Call of Duty Ghosts. And they finally
7800000	7802000	had their announcement, yes, it's
7802000	7804000	going to be coming out. It isn't as
7804000	7806000	it was rumored to be coming out on
7806000	7808000	next gen only. It's going to be coming out on
7808000	7810000	Playstation 3, Xbox 360
7810000	7812000	and PC on November 5th
7812000	7814000	and also next generation platforms
7814000	7816000	at an unspecified date.
7816000	7818000	No Wii U version was announced
7818000	7820000	and I can also confirm that there is no
7820000	7822000	Wii U version as of right now.
7822000	7824000	Unless it's something that they're saving for some
7824000	7826000	Wii U thing that they're going to say, oh by the way
7826000	7828000	it's Wii U now too. But
7828000	7830000	I just don't know if they made their money
7830000	7832000	back on the Wii U version. I think that's what a lot of these
7832000	7834000	companies are coming to decide that like
7834000	7836000	hey, we're not really making a lot of money on it.
7836000	7838000	But, apparently
7838000	7840000	it's going to revolve around Ghost
7840000	7842000	from Modern Warfare 2
7842000	7844000	and they did
7844000	7846000	say that the next gen
7846000	7848000	version of the game is going to
7848000	7850000	have a brand new engine.
7850000	7852000	Current gen version, sorry, it's going to be running on the same engine
7852000	7854000	that Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3
7854000	7856000	are running on.
7856000	7858000	If you want to make that argument, it's the same game each
7858000	7860000	year, go ahead.
7860000	7862000	It'll be slightly different.
7862000	7864000	I'm looking forward to it.
7864000	7866000	I've played quite a bit Call of Duty recently.
7866000	7868000	I think you and a lot of people
7868000	7870000	look forward to it. These games always sell like crazy.
7870000	7872000	I don't look for it to be that different, I just look
7872000	7874000	for it to be fun. I mean, that's really it.
7874000	7876000	The single player campaign
7876000	7878000	might be cool because now I'm going back and playing through
7878000	7880000	all the single player campaigns from them.
7880000	7882000	But as long as the multiplayer is fun,
7882000	7884000	I don't know. I really wish they would just put
7884000	7886000	a multiplayer version of that, only make it
7886000	7888000	maybe half the price or something.
7888000	7890000	But then, of course, they'd be cutting out profits.
7890000	7892000	That's right. Profits, profits, profits!
7894000	7896000	Alright, anyhow, I'm
7896000	7898000	so excited, you guys. It's been forever
7898000	7900000	since we've been able to do a segment like this.
7900000	7902000	The way this segment
7902000	7904000	ties to games is really loose, but you
7904000	7906000	know what? We've got to bring in an
7906000	7908000	opportunity to make fun of local news!
7912000	7914000	Which I realize is the same as our
7914000	7916000	breaking news theme, or NBC's
7916000	7918000	breaking news theme, but you know what?
7918000	7920000	It's all dramatic, all the same.
7920000	7922000	So, this is about,
7922000	7924000	and I know so many of you have read about this,
7924000	7926000	this is about a man in New
7926000	7928000	Hampshire who was robbed
7928000	7930000	at a carnival game trying to
7930000	7932000	win an Xbox Kinect. That's
7932000	7934000	the only way this ties to video games,
7934000	7936000	that the ultimate prize was an Xbox Kinect.
7936000	7938000	But you guys, this story is
7938000	7940000	freaking priceless.
7940000	7942000	It's too dumb to be real. It's priceless.
7942000	7944000	It makes me think of The Onion.
7944000	7946000	Courtesy of ABC 40,
7946000	7948000	coming out of, where are they
7948000	7950000	based? Springfield. And Fox
7950000	7952000	6, I guess they're owned by the same people.
7952000	7954000	So here you go, courtesy of these guys.
7954000	7956000	A clip from the local news.
7956000	7958000	I've searched years for the perfect mattress.
7958000	7960000	I don't care about the perfect mattress.
7960000	7962000	Mattress Hunter! He searched for
7962000	7964000	the perfect mattress. I didn't say
7964000	7966000	local commercials, I said local news.
7966000	7968000	Badly animated flash animation.
7968000	7970000	Alright, here we go.
7970000	7972000	Henry
7972000	7974000	Greboom says he lost his life savings.
7974000	7976000	$2600
7976000	7978000	on a carnival game and all he has to show
7978000	7980000	for it is this stuffed banana
7980000	7982000	with dreadlocks.
7986000	7988000	What kind of idiot?
7988000	7990000	He has a stuffed banana with
7990000	7992000	dreadlocks. You guys have to see the picture. Let me make a prediction
7992000	7994000	that this banana will go up on
7994000	7996000	eBay with this story and he will make
7996000	7998000	money. Right? And then
7998000	8000000	he's in cahoots with ABC 40.
8000000	8002000	We were expecting to win a few things and
8002000	8004000	let the kids have a good time.
8004000	8006000	It just didn't turn out that way.
8006000	8008000	Greboom says he attended a Manchester
8008000	8010000	carnival run by Fiesta shows
8010000	8012000	and wanted to win an Xbox
8012000	8014000	Kinect at a game called Tubbs
8014000	8016000	of Fun.
8018000	8020000	It's right next to the pinball.
8020000	8022000	Tubbs of Fun. It's probably not
8022000	8024000	actually Kinect. I'm guessing it's probably
8024000	8026000	an Xbox console with Kinect.
8026000	8028000	I'm thinking. Because how else
8028000	8030000	could you justify $2600?
8030000	8032000	I mean that's how much you've been thinking.
8032000	8034000	I'm thinking that he's a little
8034000	8036000	misrepresented. Tubbs of Fun.
8036000	8038000	Our contestants toss
8038000	8040000	balls into a tub.
8040000	8042000	When he practiced he says... Sorry guys.
8042000	8044000	It's at max volume so I apologize. This is a little
8044000	8046000	low. Sorry. It was easy.
8046000	8048000	But something changed when he started
8048000	8050000	playing for the prize and the balls
8050000	8052000	kept popping out.
8052000	8054000	The balls
8054000	8056000	kept popping out.
8056000	8058000	It's one of those games. It's clearly that game where you
8058000	8060000	throw the baseball into the little... It's like the angled
8060000	8062000	bucket, right? Kind of ski ball-ish.
8062000	8064000	Yeah. But I'm sure they switched
8064000	8066000	the ball on you at the last minute or whatever.
8066000	8068000	It's not possible that it wasn't rigged.
8068000	8070000	Greboom says he kept trying
8070000	8072000	to win back his money by going double
8072000	8074000	or nothing. He dropped
8074000	8076000	$300 in just a few minutes.
8076000	8078000	Why do they have this guy walking
8078000	8080000	down the street pushing his baby in the
8080000	8082000	roller with this giant banana with dreadlocks?
8082000	8084000	That's what cracks me up.
8084000	8086000	I want to know why they're giving
8086000	8088000	this fuckwad any attention at all.
8088000	8090000	Because it's so ridiculous.
8090000	8092000	Because it's funny.
8092000	8094000	It's not funny. It's sad.
8094000	8096000	It's like those gambling people, you know?
8096000	8098000	...at $2300 more
8098000	8100000	and soon lost all that as well.
8100000	8102000	I know it's a difficult game.
8102000	8104000	I've tried it myself. I've done it
8104000	8106000	once. Missed probably 20 times.
8106000	8108000	Fiesta Show says the game is run by an
8108000	8110000	independent contractor who's worked for
8110000	8112000	Fiesta for years. It's interviewing
8112000	8114000	the contractor to see what happened.
8114000	8116000	Queen Simia in our chat room
8116000	8118000	brings up a good point. On the plus side, that's a
8118000	8120000	really big banana. Literally
8120000	8122000	that's what she said.
8122000	8124000	Are there any scams at all
8124000	8126000	with any of the games? Not that I'm aware of.
8126000	8128000	We've had a lot of these game operators
8128000	8130000	with us for years. The Traveling Carnival
8130000	8132000	is now setting up here in Derry,
8132000	8134000	New Hampshire, but you will not see
8134000	8136000	Tubbs of Fun.
8136000	8138000	Because he's taking a vacation because
8138000	8140000	he just made $2300.
8140000	8142000	He's like, fuck that. I can skip this next one.
8142000	8144000	It's the seriousness of that. You will not see
8144000	8146000	Tubbs of Fun or any fun
8146000	8148000	whatsoever.
8148000	8150000	Is this the Daily Show right now?
8150000	8152000	That's why
8152000	8154000	I thought this was onion-worthy.
8154000	8156000	But if
8156000	8158000	I had $2600
8158000	8160000	as my savings
8160000	8162000	and I wanted to buy an
8162000	8164000	Xbox. But Jamie, he was just
8164000	8166000	addicted. He had to keep doubling down.
8166000	8168000	He had to win that money back. And he's a fucking idiot.
8168000	8170000	Allegedly.
8170000	8172000	Allegedly. No, I'm saying it.
8172000	8174000	I'm going on record. In my opinion
8174000	8176000	sir, Mr. Banana,
8176000	8178000	you are Tubbs
8178000	8180000	of Stupid. And now he has this
8180000	8182000	giant banana he's got to feed too as well as
8182000	8184000	his children. I mean a banana of that
8184000	8186000	size is going to eat a lot of food.
8186000	8188000	Donkey Kong is coming for you.
8188000	8190000	That's a lot of potassium.
8190000	8192000	And maybe listen to a lot of reggae.
8192000	8194000	And smoke some stuff.
8194000	8196000	Independent contractor that runs
8196000	8198000	the game is not allowed to set up
8198000	8200000	while an investigation
8200000	8202000	is taking place. Because you get caught
8202000	8204000	up in the whole double or nothing. I've got to
8204000	8206000	win my money back. Henry says he went back
8206000	8208000	Notice something about this shot.
8208000	8210000	Jamie, I want to point this out to you while this guy is being
8210000	8212000	interviewed. The baby is left
8212000	8214000	alone in the stroller with only the
8214000	8216000	banana to comfort him. And he's
8216000	8218000	struggling to get out.
8218000	8220000	Did you see what Bobby just linked in chat?
8220000	8222000	No.
8222000	8224000	CollegeHumor wants
8224000	8226000	to pay $2600
8226000	8228000	for a giant dreadlock
8228000	8230000	stuffed banana. Of course.
8230000	8232000	This guy will end up making a profit
8232000	8234000	off this story. He will sell it on eBay.
8234000	8236000	Oh my god. And
8236000	8238000	here we are in debt.
8238000	8240000	He's just an idiot.
8240000	8242000	Why would you try? I mean, come on.
8242000	8244000	I understand that you may have gotten caught
8244000	8246000	up in the moment, but
8246000	8248000	it's not like you're gambling to win money
8248000	8250000	in a casino. You're gambling to win
8250000	8252000	an object that has a certain value.
8252000	8254000	And that value is certainly not
8254000	8256000	$2600. How many people who lose
8256000	8258000	money in casinos do they interview saying
8258000	8260000	men but life savings playing
8260000	8262000	penny slots. Yeah, but you can't
8262000	8264000	win a banana with dreadlocks at a casino.
8264000	8266000	Yes, you can.
8266000	8268000	Oh, really, bitch? Yes, you can.
8268000	8270000	Well, you can get things that are equally
8270000	8272000	as ridiculous. Like, you know, Circus Circus
8272000	8274000	and Excalibur have all those little
8274000	8276000	games in the basement. I want to know.
8276000	8278000	Hold on, hold on. Raginator in chat says
8278000	8280000	will he get a hammock for that banana?
8280000	8282000	That's a good question. It's big
8282000	8284000	enough. BlackWolf wants to know
8284000	8286000	or BlackWolf suggests we need a giant
8286000	8288000	orange with dreadlocks. Instant
8288000	8290000	money. You know what, Bobby? I can make that for
8290000	8292000	15 bucks. I'll do
8292000	8294000	it, too. Who designs
8294000	8296000	these stuff things like they're
8296000	8298000	like, was it like a dartboard
8298000	8300000	like a dartboard? It says, you know,
8300000	8302000	fruit and the accessory
8302000	8304000	banana
8304000	8306000	dreadlocks, orange
8306000	8308000	cowboy hat. They should
8308000	8310000	freaking hire me. I could just I could design some
8310000	8312000	really disturbing stuff. The Chinese
8312000	8314000	he went back the next day to complain
8314000	8316000	and the man running the game gave
8316000	8318000	him back $600.
8318000	8320000	See, that's the crazy. The guy gave him back
8320000	8322000	$600. What carny gives you money
8322000	8324000	back?
8324000	8326000	Sorry for you. Yeah, that's where
8326000	8328000	the story gets shady. Why did the carny give
8328000	8330000	him money back? Probably because he's like, I bet
8330000	8332000	my life savings and the guy felt a little bit bad.
8332000	8334000	I mean, I mean, how much the guy
8334000	8336000	is just making cash. I mean, he's not losing
8336000	8338000	any. There's nothing to really run this game.
8338000	8340000	Let's wrap this up and re split with
8340000	8342000	the banana and the cash.
8342000	8344000	Thank you for working that pun in.
8344000	8346000	Oh, thank you. I was
8346000	8348000	worried that
8348000	8350000	I love you. Local news. He's
8350000	8352000	split with a banana and
8352000	8354000	filed a report with Manchester PD
8354000	8356000	for once in my life. I happen to become
8356000	8358000	that sucker. At least
8358000	8360000	he admits it.
8360000	8362000	I
8362000	8364000	did.
8364000	8366000	Did he redeem himself
8366000	8368000	a little bit for at least a minute? No,
8368000	8370000	because he's still stupid. You
8370000	8372000	can admit that you're stupid, but it doesn't change that
8372000	8374000	you're stupid. He admits
8374000	8376000	that you're stupid. He's
8376000	8378000	actually pretty much ruined his
8378000	8380000	whole case because he admitted
8380000	8382000	that he was fooled.
8382000	8384000	Dear College
8384000	8386000	Humor, give me
8386000	8388000	$2600
8388000	8390000	and I will draw you a banana with
8390000	8392000	dreadlocks. I will go find you that banana.
8392000	8394000	I'm sure we can purchase it on the internet.
8394000	8396000	With $2600, I'll
8396000	8398000	buy a plane ticket to Hong Kong and go find
8398000	8400000	the manufacturer factory and get one.
8400000	8402000	Let me finish my plea for a job.
8402000	8404000	Dear College Humor,
8404000	8406000	contract me for $2600 to do nothing
8406000	8408000	but make fun of this guy.
8408000	8410000	I promise you I could do it for days on end.
8410000	8412000	I would never get tired.
8412000	8414000	YYR
8414000	8416000	says that was some hardcore
8416000	8418000	punography.
8418000	8420000	Punography.
8420000	8422000	It would only be if the pun was written.
8422000	8424000	Let's go to the mailbag.
8424000	8426000	Let's see what lovely puns await us
8426000	8428000	in the mailbag.
8428000	8430000	Every week you guys send us emails.
8430000	8432000	Mailbag at
8432000	8434000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8434000	8436000	and we pick a few of our favorite emails and read them
8436000	8438000	here on the show. DarkSakura,
8438000	8440000	what do we have tonight?
8440000	8442000	People tripping.
8442000	8444000	This one is titled, Damn
8444000	8446000	Used Games.
8446000	8448000	And this comes from someone with
8448000	8450000	a very unpronounceable name so I'm just going to say
8450000	8452000	read the email.
8452000	8454000	Hello OLR cast, my name is Zile Scott.
8454000	8456000	Thank you. You said the name.
8456000	8458000	He sold me to.
8458000	8460000	Put your name in the body of the email.
8460000	8462000	I'm going to read it.
8462000	8464000	I was just wondering if any of you guys know of a website
8464000	8466000	that I could print out cover art for used games
8466000	8468000	that have lost their original
8468000	8470000	it's not T-H-E-R-E
8470000	8472000	it's T-H-E-I-R original
8472000	8474000	case.
8474000	8476000	I recently bought a shitload of PS1 games
8476000	8478000	and none of them have cover art.
8478000	8480000	It makes me sad and annoyed.
8480000	8482000	Anyway, thanks and keep on with the great work.
8482000	8484000	Hugs and shit.
8484000	8486000	I don't know of any sites per se.
8487000	8489000	Not even.
8489000	8491000	Honestly, you know what I do in his position?
8491000	8493000	Just go to Google Image Search
8493000	8495000	and search for the game
8495000	8497000	Look for large.
8497000	8499000	And do large.
8499000	8501000	Don't blow up a medium size because it will look terrible when you print it out.
8501000	8503000	Or you can pay me $2600
8503000	8505000	and I will go get all the shit
8505000	8507000	printed for you at King Ghost
8507000	8509000	and it will all be nice.
8509000	8511000	You pay me triple that and I'll redraw it all for you.
8511000	8513000	Honestly, yeah, Google Image Search
8513000	8515000	is what I would use.
8515000	8517000	Worst case scenario, Amazon.
8517000	8519000	That's how you find a lot of missing CD covers.
8519000	8521000	But if you don't want it to look shitty
8521000	8523000	look for Hi-Rez.
8523000	8525000	Queen Simeon in our chatroom says
8525000	8527000	draw your own. Those are the best.
8527000	8529000	Our Dracula X copy that
8529000	8531000	Kristen made us back in the day
8531000	8533000	has her little stick figure
8533000	8535000	Richter Belmont
8535000	8537000	with flaily arms
8537000	8539000	and a whip.
8539000	8541000	No, you know what this guy needs?
8541000	8543000	This guy needs video game covers
8543000	8545000	Comic Sans and clipart.
8545000	8547000	Have you seen this?
8547000	8549000	That's what you need, sir.
8549000	8551000	You need to just forgo the original covers
8551000	8553000	and get Comic Sans and clipart
8553000	8555000	redos, reimaginings
8555000	8557000	Do it yourself. It can be a fun project.
8557000	8559000	That's right. Why not?
8559000	8561000	Make the best out of it.
8561000	8563000	For the record, Rob, those make baby Satan cry.
8563000	8565000	Make baby Satan cry?
8565000	8567000	Little fiery tears.
8567000	8569000	Little tears of lava.
8569000	8571000	You want to hear something really crazy?
8571000	8573000	More than one manufacturer of giant bananas
8573000	8575000	with...
8575000	8577000	God, you looked it up.
8577000	8579000	It's just seriously strange.
8579000	8581000	They seriously have one.
8581000	8583000	It's not exactly the same banana.
8583000	8585000	It's 150 bucks, by the way.
8585000	8587000	It's uglier. 150 bucks?
8587000	8589000	Well, that guy got a pretty good deal.
8589000	8591000	No, he didn't.
8591000	8593000	He got 600 of his bucks back
8593000	8595000	and then $150.
8595000	8597000	He only lost two thirds of his money.
8597000	8599000	For a carnival, that's not bad.
8599000	8601000	And he had
8601000	8603000	tubs of fun, people.
8603000	8605000	Tubs of fun.
8605000	8607000	For the record, I need to find those covers that
8607000	8609000	Krista drew me back in the day and scan them in
8609000	8611000	because they're freaking hilarious.
8611000	8613000	Especially the one for Emerald Dragon that was pretty funny, too.
8613000	8615000	Dungeonbuster in chat says,
8615000	8617000	Someone who missed out on the Nino Cooney Wizards book
8617000	8619000	made his own. That was awesome.
8619000	8621000	But you can still hire me and I will be
8621000	8623000	more than happy to lay out anything you want me to.
8623000	8625000	Let it go. Get to the next email.
8625000	8627000	Hey, I've actually got a job option.
8627000	8629000	You know what?
8629000	8631000	You know what? Just print your own bananas with dreadlocks
8631000	8633000	for the cover. Final Fantasy 7,
8633000	8635000	banana with dreadlocks. Actually, banana
8635000	8637000	with spiky mohawk for Final Fantasy 7.
8637000	8639000	I predict this year. It has me crying.
8639000	8641000	This year, instead of
8641000	8643000	space ponchos, it's all about bananas with dreadlocks.
8643000	8645000	That is going to be the new trend.
8645000	8647000	Bananas with dreadlocks. Why not?
8647000	8649000	You know, actually, I was thinking of applying
8649000	8651000	for the River Cats. Oh, yeah?
8651000	8653000	They have a marketing position open. They do.
8653000	8655000	My mom was- It's a full year, full time.
8655000	8657000	My mom was telling me to go for an announcer
8657000	8659000	position with them some time ago and I was like,
8659000	8661000	really? Me announcing baseball?
8661000	8663000	Do you really see that? It would be hilarious.
8663000	8665000	I'm the guy, hit the ball and things happen
8665000	8667000	and somebody just caught it.
8667000	8669000	Oh my god, y'all. Balls are flying
8669000	8671000	everywhere.
8671000	8673000	No.
8673000	8675000	The pitcher
8675000	8677000	just hit the batter.
8677000	8679000	Girl.
8679000	8681000	Shut up.
8681000	8683000	Alright, next email, dammit. We only have one
8683000	8685000	more. Hello, O.L.R.
8685000	8687000	Hi.
8687000	8689000	What was that?
8689000	8691000	You went high and I lost my
8691000	8693000	shoes.
8693000	8695000	I was being nice to the listeners.
8695000	8697000	You said hello, I said hello.
8697000	8699000	Rab!
8699000	8701000	I've got a question for all the hosts.
8701000	8703000	There are many games
8703000	8705000	across all generations that have become
8705000	8707000	known for their final boss fights, such as
8707000	8709000	The Doomsday Zone and Sonic 3
8709000	8711000	and Knuckles or GLaDOS and Portal.
8711000	8713000	My question to you is, which final
8713000	8715000	boss fight in a game is your favorite?
8715000	8717000	As for mine, I know you guys
8717000	8719000	don't like the game
8719000	8721000	getting a lot of praise, but I absolutely love
8721000	8723000	the final fight against
8723000	8725000	Ganon in The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
8725000	8727000	From the moment he transforms into
8727000	8729000	the beast that we knew from the previous
8729000	8731000	games in the series, the music sends chills
8731000	8733000	down my spine, as well as the
8733000	8735000	setting of a fallen castle is surrounded
8735000	8737000	in both flames and the crashes
8737000	8739000	of lightning and thunder across the sky,
8739000	8741000	with Zelda's standing watch,
8741000	8743000	sometimes screaming in fear when Link takes
8743000	8745000	a blow from Ganon. If you need your memory
8745000	8747000	refreshed of why I think this fight is so awesome, you can watch
8747000	8749000	it here, not clicking the link, because I know.
8749000	8751000	Thanks for reading, Ocifer.
8751000	8753000	PS, this email has been brought to you
8753000	8755000	by me and my everlasting love of the show
8755000	8757000	hosted by the gingerbread man.
8757000	8759000	Um, I would say that
8759000	8761000	when I was younger,
8761000	8763000	like, it was probably this
8763000	8765000	battle.
8765000	8767000	Yes!
8767000	8769000	Eat your damn vegetables, you stupid frog!
8769000	8771000	Because the war battle
8771000	8773000	was pretty epic at that time.
8773000	8775000	Like, this music was just like,
8775000	8777000	oh my god, he's gonna kill me!
8777000	8779000	And then you feed him veggies and it's okay.
8779000	8781000	Uh, otherwise,
8781000	8783000	maybe the Kefka battle in Final Fantasy 6
8783000	8785000	was pretty damn epic. Uh, I
8785000	8787000	honestly, not that
8787000	8789000	the battle itself was epic, but
8789000	8791000	the original Metal Gear on the NES,
8791000	8793000	that whole ending sequence
8793000	8795000	was pretty damn amazing.
8795000	8797000	Well, you mentioned the Kefka battle.
8797000	8799000	It was waiting
8799000	8801000	for Shadow at the end of
8801000	8803000	the game that was, like, the big
8803000	8805000	epic teaser.
8805000	8807000	Um, honestly,
8807000	8809000	um, I liked Final Fantasy 7's
8809000	8811000	final battle, because it was so fucking
8811000	8813000	easy and I could make a sandwich.
8813000	8815000	While the whole thing was on autoplay.
8815000	8817000	Um, god, there was another one, though,
8817000	8819000	that I, um,
8819000	8821000	I remember being completely happy with the
8821000	8823000	ending, more that I was
8823000	8825000	with the last battle. You know what?
8825000	8827000	I always liked the last fights, the Wily
8827000	8829000	fights in the Mega Man games, because it is the
8829000	8831000	stupidest weapon that you use.
8831000	8833000	Mega Man 3 used Top Man's weapon, the fuck.
8833000	8835000	Bubble Man 2, or Bubble Man in Mega Man 2.
8835000	8837000	Yeah, but Bubble Lead was actually useful.
8837000	8839000	Yes, it was, but to shoot it, to kill a
8839000	8841000	boss in an empty room,
8841000	8843000	that sucked.
8843000	8845000	No, getting Top Man and
8845000	8847000	jumping on top of the Wily floater thing.
8847000	8849000	You have to kill him by topping him.
8849000	8851000	You have to top his floater.
8851000	8853000	Um, there was a few,
8853000	8855000	there was. Loki, what about you?
8855000	8857000	Epic boss battles, do you remember?
8857000	8859000	Um,
8859000	8861000	I can't
8861000	8863000	really think of any
8863000	8865000	big boss battles, um,
8865000	8867000	I guess some of the boss battles
8867000	8869000	in Earth Defense Force are pretty epic.
8869000	8871000	Especially some of the later levels, they were just
8871000	8873000	ridiculous. But, um,
8873000	8875000	I haven't played anything with
8875000	8877000	real big boss battles lately.
8877000	8879000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.
8879000	8881000	Yeah, the Technodrome fight.
8881000	8883000	Um,
8883000	8885000	God, I remember the first time I beat
8885000	8887000	that game, too. It was, it was actually
8887000	8889000	the day my little brother got hit by a car.
8889000	8891000	Aww. And so, my
8891000	8893000	Grandmom left me and my friend Jennifer at the mall
8893000	8895000	back when it was the old school lands castle
8895000	8897000	that still had carpeted walls.
8897000	8899000	Before Namco bought it.
8899000	8901000	Yep. And, uh,
8901000	8903000	These guys
8903000	8905000	gave me money to help them
8905000	8907000	beat the game. They, um, they paid for me to play
8907000	8909000	as Leonardo, because that was the only slot open.
8909000	8911000	And we had just beaten the game, and the thing
8911000	8913000	was just starting, and they turned off all the machines
8913000	8915000	because it was time to go. I know, I know.
8915000	8917000	I know one epic boss battle.
8917000	8919000	I got my revenge because I got to do the same thing.
8919000	8921000	Max 300 is pretty epic
8921000	8923000	getting to that. Yeah.
8923000	8925000	I can, you know, I can consider that, or, um,
8925000	8927000	shoot.
8927000	8929000	The Legend of Max? No, um,
8929000	8931000	Robo Z.
8931000	8933000	In, uh, Bust a Move.
8933000	8935000	Because remember that, you're
8935000	8937000	going through the game, and everybody's your size
8937000	8939000	and everything.
8939000	8941000	Pull up, pull up, fly into your soul.
8941000	8943000	Real quick.
8943000	8945000	And for anyone who, um,
8945000	8947000	hasn't played the game, like, um,
8947000	8949000	uh, Bust a Move,
8949000	8951000	uh,
8951000	8953000	that came out in the US, and, um,
8953000	8955000	in the US, it was Bust a Groove.
8955000	8957000	In Japan, it was Bust a Move.
8957000	8959000	You can hear this music start.
8959000	8961000	And you're on a building,
8961000	8963000	you're this little teeny tiny thing
8963000	8965000	with a robot, like,
8965000	8967000	this bigger than the building.
8967000	8969000	Like, twice the size of the building.
8969000	8971000	It was epic. You have cars running
8971000	8973000	off the edges, and all this
8973000	8975000	shit, and, oh my god,
8975000	8977000	that was the best game.
8977000	8979000	Alright. Good email.
8979000	8981000	Thank you.
8981000	8983000	I'm actually gonna say that Robo Z
8983000	8985000	is my
8985000	8987000	number one favorite boss battle.
8987000	8989000	Number one favorite boss battle.
8989000	8991000	Alright, uh, if that's it for emails,
8991000	8993000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com
8993000	8995000	if you want to get in on a future email
8995000	8997000	bag segment. Uh, let us
8997000	8999000	get to the FUs of the week.
8999000	9001000	It's the part of the show where we get angsty.
9001000	9003000	Why? Um,
9003000	9005000	I don't know.
9005000	9007000	...
9007000	9009000	...
9009000	9011000	...
9011000	9013000	...
9013000	9015000	...
9015000	9017000	...
9017000	9019000	...
9019000	9021000	I have two. The first one goes
9021000	9023000	towards me. I think I'm fighting off something.
9023000	9025000	So I'm just probably gonna take it easy tomorrow.
9025000	9027000	Um, cause,
9027000	9029000	well, I think that I'm just a little worn
9029000	9031000	down because I've maybe gotten
9031000	9033000	five hours of sleep, uh, last night and the
9033000	9035000	night before and then went to the baseball game yesterday
9035000	9037000	and was up all night and it was a new stuff.
9037000	9039000	And, actually I have three.
9039000	9041000	It turns out that my wheat and corn allergy
9041000	9043000	is a lot worse than I thought.
9043000	9045000	Which, the only reason I eat anything wheat
9045000	9047000	today is because I took plenty of Enidril before the show.
9047000	9049000	But I think that it's
9049000	9051000	definitely gonna have to get cut out altogether
9051000	9053000	and I keep pushing it and
9053000	9055000	I'm just happier without it, you know.
9055000	9057000	It hasn't stopped me from having ice cream.
9057000	9059000	I can have ice cream as long as I don't have cookies
9059000	9061000	in my ice cream. So.
9061000	9063000	The cookies are good though.
9063000	9065000	Rob, I can get gluten free cookies.
9065000	9067000	There you go.
9067000	9069000	And, um, the other one, uh,
9069000	9071000	goes towards
9071000	9073000	there not being an actual third
9073000	9075000	Bust-A-Move game.
9075000	9077000	And not counting Dance Summit.
9077000	9079000	I'm not counting Dance Summit.
9079000	9081000	We need an actual new Bust-A-Move game.
9081000	9083000	Dear Squeenix,
9083000	9085000	Dear Squa part of Enix,
9085000	9087000	when you absorbed the
9087000	9089000	Enix to become the conglomerate of
9089000	9091000	Squeenix, you also inherited
9091000	9093000	the Bust-A-Move series.
9093000	9095000	Do something with it!
9095000	9097000	The end.
9119000	9121000	Um, Frisbee.
9121000	9123000	Have you ever been headbutted by your son?
9123000	9125000	Um, yes, but that was in my head.
9125000	9127000	Um,
9127000	9129000	Becky was telling me about when Julian
9129000	9131000	was like two, he would run in while
9131000	9133000	Chris was playing Xbox games and headbutt him
9133000	9135000	in the crotch. Nice.
9135000	9137000	He was an accident. He doesn't know how to
9137000	9139000	throw a Frisbee correctly yet, so
9139000	9141000	he threw it behind him. You'll learn him.
9141000	9143000	He was a good kid.
9143000	9145000	My FU of the Week goes to the
9145000	9147000	fact that Alan made all these french fries
9147000	9149000	before the show and I ate them all
9149000	9151000	and this is why I'm bad.
9151000	9153000	Bad.
9153000	9155000	But they were so good.
9155000	9157000	Two more stories, then we're gonna open up the
9157000	9159000	Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR
9159000	9161000	or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9161000	9163000	Two more stories, Loki.
9163000	9165000	So, um, they announced a brand new
9165000	9167000	exclusive game coming to the Ouya.
9167000	9169000	It's, um, being done by
9169000	9171000	KimSwift and Airtight Games
9171000	9173000	who did Quantum Conundrum.
9173000	9175000	It's called Soulfjord.
9175000	9177000	It's a cross between
9177000	9179000	70's Funk and Norse Mythology.
9181000	9183000	And it's got a guy named Magnus Jones
9183000	9185000	who is like a viking with an afro.
9187000	9189000	I don't know, it looks cute. It's like a beaten up game.
9191000	9193000	Is it something I'm gonna be picking up? I don't know.
9193000	9195000	But it's supposed to be, uh,
9195000	9197000	coming, I guess, uh,
9197000	9199000	soon.
9199000	9201000	Not sure it's coming. Like most things, soon.
9201000	9203000	Yeah.
9203000	9205000	One more story for you guys, and this is about a very
9205000	9207000	interesting, uh, demake
9207000	9209000	of a game. And this
9209000	9211000	kind of blows my mind, actually.
9211000	9213000	Um, you know, in China
9213000	9215000	they tend to do this bootleg
9215000	9217000	software. Uh, and a lot of times
9217000	9219000	it's current titles that they cram into
9219000	9221000	these 8-bit carts, and usually they're hacks
9221000	9223000	or things like that. Like, we've seen Tekken, the
9223000	9225000	8-bit version, and all this crazy shit, right?
9225000	9227000	The RPG. Yeah, right? Like, all this crazy
9227000	9229000	shit, right? Well, here's an interesting one
9229000	9231000	they did recently. They demaked
9231000	9233000	Final Fantasy 4. What?
9233000	9235000	Yes, Super Nintendo Final Fantasy 4.
9235000	9237000	They demade it
9237000	9239000	for the Famicom.
9239000	9241000	God dammit.
9241000	9243000	Don't
9243000	9245000	play the smoking commercial. Trickyotomyman!
9245000	9247000	I don't know what, that always
9247000	9249000	made me think of Dennis Leary. God dammit,
9249000	9251000	I just wanted to see the stupid
9251000	9253000	demake, and I got a stupid commercial instead.
9253000	9255000	And I want meat from only cows that smoke.
9255000	9257000	Okay, am I gonna get the commercial again, or am I gonna get the game?
9257000	9259000	Alright. I'm Bill.
9259000	9261000	I've had diabetes since I was a little kid.
9261000	9263000	I was a diabetes guy!
9263000	9265000	When I turn the volume all the way down,
9265000	9267000	it doesn't shut them up. That's annoying.
9267000	9269000	So, sorry, I guess I can't play the music for you guys.
9269000	9271000	Adblock, adblock. But it's very...
9271000	9273000	I'm trying not to use
9273000	9275000	Adblock, because I'm supporting my favorite internet
9275000	9277000	websites. You can whitelist
9277000	9279000	your favorite internet websites. Well, I'm gonna blacklist
9279000	9281000	those sons of bitches, but anyway,
9281000	9283000	because if I can't turn the volume down,
9283000	9285000	anyway, it's
9285000	9287000	got, the soundtrack
9287000	9289000	has been shoved into the 8-bit cartridges
9289000	9291000	very well, which is really amazing,
9291000	9293000	and the, for 8-bit,
9293000	9295000	it looks pretty good, I gotta say.
9295000	9297000	They've spread it across three
9297000	9299000	cartridges, though, because, you know, Super Nintendo
9299000	9301000	versus Nintendo, they have the
9301000	9303000	light game, the dark game, and
9303000	9305000	the, I don't know, the end game, or something
9305000	9307000	like that, and because
9307000	9309000	you can't transfer saves from one
9309000	9311000	to the other, it basically recaps
9311000	9313000	the story when you start one of the, and
9313000	9315000	starts your characters at an appropriate level.
9315000	9317000	You can play them in any order you want. It's just
9317000	9319000	fascinating that somebody did a lot of
9319000	9321000	work to do that for the Famicom.
9323000	9325000	Cool. Imagine if they had focused themselves
9325000	9327000	onto, like, making an
9327000	9329000	original game. I know, right?
9331000	9333000	So there you go. Who does original
9333000	9335000	things anymore? Please.
9335000	9337000	This show's not even
9337000	9339000	original anymore. What the lump.
9339000	9341000	Alright. Now I can't get that image
9341000	9343000	of the chick with the tracheotomy out of my head. God
9343000	9345000	damn you. You know what? I can't get
9345000	9347000	Dennis Leary's voice out of my head now.
9347000	9349000	Cow's the
9349000	9351000	smoke. Had tracheotomies.
9351000	9353000	We're
9353000	9355000	going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAMELR
9355000	9357000	or our username on Skype, Orange
9357000	9359000	Lounge Radio, all one word, if you want to give us
9359000	9361000	a call, and we can talk about
9361000	9363000	whatever. You want to talk about demakes, you want to talk about
9363000	9365000	remakes, you want to talk about anything we've talked
9365000	9367000	about tonight, or something else,
9367000	9369000	give us a call. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word
9369000	9371000	on Skype, or 1-877-GAMELR.
9371000	9373000	In the meantime, I've got some tweets
9373000	9375000	I want to read for you guys.
9375000	9377000	Tigerclaw sent us a few tweets at
9377000	9379000	twitter.com slash O-L-R. First
9379000	9381000	tweet, Sony Korea
9381000	9383000	restricts PlayStation Network to 18
9383000	9385000	plus. You guys hear about this?
9385000	9387000	The Korea PlayStation
9387000	9389000	Network has been down for like 8 or
9389000	9391000	9 months, and it just
9391000	9393000	recently reopened.
9393000	9395000	This is because of a law in South
9395000	9397000	Korea that will
9397000	9399000	keep teens under the age of 16 from
9399000	9401000	playing games during a 6 hour block at
9401000	9403000	night.
9403000	9405000	Anyhow, let's go to the phones.
9405000	9407000	It's ringing.
9407000	9409000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9409000	9411000	It's the one and only Ranma. Hey, Ranma.
9411000	9413000	How you doing?
9413000	9415000	I'm good, I'm good.
9415000	9417000	Did you know that smoking is bad for you?
9417000	9419000	Why, yes it is. That's why I
9419000	9421000	smoke other things, but that's not why I call.
9421000	9423000	An endorsement from Mr. Spanky.
9423000	9425000	Why did you call?
9425000	9427000	Put the coffee on.
9427000	9429000	You gotta talk.
9429000	9431000	I'll get the cheesecake.
9431000	9433000	Fabulous, darlin'. Fabulous.
9433000	9435000	What is up? What do you want to talk about?
9435000	9437000	Okay, I'm coming home on the train, and I
9437000	9439000	tune in right about time with you. Loki's talking about
9439000	9441000	piracy and everything, and
9441000	9443000	I
9443000	9445000	understand both sides of this,
9445000	9447000	because even in my world that I
9447000	9449000	cover, we have to deal with entitlement
9449000	9451000	kids who feel that they shouldn't have to pay for
9451000	9453000	anything because it's quote unquote free
9453000	9455000	and available, but when those series
9455000	9457000	are licensed, they don't want to pony
9457000	9459000	up the twenty or thirty bucks to buy
9459000	9461000	the entire series. And of course you're talking
9461000	9463000	about anime. Yes.
9463000	9465000	It's coming to another point, it's a financial
9465000	9467000	aspect because
9467000	9469000	truth be told, I don't, it's just me.
9469000	9471000	Nobody wants to drop three and four hundred
9471000	9473000	dollars on a new console,
9473000	9475000	knowing that the games are going to be
9475000	9477000	fifty, sixty, and seventy
9477000	9479000	dollars. So if there's a way to pirate
9479000	9481000	it, so be it.
9481000	9483000	And even if the game is like
9483000	9485000	five, six dollars, people are still
9485000	9487000	going to pirate it because that's five, six dollars
9487000	9489000	that they're going to keep and put towards something else.
9491000	9493000	Yeah, but the question is
9493000	9495000	if they were to put out a game, let's say
9495000	9497000	a game like, I don't know, Tomb Raider
9497000	9499000	since Jamie brought it up earlier in the show,
9499000	9501000	she got it on sale. If they were to
9501000	9503000	release Tomb Raider for five bucks,
9503000	9505000	you'd probably have a whole lot of
9505000	9507000	people jumping on that, but would it be
9507000	9509000	twelve times the amount of people
9509000	9511000	that would have bought it for sixty bucks?
9511000	9513000	I think more people would have bought it
9513000	9515000	at five bucks and at sixty.
9515000	9517000	That's what it's coming down to. More? But would it be
9517000	9519000	twelve times as many? Because that's how many,
9519000	9521000	it's got to be more than twelve times as many.
9521000	9523000	I really think it is because it's coming down
9523000	9525000	to where you got to be cost
9525000	9527000	consensus. I mean,
9527000	9529000	most, almost every single
9529000	9531000	PS3 360
9531000	9533000	game I own, I paid
9533000	9535000	anywhere between twenty and forty bucks.
9535000	9537000	One or two, I paid retail
9537000	9539000	price only because
9539000	9541000	it was a game that I wanted or I got a gift
9541000	9543000	card for it, done and done.
9545000	9547000	And as for,
9547000	9549000	you know, releasing the game on the
9549000	9551000	Pirate Bay, free like that,
9551000	9553000	see, there's one thing
9553000	9555000	about that, if
9555000	9557000	you see this game,
9557000	9559000	you're going to check the comments
9559000	9561000	within the first five or six comments,
9561000	9563000	somebody's going to be like, oh,
9563000	9565000	this game has a hack in it,
9565000	9567000	don't download, don't download, don't download.
9567000	9569000	Then you're going to go,
9569000	9571000	find another torrent where it's the full
9571000	9573000	game and you're going to grab that.
9573000	9575000	Well, what I
9575000	9577000	understand about this particular story
9577000	9579000	though is that the author
9579000	9581000	put it up and it was downloaded so many times so fast,
9581000	9583000	you don't figure out
9583000	9585000	what's going on until you've played the game for a
9585000	9587000	little bit. True.
9587000	9589000	Let's say, you know, like within an hour or
9589000	9591000	so, people are going to go back to that torrent and be like,
9591000	9593000	oh, don't download because
9593000	9595000	Yeah, but in an hour it's been downloaded five
9595000	9597000	thousand times already. And the sad part is
9597000	9599000	that that torrent is still going, but
9599000	9601000	if you're smart, you're going to stop that and just jump
9601000	9603000	onto something else. Right, right.
9603000	9605000	So, all
9605000	9607000	right, well, anything else you want to share with listeners
9607000	9609000	tonight?
9609000	9611000	No, not really.
9611000	9613000	I'm good. I just want to get
9613000	9615000	that off my chest and agree with y'all about this whole
9615000	9617000	piracy thing and
9617000	9619000	Where
9619000	9621000	can I come give you a hug at an anime
9621000	9623000	convention coming up soon?
9623000	9625000	Are you going to any anime conventions in the next
9625000	9627000	couple weeks? I will be kidnapping
9627000	9629000	the entire staff, putting them in
9629000	9631000	a Snakes box and dragging them to
9631000	9633000	anime next in June. Awesome.
9633000	9635000	I wish you were coming to Fanime. It would give
9635000	9637000	me a reason to go. I
9637000	9639000	know, but I have my own personal reasons
9639000	9641000	that I'm taking time off for the
9641000	9643000	sponsor. I know, I understand.
9643000	9645000	VXJ Snakes V is going to be there, so
9645000	9647000	I'm still
9647000	9649000	unpacking the shoebox studio, okay?
9649000	9651000	All right, fair enough, fair enough.
9652000	9654000	She'll do it anyway. All right.
9654000	9656000	Well, take care, Rama. Thanks for the call.
9656000	9658000	You got it, bro. All right, later.
9658000	9660000	1877 Game O L R, our username
9660000	9662000	on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
9662000	9664000	Also from
9664000	9666000	Tigerclaw, another tweet about Zone of the
9666000	9668000	Ender sequel on hold. The team
9668000	9670000	was disbanded due
9670000	9672000	to issues with the HD remake.
9672000	9674000	Did the zone get ended?
9674000	9676000	Yes, it was.
9676000	9678000	Oh, boy.
9678000	9680000	This is actually from Hideo Kojima himself
9680000	9682000	on Hideo Blog, the radio show
9682000	9684000	that he does online, his little podcast.
9684000	9686000	The proposed sequel
9686000	9688000	in Zone of the Enders was ceased,
9688000	9690000	and this was because the HD
9690000	9692000	collection issues were the reasons
9692000	9694000	behind the stop in development. I guess this
9694000	9696000	doesn't mean that it can't come back
9696000	9698000	later, but for right now,
9698000	9700000	nope.
9700000	9702000	Bummer.
9702000	9704000	Again, 1877
9704000	9706000	Game O L R, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
9706000	9708000	All one word.
9708000	9710000	Sj100matt tweeted
9710000	9712000	us something about Grant Kirkhope,
9712000	9714000	who's the composer of Perfect Dark,
9714000	9716000	and Banjo-Kazooie, I thought you mentioned this
9716000	9718000	earlier, offering their soundtracks up for
9718000	9720000	Pay Issue 1. Didn't we have that Perfect Dark story earlier?
9720000	9722000	Or did we
9722000	9724000	skip it tonight? Oh, I guess I didn't
9724000	9726000	show all that after all. Well, I was gonna cover
9726000	9728000	this, but apparently not. So you can check this
9728000	9730000	out, grantkirkhope.bandcamp.com
9730000	9732000	payissue1 for Perfect Dark
9732000	9734000	and Banjo-Kazooie. So if you,
9734000	9736000	Perfect Dark had a pretty good
9736000	9738000	soundtrack, at least, I know. I didn't play
9738000	9740000	a lot of Banjo-Kazooie, but I've played
9740000	9742000	a lot of Perfect Dark on 360.
9742000	9744000	With Sj100matt,
9744000	9746000	when he had this little trolling device that worked.
9746000	9748000	Redertainment wants to know
9748000	9750000	on Twitter, is there a reason the Christian right
9750000	9752000	hasn't flipped their shit about the various
9752000	9754000	religious comments in Bioshock Infinite?
9754000	9756000	Well, the
9756000	9758000	Westboro Baptist Church is getting ready to
9758000	9760000	protest that Slayer guy's funeral,
9760000	9762000	so that's probably what they're preoccupied
9762000	9764000	with doing. Which, by the way,
9764000	9766000	what a stupid idea.
9766000	9768000	What a stupid idea.
9768000	9770000	Well, I guess I should take a step back even
9770000	9772000	further. How unfortunate
9772000	9774000	that that guy passed away and what sounds like
9774000	9776000	what's really like a freak thing. Like,
9776000	9778000	you first hear that the guy dies of liver
9778000	9780000	failure and he can't help but think,
9780000	9782000	oh yeah, rock and roll lifestyle, right? Liver failure.
9782000	9784000	But it turns out he may have got like a spider bite
9784000	9786000	a couple years ago that led to this
9786000	9788000	because he didn't get a treat. Like, it's crazy stuff.
9788000	9790000	I don't know if you guys have read about it. Very sad stuff.
9790000	9792000	Obviously Slayer has these hardcore
9792000	9794000	fans that will carve the name
9794000	9796000	of the band into their various
9796000	9798000	pieces of flesh, and the
9798000	9800000	Westboro Baptist Church is
9800000	9802000	gonna go protest this guy's funeral.
9802000	9804000	Good
9804000	9806000	luck. You'll need it.
9806000	9808000	Ah, it's gonna be violent.
9808000	9810000	But nobody's gonna care.
9810000	9812000	That's gonna be the hilarious part.
9812000	9814000	So, um,
9814000	9816000	yeah, so screw the Westboro
9816000	9818000	Baptist Church. But anyway, back to the question that was really asked
9818000	9820000	by Redertainment. Is there a reason the Christian
9820000	9822000	right hasn't flipped their shit about the various
9822000	9824000	religious comments of Bioshock Infinite?
9824000	9826000	Bigger fish to fry right now? What do you think,
9826000	9828000	Loki? You've played Bioshock Infinite.
9828000	9830000	Why hasn't the religious right started complaining yet?
9830000	9832000	I don't know why they would complain about it.
9832000	9834000	I mean, it's just, it's fictional. I don't
9834000	9836000	really think it's gonna be,
9836000	9838000	I don't know. It's
9838000	9840000	not necessarily like saying religion's bad.
9840000	9842000	It's just they're extreme
9842000	9844000	in the scenarios of the game.
9844000	9846000	So, I don't know.
9846000	9848000	I don't know why they
9848000	9850000	would waste their time on that. I mean, they're not PETA.
9850000	9852000	I mean, I guess, you know, if animals are
9852000	9854000	getting hurt or something like that, then maybe, you know,
9854000	9856000	they'd come after them.
9856000	9858000	You know, for example, if that horse scene was still
9858000	9860000	there, maybe they would come after them.
9860000	9862000	I just, I just don't
9862000	9864000	think they care. Or they're aware of it. You know, they'll bring it
9864000	9866000	up later on. You know, like how they,
9866000	9868000	how those gun makers or whatever really
9868000	9870000	get pissed off at, oh, that postal game.
9870000	9872000	It's making people violent.
9872000	9874000	Yeah, wait, wait about ten years
9874000	9876000	and then they'll finally catch up and start complaining about it.
9876000	9878000	No Shock Infinite games. Like, what?
9878000	9880000	They're just now getting around, you know, Super Mario World.
9880000	9882000	Grand Theft Auto 3
9882000	9884000	is so violent.
9884000	9886000	Alright, I think that was it for
9886000	9888000	Twitter topics tonight. So, um,
9888000	9890000	actually, wait, I want to go back. I thought I saw stuff earlier
9890000	9892000	in the week. Let me go,
9892000	9894000	let me go to Loki and ask if
9894000	9896000	you have any last minute stories
9896000	9898000	first. There is a fan made
9898000	9900000	Duke Nukem Forever mod
9900000	9902000	being released for Duke Nukem 3D.
9902000	9904000	It's based off the original footage from
9904000	9906000	the 2001 E3 trailer.
9906000	9908000	And, uh,
9908000	9910000	you can download it for free
9910000	9912000	on moddb.com
9912000	9914000	slash mod slash duke
9914000	9916000	dash nukem dash forever.
9916000	9918000	And you just need a copy of
9918000	9920000	Duke Nukem 3D.
9920000	9922000	Can you play that on Steam yet?
9922000	9924000	multiplayer?
9924000	9926000	You can download it.
9926000	9928000	I'm waiting for that. I found the tweets
9928000	9930000	that I was looking for that I knew would come earlier
9930000	9932000	in the week. What are the tweets you're looking for?
9932000	9934000	Oh, there are all the tweets I'm looking for.
9934000	9936000	YYR tweeted us earlier in the week.
9936000	9938000	Now I'm drawing comparisons between the Wii U
9938000	9940000	and Dreamcast in my head.
9940000	9942000	Might make an interesting conversation topic for
9942000	9944000	OLR. Both were released way
9944000	9946000	ahead of the competition and had difficulty
9946000	9948000	garnering third-party support. But
9948000	9950000	compared to its eventual competition,
9950000	9952000	Dreamcast held up better muscle-wise
9952000	9954000	being comparable or even favorable
9954000	9956000	to PS2 in some ways.
9956000	9958000	Um, too soon to tell.
9958000	9960000	I get the comparisons with the whole fact that
9960000	9962000	but didn't they also not make Madden on the
9962000	9964000	Dreamcast or one of the big sports games didn't
9964000	9966000	didn't make its way over there. And that was
9966000	9968000	kind of the beginning of the end. But I think there was
9968000	9970000	a lot of other stuff that came into play too.
9970000	9972000	I don't even think it's necessarily comparable because
9972000	9974000	you know, spec-wise, I don't think
9974000	9976000	it's comparable at all with the next gen system.
9976000	9978000	I think it's more like the current gen stuff.
9978000	9980000	It's just kind of an in-between thing.
9980000	9982000	And yeah, it's their next
9982000	9984000	generation of that console.
9984000	9986000	But I wouldn't compare it to the next
9986000	9988000	gen gaming systems.
9988000	9990000	You're not going to be able to do what they do
9990000	9992000	on those systems on that system.
9992000	9994000	Well, last call for calls.
9994000	9996000	1877 Game O-L-R
9996000	9998000	or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
9998000	10000000	Loki, anything else?
10000000	10002000	Mega Man Limited looks
10002000	10004000	cool. They got a new trailer for it. It's
10004000	10006000	another fan-made game.
10006000	10008000	Maybe it'll get
10008000	10010000	shut down by Capcom.
10010000	10012000	Earthbound 4
10012000	10014000	apparently having a fan game.
10014000	10016000	The creator
10016000	10018000	said on Twitter this week, I want to say
10018000	10020000	I'm not doing it. Not happening.
10020000	10022000	Very difficult to happen, so
10022000	10024000	I kind of think you should never say
10024000	10026000	never, but
10026000	10028000	getting more games in the Mother
10028000	10030000	series. I guess I should say Earthbound 4.
10030000	10032000	It's technically Mother 4. Sorry. Sorry, Piras.
10032000	10034000	But Mother 4.
10034000	10036000	There you go. He could very well just put out an Earthbound game.
10036000	10038000	Exactly.
10038000	10040000	Gotcha!
10040000	10042000	I didn't see anything about Earthbound.
10042000	10044000	So.
10044000	10046000	Alright, well
10046000	10048000	I guess no other calls tonight.
10048000	10050000	Y'all have been shy lately. We barely got
10050000	10052000	any calls last week either.
10052000	10054000	What's up with that? It's the show where every gamer
10054000	10056000	has a voice if you use it.
10056000	10058000	Alright, I'll shut down
10058000	10060000	the Skype line for now. If you think of something later, you want
10060000	10062000	to send us your thoughts. Mailbag
10062000	10064000	at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or of course there's always Twitter.
10064000	10066000	We're afraid of the banana. We might stick a banana
10066000	10068000	with dreadlocks on them? Yeah. Well, I'm hoping the Skype
10068000	10070000	connection works. Maybe something's wrong there. I should've
10070000	10072000	tested it, but. Alright, anyhow.
10072000	10074000	Well, Rama got through it, so I know at least
10074000	10076000	one of it's working. Anything else,
10076000	10078000	Loki, you want to get out?
10078000	10080000	Nope. No?
10080000	10082000	Then I guess that brings us to the end of the show.
10082000	10084000	I guess so.
10084000	10086000	A little earlier than usual
10086000	10088000	tonight, but it's only supposed to be about a three hour show
10088000	10090000	with a break included, so that's alright.
10090000	10092000	I want to thank you guys for
10092000	10094000	tuning out tonight, or tuning out
10094000	10096000	turning out tonight and tuning in. You're welcome.
10096000	10098000	Now you can tune out.
10098000	10100000	Thank you guys very much for
10100000	10102000	tuning into the show and supporting our show.
10102000	10104000	If you like what you hear, don't forget to
10104000	10106000	support independent radio. You know, there's a lot of people
10106000	10108000	out there making podcasts
10108000	10110000	just because they have voices
10110000	10112000	they want to use and just trying to make
10112000	10114000	a name for themselves and they're not asking
10114000	10116000	for $35,000 of your money to make it happen.
10116000	10118000	Support indie podcasting
10118000	10120000	and help the community grow.
10120000	10122000	And if you want to help our podcast grow,
10122000	10124000	tell a friend or two about the show.
10124000	10126000	Leave a nice review on iTunes. Thumbs up on
10126000	10128000	Stitcher and listening time on there really
10128000	10130000	helps go a long way as well. Really, really
10130000	10132000	appreciate it. Before we close up shop tonight,
10132000	10134000	we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10134000	10136000	DarkSakura, we'll start with you. Your final thought.
10140000	10142000	Exclamation point. Loki, your final
10142000	10144000	thought tonight. Final thought is
10144000	10146000	I have a lot of
10146000	10148000	money to spend on Amazon soon
10148000	10150000	and I don't know what to get.
10150000	10152000	My final thought is I should have
10152000	10154000	made you buy me that IK that I spent $40
10154000	10156000	on this weekend. Fuck that, it's an IK.
10156000	10158000	Speaking of what IK, what they should do
10158000	10160000	is actually come out with some sort of pinball
10160000	10162000	version of it, you know, with Jesus Christ pinball
10162000	10164000	and have the flippers and stuff and have
10164000	10166000	a pinball game that supports it. Now you're talking
10166000	10168000	my language, yes sir. Love it.
10168000	10170000	I bet there's a pinball game that
10170000	10172000	supports IK though.
10172000	10174000	I would just go with PinMame and leave it at that, but
10174000	10176000	Why not? I'm surprised they don't have like
10176000	10178000	PinMame on the iPad somehow
10178000	10180000	even though, you know, the Apple
10180000	10182000	Gustavo locks everything down.
10182000	10184000	There is the whole
10184000	10186000	what is it just called pinball arcade?
10186000	10188000	I don't know, I've got it on here.
10188000	10190000	Yeah, pinball arcade, which is pretty good.
10190000	10192000	If it had IK'd support it would be awesome.
10192000	10194000	Be nice. Alright.
10194000	10196000	Well that's it guys.
10196000	10198000	We're done.
10198000	10200000	That's another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10200000	10202000	Thanks you guys. We'll be back to do it again
10202000	10204000	next week. Episode 504.
10204000	10206000	I'm hoping we'll have an interview next week so stay
10206000	10208000	tuned to Twitter. I'll tell you more about that as soon
10208000	10210000	as I have that confirmed for this week.
10210000	10212000	In the meantime, have fun gaming.
10212000	10214000	Thursday night, Forza Horizon, right?
10214000	10216000	Forza Horizon at 8 PM Pacific Standard Time.
10216000	10218000	And Mass Effect 3 at 5?
