14184	18971	Tonight, May 5th, 2013, one Wii U game finally goes free to play in the U.S.
19091	20012	Could more be coming?
20353	26461	The creators of Nyan Cat sue one video game maker, and could Respawn's next game be an Xbox exclusive?
31826	37270	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37330	45296	It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number 503 for May the 5th of 2013.
45397	47738	Happy Cinco de Mayo to you guys.
48259	53223	And on behalf of all Americans, I'd like to apologize to Mexico for Chevys.
54003	55885	Because what is, seriously, what is Chevys?
56345	56986	Delicious!
57846	59988	They have like the salad that I freaking like.
60428	62690	and that corn stuff that I'm allergic to, I freaking love.
62870	65032	So you shut your whore mouth.
65513	68055	The voice of reason over there telling me to shut my whore mouth.
68175	70597	The one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70978	72499	Rob's mouth is a dirty whore.
73580	80526	You know, people can take that a lot of different ways and I don't appreciate you slandering me on this program.
80566	82568	Your mouth is a freshly brushed whore.
83629	84830	What is that even supposed to mean?
84850	85570	It means it's clean.
85590	86131	You brush your teeth.
87435	91759	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, who I will not call names for one minute.
91919	98264	I think Reggie has sent you a secret Cinco de Mayo message because apparently your Wii is glowing.
98745	102308	Oh, that Wii has been glowing for like two weeks.
102668	104630	No, actually, not even that, about a week.
104850	115599	And honestly, my honest reaction when that thing started glowing blue, and I already know what the message is thanks to a news story coming up later, but when it started glowing blue, my honest reaction was, it was plugged in?
117881	119623	I swear to God, I was like, the Wii was plugged in.
119783	121345	I thought I unplugged it after I moved all that.
121365	123887	Well, because there's literally nothing left on my Wii.
124368	129153	I did the little Pikmin transfer thing to my Wii U because I wanted the discount on the virtual console games.
129513	133697	So there's no reason for me to have the Wii except to use what?
133758	134658	Forecast Channel?
135319	138542	and Spin the Globe and see what the weather's like in South Pole.
138762	140684	And then in June, they're pulling the plug on that.
140964	149451	So I won't even be able to see what the weather's like in the South Pole anymore unless I actually pull up an internet web browser and look at weather.com or whatever.
149471	151933	Rob, what do you have that I have in my hand right now?
152153	152934	You have an iPhone.
152954	153515	A microphone.
154656	154976	Bite me.
155316	161942	All you have to do is just put in Antarctica on your phone and hold on.
164870	169553	Siri, you whore, what is the temperature in Antarctica?
171354	172274	I'm gonna see if Siri will answer.
172915	174336	God, fucking Siri.
174516	176897	Yeah, yeah, how great, yeah, how fucking wonderful.
177297	177417	Oh!
177938	179819	I can't find things in Antarctica.
179999	181300	Can you be more specific?
181840	182681	Ha!
182721	183421	You bitch.
183581	186003	Yeah, that awesome device you have in your hand.
186343	188344	Yeah, technology, so great, isn't it?
192523	193943	The joys of live radio.
194183	195664	Yeah, no one can see me flip off, Rob.
195804	204106	Also say hello to our live audience and the ever-present fourth guest on our program, the chatterers, live.vognetwork.com.
204426	211347	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.
211727	214048	Once again, that's live.vognetwork.com.
214448	217729	Misty started us off tonight saying, fucking Siri indeed.
217969	218109	See?
219589	236823	There you go, all the VOG listeners hate Siri, confirmed Oh, I feel so bad for True, having your first car be an 84 Mustang, which is like one of the worst years for Mustangs TigerClaw on chat says, did you see this week's SNL's weekend update when they made fun of Google Glasses?
238244	239885	What do you think about that whole Google Glasses thing?
240586	244169	I think it's too expensive Yeah, do we know the price on those yet?
244551	247514	I wanna record everything I do Okay, we'll give you one for free
272901	275703	VXJSXV in chat says, Rob Roberts, you skipped Loki?
275783	276183	No, I didn't.
276264	277645	I said I would not make fun of him for a while.
277665	279686	Remember when I talked about the glowing light on the Wii?
279806	280467	Where were you?
280967	286572	Well, remember, Colorado did just recently legalize a little something something.
286672	287112	I'm kidding.
287152	288113	I know Jason's not into that.
289033	289394	Let's see.
290614	291575	What was the other comment?
291615	295297	Oh, SSJ100Matt says, Jamie just wishes Siri was more like Edie.
295697	296238	No, I do not.
296278	296618	True.
297018	297618	True facts.
297819	298719	She might not be Joker.
298819	305863	I want the Seth Green voice for my phone because that would be really... Actually, no, I want GLaDOS for my phone so that I can get directions while I'm being berated.
307444	309345	Can't you get like a GLaDOS GPS thing?
309485	310686	I think I saw that somewhere.
310706	311486	You know what else they have?
311506	320131	They have a Spongebob one and I went to a pinball event and the guy had one and I was like make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.
321906	322126	Number 1, 1226
338413	339033	63,000 people backed it.
339053	340574	Most of them backed it with getting a console.
340614	342175	So you were still one of the first few.
342215	343275	Yeah, it was the first day.
354901	358083	So you finally got your Ouya after waiting a couple weeks.
359064	360745	It took like a month.
360765	361886	They sent me a ship.
361926	366950	It was going to ship back in April.
366970	367310	I don't remember.
367330	368651	It was like the second week of April or something.
369111	370352	And it took like two weeks to get here.
371721	372141	Thanks for watching!
388267	395436	We were still playing games over in our game room, which is basically an empty half of a building that we don't use anymore.
395937	400102	So it's just me over there when I go to play games.
400382	406129	So I used two office chairs with that box and an Xbox 360 controller and leaned my phone against it.
406670	409374	I'm going to take a picture of it in comparison to the coffee cup.
424594	426575	Yeah, it's about the size of the coffee cup.
426655	427435	Actually, the coffee cup is bigger.
427455	428255	The coffee cup is bigger.
428635	430175	I'm going to put my iPad behind it.
430396	435557	Which shows you the priorities of our caffeine intake here at OLR.
435937	439438	So DarkSakura is going to take a picture for OrangeLunchRadio.com right now.
439458	440878	Does that go to Tumblr too when you do that?
441838	442339	It can.
442359	442499	Okay.
444284	451672	Yeah, so I got it and I did the firmware update that they had on there and started downloading games.
451692	458600	And then one of the first few days I started trying to sideload stuff because I wanted to see what exactly you could sideload on it.
459200	465047	It's weird because they don't really have a way to root it, although you're supposed to be able to root it straight out of the box and be able to do everything with it.
465407	466288	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
480427	481108	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
498932	502714	And then once you've done that, you set up your Wi-Fi.
502754	515723	If you don't have it hooked up to the Ethernet, so you set up your Wi-Fi, and then you either create an account or you log into an existing account with OUYA if you need to have it or not.
516183	519966	So I had an account already, so I logged into mine, and that's it.
520206	521067	And then you're greeted.
521127	527391	Well, I had to do a system update after that, so you do a system update, and then you go back to the main menu.
528031	530153	And then you have like four menu options you get to choose from.
530173	531574	They have one that's basically settings.
532455	534657	They call them all different things like manage or something.
535978	546206	They have a section that's make, which is basically all the sideloaded stuff for where if you're developing a game for OUYA, that's where you would dump your APKs and stuff and where you'd be able to play that stuff.
546546	549668	And then there's discover, which is their store.
550749	551450	They have that.
551750	553732	And then play, which is going to be all your games.
554252	556274	So I went to the store and just downloaded like...
556974	557294	Everything.
559016	559697	As much as I could.
560618	564482	And there's some stuff that I wanted to play since I'd seen video of it.
565162	571048	One of my first downloads was No Breaks of LA because I was like, this looked hilarious on the video when I saw it.
571248	572830	And yeah, it's pretty hilarious.
573010	574912	Is the Final Fantasy 3 on there yet?
575112	575952	I have Final Fantasy 3.
575992	576813	I have the demo for it.
577273	578374	I'm paying $15 for that.
578655	579956	I was just curious.
580016	581457	That's the thing, too.
581657	584699	Everything I've downloaded so far, I've not had to put any of my credit card information in yet.
584819	585180	That's good.
585400	587662	So you don't have to put it in until you want to actually buy something.
587682	595648	I think they changed that, too, in one of their very first... Remember, they had the whole rabble-rabble on the internet about that, and it changed pretty quick.
595828	602173	Yeah, and you can go in and change that stuff, and I think you can even remove it at any time or something.
602333	604058	So what about the hack-in and all this?
604198	606063	It's supposed to be this whole open thing.
606223	608348	Did you get in there and try to figure out?
608509	611015	Because the first question I asked you was, did you get the emulators working?
611624	612885	Oh, well, yeah, I have the emulator.
612946	621915	I mean, I have, I wasn't really, because of my, it's, it's emulators, so I haven't really bothered to, like, okay, I know what Mario Kart 64 looks like, you know, I'm not, I'm not in a huge hurry to put that on there yet.
621935	624478	Well, but sometimes, sometimes the emulators can be a little crappy.
624498	626120	Yeah, I do, well, I do want to play with it.
626200	632687	I mean, it's, it's, like, they have G, GSNES, which I, I recognize that as, like, you know, PC thing, and then
633067	636150	They have, I think, SNES 9X on there.
638572	640714	I don't remember what the Nintendo 64 one was.
640814	647140	And then they just added one for the DS, which I don't know how the hell that would work, but I guess it will.
647660	649302	And what else?
650563	652364	Some other cool things I found out about it.
652845	656208	You can sync Xbox 360 controllers and PlayStation 3 controllers to it.
656568	656908	Oh, nice.
657949	659571	Although I have not gotten that to work correctly.
660251	664055	I noticed the Ouya controller, you were letting me kind of get a feel for it.
664295	664976	It's not that bad.
664996	665376	It's not bad.
665396	669360	The only thing that bothers me a slight little bit is just the shoulder buttons.
669560	671722	The shoulder buttons just kind of feel weird because they're big and fat.
672442	696731	and so I'm just it's a little strange to me but you know they work so I don't know it'll be all right but all the like the directional buttons and like I'm not even really you know big deal about the letters being different on there it doesn't you know they're the same colors as the Xbox 360 stuff so I just go by color anyway so I'm like okay I mean you you pick it up in like a second and that's it it's
697031	697271	PS3, PS4, PS5
713471	715573	I can't get both of them synced.
715613	717034	I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.
717054	721478	Because when I try to sync a PS3 controller to it, my Ouya controller becomes unsynced.
721938	725601	And it's supposed to be able to just add it as a second controller, but I'm not doing something right.
725961	726782	I don't really know what it is.
727783	728523	That's not a big deal.
728543	731085	I mean, it's not something that's really officially supported anyway.
733147	737030	But, you know, games, I've checked out some of the games on there, and they're pretty cool.
737070	741774	I sideloaded Grand Theft Auto 3, which is... It works.
743475	755938	I haven't played 3 on my phone, so I don't know how... Actually, I did play 3 on my iPod one time, but then I was like, this is way too big and it doesn't work very well with the touch control, so I deleted it.
756118	761139	I asked about Final Fantasy 3 specifically because I've played the DS version of that.
761619	771481	I've emulated the NES one from way back in the day with the translation patch, but more recently I've played the iPhone, iPad version of it and the DS version, so I'm kind of curious how the Ouya one compares.
771621	772782	I'm sure it's probably the same.
772842	774624	I mean, it's probably going to be very similar.
774664	775605	Especially if it's Android.
775625	779990	I don't remember if Square released that on Android, but I wouldn't be surprised.
780010	781852	I think they probably... It wouldn't surprise me.
782733	784835	So I checked out... I've downloaded it.
784855	786096	I haven't gotten a chance to play it.
786116	788399	I played a game called The Ball, which is alright.
788459	791502	It's kind of like a first-person puzzle game, similar to like...
793063	796546	Portal or something like that, except without the portals.
796646	801710	I played a game called Phase, which is also a little similar to Portal.
802011	813420	You change the phase of your shield or whatever, and you can go between certain force fields, and if you have the opposite phase, those force fields are solid, so you have to
814120	816102	Play with that mechanic and stuff.
816722	823228	I played this Pengu poker game, which is something I'm probably reviewing soon.
823548	824709	And it's pretty fun.
824749	828231	It's kind of reminded me of... Oh, what was that?
828352	833756	There was like a poker RPG game that was on the iOS platforms.
833936	835037	I don't remember what that was called.
835097	840101	But Puzzle Poker... Swords and Poker, that's what it was.
840661	857491	and so I played that you used to love the hell out of that game on iOS Sword to Poker is fun see this is not necessarily like that it's not an RPG or anything it's basically a combination of poker and bingo so you're making hands based on like you have so many cards and so you're making hands based on the way you'd score in bingo
858179	865043	Clarify and comment from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com GameGuru says, Squeenix did release Final Fantasy 3 on the Amazon store, I believe.
865063	866344	That makes sense.
867304	867704	Why not?
867744	870126	If people are going to pay the $15 for it, go for it, right?
870166	872647	Yeah, I mean, I think they probably released it everywhere.
872867	877810	Okay, so to try and wrap up, because this is only a three-hour show, you paid, what, $100?
877890	879491	What was your donor level?
879571	882352	So you paid $99 for this a year ago.
882472	883193	Here's your Ouya.
883493	884073	How do you feel?
884413	884894	Worth it?
885974	886995	It's alright.
887175	887556	It's alright.
887836	888717	It's a little soon to tell.
888797	892961	I mean, it's kind of like a console that plays Xbox Live Indie games.
893181	894182	That's pretty much it.
894262	898246	I mean, they're going to have some exclusive stuff eventually, which is alright.
898326	900668	I mean, in some of it, it's kind of like, whoo!
900908	905469	With Microsoft clearly sunsetting that whole thing, unless we get surprised on the 24th.
905509	906909	With Microsoft clearly sunsetting.
906969	908250	That's a great vision for the console.
908270	908830	I just thought of something.
908930	909090	What?
909250	910310	What this reminds me of.
910610	910990	What the?
911310	913811	It reminds me of this looks-wise.
914091	916592	And I'm not saying this to insult the machine.
917252	927414	Aesthetically, it looks like those weird kind of blingy stuff that they give you at employee fairs when they open up your medical benefits and they try to give you stuff to advertise whatever the provider is.
927634	929195	I have no idea what you're talking about.
947901	974658	some other things about the console it doesn't just do games of course it does you know other applications I mean you can pretty much load anything you want on it it's got Twitch on there right now so you can actually view Twitch streams and stuff through that it's got it's got a I don't know if it's Stitcher some radio thing I don't actually listen to a lot but I know I recognize the app I just don't listen to any of these radio apps except for like Pandora but it's
974818	977839	It's got a radio app on there, a music thing.
978480	991365	And Minecraft worked great on it, except the controls don't work because right now they have the controls locked to just the... Well, the controller stuff, they have it locked to the Sony one that... What was it?
991425	993826	The... What the fuck is that called?
994146	998548	The Sony... Remember their stupid... Almost like the PSP phone, but it wasn't the phone?
999488	1000128	Oh, yeah.
1000669	1000849	The...
1002029	1004550	and Xperia Play.
1004950	1011451	So they have it locked to that and a future update is going to update it with controller support and I think it'll run.
1011671	1019493	But it runs smooth because it has a touchpad on the actual controller so you can use that to click the buttons a little bit.
1020074	1025395	And there's also other apps I can get where I can map stuff to the buttons but I haven't bothered to try that yet.
1025615	1031079	All right, so during the break tonight here in studio in about an hour, we're going to plug that in real quick because it's really easy to set up, right?
1031099	1033060	Yeah, it's just HDMI and a power cord.
1033120	1039564	All right, so we should be able to throw that in the TV real quick and during the break just kind of take a look at it because I'm dying to see what this is.
1039845	1042526	The retail release of this is in what, June, supposedly?
1042626	1045268	June 4th, supposedly, and they keep saying that they're not going to be late.
1045328	1048110	I think they're going to delay it, but right now they're saying June 4th.
1048510	1050211	Isn't that like right before E3?
1050692	1055375	It's an interesting time to... It is, but... That's so Saturn.
1056195	1060959	Well, the thing is, it's not something that really needs a huge fanfare because this is all a lot of these games.
1061019	1065042	I mean, everything's basically built by the community anyway.
1065102	1066123	It'll be interesting.
1066503	1067624	And there's stuff that they have.
1067644	1070006	They have MMOs that have been ported over from it and stuff.
1070386	1072368	So I can show you some of the apps on there.
1072548	1074029	And there's apps coming on there every day.
1075430	1075630	All right.
1075890	1076290	That'll be neat.
1076451	1079452	Well, you sound pretty enthusiastic about it, even though you just said you're on the fence.
1079512	1080532	I'm not that excited.
1080552	1081613	I mean, like, well, here's the thing.
1081653	1084474	I'm not that... Like, this isn't going to be something I'm going to be playing all the time.
1084514	1086395	It'll be something I'll go back to every now and then.
1086795	1092777	It's because now that I've gotten a little bit more comfortable with playing on PC with a lot of... Because I buy a lot of Steam crap.
1093077	1094838	I buy a lot of Steam crap.
1094958	1096199	You and everybody else.
1096219	1096579	Yeah, I know.
1096719	1098500	Loki, especially when it's sale time.
1098520	1101901	But I'm going in and actually starting to play a lot of that Steam crap that I bought.
1101981	1103402	So, you know...
1104002	1104282	I don't know.
1104422	1105423	There's stuff I like on there.
1105744	1108766	And so I'll try to play around with it.
1109547	1112249	Good question from True in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.
1112409	1114030	Does the Ouya not run hot?
1114551	1116032	No, they've got a big fan in the bottom.
1116052	1117573	There's actually like a fan vent in the bottom.
1117593	1118494	It's probably the heaviest part.
1118514	1119435	Well, yeah, they have it weighted.
1119615	1122898	They have it weighted on purpose so that it doesn't tip over when you plug the cords in the back.
1123018	1123678	Oh, smart.
1123919	1125380	Even though it, I mean, yeah, you...
1125840	1126440	DarkSakura.com
1149508	1150990	DarkSakura, we'll start with you
1166148	1169090	I'm doing a regular Mass Effect 3 stream on Thursday night.
1188379	1195827	I know this whole streaming game thing has been kind of growing over the past couple of years, but I really feel like in the past couple of months, it's exploded.
1196648	1198049	Everybody's doing game streams.
1198330	1204717	I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's just very interesting to me that it's become so easy and so many people are doing it.
1206038	1208279	All three of us have been doing game streams at certain times.
1208919	1209940	Bobby's been doing it.
1211261	1211961	Even our listeners.
1212181	1215804	I see a lot of the Twitter things like, come see my Twitch TV.
1216164	1216824	It's so easy.
1216904	1222168	It's not just gaming either because I've seen art streams.
1223088	1223969	Podcast recordings.
1224089	1226571	A lot of people who don't have a setup like the network or whatever do that.
1226711	1235677	When Depeche Mode's album was about to come out, my friend Amanda, who does a lot of stuff for their official fan club, got to preview the album on a live stream.
1236817	1241941	And we got to basically do a live stream preview of the new album, play all the music on it.
1241961	1242501	It was really good.
1243142	1243262	But...
1244102	1260745	but yeah I think I honestly think it's good because I mean the thing that I always like is if it's a game that I've seen you know 50,000 times I like seeing people kind of rip it apart sort of do the MST3K thing which is pretty much what I do when I go stream is yell at people in the game who can't hear me
1261409	1263571	Tiger Claw in chat says, yeah, which is why I love it.
1263651	1265512	So many games to watch people play.
1267293	1268154	And what was the comment?
1268214	1268454	Oh, yeah.
1268474	1273318	And Tiger Claw had started that off at our chat room saying, if only you could stream the Ouya on Twitch so we can see it.
1273698	1277561	I don't have the capture card for the TV yet, but that's on the list of want to get in future.
1277781	1279822	One of my buddies sent me a link to a good one that she uses.
1280082	1280363	Oh, nice.
1280563	1281383	So I'll send it to you.
1281483	1283725	I'm getting one event soon.
1284385	1286267	They'll do HDMI capture soon.
1287003	1290025	You guys missed a pretty good stream on I think it was Friday night.
1290405	1290986	Oh my gosh.
1291106	1292126	We were playing Mass Effect.
1292206	1293107	And he didn't invite me.
1293147	1294288	I had problems getting started.
1294548	1296889	Well, the whole thing was that Shane was going to get drunk.
1297570	1299671	And it took him about 20 minutes.
1300571	1301872	The stream lasted an hour.
1302313	1303353	I mean, he passed out.
1303653	1303834	Wow.
1304014	1305114	But it was pretty funny.
1306355	1307796	So there was a few that were there and got to see it.
1307816	1309237	So we need to do Wednesday Night Multiplayer.
1309997	1310517	We'll see.
1310537	1313978	We've got to dance around all the live shows on the stream.
1314458	1315799	So can I continue?
1315859	1316439	Yes, I'm sorry.
1316479	1319040	I just want to talk about... I'm trying to promote your streaming site.
1319100	1319940	Poor Shane.
1320960	1321680	Whatever.
1325041	1335704	But yeah, I've started doing that just because I don't... I get bored and usually... Sometimes it's Dan's day off, but a lot of times he'll have a Wednesday where he works late.
1336337	1337979	So, you know, I'm there by myself.
1338079	1339180	What's the problem?
1339220	1342303	I'll hop on and chat with people and yell at video games.
1345447	1347689	Then we got an iCade.
1348650	1350392	Dan, and I saw you ordered yours.
1351413	1354036	Dan ordered an iCade because Amazon has them for $44.
1355297	1357199	And we're talking about marked down by about $100.
1359355	1375469	so I went on a purchasing rampage trying to buy games that would work on it because I had none and it was pretty stupid of me because I spent like the last of my play cash on going to the baseball game last night too which was really good
1376061	1392810	But I got Pac-Man, the Atari's Greatest Hits I already had Fixed at Felix, but I can't figure out how to get it to work Metal Slug 3, the Midway Arcade, Blazing Star, and the Namco Arcade So I bought one game on the Namco Arcade, which was Galaga I tried playing Starblade with the arcade, and Starblade doesn't work
1393931	1401397	A lot of these will have a one-day demo thing that you can play through unless you buy tokens or the full version of the game.
1402038	1405501	And for most of these, the full version of the game is like a couple bucks.
1406882	1407883	Metal Slug 3 was about $5.
1408584	1409164	It was worth it.
1409484	1413268	I thought of another game that I think supports IK that you might not have.
1413308	1414749	It's the Activision Collection.
1415490	1417612	And I think Kaboom is free on that.
1417832	1418352	I don't remember.
1418412	1419754	One of the games is free that you get with that.
1419814	1419994	Yeah.
1420310	1421211	I've got plenty right now.
1422393	1424596	When you told me the iKids were on sale, ordered one.
1424836	1425316	Yeah.
1425337	1426358	So I'm getting it Monday.
1426678	1427479	So I'm excited.
1428541	1435730	Because I grabbed an app in the marketplace called Gridly a couple months ago, which is just the main emulator in disguise.
1436170	1439973	And I know a lot of you guys are like, but emulators are bad.
1440553	1442414	But I support the real deals too.
1442955	1447177	But since there aren't a lot of real deals on iOS for these things, I can't wait.
1447878	1452461	My cocktail cabinet with bar top is just collecting dust at my work.
1453341	1457104	Let's be real guys, are they ever going to put out Miss Nude World 96 as an app?
1457324	1457844	I doubt it.
1457864	1460246	It has Miss Nude World 96 on it too.
1462107	1466050	The only way I will ever get to play Miss Nude World 96 is to turn to the dark side.
1466110	1466570	Sorry, Jamie.
1468231	1468471	Okay.
1470873	1473975	So, I actually, I'm probably going to be canceling WoW.
1475876	1485363	because unless these bastards don't ever get back to me because I've been trying and trying and trying Ragnarok Online 2 went into free to play
1486107	1487989	I saw that and I thought of you this week on Steam.
1488049	1488830	So I tried.
1489731	1495176	And I had registered through whatever Gravity's new site is for it.
1495576	1497698	And so now I can't register it through Steam.
1498239	1507027	And in the same freaking problem that it had back with the old IRO was that you can't find the...
1507828	1536669	installer anywhere and I tried to download from like one of their mirrors and it kept quitting on me so I'm like I could download the Steam one fine but I couldn't run it and so it says if you have problems email blah blah blah I'm like not replying to me yet so I don't know what to do so I'm really supremely pissed and I still need to update my PSO2 God I played something else I don't remember alright seriously then we'll go over to Loki Loki how was your gaming week
1537957	1538958	I played a few things.
1539799	1545443	I finally installed Grand Theft Auto San... Well, I tried installing Ted Reyes on there.
1546864	1554069	And I got it to work, but mapping the buttons to the Xbox 360 controller are... It's pretty much impossible to get it to work correctly.
1554929	1556470	So I kind of gave up on that.
1556650	1560553	I'm still trying to get my copy back from my sister, but she put it in storage.
1562034	1563134	So I have to get it.
1563254	1565755	What was she thinking putting your game in storage?
1566396	1568016	I basically gave her the PlayStation 2.
1568376	1570257	I guess siblings can get away with that a little more.
1570277	1570537	That's fine.
1570577	1571997	I'm not in a huge hurry to play Zandris.
1572038	1572698	I've already played it.
1572718	1578420	I just wanted to play it on PC because I have it on PC, but I can't map the buttons correctly.
1578660	1582141	They have a program to do it, but it doesn't work right, and you have to unpatch the game.
1582181	1585302	It's just a pain in the ass, so I'm just not worrying about that.
1585322	1587923	I got four episodes from Liberty City on there.
1588163	1588923	I played it for a little bit.
1588943	1593964	I'm like, cool, I'm going to play episodes from Liberty City and I'm going to play Deathmatch and I'm going to totally dominate Deathmatch.
1594024	1596645	And there's no one on fucking line anymore.
1596885	1601886	There's nobody, nobody at all playing any sort of ranked Deathmatch or Deathmatch or anything.
1602066	1603806	It's all fucking free mode.
1605126	1612008	Free mode's fun, but I want to play a competitive game in Grand Theft Auto and I can't do that anymore because no one plays it.
1612608	1638256	which is why I need Grand Theft Auto V and it's such a fucking cock tease to have three fucking trailers and extended previews all over the goddamn internet I need this game, it's my crack I'm fiending for this game so yeah, Grand Theft Auto V is going to be awesome I can't wait to play it I guess I don't even need to ask about those trailers that came out this week and how you felt because I think you made it pretty clear
1638896	1639537	It's fantastic.
1639577	1665954	Well, even there was like a 90-minute kind of talking about it because basically everyone was shown like about 30 minutes of gameplay that talked everything about from the mechanic between switching between each protagonist in the game and how they're, you know, the map is about five times the size of Red Dead Redemption, one and a half times of Red Dead Redemption's worth in the ocean.
1666554	1689479	under the ocean actually so there's a lot of scuba diving in the game um you can pretty much do whatever i mean you can do whatever you want in the game but it's just so much to explore it's just gonna it's gonna be awesome um and just a lot of mechanics in the game sound really good like the heists and how you have to do missions to kind of do recon on different things and set up the actual heists and you hire your people to help you out and
1691232	1692773	It just looks like a very good game.
1693133	1696214	And a very good storyline going along with that.
1696514	1697154	Actual games to play.
1697174	1702876	Saints Row III, I'm still trying to go through and finish off my achievements that don't involve co-op.
1703317	1709399	But I'm just getting so bored with a lot of these games that I don't know what I want to play anymore.
1709419	1712880	Because I can't think of anything that I want to play that sounds exciting.
1713120	1718662	You know, like Grand Theft Auto V. I can't think of anything other than Saints Row IV and Grand Theft Auto V and maybe Earth Defense Force 2025.
1718722	1718803	But...
1720323	1721464	None of those are coming out yet.
1722004	1726888	So I'm kind of in this weird position where I'm just kind of going on autopilot and playing stuff.
1728502	1730963	I don't really want to play, but I'm kind of playing it anyways.
1751234	1753757	The Cars Don't Realize That The Bridge Was Up
1768709	1775950	That almost inspired me to even bring my singing voice and do a Buggy Saints Row the Third.
1776630	1778571	That is begging for the Benny Hill theme.
1778751	1781411	It's just seriously like, what?
1781791	1782732	This is so terrible.
1782952	1785172	There's even a mission I had to do where I had to stop this.
1785312	1786632	Basically, it's an assassination mission.
1786652	1788853	You have to kill this guy before he kills him.
1788973	1791233	He's going to commit suicide by jumping off the bridge.
1791593	1796434	And so she needs to collect the money, insurance money, but it's null and void if he commits suicide.
1796914	1797394	Thanks for watching!
1816929	1817710	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1840012	1842133	My safe house and just starts shooting at me.
1842153	1844734	I'm like, how the fuck did this guy even get here in the first place?
1844774	1848096	He's not even supposed to be coming after me yet because I don't have the right outfit on.
1848116	1849196	I haven't even found this guy.
1849356	1850157	It's just ridiculous.
1850597	1856199	You know, I know people have their opinions on you and your strong opinions about Nintendo and other things.
1856299	1862182	But, you know, it's amazing to me how when you really like a game, you will make that game last forever.
1862942	1865263	I've bought it on two platforms already.
1865283	1865964	That's great.
1866004	1866544	So I've
1868234	1868995	I don't know.
1869175	1874318	So anyways, and then beyond that, Ouya, I played lots of games on the Ouya, and we talked about a lot of those already.
1875278	1878140	And what else did I play this week?
1878540	1879501	More Call of Duty.
1879981	1883963	I actually am playing through a little bit more of the story campaign on 3, which is, it's alright.
1884404	1885744	It's just, it's Call of Duty.
1886525	1888366	They don't have a great story.
1888426	1889927	I mean, it's cinematic.
1889987	1890587	It's kind of fun.
1890627	1892108	You don't play Call of Duty for the story.
1892188	1893109	No, you don't really.
1893309	1894169	You don't really play for the story.
1894189	1894870	You play for the action.
1894910	1896191	It's just watching like an action movie.
1896211	1896571	I mean, come on.
1897371	1901452	and MinecraftXPLA because we did a VOG gaming night.
1901553	1902833	Actually had someone show up this time.
1902873	1903913	Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.
1904393	1904874	That's all right.
1905114	1905614	It's all good.
1905814	1908795	I really wanted to go, but I had to work on one of my other projects that night.
1908855	1909355	It's all good.
1909375	1910395	But you're doing Forza this week, right?
1910415	1911716	This week we're doing Forza Horizon.
1911736	1912036	I will be there.
1912056	1913276	So hopefully that will bring out more people.
1913517	1913937	I'll be there.
1914217	1916137	Forza Horizon this Thursday, 8 p.m.
1916157	1916958	Pacific time.
1917018	1918078	Probably goes for about two hours.
1918558	1920099	So at least that's how long I can play.
1921179	1921640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1935758	1939800	Laura Croft's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Good times with it?
1959366	1960948	Death isn't super frustrating in that game.
1977621	1980063	and it starts you pretty much right from the section you left off on.
1980243	1980443	Right.
1980463	1983206	But I need to find the picture on my Tumblr and post it in chat for everybody.
1983566	1983966	Sounds good.
1984067	1986409	Live.VogNetwork.com My Gaming Week.
1986429	1989071	I'll try to be kind of quick here because I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
1989111	1991453	In fact, I spent a lot of time playing some old stuff.
1991613	1993875	A virtual console on Wii U. Go figure.
1993955	1994055	I've...
1994976	1997317	Actually bought a lot of stuff on it.
1997437	1998758	I'm kind of embarrassed to say.
1999238	2001879	But Mega Man, the old school Mega Man came out this week.
2001939	2003940	And how could I not?
2004020	2006961	The Mega Man games have some of the best soundtracks.
2007781	2009662	So I had to check it out on Virtual Console.
2009762	2015664	And I'm loving the whole restore points are a godsend in stages like Iceman's stage.
2015744	2020306	That stage can go to hell for those blocks that appear and disappear.
2020766	2023787	But yeah, I've been having a good time with that.
2024908	2031510	Otherwise, there's another game, but DarkSakura's going to bring it up later in the show, so I'll wait to get my comments on that until later.
2033251	2042995	And, oh, I was on Steam randomly last night, and I was looking at the free-to-play games, and I was going to do Ragnarok Online 2, but I decided instead to play Puzzle Pirates.
2043175	2044316	Remember Puzzle Pirates?
2044436	2045596	I saw that the other day.
2045636	2047397	I'm like, oh, that's on Steam?
2047417	2047497	Yeah.
2047677	2048518	Yeah, I know, right?
2048538	2048858	Sweet.
2049018	2050480	I was like, God, that took me back.
2050540	2051701	That was like, we all played that.
2051981	2055665	Like, that's what we used to play when we were all playing DDR regularly.
2055725	2057207	Like, a ton of us were playing Puzzle Pirates.
2057247	2058188	I remember, like, Irene got us all into that.
2058208	2058848	I didn't play it at the time.
2059429	2062112	But I think I was actually, during those days, I was playing Ragnarok Online on...
2062805	2081225	and it's the bilging is still the same freaking thing with the match but they've added a lot to it like you have rooms you customize and it's definitely like a game that they put out there for more lower-end PCs you could probably play puzzle pirates just fine on like a netbook like is that kind of game so yeah I was that was kind of fun to just kind of get back into that again
2081605	2090131	Otherwise, World of Warcraft, Mass Effect 3, a lot of the usual suspects, and another game that I'm going to be reviewing on VOG soon, so stay tuned for that.
2091292	2094554	Okay, let's get into some gaming news.
2094734	2097196	Quick, plugs for the Twitters, the Facebooks, and all that.
2097276	2099717	Twitter.com slash OLRs, where you can follow us on Twitter.
2100057	2102259	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2102839	2105121	And I don't really have a whole lot else to add.
2105181	2107262	We may not be here Memorial Day weekend.
2107442	2111145	I may be gone, but we'll let you know in the next couple weeks.
2111765	2114286	So stay tuned for all that live programming information.
2115006	2116186	Alright, let's talk about the gaming news.
2116426	2117266	Loki, start us off tonight.
2117526	2120767	Okay, so apparently the Wii U has now been hacked.
2120787	2137471	Or at least the mod chip creators behind the Wii Key they have now said that they've claimed to, I guess, compromise Wii U security and completely reverse the Wii U drive authentication, disk encryption file system, and everything else.
2140072	2140332	And
2141272	2162665	Yeah, and I guess what's supposed to come of this is that they're going to either create a replacement optical drive that'll go into your Wii U, or they're going to create some sort of... Like, I've seen this before with some of the Xbox 360 drives, where they'll have a daughter board or something like that that replaces a board on there, and you can just kind of hook in the ribbon cables, and it's a bypass or something.
2163065	2164326	So they'll have something like that.
2164886	2168969	And the Wii key... Actually, the Wii key, I want to say... No, that's not the mod chip I have in my Wii.
2169049	2169629	I actually have a...
2171491	2172973	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2187052	2189233	And kind of show, I guess, how serious that this is.
2189333	2192555	They've also dumped their first game, Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth.
2192715	2194616	One of the probably most terrible games out there.
2195197	2208605	But they have dumped it and it's... Well, somebody's dumped it and it's been released out there on the internet to download and do nothing with because there's no such mod ship to play it on yet.
2209725	2209865	But...
2211306	2212787	Yeah, Nintendo is aware of it.
2212947	2225036	They say that they're going to find a way to bypass everything, but thus begins the back and forth struggle that is hacking and patching, more hacking and more patching, so on and so forth.
2225096	2229739	And so far, there's really no homebrew needs of this.
2230139	2233682	I guess maybe you can make your own software for the Wii U, but this is mainly piracy.
2235205	2236005	Hacker's gonna hack.
2236066	2238247	Or backups, I guess, if you will.
2238787	2239167	Yeah, sure.
2240388	2244910	Okay, so I think the real question to ask here, though, is how hard is this to pull off?
2244970	2247852	Because the harder it is, the less impact this is gonna have.
2247952	2255396	We know that the pirates and the people that are all about wanting to steal games as much as they... Oh, excuse me, make backups as fast as they can.
2255416	2256817	They're always gonna find a way in.
2257077	2260679	But the question is, how easy is it for somebody else...
2261219	2263601	This is going to be like a mod chip.
2263641	2270045	So you're going to have to buy a mod chip, you're going to have to install the mod chip onto your system or install some sort of part on your system.
2270485	2279391	This isn't like the Wii Homebrew channel where it was a hack that modified your dashboard to run a program that you could then run games off a hard drive.
2279431	2280472	It's not that simple.
2280932	2282113	You have to buy a mod chip.
2282213	2286354	Can Nintendo brick your console with a firmware update if you were running this?
2286834	2288315	They may threaten to do that.
2288395	2289335	I don't know if they can.
2290155	2295737	There's drive emulators and stuff like that that are already out there.
2295757	2297958	Why don't they do it?
2299338	2301779	My point is, why would Nintendo play softball with this?
2302299	2302419	Why?
2302960	2306502	Because of false positives is what it is.
2306562	2316749	Because if you have someone that legitimately hasn't done anything and you fuck their console up, they're already in not a very strong position with their console to piss people off like that.
2317049	2324454	Also, they're probably going to let this thing get released, get people to buy the console because they're like, oh, I'm going to hack all this stuff up and then patch it.
2324634	2325735	Okay, okay.
2327133	2328234	That's, okay, that's smart.
2328394	2329815	I mean, that's what I would think that they would do.
2329855	2336080	I mean, I'm sure at the same... How many people went and got a PSP the day they heard that NES emulators are runnable on it?
2336100	2343565	Well, and then, well, on top of that, though, they're probably going to be, you know, prompted if this does come out, you know, pretty widespread.
2343725	2351131	They're going to be prompted by their third-party developers that, hey, we need you to fix this because we're not making a lot off of these Wii games already.
2351451	2356575	And if we're making even less now because people are pirating them, you know, it's going to be a tough thing.
2356995	2360539	And also, I mean, here's the other thing you gotta consider too.
2361140	2368708	These aren't necessarily DVDs that they're running on anymore, so you're gonna have to have a Blu-ray burner and Blu-ray media to do that.
2369729	2370690	I think that stuff's coming down.
2370730	2371791	That stuff's coming way down.
2371831	2375395	We're only a couple years away from that being standard, really, for PCs.
2375868	2391994	But, I mean, if anything, I could see them go on the route of, like, the X-Key or something, where it's basically a drive, a middle, you know, kind of in the middle board that allows you to run, it'll emulate the drive, and you'll run stuff off a hard drive.
2392395	2395476	It's gonna be easy like that, is the way I see it, that they're gonna do it.
2396036	2398617	But right now, I mean, it's progress, I guess.
2398878	2406401	But if they've completely reversed the file system and stuff, who's to say that they can't come up with their own, like, modified dashboard that'd run on there?
2406421	2410643	Because if they've figured out how to, you know, do the file system stuff and then the keys for that.
2410723	2414945	Well, and the hacking community is going to have an interesting case to make, too.
2415165	2417487	You know, I understand why they wanted to do Homebroom Channel.
2417827	2418267	Homebroom?
2418647	2435425	Homebrew channel on Wii because there wasn't a lot of indie friendly stuff on the Wii but Wii U is really trying to make a case like we are the indie friendly platform you've even heard the indie developers come out and say yeah like Wii U is gonna like I know this is gonna shock people but Nintendo's the platform to be on right now if you're indie
2436238	2443843	So does the hacking community have as much of a case when it seems like Nintendo is really embracing a lot of the homebrew stuff open arms?
2444264	2458554	Well, I shouldn't say homebrew, but indie stuff open arms, thus negating the need for a homebrew channel that is totally clean and without piracy.
2458694	2463738	I mean, I don't think that they're really going to... It's just one hacking group doing something, and that's it.
2464158	2465499	So you're going to have people that want to...
2466099	2469361	They're in the business of selling mod chips, so they're going to want to make a mod chip to sell.
2469562	2471203	And Wii U is just the console of the moment.
2471283	2473664	I mean, as soon as PlayStation 4 is out, they'll be working on that too.
2473904	2474725	Of course, yeah.
2475345	2475586	All right.
2476066	2483171	Well, Loki alluded to this a minute ago, and I was mentioning this earlier in the show when they were teasing me about the Wii message light being on.
2483491	2489495	But Nintendo actually sent a message to all the Wii owners this week saying, hey, have you checked out the Wii U?
2490035	2492957	So it seems odd to me that it took them this long to do it.
2493277	2495359	But they did send a message to everybody that says, quote,
2496099	2499882	Did you know that you can play nearly all of your existing Wii games on Wii U?
2500383	2505527	I thought you could play every Wii game on Wii U. Why did they say nearly all?
2505847	2508969	I think they're counting like, you know, maybe Virtual Console and stuff.
2509029	2511371	Is there some stuff that you can't quite port over?
2511511	2512792	Maybe there was something that didn't transfer over.
2512812	2514894	Maybe it's just something to save their ass if something doesn't work.
2515855	2516295	It's possible.
2516455	2517156	Maybe, yeah, it's true.
2517717	2526246	Your Wii controllers and many Wii accessories can also be used with the new Wii U console, along with any downloaded games, save data, and other info stored in your existing Wii console.
2526687	2529009	Wii U is the all-new home console from Nintendo.
2529149	2530551	It's not just an upgrade.
2531251	2536137	It's an entirely new system that will change the way you and your family experience games and entertainment.
2537093	2538113	Do you hear that, Jimmy Fallon?
2538153	2539273	It's not just an upgrade.
2539673	2541454	That's a big problem, though.
2541914	2542694	I mean, think about it.
2542874	2547875	If they have to go out there and tell people, hey, guys, it's not just a peripheral.
2547975	2548615	It's an upgrade.
2550335	2552616	They've done a poor job marketing it, then.
2553176	2558537	Well, that and maybe this is a case now where the name issue is finally biting Nintendo.
2558597	2563237	I think a lot of people razzed them for the Wii name, and that ended up working.
2563377	2563878	It didn't matter.
2563898	2564818	Nintendo did great with that.
2564838	2566058	But this whole Wii U name...
2567078	2573021	I think maybe Nintendo's wondering, I don't know if they are, but I think a lot of people are going, maybe that really wasn't the best name.
2573182	2579745	They should have started off calling it the U. Or, well, Super Wii, which isn't that what they call it in Japan?
2580425	2581906	Something that translates to Super Wii?
2581926	2582947	Something like that?
2583687	2589951	So, I mean, yeah, Koopa Kid Jeremy in our chat right there says, this just proves they should have called it something else.
2590911	2591191	Mm-hmm.
2592072	2592252	Agree.
2594417	2611366	Anyhow, what I think is interesting about this also, Iwata, Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata, said in a financial results briefing last week that, quote, we have not been able to solidly communicate the product value of Wii U to our consumers yet, which has been a grand challenge for us.
2611747	2619611	Some have the misunderstanding that Wii U is just Wii with a pad for games, and others even consider Wii U GamePad as a peripheral device connectable to Wii.
2619991	2623173	We feel deeply responsible for not having tried hard enough...
2623573	2625434	to have consumers understand the product.
2625774	2628255	Have they done the commercial onslaught that they did with Wii?
2628355	2631415	Like, I remember all those commercials, Wii would like to play, and that whole thing.
2631516	2632836	That was a pretty good marketing plan.
2633036	2635097	Do they do that at all?
2635217	2638898	They have a new marketing campaign going on right now that's really dumb.
2638958	2651902	It's basically these families coming in, and they're like bussing them in by, or vanning them in, whatever, taking them by a van, and bring them to Nintendo headquarters to try the Wii U out for the first time, and
2652262	2653783	And they're like, oh my god!
2653843	2656043	Nintendo stuff is so awesome!
2656083	2657424	This is the best thing ever!
2658084	2661305	Oh, this gamepad is so amazing!
2661405	2662985	This is gonna change it all!
2663426	2670348	It's just like, seriously, just wanna... Okay, if Nintendo really wants to get their message across about the Wii U, here's what they need to do.
2670808	2676910	They're gonna need to release a Mario soccer game this Christmas, and they need to take it out across America...
2677310	2688436	to all the little peewee soccer championships so all their target audience, the moms and dads of the soccer kids can play Mario soccer and then they can all gossip amongst themselves and get the word out.
2688776	2690937	That's how Nintendo reaches their core audience, right?
2691337	2691998	Soccer games.
2693198	2693298	Eh?
2693999	2694459	Bowling!
2695936	2705083	The problem is you had people that were really excited about the Wii, like myself, and bought it because it was a very innovative product at the time.
2705163	2709207	Granted, we wish it was kind of like graphics of the Xbox 360 and PS3.
2709407	2710608	I was in it for the donuts.
2712089	2716873	And so you bought it, and then you're like, hmm, I'm not playing anything on it.
2717653	2718954	I bought these Mario games.
2719986	2720467	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2741597	2743178	Game's a game in this case, yes.
2743459	2744660	Yeah, it's fantastic.
2744720	2748623	And when you know, the developers are so behind, you know, the Wii and stuff.
2748683	2753767	In fact, they thought it was so great that they decided, hey, EA said, hey, you know what?
2754067	2756509	We're going to put out FIFA on this system every year.
2757089	2761052	Oh, it's not going to be a different FIFA, but it'll be the same FIFA every year.
2762433	2764015	Because, you know, we don't want to put any money into it.
2764055	2764695	That's different.
2764755	2766757	You can't blame Nintendo for what EA did.
2767389	2770438	Okay, Konami decided, hey, you know what, we're gonna do Pro Evo.
2770458	2771561	You can't blame him for that either.
2771601	2772664	What is it with soccer games?
2772724	2773447	I mean, seriously.
2776095	2782058	That would be like me blaming Microsoft for all those terrible rehashes in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade.
2782458	2783338	That wasn't Microsoft's fault.
2783358	2784859	Can you blame them for all the shovelware on the Wii?
2785859	2787820	No, no.
2788220	2798925	I'm just saying there wasn't... The Wii U, the step from the Wii or like, you know, previous generation, the GameCube to the Wii, there was a big jump as far as gameplay innovation, stuff like that.
2799725	2800285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2822533	2823795	Nintendo Land was not Wii Sports
2840074	2843776	Nintendo Land wasn't Wii Sports, and I don't think it was a system seller.
2844116	2845477	A big, big chunk of people.
2845497	2848599	I feel like this is a very deja vu conversation, so we need to move on here a minute.
2848619	2850620	It was like Wii Sports Nintendo version or something.
2850700	2853881	So many people that bought the Wii were not buying the Wii.
2854262	2855222	They were not buying the Wii.
2855242	2858144	They were buying Wii Sports and the console that came with it.
2858724	2860525	That was a big chunk of people that bought the Wii.
2862054	2862654	Thanks for watching!
2879484	2903324	and you know I would bowl like I would bowl you know it was very natural for people but then going to Nintendo Land it's like well it's not that different well this is kind of similar what I've already done in the Wii but why do I need to spend the extra money to play this game that's very similar to what I already have that's the problem it wasn't just it wasn't a big hook that got people in that gamepad was not enough hook to get people onto the system
2903672	2908674	Maybe if they'd put out a game, like, you know, the thing about Wii Sports is that everybody generally knows those sports.
2908714	2909554	Everybody knows bowling.
2911015	2918337	Specifically within Wii Sports, that bowling minigame, maybe the tennis to an extent too, but those two games specifically were just huge.
2918818	2922319	And maybe Nintendo Wii U needed something, it needed that.
2923039	2928744	for, or still needs, still come out this Christmas, needs something like that that everybody just knows.
2928904	2934409	You know bowling, you know, but you don't necessarily know Donkey Kong Crash Course or F-Zero.
2934429	2935770	You don't necessarily know that stuff.
2936390	2940594	I don't know why, but my mind goes to like maybe a board game or a card game thing.
2941034	2944878	Especially if you could like play it online or something, but that would require Nintendo to...
2945458	2953134	The problem is, for the Wii U, I think what they would need to have done is done something completely different than the Wii.
2953275	2953415	Like,
2954818	2955218	I don't know.
2955318	2957760	Come up with... I can't really think of what they would have to do.
2957940	2958260	Here you go.
2958300	2961182	TigerClaw says, Too bad Wii Sports didn't have online multiplayer.
2961222	2962723	Sucks playing by yourself against the computer.
2962823	2963184	Kabam.
2963604	2965585	Wii Sports 2 online.
2965705	2970889	But the thing with the Wii though, what they're pushing though is that it's a family party atmosphere is what it is.
2971209	2973430	But that's not the dynamic anymore.
2973470	2975452	That used to be the dynamic when it was like...
2976132	2976952	Thanks for watching!
2997037	2997438	That's true.
2997538	3001482	I probably do more gaming with Shane in Kansas than anybody else.
3001562	3002002	Exactly.
3002102	3004304	Like distance isn't a thing anymore, really.
3004384	3010250	I mean, you talk to people, you probably talk to people more that are like further away than you do like your neighbors and stuff.
3010290	3011611	So it's not the thing.
3011691	3012192	And that's the thing.
3012672	3017936	Like, I don't, like the Wii, you know, it was kind of fun playing the Wii stuff, but it was all party game stuff.
3018257	3021900	And I can't see myself getting the Wii U because, hey, now five people could play.
3022140	3022420	Cool.
3022500	3024382	I don't have five people in my house ever.
3024662	3024822	Okay.
3025222	3029265	YYR with a valid counter statement in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
3029566	3033289	The audience for Wii Sports probably didn't care that much about online play.
3034813	3040238	True, but hear me out here a minute, YYR, because you have that camera on every Wii U console.
3040859	3049027	What if Grandma could play bowling with her grandkids, thanks to the internet technology, and every Wii U could have Skype built in?
3049047	3049448	It would be awesome.
3049548	3056555	That would be amazing, but Nintendo's sitting on that goldmine, and that's not what they want to do, for some reason.
3056795	3058015	Part of me also thinks, though, that...
3084508	3095804	I've had this view of Nintendo as sort of the traditionalist in how social should be and the fact that they actually want to get people together in the same room
3097523	3099864	Doing in-person gaming.
3099944	3103144	I mean, it almost seems to me that they've got an agenda to encourage that.
3104465	3105985	And I don't know.
3106025	3108346	I don't see them changing off of that anytime really soon.
3109286	3113867	I got to go back to, like, real quick, you know, because that does make sense that that may be their agenda.
3113907	3118608	But then you got to go to the movie Joe Dirt, where there's the guy with, you know, the firework stand.
3118868	3121949	And all he has is sparklers and those little snakes.
3122990	3144271	and he's like but that's what I like but you can't just think about what you like or what your focus may be you have to think about other people out there I understand that may be the focus that you want people to game in the room but you know what would be awesome too is say you want to have that gaming experience but you can't get your friends over you know say that you know they're gone somewhere and you want to play with them anyways think about all the options
3144891	3148974	Koopa Kid Jeremy in our chatroom says, keep grandma off the internet.
3149294	3152396	Old people opening 90 tabs, all of them yahoo.com.
3153737	3155919	Oh, why did your friend Billy send me this link?
3155979	3157980	What is two girls, one cup?
3158080	3158720	What is this?
3158760	3160021	You know what's actually hilarious?
3160582	3164484	Dan's grandmother is super into the internet.
3164524	3165425	She does her genealogy.
3166425	3167065	Oh, that's my dad.
3167085	3167665	That's my dad.
3168026	3168246	Totally.
3168266	3178128	She's probably one of the most computer literate people in her age group that did not start off in programming or engineering that I know.
3178768	3180248	And it's pretty neat to watch her.
3180308	3186390	However, my maternal grandmother, she will like poke around a little bit and maybe look at Facebook and then that's it.
3186930	3189750	My granny's like, no, those things, I don't want to look at them.
3190971	3192411	Your daddy's going to mess with that, not me.
3193342	3194842	I love Kathy Griffin and Cher And Anderson Cooper
3220131	3221272	They all need to do a buddy comedy.
3221592	3226655	Alright, we have distanced ourselves way away from the original topic, which means next topic, DarkSakura.
3227516	3228577	Oh yeah, it's my turn, isn't it?
3229938	3231319	God damn it, Rob, making me work.
3232239	3234441	Well, there's a little game called Fire Emblem.
3235561	3239244	And this is actually for Fire Emblem.
3239884	3243727	Fire Emblem Awakening Summer Scramble is the new DLC.
3244187	3247810	It's out in North America and Europe, but they have censored a scene
3248770	3254874	There is a character named Tharja who, I guess she's like pulling at her underwear or something or pulling it up.
3255554	3267941	But the edit that they made to it makes it even worse because there's like a piece of cloth now, like a curtain or something that's flowed in between where her butt is.
3268441	3274365	And so all you see is like, if you weren't looking for the little strap on the side, it would look like she's got her hands in her ass.
3274385	3274805	Yeah.
3275718	3277359	She's digging her fingers in.
3277900	3279261	She's self-muppeting.
3281143	3282324	I like that.
3282464	3284225	I'm going to have to work on more conversations.
3284645	3285766	Is that on Urban Dictionary?
3287167	3287848	That should be, though.
3288869	3289690	But, like, it's just...
3292398	3298923	The only, okay, and this is my big thing about censorship, is that the only reason this shit's a big deal is because you make it a fucking big deal.
3299523	3306949	You know, it's like the approach I take to, quote, foul language around kids.
3307989	3312412	You know, if you're not supposed to say the words, that's just going to make it all the more attractive to say it, you know.
3312953	3315755	If you act like it's not a big deal, to them, it's not a big deal.
3316616	3321099	Same goes with, you know, censorship of, you know, a woman pulling up her underwear.
3322757	3324838	The way that they edited this... It's a bathing suit.
3325078	3325819	Whatever.
3327380	3327980	That's okay.
3328200	3336885	What they did to this, it just makes it look even worse because when you give somebody a clear concrete picture, it leaves a little room to the imagination.
3337245	3338066	Like black bars.
3338366	3338886	Exactly.
3339067	3340087	We did this in college.
3341108	3346691	We were making a music video and we had the guy stand out in just a pair of gym shorts.
3347091	3351094	But when we did the movie, we put a black bar over it because it was supposed to be the girls...
3352234	3353395	Why am I talking about this on the show?
3353436	3358901	We did like a Spice Girls music video for a college project and at the end of the video the girls Shut up!
3359282	3364387	The girls steal his clothes and so at the end he's just standing there with a black bar over it.
3364407	3369132	Well he didn't get naked for us he was wearing gym shorts and we put the black bar over it and it looked like he was naked!
3369572	3370653	It's an illusion!
3371113	3374296	And your pervy little minds don't think, oh, he's wearing gym shorts.
3374336	3377918	They think, oh, they had to block his penis.
3377958	3383182	Well, it's like you can also... Here's a good example of the Austin Powers movie, the first one.
3383803	3384823	Oh, God, yes.
3384883	3385604	With the cantaloupe.
3385624	3386525	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3386545	3391088	But she had, like, red pasties over the jumblies.
3392229	3393410	To steal Mystique's word.
3393970	3394070	Um...
3395211	3404540	But I mean, when you take away the concrete image and you put just something in front of it, it's going to leave a lot more to the imagination.
3404640	3415350	And in the end, I think it's going to, you know, probably be more unintentionally explicit.
3415610	3419433	Because the brain, if it can be porned, the brain will porn it.
3419453	3419874	Yeah.
3421241	3428547	and two, since I worked in a classy reference to Joe Dirt in the last topic, I'm going to reference Bioshock Infinite in this one.
3428847	3432730	The mind of the subject will desperately struggle to create memories where none exist.
3432750	3437093	In other words, they will undress the bitch when they can't see her clothes.
3438734	3439735	And also think of the children.
3439995	3440596	Think of the children.
3443496	3445217	How many children are playing Fire Emblem?
3445257	3447078	How many children can understand Fire Emblem?
3447098	3447859	It's a 3DS game.
3448119	3449940	All of the children are playing Fire Emblem.
3451081	3453523	I guess I say that and then I'm like, oh, wait a minute, Rob.
3453543	3457005	When you were 10, you were totally playing Final Fantasy.
3457986	3462108	Here's another fun example because Prince Brightstar mentioned the black bars in Japan.
3462849	3470014	Remember when we got Final Fuck X and it was all squared out, the pixelated?
3470034	3472075	I was like, we know that's badge.
3475818	3478520	Okay, we need to switch topics stat, Loki.
3478540	3480262	For the record, that was entirely hilarious.
3481703	3482964	It was just cosplay porn.
3482984	3486708	I mean, there wasn't even any male characters that were dressed up like Final Fantasy characters.
3486788	3487889	It was really good cosplay, though.
3489290	3489610	Fine.
3491412	3496316	Anyway, so there was a game that came out called Scribblenauts Unlimited.
3497680	3499342	And they keep adding stuff each year.
3499442	3501544	Well, this year they added some memes.
3502285	3509713	And to go along with that, Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat were some of the characters featured in the game.
3510554	3511155	And guess what?
3511275	3512216	They're copyrighted.
3512476	3519464	But apparently Fifth Cell or Warner Brothers didn't really give a shit or just were blatantly unaware that things get copyrighted on the internet and that kind of stuff.
3520064	3521546	So, yeah.
3521886	3527053	Apparently, the creators of those two properties are a little pissed off.
3527433	3528875	And they have filed a lawsuit.
3529856	3536123	Because, apparently, neither Fifth Cell or Warner Brothers were even acknowledging it.
3536344	3537485	Just kind of like, eh.
3539984	3562079	and you know they it's just some internet kids and you know they do um you know they obviously they do support the fact that people make things on the internet for non-profit stuff and that's fine but this is clearly for profit it was something that they advertised the game saying hey look Nandcat's in there and Keyboard Cat you should buy this game and people like oh cool I'm gonna buy the game because of that
3564362	3568304	Well, just like the Nintendo version had Mario and Luigi in it, and they had to work out that deal with Nintendo.
3568324	3570285	That's why they're not in the PC version, right?
3570705	3571305	It's very similar.
3572145	3573946	I kind of think a lot of this is ignorance.
3575227	3577748	I don't think the developers meant to do this maliciously.
3577768	3578788	No, I don't think that's even malicious.
3578948	3582529	I think they just thought, oh, Nyan Cat's like this 4chan thing.
3582569	3585110	Nobody really owns it, so let's just lift it.
3585430	3586650	It'll be funny for our game.
3587330	3598813	But now that WB, the parent company, is not returning these guys' phone calls, who, yeah, it is a trademark thing or whatever, now they're pissed off, and this is their warning shot to get noticed.
3599133	3601114	It'll get settled out of court, as these things always do.
3602074	3603295	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3625050	3628031	I don't... And Keyboard Cat's a little trickier.
3628551	3630732	I kind of think that's just thrown in for good measure.
3630952	3635933	I don't know if that has quite the legal... Well, they also have Long Cat and stuff, I think, are in the game.
3636193	3637514	But I don't think anybody owns Long Cat.
3637534	3639154	No, I don't think so.
3639754	3642295	Now I want to know if My Body is Ready is in there.
3644216	3650578	And then what that does... My Body is Ready is not a noun, though, so... Did I say a noun?
3650638	3651118	I think I did.
3651138	3651878	Neon.
3651898	3652138	Neon.
3656390	3664035	I know that there are a number of memes out there that are under copyright.
3664615	3669878	And I think that they're well within their right to pursue action.
3670438	3675741	And especially, I really, and this is maybe just a guilty pleasure.
3676342	3678463	I love seeing the big companies taken down a notch.
3679011	3679231	Yeah.
3680093	3682636	I mean, there's a lot of people quick to defend Scribblenauts and stuff.
3682676	3686122	And it's not that I'm anti-Scribblenauts or I want to see Scribblenauts.
3686242	3687343	No, I love Scribblenauts.
3687383	3688585	It's a cute game and so forth.
3688705	3692791	But I also like the internet culture and a lot of what the internet brings up.
3692871	3693332	It actually...
3694600	3698182	Some of these meme things, I really like to see how it turns around some people's lives.
3698202	3702243	Think about that chick, Ain't Nobody Got Time For That, when she was on the local news.
3703244	3705165	She's got commercial deals now.
3705245	3706725	Or Antoine.
3707085	3710147	That guy, there was a really interesting development with him this week.
3710367	3714248	But yeah, for all practical purposes, he did a lot with his stuff too.
3714308	3717090	They're clamming in your windows, they're snatching people up.
3717110	3722952	They milk their 15 minutes of fame, and it ends up being a happy ending of sorts.
3723052	3725154	Actually, I think that Queen Simeon and Chad is right.
3725434	3727715	Keyboard Cat is copyrighted or trademarked.
3727916	3728156	Yes.
3728196	3735901	Because, well, the guy, actually, I remember watching an interview where he licensed out his cat's likeness for the pistachio commercial.
3736021	3736222	Right.
3736962	3741766	But the cat in Scribblenauts doesn't really look like it, like Nyan Cat does.
3742406	3746269	It can be considered enough derivative, but I think copyright laws, what, 50% change?
3746329	3748871	Yeah, I think that would be the harder one to prove.
3748891	3751973	Well, and also the fact that you sum it by typing Keyboard Cat.
3753846	3754346	That's true.
3754366	3758009	But one could argue, well, it is a cat at the keyboard.
3758270	3758570	I don't know.
3759591	3761072	It is a cat that's neon.
3762573	3764175	I still want my body as ready to be in there.
3765253	3766014	That's not a noun.
3766634	3769036	Reggie Fils-Aimé could be in there in the Nintendo version.
3769496	3772458	I bet if you type that in, the only thing that happens is his jaw comes out.
3772818	3774279	The game just punches you in the face.
3774340	3775000	That's what happens.
3775200	3776121	Or starts printing money.
3776981	3779263	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, 4chan the game.
3779443	3780524	Ain't nobody got time for that.
3780924	3785247	I thought that's what Scribblenauts kind of like was its big selling point, was that it had all these memes in it.
3785548	3788129	Oh, those stupid guys that were sitting behind us at the baseball game?
3788570	3789791	They're like, foul ball!
3789911	3791091	Ain't nobody got time for that!
3791232	3791572	Yeah.
3792092	3792972	DarkSakura.com
3814617	3815719	Greenheart Games is the folks behind it.
3834130	3838851	And they did this interesting thing to kind of combat piracy, which I guess was some type of experiment or whatever.
3839391	3849974	And what they did is they put up a copy of the game on one of the big torrent sites and with a little info file that you'd see with most cracked games that says, you know, fully cracked, playable, da da da.
3850574	3860416	But in an old throwback to, let's say, the Earthbound pirate copies of many years ago, it would change the game significantly to make it unbeatable.
3860876	3862157	How does it change the game?
3862698	3867702	Well, at some point, piracy starts taking over your game development office.
3867962	3876269	You'll get a little message that pops up on the screen that says, It seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally.
3876689	3880372	If players don't buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.
3880452	3881893	You have to click on a little frown to continue.
3882173	3883815	You can't beat the game at this point.
3885016	3908218	and of course it has all these people posting on internet forums about it like how do I get the piracy to stop in the game which is just giving away how many people were pirating it very similar as well to didn't they do this with Arkham Asylum not City but Asylum they had like a whole thing where Batman couldn't make a certain jump and people were posting on forums about this and WB just went ban ban ban ban because these were all the people
3909119	3909919	Yeah, they were pirating it.
3910099	3920402	Anyway, this guy was collecting anonymous usage statistics and found that it was, what, over 90% of the copies of this being played were pirated.
3921402	3921962	Crazy.
3922622	3931524	But were those people going to actually play the game legitimately in the first place or did they just find it when they were browsing new games that are added to the Pirate Bay?
3931784	3937926	Because he put it out there himself on the Pirate Bay and people were downloading it.
3938466	3948534	and let's not forget that other indie companies have put out their game on the Pirate Bay to drive up interest in the game and to, you know, get people to test the game out.
3949295	3960143	So, that's my thing is, I wonder, I'm not saying someone could fuse that for this, I'm sure that people are just pirating, but you can't attribute, if you didn't do that...
3961164	3961825	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3976824	3978505	And now all these people are writing stories about it.
3978886	3980387	And now he has a legit version out there.
3980447	3982408	And now everyone's like, oh, we've got to support the Indies.
3982428	3985590	Let's go buy this game, even though you may or may not want to play it.
3985670	3993336	Well, either way you slice this pie, Loki, whether you want to say it was the piracy mechanism or the exposure, genius move.
3995498	4001442	No matter which way you slice it, whatever angle they were... Either it was a genius anti-piracy scheme or it was a genius marketing scheme.
4001502	4008547	But it's not very honest in the fact that, you know, basically they're... It's kind of like, I wouldn't say like entrapment almost.
4008707	4013051	The irony of you saying entrapping pirates is not very honest.
4013311	4014111	The irony.
4014351	4015032	It hurts.
4015312	4016133	It's burning.
4017073	4018855	I need ice cubes.
4019055	4023278	I feel less sorry about a company that puts their game up there by themselves...
4023938	4026299	versus a game getting leaked to the internet.
4026639	4027719	What were you going to say, Jamie?
4027759	4028819	Sorry, I had to make my point.
4029200	4032421	Breakman was saying using Pirate Bay as your game testers.
4034981	4037902	It does end up being kind of like a demo of sorts.
4037922	4042463	I mean, cool.
4042663	4044724	You know, cool that people are checking out the game.
4046328	4049070	I'm sure that's what they wanted in the end, and hopefully it works out for them.
4050812	4052273	I personally am not going to pick up this game.
4052573	4060359	It may have been, you know, the fact that it's compared to Game Dev Story, it's a little similar to that, might be intriguing, but after what they did, fuck them.
4060840	4061440	I'm not buying it.
4061821	4062641	I'm not playing it either.
4062661	4065203	So you are personally offended by this little move?
4065223	4066384	I just think it's shady.
4066484	4067385	It's so shady.
4067665	4068566	There's, like...
4069967	4073710	There's a difference between... But the Pirate Bay is shady.
4073930	4082777	There's a difference between putting something in your game, you know, like the Michael Jackson game on DS.
4082877	4083738	Oh, the Vuvuzela thing.
4083758	4084899	Somebody just brought that up in chat.
4085119	4086440	Or like Batman stuff.
4086480	4089862	Programming a little thing in there to catch pirates when the game gets leaked out.
4090643	4091664	Okay, that's something.
4091804	4094286	That's kind of cool that they've got that in there and you can catch people doing it.
4094626	4098469	But the fact that you go, Oh, we're going to show these pirates.
4098489	4099410	We're going to upload our own...
4099670	4100811	I mean, come on, that's stupid.
4100831	4106234	That's like saying, oh, I'm going to open up my house and I'm going to say, hey, come steal my shit.
4106394	4108615	And then get pissed off that people are stealing my shit.
4109636	4111077	I'm sorry, that's just stupid.
4111657	4112177	It's stupid.
4112257	4114559	And you think you're going to teach these people moral?
4114799	4121583	It's one of those things like, to say that this is going to work in getting people to buy your game is just like those stupid advertisements before.
4121923	4123864	Think about the lighting rig people.
4123924	4126966	They're out of jobs because you pirate your movies.
4128567	4130248	I'm sorry, it's just stupid.
4130588	4141134	Okay, let's say we're about ready to put out a CD of exclusive Orange Lounge Radio material and things that, you know, never before heard on the show and that's how we're going to pay for our hosting for the next year.
4141194	4142214	Hypothetical situation.
4142594	4150719	How do I make sure that that CD does not get pirated without possibly offending the pirates out there in the world?
4150939	4151399	You can't.
4153600	4154121	It's music.
4154141	4154941	You're not going to be able to.
4154961	4156362	There's no DRM that you can put on that.
4156716	4158760	So, bend over and take it.
4159021	4159582	And enjoy it.
4161025	4165173	Put it out there for free yourself and just hope they'll rally behind you because you're one of them.
4166718	4167879	Most likely, here's the thing.
4167939	4172462	The situation with that is you're not going to have a whole lot of interest in people putting it up.
4172542	4182347	They're not going to leak it out there because they just don't... They figure that if there's no interest in trying to get the game, they're not going to necessarily put it out there or the content.
4182728	4188771	So, for example, I can't find copies of maybe somebody VHS recording...
4190012	4191353	episodes of Being Bobby Brown.
4191674	4193375	That's just not on the internet at all.
4193575	4200062	My wife is wanting me to search high and low and I will until the day I die to find copies of that.
4200482	4201383	But it's just not up there.
4201403	4205767	For Being Bobby Brown, I will endorse piracy because everybody has to see that.
4205947	4206447	Bobby!
4207428	4213612	It's fantastic, but Whitney was a bitch and she fucking had her lawyers take all that shit down.
4213632	4215533	And that means babe in total control of herself.
4215553	4215953	Exactly.
4216573	4221056	And she had everybody take the copies off the internet.
4221076	4223978	A lot of the clips, too, are just gone.
4224478	4226879	So, unfortunately, there's that.
4226979	4229901	But I just don't think anyone would pirate our CD.
4230081	4233983	I mean, sure, they could leak it out there, but is anyone really going to care to download it?
4234243	4234443	Okay.
4236005	4245293	Maybe my example about music was a bad one, but when it comes to games, you had Tim here on the show last night whose job is in the industry making games like Tomb Raider.
4245993	4254541	What is an effective DRM strategy that we can do to make sure that as many games as possible sell legitimately so people like Tim can continue to be employed?
4254901	4255301	Free-to-play.
4255681	4258743	Because you basically... Everything's gotta go free-to-play.
4258963	4260724	Everything's gotta go free-to-play.
4261004	4268267	And I'm not saying free-to-play to the point of, you know... It doesn't have to necessarily be free-to-play, like cheap-to-play, I guess.
4268347	4271469	You know, like $10 games with a ton of DLC.
4271629	4277451	DLC that makes sense, not just, oh, you're out of energy points, you gotta buy some DLC to be able to play this game longer.
4277831	4280993	Not anything retarded like that, but actually supported DLC.
4281653	4287016	I mean, granted, the game might be shorter because it's more of a demo, but that's what I'm saying.
4287076	4288916	It's basically you get a small amount of content.
4288997	4296600	For example, Ridge Racer for the Vita would have worked perfectly like that, except they charged $40 for it, or $30 for four tracks.
4296680	4297240	It's ridiculous.
4297340	4302103	If they put it out for like $5 or $10, probably like $5 would be perfect.
4302203	4303483	Bobby's retort in chat.
4303563	4304084	It's a fair one.
4304104	4304904	I got to put it out there.
4305064	4306905	This was an $8 game, and it was still pirated.
4308226	4308847	It's still a game.
4310988	4311509	I understand that.
4311649	4315372	It may be an $8 game, but once again, they put it out there first.
4315392	4318254	They put it out there.
4318334	4321036	Would an $8 game be leaked that quickly?
4321636	4322337	That's the question.
4323238	4326140	How quickly would an $8 indie game be leaked out to the internet?
4326500	4329382	There's people who leak games just because they can.
4329542	4330883	I understand that they can.
4330903	4336346	But if there's DRM on it, I'm assuming it's DRM free, but let's assume that there was DRM on it.
4336446	4341308	Would really someone spend the time to crack this game and put it out there?
4341428	4343870	I mean, sure, there's probably somebody out there that would do it.
4344270	4349193	But I don't know if it's going to have as big of a draw once now it's all controversial.
4349913	4350473	I love Steam so much.
4350493	4350693	Like...
4379175	4380515	I think that's the thing.
4380836	4387497	You've got to find that balance between how much do I charge for it and make sure enough people buy it so that I recoup my cost.
4387537	4391558	It seems also double-edged sword, too, because now there's games that come out on PC.
4391658	4396339	I might think of buying Bioshock Infinite on PC as well as on 360.
4396379	4401041	Because I already have the 360 version, but I may buy it on PC.
4401161	4402601	But am I going to pay full price for it?
4402861	4414410	Fuck no, I'm gonna wait for a sale because they have sales all the damn time on Steam, on Amazon, on Green Man Gaming, on Gamefly with Steam DRM, on, you know, wherever.
4414850	4418433	You're gonna find these games for, you know, marked down to, like, nothing.
4419153	4423196	And that's the kind of mentality, I mean, look at Tomb Raider, it was just half price.
4423376	4425558	That came out, like, two months ago?
4425878	4426378	A month ago?
4426398	4426478	Yeah.
4428000	4430404	I mean, shit, you can't do this with console games.
4430944	4432186	They're not dropping that fast.
4432386	4436031	They're not going to be five bucks one day and then next day... Well, some do.
4436833	4441139	Well, some do, but I'm talking about Tomb Raider, a game that sold quite a bit.
4441379	4443522	It was totally not a disappointment to anybody, but I'm...
4445204	4447985	GameGuru in chat says, well, I believe DRM is rather stupid.
4448306	4451008	What the game dev tycoon guys did was actually pretty clever.
4452509	4456391	Breakman says, dev equal, I'll give you $20 to go buy this $10 game.
4456471	4457592	Loki equal, fuck that.
4457912	4458953	Then I'll have to go out of my way.
4458973	4459814	I'm just going to pirate it.
4462615	4463956	I don't pirate games anymore.
4465718	4467639	I mean, I don't pirate games to, you know,
4469096	4471077	Maybe to play them early and then buy the game.
4471097	4472278	But you don't pirate them any less?
4472818	4474038	Yes, I don't pirate them any less.
4474419	4478521	No, I don't pirate PC games anymore, for sure.
4479881	4481362	Maybe to play them a little early, yes.
4481942	4482883	But I do buy them always.
4484534	4485034	Thanks for watching!
4499565	4508630	But if a game gets leaked out that's supposed to be out in a couple months, and I can play it way early, I'm all about playing games as soon as I can.
4509150	4515013	If Grand Theft Auto 5 gets leaked out tomorrow, you better believe I'm going to find a way to get it.
4515554	4517975	But you better believe I'm going to be buying it when it comes out.
4518095	4518776	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4538334	4539476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4555373	4579126	that was a hack on Uplay but there are some other stuff that gets leaked out I think from duplicators or game you know they go to retail early because they street date stuff and they ship to the retailer like a week early and so then that gets leaked out by some employee but then there's like the Microsoft games that come out a month ahead time and I'm assuming that's duplicators because I can't see how the hell it could leak any earlier than that
4579466	4581486	Alright, I'm sure we'll get some emails on this at a later date.
4581967	4595109	Excuse me, mailbag at orangeonsradio.com I do actually want to say there's been a couple cases where I've downloaded PC games through a torrent site because the servers were down for the actual site and I had a key to play it.
4595729	4596149	Just saying.
4596609	4600010	Sometimes, especially if you play Ragnarok online, sometimes it's the only way to get it.
4601730	4602931	Alright, let's move on with more news.
4602951	4604291	We're running long, so DarkSakura.
4605737	4606998	All right, let me get it.
4607699	4616967	Now, there is, for people who are fans of Eternal Darkness, there is a spiritual successor called Shadow of the Eternals that's been announced.
4618448	4632880	In fact, there's already a bunch of information out on it saying that it's going to be out on PC and Wii U and that they are trying to score 1.5 million to fund the game.
4636932	4638273	I'm sure it's going to be interesting.
4639814	4645237	What I'm not seeing is if it's a Kickstarter or not out yet for that.
4645317	4651281	But they are wanting to do it episodic and have it out by Q3 2014.
4651381	4651541	Cool.
4651942	4652142	Cool.
4658180	4661322	Some people I know on Twitter are not big fans of this idea.
4661542	4667805	As much as Eternal Darkness was awesome, apparently the guy who made it, Dennis Dyack, hasn't made a lot of winners.
4668306	4670207	So they're not sure if this is something worth supporting.
4670307	4671327	But he'll get the money.
4671447	4678872	Well, it looks like it's going to be produced through Precursor Games.
4679812	4681353	So, Canadian group.
4681933	4683154	Good games are coming out of Canada.
4684679	4690743	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming a little bit sooner than things that are getting kick-started right now.
4691244	4692384	Loki, start us off with the U.S.
4692585	4693645	There's nothing coming up this week.
4695507	4696407	Seriously, nothing.
4697408	4697688	Really?
4698208	4698429	Nothing.
4698809	4699609	Not a damn thing?
4699830	4706154	Nothing until the 14th, and 14th will be Metro 20, or not 23, Metro Last Light on the 14th.
4706274	4706714	Why is that?
4706774	4708596	Is that just because it's a slow time of year?
4708836	4710657	They figure everybody's seeing Iron Man?
4710797	4712839	It's a slow time of the year, usually.
4713099	4721925	Usually there's still quite a few releases coming out, but I think we're getting that pre-console launch lull, and so we don't have a lot of games coming out.
4721945	4729390	There was supposed to be the Wii U version of Deus Ex Human Revolution, but that is now TBA, so...
4731031	4731451	DarkSakura,
4748397	4749538	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4770927	4776469	Golden Week is actually, from what I understand, kind of hard to sell anything because nobody's there.
4777770	4779470	Golden Week is when you go home to visit your family.
4780791	4782951	This week would be, I think, a lot busier for sales.
4784132	4785272	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
4785512	4788693	Well, we have a very few things in the UK.
4788774	4798477	On the 9th, we have Sid Meier's Ace Patrol, and the 10th, Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut for Wii U, and Persona 4, the ultimate in Mayonaka Arena.
4799844	4802285	for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4802625	4805306	So I'm sure our buddy Magi is very happy about that.
4805826	4807427	As he told me earlier that he was happy.
4807607	4810608	Because he said after he wrote us that letter that he found out it was coming out.
4812169	4812349	Nice.
4812729	4814270	And the new Shin Megami Tensei.
4815523	4816643	Thank you for watching!
4838869	4839069	Madden 25
4856974	4858054	Out this year, right?
4858615	4858915	25 years.
4859415	4860375	25 sequels to Madden.
4860655	4860835	Yes.
4861676	4870439	And they've actually... I mean, there was... On one of the boxes, they even said... Credits him for the Madden games.
4870859	4873620	And now it's just nothing.
4873840	4875761	No sort of royalties or anything.
4875801	4877642	Even though he was a co-creator of the series.
4877722	4877862	So...
4879890	4880170	I don't know.
4880330	4881611	It sounds like he has a pretty strong case.
4881671	4884053	It'll be interesting to see if it gets settled out of court or not.
4884393	4885194	Of course it will.
4885314	4888396	It says it's going to trial, so you never know.
4889197	4890117	Just because it goes to trial.
4890177	4891038	First day of the trial.
4891198	4892099	Oh, he reached an agreement.
4892139	4892559	Go figure.
4894417	4896118	That happened to me once when I was on jury duty.
4896178	4899299	We were sitting in the little hallway waiting to go in the room.
4899399	4900539	I didn't even know what the case was about.
4900559	4901820	I didn't know if it was criminal, civil, what.
4902120	4906541	We're sitting in the hallway waiting to go in the room, and then we're sitting there for like an hour, an hour and a half.
4906681	4910863	They come out and say, oh, they just settled, so we're going to have you guys all go back to the jury room.
4911743	4912823	Yeah, I've had that happen before too.
4912863	4914464	Like, okay.
4915944	4916865	It's a game of chicken.
4917905	4918865	How far are we going to go?
4918885	4920126	Are we actually going to get the jury in here?
4920346	4921546	Man, jury duty is great.
4921646	4923127	It's like your chance to sit and read a book.
4924128	4925069	Jury duty is not so bad.
4925569	4929712	Maybe it's just this particular county because here in Sacramento it's just one day or one child.
4929732	4932254	They actually have really decent snacks in the cafeteria.
4932815	4934096	And that's super important.
4934436	4939560	I made a friend that was in our WoW guild because we were both on jury duty.
4940320	4949413	And we're sitting in the hallway freaking talking about our Draenei and how we were looking forward to seeing what the new expansion was and we're all so disappointed.
4950014	4950354	But yeah.
4950554	4955101	The last time I was on jury duty, I was playing...
4957020	4963707	I want to say it was Final Fantasy 4, the after years, but wasn't that only on Wii at the time?
4963927	4965629	So it must have just been Final Fantasy 4.
4965689	4967550	Maybe that's when the DS cartridge came out.
4967671	4968471	I bet that's what it was.
4968491	4971114	And I was playing the crap out of that at jury duty.
4972030	4974312	I just remember being so bored sitting at home.
4975073	4989365	No, it wasn't because I was actually working at that other place but I went in for my jury duty and it gave me a chance to read my book and get my stuff done and I sadly didn't get picked for a jury because I kind of wanted to be on one so I could have the people's court theme going in my head.
4989585	4991446	I sat on one in 2006.
4991846	4995027	I'm on a nice long murder trial.
4995107	4996167	No, you don't.
4996227	4997068	Be careful what you wish for.
4997088	4999969	I was on a two-week trial for a criminal case.
5000049	5003790	It wasn't murder, but it was very bad stuff.
5003850	5005851	I'm glad I got to do my civic duty.
5006191	5008892	I'm glad I got to see Law & Order play out in front of me.
5008972	5013174	The very animated prosecutor was awesome to watch.
5013214	5017035	She was great, but I never want to be on a trial like that again in my life.
5018356	5023300	But I actually don't mind the waiting for it just because it gives me a chance to read.
5024581	5025982	Alright, anyhow, how do we get on jury duty?
5026522	5029605	Well, it must be... Video games and jury duty!
5029645	5033108	Well, it's legal week here on OLR because guess what my story is about?
5033368	5034629	Another lawsuit!
5035109	5040413	And this is one of those, oh, we must have seen this coming after all the internet rage about Mass Effect 3.
5040473	5041874	I remember when somebody tried to sue there.
5042275	5044116	Well, guess what game got targeted this time?
5044416	5044997	Alien Skyrim!
5045157	5074937	Colonial Marines, that's right Sega and Gearbox class action lawsuit against them saying you knowingly misrepresented Aliens Colonial Marines at trade show demos fascinating and a lot of people were bitching about this too like the game that came out did not match what they were showing at E3 and all this so but I don't know like can you sue a movie because the movie wasn't as good as the trailer and they put stuff in the trailer all the time that doesn't end up in the real movie
5077074	5077594	I don't know though.
5077614	5084719	Well, you know, I would like, you know, the two hours of my life back for Mortal Kombat Resurrection or whatever the crap it was.
5085219	5087540	And I totally blame Jessica and Ross for making me watch that.
5087600	5089281	Actually, I blame Ross for making me watch that movie.
5089962	5096365	But I didn't go demand, you know, that people give me money or anything for a shitty movie.
5097766	5102149	I mean, I pretty much know shit anyway, but the trailers made it look a lot more interesting than it actually was.
5102169	5103650	And it was the sequel to the first one.
5103670	5105571	It was actually really boring and stupid.
5106141	5110143	All right, anyhow, TimeGate Studios, maybe they can see this coming.
5110203	5115806	The end is coming because, of course, they are the developer behind Aliens, Colonial Marines, co-developer.
5116226	5117967	And they also developed a game called Section 8.
5118567	5126771	They filed for bankruptcy protection at the Texas Southern Bankruptcy Court, apparently owing their creditors between $10 and $50 million in debt.
5126991	5128352	That's a hell of a price range.
5128372	5130033	That's a very odd estimate.
5130373	5150326	but yeah, TimeGate seeking protection against creditors now granted they aren't the target of this lawsuit per se but yeah don't release a game as bad as Aliens Colonial Marines people because in this day and age you'll get sued over it how dare you waste my time
5153143	5154704	Then again, $60 for a game.
5155024	5155944	It's a big chunk of change.
5156064	5162446	And also they had, you know, all the media that was from it was from the, you know, pre-release thing.
5162526	5164967	So there was nothing like ads development goes.
5165507	5169709	Oh, hey, yeah, we had to scale back this stuff because it wouldn't run on a console.
5170529	5174050	All right, well, let's travel to a time when things were a lot simpler.
5176131	5176991	To the intro of our show.
5177011	5178852	We got a new theme back in the day.
5178932	5181773	When we first started the show this evening, before we started...
5183485	5184809	Long, long time ago.
5184989	5185992	A couple hours.
5186533	5191265	Back then, we weren't talking about Final Fuck X. We were just talking about, you know, blowjobs.
5191285	5191706	I don't know.
5197073	5198814	It's the classic game of the week.
5199154	5205717	You know, back in the day, you would buy a game like, I don't know, what was it?
5205737	5206117	E.T.
5206197	5207378	What was a really terrible game?
5207398	5208318	Okay, E.T.
5208338	5208898	And you know what?
5209298	5210519	You just got stuck with it.
5210579	5212620	There was no class action lawsuit because E.T.
5212640	5212940	sucked.
5213500	5219042	Alright, DarkSakura, go into the gaming vault and find a game that, hey, the kids should be playing this week.
5219102	5220503	What is the classic game of the week?
5220663	5226167	The Classic Game of the Week is Magical Chase for the PC Engine, also known as the TurboGrafx.
5227087	5232171	And I will tell you right now that this is one of the holy grails of the U.S.
5232811	5239396	TurboDuo, sorry, TurboGrafx games, because they did like five copies in the U.S.,
5241637	5245698	I actually, I don't even, I would like a copy of this because it's actually a really neat little game.
5246779	5252861	Magical Chase was put out by Palsoft and released by Quest on the PC Engine.
5253221	5255682	Came out in 1991 in Japan and 93 in the US.
5256142	5259763	And you play as a little witch named Ripple who flies on a broomstick.
5260763	5263204	I swear I used to get this confused with Cotton back in the day for the record.
5264824	5265705	But you have...
5266545	5267226	Star Maidens Ingradius
5284049	5287272	And that's funny, the article even compares it to Cotton.
5287633	5289735	Success did Cotton, not Compiles.
5292057	5302447	But it was one of the last games that was released in the US for the TurboGrafx, TurboDuo, and had a ton of hype, and now it's like you'd be hard-pressed to find a copy.
5303669	5309838	Um, so, as you play through the game, you, uh, have, uh, normal and hard difficulty settings.
5310699	5314064	Um, you can only play, uh, the first three levels on easy.
5314985	5315406	And, uh...
5318371	5322954	If once your enemies are destroyed, they leave gemstones behind, so that's your currency in games.
5322974	5328478	You can buy power-ups, health, extra lives, except on the third and sixth levels, it only appears once.
5329758	5333521	Touching stuff on the ground does not kill you, but it does slow you down.
5334481	5337703	And if you get trapped behind objects, you get scrolling damage.
5339174	5341475	You have your different levels.
5341535	5353260	You have Cuboligon, Dodongren, Kamikaze Dangun, Fat Metal, which just sounds funny, Gemini Snow, and then the Sixth Seal.
5354100	5356021	So there are other ports.
5356081	5356942	They did a...
5358783	5362565	version for Windows 95, 98 that came out in 1998.
5363205	5369068	And then they did Magical Chase GB for the Game Boy Color only in Japan on August 4th, 2000.
5369689	5372670	And like I said, it's rare.
5372730	5378694	In fact, I was about to eBay it just to see exactly if there's any copies on eBay right now.
5379754	5380455	So let's find out.
5381995	5383796	And it's honestly a cute little game.
5383836	5386318	I like that level because it looks like she's flying over Tetris blocks.
5386966	5388828	Why are you trying to autocorrect me to chase?
5412714	5414917	Why don't you keep reading and I'll look it up real quick.
5414977	5416039	Well, I got it right now.
5416981	5417561	I don't want the dinner.
5420645	5432354	Magical Chase, PC Engine, the Japanese version, $229.80 Super Rare, NEC, PC Engine, HuCard This is still the Japanese version, $249.00 $199.00 Even the Game Boy Color version is going for $249.00 We have a Japanese soundtrack for $50.00
5446044	5446625	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5468723	5475451	You've got a celebrity, a small internet celebrity, who would make puppy eyes at you until you give it to her.
5476552	5477613	Or Panorama Cotton.
5477713	5478815	Those are like on my list.
5479956	5489146	Although, to be honest, if I saw this and then I saw Radiant Silvergun right next to it to get for Dan, I think that I would do the right thing and get this for myself.
5490666	5491227	Good answer.
5491887	5492388	Very good answer.
5492408	5493569	Actually, I don't think Dan would follow me.
5493989	5494290	Alright.
5495371	5498534	There it is, your classic game of the week, Magical Chase, No Relation to Cotton.
5499690	5501631	But a small resemblance to Fantasy Zone.
5501771	5503252	But she doesn't go, Willow!
5503572	5504813	Alright.
5504893	5505393	Good pick.
5505734	5508735	I knew nothing about this game, and now I'm looking at it going, gosh, I want to play this.
5508856	5510396	Too bad I'll have to emulate it.
5510597	5514519	You can get... It is out there, too.
5514879	5515900	Of course it is.
5515920	5517561	Of course it is.
5517601	5520503	And I would not blame a single soul for downloading the game.
5520543	5520983	Just saying.
5522004	5535778	in my allegedly you know a game that's this hard to find that's this old I mean who could really fault you for it if it was on virtual console or something we'd say go you better believe I have an emulated copy of Panorama Cotton since they made 600 total in the world so
5536673	5539015	All right, there it is, your classic Game of the Week segment.
5539336	5540076	We're going to take a break.
5540437	5542819	When we come back, plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come.
5543339	5545201	Xbox rumors, yippee-yay.
5545261	5547303	We only have a few more weeks to sit through those.
5548244	5553589	Also talking about some free-to-play stuff on Wii U. Call of Duty, yes, and plenty more.
5553669	5556291	Your calls in the Fugle Question of the Week, all about pinball tonight.
5556431	5556752	Duty.
5557552	5561276	When we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
5567982	5578470	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Cinco de Mayo, May 5th, 2013, with episode 503 of our show already in progress.
5578550	5587697	And if you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, you missed some pretty lively debates in the first half of the show, so we hope you will check that out in the podcast feed.
5588358	5592701	I also have to give apologies here at the start of this segment to our friends over at Anime Jam Session.
5593421	5596562	They put on a lovely show, which is on Tuesday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network.
5596702	5598563	And it's 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.
5598643	5600103	And they rebroadcast Thursday mornings.
5602744	5608685	They sent us a bumper for the 500th episode that I still haven't played because I was trying to sync it to music a couple weeks ago.
5608705	5610706	And I literally ran out of time because it wasn't working.
5611066	5612326	And I just forgot to do it today.
5612946	5618108	And I've also been procrastinating it because nobody else except Flaco sent us a bumper.
5618508	5618688	So...
5619088	5624131	Please take a look at the post in our forums and send us more bumpers and then I'll have reasons to play them all.
5624592	5633978	But I also want to give a shout out to our pals over there at Anime Jam Session because I got a lovely package in the mail from a mail package from Ranma this week.
5634898	5635919	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5661138	5680369	in coming weeks of the show and maybe if there's like a live event coming up like Fanime or something I'll take some of these with me to that and you can win them from me there too so yeah thank you very much to our pals over there I think Brad's first in line now well what did Brad say oh I sent you guys booze what else do you want
5681249	5683391	Yeah, Brad, you make a good case.
5683932	5686534	I guess I should be sending him some Cards Against Humanity cards for sure.
5688316	5690818	We trade goods amongst the Voice of Geeks Network shows.
5690838	5691719	The bartering system.
5691739	5692720	Yeah, bartering system.
5692760	5694722	You give me booze, I give you cards.
5695603	5700688	I didn't give Anime Jam Session anything yet, but I will... Ranma has my heart.
5701369	5702129	They have my heart.
5702209	5702790	That's what they have.
5703310	5703631	All right.
5706133	5713256	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase FLAG.
5713937	5716998	Anyhow, let us get back into some gaming news.
5717138	5719499	Rapid fire news for this part B. Loki.
5720260	5724622	Borderlands has, well, originally it kind of leaked out from a picture, but...
5725602	5737371	it has now been officially announced Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is going to be the next piece of DLC or I should say the last piece or fourth piece did they make her politically correct yet?
5737652	5750882	no so it's sort of a play on Dungeons and Dragons it'll be interesting so that's supposed to be coming out June 25th and it will be included in the season pass otherwise it's 10 bucks
5754182	5757565	There's a new game console trailer this week.
5757885	5763229	It's not even really a game console as much as it's more of like an analog video game synthesizer.
5763609	5765310	It's a thing called Ming Mecca.
5766231	5768192	And it's really strange.
5768232	5770334	I mean, it works just like a synthesizer.
5770394	5777559	So it has a lot of analog, you know, physical cords that you're plugging in the stuff and, you know, dials you're tweaking and that sort of thing.
5778159	5778860	And it kind of...
5779640	5783943	It makes music like a synthesizer and also kind of does an interactive display.
5784403	5787025	Like you could do games and stuff sort of on it.
5787345	5789206	Very basic glitchy looking things.
5791068	5795150	I see this more as like something that you would see with like chiptune artists or something like that.
5795231	5798973	Kind of messing around with you know in like a live performance type setting.
5799393	5802715	Because it seems like that would you know play well to it.
5802796	5804497	Plus it is open source.
5805717	5809260	So you can actually you know build one yourself if you want.
5810000	5835777	or they're going to be selling it they said they estimate the console is going to be anywhere from you know um you know was it $350 for the control core or $1,000 for the world core because it's a few I mean we're talking like it is a synthesizer so that's kind of in the realm of that makes sense price wise as a video game console not so much but it does get controlled partially within the NES controller so it looks interesting um
5836837	5861777	and last but not least the kickstarted project or it was attempted to be kickstarted but it kind of failed Project Awakened has now put itself on hold I guess due to alternate funding options and donors are now receiving refunds in other words somebody is picking this thing up and will probably publish it so that's kind of cool
5863058	5864239	because it looked kind of interesting.
5864319	5866201	One of the first Unreal 4 games.
5866622	5872607	It's kind of like a third-person superhero action game.
5873468	5874109	So it could be neat.
5874966	5877067	DRAGON QUEST 8 White Knight Chronicles Rare Drop Adventure Note
5894895	5897496	Earth Devastating B-Rank Girlfriend.
5898356	5899957	That's what it's called.
5900317	5901278	That's an awesome title.
5901738	5902898	And Wonderflick.
5903418	5904959	That's kind of a neat little sounding thing, too.
5905499	5908080	They were all trademarked by the developer all around the same time.
5908400	5909201	Who knows what this could be?
5909241	5911262	These could be three titles in one series.
5911322	5913062	These could all be new games in development.
5913803	5914903	They could be red herrings.
5915223	5915543	Who knows?
5915563	5916264	They could be anything.
5917024	5920565	But I hope they all sound like neat titles.
5920625	5922166	So whatever they are, they're pretty kick-ass titles.
5922967	5944805	but of course you know you can't judge a game based off its title but these are good starts but we don't know anything else about these maybe E3 maybe Tokyo Game Show it sounds like it might be like the third guild game they always have like these weird like kind of indie games that are a prize of that so maybe these are titles in that okay that's a good theory
5945686	5945946	All right.
5946366	5952712	Also, Nintendo apparently going to be introducing Retro Studios' new project in the not-so-distant future.
5953193	5955735	Could this be E3 or a Nintendo Direct?
5956175	5956836	Who knows?
5957477	5961300	But Hiroyamada said, quote, I wonder what kind of game it is.
5961540	5964763	I hope to introduce it to you in the not-so-distant future.
5964984	5965304	Hmm.
5966585	5968968	I'll tell you what it should be It should be a new Excite Shark game
5981923	5982964	It should be a new Excite Truck game.
5982984	5985166	Is that what you want Retro Studios to be working on?
5985206	5986327	That would sell me a system.
5986527	5988228	A new Excite Truck game that's good.
5988508	5993492	I'm not talking fucking Excite Bots trick racing because that was absolute shit.
5994133	5997796	I will be tickled pink if it's a new Metroid or a new F-Zero.
5998296	5999417	Especially a new F-Zero.
5999937	6000678	That would be pretty cool.
6001478	6002699	At least that's a racing game, Loki.
6002719	6004060	You gotta get excited about that a little bit.
6004981	6007343	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6027410	6029531	Is it online only?
6029771	6031752	Well, the rumor is, yes it is.
6032092	6036234	But what, I mean, of course that rumor is going to be out there after what happened with SimCity.
6036274	6039856	It will be very interesting to see how what happened with SimCity plays into this.
6040236	6045439	Regardless, we all know it's got to happen eventually, but it looks like it's something that could be happening relatively soon.
6045819	6048740	They are saying this could actually be announced tomorrow, May 6th.
6048941	6052002	So by the time any of you hear this podcast, it could have been announced today.
6052443	6059472	This is due to a web domain registration apparently by EA which I would have thought you would grab the Sims 4 name a hell of a long time ago.
6059612	6059953	Whatever.
6060533	6062957	The studio is holding a conference call tomorrow.
6063237	6064799	Supposed to be making a major announcement.
6064839	6066001	So what the hell else would it be?
6066181	6068544	Except maybe five more Sims 3 expansions.
6068704	6068985	Yes.
6070046	6071086	They have about that many.
6071786	6073087	You want to know what's really sad?
6073807	6082769	Is that with Sims 3, the stuff that the mod community's been doing is worlds better than any of the official stuff that EA put out.
6083430	6086490	I mean, even down to custom furniture, everything.
6086630	6088811	The fan community has just been perfect.
6088851	6094753	And I would love for... It would actually... I would buy it if they would hire some of the mod people.
6094773	6095413	The people who've done mods.
6095433	6096253	Well, they're not Valve.
6096673	6103063	I know, but I'm saying that would sell it for me right there is certain people in the custom community.
6103083	6104565	You don't want to be always connected?
6105066	6106047	No!
6106448	6107649	I hate people.
6107830	6109833	Because Sims Online...
6112256	6113917	Sims Online worked so well.
6114418	6118241	And also the Sims Social worked so well that they're totally closing that game.
6118261	6120863	Actually, Sims Social, everybody was fucking playing that.
6121243	6122284	I played Sims Social.
6122304	6123885	That came and went.
6124025	6127528	I kind of wish Candy Crush Saga would... I finally blocked it this week, y'all.
6127588	6128569	I couldn't anymore.
6128669	6135875	And then what happens last night, I'm lying in bed and I hear this very familiar song and I'm like, what are you doing over there on your phone, Alan?
6136417	6139158	I'm stuck on level 29 in Candy Crush Saga.
6139758	6140959	No!
6141419	6142339	You can't escape.
6142999	6145680	For the record, I don't hate people, just most people.
6147841	6149222	You love all our listeners, right?
6149782	6150042	Yeah.
6150062	6151143	Okay, good.
6152343	6153423	Yeah, I love you guys.
6155684	6156585	No, seriously, I love you guys.
6156605	6156965	Seriously.
6157185	6157525	Seriously.
6157885	6158385	Love you mean it.
6158445	6158865	Seriously.
6159426	6160986	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
6161546	6162667	I am not Grumpy Cat.
6163967	6165068	I'm not Grumpy Cat.
6165388	6165508	I'm...
6167310	6195334	Disgruntled Cat Anyway, Square Enix is remastering soundtracks from Final Fantasy games We will be seeing the Final Fantasy 4 one released on looks like July 3rd this year That's the first one they're starting with and they're going to have box art done especially by Yoshitaka Amano and then of course we're probably not going to see it in the US but
6196195	6199665	Square Enix does do digital releases for a lot of their albums so we might see it on iTunes
6201611	6206292	Of course, you know, if you actually want a physical CD so that you can get the awesome artwork, there's always CD Japan.
6207533	6212914	Also, Breakman, I am not hating your faces, okay?
6213034	6214174	I don't hate anyone's faces.
6215735	6229298	Also, we have a notice that there is a DVD out called 100 Yen, the Japanese Arcade Experience, which is a documentary about arcade culture in Japan.
6230419	6233001	There's a trailer for it out if you're interested in looking at it.
6233161	6240869	But not only does it talk about just gaming, arcade gaming in Japan, it does talk about the US and Canada as well.
6241470	6242491	And the casual gamers.
6246065	6261662	and last but not least for people who are pinball fans like me Pinball FX 2 is coming to Steam the game itself will be free but the tables will be 10 bucks a pop 6 pounds for our British listeners
6262382	6274433	and that's including Star Wars Pinball, Marvel Pinball, Marvel Pinball Adventures of Virtue, Marvel Pinball Avengers Chronicles, Pinball FX2 Core Collection and Zen Classics.
6275654	6277115	I had a pretty good time playing it.
6277436	6284382	It sort of gave me some of the feel of Pin Mame but not quite.
6285923	6287865	They're all original stuff so it was pretty neat.
6288325	6288746	That's cool.
6288926	6289106	Yeah.
6289986	6299368	Alright, so let's move on a little bit to some actual, I don't know, Xbox rumors, if you will.
6300628	6318391	This week, it was made known that Microsoft has registered the domain for Xbox Fusion, and also some other stuff related to XboxFusion.de, XboxFusion.co.uk, XboxFusion.biz...
6319711	6326576	So, one would think, hey, you know, Xbox Fusion, that could be a name of a console, maybe.
6329018	6335382	So, good chances are that that might be actually what they're going to finally call the console.
6336964	6339766	Maybe a little bit better than Xbox Lube, I don't know.
6340726	6343088	Unless they're having a service called Fusion.
6343869	6364712	uh that's true I guess they could have that as well um but there at least there is something that's going to be you know kind of um relating to the Xbox it's going to be named Fusion so we'll see if it's actually the console or it's not a bad name for a console I guess it could work it just seems like they arbitrarily picked a name out of their asses Fusion sounds cool let's call it that
6365997	6390628	and also there is a rumor that the next or the first I guess debut game of Respawn Entertainment is going to actually be this game called Titan and some information is kind of leaked out about it already saying that the game is going to revolve around these giant mechs called Titans and
6391148	6415855	and so it's kind of a multiplayer shooter game but then it's also got these giant mechs as well kind of think it's like a little bit like mech warrior but maybe more of the scale of it kind of reminds me of like a command and conquer generals and like mech warrior the titan thing is really funny because blizzard has that project titan thing right now now that we all know that's not the real name of the game but it's just funny that like there is a game called titan maybe
6417486	6419547	and then, um, what else?
6420207	6424669	Uh, and apparently the, you know, this might be exclusive to the next platform.
6424749	6427210	I'm assuming it's going to be exclusive for a limited amount of time.
6427230	6430431	I don't know if it's going to be exclusive forever, but probably at launch.
6430791	6433832	And Microsoft's had a few deals like this with the DLC, Windows and all that.
6433892	6434672	Skyrim, right?
6434752	6435072	Had that?
6435993	6436333	Yeah.
6436833	6437613	Um, yeah.
6437653	6438354	Skyrim did.
6438654	6441635	Call of Duty does and, um, did.
6442175	6443635	Grand Theft Auto did.
6443655	6444316	Oh, yeah.
6444916	6445016	Um,
6447336	6448817	There's been a lot.
6449998	6454082	And then, of course, Illumaroom had a new trailer this week.
6454642	6468614	And for those who don't remember, Illumaroom is this brand new peripheral that's going to tie in with the new Xbox and perhaps PCs as well to kind of extend the play field for your games.
6469275	6473118	And the way it's being done, they actually showed the device this time, so we don't have to imagine what it looks like.
6474119	6476200	It's all very prototype right now.
6476801	6481723	But right now, it's basically a projector attached to a Kinect sensor.
6482384	6483945	And the Kinect sensor scans the room.
6484045	6488847	And so it actually will... You can use it for special effects.
6489027	6493090	You can use it to increase your field of view.
6493470	6495031	You can also use it for like...
6496960	6497840	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6515806	6518907	as early as July is when they're going to publicly demo this.
6519367	6522429	And it's not expected to be something that the system launches with if it does eventually come out.
6522449	6525870	Which might have bummed out some people that were kind of looking forward to something like this.
6525890	6527250	The concepts look really cool.
6527930	6541135	I would be worried that if they launched this with a console, which, don't get me wrong, I think if they could get it in the console and have the price of it be cheap enough, because adding a projector, an HD projector, and another Kinect sensor.
6541275	6543997	Yeah, but what if it's not like the images itself?
6544077	6549681	If it's just like colored lights and things like that that enhance the... But it's actually... I mean, it looks neat.
6549941	6550962	I mean, it looked neat.
6551002	6557446	Maybe that's what they're still trying to figure out is the... The problem is though is they envision it as like a projector that sits on a coffee table.
6557506	6561509	So once again, you're talking Kinect sensor... I don't got a coffee table.
6561529	6561949	Yeah, exactly.
6562009	6563130	That's for rich people.
6563270	6564391	I don't have a coffee table.
6564571	6570995	I don't have this... You're limiting it now to, okay, it's going to have this... This thing is going to sit on a coffee table.
6571255	6572096	Hey, hold on a second.
6573236	6576358	If I have to have a coffee table in my room, this projection is going to say... Where do I play Kinect?
6576498	6577119	Exactly.
6577419	6578019	Exactly.
6578340	6581101	But you're telling me to move the coffee table out of the way to play the Kinect games.
6581321	6582122	I'm confused.
6582142	6584343	I am not rearranging the goddamn furniture to play Xbox.
6584363	6586325	What do you want me to do with this coffee table?
6587445	6590387	Microsoft unveils the easily movable coffee table.
6590467	6591008	It moves out.
6591088	6591868	It moves back in.
6591948	6593669	It puts sensors on it.
6593709	6594730	It puts coffee on it.
6595170	6595450	It's great.
6595490	6597372	The Microsoft Transformer coffee table.
6598032	6598853	Coming to you from Ikea.
6598873	6599173	Yeah.
6601505	6602946	That would mean you'd have to build it yourself.
6603307	6606269	And it would have a name like Sfarcigar Devan.
6607670	6608171	Or Billy.
6608871	6609912	Well, that's the bookcase.
6609952	6610212	Sorry.
6611634	6614036	Xbox Fusion is the new coffee table.
6614656	6617098	This system is the coffee table.
6618159	6619540	It fuses to your coffee table.
6619660	6620661	It is the coffee table.
6621041	6622523	It becomes one with the coffee table.
6622543	6624745	It hopefully has nothing to do with Fusion Frenzy.
6625886	6628748	Let's pray, please, that it has nothing to do with Fusion Frenzy.
6629321	6632184	or what if we can see the headlines now.
6632425	6634587	There's a frenzy for the new Xbox Fusion.
6634647	6637731	It's a Fusion frenzy.
6638091	6645139	Breakman in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, Xbox needs to move the coffee table its damn self.
6646060	6647081	That's hilarious.
6647641	6648603	Setting up room for connect.
6651765	6653366	It just knocks over your coffee table.
6654286	6657548	It disappears into the floor with everything that was left on it.
6657948	6659569	It pushes the cat out of the way.
6662570	6668172	With Xbox Fusion's new telekinetic abilities, it can move your furniture for you.
6668832	6670133	Arrange a drone for a connect.
6672353	6673074	That would be hilarious.
6673094	6677556	I want one of those giant holes that opens up in the ground to drop people I don't like out of sight forever.
6677576	6678717	Creating a knee-high wall.
6678837	6679957	Couch moves in the place.
6681218	6682339	Alright, now we're getting stupid.
6682979	6684320	Let's get to the Fugo Question of the Week.
6692301	6695922	Facebook, Google+, slam them together, you get Fugle.
6696002	6697462	It's the Fugle question of the week.
6697642	6701963	Every week we ask a question of our fan communities and read some of our favorite answers here on the show.
6702383	6705484	Again, like last week, way too many answers.
6705564	6706685	I can only read some of them tonight.
6706725	6707365	I'm sorry, guys.
6707725	6711786	Let's start on Google+, with the answer to the question about pinball.
6712466	6715907	DarkSakura likes to talk about pinball a lot on the show.
6716427	6717227	A lot, you guys.
6717467	6718487	She talks about it a lot.
6718908	6720188	She's talked about it five minutes ago.
6721084	6721565	Ice P on Google Plus
6743064	6748505	I think my favorite simulators were Pinball Dreams, Pinball Fantasies, and Slam Tilt on the Amiga.
6750285	6752726	The very first thing a listener named was my absolute favorite.
6752766	6754706	Pinball Dreams was on the PC as well.
6754726	6756226	I know it was more known as an Amiga game.
6756506	6757326	The game was amazing.
6757406	6758747	And Pinball Fantasies was great too.
6759987	6761367	Sorry, I just had one of those random thoughts.
6761547	6761727	What?
6762167	6764208	There's a Commodore 64 set that works for arcade.
6764508	6765008	Just letting you know.
6766388	6767468	Oh, the emulator thingy?
6767768	6768388	I have that.
6770229	6770569	Stoked.
6770629	6772049	Anyway, back to Pinball.
6773088	6775830	How can you of all people change the topic away from pinball?
6776130	6776670	Shame on you.
6777071	6779752	Now we're talking about Dragon Crush?
6779812	6780793	Going back to Ice P.
6782378	6807286	I love the fact that these weren't real tables the way no one could unfavorably compare them to the real thing plus it allowed them the freedom to let their imagination run wild Panaxium says I remember my first pinball game was Moraph's Pinball back on the 386 I was too young to understand how awful of a game that was later I got hooked on Epic Pinball and that was a blast however I don't think I ever had the chance to play a real pinball table really?
6808598	6809980	You've never played a real pinball table?
6810000	6811522	I guess maybe that's one of those things I take for granted.
6812423	6812843	Bars.
6813103	6817729	I mean, maybe you're not like a bar person, but a lot of bars have them, have pinball tables.
6818009	6818750	Bowling alleys.
6818970	6820492	I don't know if that's a thing where you're at.
6820612	6821273	Movie theaters.
6821293	6822094	Movie theaters.
6822154	6824677	You need to... And John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza.
6824697	6826540	You need to go find a pinball table, son.
6827761	6830364	Travis H on Google Plus says, I love pinball.
6830444	6834668	Used to play the Addams Family table until my quarters ran dry at a rec center here in Florida.
6835129	6836810	Also love the Indiana Jones table.
6836890	6838832	I play a lot of Zen pinball on my Vita.
6839173	6843017	Collecting the tables and going back and forth with friends trying to top scores.
6843137	6843838	Great game.
6844589	6845990	Remember Prop Cycle Addams Family?
6846271	6847752	Yes!
6847812	6849373	Wasn't that at California Extreme or something?
6849573	6849813	Yeah.
6849833	6851054	Ooh, we need to figure out when that is this year.
6851094	6853036	Pinnagogo's coming up in a couple months too, by the way.
6853076	6853456	Is it really?
6853536	6853676	Yeah.
6854076	6855337	I need to get these things on the calendar.
6856238	6858640	I just... Isn't... We're taking our jackpot.
6858760	6861342	Isn't California Extreme almost always the last weekend in July?
6861402	6863463	Because I bet you it's the same frickin' day as Clue.
6863564	6864144	I bet you anything.
6864979	6877126	Uh, that might be, but I know that for, well, Pentagogo is the one in Dixon and we're taking Jackbot there because the creator of Jackbot and a bunch of the series is going to be at Pentagogo this year.
6878106	6880428	No, it's July 13th to 14th this year.
6880648	6884690	I'll be in rehearsals that weekend, but maybe I can go on Sunday at least.
6884850	6885871	We should still make it happen.
6886031	6886651	I know, I should.
6886671	6887412	It'll be fun.
6887772	6888233	All right, anyhow.
6889414	6890374	Where were we?
6890454	6891055	We're going to Facebook.
6891095	6892676	Those are some of the answers from Google+.
6892756	6894878	Please check out our community on Google to read them all.
6895258	6898100	And I'm going to read some of the answers here on Facebook as well.
6898861	6902524	Andy R. says, I still don't quite get pinball.
6903004	6903485	Any tips for Andy?
6925448	6927889	There's actually a series of DVDs out.
6928309	6931671	We've got a few of them, but a lot of them have been put on YouTube.
6932431	6935893	It actually teaches you a little bit of the physics involved with a well-balanced pinball table.
6936813	6946318	A lot of it is learning how to catch the ball with your flippers and learning where your triggers are because pretty much it's really just a game of physics.
6947017	6952240	Don't ever... Here's the most common mistake new players make, is that they hit both flippers at the same time.
6952561	6953882	Don't ever do that.
6953922	6958905	The only time that might work is multiball, when it just so happens to be timed that way.
6959245	6964148	But you gotta get yourself out of the habit of hitting both flippers at the same time, and if you can do that, that's the first step.
6964388	6967591	And if you were just trying to keep from draining, keep your eye on the flippers.
6969344	6972885	When you see that ball come into your field of vision, hit whatever flipper it's going towards.
6972905	6973985	Now I want to play some pinball.
6974666	6975226	Come to my house.
6975246	6975746	Damn this question.
6975786	6976026	All right.
6976206	6977006	Come to my house.
6977526	6980087	Jeremy J., my buddy from Koopa Club.
6980107	6981708	I want to give a shout out to that podcast.
6981728	6982848	They're a fun little bunch.
6982968	6985409	They just had a Drunky episode not that long ago either.
6985469	6986049	Those are fun.
6986289	7011018	so looking forward to meeting him in August when they come out here for GamerX but anyway Jeremy J says I'm dreadful at pinball in every form whether it's on an actual table or a digital version that doesn't stop me from really enjoying it though I sunk 10 plus hours into Zen Pinball 2 and didn't even realize it in terms of tables I wouldn't pass up anything horror related would have to get at least one go from me Twilight Zone, Creature from the Black Lagoon etc.
7011118	7013679	Creature is awesome you used to have that one we did yeah
7014722	7015623	Gaming Nerd says,
7030191	7039798	Video game pinball is emulated realism and can still run the risk of a bug in the physics engine used to simulate the ball's movement and hit detection against the bumpers, flippers, etc.
7040238	7045241	Plus, who doesn't love a machine full of flashing lights and that deafening loud knocker when you earn a free game?
7045882	7050025	Not going to disagree with you, gaming nerd, but the real machines can be full of bugs too.
7050965	7051265	DarkSakura.com
7078863	7096751	well we had a mention of Twilight Zone earlier with Twilight Zone they also use ceramic balls for Powerball shut up you guys should see the look on Rob's face it's maybe a little troll face do you shine the balls yourself?
7097861	7098341	You know what?
7098862	7099202	Bite me.
7100002	7106706	But another thing too, tables are actually waxed, especially if they're wood surface tables.
7107566	7108787	There's a lot that has to be done.
7108887	7112769	Even the type of leg that you use, because we have those nice brass ones on the World Cup.
7113450	7114831	Sometimes even the leg you use on it.
7114871	7116912	But so much goes into the balance of the game.
7116932	7119433	You have so many different components to make sure work.
7120514	7126137	Upkeep of a physical table is going to make or break you playing the game.
7126570	7135899	So would you say that after extended play on a wax table that the balls would eventually become wax as well?
7135960	7138542	Breakman in chat says, my balls need a good shining.
7138702	7140104	You can shine your own damn balls.
7143910	7146133	Well, maybe after the show he should just go do that.
7146613	7147454	I don't want to know about it.
7148295	7149016	It's just pinball.
7149637	7149937	All right.
7151078	7153481	VXJasonXV in chat asks a real question here.
7154102	7156344	What is the reason for the free game knocker?
7156525	7157245	That's a good question.
7157286	7159368	Why is that fucking thing so loud when you win a free game?
7159588	7161811	Is that just to draw attention in the arcade?
7162291	7162752	Oh, tradition?
7163392	7163673	I don't know.
7163693	7172999	I think maybe, actually, my thought of it being so loud is that, this is my own theory, is that it's so loud in an arcade that they want to draw attention to that you won one.
7173059	7174220	That's what I figured, yeah.
7174580	7181625	However, we were, I was playing Jackbot last, actually, Deanna, who was one of our DDR friends.
7181665	7182446	Hi, Deanna.
7182526	7183467	Does she listen to the show?
7183567	7184787	Probably not, but hi anyway.
7184948	7186409	She's at a baseball game tonight in Fresno.
7186549	7186849	Okay.
7187149	7188030	It's like, you're going to Fresno?
7188050	7188250	Yeah.
7188749	7189209	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7204955	7210718	and I swear I tilted the machine or I almost tilted the machine just because I wasn't expecting it.
7210738	7212019	It was so loud.
7212079	7217002	That's something that new pinball players should know about too is that tilting the machine is okay.
7217982	7219243	It's about finding the right balance.
7219303	7224606	You can't slam the thing too much but a little smack, you just gotta slap it on the ass a little bit.
7225566	7228048	to get those balls right where you gotta get them.
7228108	7231170	The sweet spot for most tables is gonna be right past the flipper.
7231490	7233091	Tell us about that sweet spot.
7233351	7233831	Shut up.
7234271	7237133	And you use the bottom of your palm.
7237493	7237774	You know what?
7237914	7238174	Bye.
7240375	7241036	And she's left.
7244998	7245879	I can't help it.
7246119	7247960	You're talking about the sweet spot.
7250829	7251649	How about the listeners?
7251709	7253830	Back to the listeners on Facebook.
7254611	7258612	Burr says, My favorite pinball game of all time is Pinball Construction Set.
7258972	7261973	I loved making my own pinball tables on my Apple II.
7262274	7264094	Where the hell is the Kickstarter for a remake?
7264715	7268716	I hear ya, except replace Apple II with Commodore 64, and that was me.
7268976	7269576	That game was awesome.
7269596	7274318	They had a Sega game, too, where you can make a Genesis game that you could make pinball tables.
7274338	7275299	They did, didn't they?
7275459	7278400	I don't remember what it was called, but I remember at the back of the box they had one that was like
7279020	7282762	One bumper and all the flippers you could possibly fit on the screen.
7283282	7283922	All flippers.
7283962	7284723	That is all it was.
7285263	7290565	Fabrice A says, Sadly, pinball machines have become even more rare than arcade cabinets.
7290965	7292246	I do enjoy pinball a lot.
7292706	7294927	Once you know how to score big, it's super addictive.
7295047	7296788	I've played my fair share of pinball tables.
7296848	7301430	Independence Day, High Roller, The Simpsons, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Lord of the Rings, and the list goes on.
7301490	7303591	The one I enjoyed the most was The Addams Family.
7304031	7304912	Very intricate.
7305832	7308614	Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Game of Thrones
7328267	7353873	um Shattered Hawk says the girlfriend and I go to the Nickel Cade about once or twice a month we spend most of the time playing the Star Trek and Addams Family pinball games and lastly Edgar R says I love pinball I never passed up the Simpsons at my old local pub again those are just some of the answers from Facebook and Google Plus sorry I didn't have time to read them all and I tonight I kind of pick people that don't usually get in chat and I don't usually hear from on the show in other ways trying to spread the love around a little bit so uh
7354253	7361183	I do encourage all our listeners though to read the complete list of answers at facebook.com Metallica Pinball is the last one facebook.com they have a Metallica Pinball?
7361503	7368773	yeah they're gonna fuck that up I think they also did a Kiss Pinball as well hold on that's cool alright
7370098	7372019	Let's get back into some other news.
7372079	7373539	Oh, I guess it's my turn for other news, too.
7373639	7377681	Nintendo possibly going into more free-to-play software.
7377701	7388064	I want to say we heard this rumor before, but this is about something that happened with Satoru Iwata, and I think it was in an interview that was actually on Nintendo.co.jp.
7389004	7392645	The company is looking beyond digital distribution and is thinking about free-to-play games.
7393206	7393626	Question.
7394466	7394906	Here's the answer.
7422515	7428619	Also, as you pointed out, we think the digital distribution of package software is only the first step in expanding our digital business.
7429039	7432881	We will not simply change our existing package software distribution channel.
7433302	7437964	Rather, we might have many other types of business models in addition to package software.
7438325	7445989	For example, we might see more games that are similar to free-to-play games, games that cost much less, or games that require a monthly subscription fee.
7446550	7448331	That would be Uncharted territory for Nintendo.
7449071	7463465	Digitalization allows for greater flexibility whereby having more ways to make payments both software developers and consumers have more options and Nintendo 3DS and Wii U have flexible systems to handle such treads so it is now a question of putting these ideas into action.
7463925	7471693	I can definitely say that Nintendo will make new offers that go well beyond simply replacing packaged software with digital software.
7472293	7488973	hmm hmm now that doesn't necessarily mean free to play but certainly they are looking at mixing things up a little bit and not just being digital versions of the same same stuff I think Jamie's next story ties into this a little bit as well so I'll let her go next and we'll come back to this okay well
7489622	7491303	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7507313	7508233	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7522899	7529507	I had no idea that this was... I guess I tweeted about it because I'm like, whoa, the Wii U thing lets you go inside places now.
7529547	7533091	And somebody responded and said, actually, Google added that a while ago.
7533151	7534012	I guess I missed that.
7534032	7535253	But that's crazy.
7535294	7536034	Now, I have to ask.
7536054	7538057	The software I know is free right now.
7538277	7538417	Yeah.
7539838	7541239	But it's not going to be free forever.
7541959	7544141	Is this something that someone would actually pay for?
7544161	7545841	I mean, because it seems kind of dumb.
7546041	7547602	No, because it's a little choppy.
7547742	7548683	I mean, it's neat.
7548743	7550764	It's a really neat concept.
7551544	7556127	But it's probably like internet browser where it's going to be free for forever and then they'll charge for it at some point.
7556187	7557227	That's what I'm saying.
7557787	7560809	Well, they have this other thing that they're charging for that are videos.
7560889	7568793	Like, you can download a video of a double-decker tour thing going through parts of London and you can do the whole pan around with the thing.
7569193	7574118	But they want to charge you like $1.50 for a couple minute, essentially like a two minute video.
7574139	7574839	That's silly.
7575400	7578944	But there's a demo that has a little bit of all of them and that's well enough.
7579224	7579985	Anyway, sorry, Jamie.
7582090	7600542	for people who own a Wii U there is a freebie out there Tank Tank Tank is free on the Wii U eShop and then there's paid DLC and then there's also Kung Fu Rabbit so there also are virtual console updates with other games including and these aren't free by the way
7601022	7603866	Pac-Man and Mega Man are five bucks a pop.
7604808	7608653	And then there were also, let's see, there's some sales.
7608693	7611057	There's Nano Assault Neo, Zen Pinball 2.
7611898	7614762	And then on the 3DS, there will be Bear Shark.
7615223	7615764	Bear Shark.
7616904	7644320	Gummy Bear's Magical Medallion My Writing Stable's 3D Armageddon Operation Dragon Balloon Fight On sale will be Marvel Pinball 3D 3D Classics Kirby's Adventure Dylan's Rolling Western Pushmo Fluidity Spin Cycle Tokyo Crash Mobs Nano Assault EX Art of Balance Touch Fun Fun Mini Golf Touch Cool
7645686	7645986	All right.
7646426	7647287	Oh, I just want to say real quick.
7647367	7648747	I actually played the Tank Tank Tank.
7648807	7654150	I downloaded it because now Nintendo has that cutting edge technology where it finally downloads things in the background.
7654250	7656431	So I just set it up to download the one gig thing, whatever.
7656951	7660133	It's really crippled because you can't even do story mode in it.
7660313	7663514	All you can do is you can do like the versus mode or whatever, like three times a day.
7663935	7664995	And it's kind of silly.
7665475	7667516	Like, there's not a lot to it.
7667576	7671158	I was, I was, you can't do it online or anything.
7671238	7675120	Like, what's the point of Tank Tank Tank with the silly pictures if you can't play it online?
7675240	7675380	It's a
7675520	7675840	DarkSakura
7699236	7700478	I'm sorry, let me put it this way.
7702681	7709831	I think the whole time limit demo thing for multiple plays is stupid.
7710512	7713476	Saints Row, when that first came out as a demo, was a 30 minute demo.
7713697	7714778	I played the crap out of it.
7714798	7716080	I played it over and over and over again.
7716360	7717681	It got me really hyped up about the game.
7717861	7724927	If I was only limited to play that three times a day, say, oh, hey, I want to show my friend this game that's really awesome that I'm super hyped up about.
7725047	7728690	Oh, fuck, I can't play it until tomorrow because they're being fucktards about it.
7728710	7730271	I mean, it's stupid.
7730591	7732433	YY Orange Hat says, got news for you.
7732493	7734995	Tank Tank Tank's retail version doesn't have online play either.
7735355	7739258	You know I feared that, and how derpy dumb is that?
7739438	7743382	That should have been an obvious thing to put in the game, but no.
7743902	7750064	It just seems to me like that's a game though that, and I was excited about it for a while, but it just seems like it would lose something being outside of the arcade too.
7750584	7754065	Yeah, especially when you're sitting in the house playing it by yourself, which is not the same, you know?
7754286	7755886	Well, no one wants to play by themselves, Rob.
7756106	7759267	Well, apparently Breakman does, if you remember earlier.
7759587	7761608	Playing with yourself really should only be like, never mind.
7763148	7766370	I liked playing it in the arcade because I could just reach over and smack Dan in the head.
7767830	7768190	Sometimes.
7768570	7771571	I like taking the pictures with the little wigs and things.
7771771	7773492	Alan said I look like Nicki Minaj in one of them.
7774153	7774574	Great.
7775675	7780801	I actually, one of my old live journal icons is the little tank with the squid in it going, thank you.
7782423	7782643	So.
7783324	7783585	All right.
7783905	7784666	Let's move on, Loki.
7785567	7785947	All right.
7787009	7788010	So, let's see.
7788090	7788230	Let's...
7789574	7790094	Call of Duty Ghosts
7816234	7821680	No Wii U version was announced, and I can also confirm that there is no Wii U version as of right now.
7822200	7827045	Unless it's something that they're saving for some Wii U thing that they're going to say, Oh, by the way, it's Wii U now, too.
7827525	7831069	But I just don't know if they made their money back on the Wii U version.
7831089	7833792	I think that's what a lot of these companies are coming to decide.
7833892	7836034	Like, hey, we're not really making a lot of money on it.
7836154	7836334	But...
7837655	7854646	uh apparently it's going to revolve around you know uh Ghost from Modern Warfare 2 and um they did say that the new on the next gen game or version of the game is going to have a brand new engine current gen version sorry it's going to be running on the same engine that Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3 I think are running on so
7856418	7856878	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7874457	7891709	you know the single player campaign might be cool because now I'm going back and playing through all the single player campaigns from them but as long as the multiplayer is fun that's I don't know I really wish they would just put a multiplayer version of that only make it like maybe half the price or something but then of course they'd be cutting out profits profits profits profits
7893720	7894340	Alright, anyhow.
7895941	7897061	I'm so excited, you guys.
7897101	7900362	It's been forever since we've been able to do a segment like this.
7900982	7904563	The way this segment ties to games is really loose, but you know what?
7904764	7908825	We've got to bring in an opportunity to make fun of local news!
7912296	7913378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7929517	7931498	Trying to win an Xbox Kinect.
7931778	7935959	That's the only way this ties to video games is that the ultimate prize was an Xbox Kinect.
7935979	7940140	But you guys, this story is freaking priceless.
7940160	7941020	It's too dumb to be real.
7941121	7942161	It's priceless.
7942521	7943841	It makes me think of The Onion.
7944061	7948243	Courtesy of ABC40 coming out of, where are they based?
7948283	7948903	Springfield.
7949623	7950623	and Fox 6.
7950743	7952264	I guess they're owned by the same people.
7952344	7952884	So here you go.
7952944	7953764	Courtesy of these guys.
7954324	7955465	A clip from the local news.
7955505	7957585	I've searched years for the perfect mattress.
7957845	7959886	I don't care about the perfect mattress.
7959926	7961086	Mattress hunter.
7961206	7963307	He searched for the perfect mattress.
7963387	7964948	I didn't say local commercials.
7965028	7966128	I said local news.
7966188	7968028	Badly animated flash animation.
7968309	7968589	All right.
7969589	7969849	Here we go.
7971758	7981330	Henry Gribholm says he lost his life savings, $2,600, on a carnival game and all he has to show for it is this stuffed banana with dreadlocks.
7987165	7991909	Gribbom says he attended a Manchester carnival run by Fiesta Shows and wanted to win an Xbox Kinect at a game called Tubs of Fun.
8017927	8019990	It's right next to the pinball.
8020110	8022833	I'm willing to bet it's probably not actually Kinect.
8022913	8027078	I'm guessing it's probably an Xbox console with Kinect, I'm thinking.
8027138	8028700	Because how else could you justify $2,600?
8028740	8030782	I'm thinking that it's a little misrepresented.
8030802	8031102	Tubs of fun!
8036849	8041191	Sorry guys, this is at max volume, so I apologize, this is a little low.
8041271	8041491	Sorry.
8054079	8055641	The balls kept popping out.
8055921	8060786	It's one of those games, it's clearly that game where you throw the baseball into the little, it's like the angled bucket, right?
8060967	8061908	Kind of skee-ball-ish.
8062168	8065652	Yeah, but I'm sure they switched the ball on you at the last minute or whatever.
8065672	8068475	It's not possible that it wasn't rigged.
8070326	8082274	Why do they have this guy walking down the street, pushing his baby in the stroller with this giant banana with dreadlocks?
8082354	8083675	That's what cracks me up.
8084015	8087518	I want to know why they're giving this fuckwad any attention at all.
8088278	8089559	Because it's so ridiculous.
8089859	8090940	Yeah, because it's funny.
8091995	8093476	It's not funny, it's sad.
8093977	8095918	It's like those gambling people, you know?
8096339	8100343	...at $2,300 more, and soon lost all that as well.
8100863	8101964	I know it's a difficult game.
8102505	8103626	I mean, I've tried it myself.
8103686	8105528	I've done it once, missed probably 20 times.
8105768	8111073	Fiesta Show says the game is run by an independent contractor who's worked for Fiesta for years.
8111494	8113956	It's interviewing the contractor to see what happens.
8114349	8116750	Queen Simia in our chatroom brings up a good point.
8116810	8118951	On the plus side, that's a really big banana.
8119691	8120971	Literally, that's what she said.
8136340	8138924	because he's taking a vacation because he's just made $2,300.
8139044	8141107	He's like, fuck that.
8141147	8142209	I can skip this next one.
8142249	8143170	It's the seriousness of that.
8143230	8146795	You will not see tubs of fun or any fun whatsoever.
8147256	8149760	Well, here's... Is this the Daily Show right now?
8152016	8154297	That's why I thought this was onion-worthy.
8155277	8164541	But if I had $2,600 as my savings, and I wanted an Xbox... But Jamie, he was just addicted.
8164601	8166061	He had to keep doubling down.
8166121	8167722	He had to win that money back.
8167762	8170043	And he's a fucking idiot.
8170203	8170623	Allegedly.
8170683	8171643	No, I'm saying it.
8172064	8172944	I'm going on record.
8173324	8178566	In my opinion, sir, Mr. Banana, you are tubs of stupid.
8178926	8198060	and now he has this giant banana he's gotta feed to as well as his children I mean a banana of that size is gonna eat a lot of food Donkey Kong is coming for you that's a lot of potassium and maybe listen to a lot of reggae and smoke some stuff independent contractor that runs the game is not allowed to set up
8198420	8200843	while an investigation is taking place.
8201263	8203365	Because you get caught up in the whole double or nothing.
8203545	8206348	I've got to win my money back.
8206428	8207949	Notice something about this shot.
8207989	8210332	Jamie, I want to point this out to you while this guy is being interviewed.
8210892	8217138	The baby is left alone in the stroller with only the banana to comfort him and he's struggling to get out.
8218359	8219901	Did you see what Bobby just linked in chat?
8220041	8220281	No.
8220341	8220741	Well, what?
8222543	8229049	College Humor wants to pay $2,600 for a giant dreadlock stuffed banana.
8229109	8229469	Of course!
8229869	8230490	Of course!
8230510	8233132	This guy will end up making a profit off this story.
8233152	8234233	He will sell it on eBay.
8234353	8235274	Oh my god.
8235514	8238397	And here we are in debt because of Orange Lounge Radio.
8238417	8239037	He's just an idiot.
8239077	8239698	He's an idiot.
8239818	8241900	Why would you try... I mean, come on.
8242160	8244902	I understand that you may have gotten caught up in the moment, but...
8246123	8246463	DarkSakura.com
8265129	8265549	Yes, you can.
8265990	8266790	Oh, really, bitch?
8267170	8267831	Yes, you can.
8268271	8274956	Well, you can get things that are equally as ridiculous, like Circus Circus and Excalibur have all those little games in the basement.
8275256	8276817	I want to know who... Hold on, hold on.
8276917	8279799	Ragenator in chat says, will he get a hammock for that banana?
8279899	8280680	That's a good question.
8281340	8282361	It's big enough.
8282781	8287684	Blackwolf wants to know, or Blackwolf suggests, we need a giant orange with dreadlocks.
8287885	8288465	Instant money.
8288485	8289065	You know what, Bobby?
8289145	8290646	I can make that for 15 bucks.
8291107	8291507	Okay.
8291787	8292468	I'll do it too.
8292768	8295169	Who designs these stuff things?
8295729	8297530	They're like, what is it, like a dartboard?
8297550	8298251	Really bored people.
8298271	8302133	Like a dartboard that says, you know, fruit and an accessory.
8302693	8307676	Banana, dreadlocks, orange, cowboy hat.
8307696	8308797	They should freaking hire me.
8308897	8310898	I could design some really disturbing stuff.
8310938	8311538	The Chinese.
8312539	8314260	He went back the next day to complain.
8314600	8316441	and the man running the game gave him back $600.
8316541	8319983	See, that's the crazy... The guy gave him back $600?
8320183	8322465	What carny gives you money back?
8323766	8325347	I feel sorry for you here.
8325387	8327088	Yeah, that's where the story gets shady.
8327168	8328689	Why did the carny give him money back?
8328709	8332371	Probably because he's like, I bet my life savings and the guy felt a little bit bad.
8332391	8335373	I mean, how much... The guy is just making cash.
8335413	8336533	I mean, he's not losing any.
8336593	8337994	There's nothing to really run this game.
8338014	8338975	Alright, let's wrap this up.
8339055	8341596	Henry split with the banana and the cash.
8341857	8343778	Ah, thank you for working that pun in.
8344598	8345339	Oh, thank you.
8345359	8348181	I was worried that there might not be a pun.
8348282	8349643	I love you, local news.
8349723	8351444	He split with a banana.
8351825	8354207	And filed a report with Manchester PD.
8354627	8356709	For once in my life, I happen to become that sucker.
8357730	8358751	At least he admits it.
8365134	8365875	Thanks for watching!
8383221	8390266	Dear College Humor, give me $2,600 and I will draw you a banana with dreadlocks.
8390586	8391907	I will go find you that banana.
8391927	8394809	I'm sure we can purchase it on the internet.
8394849	8399973	With $2,600, I'll buy a plane ticket to Hong Kong and go find the manufacturer factory and get one.
8400013	8401654	Let me finish my plea for a job.
8402474	8406977	Dear College Humor, contract me for $2,600 to do nothing but make fun of this guy.
8408318	8410320	I promise you I could do it for days on end.
8411140	8412081	I would never get tired.
8414169	8416811	YYR says that was some hardcore punography.
8418071	8419792	Punography.
8420673	8422094	It would only be if the pun was written.
8423234	8424375	Let's go to the mailbag.
8424415	8427016	Let's see what lovely puns await us in the mailbag.
8428317	8430078	Every week you guys send us emails.
8431179	8436642	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick a few of our favorite emails and read them here on the show.
8436702	8438643	DarkSakura, what do we have tonight?
8439801	8441065	People Trippin'.
8441847	8444796	This one is titled, Damn Used Games.
8446650	8451291	And this comes from someone with a very unpronounceable name, so I'm just going to say, read the email.
8451771	8454032	Hello, OLRcast, my name is Zyle Scott.
8454812	8455092	Thank you.
8455112	8455832	You said the name.
8456133	8457813	He sold me to you.
8457833	8460514	If you put your name in the body of the email, I'm going to read it, okay?
8461274	8472277	I was just wondering if any of you guys know of a website that I could print out cover art for used games that have lost their, it's not T-H-E-R-E, it's T-H-E-I-R, original case.
8473257	8476720	I recently bought a shitload of PS1 games and none of them have cover art.
8477220	8478621	It makes me sad and annoyed.
8479161	8481243	Anyway, thanks and keep on with the great work.
8481323	8481923	Hugs and shit.
8483424	8485486	I don't know of any sites per se.
8485766	8487447	Amazon, maybe, question mark.
8487467	8488268	Not even.
8489028	8490870	Honestly, you know what I do in his position?
8491810	8494612	Just go to Google Limits search and search for the game.
8494892	8495593	Look for large.
8495733	8496474	Look for large.
8496494	8497694	Yeah, and do large.
8498095	8501097	Don't blow up a medium size because it'll look terrible when you print it out.
8501488	8507570	or you can pay me $2,600 and I will go get all the shit printed for you at King Ghost and it will all be nice.
8508671	8510611	You pay me triple that and I'll redraw it all for you.
8511372	8514173	Honestly, yeah, Google Image Search is what I would use.
8514893	8516354	Worst case scenario, Amazon.
8517074	8519595	That's how you find a lot of missing CD covers.
8519675	8522456	But if you don't want it to look shitty, look for Hi-Rez.
8523136	8525138	Queen Simia in our chatroom says, draw your own.
8525198	8525899	Those are the best.
8525999	8527140	Why not?
8527400	8538208	Our Dracula X copy that Krista made us back in the day has her little stick figure Richter Belmont with flaily arms and a whip.
8538329	8539630	No, you know what this guy needs?
8539730	8544273	This guy needs video game covers done in Comic Sans and clip art.
8544854	8544974	Ah!
8545554	8546295	Have you seen this?
8546395	8547075	Yes, I have.
8547095	8548676	That's what you need, sir.
8548756	8554840	You need to just forego the original covers and get comic sans and clip art redoes, reimaginings, because they're better.
8554920	8555641	Do it yourself.
8555701	8556602	It can be a fun project.
8556622	8557162	That's right.
8557983	8558463	Why not?
8558903	8559724	Make the best out of it.
8559744	8561565	For the record, Rob, those make baby Satan cry.
8563726	8564827	Make baby Satan cry.
8564987	8565067	Yeah.
8565087	8566008	Little fiery tears.
8566661	8567622	Little Tears of Lava
8584959	8588944	$150?
8585640	8588944	Well, that guy got a pretty good deal then.
8588984	8590545	No, he didn't.
8591226	8593409	He got $600 of his bucks back and then $150.
8594550	8596372	He only lost two-thirds of his money.
8597113	8598415	For a carnival, that's not bad.
8600285	8602226	and he had tubs of fun, people.
8602466	8604247	Tubs of fun.
8604588	8609890	For the record, I need to find those covers that Krista drew me back in the day and scan them in because they're freaking hilarious.
8610731	8613212	Especially the one for Emerald Dragon that was pretty funny too.
8613272	8617035	Dungeon Buster in chat says someone who missed out on the Ni No Kuni Wizards book made his own.
8617075	8617675	That was awesome.
8619313	8622834	But you can still hire me and I will be more than happy to lay out anything you want me to.
8622854	8623394	Let it go.
8623474	8624195	Get to the next email.
8624535	8627436	Hey, I've actually got a job option.
8627616	8629277	You know what?
8629337	8631978	Just print your own Bananas with Dreadlocks for the cover.
8632038	8633919	Final Fantasy VII, Banana with Dreadlocks.
8634519	8637440	Actually, Banana with Spiky Mohawk for Final Fantasy VII.
8637700	8639081	It has to be crying.
8639861	8643203	This year, instead of Spaced Ponchos, it's all about Bananas with Dreadlocks.
8643723	8644743	That is going to be the new trend.
8644763	8644984	Why not?
8647358	8649739	You know, actually, I was thinking of applying for the River Cats.
8650900	8651160	Oh, yeah?
8651320	8652381	They have a marketing position open.
8652641	8653001	They do.
8653621	8655462	It's a full year, full time.
8655582	8659645	My mom was telling me to go for an announcer position with them some time ago, and I was like, really?
8659705	8660705	Me announcing baseball?
8660825	8662186	Do you really see that?
8662426	8663006	It would be hilarious.
8663026	8667289	I'm the guy, hit the ball, and things happen, and somebody just caught it.
8667349	8668309	Oh, my God, y'all.
8668369	8669730	Balls are flying everywhere.
8674272	8676913	The pitcher just hit the batter.
8677793	8678093	Girl.
8679934	8680434	Shut up.
8680834	8682395	Alright, next email, dammit.
8682415	8683295	We only have one more.
8684236	8685076	Hello, OLR.
8685516	8689157	I've got... What was that?
8689678	8691938	You went high and I lost my shit.
8693459	8695140	I was being nice to the listeners.
8695920	8696840	You said hello, I said hi.
8696860	8697160	Alright.
8699437	8701198	I've got a question for all the hosts.
8701938	8711344	There are many games across all generations that have become known for their final boss fights, such as the Doomsday Zone and Sonic 3 and Knuckles or GLaDOS and Portal.
8711864	8715566	My question to you is which final boss fight in a game is your favorite?
8716187	8725332	As for mine, I know you guys don't like the game getting a lot of praise, but I absolutely love the final fight against Ganon in The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
8726052	8749181	from the moment he transforms into the beast that we knew from the previous games in the series the music sends chills down my spine as well as the setting of a fallen castle is surrounded in both flames and the crashes of lightning and thunder across the sky with Zelda standing watch sometimes screaming in fear when Link takes a blow from Ganon if you need your memory refreshed of why I think this fight is so awesome you can watch it here not clicking the link because I know
8749961	8752043	thanks for reading, Osfer P.S.
8752063	8776264	this email has been brought to you by me and my everlasting love of the show hosted by the gingerbread man I would say that when I was younger like it was probably this battle yes eat your damn vegetables you stupid frog cause the wart battle was pretty epic at that time like this music was just like oh my god he's gonna kill me
8777441	8778924	And then you feed him veggies and it's all good.
8780026	8783472	Otherwise, maybe the Kefka battle in Final Fantasy VI was pretty damn epic.
8784615	8794357	I honestly, not that the battle itself was epic, but the original Metal Gear on the NES, that whole ending sequence was pretty damn amazing.
8795017	8797477	Well, you mentioned the Kefka battle.
8798317	8805719	It was waiting for Shadow at the end of the game that was like the big epic teaser.
8806379	8812740	Honestly, I liked Final Fantasy VII's final battle because it was so fucking easy and I could make a sandwich.
8813460	8814701	while the whole thing was on autoplay.
8815922	8821385	God, there was another one, though, that I remember being completely happy with the ending.
8821445	8824427	More that I was with the last battle.
8824487	8824887	You know what?
8825148	8830831	I always like the last fights, the Wily fights in the Mega Man games because it is the stupidest weapon that you use.
8831011	8832532	Mega Man 3 used Top Man's weapon.
8832552	8833133	The fuck?
8833233	8835014	Bubble Man and Mega Man 2.
8835054	8836855	Yeah, but Bubble Lead was actually useful.
8836975	8841438	Yes, it was, but to shoot it to kill a boss in an empty room, that sucked.
8843552	8847155	Getting Topman and jumping on top of the Wily floater thing.
8847495	8848596	You have to kill him by topping him.
8848756	8849757	You have to top his floater.
8852399	8853780	There was a few.
8853840	8854181	There was.
8854221	8854961	Loki, what about you?
8855021	8855782	Epic boss battles?
8855962	8856402	Do you remember?
8860916	8862898	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade
8883936	8884256	DarkSakura.com
8899256	8900857	Yep.
8901617	8902437	Say your prayers.
8902477	8905539	These guys gave me money to help them beat the game.
8905599	8908660	They paid for me to play as Leonardo because I was the only slot open.
8909140	8911841	And we had just beaten the game and the thing was just starting.
8912181	8913622	And they turned off all the machines because it was time to go.
8913742	8914062	I know.
8914402	8914922	Assholes.
8915322	8916603	I know one epic boss battle.
8916663	8918203	I got my revenge because I got to do the same thing.
8918644	8918884	Max 300.
8918924	8921665	It was pretty epic getting to that.
8923565	8924606	You know, I can consider that.
8924786	8926266	Or, shoot.
8926827	8927547	The Legend of Max?
8927967	8929528	No, um, RoboZ.
8931790	8932591	And, uh, Bust a Move.
8933812	8937475	Because remember that, you're going through the game and everybody's your size and everything.
8939936	8941418	Pull up, pull up, find your soul.
8942438	8942819	Real quick.
8944180	8946742	And for anyone who hasn't played the game, like, um...
8948884	8951868	Busta Move that came out in the U.S.
8953089	8953490	In the U.S.
8953530	8954351	it was Busta Groove.
8955012	8956193	In Japan it was Busta Move.
8962927	8983219	and you're on a building you're this little teeny tiny thing with a robot like this bigger than the building like twice the size of the building it was epic you have cars running off the edges and all this shit and oh my god that was the best game alright good email thank you
8983875	8988539	I'm actually going to say that Robozy is my number one favorite boss battle.
8988699	8989080	Good answer.
8989560	8995725	Alright, if that's it for emails, mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you want to get in on a future email bag segment.
8996746	8998908	Let us get to the FUs of the week.
8998948	9000890	It's the part of the show where we get angsty.
9001010	9001430	Why?
9003072	9003412	I don't know.
9018803	9019284	I have two.
9020225	9021627	The first one goes towards me.
9021667	9022928	I think I'm fighting off something.
9023469	9025111	So I'm just probably going to take it easy tomorrow.
9027214	9036185	Well, I think that I'm just a little worn down because I've maybe gotten five hours of sleep last night and the night before and then went to the baseball game yesterday and was up all night and busy.
9037086	9038007	And actually I have three.
9038747	9042830	It turns out that my wheat and corn allergy is a lot worse than I thought.
9043370	9046972	Which, the only reason I eat anything wheat today is because I took plenty of Benadryl before the show.
9047632	9051034	But I think that it's definitely going to have to get cut out altogether.
9051314	9054756	And I keep pushing it and I'm just happier without it, you know.
9055577	9057038	It hasn't stopped me from having ice cream.
9057378	9059679	I can have ice cream as long as I don't have cookies in my ice cream.
9060800	9061660	Cookies are good though.
9062341	9065102	Rob, I can get gluten free cookies.
9065363	9065723	There you go.
9066597	9073499	and the other one goes towards there not being an actual third Bust-a-Move game.
9075219	9076180	I'm not counting Dance Summit.
9076200	9077480	I'm not counting Dance Summit.
9077680	9080141	We need an actual new Bust-a-Move game.
9080541	9092244	Dear Squeenix, dear squa part of Enix, when you absorbed the Enix to become the conglomerate of Squeenix, you also inherited the Bust-a-Move series.
9092744	9093745	Do something with it!
9094865	9095105	The end.
9095441	9095721	Loki.
9096761	9097762	I feeded your water.
9098362	9101283	I don't know what it is with your water that makes me have cotton mouth.
9102383	9103703	Did you get the stuff out of the filter?
9103863	9104403	That's what you need.
9104763	9105344	Filter water.
9105404	9106284	This is from the tap.
9106384	9106964	I don't know.
9107024	9108504	Don't ever drink tap water.
9108524	9112405	Yeah, they do something to control our minds.
9113706	9114046	Is that it?
9115086	9115667	Yeah, that's it.
9115788	9120216	Oh, and thank you, my son, for trying to hit me in the nuts with the frisbee.
9120717	9122240	Have you ever been headbutted by your son?
9123923	9125125	Yes, but that was in my head.
9127605	9133669	Becky was telling me about when Julian was like two, he would run in while Chris was playing Xbox games and headbutt him in the crotch.
9133950	9134330	Nice.
9134710	9135691	It was an accident.
9135751	9139794	He doesn't know how to throw a frisbee correctly yet, so he threw it behind him.
9139995	9140475	You'll learn him.
9141556	9142196	He's a good kid.
9142477	9151023	Alright, my FU of the week goes to the fact that Alan made all these french fries before the show and I ate them all and this is why I'm fat.
9151464	9153826	But they were so good.
9155512	9160974	Two more stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9161034	9161574	Two more stories.
9161674	9161894	Loki?
9162174	9167055	So, they announced a brand new exclusive game coming to the OUYA.
9167875	9172977	It's being done by Kim Swift and Airtight Games, who did Quantum Conundrum.
9173517	9174798	Soul Fjord Soul Fjord
9203062	9207563	One more story for you guys, and this is about a very interesting demake of a game.
9208243	9210804	And this kind of blows my mind, actually.
9211644	9215545	You know, in China, they tend to do this bootleg software.
9216285	9221727	And a lot of times it's current titles that they cram into these 8-bit carts, and usually they're hacks or things like that.
9221767	9225027	Like, we've seen Tekken, the 8-bit version, and all this crazy shit, right?
9225047	9225848	Tai Chi, the RPG.
9225908	9226328	Yeah, right?
9226368	9227468	Like, all this crazy shit, right?
9227808	9229729	Well, here's an interesting one they did recently.
9229829	9232291	They demaked Final Fantasy IV.
9232671	9234893	Yes, Super Nintendo Final Fantasy IV.
9235393	9238395	They demade it for the Famicom.
9238575	9242578	If you're a smoker, I have a tip for you.
9242618	9246361	Don't play the smoking commercial.
9246661	9248282	That always made me think of Dennis Leary.
9248342	9252505	Goddammit, I just wanted to see the stupid demake and I got a stupid commercial.
9252545	9254006	I want meat from only cows that smoke.
9254722	9255022	DarkSakura.com
9275791	9277711	You can whitelist your favorite internet access.
9277731	9279912	Well, I'm going to blacklist those sons of bitches.
9279972	9282973	But anyway, because if I can't turn the volume down.
9283033	9291115	Anyway, the soundtrack has been shoved into the 8-bit cartridges very well, which is really amazing.
9291215	9294956	And for 8-bit, it looks pretty good, I got to say.
9295336	9299757	They've spread it across three cartridges, though, because, you know, Super Nintendo versus Nintendo.
9300377	9305278	They have the light game, the dark game, and the, I don't know, the end game or something like that.
9305898	9334671	and because you can't transfer saves from one to the other it basically recaps the story when you start one of the and start your characters at an appropriate level so you can play them in any order you want it's just fascinating that somebody did a lot of work to do that for the Famicom cool imagine if they had focused themselves onto like making an original game I know right so there you go who does original things anymore please
9336277	9336737	What the Lump
9352881	9358506	We're going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
9358526	9361468	If you want to give us a call and we can talk about whatever.
9361488	9367693	You want to talk about demakes, you want to talk about remakes, you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight or something else, give us a call.
9367813	9371456	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9371856	9374238	In the meantime, I've got some tweets I want to read for you guys.
9375519	9375679	Hmm.
9403712	9404772	Anyhow, let's go to the phones.
9404912	9405393	It's ringing.
9406633	9407734	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
9407774	9408114	Who's this?
9408695	9409875	It's the one and only Ranma.
9409955	9410816	Hey, Ranma.
9410876	9412016	How you doing?
9412757	9413377	I'm good.
9413597	9414338	I'm good.
9414738	9416779	Did you know that smoking is bad for you?
9417900	9418480	Why, yes it is.
9418520	9420922	That's why I smoke other things, but that's not why I call.
9421782	9423483	An endorsement from Mr. Spanky.
9423663	9424364	Why did you call?
9425919	9426820	Put the coffee on.
9426900	9427540	We gotta talk.
9428821	9429982	I'll get the cheesecake.
9430903	9431904	Fabulous, darling.
9431984	9432564	Fabulous.
9433025	9433505	What is up?
9433665	9434426	What do you want to talk about?
9434946	9440271	Okay, I'm coming home on the train and I tune in right about time when you and Loki are talking about piracy and everything.
9442698	9460153	I understand both sides of this, because even in my world that I cover, we have to deal with entitlement kids who feel that they shouldn't have to pay for anything because it's quote-unquote free and available, but when those series are licensed, they don't want to pony up the 20 or 30 bucks to buy the entire series.
9460433	9461614	And of course, you're talking about anime.
9462394	9462575	Yes.
9463235	9466037	It's coming to the point, it's a financial aspect, because...
9467233	9469175	Truth be told, it's just me.
9469235	9477223	Nobody wants to drop $300 and $400 on a new console knowing that the games are going to be $50, $60, and $70.
9477764	9480406	So if there's a way to pirate it, so be it.
9481287	9489055	And even if the game is like $5, $6, people are still going to pirate it because that's $5, $6 that they're going to keep and put towards something else.
9491912	9493213	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9511795	9515879	I think more people would have bought it at $5 and at $60.
9515959	9518120	More, but would it be 12 times as many?
9518181	9520362	Because it's got to be more than 12 times as many.
9520923	9525747	I really think it is because it's coming down to where it costs consensus.
9525867	9526207	I mean...
9527173	9534418	Most... Almost every single PS3, 360 game I own, I paid anywhere between $20 and $40.
9535799	9541963	One or two, I paid retail price only because it was a game that I wanted or I got a gift card for it.
9542764	9543264	Done and done.
9544906	9545106	Yeah.
9546307	9553972	And as for, you know, releasing the game on the Pirate Bay free like that... See, there's one thing about that.
9555033	9556554	If you see this game...
9557708	9572405	you're going to check the comments within the first 5 or 6 comments somebody's going to be like oh this game has a hack in it don't download, don't download, don't download then you're going to go find another torrent where it's the full game and you're going to grab that
9574019	9581084	Well, what I understand about this particular story, though, is that the author put it up and it was downloaded so many times so fast.
9581504	9585447	You don't figure out what's going on until you've played the game for a little bit.
9586167	9586487	True.
9586928	9595834	Let's say, you know, like within an hour or so, people are going to go back to that torrent and be like, oh, don't download because... Yeah, but in an hour, it's been downloaded 5,000 times already.
9596314	9598415	And the sad part is that that torrent is still going.
9598776	9601698	But if you're smart, you're going to stop that and just jump onto something else.
9601818	9602318	Right, right.
9602838	9602998	Yeah.
9604901	9607104	Alright, well, anything else you wanted to share with listeners tonight?
9609167	9610870	Um... No, not really.
9611491	9611752	I'm good.
9611772	9616098	I just wanted to get that off my chest and agree with y'all about this whole piracy thing, and...
9618930	9622411	Where can I come give you a hug at an anime convention coming up soon?
9622471	9625412	You going to any anime conventions in the next couple weeks?
9625912	9631974	I will be kidnapping the entire staff, putting them in Snake's box, and dragging them to anime next in June.
9632314	9632674	Awesome.
9633374	9634675	I wish you were coming to Fanime.
9634695	9635895	It would give me a reason to go.
9636815	9641617	I know, but I have my own personal reasons that I'm taking time off for this month.
9641937	9643017	I know, I understand.
9643477	9645158	VXJSnakesV is going to be there, so...
9646272	9649134	I'm still unpacking the shoebox studio, okay?
9649394	9649774	All right.
9649834	9650354	Fair enough.
9650454	9650774	Fair enough.
9650795	9651555	Do I have to pout?
9652115	9652315	Okay.
9652335	9653056	She'll do it anyway.
9653636	9653936	All right.
9654416	9655117	Well, take care, Ranma.
9655137	9655617	Thanks for the call.
9656157	9656758	You got it, bro.
9656858	9657098	All right.
9657138	9657398	Later.
9657818	9658719	Later.
9658739	9662261	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9663741	9667523	Also from Tigerclaw, another tweet about Zone of the Enders sequel on hold.
9667543	9672004	The team was disbanded due to issues with the HD remake.
9672424	9673985	Did their zone get ended?
9675045	9675965	Yes, it was.
9676485	9676906	Oh, boy.
9678046	9684228	This is actually from Hideo Kojima himself on Hideo blog, the radio show that he does online, his little podcast.
9685009	9693480	The proposed sequel on Zone of the Enders was ceased, and this was because the HD collection issues were the reasons behind the stop and development.
9693520	9698687	I guess this doesn't mean that it can't come back later, but for right now, nope!
9701031	9701271	Bummer.
9703017	9707702	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
9708843	9718654	SSJ100 Matt tweeted us something about Grant Kirkhope, who's the composer of Perfect Dark and Banjo-Kazooie, I thought you mentioned this earlier, offering their soundtracks up for Pay-As-You-Want.
9718674	9720115	Didn't we have that Perfect Dark story earlier?
9721837	9722778	Or did we skip it tonight?
9723499	9724920	Oh, I guess I didn't show all that after all.
9725180	9727002	Well, I was going to cover this, but apparently not.
9727322	9728342	So you can check this out.
9728463	9733946	GrantKirkHope.Bandcamp.com Pay as you want for Perfect Dark and Banjo-Kazooie.
9734907	9737549	Perfect Dark had a pretty good soundtrack, at least I know.
9737589	9740851	I didn't play a lot of Banjo-Kazooie, but I've played a lot of Perfect Dark on 360.
9742603	9745825	with SSJ100Matt when he had his little trolling device that worked.
9746926	9754190	Redertainment wants to know on Twitter, is there a reason the Christian right hasn't flipped their shit about the various religious comments in Bioshock Infinite?
9755730	9762594	Well, the Westboro Baptist Church is getting ready to protest that Slayer guy's funeral, so that's probably what they're preoccupied with doing.
9762855	9765856	Which, by the way, what a stupid idea.
9766276	9767357	What a stupid idea.
9768037	9770479	Well, I guess I should take a step back even further.
9770999	9795934	How unfortunate that that guy passed away and what sounds like what's really like a freak thing like you first hear that the guy dies a liver failure and he can't help but think oh yeah rock and roll lifestyle right liver failure but it turns out he may have got like a spider bite a couple years ago that led to this because he didn't get a treat like it's crazy stuff I don't know if you guys have read about it very sad stuff obviously Slayer has these hardcore fans that will carve the name of the band into their various
9797878	9801908	And the Westboro Baptist Church is going to go protest this guy's funeral.
9804002	9804522	Good luck.
9805403	9806103	You'll need it.
9806244	9807404	That's going to be violent.
9808505	9809986	But nobody's going to care.
9810087	9811408	That's going to be the hilarious part.
9814890	9816511	Yeah, so screw the Westboro Baptist Church.
9816531	9818793	But anyway, back to the question that was really asked by Redertainment.
9819154	9823677	Is there a reason the Christian right hasn't flipped their shit about the various religious comments in Bioshock Infinite?
9824117	9825478	Bigger fish to fry right now?
9825558	9826399	What do you think, Loki?
9826799	9827900	You've played Bioshock Infinite.
9827920	9829762	Why hasn't the religious right started complaining yet?
9830402	9831763	I don't know why they would complain about it.
9831803	9833143	I mean, it's just, it's fictional.
9833663	9843387	I don't really think it's going to be, I don't know, it's not necessarily like saying religion's bad, it's just they're extreme in the scenarios of the game.
9844147	9846148	So, I don't know.
9846288	9848929	I don't know why they would waste their time on that.
9849049	9850009	I mean, they're not PETA.
9850249	9855691	I mean, I guess, you know, if animals are getting hurt or something like that, then maybe, you know, they'd come after them.
9856158	9859400	You know, for example, if that horse scene was still there, maybe they would come after him.
9861020	9862581	I just don't think they care.
9862681	9863442	Or they're aware of it.
9863462	9864642	You know, they'll bring it up later on.
9864982	9871906	You know, like how those gun makers or whatever get pissed off at, oh, that postal game, it's making people violent.
9871946	9876068	Yeah, wait about 10 years and then they'll finally catch up and start complaining about it.
9876088	9877649	That Bioshock Infinite game is like, what?
9877669	9878009	That's right.
9878029	9880230	They're just now getting around to, you know, Super Mario World.
9880250	9883572	Grand Theft Auto 3 is so violent.
9885154	9887235	All right, I think that was it for Twitter topics tonight.
9887555	9889116	Actually, wait, I want to go back.
9889136	9890317	I thought I saw stuff earlier in the week.
9890677	9896339	Let me go to Loki and ask if you have any last-minute stories first.
9896359	9901982	There is a fan-made Duke Nukem Forever mod being released for Duke Nukem 3D.
9902022	9909626	It's based off the original footage from the 2001 E3 trailer, and you can download it for free.
9910586	9919190	on moddb.com slash mod slash duke-nukum-forever and you just need a copy of Duke Nukem 3D.
9919510	9920651	Can you play that on Steam yet?
9921731	9922211	Multiplayer?
9924132	9926053	You can download it.
9926093	9926633	I'm waiting for that.
9927013	9931135	I found the tweets that I was looking for that I knew had come earlier in the week.
9931255	9933176	Yes, they're all the tweets I'm looking for.
9933776	9935418	YYR tweeted us earlier in the week
9956574	9977900	too soon to tell I get the comparisons with the whole fact that what didn't they also not make Madden on the Dreamcast or one of the big sports games didn't didn't make its way over there and that was kind of the beginning of the end but I think there was a lot of other stuff that came into play too I don't even think it's necessarily comparable because spec wise I don't think it's comparable at all with the next gen systems I think it's more like the current gen stuff
9978380	9980061	It's just kind of an in-between thing.
9980641	9987585	And yeah, it's their next generation of that console, but I wouldn't compare it to the next-gen gaming systems.
9988145	9991827	You're not going to be able to do what they do on those systems on that system.
9992688	9995169	Well, last call for calls.
9995189	9997990	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9998431	9999071	Loki, anything else?
10000492	10002293	Mega Man Unlimited looks cool.
10002393	10003373	They got a new trailer for it.
10003433	10004994	It's another fan-made game.
10007595	10009336	Maybe it'll get shut down by Capcom.
10011457	10013979	Earthbound 4, apparently having a fan game.
10015200	10019484	The creator said on Twitter this week, I want to say, I'm not doing it.
10019604	10020164	Not happening.
10020664	10021785	Very difficult to happen.
10023046	10024928	I kind of think you should never say never, but...
10026889	10028772	getting more games in the Mother series.
10028832	10029753	I guess I should say EarthBound 4.
10029933	10030855	It's technically Mother 4.
10030955	10031235	Sorry.
10031315	10033138	Sorry, Pyrrhus, but Mother 4.
10033218	10034379	There you go.
10034399	10037624	He could very well just put out an EarthBound game.
10038245	10038765	Gotcha!
10039226	10041048	I didn't say anything about EarthBound.
10045399	10047861	Alright, well I guess no other calls tonight.
10048302	10049403	Y'all have been shy lately.
10049443	10051224	We barely got any calls last week either.
10052065	10052686	What's up with that?
10053006	10054748	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
10055368	10056029	If you use it.
10056750	10058872	Alright, I'll shut down the Skype line for now.
10058912	10065398	If you think of something later you want to send us your thoughts, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or of course it's always Twitter.
10065418	10066839	We might stick a banana with dreadlocks on them.
10067239	10068781	Well, I'm hoping the Skype connection works.
10068841	10069682	Maybe something's wrong there.
10069722	10070602	I should have tested it.
10071603	10074726	All right, anyhow, we got what Rama got through, so I know at least one of it's working.
10075567	10076628	Anything else, Loki, you want to get out?
10077989	10078249	Nope.
10078970	10079050	No?
10079771	10081692	Then I guess that brings us to the end of the show.
10083594	10084175	I guess so.
10084595	10089199	A little earlier than usual tonight, but it's only supposed to be about a three-hour show with a break included, so that's all right.
10090100	10095445	I want to thank you guys for tuning out tonight, or tuning out, turning out tonight and tuning in.
10095465	10095965	You're welcome.
10096626	10097527	Now you can tune out.
10098608	10099068	Thanks for watching!
10116908	10119851	Support indie podcasting and help the community grow.
10120291	10123413	And if you want to help our podcast grow, tell a friend or two about the show.
10123954	10125275	Leave a nice review on iTunes.
10125355	10129118	Thumbs up on Stitcher and listening time on there really helps go a long way as well.
10129558	10130579	Really, really appreciate it.
10130919	10133961	Before we close up shop tonight, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10134522	10135543	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
10135623	10136203	Your final thought.
10140146	10140847	Exclamation point.
10141467	10142608	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10143171	10148976	Final thought is I have a lot of money to spend on Amazon soon and I don't know what to get.
10150817	10154720	My final thought is I should have made you buy me that IK and I spent 40 bucks on this weekend.
10154740	10155641	Fuck that, it's an IK.
10155821	10165209	You know, speaking of IK, what they should do is actually come out with some sort of pinball version of it, you know, use the screen as pinball and have the flippers and stuff and have a pinball game that supports it.
10165289	10166510	Now you're talking my language.
10166550	10167010	Yes, sir.
10167731	10168011	Love it.
10168992	10171013	I bet there's a pinball game that supports IK though.
10171614	10171734	Hmm.
10171974	10173655	I would just go with pin maim and leave it at that.
10173995	10174355	Why not?
10174475	10181978	I'm surprised they don't have pin maim on the iPad somehow, even though the Apple Gestapo locks everything down.
10181998	10185999	There is the whole, what is it, just called Pinball Arcade?
10186019	10187179	I don't know if I've got it on here.
10187920	10189580	Yeah, Pinball Arcade, which is pretty good.
10189800	10191641	If it had arcade support, it would be awesome.
10191781	10192141	Be nice.
10193121	10193422	All right.
10194922	10195802	Well, that's it, guys.
10196143	10196563	We're done.
10198383	10200164	That's another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10200424	10201024	Thanks, you guys.

10202884	10203504	Episode 504.
10204044	10206565	I'm hoping we'll have an interview next week, so stay tuned to Twitter.
10206885	10209345	I'll tell you more about that as soon as I have that confirmed for this week.
10209866	10211586	And in the meantime, have fun gaming.
