DarkSakura Chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster says, I thought I saw a tweet where someone wanted to pre-order an Xbox One and the GameStop employee said they don't sell those anymore.

06:08.000 --> 06:26.000
I saw that same tweet. Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says, indeed at least with Playstation 4 people are like, oh it's the new one. Sony just kinda, you know, they took the easy way out but it really works, right? Sony's thing works.

06:26.000 --> 06:44.000
Well I thought the whole idea with calling it the 360 was kinda weird in the first place. I mean it's just, we're used to it now but it's just kinda like, I don't know. You tried going the direction and so now you're going back to the way you were so you made a full 360.

06:44.000 --> 07:01.000
Going back to a classic time for the Xbox, sorry about that. Live Radio. Gotta love it. Let's see, S2100Matt says, I don't even think GameStop sells old Xboxes anymore. No, that's true. BlackWolf says, Xbone for the Call of Duty dog. That could be the name of the dog.

07:01.000 --> 07:10.000
BlackWolf continues on, if the name didn't kill the Wii, the name won't kill the Xbone. I agree, it won't. It is just, you know, interesting.

07:10.000 --> 07:23.000
Alright, so first things first, they get out there and they're talking television, you can watch The Price is Right and you can do this thing with your hands with the Kinect where you make it bigger, make it smaller.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Like, Xbox, go to Star Wars or whatever. No, Star Trek.

07:27.000 --> 07:38.000
Well, the very first thing they show, they show that you can sign on using your voice and it would recognize you. Kind of like what it's supposed to do on the Xbox 360 which doesn't work too well.

07:38.000 --> 07:50.000
It does not work too well. I hate to be pessimistic but it constantly confuses me for Alan. We don't sound that much alike and just because we both have facial hair beards doesn't mean...

07:50.000 --> 08:08.000
I understand tech's a lot better now, so whatever. And then they showed them navigating the interface using swipes of the hand and stuff and then they have this thing where you can basically dock stuff to the side of the screen like you can on Windows 8 or I think even Windows 7 you can do that stuff.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
And so now you can Skype with people while you watch a movie.

08:14.000 --> 08:29.000
Well, I actually find that feature to be one of the more interesting features because I remember when Netflix used to be, well it's still on 360, but it used to have that party mode where you could actually have everybody on the headset and kind of like talk during a movie.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
There was a lot of people that were really into that and were kind of pissed when it disappeared and I don't even think to today we really fully understand why that disappeared.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
It was probably that, you know, it's something we're going to get into later on.

08:42.000 --> 08:52.000
So party chat, not okay, but Skyping, okay. Although I would think maybe you can't Skype during Netflix because that might be too much bandwidth. I don't know.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
You probably still can.

08:53.000 --> 09:04.000
You could probably do at least Skyping while watching a movie, but does that mean you can be synced up with the other... did they get into that? That you and your friend, you know, overseas can be watching the exact same thing, like synced up at the same moment?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't know about that.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
I thought they had touched on that a little bit, like that they could watch the movie together or whatever. I thought they said that.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
I don't know. But here's the thing. It's like they were showing they could bring up Internet Explorer on the side and then you navigate it using your phone.

09:17.000 --> 09:34.000
Or I could just go on my phone and use the browser on there instead of having to use... launch the app for Xbox, you know, Smart Glass and use that as, you know, it's just... it's unnecessary. It really is.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
See, I'm going to be honest, though, is that... and this is just me and my preferences, is that I don't really watch a lot of TV.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
No, me neither.

09:42.000 --> 09:54.000
So when I look at features like that, I'm kind of meh. You know, there's a... I've been catching up on a few things on Netflix, but like live TV, there's very little that I watch anymore. Very, very rare.

09:55.000 --> 10:04.000
Now, I admit being able to have a Skype party during RuPaul's Drag Race sounds really exciting, but I mean, I don't know if it's something I would get a lot of use out of.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Even with an iPad. You could do that right now.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
That's true. That's true.

10:07.000 --> 10:19.000
I mean, it's just... it's a neat idea, but it's just not... I don't think it's something that people are going to use a lot. It's just like, hey, look, Twitter and Facebook are part of Xbox.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Mm-hmm.

10:20.000 --> 10:28.000
Fuck, did anyone use that? No. Once. Hey, look how I'm tweeting from my Xbox. Done. I mean, that was it.

10:28.000 --> 10:38.000
But I do get the idea, you know, obviously... well, to take a few steps back, everything that went on in this conference was very much what we predicted it would be.

10:38.000 --> 10:49.000
And, to be fair, what a lot of people predicted it would be, based on comments from Microsoft themselves, is that it was going to be mostly talk about why it's an entertainment box, and there's going to be very little focus on games.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah, I mean, that's exactly how it turned out. E3's like in a couple weeks. Right. Not a shocker there.

10:54.000 --> 11:03.000
Fifteen games. At E3, apparently. Which is... that's not bad. How many of them are going to get delayed?

11:03.000 --> 11:15.000
Well, in fifteen, here's... and also on top of that, fifteen games, not necessarily retail releases, because now they're considering Xbox Live Arcade and indie games games.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
They're just calling everything games now to make it even harder to find shit. I don't know.

11:20.000 --> 11:30.000
But I wasn't that disappointed that they didn't show anything. In fact, the one new property they showed from Remedy or whatever, it made no fucking sense.

11:30.000 --> 11:39.000
They could have just shown nothing and said, hey, new game from Remedy, and people would be like, oh, sweet, instead of like... Quantum Break is the name of it. Quantum Break, yeah, okay.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
I don't really need, you know... I don't know. It just... it looked weird.

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
I thought it was interesting that it mixed the live action with kind of a throwback to PC CD-ROM to get the taste.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
I don't think that that's actually gameplay. I think that's just the trailer. I just think that... I don't think it was actually part of it.

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah, but I was... okay. I liked Alan Wake a lot. I think it was really underrated by a lot of people.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
By the way, the weekly deal on Humble Bundle.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, seriously. If you've never played Alan Wake or you don't own it, you need to get in on this Humble Bundle. Just tangent. Great.

12:15.000 --> 12:24.000
Anyway, our chat room is lighting up, of course, as you would think, for a topic that's been as hot-button in the gaming community as the Xbox One.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
Tigerclaw says, the one good thing about this conference was that Microsoft actually showed the console, unlike Sony, who just talked about it.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
Well, that seems to have been a mixed bag for them. Let's talk about the look for a little bit. You know, the console's look.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
A lot of people on Twitter I'm seeing going, this thing looks like a Betamax VCR. It's kind of dumpy.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Who cares?

12:44.000 --> 12:51.000
Yeah, I have to... I'm kind of with you. Like, I think people put way too much stock in what the box looks like.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
What does a PC look like? Oh, is that sexy? No, it's a box. Who cares?

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Well, some people go all out on the cases and the lights and the smoke.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Okay, I understand that. You can still do that. You can still add smoke lights and whatever.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
You can put My Little Pony stickers all over the Xbox if you want.

13:03.000 --> 13:10.000
I mean, I don't really care. I mean, who cares if the case is all nice and routed? You know what a rounded case means? I can't fucking stand it up on its end.

13:10.000 --> 13:18.000
Now, granted, this thing is like the size of a VCR, so you probably don't want to stack that thing on its end, but who cares? As long as it's well-ventilated, I don't care.

13:18.000 --> 13:27.000
I'll tell you what was exciting about the way it looks and what have you, which, you know, I'm not... I like that they went minimalist with it. I'll give them that.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
You know, it's a very minimalist look, and I think that's fine. If the thing is just going to sit on your shelf, you know, it doesn't need to be flashy and all that.

13:34.000 --> 13:44.000
And they showed, like, when they were making it and stuff, they're like, okay, here's the system, here's the drive, here's the chip, here's that fucking huge-ass heat sink and a giant goddamn fan on top of it.

13:44.000 --> 13:52.000
This shit will not over... Oh, and by the way, half of the console is a vent, and the other half is more vents. It's like, I don't think it's going to be a problem.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
Yeah, and actually, the thing that excited me most that they said about it was that it's silent. Yay!

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Or pretty close to it, yeah.

13:58.000 --> 14:06.000
Because the old 360s, oh my gosh, those things are... Like, I still have one of the earlier model 360s, and that thing, it still sounds like a freight truck when you turn it on.

14:06.000 --> 14:15.000
Like, it's really loud and noticeable. So, to me, that was the most exciting part. I don't care what it looks like, just shut the hell up when I'm trying to watch a movie, right?

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
DungeonBuster in chat says, I'm just hoping it doesn't have the same hardware issues the 360 did early on.

14:21.000 --> 14:36.000
No, I mean, we're talking, like, how many advancements in chips have there been? It's running such a... Was it a 28... It was a 28-watt chip or a 28-nanometer chip now? I mean, they're really low-watted chips now.

14:36.000 --> 14:45.000
I'm a valid concern, in my opinion, with how bad that Red Ring affected people, and not just that, but there's been a lot of tiny little stumbles along the way for Microsoft.

14:45.000 --> 14:57.000
I'm not trying to, like, just, like, you know, pee all over them or whatever, but, you know, the reality is Xbox Live got broken in two somehow, and a ton of people had money stolen, including me with their live accounts or whatever.

14:57.000 --> 15:13.000
I personally had two Xboxes that Red Ring and had to be sent back. You know, there was those issues, and I understand Sony has issues, Nintendo has issues too. I haven't personally experienced any of them. Those consoles still run like rocks. My PlayStation 2 is still flawless, pretty much.

15:13.000 --> 15:27.000
So, I think it's a valid concern. Now, I'm optimistic that Microsoft's learned and so forth, and I don't think we need to necessarily hold the past against them, but I understand where the concern comes from.

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
It's been a while. I did like the new controller.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Yeah, I was gonna get into that next. The controller. What'd you think?

15:37.000 --> 15:47.000
I liked the idea of having, like, actual rumble in the triggers. I think that's kind of a neat innovation, I guess. It looks like they fixed the D-pad, so that's good.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Thank God.

15:48.000 --> 16:06.000
Everything else is pretty much the same. Battery compartments integrated inside the controller, which at first was like, oh, sweet, built-in battery like the PlayStation 3, but no. No, it's actually, it's, you know, a compartment where you can put AA batteries and stuff, so I'm a little disappointed about that, because those batteries die so fast.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
I just was hoping it would be more integrated, but maybe they keep the cost down or something.

16:10.000 --> 16:19.000
Maybe. Yeah, you would think that they would kind of have taken the charge idea from the PlayStation 3. I mean, it's so freaking convenient with the mini-USB. It's, I love that.

16:19.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah, so that's a little disappointing, but I mean, it looks nice. I don't have a problem with, you know, how it's, you know, it's a little bit bigger now, but whatever. It's not that big a deal.

16:32.000 --> 16:46.000
Now, I did not remember hearing this when I was watching the press conference. This is one of those things that came out after the press conferences, a lot did, but what's this whole thing? It's supposed to measure your vitality, like the Wii Vitality sensor, the heartbeat thing is in the controller?

16:46.000 --> 16:55.000
No, the Kinect sensor can do that, because it's that sensitive, because it can actually see your heart rate based on, like, your veins pulsing on your face. Yeah, it's that detailed now.

16:55.000 --> 17:05.000
That's, well, the skeptic in me is wondering about that, because, you know, I thought this first Kinect was supposed to do so much and be so accurate.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
That Kinect sucks. I'm selling mine, by the way, so I'm getting rid of mine.

17:10.000 --> 17:18.000
Yeah, but I'm just, I'm just kind of like, I don't know, there's a skeptic in me that's like, I like to play video games in the dark. It's going to see my heartbeat in the dark.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
It's infrared.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
It can still see all, that's just, that's crazy.

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
It's infrared, and remember, now they have the new technology, it was a time of flight with, you know, the photons where it measures the actual distance and stuff with that.

17:30.000 --> 17:40.000
I think that's all great and stuff, but I don't like what they're doing with it, and a lot of this tinfoil hat stuff starts making me wonder, because think about it.

17:40.000 --> 17:50.000
They have this new technology now that's the time of flight stuff, so it's going to look at, you know, it's not going to just recognize you based on a picture, it's recognizing you based on like a 3D image of yourself.

17:50.000 --> 18:02.000
So, and remember, they patented something a while ago where it was going to be able to enforce like, was it the public screen things, the movies, or whatever.

18:02.000 --> 18:09.000
So if like you have like a bunch of people in your house and you're watching a movie, it's like, oh, nope, sorry, too many people watching this movie at the same time type thing, you know.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
No, they would not do that.

18:11.000 --> 18:23.000
They have a patent for it, why would you get a patent for that? I'm just saying, it's not necessarily something that they will implement, but, and then also I worry too that, like say for example you're sharing your login with a friend or something like that.

18:23.000 --> 18:30.000
Hey, you can log in on my account and play my game, it's going to look at your face, I'm sorry you don't look like that person, sorry, not going to let you log in.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
I'm worried that that's going to, that they're going to try to do that, lock it down somehow, so that you can't account.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
But people change, you know, what if I want to shave my beard off?

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
But it's not going to look at your beard, it's probably going to look at proportions, like proportions between your eyes, between your lips.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
What if I lose a ton of weight?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I don't know, I don't know how it's going to work.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Or gain a ton of weight the way I'm going.

18:53.000 --> 19:05.000
I'm just saying that, you know, I'm very, I'm very worst case scenario with them, because I don't, especially after the whole rumor, and I don't even know what's going on with this now,

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
because everyone's contradicting everyone else about the whole not playing used games, well not necessarily, it plays used games, okay?

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
Basically, all the games that you play have to be installed to the hard drive, fine?

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
Let me take a step back for a minute, because all this came out after the conference, so let's take a step back, finish up, we'll win out of the conference,

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
and then, because that's a very important point, is that there's a lot that came out that wasn't even set on stage.

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
Yeah, the conference was awesome, like after the conference, before I heard any other information, I'm like, yeah, this is pretty awesome, I have to get one of these.

19:33.000 --> 19:42.000
So, let's see, some of the stuff they showed that was game-wise, fours of five, expected, part of the course, looks nice.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Quantum Break, I think we already talked about.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
EA Sports Partnership.

19:47.000 --> 19:54.000
Well, they are going to be big sellers, it was interesting to see EA get out there on stage and pledge their full support to Xbox,

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
I think I said something on the last show about that too, where, you know, they did that for Wii U and then totally just, you know,

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
turned around and went to go to bed with their new buddy Microsoft, which is kind of funny, the way that all played out.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Which only made the news after the show more, yeah, we kind of figured that was going to happen.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
And then Call of Duty Ghosts, which, I'm not so big on that series, but you are, so what did you think?

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
I didn't really understand, like it didn't really make any sense to me, it wasn't like, no, I mean honestly, it's just like,

20:24.000 --> 20:31.000
you know, Black Ops 2 looked pretty awesome with all the drones and stuff, and that kind of, you know, that was something that made me kind of excited about the game.

20:31.000 --> 20:38.000
This one doesn't really, other than, okay, stuff's kind of post-apocalyptic a little bit, and there's a dog.

20:38.000 --> 20:45.000
Like, I didn't really get what it was about, so I don't really understand. The dog thing I think is kind of neat,

20:45.000 --> 20:52.000
but, once again, you know, I'm not going to be pure mulanode over this crap, I'm not going to be like,

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
oh hey, I gotta get fabled because there's a fucking dog in it, and wait, the dog's kind of annoying.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
It's like, I don't know, I don't think it's going to be that big a deal, and they're going to fucking kill the thing off,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
you know they're going to kill the dog off, they always kill the dog off.

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
Or, if it's not this game, it's going to be in like a game or two next, you know, they're going to kill that dog.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Something's going to happen to that dog, that dog is not long for this world.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Save the dog! Hashtag save the dog.

21:19.000 --> 21:28.000
Alright, um, let's see, one of the other big things, sorry, I'm distracted because I see something in chat here,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Alan says, earthquake in Sacramento, is there a joke, is that a joke?

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
I did not feel an earthquake if there was just an earthquake, I don't know, anyway, the joys of live radio.

21:38.000 --> 21:46.000
One of the other big things I wanted to bring up that they talked about on stage was the Halo TV series.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
So, now it's no longer a movie we're talking about, it's a TV series we're talking about.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
So, Steven Spielberg, executive producing.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
That could be good to me.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
They had that gal on stage that used to be with CBS and all that, I remember hearing that they had hired her

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
and she was going to be working with the Xbox, you know, content delivery.

22:06.000 --> 22:13.000
I was surprised we actually didn't hear more about that whole thing, and I'm not necessarily talking about the Halo TV show.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
In talking with some people, it seemed a little unclear at first, is this something that's going to be on TV,

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
is this something that's going to be a Netflix Hulu thing, but I think, you know, going back and watching it later when I did,

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
it seemed pretty clear to me that they are going to launch some type of video on demand service,

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
which, well, I mean, they already have a video on demand service, but Xbox original programming or something is going to be built into that,

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
and this Halo would obviously be a huge staple in that, with Steven Spielberg's name on it.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
Steven Spielberg, his TV series, especially the ones that have been on, I think he had some on Showtime or HBO

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
or something like that, like the Band of Brothers, I think, was one of his, are really good.

22:55.000 --> 23:05.000
I mean, they're really good war dramas, so, I mean, assuming that it's treated nice, maybe not so much like that,

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
was it the, what the fuck was that, Forward on to Dawn, Forward on to Dawn was kind of cheesy,

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
but, you know, assuming it's better than that, I think it could be pretty awesome.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Am I going to watch it? Probably not.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
What if you have to pay for it, though?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Nope, definitely not going to watch it then.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Huh.

23:23.000 --> 23:30.000
I just, I'm not a huge fan of Halo, I just, I'm not going to seek out this TV show, it doesn't really appeal to me.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
It's neat, though, that they're, you know, they're going to talk about doing something like that.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
What else might they be working on, you think?

23:38.000 --> 23:46.000
Um, maybe some more, like, Xbox-centric news shows, because remember they used to have, like,

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
a bunch of, like, their kind of community blog stuff, almost, on there.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
Like, I think they even had some with, like, Major Nelson, and that's, I don't know if that's still there or not.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
But, maybe something like that?

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
I'm not really sure if they would have any more TV shows based on their properties.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
I don't think I'd want to watch another, like, you know, maybe if we do, like, a Steven Spielberg Halo thing,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
we can do, like, a Michael Bay Gears of War or something, you know?

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Or a Michael Bay Crackdown, that would be awesome.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Is this something to enhance Xbox Live, possibly?

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
Like, this will just be, if you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber, it's a free thing for you.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Maybe.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Maybe.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
Uh, by the way, not to get derailed by this, but yes, there was just a 5.9 earthquake up by Susanville,

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
which is a ways away, that's like, you know, three hours north, but I guess they're feeling it.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
I didn't feel it! What's up with that?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Weird.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
Alright, thanks for derailing the show, earthquake, what are you trying to say?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Oh, man.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Don't do a show on Thursdays.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
Um, okay, so, did that pretty much cover everything, at least from the press conference itself, I think so?

24:52.000 --> 24:59.000
Um, yeah, and then of course they said, you know, was it 15 games or something?

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah, which we mentioned a little bit ago, which, you know, more to come at E3.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Yeah.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
So, um, so that leads us to everything that started to come out after the fact,

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
which just started to get weirder and weirder.

25:12.000 --> 25:20.000
Um, one of the big things that came out right off the bat is that the Xbox One will not be backwards compatible with Xbox 360.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
You will not be able to play the games, you will not be able to play the download games,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
and assumably that includes XNA and what have you.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
I'm not surprised.

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
And, uh, it will, however, be cross, or backwards compatible, if you will, with any videos that you've bought.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Music that you've bought, and so on.

25:38.000 --> 25:46.000
Obviously, this ties into the fact that the Xbox One is using a new chipset, which the PlayStation 4 is doing the same thing.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Although, on the PlayStation 4 side, you kind of go, well, use the Gaikai thing to make some magic happen.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
But they're not necessarily, they're going to offer that later on, but it's not going to be like,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
hey, you bought this title, now you get this game free. I don't think it's going to be like that.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Right.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
It would be nice. It's not going to happen that way, but it would be nice.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
So there will be no backwards compatibility, which, you know, I realized that most of the,

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
you know, PlayStation 3 wasn't backwards compatible, Xbox 360 had limited backwards compatibility.

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
Well, the PlayStation 3 originally started backwards compatible, but, you know, then it slowly went away.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

26:20.000 --> 26:27.000
It's harder to create a system with, you know, you can't, they don't have an Xbox 360 on a chip right now.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Right.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
And to, you know, do that, it's just going to be hard to emulate that.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
You're basically creating an emulator for this thing, and it's going to be difficult to do that.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
Do you think that decision is going to hurt, though?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
No.

26:40.000 --> 26:48.000
I'm kind of with you because, I mean, PlayStation 4 is in the same boat, so it's not like one does it and the other doesn't.

26:48.000 --> 26:55.000
But I just think the odd, or the thing to be concerned about is that, you know, again, this year, at the end of the year,

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
when these consoles are launching, you still have a lot of good stuff coming out for the current gen.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Yeah.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And people that buy that stuff aren't going to be able to play it on the new consoles.

27:03.000 --> 27:10.000
And here's the thing, too, like, you know, don't think that you have to buy one of these new consoles right at launch.

27:10.000 --> 27:18.000
I mean, I kind of want to, but I'm not really forcing myself to do that because, once again, any of these games that I want to play,

27:18.000 --> 27:25.000
like, say, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5, only on, you know, the current gen stuff, you know, but other stuff like Assassin's Creed 4,

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
Battlefield 4, Call of Duty, you know, all that stuff is going to be also on current gen.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
Or even if you want to go further, Destiny is going to be on current gen as well.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Was it Watch Dogs current gen?

27:39.000 --> 27:46.000
So I don't need to buy a new console to play these awesome games. I can just wait.

27:46.000 --> 27:53.000
And let's be honest, the new consoles that come out that have these games on them and then also have them on the current gen,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
they're not going to be that drastically different.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
I mean, hell, they've shown gameplay from, like, the PlayStation 4 of Assassin's Creed 4.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
I can't tell the difference between that and the PS3 version.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Apparently there's some better physics. I can't tell the difference.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
So, I don't know.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
And let's assume, you know, these games are still coming out at $60.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
So are they going to price the PlayStation 4 and, you know, Xbox One games the same thing?

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
I don't think so. I'd be surprised if they're the same price.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
If anything, I think they're going to be, like, $69.

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
Although, I have been receiving some temporary pricing from Ubisoft.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
It shows $99, but there's no way.

28:33.000 --> 28:41.000
I have a feeling the MSRP for, you know, games, I think that maybe hasn't been determined yet.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
I don't think so either.

28:42.000 --> 28:51.000
I tend to think they're not going to bump up the ceiling simply because they're making extra money on collector's editions and DLC.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
But, I mean, I could be wrong, of course.

28:54.000 --> 29:02.000
But I kind of think it would be a very slippery slope if they were to bump it up to $69.99.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
They're already talking about, was it, Battlefield 4.

29:05.000 --> 29:12.000
They already announced the pre-order DLC campaign that's going to be added on already.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
And, you know, the comment is like, why don't you just include that in the regular game then?

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
If you're already announcing this and it's already being worked on, why is this not being included in the game?

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Right.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Yeah.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Okay, then the biggie.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And this is the one that everybody's talking about.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
And I'm not even sure I can make sense of what the hell is happening with this news.

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
Microsoft's not giving a clear answer on it and they pretty much have said that they won't until E3.

29:40.000 --> 29:50.000
And I think this whole thing started with a post and surprise that, you know, this came from Kotaku that started a crazy wave over the internet.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
No, it wasn't Kotaku.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
Well, I'm thinking of that interview that they had with Phil Harrison, right?

29:56.000 --> 30:05.000
It started with Wired Magazine got the exclusive interview or whatever with Microsoft about their Xbox One console.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
They were the first to have everything and then it kind of spun off from their people asking follow-up questions about that.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Okay.

30:11.000 --> 30:22.000
So, they first, it talked about how the console will play used games but will require you to pay a fee in order to use that disc a second time.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
So, that, it just, okay.

30:27.000 --> 30:38.000
First off, I don't know even if this is going to happen because they keep going back on it and, you know, the Xbox support Twitter saying no, it's completely wrong.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
We're trying to get them to remove that story.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
It's completely inaccurate.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Yeah, a quote from the Xbox support account.

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
I understand your concerns but can confirm that any information for fees for used games is incorrect.

30:49.000 --> 30:58.000
So, I don't know if, and a lot of these people asking the same question to these guys, they're phrasing it in a very careful way.

30:58.000 --> 31:06.000
You know, when they're asking about can I go to my friend's house and, you know, play my copy of a game.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
They're like, yes, you can go to your friend's house and play your copy of the game.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
You can install it to their drive but you have to log into your account to do that.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
You can't just loan them the game.

31:16.000 --> 31:23.000
So, what they're, what's happening right now is basically it sounds like every game is going to have a code that comes with it, kind of like the online pass.

31:23.000 --> 31:28.000
Basically, that code is going to lock that game to your system.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
So, you install it, you give them the authentication code and then you can play the game without the disk anymore.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
The disk is basically you don't need it.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
Now, what they haven't explained is what happens when you give that disk to your friend and they don't have a code.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
Now, originally they said, okay, you're going to have to pay full price.

31:45.000 --> 31:51.000
And this is coming from an interview from higher up saying this, that you're going to have to pay the full price of the game to play it on your system.

31:51.000 --> 31:56.000
Now, I took that as you're going to have to pay the full price to play that game on your system without a disk.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
I don't understand why they can't do it, you know, okay, you can play the game off the disk.

32:02.000 --> 32:09.000
But I understand why they're doing that is because, you know, I could buy it, load it on my system, play without a disk, give it to my friend, he plays with the disk.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
You get two games for the price, one basically, so they can't do it that way.

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
And I think I'm hearing something about the installation is being done because Blu-ray drives are too slow.

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
Yes and no. I mean, yes, I understand that they're, you know, but that's fine.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
Forced installation is fine, then why do we need the one time use code?

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
If that's DRM, that's all it is, it's DRM, it's not...

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
I understand the drive is slow and that you can force that, but you know what?

32:37.000 --> 32:43.000
Right now I have my Xbox 360, I install games to the hard drive and the disk is in the drive.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
It reads the disk for a little bit to authenticate that you have the disk, then it runs it off the hard drive.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Why can't we do it the same way? I don't understand why we can't do it the same way.

32:50.000 --> 32:56.000
Because they want DRM. They want the DRM in there because there's hacked drive firmwares.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
They don't want to even mess with the hacked drive firmwares, they're going to, you know, nip that in the butt right away.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
Why wouldn't there necessarily be hacked things that will dodge the authentication servers?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Hackers going to hack, right?

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
I understand that, but right now they're treating you as pirates.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
That's how they're treating you out of the gate. They're treating you as a pirate.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Because they're putting this extra piece of DRM in the way.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
I got to put a code in now that, you know, play my game.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
And see, what they haven't explained right now is that how are you going to revoke that if you...

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
They said they're supporting used games, okay?

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
Let's pretend that this is actually a one time use code like it is with the online passes.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
Then when I sell it to GameStop, as this current scenario is right...

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
As they're explaining right now, and granted this is going to change at a drop of a dime.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I sell this back to GameStop.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Why are they going to buy it for me first off?

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
Because if anybody takes that game and tries to install it, it's going to ask them for 60 bucks.

33:46.000 --> 33:53.000
So, you know, you're essentially killing used games even though you can pass it off to a friend and they can install it for the full price.

33:53.000 --> 34:00.000
So, there's got to be something in the way of where you can revoke your, you know, license or whatever on that.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
But, once again, that's going to require that code because unless there's a code somehow on that disk...

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
And I don't know how that would even be accomplished because...

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
I don't even know. It doesn't even make sense how that would even be accomplished.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
Unless there's like some RFID tag or something like that, which can be faked.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
You could fake that.

34:19.000 --> 34:24.000
If it is tied to that code and I lose that code, then how... Is that disk useless now?

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
I can't use that disk because I don't have the code to install it? I don't understand how it's going to work.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
I want to go back to something that was said through an official channel.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
And this was on majornelson.com and he's, you know, kind of the mouthpiece for Microsoft.

34:35.000 --> 34:44.000
And during all this, you know, craziness about the used games, he released a statement on his blog that says, quote...

34:44.000 --> 34:51.000
We know there is some confusion around used games on Xbox One and wanted to provide a bit of clarification on exactly what we've confirmed today.

34:51.000 --> 35:00.000
While there have been many potential scenarios discussed, today we have only confirmed that we designed Xbox One to enable our customers to trade in and resell games at retail.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
So you will be able to use GameStop somehow in this.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
Okay, yeah. I understand that they have it so that you can trade in your games and resell it.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
But if it's worthless, I mean, hell, you can, you know, if it's...

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
Yeah, but I don't think you say that if it's worthless. Like, there's something there.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
Yeah, so there's something there, but it doesn't make any sense that it has to be this complicated.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Make it as easily... Why can't it be the same as it is now? I don't understand why they have to do that.

35:25.000 --> 35:31.000
Oh, I know why. It's because they got pressured by EA to do this. How do you think they got their silly little EA partnership?

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Oh, it's because they fucking implemented this shit.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Hold on, though. Let me play devil's advocate for a minute.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
Now, Tim trips in our chat and says there are a lot of other really good reasons to play off a hard drive besides DRM.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
And one thing I can think of, you know, you might... Hold on, hold on.

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
One thing I can think of is that on the 360, there have been problems when some people use the disc,

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
some people install to the drive, and sometimes one is too slow, one is too fast.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
You know, there were problems when people were installing certain games and so forth.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
So this is kind of one way to level that playing field.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
I have no problem with installing to the hard drive. I think that's a great idea.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
I install all my games to the hard drive anyways because, yes, that drive is loud, it's slow.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
That's fine. I have no problem with that. I have the problem with the one-time use code.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
That is my problem right there.

36:15.000 --> 36:21.000
Yeah, but then how... I can understand how do you stop, you install it, and then I take it to my friends, they install it.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
It requires the disc and the drive. Just like it is now. Require the disc and the drive. There you go.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
It doesn't have to... It just spins it to check that it's there, and that's it.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I don't understand why it has to be any more complicated than that.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
They're making it complicated because they're fucking treating it...

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
Didn't you just say that somebody's worked around that system on 360?

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
Yeah, they've worked around it and they patched it, but you know what?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
It's a different story now. We're talking a new console.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
And assume that everybody is... I mean, not everybody is doing that.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
We're talking about people that are pirating games, a small minority are doing this.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
And you're treating everybody like a pirate.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
I'll agree with you to the extent that if a small minority figured out a way to work the system now,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
that same small minority is going to figure out a way to work the system then.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
They're going to figure out a way. Yes.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
So, I'll meet you to that point.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
Let me read the rest of Major Nelson's statement.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Beyond that, we have not confirmed any specific scenarios.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
Quote, another piece of clarification around playing games at a friend's house.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
Should you choose to play your game at your friend's house, there is no fee to play that game,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
while you are signed into your profile.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
That was the end of the statement.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
Well, yeah, there's a lot there that's unsaid.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
It's kind of like, you read the inverse of that.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
They're treating all games as a digital download.

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
But whether you're digitally downloading it off the disk or downloading it off the internet.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
The problem with that is, I like that you want to treat it like this,

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
and this is very idealistic of Microsoft to think this way,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
but that's not how the fucking world works.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
It's a goddamn physical disk.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
If I'm downloading it off the internet, yes, I can't sell that used because it's a digital copy.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
It's a physical copy. I'm holding it in my hand.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
It is a disk.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
That's why a lot of people like to do physical copies.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Especially when you're talking about $60 or $70 a game,

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
some people like to have that equity where they know they can sell it later.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
There are a lot of people that buy games full price and then sell them for whatever,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
you know, nickels and dimes they can get to get some of their money back when they beat it.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Exactly. And here's my thing, it's like,

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
it's very idealistic of them to think that they can pull that off right now.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
You know what? Maybe you should wait another decade or so

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
where the infrastructure's in place to where that actually is a thing

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
where you can download games and it's very effortlessly.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
But right now, it's not there.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
And you can't think that you can pull this off if...

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
I'm sorry, it's just you can't do this.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
They're gonna try to do this, but you know what?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
If not everyone is on board, it's not gonna work.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
And if PlayStation 4 is on, and you better believe,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
PlayStation 4 is probably thinking the same thing,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
but they're like, you know what?

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
We may have made this deal before, but we're not sure if we're gonna do this.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
And I was reading this in chat earlier and I apologize,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I don't remember the specific names of the people saying this,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
but some people were talking about PlayStation 4

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
and could Sony actually have this exact same system in place,

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
but they're letting Microsoft take the heat for it?

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
Don't get me wrong, I think that both companies met together

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
and agreed on something, and I think EA started it.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Tinfoil hat, if you will.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
Because I think that that is why...

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
EA wouldn't just drop it if one company was doing it.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
They would say, okay, yeah, we're not doing it on the 360 or the Xbox One,

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
but we're gonna do it on PlayStation 4.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
So everybody's on board with this because that's the only way it's gonna work.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
They're not counting Nintendo because Nintendo doesn't...

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
It's just, you know, whatever. It doesn't even matter.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
It's so small, it's no big deal to them.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
So they're all on board with this.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
However, I could see one of them or both of them backing out of it

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
because of the backlash of it.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
I have to go here now, and a lot of people in our chat room,

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
starting with Slidekick, are going here too,

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
is about, well, isn't this interesting now?

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
Let's say your little tinfoil hat, you know, locked boardroom,

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
locked boardroom scenario, EA sat Sony and Microsoft down

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
to mutually agree on this or whatever.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Who has EA recently apparently turned their back on? Nintendo.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
Doesn't this put the Wii U in this really interesting situation now

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
where none of this fuckery exists there?

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
And despite all this talk about, you know,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
where the Wii U is in this horrible place and da-da-da-da-da,

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
suddenly the Wii U has got the system we all want.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
To be able to trade games and rent games?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
No, here's the thing, though. Here's the thing.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
It's like, you don't have to do any of this.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Hello? You don't have to buy any systems.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
You don't have to pick one of the three consoles.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
It's not like, make your choice, you know, and that's it.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
You've got tons of choices. You can go PC.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
You can keep the consoles you have now,

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
because I'll bet you they're going to keep supporting those consoles

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
if no one's buying the new ones.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
And, you know, like I said, if you want to buy the Wii U,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
cool, buy the Wii U, but I don't think that all of a sudden,

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
for me, why would I buy the same console

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
that generates pretty much the same type of graphics

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
as, you know, I'm not gaining,

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
there's nothing really to gain for me from the Wii U.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
But I'm just saying that why,

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
you don't have to buy these new consoles, that's the thing.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
It's like, I don't have to put up with this bullshit.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
You want to go ahead and try to implement all this stuff

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
where I can't sell games?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Hey, you know what, I can't sell games on Steam either,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
but here's the thing, Steam drops the price of their games

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
very frequently, and I get some really good deals,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
and I buy games that if on console,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
you know, I probably wouldn't be picking up those games.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
I can honestly say, you know, I get the Steam comparison

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
and there's this little meme that's on Twitter that I saw somewhere

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
that says, you know, Xbox One announces that used games

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
or new games are tied to one account, internet gets crazy,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Steam games are tied to one account,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
everybody loves Valveheart, you know, type of thing.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
And, you know, although I get the point there,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I'm thinking back myself personally,

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
I have never bought a game on Steam for $60

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
that was digital distribution only.

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
I have bought PC games where I had the little disk in my hand for $60,

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
you know, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, you know, whatever.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
You know, I've bought PC games that way,

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
but I've never done digital distribution on a game that wasn't on a cheap sale.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
And I've talked about this on an older OLR.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
I said there's gonna be, if, and again, this is all probably hysteria anyway,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
we don't really fucking know what's happening,

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
but there's gotta be some give here.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
If you're gonna tell people that their games are going to lose equity

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
and you're not gonna have that same resale value,

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
then you need to make the price of a new game cheaper.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Something's gotta give.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
That's why people love Steam,

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
because Steam makes games a heck of a lot cheaper.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Exactly, like I bought, was it?

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
I just bought a Sonic bundle with, you know, like 12 games in it for $20.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
It's just, it's that cheap impulse buy.

43:06.000 --> 43:12.000
You don't see Microsoft and Sony marking down their games by like 60% or something.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
It's just not gonna happen.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
So what makes you think it's gonna all of a sudden start happening

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
when they lock everything?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
You know, let's say we live in this perfect world now

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
where we have the bandwidth to download these games digitally

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
and they decide, hey, you know what?

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
We're gonna go, we're gonna do everything digital.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Do you really think they're gonna have the same type of sales as Steam does?

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
No, of course not.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
It's just like how on the PlayStation Network,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
how you can get like PlayStation portable games

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
that are more expensive on, you know, the digital store than they are at retail.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Osfernchat says, I like the point someone made earlier

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
that while we should be used to tied accounts on PC,

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
that was something we didn't have to deal with for consoles and it was nice.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
Captain Spike says, not to prove EA right about Steam devaluing games,

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
but aside the very rare new release once or twice a year,

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
I don't buy anything on Steam that's more than like 20 bucks.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
But do you hear those companies complaining?

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
Those companies have already made back their money a lot of times on these games

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
and now they're just dropping prices.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
It's extra sales for them.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I mean, they're not printing discs.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
It's just digital copy.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
It costs nothing for them to manufacture that.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
I want to get to one more comment from Major Nelson's blog.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
He did a chat with Yahoo, which, God,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Yahoo is like everywhere in the news all of a sudden

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
with the whole Tumblr and everything else they've been buying.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
But anyway, Major Nelson was on Yahoo

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
and the very first question thrown at him in the Yahoo chat is about used games.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
Larry, could you please provide some more clarity

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
as to how users will be able to play used games on Xbox One?

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Here's the response.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
We are still months away from the launch of Xbox One

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
and policy decisions are still being finalized.

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
So, that being said, do we need to just sit down

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
and fucking wait for E3 for more information to come out on this?

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
Is the internet going too crazy with this shit?

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
No, I think that they're going the adequate amount of crazy.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
In fact, crazier would be better because you know why?

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
It sends a message to them that, listen, people are concerned about this

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
and this will actually affect their decision to purchase your console.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
If people just sat back and like, eh, whatever, it's not a big deal,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
then they're going to keep up with it.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
That's why all this stuff needs to be.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
They need to be hounded.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
Every goddamn press conference or every time that you see these guys

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
that you have an interview with them or whatever,

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
you need to bring this shit up so that it's fresh in their mind

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
that people are still concerned about it.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
That is the thing.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
We need to keep doing that because otherwise they're just going to assume

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
that we don't care and they're going to do whatever they want.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
Well, you reminded me of one big thing they talked about at the press conference

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
that we didn't talk about earlier, and that's the Azure Cloud,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
or Blue Cloud, Windows Blue, haha.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
So they have the cloud, right?

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
And they're talking about that they can do processing on the cloud

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
and that's something you can do in games.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
What is this, something like 300,000 servers functioning, da-da-da?

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
And of course this makes people think in their mind, isn't this what SimCity?

46:02.000 --> 46:08.000
So Xbox One is going to have, you could put SimCity on Xbox One.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
I think they're just saying it's something that they can implement

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
that anybody can do that.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
They can have an online-only game.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
That's up to the decision to the developer and the publisher.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
So yeah, cool, they're offering this for developers to use if they need to.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I'm fine with that because you know what?

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
I'll figure out which games those are and I just won't play them

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
if that's an issue for me.

46:30.000 --> 46:35.000
So I just don't, I don't know.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
Would this be a deal breaker for you?

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Yes.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
If they implement this not to your satisfaction,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
are you writing off this console completely?

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
Even if it has Killer Instinct, Grand Theft Auto 6,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
the games that you really want to have?

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Yes.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
Because I don't want to mess with this bullshit.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I don't want to mess with this bullshit on PC.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
I'll build a new PC.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Or I will play the backlog of games I'm going to have.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Besides Grand Theft Auto 5, who knows?

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Whenever Grand Theft Auto 6 comes out four or five years from now,

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
I'm sure all this stuff will be ironed out already.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
All right, let's talk about one other thing that had the internet a bit in a tizzy,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
and that's the always online thing.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
Speaking of things that got the internet into a lot of rabble rabble talking,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
whatever, right?

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
That guy got fired.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Yeah, I love how all these rumors are like,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
there's no way, like I was even saying,

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
there's no fucking way that they'd pull this shit off because they can't

47:34.000 --> 47:39.000
because they're going to hurt themselves if Sony's not on board with this stuff.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
And in a nutshell, it appears,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
and I don't think we really have a clear answer,

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I don't think they've really clarified this,

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
I think this again came from one of them Kotaku interviews

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
that turned into a headline,

47:50.000 --> 47:57.000
but what I'm understanding is that you will not need to be constantly connected to the internet,

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
but approximately once every 24 hours your Xbox needs to touch base with home

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
to update the programming guide information and all that,

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
but it might need, again, we don't know, they haven't really said,

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
it might impact the game transaction,

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
especially if you are having to lock and unlock codes and so forth,

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
that may be a part of this too,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
where you need to be connected once every 24 hours,

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
or your one may not let you do what you want to do.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
See, that's what I was thinking,

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
well, that's what I was hoping that they would do,

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
ideally is that you would have that one time use code,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
and if you use that, then yes,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
you have to authenticate with the server

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
so that you can run that game without a disk once you install it.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
You'd have to authenticate it for the installation,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
and it's tied to your account, so be it,

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
just like if you downloaded an Xbox Live Arcade game.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
But if you don't have that, or if you can't authenticate it,

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
you'd still be able to play the game as long as the disk is in the drive.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
That was my hope, because that makes sense to me,

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
it's simple, easy, we can do that.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
But they're not going to have it that way,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
no, they want, once again, they're treating you like a pirate,

49:02.000 --> 49:07.000
they want to make sure that that shit is not somehow pirated onto your system,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and they're going to check it once every 24 hours.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
And I don't buy it to update their fucking channel guide,

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
because you know what, I'm not going to be using it for TV,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
because as of right now, I can't.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I don't have a cable box, I have a TV,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
the coax cable goes inside,

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
and I use my tuner to use the open QAM channels.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
So I can't, I can't do that.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Oh, but you can actually,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
you just have to buy a separate piece of hardware,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
so fuck them for that.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
Well, I mean, I'm going to cut a little slack here,

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
because it's not like we didn't change at some point

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
from the coaxial plugin to the RCA switches,

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
because Atari 2600, you had to have coaxial,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
then you get into Nintendo NES,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
you can do that with an RF switch,

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
or you can do the red-yellow plugs, red-yellow-white plugs,

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
and then that turns into composite years later,

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
now we're at HDMI.

50:00.000 --> 50:05.000
I can't exactly fault the logical steps we're taking in,

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
you know, input clarity.

50:07.000 --> 50:12.000
I don't have anything to output HDMI into my console,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
that's what I'm saying.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
And yes, I do think it's a fucking ridiculous thing

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
that they have where the console does not have component support.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
The PlayStation 4 does,

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
so I don't know why they can't do it here.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
Vogkauf in our chat room, turn your head and Vogkauf,

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
says, Sky, what's the difference between Xbox One's

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
every 24-hour authentication and Steam's authentication?

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
Fair question, but I guess one thing I think of, too,

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
is that, okay, well, in order to use Steam in the first place,

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
you had to be on the internet.

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
So, logically, you have an internet connection because you got Steam,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
whereas I don't necessarily need to be on the internet

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
to pick up an Xbox One game.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
I can walk into a GameStop and get that.

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
And, you know, again, the thing people most commonly cite,

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
military bases don't always have an internet connection.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
A lot of them do, though.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
But one of my friends is on the military

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
and he doesn't post on Facebook all day long.

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
But, you know, granted, others don't necessarily have that connection.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
But they can still get the PC games mailed to them and so forth,

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
but that wasn't through Steam.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
So, I mean, that's, I guess, the key difference,

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
is that in order to get that Steam game in the first place,

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
you had to be on the internet.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
So, clearly, you have an internet connection.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
Whereas with Xbox One, if that's the only way to do it, to play the game,

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
it is a little bit different than necessarily PC gaming.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
I honestly, I don't know,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
I haven't really had a problem with internet.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
I've been places without internet at, you know, my work or whatever,

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
and still play my Steam games just fine.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
But, you know, I do connect.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
I have internet at home and stuff.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
So, I haven't really been without internet for a long span of time,

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
but I don't really know how Steam treats that.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
So, I can't really say.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
I do know that they have an offline mode.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Now, I'm not really sure how that works either, but...

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Yeah, some people in chat are talking about offline mode right now.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
So...

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
And it works fine.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I don't know. I would trust...

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
It just doesn't seem that bad on Steam,

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
but then again, everything's digital on Steam.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Everything is digital,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
and yes, I understand that they're using the excuse that,

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
okay, you're just digitally downloading off a disk.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
However you want to fucking word that.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
You know, that's ridiculous.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I just don't know.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
I just don't like the fact that

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
game companies still treat everybody as a licensed user

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
instead of you own this like I own a car.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
I'm not a licensed user of a car.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Well, but judging from the internet reaction,

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
some people are basing their decision on this console on that.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
You know what I mean?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Like, if this used thing pans out to be true,

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
I don't...

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
There's a lot of people on the internet that are...

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Well, right now, like I said...

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
And you might say,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
angry fanboys, da-da-da-da-da,

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
but, you know, every one of those comments is coming from a potential buyer.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I haven't made any firm decisions about any console yet,

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
so, you know, whatever.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
And I don't think anybody should until at least E3,

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
because to be fair, again,

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
we don't know the answers to this, necessarily.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
We're having to read between the lines on a lot of this.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
And on top of that...

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Microsoft needs to make it crystal clear.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
And on top of that...

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
So does Sony.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
We need to see what games are coming,

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
because...

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
I don't know.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Forza 5 is kind of cool,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
but do I need a console for that?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Nope.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
I mean...

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
The one that's going to be tough?

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Killer Instinct.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
I'm going to be...

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
And we hear rumblings that,

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
yes, Rare is reviving a historic IP from Rare,

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
and granted, that could be one of a couple other games, too,

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
like Conker or something,

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
but, you know, a lot of people,

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
based on earlier leaks,

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
they're like,

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
it's going to be Killer Instinct.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
That's going to be fucking rad.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
They got that trademark.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
You know, it makes a lot of sense.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
That's going to be a hard one to say no to, right?

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
Yeah.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Well, actually, no.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
Not for me,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
because I never was a fan of Killer Instinct.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Oh, get out.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
All right.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
Although Crackdown, Crackdown 3,

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
which there is a rumor that it's going to be one of the games

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
because they had the little orb icon on their dashboard

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
during their presentation.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Ooh.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
That might...

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
I may have to get in on that.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
All right.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
One other thing I want to mention about the hardware

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
and the Always Online in this is the whole Kinect.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
So the Kinect, apparently, has to be plugged in.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
You have to have that.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Again, I don't know if this is coming directly from Microsoft

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
or where this came from.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
Do you know where we ended up at this conclusion,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
that the Kinect always has to be plugged in?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I think it was one of the after-interview things.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I understand why it has to be,

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
because once again, it's just games being installed on the hard drive.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
They have to assume that you have it so they can use it.

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
They can't just program it so that you don't have it.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Although, I mean,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
it would be nice to assume that you have it,

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
and then if the game doesn't use it, maybe just not...

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Well, no, actually,

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
because you're still going to have to use it in your face.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
It'd be cool if you turned that off,

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
and if a game needs it,

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
it would be like a controller's unplugged or something.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Here's the thing.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
And this is causing a lot of people...

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
Like, somebody on Twitter was saying that they had heard Glenn Beck,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
which I'm so sorry that you had to hear that,

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
but maybe it was people that were listening to Glenn Beck or whatever

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
that apparently they were talking about this on a show the other day

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
about the conspiracy theories

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
about how the Kinect is how the government is going to spy on us in our homes,

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
and all this.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
I think, you know, and...

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Which was totally the plot of an episode of Scandal.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
I'm sorry, but this is going to, once again, out me

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
that I still read Kotaku occasionally.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
Sorry, it's a hard habit to break, but...

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
You like trash, just admit it.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
I have...

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Listen, I fully understand...

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Sometimes you find...

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
No, it's not that I'm...

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Cans in the garbage, you can go recycle.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I'm entertained by what they're posting,

56:02.000 --> 56:07.000
because honestly, I hold Polygon to the same level of garbage

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
in their postings, so...

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
I like to have the full picture, and I read everything.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
And even if that means reading the same story like five times.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
But they actually, one of their posts on there were

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
they were trying to get people to send messages to Fox News

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
because they wanted to run the whole campaign of

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
the Xbox One doesn't let our troops play games.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Oh, fuck that!

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Because, you know, you...

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
Okay, so when Fox News decides to go on something,

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
some crazy-ass tangent that Mass Effect has crazy lesbian sex

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
and is corrupting our kids or whatever,

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
you know, you want to tear them down, but then,

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
oh, now it's suddenly convenient, we might need them to be a mouthpiece

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
to, you know, get on the gaming companies, like...

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Go...

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
Get a new hobby, for fuck's sake.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
And there's some questions in chat.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Polygon is garbage? Yes. I'm sorry.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I don't agree, by the way.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
That's Loki's opinion, not mine.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
That's my opinion. I'm sorry, let me change that review

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
five more times.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
Actually, it isn't trash anymore. I think it's great.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
Oh, nope, trash again. Nope, it's great.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Anyway, that's not what this episode's about.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Alright, here's what I wanted to say about the Always On Connect.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
So, my assumption is, one of the reasons it needs to do that

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
is because, you know, to walk into your house and say like,

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Xbox, turn on, and all this.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
But now after what you said about the hole at once

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
to see how many people are in the room to watch a movie,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
like, I kinda can't help but go, God, that's weird.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
But... How are you gonna stop that?

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Blocking it? They're gonna say something's blocking...

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
Why not? Why can't I just turn my connect around,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
face the wall, and cover the mic?

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Because they'll be like, where are you?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Then if the system does...

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
I'm gonna be honest. I am gonna be perfectly honest.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
If that's how the system's gonna work,

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
that almost concerns me more than the used game hubble-oo thing.

57:56.000 --> 58:01.000
Like, sometimes, guys, I like to, when I get home,

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
take off my pants, then sit down on the couch and play some video games.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
And I don't necessarily need a camera on me,

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
showing what I look like down there in the corner or whatever,

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
when I'm doing that.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
What if you get a quick Skype call?

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
What if I accidentally leave Skype open or, you know,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
heaven forbid, the voice command, you know,

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
Xbox, broadcast live on Twitch?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I don't know what happens, you know?

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
I don't really want that.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
That's stupid, bitch. Launching Twitch.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
Yes, something like that. Exactly, right?

58:32.000 --> 58:38.000
Now, I realize they're talking about these privacy settings and so forth,

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
but again, you're asking me to just fucking trust you.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
One cool thing we forgot to mention is they're gonna have the same,

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
not really sharing feature, but it's gonna record your gameplay

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
and you can edit it with an editor and stuff.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
That's kinda cool.

58:53.000 --> 58:58.000
Yeah, but I just, you know, again, I don't need Connect to always be watching.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
I just don't like that, yeah, it's always on stuff.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
And here's the other thing, too, is it doesn't really serve me that well,

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
because I take my console, although, here's the thing,

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
I can't do that anymore, actually, now that I think of it,

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
because I take my console, well, I'd have to get another cable.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
Set up again. I take my console and my game on a monitor that has DVI in.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
I guess I have my DVI cables now, but whatever.

59:22.000 --> 59:27.000
If I didn't have those cables, it only has DVI in or VGA in.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
I can't do that because, see, I have all these wonderful cables for my Xbox 360.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
I have a VGA cable that made it, it was fantastic.

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
But now that I got rid of that multi-AV port, I'm stuck with fucking HDMI.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
Yes, I know, I could buy a brand new monitor that has HDMI in,

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
but why am I going to fucking spend more money to play a game system that I've got to buy also?

59:47.000 --> 59:52.000
That's also going to have more expensive games. Why do I want to do that?

59:52.000 --> 59:57.000
VogCoff in our chat room brings up another story that kind of ties into the whole Kinect thing.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Rob, all the voice commands being demoed on the Xbox One affected all Kinect users on 360,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
stopping streams and such. I'm sure you've read about that,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
where people that were watching the streams on the 360, the voice commands were fucking with the plug-in.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It's even worse than that, like actual stuff on TV.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Like, they were showing someone watching an episode of The Cleveland Show,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and it was saying something about their, like, stop.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
You know, I'm going to stop that, and it kept stopping his stream when he was playing it,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
and the only way he could do it was mute it to get past it.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
So, like, if my Kinect is plugged in, think about it.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Somebody on live television could get up there and just yell into the microphone,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
That's the old Kinect. The old Kinect doesn't determine, it only listens to sound.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
The new Kinect is actually going to see you, and it's going to know which person is saying that, allegedly.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Unless, of course, you could mime it, and then someone else yells it out.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
In which case, it probably wouldn't know.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
But, I don't know. They're going to have a way around that.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
It's more sophisticated now.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Alright, I think that covers most of the bases.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
There's a few other stories that came out after the Xbox One.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Some things on a positive note, certainly, is that they're talking about a 1 versus 100 style game for Xbox One.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Not at launch, but certainly within the opportunity for the future.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And that doesn't necessarily mean it will be 1 versus 100.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
But you know I never shut up about how great that was, and that it died way too soon on 360.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
So I'm really excited that they are talking about bringing back that type of idea on Xbox One.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
That would certainly make the system a lot more attractive.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Some YouTubes out there that are skewering the press conference a little bit,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000
one of them just repeats TV, TV, TV, Call of Duty, Call of Duty, Call of Duty, and sports, sports, sports, over and over again.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I don't think that those videos are as hilarious as the PlayStation 3 press conference a few years ago.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
No, they had the same guy did it, and his was kind of funny.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
But at the same time, you know, I didn't hate the press conference.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
The press conference they had was exactly the type of stuff I expected.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
It's everything that came out after the fact on the internet that's causing the concern.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
The press conference itself was fine.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I had no problem with the press conference.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Yeah, it was literally all the information.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
After the press conference I was like, I guess I'm going to have to get an Xbox One.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And then after the press conference I was like, not with this information though.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Alright, any other news type things that we need to bring up that you think we might have missed somewhere along the line?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000
PlayStation 4 is teasing the reveal of their console.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Yeah, I saw it the day before. It was funny.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Yeah, so.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
We're going to open up the Skype line in a moment if you guys want to call in.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Again, that is if you are here with us live on Thursday night, May 23rd, 2013.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
If you're hearing the rebroadcast on Sunday, we're actually not here.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
We took Memorial Day weekend off, but we'll rebroadcast this on Sunday night.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
We are going to open that up in just a moment, and we'll talk about some of the other news this week during that time.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But before I go to the phones and ask people where their head is at on the 360, or, whoops, Xbox One.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
It's going to take me some time to get used to that.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I want to kind of ask you, Loki, where are you at right now with Xbox One?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I just need to figure out what they're doing.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Because they're going back and forth, and I don't even know how the used game thing works and what the online only stuff is.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And that's all software anyways, so that can be changed in a drop of a hat.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So, until it comes out, we don't know.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I just hope that they kind of figure out, hey, maybe that's not a good idea to do that right now.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
You know, maybe wait until next generation.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Or, you know, I don't know.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
It's just like, you know, EA.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:48.000
They had news this week that, oh, it's like, we're actually developing some games for the Wii U, just not as many.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I mean, so, what's to say to EA?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I mean, it wouldn't be very popular, but what's to say EA couldn't say, haha, just kidding, we're going to have online passes anyways.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
We changed our minds.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
They're called, like, freedom passes now.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I'm in a similar boat where it's like, you know what, it's just too soon to make a determination on Xbox One.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
There are some things I like that I'm hearing, and there are some things I don't like that I'm hearing.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And although I'm interested in Quantum Break, that's not enough for me right now.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I'm very curious to see what E3 brings when they unveil these other titles.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I bet there's going to be something in there, especially if Killer Instinct is one of the games, that's something that's going to give me great pause.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000
But, if they screw up this use thing or the connect thing, that could be a deal breaker for me.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
But I'm not going to sit here and say, oh, I'm not buying, I'm definitely not buying one now.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Because my opinion can damn well flip flop one way or the other on E3.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
It's just like people going, well, I'm definitely buying a PlayStation 4 now, I'm not buying an Xbox One.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I'm like, you don't even know what the hell they're doing.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I think Sony's got a lot to say, too.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And I know we haven't been talking about them tonight, because the focus hasn't been on them this week.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
But there's still a lot of questions they've got to answer, too.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Like, we don't know what they're using, you know.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I think they've said that they support used games, but once again, they say they're supporting used games here, too.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Yeah, exactly. Microsoft's able to say the same thing, so I kind of need that to be crystal clear.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
So, we'll find out more.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And again, at least I know how my Wii U works.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
At least you'll get some games this year for it.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
You know, I got to go here with you, though, Loki, because you're one of Nintendo's biggest critics.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:39.000
But I was having some Twitter conversations earlier this week, and talking about Xbox One and all the tin-hat foil theories.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Do you see a path here where Nintendo could, and I don't want to sound fanboy here,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.000
but do you see a path here where Nintendo could walk away with this holiday season?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
No.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
You know why? Why? Because the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are still out there.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And I'm sorry, even if the Wii U does okay, you've still got all the really big games coming out on the current-gen consoles.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And hell, we can consider the Wii U a current-gen console, too, because it's pretty much the same as far as graphics go.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
In fact, actually, it won't have Battlefield 4, so there's one strike against it.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I mean, you may not care for some people in any Zelda game. Who cares? Mario Kart, who cares?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
But I don't think it's gonna...

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I kind of care about Mario Kart. I think a lot of people do.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
No, no, I'm saying who cares, because you have Mario Kart. That's what I'm saying.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I don't know. I don't buy all the systems from Mario Kart anyway, so who knows? Maybe we'll get a Wii U this fall.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Right? That's gonna be the hilarious thing that happens. I'm gonna laugh so fucking hard if that happens.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
If Loki ends up walking out with a Wii U this holiday season.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
No, I'm not. I'm not dumb enough.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Say that now.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
No, I am saying that now, because Mario Kart 7 is kind of lame.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:01.000
So I'm not gonna buy a system for one game, unless they have Excite Truck 2, in which case I will be buying that game.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Mario Kart, no, I'm sorry. It's not gonna be a big... Excite Truck, and if it's awesome, movie.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Black Wolf and chat bringing up a little thing that we missed. You can have more than 100 friends on Xbox One.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
That's a thousand friends.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.000
A thousand friends. That's great, but I have to express a little bit of disappointment. Why didn't they just roll that out on 360?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Wait a second. Actually, won't it have to be on 360? Because your live account's gonna be tied to the Xbox One.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
So, how's that gonna work?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
How's that gonna work?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
If I get my friends list up to 150 on the Xbox One, what happens when I go back to my 360?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
They're gonna have to fix it.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Ah, fuck you! Ah, we saw right through it. You're just trying to get us to buy another console.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Case closed.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Yeah, I guess there's gonna have to be a...

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
They're gonna need that extra cloud competing, you know, to figure out where your other friends are, I guess.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I don't know, or maybe only the first hundred will show up. Oh god, that would be so...

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to give her... Only these hundred people get a rose. Everyone else will have to go home.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
You're gonna have to go home and live on the Xbox One until I come back and visit you.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Alright, we're getting close to the end here of our little chat, but I do want to open it up, the Skype line, and see what you guys have to say.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
So, if you are listening to us live on this Thursday night, May 23rd, go ahead and give us a call.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
1-877-GAMELR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
We want to know your thoughts on Xbox One.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Some of the other news to come out from the world of gaming. Since there is no show this Sunday, I want to just throw some of these other things out here real quick.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Release date today for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn, August 27th.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Yeah, it was August. I was guessing a week earlier. I was wrong.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Oh, you were wrong. August 27th, collector edition pre-orders are already available.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Looks like it's... I'm excited about XIV Realm Reborn.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I'd be more excited if it was, you know, a pay-to-play and that was it. No monthly fee.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I would definitely buy it. I'm not going to buy it.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Who knows? Who knows? One of the last holdouts is going free-to-play in June. Rift is finally going free-to-play.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Come on, Final Fantasy XI. What the hell?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Yeah, I seriously can't think of any games that charge a monthly fee at this point besides WoW and Final Fantasy XI and XIV. Or, in the future, XIV. But anyway.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Let's see. Over on Nintendo's side, a 3D version of Altered Beast coming to the 3DS eShop in Japan.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Neat.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Did you see Mario and Wario's Crowd Farter, the little parody of Kickstarter?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000
That was some great shade. I'm sorry. I was really a fan of that, what they did there.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
The whole, like, if you share on Facebook and Twitter and it gets to certain levels, they'll unlock.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And, granted, a lot of the stuff they're talking about unlocking is kind of dumb. Like, you know, backgrounds and new trailers and things like that, which is a little silly.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.000
But I just, I really love some of the parody they did of Kickstarters with their little Crowd Farter. That was pretty funny.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Again, 1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to talk to us about the Xbox One.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
EA may have backtracked a little bit on their earlier statements about the Wii U.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Yeah, that's so sweet.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
This was coming from a comment from... trying to bring it up here.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:25.000
This was from Jeff Brown, who is an EA spokesperson. Oh, sorry, that was the person who originally said no games in development for the Wii U currently.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen, quote, you know, I will ultimately let consumers vote on PlayStation versus Xbox.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.000
You know, I think Nintendo's business was more of an extension of their last console. We are building titles for the Nintendo consoles.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
But not anywhere near as many as we are for PlayStation or Xbox.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And not in 2013.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Interesting. So I wonder what it is they're doing.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000
There's no, they haven't announced anything. There's nothing coming, unless they do maybe a port of Need for Speed when that comes out.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Or maybe a port of whatever Star Wars project's coming up. Because, you know, if the Wii U is the, and I'm using my little quotey fingers, kiddie console, then, you know, maybe a Star Wars thing on the Wii U would make a lot of sense.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
They could do a Lego Star Wars game on the other one, you know, or something like that.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I think, well, I can guarantee that they don't have, well, they don't have NCAA, they don't have FIFA, they don't have Madden, they don't have NBA Live as a Wii U title, and definitely not Battlefield.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:33.000
So, so far, I don't think there's anything left this year that EA's putting out that has a Wii U title to it. They have nothing coming.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:44.000
So, if it's anything, it's gonna be, you know, 2014, and maybe the next round of sports games, maybe they're gonna, maybe, I think they're gonna take a wait and see approach and see how, you know, the sales go of the console.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:55.000
If it picks up in the fall, then it'll warrant them making a Wii U version. It's always what it's been. It's not been, I don't think, a personal vendetta against them or something because of any sort of draconian DRM thing.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Or tinfoil hat that they've made a pact with Microsoft.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:12.000
It makes sense because everybody's doing it. It's not just EA. Everybody's not making stuff for the Wii U because they're just not selling the main consoles. It costs a lot of money to port your game over, and if you're only gonna sell, like, 100,000 copies, then it's not worth it.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:20.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, dress.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Square Enix apparently gonna be doing some E3 video shows.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Shocking! It's a video!

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Well, at least they're not making everybody go and get tickets to go in the theater to just sit there and watch a bunch of trailers. At least they're not doing that, to be fair.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
They should. They should make you get tickets and wait on line.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You think? That would be kind of funny. Let's go to the phones. Finally, it's lighting up. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Hey, it's Sterlok.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Hey, Sterlok. What's up, buddy?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Not too much. Just wanted to talk about the Xbox One a little bit here.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Yeah, you had a very interesting Twitter rant earlier this week that a lot of people might not be thinking of. I don't know if you were gonna tap into that or...

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Yeah, definitely. That's definitely part of it. So, yeah, well, we don't know if this is... Do we know if this is actually true or not, the whole code thing?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:24.000
We don't. They are not gonna say one way or the other until E3. There's a lot of very vague... There's a lot of vague vagueness right now, so we just don't know. We have nothing but internet wank to go off of and conspiracy tinfoil hat theories.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Yeah, that's what I figured. But if they do go that route and you have to enter a code, say, on the box, like the online passes worked, that essentially means that if I want to play a new game on the Xbox One, I'm gonna have to get someone cited to enter the code for me.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And sometimes it might be a little while before someone's got the time that can do that. Like with the 360 and every other console, I can't just buy a game and pop it in the system.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
We don't know if it's gonna work that way.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:22.000
As a blind gamer, do you run into accessibility issues on any current-gen consoles when it comes to being able to just kinda pop in and play a new game? Do you ever have to get assistance there?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It's mostly just memorizing how the layout of the menus and stuff work. I had to kind of... And I'm gonna have to do it again probably when they update the 360's dashboard.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:49.000
But it's mostly just memorizing the dashboard just to know how the hell to get to the XBLA games. That's really all it is. It's not that big of a deal.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Well, hopefully they will do some type of accessibility. I mean, I can understand why they can't spend a lot of time at their 60-minute little unveiling to talk about accessibility. But it would be nice to hear a little bit about that.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:21.000
And they could do it. What a lot of people are pushing for now, and I think this argument has a little more traction now with this whole all-in-one entertainment center thing that they're trying to do.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:41.000
There really should be some sort of accessibility thing built in. Because Windows 8 now has... They redid their narrator screen reader, which they've kinda always had, but it's always been sort of a joke.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:16:04.000
But they redid it for Windows 8, and it's actually not that bad. So they could probably, if they really wanted to, do... But I think, honestly, we're just such a small market, really, that it doesn't really matter to do them. It's not really cost-effective for them to do that.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Yeah, but that's such a... I don't know, that perspective would just be so harsh. It's not cool, you know? It makes me not want to like them.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:23.000
But it's just the way it is. But with the voice commands, that does alleviate some of it. With the Kinect voice commands.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I guess that's... Okay, so I guess there's a positive in there, is that, yeah, if you can kinda drive the entire console with your voice, you may not need to memorize the menus, right?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Yeah, exactly. I could just say, hey, play... I don't know, well, I can't say another XBLA game. I wanna play Guardian Heroes or something.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.000
But it kinda sucks that not even XBLA games are backwards compatible. That's kind of a big downer.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Yeah, it is, but, you know, the old...

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:00.000
360, I can understand. That makes sense, because it's a complete... But, I don't know, XBLA games, you'd think they could figure something out.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:09.000
It's the chipset. I mean, it sucks, but I'm hoping that it has long-term payoff with better games.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000
But, yeah, it would sure add a lot of better value if we could have the backwards compatibility, that's for sure.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Also, I wanted to bring up, I don't know if it's in the show role, but this Rare announcement.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Mm-hmm. Go ahead.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
What do you guys think it's gonna be?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:35.000
We touched on it earlier, and I'm pretty solid on Killer Instinct, just based on the earlier leaks, and that Microsoft rumors tend to be true.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I mean, hell, most of the rumors about this thing ended up being true, right? Pretty much.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Killer Instinct is pretty much the one thing that will guarantee me, no matter what they do with the Xbox One, that will guarantee me a purchase.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
It's all about the games, isn't it?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Killer Instinct, man, anything with Killer Instinct on it, I will buy.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.000
You'll sell these morals about codes and things like that for some more Killer Instinct.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Yes.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
There's a lot of gamers that are like that.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
It's one of the best fighting games ever fucking made.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Yeah, I know. Tell Loki about it.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
As long as they get the original announcer back.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Mm-hmm.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
They gotta get that original announcer with the c-c-c-c-cabo breaker.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Alright, uh, uh, Sturlock, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but any other, uh, last thoughts for our listeners?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Um, uh, E3 is gonna be really interesting this year.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
To say the least. Alright, buddy, you take care.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Alright, you too.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Alright, bye.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Uh, now our phone's ringing a little bit more. Let's go to another call. We already have another call coming in.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Hi, Aaron Orange on the radio, who's this?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Hello, it's Shane.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Hey, Shane, how you doing?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I am fine.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Happy birthday!

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Thank you.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
You're listening to this little show on your birthday?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
It's, like, almost midnight here, so the day's, like, pretty much over.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Oh, okay. Your 30th birthday, nonetheless.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
My fifth, 25th birthday, thank you very much.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Oh, okay, Bobby Blackwolf. Alright, uh, what's on your mind? What'd you want to say tonight?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I am so excited for Final Fantasy XIV after today.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
What do you want to say? Wait a minute, you didn't call in to talk about Xbox One?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Oh, who cares about that stupid system?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I, for my job, which I'm sure I've talked about what my job is, but I don't need to say it now,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000
but I was talking with, uh, retail people about it, um, on Wednesday.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Like, people that work at, like, maybe Target and Walmart and GameStop and all that.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Nobody had something positive to say about it. Everybody was hating on it.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Every single person I talked to.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Were they hating on the press conference or were they hating on the internet hysteria that happened afterwards?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
They were hating on the details that were being said.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Nothing about what a waste of, you know, an hour that was or, um, man, everybody's up in arms on the internet.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.000
They were like, this is the stuff that I read about that came out of that conference.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
This is what I saw at the conference. I don't care about anything they said.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I was like, yeah, okay, that makes sense. Same boat as most everybody.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Uh, where, where's your head out with Xbox One right now? Is it something you think you would pick up or?

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Killer Instinct can't make me pick that up. And that says a lot.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Because I love Killer Instinct.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Can't E3 still change your mind? I mean, what if it does turn out this situation with the used games and the Kinect is not as bad as we're all making it out to be?

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And E3 shows us everything's just fine. Would that change your mind?

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:50.000
No, because before going into the press event, like, Microsoft doesn't have anything exclusive that I care enough about

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000
that would make me want to shell out the money for a brand new VCR.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Like, I, with the other two companies, they have exclusives I care about.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Microsoft had Alan Wake, which they don't really do anything with anymore.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And Dance Central, which I'll get by. I'll get by not having Dance Central.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Who knows if it'll stay Kinect or Microsoft only or if it will go to, like, Sony's new camera-y thing. Who knows?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:36.000
But those two wouldn't have been enough. And if somehow they let Rare do something cool and, like, make Killer Instinct, well, honestly, Killer Instinct 1 was fantastic and 2 was crap.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:48.000
So they don't really have a great history either with that franchise. It's like the now-defunct Silicon Knights. They make one good game and everything else they make is crap.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Sorry, I'm laughing at what Alan Alchemy says in our chatroom at live.hognetwork.com.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Mass Effect 4, Caden Academy, Xbox One exclusive. Would that change your mind?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Possibly.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
There we go.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Okay, if Mass Effect somehow became an exclusive there and didn't require Kinect stuff, then...

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
See? The right game will make you sell all your morals.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:26.000
But I don't think it would be possible for it to do that because EA wants money and they're not gonna put a game like Mass Effect on one system again. They did that for Mass Effect 1.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I've seen weirder things happen in gaming. Alright, I gotta wrap up soon so we can get more calls, but I do want you to have your say on Final Fantasy XIV. So what would you like to say about Rome Reborn?

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Everybody needs to watch the new trailer. It's beautiful and the box art for the collector's edition is super pretty and I am so pumped up for this game that I preordered it twice.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Why would you preorder it twice? I don't get it.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Because I want the collector's edition and I want a way to play it on PS3, but I did not want the PS3 collector's edition.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Alright. Anything else, Shane, before I let you go?

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Bobby, I can talk about whatever I want when I'm on the phone, so I don't want to talk about the Xbox one.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Don't use this as a platform to yell at chatters. Go into the chatroom and yell at them that way. Alright. Take care, Shane.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Oh, he hung up on me. I hope your birthday sucks once left of it. Six minutes.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Alright. I hope you get an earthquake in the next six minutes. No, I don't. I don't mean that.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange is Honest Radio. Who's this?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Hey, this. Hack Def.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Hey, Hack Def. What's on your mind?

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Well, talking about the Xbone or the XB1, whatever.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
The Xboner, yeah.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Well, one thing most people don't, well, I think they haven't talked or thought into consideration is the price.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Maybe, how about if the XB1 or even the PS4 are cheap enough to even, like, it doesn't matter the factor of all the crappy things they're announcing for it.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Maybe if the price is low, will people get it?

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Well, you know, these rumors keep going around, which, you know, Microsoft rumors tend to be true.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And which is funny because it came up on one of our list lists, you know, last year.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:43.000
The Xbox could go the subsidy route where maybe an Xbox One will only cost you $199.99.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:53.000
But with a two-year contract obligation to Xbox Gold or Xbox Network for Halo TV or whatever they decide to add in with it.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Well, yeah, it may work, but I really wonder if people will just go ahead and buy it, even or despite all the things, just because it's cheap.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.000
So, that's most of what I think right now.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Though, in general, I wouldn't get an Xbox One, at least not at launch, maybe.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Mostly because it doesn't have a component or an RCA port, so I don't have an HDTV.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Interesting.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And most people, I know, maybe do have an HDTV that handles HDMI.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000
But I don't know that many people.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I have a pretty early, I shouldn't say very early, I have a pretty early HDTV where mine only had component cables.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000
It did not have, it wasn't capable of doing 1080p either. It could do 1080i but not 1080p.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Oh, yeah. See, my other TV I have only has DVI and it can only do 1080i.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Yeah. So, yeah, you couldn't, I couldn't do, that's the TV that's in our bedroom. I couldn't do an HDMI.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:11.000
That reminds me, so, I know that it's going to support, you know, those resolutions and stuff, but is it going to get all fucked up when you try to hook up your system?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Is it going to try to do 1080p and it's like, oh, sorry, can't do 1080p on this TV, so fuck you.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Yeah, I don't know. Well, a lot of people have only 720 TVs though because of like 299 sales at Walmart and whatever.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I just, I don't know how it's going to work.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Maybe it will have native, native resolution. Don't know.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
What if there was a converter, you know, something you could do to convert the signal? Would that change your mind?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
You can. You can.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Oh, well, there it is. HDMI to DVI or even I think component.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I have one of those.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:27:01.000
But even then, it's like not having the greatest quality, so I wouldn't get that even though I could easily get a replacement for it.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I would rather have an HDTV. And right now, I know HDTVs are cheap in the United States, but get on my side of the border.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Those things are hell expensive.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.000
And that was a response to a comment from Rama in the chat who said HDTVs are cheap. Don't give me that shit.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.000
But yeah, you live in Mexico and, you know, there might be fees to import things and whatever.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Just, you know, sometimes, you know, it doesn't cost the same that it would here, so it makes sense.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000
You could, don't you sometimes travel to the States, though, to make big purchases? You could. You could, right?

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I could, yeah, but it's still something that is easy to do because the customs, if you have certain merchandise over a certain price, you have to, well, register.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Declare it and all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, okay, but so basically, your big holdup on Xbox One is that it's just going to be too big of a pain in the ass to actually play the thing.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.000
And I'm getting the sense there's really nothing yet. I mean, granted, we haven't had E3, but there's nothing yet that's really selling you on the system.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:18.000
But could it, I mean, if they come out at E3 and say killer instinct, are we going to be having a different conversation or is there a game that would make you go,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:27.000
alright, I'll get in the car and drive to get my HDTV. I mean, is there any game that would make you start putting that in motion?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:40.000
They already have it. It's Force of Five. I want Force of Five, but the console isn't, it isn't worth buying the console for just that game.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Maybe, yeah, if they announce more games at E3, they will, but if they announce games that interest me, like, yeah, Killer Instinct is going to be like, wow, I have to get the console.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:12.000
But many other games, too, that will at least warrant, well, not warrant, because, to justify the buying the console and getting all the trouble or passing all the trouble.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I gotta say, though, as much as Force of Five looks cool, I want a Force of Horizon 2.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Oh, yeah.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I don't even, don't hate me, but I don't even really like the Force of Games, but because Force of Horizon was more of like an arcade style, like, I loved it.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:37.000
You know what I want? I want, and just because we don't have it yet, how many consoles are launching right now, and no fucking Ridge Racer. Seriously. There is no Ridge Racer.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Good question.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
What the hell.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Wait for E3. Wait for E3.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I want Ridge Racer. I don't care. I liked Ridge Racer 6. Ridge Racer 6 is awesome.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I think Sony should make a nod to their little blunder from a few years ago, and I think they should get Kazurai up on stage to go.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
And, ladies and gentlemen, one more game, you guys. It's Ridge Racer!

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Even better.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I want him to come out, I want him to come out on a Power Wheels, like, Corvette or something like that, and he's all, Ridge Racer!

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
With the little bike helmet crashing off the stage, yes.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Yeah.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Alright.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
That would be cool.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Alright, Act Def, I gotta let you go. I'm gonna try to squeeze in one more call, but thanks for the call and the insight.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thanks for having me.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Alright, no problem. Take care, buddy.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000
We'll try to squeeze in one more call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Keep in mind, you can also always email your thoughts, mailbag at orangeslaunchradio.com.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I did see a couple emails in there already. I'll save those for Jamie in the next Sunday's show, just because we want to wrap, it's 10 o'clock on the West Coast, and I know it's like 1 a.m. for you guys on the East Coast.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.000
So we want to wrap up here pretty soon, so we'll do mailbag more on next week's show.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000
But I do want to see if we can get one more call in, so 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Before we get to whatever call comes in, any other news that came out this week we want to get to?

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.000
There's a new game from Techland that they announced that's a zombie free-running game.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:10.000
It looks like Mirror's Edge Crosswood Dead Island. Looks neat. It's 2014.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Also, I know that there was some Amazon overseas stuff that listed Mirror's Edge 2. I don't know if that's wishful thinking, or maybe they're going to announce a new Mirror's Edge game.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Sounds good to me either way.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000
That would be nice. I wonder if that's one of the 15 games. It might be.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Alright, we do have one more call coming in, so let's go to the phones and take it.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Hey, this is Zappi.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Hey, Zappi. How you doing?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I'm pretty good.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Long time, no talk. How you been?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Pretty good. Can't complain.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Good. Alright. So, Xbox One?

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Yeah, I've been checking out this Xbox One.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Yeah?

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
They're going to crash and burn. This feels like Windows 8 Take 2.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Why do you say that?

01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Well, first of all, they're blowing it off Windows. They were talking about the conference about using the Windows kernel, and they're putting that little snapping thing aside because what you want to be doing while you're playing a game is using the internet or whatever.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Sure, maybe for epic cues, but...

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:17.000
You know, I will say that is one thing we didn't see at the press conference that I did expect to see more of is that we didn't really see any type of like, you know, this is how it works with your PC.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:25.000
We did see the tablet thing, but they didn't say it was specific to Windows Phone or Windows tablet. You know, they implied it would work with iPads, but they don't want to say that.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:32.000
We didn't see as much of that as I thought we would. Not a single mention of Windows 8 that I recall.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
No.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Yeah, like they only said Windows kernel, which could mean anything. They could even have Metro apps. Who knows?

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:45.000
But what seemed like most interesting was the Skype looked exactly like it looked in Windows 8.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Yeah, well, you know, I understand though that they want to keep like a similar look and feel and what have you.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I thought that's why they have their kernel so they can run the Windows 8 apps. I mean, why else would you have three kernels on that goddamn thing?

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Yeah, no, they also have eight cores to be playing around with, so they gotta be doing something with it.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:10.000
You know, that makes me think that it would be so easy to make games for Xbox One because, you know, you can make the games in Windows or whatever.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.000
And then I go, oh yeah, one thing we didn't touch on earlier in the show, they're not going to let indies self-publish.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
It's the one platform where indies are not going to be able to self-publish.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I don't think they've said anything yet about that.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
But then they say they're going to have something worked out for indies at some point.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Yeah, okay, so they're backpedaling on somebody's way too soon comment. All right, fair enough.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:36.000
The one thing that scared me of the Skype thing is I get to the nice ending of Halo 5 and, oh, I got a Skype call completely ruining the ending for me.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Well, you would set your Skype to Do Not Disturb, right?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Hopefully, but half the time I probably wouldn't remember.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Also, that made me think that maybe the true next generation is the Steam Box.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Is that where you think you might go with gaming right now?

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Yeah, a nice little box that plugs into my TV, fully backwards compatible with all the games I bought before. It's starting to seem really appealing.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:12.000
But is there anything Microsoft could do to win you over? I've talked with a lot of the previous callers about that one game that's going to get you to just go back on everything you said.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Is there something out there that might do that for you?

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I don't think so. I've been thinking about it.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Sony has a lot more exclusives than I'd want to be playing that might maybe backfill, but Microsoft, Gears of War isn't exactly this killer game I need to play.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000
It's fun, but it's not the game I need, so I don't think there's anything Microsoft can do.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Well, and there's going to be some people that are like that. There's just like, you know what, there's really nothing, and I certainly know people like that, there's really nothing Microsoft has to offer that's going to convince me to get the console.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
What about other, are you currently a Wii U owner at all?

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Like I saw it at Costco for $200 for the core unit, and I still couldn't bring myself to buy it.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Wow.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Because there just is no games, and there's none coming on Horizon 1. Wind Waker, I played that for the billionth time.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Well, to be fair, wait for E3, you never know. I don't think you should buy a console in anticipation of games six months from now.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
But, you know, there might be something to make you go, okay, I got to start saving up for the holiday.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I don't know, Nintendo needs to be having their E3 conference so that doesn't give a lot of faith.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
What about PlayStation 4?

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:31.000
I'm mildly optimistic. It's so far what they've shown me, but it's good, but I haven't seen much of it because they just showed off a couple of early games.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Probably not in 2013 because Killzone isn't selling me on a console.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Alright, well, anything else you want to share with the listeners before I let you go or wrap up the show?

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
No, that's it.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Alright, well, good to hear from you. You take care.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Alright, you too.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Alright, later.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Later.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Alright, that's going to do it for our calls tonight. Thank you guys for calling in.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Sorry if you wanted to call in and you didn't get through, but remember you can always email your thoughts.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Any other things we want to touch on tonight, Loki?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Onomatoguchi's new album is awesome.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
That's what I hear. I can't wait to check it out.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000
If you go kickstart it, you might find that in their updates, they have the album for you.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
There you go. Awesome.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Alright, well, all the segments you know from the show will be back next week when we do the show again, which would be Sunday...

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I've got to look at the day here. I think it's the show before E3? No, it would be Sunday, June 2nd.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
First second.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
That will be our next show. Sunday, June 2nd will be our next show.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.000
That's not quite the pre-E3 show. That's going to be Sunday, June 9th, but certainly the news is going to start ramping up.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
We'll have a lot to talk about. All your favorite segments from the show will be back.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I can't wait for more next Xbox name rumors.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Really?

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
No, I'm just kidding. There's not going to be any because they were announcing it.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
There could be peripherals though.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
There should be some...

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000
It's going to be the Xbox 2.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Alright, well, before we close up shop tonight, do you have any final thoughts, Loki?

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Yeah, so VOG game night is going to be tomorrow night now, which will be Friday if you're listening to this on the podcast.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
So, you're too late.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Not necessarily. I'm going to put the podcast up tonight.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000
So, Friday. Friday around 8 to 8.30 because we usually let Josh see a little later on Friday.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Team Fortress 2.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
So, free. So, go check it out.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000
And... I don't know. I've never played it. So, we'll be interested.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I'm going to try to make it this time.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000
See, I don't know. I'm going to have to have someone hold my hand here as far as setting up games and stuff because I have no fucking clue.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Like I said, I've never, ever played the game.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Talk to ActAft. He's pretty seasoned in the game.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Maybe he can host or something. I don't know.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
So, we'll do that.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I was still thinking maybe I might move it to Friday nights going forward because I think it's easier for people to stay up later.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Especially on the East Coast because it's weekend.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Sure.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
And maybe not this week, but I have all the stuff to start recording.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
So, we'll be streaming that hopefully soon.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Actually, if you guys are doing Team Fortress 2, I should be able to stream that tomorrow.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
On the Orange Lounge Radio channel.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Yeah, it's PC. I can stream on PC. So, that'll be fun.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Yeah.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Alright, cool. Alright, well, I guess that's going to do it.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Thank you guys very much for supporting Independent Podcasting.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
I know this wasn't one of our regular shows.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
You know, Dark Sakura wasn't here for one and we didn't do our regular segments.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
But if you enjoyed our little banter and you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Because there's plenty more across 500 plus other episodes of the show and more to come.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000
You know, your word of mouth and helping to spread the word of the show is what keeps us afloat.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Because, you know, we don't have the resources to raise thousands and thousands of dollars to promote and buy ads and so forth.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So, thank you guys very much for supporting the show.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Leave us a nice word on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or whatever.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
And thanks for listening to us talk about Xbox One for a little while.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
We want to hear your voices too. Don't forget the mailbag, Twitter, Facebook and all that good stuff.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000
So, we'll see you back here on June 2nd, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern for another live show.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Have a great night everybody. See ya.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:26.000

See you next week.
