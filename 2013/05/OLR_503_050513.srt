00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, May 5th, 2013, one Wii U game finally goes free to play in the US.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Could more be coming?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Could creators of Nyan Cat Sue one video game maker?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And could Respawn's next game be an Xbox exclusive?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number 503 for May the 5th of 2013.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Happy Cinco de Mayo to you guys.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And on behalf of all Americans, I'd like to apologize to Mexico for Chevy's.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Because what is, seriously, what is Chevy's?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Delicious? They have like the salad that I freaking like.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And that corn stuff that I'm allergic to, I freaking love.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You bite your, you shut your whore mouth.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The voice of reason over there telling me to shut my whore mouth.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Rob's mouth is a dirty whore.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You know, people can take that a lot of different ways and I don't appreciate you slandering me on this program.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Your mouth is a freshly brushed whore.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What is that even supposed to mean?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It means it's clean. You brush your teeth.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, who I will not call names for one minute.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I think Reggie has sent you a secret Cinco de Mayo message because apparently your Wii is glowing.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, that Wii has been glowing for like two weeks.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, actually, not even that. About a week.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And honestly, my honest reaction when that thing started glowing blue,

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and I already know what the message is thanks to a news story coming up later,

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but when it started glowing blue, my honest reaction was it was plugged in.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I swear to God, I was like the Wii was plugged in.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I thought I unplugged it after I moved all the,

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
well, because there's literally nothing left on my Wii.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I did the little Pikmin transfer thing to my Wii U because I wanted the discount on the virtual console games.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So there's no reason for me to have the Wii except to use, what,

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
forecast channel and spin the globe and see what the weather's like in South Pole.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And then in June, they're pulling the plug on that.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So I won't even be able to see what the weather's like in the South Pole anymore

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
unless I actually pull up an internet web browser and look at weather.com or whatever.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What do you have that I have in my hand right now? You have an iPhone.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
A microphone.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
All you have to, bite me, all you have to do is just put in, like, Antarctica on your phone and, hold on.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Siri, you whore, what is, nothing, what is the temperature in Antarctica?

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm gonna see if Siri will answer. God, fucking Siri.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah, yeah, how great, yeah, how fucking wonderful.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh!

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can't find things in Antarctica. Can you be more specific?

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, you bitch.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, that awesome device you have in your hand. Yeah, technology, so great, innit?

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The joys of live radio.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, no one can see me flip off, Rob.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Also, say hello to our live audience and the ever-present fourth guest on our program,

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the chatters, live.vognetwork.com.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Once again, that's live.vognetwork.com.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Misty started us off tonight saying, fucking Siri indeed. See?

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There you go, all the VOG listeners hate Siri, confirm.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, I feel so bad for True, having your first card being 84 Mustang,

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
which is like one of the worst years for Mustangs.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Tiger Claw on chat says, did you see this week's SNL's weekend update

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
when they made fun of Google Glasses?

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, what do you think about that whole Google Glasses thing?

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I think it's too expensive.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, do we know the price on those yet?

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Aren't they like three grand?

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
$1,500.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, it was something, I knew it was at least over $1,000, so.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, and I think you have to be like cordially invited to test it out, too.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's like, if I had that kind of money, I'd just say, fuck it, Club 33.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, it's just because I didn't reply back to their tweets or whatever.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Are you supposed to say it on Google Plus? I'm not really sure how that works.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So they're like, I want to record everything I do.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, we'll give you one for free.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
VXJ6V in chat says, Rob Roberts, you skipped Loki? No, I didn't.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I said I would not make fun of him for a whole week.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Remember when I talked about the glowing light on the Wii? Where were you?

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, remember, Colorado did just recently legalize a little something something.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm kidding. I know Jason's not into that. Let's see.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What was the other comment? Oh, SH2100Matt says, Jamie just wishes Siri was more like Edie.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No, I do not.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
True. True facts. She might not be Joker.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I want the Seth Green voice for my phone because that would be real.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Actually, no, I want GLaDOS for my phone so that I can get directions while I'm being berated.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Can't you get like a GLaDOS GPS thing? I think I saw that somewhere.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You know what else they have? They have a SpongeBob one.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And I went to a pinball event and the guy had one.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And I was like, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
All right. Before we get into our gaming weeks, which we always start off the show with,

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I thought maybe we could start tonight by talking about the Ouya,

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
which is this ongoing saga of Loki's where you are one of the first few thousand people

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
that backed the Ouya, right?

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Number 1226.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Which, in the scope, how many people actually pre-ordered it?

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
63,000 something. Well, 63,000 people backed it.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Most of them backed it with getting a console.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Right.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, I'm sure it's a little less.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, you were still one of the first few.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, it was the first day.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So, you finally got your Ouya after waiting a couple weeks and what happened?

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It took like a month.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They sent me a ship. It was going to ship like back in April.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't remember. It was like the second week of April or something.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And it took like two weeks to get here.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But it's here.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's here now.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, you got it this week. You were putting some YouTubes up, right?

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, I was putting up YouTubes because there's not really a whole ton of information.

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What's your username on YouTube? LokiOLR.

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
LokiOLR.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, so I've got like four YouTube videos on there.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay, here's how I was shooting these videos.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We were still playing games over in our game room, which is basically an empty half of a building that we don't use anymore.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So, it's just me over there when I go to play games.

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And then, so I used two office chairs with that box and that Xbox 360 controller and leaned my phone against it.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And just to give you guys some perspective, this Ouya came in like literally a shoebox.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Like I would expect to see shoes in there.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah, it's a shoebox. Sort of, yeah.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And the Ouya itself is a tiny little thing.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They say it's about the size of a Rubik's Cube.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Dark Soccer was balancing it on her head earlier and I would say...

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm going to take a picture of it in comparison to the coffee cup.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah, it's about the size of the coffee cup. Actually, the coffee cup's bigger.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The coffee cup is bigger.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Which shows you...

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm going to put my iPad behind it.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Which shows you the priorities of our caffeine intake here at OLR.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So, Dark Soccer's going to take a picture for OrangeNoseRadio.com right now.

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Does that go to Tumblr too when you do that?

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It can.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So, yeah. So I got it and I did the firmware update that they had on there.

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And started downloading games.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then like one of the first few days I started trying to sideload stuff.

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Because I wanted to see what exactly you could sideload on it.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's weird because they don't really have a way to root it.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Although you're supposed to be able to root it straight out of the box and be able to do everything with it.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But it's still very early. I would still consider this like a beta test.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And for any outlet out there, especially Polygon or any of those guys to be reviewing this as an actual retail release.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's so fucking retarded. It's mind boggling.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So when you actually power this thing on for the first time, what happens? What does it look like?

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Is there a polished interface at all?

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, there's an interface. Basically, first you have to sync your controller.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So it says push the button on your controller until two lights show up.

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And you do that. It's really painless.

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And then once you've done that, you set up your wifi if you don't have it hooked up to the ethernet.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So you set up your wifi and then you either create an account or you log into an existing account with Ouya.

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If you need to have it or not.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So I had an account already so I logged into mine and that's it.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And then you're greeted. Well, I had to do a system update after that.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So you do a system update and then you go back to the main menu.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And then you have four menu options you get to choose from.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
They have one that's basically settings.

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
They call them all different things like manage or something.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They have a section that's make, which is basically all the side loaded stuff.

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Where if you're developing a game for Ouya, it's where you would dump your APKs and stuff.

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And where you'd be able to play that stuff.

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And then there's discover, which is their store.

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
They have that. And then play, which is going to be all your games.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So I went to the store and just downloaded everything.

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
As much as I could.

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And there was some stuff that I wanted to play since I'd seen video of it.

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
One of my first downloads was No Breaks of L.A.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Because I was like, this looked hilarious on the video when I saw it.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And yeah, it's pretty hilarious.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Is the Final Fantasy 3 on there yet?

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I have Final Fantasy 3, I have the demo for it.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I've been paying $15 for that.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And that's the thing too. I've downloaded everything I've downloaded so far.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I've not had to put any of my credit card information in yet.

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So you don't have to put it in until you want to actually buy something.

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think they changed that too in one of the very first.

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
They had the whole rabble rabble on the internet about that.

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it changed pretty quick.

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And you can go in and change that stuff.

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I think you can even remove it at any time or something.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So what about the hacking and all this?

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's supposed to be this whole open thing.

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Did you get in there and try to figure out?

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The first question I asked you was, did you get the emulators working?

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah, I have the emulators. I wasn't really...

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's emulators, so I haven't really bothered.

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I know what Mario Kart 64 looks like.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm not in a huge hurry to put that on there yet.

186
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Sometimes the emulators can be a little crappy.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I do want to play with it.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's like they have GSNES, which I recognize that as a PC thing.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And they have, I think, SNES 9X on there.

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't remember what the Nintendo 64 one was.

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And they just added one for the DS, which I don't know how the hell that would work.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But I guess it will.

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And what else?

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Some other cool things I found out about it.

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You can sync Xbox 360 controllers and PlayStation 3 controllers to it.

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh nice.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Although I have not gotten that to work correctly.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I noticed though, the Ouya controller, you were letting me kind of get a feel for it.

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's not that bad.

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's not bad. The only thing that bothers me a slight little bit is just the shoulder buttons.

201
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The shoulder buttons just kind of feel weird because they're big and fat.

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And so it's a little strange to me.

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But, you know, they work.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So, I don't know. It'll be alright.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But all the directional buttons...

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not even really a big deal about the letters being different on there.

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They're the same colors as the Xbox 360 stuff.

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So I just go by color anyway.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So I'm like, okay.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You pick it up in like a second and that's it.

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's not that jarring.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's like going between the PS3 and the 360.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's not that big a deal.

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But yeah, they have like one game.

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It supports up to like eight players with the 360 and the PS3 stuff.

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Although, see, the PS3 controllers do work.

217
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But I can't get both of them synced.

218
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because when I try to sync a PS3 controller to it, my Ouya controller becomes unsynced.

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And it's supposed to be able to just add it as a second controller.

221
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But I'm not doing something right.

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't really know what it is.

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's not a big deal.

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I mean, it's not something that's really officially supported anyway.

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But, you know, games...

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I've checked out some of the games on there.

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
They're pretty cool.

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I side-loaded Grand Theft Auto 3.

229
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Which is... it works.

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I haven't played 3 on my phone.

231
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So I don't know how...

232
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Actually, I did play 3 on my iPod one time.

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But then I was like, this is way too big.

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it doesn't work very well with the touch control, so I deleted it.

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I asked about Final Fantasy 3 specifically because I've played the DS version of that.

236
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I've emulated the NES one from way back in the day with the translation patch.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But more recently, I've played the iPhone, iPad version of it and the DS version.

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So I'm kind of curious how the Ouya one compares.

239
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sure it's probably the same.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Especially if it's Android.

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't remember if Square released that on Android, but I wouldn't be surprised.

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I think they have.

243
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So I checked out why I've downloaded that.

244
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I haven't gotten a chance to play it.

245
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I played a game called The Ball, which is alright.

246
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's kind of like a puzzle game.

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
A first-person puzzle game, similar to Portal or something like that.

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Except without the portals.

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I played a game called Phase, which is also a little similar to Portal.

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You change the phase of your shield or whatever and you can go in between certain force fields.

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And if you have it in the opposite phase, those force fields are solid.

252
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So you have to play with that mechanic and stuff.

253
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I played this Pingu poker game, which is something I'll probably be reviewing soon.

254
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's pretty fun.

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It kind of reminded me of a poker RPG game that was on the iOS platforms.

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't remember what that was called.

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Puzzle poker, or Swords and Poker, that's what it was.

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You used to love the hell out of that game on iOS.

259
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is not necessarily like that.

260
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's not an RPG or anything.

261
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's basically a combination of poker and bingo.

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You have so many cards, and so you're making hands based on the way you'd score in bingo.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Clarifying comment from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

264
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Game Guru says,

265
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Squeenix did release Final Fantasy 3 on the Amazon store, I believe.

266
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That makes sense.

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why not? If people are going to pay the $15 for it, go for it, right?

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah, I think they probably released it everywhere.

269
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay, so to try and wrap up, because this is only a three-hour show.

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You paid, what, $100?

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What was your donor note?

272
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
$99 for this a year ago.

273
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Here's your Ouya.

274
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
How do you feel?

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Worth it?

276
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's alright.

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Situation to tell?

278
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's alright.

279
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's a little soon to tell.

280
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I mean, it's kind of like a console that plays Xbox Live Indie games.

281
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's pretty much it.

282
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I mean, they're going to have some exclusive stuff eventually.

283
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Which is alright.

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I mean, in some of it, it's kind of like, woo, yeah.

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
With Microsoft clearly sunsetting that whole thing, unless we get surprised on the 21st.

286
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
With Microsoft clearly, that's a great vision for the console.

287
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What this reminds me of.

288
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It reminds me of this looks-wise.

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And I'm not saying this to insult the machine.

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Aesthetically, it looks like those weird kind of blingy stuff that they give you at employee fairs.

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
When they open up your medical benefits and they try to give you stuff to advertise whatever the provider is.

292
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

293
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I thought you got little squishy stress balls from that stuff.

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You get squishy balls and sometimes you get like...

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay, if that squishy ball was in a square shape with a rounded edge, yes.

297
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It looks like a cup holder that I got from one of those things.

298
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay, I'm with you there.

299
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
If you were to take the top off, that looks like a thing that literally sits on my desk at work that holds my pants.

300
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Some other things about the console.

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It doesn't just do games. Of course it does other applications.

302
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I mean, you can pretty much load anything you want on it.

303
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's got Twitch on there right now.

304
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So you can actually view Twitch streams and stuff through that.

305
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's got... I don't know if it's Stitcher.

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Some radio thing I don't actually listen to a lot.

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But I recognize the app. I just don't listen to any of these radio apps except for Pandora.

308
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But it's got a radio app on there. A music thing.

309
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And Minecraft worked great on it.

310
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Except the controls don't work because right now they have the controls locked to just the...

311
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, the controller stuff, they have it locked to the Sony one that...

312
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What was it? The...

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What the fuck is that called?

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The Sony... Remember their stupid...

315
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Almost like the PSP phone, but it wasn't the phone.

316
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, yeah.

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Experience play or something.

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So they have it locked to that.

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And a future update is going to update it with controller support.

320
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And I think it'll run.

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But it runs smooth.

322
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It runs smooth. You can use...

323
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Because it has a touch pad on the actual controller.

324
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So you can use that to click the buttons a little bit.

325
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And there's also other apps I can get, I think, where I can map stuff to the buttons.

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But I haven't bothered to try that yet.

327
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So during the break tonight here in the studio in about an hour, we're going to plug that in real quick.

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's really easy to set up, right?

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah, it's just HDMI and a power cord.

330
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So we should be able to throw that in the TV real quick.

331
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And during the break, just take a look at it because I'm dying to see what this is.

332
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The retail release of this is in what? June? Supposedly?

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
June 4th, supposedly. And they keep saying that they're not going to be late.

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I think they're going to delay it.

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But right now they're saying June 4th.

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Isn't that like right before E3?

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's an interesting time to...

338
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It is, but...

339
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's so Saturn.

340
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Well, the thing is, it's not something that really needs a huge fanfare.

341
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Because this is all a lot of these games.

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I mean, everything's basically built by the community anyway.

343
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So...

344
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
No, I mean...

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It'll be interesting.

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And there's stuff that they have, like they have MMOs that have been ported over from it and stuff.

347
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So I can show you some of the apps on there.

348
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And there's apps coming on there every day.

349
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It'll be neat.

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Well, you sound pretty enthusiastic about it even though you just said you're on the fan.

351
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm not that excited.

352
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, here's the thing.

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This isn't going to be something I'm going to be playing all the time.

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It'll be something I'll go back to every now and then.

355
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Because now that I've gotten a little bit more comfortable with playing on PC with a lot of...

356
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Because I buy a lot of Steam crap.

357
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I buy a lot of Steam crap.

358
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You and everybody else, Loki.

359
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Especially when it's sale time.

360
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm going in and actually starting to play a lot of that Steam crap that I bought.

361
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So...

362
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You know.

363
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't know.

364
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There's stuff I like on there.

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And it's all...

366
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll try to run.

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You know, play around with it.

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Good question from True in our chatroom.

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Live.vognetware.com.

370
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Does the Ouya not run hot?

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No, they've got a big fan in the bottom.

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There's actually like a fan vent in the bottom.

373
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Well, yeah.

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
They have it weighted.

375
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They have it weighted on purpose so that it doesn't tip over when you plug the cords in the back.

376
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Smart.

377
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
There is a lot of kind of quirky, smart design in it.

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Like, I love the controllers with the batteries inside.

379
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The other thing about the controllers is they have aluminum face plates on them.

380
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And they're nice and cool.

381
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's the other thing I like.

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Because if your hands get warm, these controllers stay kind of nice and cool.

383
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And they're comfortable.

384
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The other thing, like I said, I'm not a huge fan of are the shoulder buttons.

385
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But they work.

386
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I just, you know, wish they were a little bit thinner.

387
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's the important part.

388
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Alright.

389
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well, even though Loki has been talking about his gaming week of sorts.

390
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We do usually start off the show with a little bit more formal.

391
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
How was your gaming week?

392
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But I wanted to get the Ouya thing out because you've been posting to Twitter all about it this week.

393
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And so I want to get that update right off the bat.

394
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Let's talk about what else we've been playing this week.

395
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Dar Sakura, we'll start with you.

396
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, I'm doing a regular Mass Effect 3 stream on Thursday night.

397
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Can we talk about streaming for a minute?

398
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Sure.

399
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I want to give a shout out to Bobby over at the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

400
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Of course, before us here at VOG Network.

401
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And my buddy DJ Tyrant on Twitter recommended a program to me that I liked way better than the one I was using.

402
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It was called OBS, open broadcasts, and I get such a better frame rate on that.

403
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But is it just me or like, I mean, I know this whole like streaming game thing has been kind of growing over the past couple of years.

404
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But I really feel like in the past couple months, it's exploded.

405
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Like everybody's doing game streams.

406
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's just very interesting to me that it's become so easy and so many people are doing it.

407
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Like, you know, you all three of us have been doing game streams at certain times.

408
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Bobby's been doing it. And not only are you talking about just like even our listeners.

409
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I see a lot of the Twitter, you know, things like, come see my Twitch TV. It's just, it's so easy.

410
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's not just gaming either because I've seen art streams.

411
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Podcast recordings. A lot of people who don't have a set up like the network or whatever do that.

412
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:35,000
When Depeche Mode's album was about to come out, my friend Amanda, who does a lot of stuff for their official fan club, got to preview the album on a live stream.

413
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And got to basically do a live stream preview of the new album, play all the music on it. It was really good.

414
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But yeah, I think, I honestly think it's good because, I mean, the thing that I always like is if it's a game that I've seen, you know, 50,000 times, I like seeing people kind of rip it apart.

415
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Sort of do the MST3K thing, which is pretty much what I do when I go stream, is yell at people in the game who can't hear me.

416
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Tigerclaw on chat says, yeah, which is why I love it. So many games to watch people play.

417
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And what was the comment? Oh yeah. And Tigerclaw had started that off at our chat room saying, if only you could stream the Ouya on Twitch so we can see it.

418
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't have the capture card for the TV yet, but that's on the list of want to get in future.

419
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
One of my buddies sent me a link to a good one that she uses.

420
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh, nice.

421
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm getting one event soon. They'll do HDMI capture.

422
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You guys missed a pretty good stream on, I think it was Friday night. Oh my gosh. We were playing Mass Effect.

423
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And you didn't invite me?

424
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I had problems getting started. Well, the whole thing was that Shane was going to get drunk and it took him about 20 minutes.

425
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The stream lasted an hour. That's, I mean, he was gone. He passed out.

426
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Wow.

427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But it was, it was pretty funny. So there was a few that were there. I got to see it.

428
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So we need to do Wednesday night multiplayer.

429
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh, let's see. We got to, yeah, we got to dance around all the live shows on the stream, but yeah.

430
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So can I continue?

431
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yes, I'm sorry. I just want to talk about, I'm trying to promote your streaming site.

432
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Poor Shane. Whatever.

433
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But yeah, I've started doing that just because I don't, I get bored and usually, sometimes it's Dan's day off, but a lot of times he'll have a Wednesday where he works late.

434
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So, you know, I'm there by myself. What's the, you know, what's the problem? I'll hop on and chat with people and yell at video games.

435
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Then I, we got an iCade. Dan, and I saw you ordered yours. Dan ordered an iCade because Amazon has them for 44 bucks.

436
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And we're talking about marked down by about $100.

437
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So I went on a purchasing rampage trying to buy games that would work on it because I had none.

438
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And it was pretty stupid of me because I spent like the last of my play cash on going to the baseball game last night too, which was really good.

439
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But I got Pac-Man, the Atari's Greatest Hits. I already had Fix-It Felix, but I can't figure out how to get it to work.

440
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Metal Slug 3, the Midway Arcade, Blazing Star, and the Namco Arcade.

441
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So I bought one game on the Namco Arcade, which was Galaga. I tried playing Starblade with the iCade and Starblade doesn't work.

442
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Like a lot of these will have like a one day demo thing that you can play through unless you buy tokens or the full version of the game.

443
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And for most of these, the full version of the game is like a couple bucks.

444
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Metal Slug 3 was about $5. It was worth it.

445
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I thought of another game that supports, I think supports iCade that you might not have. It's the Activision Collection.

446
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And I think Kaboom is free on that. I don't remember. One of the games is free that you get with that.

447
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I've got plenty right now.

448
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
When you told me the iCades were on sale, I ordered one.

449
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So I'm getting it Monday. I'm excited.

450
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Because I grabbed an app in the marketplace called Gridley a couple months ago, which is just the MAME emulator in disguise.

451
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And I know a lot of you guys are like, but emulators are bad.

452
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But I support the real deals too. But since there aren't a lot of real deals on iOS for these things, I can't wait.

453
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
My cocktail cabinet on the bar top is just collecting dust at my work.

454
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Let's be real guys. Are they ever going to put out Miss Nude World 96 as an app? I doubt it.

455
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It has Miss Nude World 96 on it too.

456
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The only way I will ever get to play Miss Nude World 96 is to turn to the dark side. Sorry, Jamie.

457
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Okay. I'm probably going to be cancelling well.

458
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Because unless these bastards don't ever get back to me, because I have been trying and trying and trying.

459
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Ragnarok Online 2 went into free to play.

460
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I saw that and I thought of you this week on Steam.

461
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So I tried. And I had registered through whatever Gravity's new site is for it.

462
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And so now I can't register it through Steam.

463
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And it's in the same freaking problem that it had back with the old IRO.

464
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Was that you can't find the installer anywhere.

465
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And I tried to download from one of their mirrors and it kept quitting on me.

466
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So I'm like, I could download the Steam one fine, but I couldn't run it.

467
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And so it says, if you have problems, email, blah, blah, blah.

468
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm like, not replying to me yet. So I don't know what to do.

469
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So I'm really supremely pissed.

470
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And I still need to update my PSO2.

471
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
God, I played something else. I don't remember.

472
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Alright.

473
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Seriously.

474
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Then we'll go over to Loki.

475
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I played a few things.

477
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I finally installed, granted that a...

478
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I tried installing Andreas on there.

479
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And I got it to work, but mapping the buttons to the Xbox 360 controller are...

480
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It's pretty much impossible to get it to work correctly.

481
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So I kind of gave up on that.

482
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm still trying to get my copy back from my sister, but she put it in storage.

483
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So I have to get it.

484
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What was she thinking putting your game in storage?

485
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I basically gave her the PlayStation 2.

486
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I guess siblings can get away with that a little more.

487
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That's fine. I'm not a huge fan of Andreas. I've already played it.

488
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I wanted to play it on PC because I have it on PC, but I can't map the buttons correctly.

489
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
They have a program to do it, but it doesn't work right and you have to un-patch the game.

490
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's just a pain in the ass, so I'm just not worrying about that.

491
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I got four episodes from Liberty City on there.

492
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I played it for a little bit and I'm like,

493
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Cool, I'm going to play episodes from Liberty City and I'm going to play Deathmatch.

494
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And I'm going to totally dominate Deathmatch.

495
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And there's no one on fucking line anymore.

496
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
There's nobody, nobody at all playing any sort of ranked Deathmatch or Deathmatch or anything.

497
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's all fucking free mode.

498
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Free mode's fun, but I want to play a competitive game in Grand Theft Auto.

499
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I can't do that anymore because no one plays it.

500
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Which is why I need Grand Theft Auto 5.

501
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And it's such a fucking cock tease to have three fucking trailers and extended previews all over the god damn internet.

502
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I need this game. It's my crack.

503
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I need it. I'm feended for this game.

504
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So yeah, Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to be awesome.

505
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I can't wait to play it.

506
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I guess I don't even need to ask about those trailers that came out this week and how you felt.

507
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Oh, they're fantastic.

508
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I think you made it pretty clear.

509
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's fantastic.

510
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Well, even there was like a 90 minute kind of talking about it.

511
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Because basically everyone was shown about 30 minutes of gameplay.

512
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That talked everything about from the mechanic between switching between each protagonist in the game.

513
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And how they're...

514
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You know, the map is about five times the size of Red Dead Redemption.

515
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
One and a half times of Red Dead Redemption's worth in the ocean.

516
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Under the ocean, actually.

517
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So there's a lot of scuba diving in the game.

518
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You can pretty much do whatever...

519
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I mean, you can do whatever you want in the game, but it's just so much to explore.

520
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's just gonna...

521
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's gonna be awesome.

522
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And just a lot of mechanics in the game sound really good.

523
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Like the heists and how you have to do missions to kind of do recon on different things.

524
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And set up the actual heists and you hire your people to help you out.

525
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It just looks like a very good game.

526
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And a very good storyline going along with that.

527
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Actual games I played.

528
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Saints Row the Third.

529
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm still trying to go through and finish off my achievements that don't involve co-op.

530
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But I'm just getting so bored with a lot of these games that...

531
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Like, I don't know what I want to play anymore.

532
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Because I can't think of anything that I want to play that sounds exciting.

533
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You know, like Grand Theft Auto V.

534
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I can't think of anything other than Saints Row IV and Grand Theft Auto V and maybe Earth Defense Force 2025.

535
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But none of those are coming out yet.

536
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And so I'm kind of in this weird position where, yeah, I'm just kind of going on autopilot and playing stuff.

537
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't really want to play, but I'm kind of playing it anyways.

538
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
One thing I did notice on Saints Row the Third, though, is their AI pathing doesn't account for the fact that there's...

539
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
A section in the game, or actually a very large section in the game, where they raise the bridges in the game.

540
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So that, you know, because it's a security thing and they're trying to, like, trap the Saints on the island and stuff.

541
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And the cars don't realize that the bridge is up.

542
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So they keep trying to go up the bridge and they just crash and crash and crash and then explode and crash again.

543
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And it was hilarious. It's like standing there watching the cars just try to go straight.

544
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That sounds like some Driver 3 shit right there.

545
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That almost inspired me to even bring my singing voice and do, like, a Buggy Saints Row the Third, you know.

546
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That is begging for the Benny Hill theme.

547
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's just seriously like, what? This is so terrible.

548
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
There's even a mission I had to do where I had to stop this. Basically, it's an assassination mission.

549
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You have to kill this guy before he kills him. He's going to commit suicide by jumping off the bridge.

550
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And so she needs to collect the money, you know, insurance money, but, you know, it's null and void if he commits suicide.

551
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But the bridges are up, so he spawns in the water. He's not dead.

552
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I mean, he wouldn't even die from that drop because it's not that big of a drop. It's just like a small bridge.

553
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And so I just had to make my way around to shoot him from the side of the, you know, the shore.

554
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But it was just so stupid and buggy. It just all messed up.

555
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Or, like, I was supposed to do this other assassination mission where I was supposed to dress up like one of the gangs, the Deckers.

556
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And so I go to my hideout because I don't even, I can't seem to find the clothing option to put it on and all.

557
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And so I'm sorting through my wardrobe and stuff and all of a sudden I start getting shot.

558
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm like, what the hell is going on? And I look and the guy that I'm supposed to be assassinating somehow came into my safe house and just starts shooting at me.

559
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm like, how the fuck did this guy even get here in the first place? He's not even supposed to be coming after me yet because I don't have the right outfit on.

560
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I haven't even found this guy. It's just ridiculous.

561
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You know, I know people have their opinions on you and your strong opinions about Nintendo and other things.

562
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But, you know, it's amazing to me how when you really like a game, you will make that game last forever.

563
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I've bought it, like, on two platforms already.

564
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Oh, that's great.

565
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So I've, I don't know. So anyways, and then beyond that, Ouya played lots of games on the Ouya and we talked about a lot of those already.

566
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And what else did I play this week? More Call of Duty.

567
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I actually am playing through a little bit more of the story campaign on three, which is it's all right.

568
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's just it's Call of Duty. They don't have a great, they don't have a great story.

569
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I mean, it's cinematic. It's kind of fun. You don't play Call of Duty for the story.

570
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
No, you don't really. You don't really play for the story. You play for the act. It's just watching, like, an action movie. I mean, come on.

571
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And Minecraft X-Ray LA, because we did a VOG gaming night, actually had so much show this time. Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.

572
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
That's all right. It's all good.

573
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I really wanted to go, but I had to work on one of my other projects that night.

574
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's all good.

575
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But you're doing Forza this week, right?

576
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
This week we're doing Forza Horizons.

577
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I will be there.

578
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'll bring out more people, so.

579
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'll be there.

580
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Forza Horizon this Thursday, 8 p.m. Pacific time. Probably goes for about two hours.

581
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So at least that's how long I can play.

582
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I might not be there right at 8, but I'll be there.

583
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's all right.

584
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
All right. Yeah.

585
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Okay, before we get to my gaming week, Dark Soccer, you wanted to add one.

586
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I did forget one more. Tomb Raider.

587
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
The new one.

588
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah, which I have now officially stolen Alan's name for it. It's Girl.

589
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Or what is it, Lara Croft?

590
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Lara Croft's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.

591
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And how was it?

592
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
BCPC sale on Steam this weekend, right?

593
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah, it's half price, so since I had a lovely gift from Loki, thank you, of $20 in my Steam wallet.

594
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And no pressure at all from Tim, who was here last week.

595
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Well, I intended on getting it eventually anyway, but I only paid $8 for it, so.

596
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Nice. All right.

597
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Good times with it?

598
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That poor girl.

599
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The opening sequence, you're like, damn.

600
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Like, how could your day get worse? Oh, let's fall off a plane.

601
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You could get impaled by a tree.

602
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I probably died five times at the beginning of the game.

603
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah, but it's not the end of the world. Like, the death isn't super frustrating in that game.

604
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And it starts you pretty much right from the section you left off on.

605
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Right.

606
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But I need to find the picture on my Tumblr and post it in chat for everybody.

607
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Sounds good. Live.vognetwork.com.

608
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
My Gaming Week, I'll try to be kind of quick here, because I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

609
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
In fact, I spent a lot of time playing some old stuff.

610
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Virtual Console on Wii U, go figure.

611
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I actually bought a lot of stuff on it, I'm kind of embarrassed to say.

612
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But Mega Man, the old school Mega Man came out this week, and how could I not?

613
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Like, the Mega Man games have some of the best soundtracks.

614
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah, so I had to check it out on Virtual Console, and I'm loving the whole

615
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
restore points are a godsend in stages like Ice Man's stage.

616
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That stage can go to hell for those blocks that appear or disappear.

617
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But yeah, I've been having a good time with that.

618
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Otherwise, there's another game, but Darkstalker is going to bring it up later in the show.

619
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So I'll wait to get my comments on that until later.

620
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Oh, I was on Steam randomly last night, and I was looking at the free-to-play games,

621
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
and I was going to do Ragnarok Online 2, but I decided instead to play Puzzle Pirates.

622
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Remember Puzzle Pirates?

623
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I saw that the other day.

624
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm like, that's on Steam?

625
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah, I know, right?

626
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That was sweet.

627
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I was like, God, that took me back.

628
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
That was like, we all played that.

629
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's what we used to play when we were all playing DDR regularly.

630
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Like, a ton of us were playing Puzzle Pirates.

631
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I remember I reamed on a song.

632
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I didn't play it at the time.

633
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But I think actually during those days, I was playing Ragnarok Online.

634
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And the building is still the same freaking thing with the match.

635
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But they've added a lot to it.

636
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Like, you have rooms that you customize.

637
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It's definitely a game that they put out there for more lower-end PCs.

638
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You could probably play Puzzle Pirates just fine on a netbook.

639
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's that kind of game.

640
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So yeah, that was kind of fun to just kind of get back into that again.

641
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Otherwise, World of Warcraft, Mass Effect 3, a lot of the usual suspects.

642
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And another game that I'm going to be reviewing on VoG soon.

643
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So stay tuned for that.

644
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Okay.

645
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Let's get into some gaming news.

646
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Quick, plugs for the Twitters, the Facebooks and all that.

647
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R is where you can follow us on Twitter.

648
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

649
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And I don't really have a whole lot else to add.

650
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We may not be here Memorial Day weekend.

651
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I may be gone.

652
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But we'll let you know in the next couple weeks.

653
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So stay tuned for all that live programming information.

654
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
All right.

655
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Let's talk about the gaming news.

656
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Loki, start us off tonight.

657
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Okay.

658
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So apparently the Wii U has now been hacked.

659
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Or at least the mod chip creators behind the Wii key.

660
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
They have now said that they have claimed to, I guess, compromise Wii U security.

661
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And completely reverse the Wii U drive authentication,

662
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
disk encryption, file system and everything else.

663
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And yeah.

664
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And I guess what's supposed to come of this

665
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
is that they're going to either create a replacement optical drive

666
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
that will go into your Wii U.

667
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Or they're going to create some sort of...

668
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Like I've seen this before with some of the Xbox 360 drives

669
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
where they'll have a daughter board or something like that

670
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
that replaces a board on there

671
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
and you can just kind of hook in the ribbon cables

672
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and it's a bypass or something.

673
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So they'll have something like that.

674
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And the Wii key...

675
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Actually the Wii key, I want to say...

676
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
No, that's not the mod chip I have in my Wii.

677
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I actually have a Cyclo Wii.

678
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It was that one.

679
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But the Wii keys were pretty similar.

680
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It was just kind of like a...

681
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
They had a few quick solder points

682
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and they just soldered straight onto the board on the disk drive.

683
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And to kind of show, I guess, how serious that this is,

684
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
they've also dumped their first game,

685
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth.

686
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
One of the probably most terrible games out there.

687
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But they have dumped it and...

688
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Well, somebody's dumped it

689
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and it's been released out there on the internet

690
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
to download and do nothing with

691
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
because there's no such mod chip to play it on yet.

692
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But yeah, Nintendo is aware of it.

693
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
They say that they're going to find a way to bypass everything.

694
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
But thus begins the back and forth struggle

695
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
that is hacking and patching,

696
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
more hacking and more patching, so on and so forth.

697
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And so far, there's really no homebrew version

698
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
or homebrew needs of this.

699
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I guess maybe you can make your own software for the Wii U,

700
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
but this is mainly piracy.

701
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Hackers going to hack.

702
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Or backups, I guess, if you will.

703
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah, sure.

704
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Okay, so I think the real question to ask here, though,

705
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
is how hard is this to pull off?

706
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Because the harder it is, the less impact this is going to have.

707
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We know that the pirates and the people

708
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
that are all about wanting to steal games,

709
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
or make backups, as fast as they can,

710
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
they're always going to find a way in.

711
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
But the question is, how easy is it

712
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
for somebody else to do that?

713
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
This is going to be like a mod chip.

714
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So you're going to have to buy a mod chip.

715
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You're going to have to install the mod chip onto your system

716
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
or install some sort of part on your system.

717
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
This isn't like the Wii homebrew channel

718
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
where it was a hack that modified your dashboard

719
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
to run a program that you could then

720
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
run games off a hard drive.

721
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's not that simple. You have to buy a mod chip.

722
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Can Nintendo brick your console

723
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
with a firmware update if you were running this?

724
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
They may threaten to do that.

725
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't know if they can.

726
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
There's drive emulators and stuff like that

727
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
that are already out there.

728
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Why don't they do it?

729
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
My point is, why would Nintendo play softball with this?

730
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
If they want to be like,

731
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
don't fuck with us.

732
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Because of false positives is what it is.

733
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Because if you have someone that legitimately

734
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
hasn't done anything and fucked their console up,

735
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
they're already in not a very strong position

736
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
with their console and to piss people off like that.

737
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Also, they're probably going to let this thing get released,

738
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
get people to buy the console because they're like,

739
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
oh, I'm going to hack all this stuff up and then patch it.

740
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Okay.

741
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's smart.

742
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
That's what I would think they would do.

743
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
How many people went and got a PSP

744
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
the day they heard that NES emulators are runnable on it?

745
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
On top of that though,

746
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
they're probably going to be prompted

747
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
if this does come out pretty widespread,

748
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
they're going to be prompted by their third party developers

749
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
that hey, we need you to fix this

750
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
because we're not making a lot off of these Wii games already

751
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and if we're making even less now because people are pirating them,

752
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
it's going to be a tough thing.

753
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And also, here's the other thing you've got to consider too,

754
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
these aren't necessarily DVDs that they're running on anymore

755
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
so you're going to have to have a Blu-ray burner

756
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and Blu-ray media to do that.

757
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I think that stuff's come down.

758
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That stuff's coming way down.

759
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
We're only a couple of years away from that being standard really for PCs.

760
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
But if anything, I could see them go on the route of the X key or something

761
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,000
where it's basically a drive in the middle board

762
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
that allows you to run.

763
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It'll emulate the drive and you'll run stuff off a hard drive

764
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and it's going to be easy like that.

765
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
The way I see it, they're going to do it.

766
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But right now, it's progress I guess.

767
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But if they've completely reversed the file system and stuff,

768
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
who's to say that they can't come up with their own modified dashboard

769
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
that will run on there

770
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
because if they've figured out how to do the file system stuff

771
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and then the keys for that.

772
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The hacking community is going to have an interesting case to make too.

773
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I understand why they wanted to do Homebrew Channel on Wii

774
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
because there wasn't a lot of indie friendly stuff on the Wii.

775
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But Wii U is really trying to make a case.

776
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
We are the indie friendly platform.

777
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You've even heard the indie developers come out and say,

778
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I know this is going to shock people,

779
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
but Nintendo is the platform to be on right now if you're indie.

780
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So does the hacking community have as much of a case

781
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
when it seems like Nintendo is really embracing a lot of the Homebrew stuff open arms?

782
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Well, I shouldn't say Homebrew, but indie stuff open arms,

783
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:58,000
thus negating the need for a Homebrew channel that is totally clean without piracy.

784
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't think that they're really going to...

785
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's just one hacking group doing something and that's it.

786
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So you're going to have people that want to...

787
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
They're in the business of selling mod chips,

788
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
so they're going to want to make a mod chip to sell.

789
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And we use just the console at the moment.

790
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
As soon as PlayStation 4 is out, they'll be working on that too.

791
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Of course, yeah.

792
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
All right, well, Loki alluded to this a minute ago,

793
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
and I was mentioning this earlier in the show

794
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
when they were teasing me about the Wii message light being on,

795
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
but Nintendo actually sent a message to all the Wii owners this week saying,

796
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
hey, have you checked out the Wii U?

797
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So it seems odd to me that it took them this long to do it,

798
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
but they did send a message to everybody that says,

799
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
quote, did you know that you can play nearly all of your existing Wii games on Wii U?

800
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I thought you could play every Wii game on Wii U.

801
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Why did they say nearly all?

802
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I think they're counting maybe virtual console and stuff.

803
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Is there some stuff that you can't quite port over?

804
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Maybe it's something to save their ass if something doesn't work.

805
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Yeah, it's possible.

806
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Maybe, yeah, that's true.

807
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Your Wii controllers and many Wii accessories can also be used with the new Wii U console,

808
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
along with any downloaded games, save data,

809
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and other info stored in your existing Wii console.

810
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Wii U is the all-new home console from Nintendo.

811
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's not just an upgrade.

812
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It's an entirely new system that will change the way you and your family experience games and entertainment.

813
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Do you hear that, Jimmy Fallon? It's not just an upgrade.

814
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That's a big problem, though.

815
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I mean, think about it.

816
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,000
If they have to go out there and tell people, hey, guys, it's not just a peripheral, it's an upgrade,

817
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
they've done a poor job marketing it then.

818
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Well, that and maybe this is a case now where the name issue is finally biting Nintendo.

819
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
A lot of people razz them for the Wii name, and that ended up working.

820
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It didn't matter. Nintendo did great with that.

821
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But this whole Wii U name, I think maybe Nintendo's wondering,

822
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I don't know if they are, but I think a lot of people are going, maybe that really wasn't the best name.

823
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
They should have started off calling it the U.

824
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Or, well, Super Wii, which is, isn't that what they call it in Japan?

825
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Something that translates to Super Wii?

826
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Something like that?

827
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah, Koopa Kid Jeremy in our chat right there says,

828
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
this just proves they should have called it something else.

829
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Mm-hmm. Agree.

830
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Anyhow, what I think is interesting about this also,

831
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Iwata, Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata, said in a financial results briefing last week that,

832
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
quote, we have not been able to solidly communicate the product value of Wii U to our consumers yet,

833
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
which has been a grand challenge for us.

834
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
We have the misunderstanding that Wii U is just Wii with a pad for games,

835
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
and others even consider Wii U GamePad as a peripheral device connectable to Wii.

836
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Wii feel deeply responsible for not having tried hard enough to have consumers understand the product.

837
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Have they done the commercial onslaught that they did with Wii?

838
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Like, I remember all those commercials, Wii would like to play, and that whole thing.

839
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
That was a pretty good marketing plan. Now they have, like,

840
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Did they do that at all?

841
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
They have a new marketing campaign going on right now that's really dumb.

842
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It's basically these families coming in, and they're, like, bussing them in by, or,

843
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
vanning them in, whatever, taking them by a van,

844
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and bringing them to Nintendo headquarters to try the Wii U out for the first time,

845
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
and they're like, Oh my God! Nintendo stuff is so awesome! This is the best thing ever!

846
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Oh, this GamePad is so amazing! This is gonna change it all!

847
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And it's just, like, seriously, just one issue.

848
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
If Nintendo really wants to get their message across about the Wii U, here's what they need to do.

849
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
They're gonna need to release a Mario soccer game this Christmas,

850
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and they need to take it out across America to all the little peewee soccer championships,

851
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
so all their target audience, the moms and dads of the soccer kids, can play Mario soccer,

852
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
and then they can all gossip amongst themselves and get the word out.

853
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Like, that's how Nintendo reaches their core audience, right? Soccer games.

854
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Eh?

855
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Bowling!

856
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
They are at malls.

857
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The problem is you have people that were really excited about the Wii, you know, like myself,

858
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and bought it because it was a very innovative product at the time.

859
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Granted, we wish it was kind of like, you know, graphics of the Xbox 360 and PS3.

860
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I was in it for the donuts.

861
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And so you bought it, and then you're like, Hmm. I'm not playing anything on it.

862
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I bought these Mario games. Now I'm not really playing anything on it.

863
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And then the new system comes out, and you're like, Well, okay. It's got this cool game pad on it.

864
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Okay, but hold on, though, because there would be that one or two games a year that are like,

865
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
you know, Metroid Prime 3, Mario Galaxy, Zelda Skyward Sword.

866
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
You know, there are those big, big games that are like, Okay, I gotta play some.

867
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
First party games?

868
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Yes.

869
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
A game's a game in this case, yes.

870
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah, it's fantastic, and then when, you know, the developers are so behind, you know, the Wii and stuff,

871
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
in fact, they thought it was so great that they decided, Hey, EA said, Hey, you know what?

872
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
We're gonna put out FIFA on this system every year.

873
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Oh, it's not gonna be a different FIFA, but it'll be the same FIFA every year.

874
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Because, you know, we don't want to put any money into it.

875
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
That's different. That's different. You can't blame Nintendo for what EA did.

876
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Okay. Konami decided, Hey, you know what? We're gonna do Pro-E.

877
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You can't blame them for that either.

878
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
What is it with soccer games? I mean, seriously.

879
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That would be like me blaming Microsoft for all those terrible rehashes in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade.

880
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
That wasn't Microsoft's fault.

881
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Can't blame them for all the shovelware on the Wii?

882
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
No, no.

883
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I just think there wasn't, the Wii U, the step from the Wii, or like, you know, previous generation, the GameCube to the Wii,

884
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
there was a big jump as far as gameplay, innovation, stuff like that.

885
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
When you have the Wii U, where the only thing really different with it is, it has a gamepad now that you can use with a touchscreen,

886
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and it's HD.

887
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But it plays all the, you know, it does everything else that the Wii does.

888
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It wasn't that kind of a wow factor to it.

889
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I mean, you had like something good and then, everyone's not gonna be clamoring to get it because they're like,

890
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Well, I can play Wii Bowling on this, right? Okay.

891
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Well, why do I need to buy a new system to play the same game I'm already playing?

892
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Or, you know, hey, cool that they're gonna have a new Mario game, but it kinda looks like the other Mario game that I bought a couple years ago.

893
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So, the short version of what you just said I'm hearing is, Nintendo Land was not Wii Sports.

894
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Nintendo Land wasn't Wii Sports, and I don't think it was, it was a system seller.

895
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
A big, big chunk of people, I feel like we, this is a very deja vu conversation, so we need to move on here a minute.

896
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It was like Wii Sports, Nintendo version or something.

897
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
How many people that bought the Wii were not buying the Wii?

898
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
They were not buying the Wii, they were buying Wii Sports and the console that came with it.

899
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
That was a big chunk of people that bought the Wii.

900
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah, because it was kinda cool, because for the first time, you're gonna be able to like play tennis by like actually standing up in the room and swinging your arms.

901
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And that was a big experience for people. It was like, whoa, you know, for once, I can actually play a game, I don't need to figure out the controls, I just play like I would kinda play tennis.

902
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And, you know, I would bowl like I would bowl. You know, it was very natural for people.

903
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But then, going to Nintendo Land, it's like, well, it's not that different.

904
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Well, this is kinda similar to what I've already done on the Wii, but why do I need to spend the extra money to play this game that's very similar to what I already have?

905
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That was the problem, it wasn't just, it wasn't a big hook that got people in.

906
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
That gamepad was not enough hook to get people onto the system.

907
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Maybe if they'd put out a game, like, you know, the thing about Wii Sports is that everybody generally knows those sports. Everybody knows bowling.

908
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Specifically within Wii Sports, that bowling mini-game, maybe the tennis to an extent too, but those two games specifically were just huge.

909
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And maybe Nintendo Wii U needed something, it needed that for, or still needs, it could still come out this Christmas, needs something like that that everybody just knows.

910
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You know bowling, you know, but you don't necessarily know Donkey Kong Crash Course or F-Zero, you don't necessarily know that stuff.

911
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I don't know why, but my mind goes to like maybe a board game or a card game thing, especially if you could like play it online or something, but that would require Nintendo to understand online.

912
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The problem is, for the Wii U, I think what they would have needed to have done is like done something completely different than the Wii.

913
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Like, I don't know, come up with, I can't really think of what they would have to do.

914
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Here you go, Tiger Claw says, too bad Wii Sports didn't have online multiplayer, sucks playing by yourself against the computer. Kabam, Wii Sports 2, online.

915
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But the thing with the Wii, what they're pushing though, is that it's a family party atmosphere is what it is.

916
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
But that's not the dynamic anymore. That used to be the dynamic when it was like, you know, offline games that had four controller ports.

917
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Like the GameCube was, you know, you got people in the room and you're playing together on TV split screen.

918
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That's not how it is anymore. It's over the internet playing multiplayer because people don't live near each other.

919
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:56,000
You now have friends. Instead of having friends in your neighborhood and maybe a pen pal or something in another state, you have friends all over the world because everyone's so connected now.

920
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
That's true. I probably do more gaming with Shane in Kansas than anybody else.

921
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Exactly. Like distance isn't a thing anymore, really. I mean, you talk to people, you probably talk to people more that are like further away than you do like your neighbors and stuff.

922
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So it's not the thing. And that's the thing. Like I don't, like the Wii, you know, it was kind of fun playing the Wii stuff, but it was all party game stuff.

923
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And I can't see myself getting the Wii U because, hey, now five people could play. Cool. I don't have five people in my house ever.

924
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Okay. YYR with a valid counter statement in our chat room at live.vognetware.com. The audience for Wii Sports probably didn't care that much about online play.

925
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
True. But hear me out here a minute, YYR, because you have that camera on every Wii U console.

926
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:48,000
What if grandma could play bowling with her grandkids thanks to the internet technology in that case, like every Wii U could have...

927
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It would be awesome.

928
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:56,000
That would be amazing. But Nintendo, like Nintendo's sitting on that gold mine and they, that's not what they want to do for some reason.

929
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Because that's all they were showing is like, hey, but you could do FaceTime back and forth and talk to grandma.

930
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Make grandma understand why she wants to play online. Maybe if grandma understood why that would be a great thing, that's not such an issue anymore.

931
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
But I respect your point, YYR. I get what you're saying.

932
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I understand.

933
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah, I totally do too. I just think Nintendo could invent a reason why you want to be online. Anyhow.

934
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Part of me also thinks though that I've had this view of Nintendo as sort of the traditionalist and how social should be.

935
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And the fact that they actually want to get people together in the same room doing in-person gaming.

936
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I mean, it almost seems to me that they've got an agenda to encourage that. And I don't know. I don't see them changing off of that anytime really soon.

937
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I got to go back to like real quick, you know, because that does make sense that that may be their agenda.

938
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:02,000
But then you got to go to the movie Joe Dirt where there's the guy with, you know, the fireworks stand and all he has is sparklers and those little snakes.

939
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And he's like, but that's what I like. But you can't just think about what you like or what your focus may be. You have to think about other people out there.

940
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I understand that may be the focus that you want people to gain in the room, but you know what would be awesome too?

941
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Is say you want to have that gaming experience, but you can't get your friends over. You know, say that, you know, they're gone somewhere and you want to play with them anyways.

942
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Think about all the options.

943
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Koopa kid Jeremy in our chat room says, keep grandma off the internet. Old people opening 90 tabs, all of them yahoo.com.

944
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Oh, you know, why did your friend Billy send me this link? What is what is two girls, one cup? What is this?

945
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,000
You know, it's actually hilarious. Dan's grandmother is super into the internet. She does her genealogy.

946
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Oh, that's my dad. That's my dad. She's probably one of the most computer literate people in her age group that did not start off in programming or engineering that I know.

947
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And it's pretty neat to watch her. However, my maternal grandmother, she will like poke around a little bit and maybe look at Facebook and then that's it.

948
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,000
My granny's like, no, those things. I don't want to look at them. Your daddy's going to mess with that. Not me.

949
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Whereas my mother is all about Twitter. She doesn't post on it. I told I told her, Mom, if you would use Twitter, I could give out your name and you would have so many followers because your tweets would be like you need to tweet about American Idol and shit and things that get you really angry.

950
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:34,000
But she just she loves to read it. She'll tell me about, you know, what Kathy Griffin and Cher posting on Twitter and and all the people that she follows.

951
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's like that's the Internet. I love Kathy Griffin and Cher and Anderson Cooper.

952
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,000
They all need to do a buddy comedy. All right. We have distanced ourselves way away from the original topic, which means next topic, Dark Sakura.

953
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Oh, yes. My turn, isn't it? God damn it, Rob. Making me work. Well, there's a little game called Fire Emblem.

954
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And this is actually for Fire Emblem Awakening Summer Scramble is the new DLC. It's out in North America and Europe.

955
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:15,000
But they have censored a scene. There is a character named Tharja who I guess she's like pulling out her underwear or something or pulling it up.

956
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But the edit that they made to it makes it even worse because there's like a piece of cloth now, like a curtain or something that's flowed in between where her butt is.

957
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And so all you see is like if you weren't looking for the little strap on the side, it would look like she's got her hands in her ass.

958
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Like she's digging her fingers and she's self muppeting. It's I like that.

959
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'm going to have to work in the more conversations. Is that an urban dictionary? That should be, though.

960
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
But like, it's just the OK.

961
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And this is my big thing about censorship, is that the only reason the shit's a big deal is because you make it a fucking big deal.

962
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You know, it's like the approach I take, I take to quote foul language around kids.

963
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
You know, if you're not supposed to say the words, that's just going to make it all the more attractive to say it.

964
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You know, if you'd act like it's not a big deal to them, it's not a big deal.

965
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Same goes with, you know, censorship of, you know, a woman pulling up her underwear.

966
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The way that they edit. It's a bathing suit.

967
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:37,000
What they did to this, it just makes it look even worse because it went, you know, when you give somebody a clear, concrete picture, it leaves a little room to the imagination.

968
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Like black bars. Exactly. We did this in college is that we were making a music video and we had the guy stand out in just a pair of like gym shorts.

969
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
But when we did the movie, we put a black bar over it because it was supposed to be the girls.

970
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Why am I talking about this on the show? We did like a Spice Girls music video for a college project.

971
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And at the end of the video, the girls talking, shut up. The girls steal his clothes.

972
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And so at the end, he's just standing there with a black bar over it. Well, he didn't get naked for us.

973
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
He was wearing gym shorts and we put the black bar over it and it looked like he was naked.

974
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's an illusion. And your pervy little minds don't think, oh, he's wearing gym shorts.

975
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
They think, oh, well, it's like you had to block his penis.

976
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Well, it's like you can also, here's a good example of the Austin Powers movie.

977
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
The first one. Oh, God. Yes. With the cantaloupe. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

978
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:33,000
She had like red pasties over the jumblies to steal Mystique's word.

979
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:41,000
But I mean, when you take away the concrete image and you put just something in front of it,

980
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
it's going to leave a lot more to the imagination.

981
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And in the end, I think it's going to, you know, probably be more unintentionally explicit,

982
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
because the brain, if it can be porned, the brain will porn it.

983
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And too, since I worked in a classy reference to Joe Dirt in the last topic,

984
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm going to reference Bioshock Infinite in this one.

985
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
The mind of the subject will desperately struggle to create memories where none exists.

986
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
In other words, they will undress the bitch when they can't see her clothes.

987
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And also think of the children. Think of the children.

988
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
How many children are playing Fire Emblem? How many children can understand Fire Emblem?

989
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It's a 3DS game. All of the children are playing Fire Emblem.

990
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I guess I say that and then I'm like, oh, wait a minute, Rob, when you were 10,

991
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
you were totally playing Final Fantasy. So I guess.

992
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Here's another fun example, because Prince Brightstar mentioned the black bars in Japan.

993
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Remember when we got Final Fuck X and it was all squared out, the pixelated?

994
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I was like, we know that's badge.

995
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
OK, we need to switch topic stat, Loki.

996
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
For the record, that was entirely hilarious.

997
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It was just cosplay porn. I mean, there wasn't even any male characters that were dressed up like Final Fantasy characters.

998
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
It was really good cosplay, though.

999
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Fine. Anyway, so there was a game that came out called Scribblenauts Unlimited,

1000
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
and they keep adding stuff each year. Well, this year they added some mames.

1001
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And to go along with that, Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat were some of the characters featured in the game.

1002
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And guess what? They're copyrighted.

1003
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
But apparently Fissel or Warner Brothers didn't really give a shit,

1004
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
or just were blatantly unaware that things get copyrighted on the Internet and that kind of stuff.

1005
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So, yeah, apparently the creators of those two properties are a little pissed off,

1006
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
and they have filed a lawsuit.

1007
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Because, apparently, neither Fissel or Warner Brothers were even acknowledging it.

1008
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Just kind of like, eh.

1009
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And, you know, they-

1010
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It's just some Internet kids.

1011
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:13,000
And, you know, they do support the fact that people make things on the Internet for non-profit stuff, and that's fine.

1012
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But this is clearly for-profit. It was something that they advertised to the game, saying,

1013
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
hey, look, Nyan Cat's in there, and Keyboard Cat, you should buy this game.

1014
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And people were like, oh, cool, I'm gonna buy the game because of that.

1015
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So, yeah.

1016
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Well, just like the Nintendo version had Mario and Luigi in it, and they had to work out that deal with Nintendo.

1017
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That's why they're not in the PC version, right?

1018
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Mm-hmm.

1019
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It's very similar.

1020
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I kind of think a lot of this is ignorance.

1021
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I kind of think- I don't think the developers meant to do this maliciously.

1022
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
No, I don't think that's malicious.

1023
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I don't- I think they just thought, oh, Nyan Cat's like this 4chan thing, nobody really owns it, so let's just, you know, lift it.

1024
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It'll be funny for our game.

1025
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:55,000
But, now that WB, the parent company, is not returning these guys' phone calls, who, yeah, it is a trademark thing or whatever,

1026
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
now they're pissed off, and this is their warning shot to get noticed.

1027
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It'll get settled out of court, as these things always do.

1028
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah.

1029
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
But, uh, very interesting.

1030
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
The precedent for the meme stuff is very interesting.

1031
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And how this could affect future Scrimble lot games.

1032
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I don't think the keyboard cat thing is as- like, the Nyan Cat, yeah, that one's gonna be pretty hard to defend,

1033
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
because that looks just like the little kitty.

1034
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
But the keyboard cat is just a cat sitting at the piano.

1035
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
It doesn't have that song, I don't even think the colors are right.

1036
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I don't- and keyboard cat's a little trickier.

1037
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I kind of think that's just thrown in for good measure.

1038
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I don't know if that has quite the legal-

1039
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
They also have, like, long cat and stuff, I think, are in the game, and-

1040
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
But I don't think anybody owns long cat.

1041
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
No, I don't think so.

1042
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Yeah.

1043
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Um, now I wanna know if, um, My Body is Ready is in there.

1044
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And then what that does-

1045
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Uh, My Body is Ready is not a noun, though, so...

1046
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And, um...

1047
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Did I say a noun? I think I did.

1048
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Noun.

1049
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But, I mean, there- I- I think that, though, um,

1050
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I know that there are a number of memes out there that are, um, under copyright.

1051
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And I think that they're well- well within their right to pursue action.

1052
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Sure.

1053
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And especially, um, I really- and this is maybe just a- a guilty pleasure.

1054
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I love seeing the big companies taken down a notch.

1055
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Yeah.

1056
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I mean, there's a lot of people quick to defend Scribblenauts and stuff,

1057
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
and it's not- it's not that I'm, like, anti-Scribblenauts or I wanna see Scribblenauts.

1058
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
No, I love Scribblenauts. It's a cute game and so forth.

1059
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
But, okay, I also like the internet culture and a lot of what the internet brings up.

1060
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,000
It actually- some of these meme things, I really like to see how it turns around some people's lives.

1061
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Like, think about that chick, the, um, ain't nobody got time for that when she was on the local news.

1062
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
She's got, like, commercial deals now.

1063
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Or Antoine.

1064
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Like, things- that guy, there was a really interesting development with him this week.

1065
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
But, yeah, I mean, for all practical purposes, he's, you know, did a lot with his stuff, too.

1066
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
The whole, they're clamming in your windows, they're snatching people up.

1067
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
You know, they milk their fifteen minutes of fame.

1068
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And it ends up being a happy ending of sorts.

1069
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Actually, I think that Queen Semia in chat is right.

1070
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Keyboard Cat is copyrighted or trademarked.

1071
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Yes.

1072
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Because, well, the guy, actually, I remember watching an interview where he licensed out his cat's likeness for the pistachio commercial.

1073
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Right. But the cat in Scribblenauts doesn't really look like it like Nyan Cat does.

1074
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It can be considered enough derivative, but I think copyright law is, what, fifty percent change?

1075
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Yeah, I think, I think that would be the harder one to prove.

1076
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Well, and also the fact that you sum it by typing Keyboard Cat.

1077
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You know, that's true. Or Nyan Cat.

1078
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
But one could argue, well, it is a cat at the keyboard. I don't know.

1079
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It is a cat that's Nyan.

1080
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I still want my body is ready to be in there.

1081
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
That's not a noun. Reggie Fils-Aime could be in there in the Nintendo version.

1082
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I bet if you type that in, the only thing that happens is his jaw comes out.

1083
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
The game just punches you in the face. That's what happens.

1084
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Or starts printing money.

1085
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, 4chan the game. Ain't nobody got time for that.

1086
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I thought that's what Scribblenauts kind of like was, was its big selling point. Was that it had all these memes in it.

1087
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Oh, those stupid guys that were sitting behind us at the baseball game. They're like, foul ball. Ain't nobody got time for that.

1088
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I about laughed my ass off, but I was, I was actually thinking of you doing your impression.

1089
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Honey Brown. What's her name? Honey Brown or whatever her name is. She'd go sue those guys.

1090
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Yeah. All right.

1091
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And yes, you get ceiling cat.

1092
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Yes, ceiling cat's there.

1093
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
The ceiling cat isn't trademarked.

1094
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Grumpy cat. I bet is.

1095
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Grumpy cat is.

1096
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
So he better not show up in the next Scribblenauts.

1097
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
We all loved Tard.

1098
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,000
All right. I'm sure a lot of you guys heard about this next story. It was making the rounds everywhere. It's, it's kind of lolsy.

1099
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
It's about the game Game Dev Tycoon. No relation to the game dev story.

1100
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:53,000
But Game Dev Tycoon came out this past week on Windows, Macs and Linux and Green Heart Games, the folks behind it.

1101
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,000
And they did this interesting thing to kind of combat piracy, which I guess was some type of experiment or whatever.

1102
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And what they did is they put up a copy of the game on one of the big torrent sites and with a little info file that you'd see with most cracked games.

1103
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
That says, you know, fully cracked, playable, dah, dah, dah.

1104
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,000
But in an old throwback to, let's say, the Earthbound pirate copies of many years ago, it would change the game significantly to make it unbeatable.

1105
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
How does it change the game?

1106
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Well, at some point, piracy starts taking over your game development office.

1107
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You'll get a little message that pops up on the screen that says,

1108
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Boss, it seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally.

1109
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
If players don't buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.

1110
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You have to click on a little frown to continue. You can't beat the game at this point.

1111
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And of course it has all these people posting on internet forums about it.

1112
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Like, how do I get the piracy to stop in the game? Which is just giving away how many people were pirating it.

1113
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Very similar as well to, didn't they do this with Arkham Asylum? Not City, but Asylum.

1114
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
They had, like, a whole thing where Batman couldn't make a certain jump.

1115
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And people were posting on forums about this, and WB just went ban, ban, ban, ban.

1116
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Because these were all the people, yeah, that were pirating it.

1117
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Anyway, this guy was collecting anonymous usage statistics and found that it was, what, over 90% of the copies of this being played were pirated.

1118
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Crazy.

1119
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:31,000
But, were those people going to actually play the game legitimately in the first place, or did they just find it when they were browsing new games that are added to the Pirate Bay?

1120
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Because he put it out there himself, you know, on the Pirate Bay, and people were downloading it.

1121
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And let's not forget that other indie companies have put out their game on the Pirate Bay to drive up interest in the game and to, you know, get people to test the game out.

1122
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:03,000
So, that's my thing is, I wonder, I'm not saying that someone confused that for this, I'm sure that people are just pirating, but you can't attribute, if you didn't do that, would your game really be pirated that fast?

1123
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And would it, you still have the same, you know, statistics, I guess. That's my thing.

1124
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
So, if anything, the whole reason behind this is now, it's just for the controversy.

1125
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Because, now it got picked up by all these websites, and now all these people are writing stories about it.

1126
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Well, okay.

1127
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And now he has a legit version out there, and now everyone's like, oh, we gotta support the indies, let's go buy this game, even though, you know, you may or may not want to play it.

1128
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Well, either way, okay, either way you slice this pie low-key, whether you want to say it was the piracy mechanism or the exposure, genius, genius move.

1129
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
No matter which way you slice it, whatever angle they were, either it was a genius anti-piracy scheme or it was a genius marketing scheme.

1130
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:48,000
But it's not very, it's not very honest in the fact that, you know, basically they're, it's kind of like, I would say, like entrapment almost.

1131
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:56,000
The irony of you saying entrapping pirates is not very honest. The irony, it hurts, it's burning.

1132
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Well, there's a-

1133
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I need ice cubes.

1134
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I feel less, I feel less sorry about a company that puts their game up there by themselves versus a game getting leaked to the internet.

1135
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
What were you gonna say, Jamie? Sorry, I had to make my point.

1136
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Breakman was saying using Pirate Bay as your game testers.

1137
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It does end up being kind of like a demo of sorts.

1138
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I mean, cool, you know, cool that people are checking out their game.

1139
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'm sure that's what they want in the end and hopefully it works out for them.

1140
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Yeah.

1141
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I personally am not going to pick up this game. It may have been, you know, the fact that it's compared to Game Dev Story, it's a little similar to that.

1142
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Might be intriguing, but after what they did, fuck them. I'm not buying it. I'm not playing it either.

1143
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
So you are personally offended by this little move?

1144
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I just think it's shady. It's so shady. There's, like, there's a difference between, like, putting-

1145
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
But the Pirate Bay is shady!

1146
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:03,000
No, no, no, hold on. There's a difference between putting something in your game, you know, like Scribbl- not Scribblats, but like the Michael Jackson game on 3DS, or on DS, or-

1147
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh, the Vuvuzela thing. Somebody just brought that up in chat.

1148
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Or, like, the Batman stuff, programming a little thing in there to catch pirates when the game gets leaked out.

1149
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Okay, that's something. That's kind of cool that they've got that in there and you can catch people doing it.

1150
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But the fact that you go, oh, we're gonna show these pirates, we're gonna upload a real co- I mean, come on, that's stupid.

1151
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:29,000
It's like saying, oh, I'm gonna open up my house and I'm gonna say, hey, come steal my shit, and then get pissed off that people are stealing my shit.

1152
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I'm sorry, that's just stupid. It's stupid. And you think you're gonna teach these people moral?

1153
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It's one of those things, like, to say that this is gonna work in the game, people will buy your game, it's just like those stupid advertisements before they-

1154
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Think about the lighting rig, people! They're out of jobs because you pirate your movies!

1155
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I'm sorry, it's just stupid.

1156
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Okay, let's say we're about ready to put out a CD of exclusive Orange Lounge Radio material and things that, you know, never before heard on the show,

1157
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
and that's how we're gonna pay for our hosting for the next year. Hypothetical situation.

1158
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:10,000
How do I make sure that that CD does not get pirated without possibly offending the pirates out there in the world?

1159
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:16,000
You can't. It's music, you're not gonna be able to. There's no DRM that you can put on that.

1160
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:25,000
So, bend over and take it. And enjoy it. Put it out there for free yourself and just hope they'll rally behind you because you're one of them.

1161
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Most likely, here's the thing, the situation with that is, you're not gonna have a whole lot of interest of people putting it up.

1162
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:39,000
They're not gonna leak it out there because they just don't- they figure that, you know, if there's no interest in trying to get the game,

1163
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
they're not gonna necessarily put it out there or, you know, the content.

1164
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:51,000
So, for example, I can't find copies of maybe somebody VHS, you know, recording episodes of Being Bobby Brown.

1165
01:09:51,000 --> 01:10:00,000
That's just not on the internet at all. My wife is wanting me to search high and low and I will till, you know, the day I die to find copies of that.

1166
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
But it's just not up there.

1167
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:07,000
For Being Bobby Brown, I will endorse piracy because everybody has to see that, Bobby!

1168
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It's fantastic but, you know, Whitney was a bitch and she fucking took all- you know, had her lawyers take all that shit down.

1169
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Babe in total control of herself.

1170
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Exactly. And she, you know, had everybody, you know, take, you know, the copies off the internet.

1171
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Not necessarily, just like a lot of the clips too are just gone.

1172
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,000
So, unfortunately, you know, there's that but I just don't think anyone would pirate our CD.

1173
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I mean, sure, they could leak it out there but is anyone really gonna care to download it?

1174
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Okay. So when it comes to- maybe my example about music was a bad one.

1175
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:45,000
But when it comes to games, you had Tim here on the show last night whose job is in the industry making games like Tomb Raider.

1176
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:54,000
What is an effective DRM strategy that we can do to make sure that as many games as possible sell legitimately so people like Tim can continue to be employed?

1177
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Free to play. Because you basically-

1178
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Everything's gotta go free to play.

1179
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Everything's gotta go free to play.

1180
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:08,000
And I'm not saying free to play to the point of, you know, it doesn't even have to necessarily be free to play, like cheap to play I guess.

1181
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
You know, like $10 games with a ton of DLC.

1182
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:17,000
DLC that makes sense, not just, oh you're out of energy points, you gotta buy some DLC to be able to play this game longer.

1183
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Not anything retarded like that but actually supported DLC.

1184
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I mean, granted the game might be shorter because it's more of a demo but that's- what I'm saying is basically you get a small amount of content.

1185
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
For example, Ridge Racer for the Vita would have worked perfectly like that except they charged $40 for it.

1186
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Or $30 for four tracks. It's ridiculous.

1187
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
If they put it out for like five bucks or ten- probably like five bucks would be perfect.

1188
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Okay, Bobby's retort in chat, it's a fair one, I gotta put it out there. This was an $8 game and it was still pirated.

1189
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
It's still a game.

1190
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:56,000
But yeah, I understand that. It may be an $8 game but once again, they put it out there first, they put it out there.

1191
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Would an $8 game-

1192
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Shots fired!

1193
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Would an $8 game be leaked that quickly?

1194
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
That's the question. How quickly would an $8 indie game be leaked out to the internet?

1195
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
There's people who leak games just because they can.

1196
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I understand that they can leak games but if there's DRM on, I mean, I'm assuming it's DRM free but let's assume that there was DRM on it.

1197
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Would really someone spend the time to crack this game and put it out there?

1198
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I mean, sure, there's probably somebody out there that would do it.

1199
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
But I don't know if it's gonna have as big of a draw once now it's all controversial.

1200
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I would actually agree with you to an extent that we have to find a way to get the price of games down.

1201
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And I realize cartridges used to cost 70 bucks and the price we're paying for games now is actually cheaper than they used to be with inflation.

1202
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,000
But with everything else going on in the world, I honestly think we have to find a way to get the price of games down to like 30 or 40 bucks.

1203
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Because when do people these days buy most of their PC games?

1204
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Steam, sales, when everything gets super cheap, you know?

1205
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I love Steam so much.

1206
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I think that's the thing and you gotta find that balance between how much do I charge for it and make sure enough people buy it so that I recoup my costs.

1207
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
But Steam's also a double-edged sword too because now there's games that come out on PC.

1208
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I might think of buying Bioshock Infinite on PC as well as on 360.

1209
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Because I already have the 360 version but I may buy it on PC.

1210
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
But am I gonna pay full price for it? Fuck no!

1211
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I'm gonna wait for a sale because they have sales all the damn time on Steam, on Amazon, on Green Man Gaming, on Gamefly with Steam DRM, on wherever.

1212
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
You're gonna find these games marked down to like nothing.

1213
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And that's the kind of mentality.

1214
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I mean, lookit, Tomb Raider is just half-priced.

1215
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
That game out like two months ago? A month ago?

1216
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I mean, shit, you can't do this with console games.

1217
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
They're not dropping that fast.

1218
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
They're not gonna be five bucks one day and then the next day...

1219
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Well, some do.

1220
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Well, some do, but I'm talking about Tomb Raider, a game that sold quite a bit.

1221
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And it's totally not a disappointment to anybody.

1222
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Gameguru in chat says,

1223
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Well, I believe DRM is rather stupid. What the game dev tycoon guys did was actually pretty clever.

1224
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Breakman says,

1225
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Dev equal, I'll give you $20 to go buy this $10 game. Loki equal, fuck that. Then I'll have to go out of my way. I'm just gonna pirate it.

1226
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I don't pirate games anymore.

1227
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I mean, I don't pirate games to play them early and then buy the game.

1228
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
But you don't pirate them any less?

1229
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Yes, I don't pirate them any less.

1230
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
No, I don't pirate PC games anymore, for sure.

1231
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Maybe to play them a little early, yes, but I do buy them always.

1232
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
But never to just play them because I don't want...

1233
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Because it's so easy now with Steam. It's like a few bucks and you got a game.

1234
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It becomes too convenient.

1235
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Piracy versus convenience. Is piracy more convenient? No.

1236
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But if a game gets leaked out that's supposed to be out in a couple months and I can play it way early,

1237
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I'm all about playing games as soon as I can.

1238
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,000
If Grand Theft Auto 5 gets leaked out tomorrow, you better believe I'm gonna find a way to get it.

1239
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
But you better believe I'm gonna be buying it when it comes out.

1240
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I do believe developers, if they really want to protect their property, need to figure...

1241
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
A. Global releases for everything because that's just the world we live in.

1242
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And B. You need to cut down this window or figure out a way.

1243
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,000
If these review copies that go out, I think review copies ought to have the DRM in them and the stringent stuff.

1244
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
What's the deal? They're free to the people.

1245
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
We need to make sure that these review copies don't get out into the wild because that's what ruins all the day one sales.

1246
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
That's the gap they've got to close.

1247
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,000
It's not even really review copies because of the whole Far Cry 3, Blood Dragon, or whatever.

1248
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
That was a hack on Uplay.

1249
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
But there are some other stuff that gets leaked out from duplicators or games.

1250
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,000
They go to retail early because they street date stuff and they get shipped to the retailer a week early.

1251
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So then that gets leaked out by some employee.

1252
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:19,000
But then there's like the Microsoft games that come out a month ahead time and I'm assuming that's duplicators because I can't see how the hell it could leak any earlier than that.

1253
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Alright, I'm sure we'll get some emails on this at a later date.

1254
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
OrangeOnsRadio, excuse me, mailbag at OrangeOnsRadio.com.

1255
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I do actually want to say there's been a couple cases where I've downloaded PC games through a torrent site because the servers were down for the actual site.

1256
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And I had a key to play it. Just saying.

1257
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Sometimes, especially if you play Ragnarok online, sometimes it's the only way to get it.

1258
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Alright, let's move on with more news. We're running long, so DarkSakura.

1259
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Alright, let me get it.

1260
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Now, there is, for people who are fans of Eternal Darkness, there is a spiritual successor called Shadow of the Eternals that's been announced.

1261
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:13,000
In fact, there's already a bunch of information out on it saying that it's going to be out on PC and Wii U and that they are trying to score 1.5 million to fund the game.

1262
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I'm sure it's going to be interesting. What I'm not seeing is if it's a Kickstarter or not out yet for that.

1263
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:33,000
But they are wanting to have this, do it episodic and have it out by Q3 2014.

1264
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Cool.

1265
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Some people I know on Twitter are not big fans of this idea. I mean, as much as Eternal Darkness was awesome, apparently the guy who made it, Dennis Dyack, hasn't made a lot of winners.

1266
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
So they're not sure if this is something worth supporting. But he'll get the money.

1267
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Well, it looks like it's going to be produced through Precursor Games. So, Canadian group. Good games are coming out of Canada.

1268
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming a little bit sooner than things that are getting Kickstarted right now.

1269
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Loki, start us off with US.

1270
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
There's nothing coming up this week. Seriously, nothing.

1271
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Really? Nothing. Not a damn thing?

1272
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Nothing until the 14th and 14th would be Metro 20, not 23, Metro Last Light on the 14th.

1273
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Why is that? Is that just because it's a slow time of year? They figure everybody is seeing Iron Man.

1274
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:40,000
It's a slow time of the year, usually. There's still quite a few releases coming out, but I think we're getting that pre-console launch lull.

1275
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And so we don't have a lot of games coming out. There was supposed to be the Wii U version of Deus Ex Human Revolution, but that is now TVA.

1276
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:57,000
So, no idea what's going on there. They've delayed it or if they're canceling development on it or what.

1277
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Very interesting. Well, going over to Japan and looking at the releases there, guess what? There is nothing coming out in Japan either.

1278
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Actually, one game. One game on the Sony PSP. PSP game still selling. Kudwafter, Converted Edition. I think we talked about this last week.

1279
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Kudwafter!

1280
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Yeah, we had nothing last week either, so I think we already talked about this game, but it's a very, very slow period in Japan right now.

1281
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,000
But Dark Sakura, you were talking a little bit earlier about the whole holidays in Japan and Gold Week.

1282
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Golden Week was this past week and Children's Week is this week.

1283
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
So this is likely having an impact on all these releases.

1284
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Well, I mean, Golden Week is actually, from what I understand, kind of hard to sell anything because nobody's there.

1285
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Golden Week is when you go home to visit your family, so this week would be, I think, a lot busier for sales.

1286
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

1287
01:19:46,000 --> 01:20:02,000
We have a very few things in the UK. On the 9th, we have Sid Meier's Ace Patrol and the 10th Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut for Wii U and Persona 4 The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1288
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So I'm sure our buddy Magi is very happy about that, as he told me earlier that he was happy.

1289
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Because he said after he wrote us that letter that he found out it was coming out.

1290
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Nice.

1291
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And the new Shin Megami Tensei.

1292
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Very cool.

1293
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.

1294
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Apparently there's another lawsuit going on now against EA for their Madden franchise.

1295
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Apparently this was from a guy named Robin Antonic and he was the designer of John Madden Football for 8-bit computers.

1296
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And it's actually going to trial.

1297
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And apparently, I guess, he's seeking cuts from all of the games sold so far because they've used a lot of the design that was in his game.

1298
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And they've just failed to compensate him or even credit him. In fact, actually...

1299
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Madden 25 out this year, right? 25 years. 25 sequels to Madden.

1300
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yes. And they've actually, I mean, there was on one of the boxes credits him for the Madden games.

1301
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And now it's just, you know, nothing. No sort of royalties or anything. Even though he was a co-creator of the series.

1302
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I don't know. It sounds like he has a pretty strong case. It'll be interesting to see if he can settle out of court or not.

1303
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Of course it will. They always...

1304
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
It says it's going to trial, so we never know.

1305
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Just because it goes to trial. First day of the trial. Oh, he reached an agreement. Go figure.

1306
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:39,000
That happened to me once when I was on jury duty. We were sitting in the little hallway waiting to go in the room.

1307
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I didn't even know what the case was about. I didn't know if it was criminal, civil, what.

1308
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
We're sitting in the hallway waiting to go in the room and then we're sitting there for like an hour, an hour and a half.

1309
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,000
They come out and say, oh, they just settled, so we're going to have you guys all go back to the jury room.

1310
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Yeah, I've had that happen before today.

1311
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Like, okay. It's a game of chicken. How far are we going to go? Are we actually going to get the jury in here?

1312
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Man, jury duty is great. It's like your chance to sit and read a book.

1313
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Yeah, jury duty is not so bad. Maybe it's just this particular county, because here in Sacramento it's just one day or one trial.

1314
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And they actually have really decent snacks in the cafeteria.

1315
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And that's super important.

1316
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I've actually, I made a friend that was in our wow guild because we were both on jury duty.

1317
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And we're sitting in the hallway freaking talking about our draenei and how we were looking forward to seeing what the new expansion was.

1318
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
And we were all so disappointed. But yeah.

1319
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:43,000
The last time I was on jury duty, I was playing, I want to say it was Final Fantasy IV, the after years, but wasn't that only on Wii at the time?

1320
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Yes. So it must have just been Final Fantasy IV. Maybe that's when the DS cartridge came out. I bet that's what it was.

1321
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And I was playing the crap out of that for jury duty.

1322
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I just remember being so bored sitting at home. No, it wasn't because I was actually working at that other place.

1323
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
But I went in for my jury duty and it gave me a chance to read my book and get my stuff done.

1324
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:09,000
And I sadly didn't get picked for a jury because I kind of wanted to be on one so I could have the people's court thing going in my head.

1325
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I sat on one in 2006. It was terrible.

1326
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I want a nice, long murder trial.

1327
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
No, you don't. Be careful what you wish for.

1328
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Because I was on a two week trial for a criminal case that was bad. It wasn't murder, but it was very, very, very bad stuff.

1329
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And it's like one of those, I'm glad I got to do my civic duty. I'm glad I got to see Law and Order play out in front of me.

1330
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Because the very animated prosecutor was awesome to watch. She was great.

1331
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But I never want to be on a trial like that again in my life.

1332
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,000
But I actually don't mind the waiting for it just because it gives me a chance to read.

1333
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Alright, anyhow. How do we get on jury duty?

1334
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Well, it must be, it's like...

1335
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Video games and jury duty.

1336
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Well, it's legal week here on OLR because guess what my story is about?

1337
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Another lawsuit.

1338
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And this is one of those, oh, we must have seen this coming after all the internet rage about Mass Effect 3.

1339
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I remember when somebody tried to sue there.

1340
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Well, guess what game got targeted this time?

1341
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Aliens Colonial Marines.

1342
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
That's right. Sega and Gearbox.

1343
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Class action lawsuit against them saying you knowingly misrepresented Aliens Colonial Marines at trade show demos.

1344
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Fascinating.

1345
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And a lot of people were bitching about this too.

1346
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Like the game that came out did not match what they were showing at E3 and all this.

1347
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
So, but I don't know.

1348
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Like can you sue a movie because the movie wasn't as good as the trailer?

1349
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
And they put stuff in the trailer all the time that doesn't end up in the real movie.

1350
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I don't know though.

1351
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Well, you know, I would like, you know, the two hours of my life back for Mortal Kombat resurrection or whatever the crap it was.

1352
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
And I totally blame Jessica and Ross for making me watch that. Actually, I blame Ross for making me watch that movie.

1353
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:56,000
But I didn't go demand, you know, that people give me money or anything for a shitty movie.

1354
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I mean, I pretty much knew it was shit anyway.

1355
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
But the trailers made it look a lot more interesting than it actually was.

1356
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
And it was the sequel to the first one.

1357
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
It was actually really boring and stupid.

1358
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Alright, anyhow, Timegate Studios, maybe they can see this coming, the end is coming.

1359
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Because, of course, they are the developer behind Aliens Colonial Marines co-developer.

1360
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And they also developed a game called Section 8.

1361
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,000
They filed for bankruptcy protection at the Texas Southern Bankruptcy Court.

1362
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Apparently, owing their creditors between $10 and $50 million in debt.

1363
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
That's a hell of a price range. That's a very odd estimate.

1364
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
But, yeah, Timegate seeking protection against creditors.

1365
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Now, granted, they aren't the target of this lawsuit per se.

1366
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:46,000
But, yeah, don't release a game as bad as Aliens Colonial Marines, people.

1367
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Because in this day and age, you'll get sued over it.

1368
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
How dare you waste my time?

1369
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Then again, $60 for a game. It's a big chunk of change.

1370
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And also, they had, you know, all the media that was from it was from the, you know, pre-release thing.

1371
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
So, there was nothing like ads development goes.

1372
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Oh, hey, yeah, we had to scale back this up because it wouldn't run on a console.

1373
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Alright, well, let's travel to a time when things were a lot simpler.

1374
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
To the intro of our show.

1375
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
We got a new theme back in the day. Thank you.

1376
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
When we first started the show this evening, before we started...

1377
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Long, long time ago. A couple hours.

1378
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Back then, we weren't talking about Final Fuck X.

1379
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
We were just talking about, you know, blowjobs. I don't know.

1380
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1381
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:45,000
You know, back in the day, you would buy a game like, I don't know, what was it?

1382
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
ET.

1383
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
What was a really terrible game?

1384
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Okay, ET. And you know what? You just got stuck with it.

1385
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
There was no class action lawsuit because ET sucked.

1386
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Alright, DarkSakura, go into the gaming vault and find a game that, hey, the kids should be playing this week.

1387
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
What is the classic game of the week?

1388
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
The classic game of the week is Magical Chase for the PC Engine.

1389
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Also known as the TurboGrafx.

1390
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I will tell you right now that this is one of the holy grails of the U.S. Turbo graphics games.

1391
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Because they did like five copies in the U.S.

1392
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I actually, I don't even, I would like a copy of this because it's actually a really neat little game.

1393
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Magical Chase was put out by Palsoft and released by Quest on the PC Engine.

1394
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Came out in 1991 in Japan and 1993 in the U.S.

1395
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
And you play as a little witch named Ripple who flies on a broomstick.

1396
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I swear I used to get this confused with cotton back in the day for the record.

1397
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
But you have...

1398
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It reminds me of cotton. I was going to ask if it was in that same series.

1399
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
No, it's not. Compile, I think, did cotton, didn't it?

1400
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Yeah.

1401
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Anyway, you have these little stars with you called Star Maidens and they act as your options like Ingradius.

1402
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:11,000
And that's funny, the article even compares to cotton. Success did cotton, not compile.

1403
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:18,000
But it was one of the last games that was released in the U.S. for the TurboGrafx, Turbo Duo.

1404
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And had a ton of hype and now it's like you'd be hard pressed to find a copy.

1405
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:30,000
So as you play through the game, you have normal and hard difficulty settings.

1406
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
You can only play the first three levels on easy.

1407
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Once your enemies are destroyed, they leave gemstones behind.

1408
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:46,000
So that's your currency in games. You can buy power-ups, health, extra lives.

1409
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Except on the third six levels, it only appears once.

1410
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Touching stuff on the ground does not kill you, but it does slow you down.

1411
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And if you get trapped behind objects, you get scrolling damage.

1412
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:14,000
You have your different levels. You have Cubolagon, Dodon Grin, Kamikaze Dangan, Fat Metal, which just sounds funny, Gemini Snow, and then the Sixth Seal.

1413
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So there are other ports. They did a version for Windows 95, 98 that came out in 1998.

1414
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And then they did Magical Chase GB for the Game Boy Color, only in Japan on August 4th, 2000.

1415
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:39,000
And like I said, it's rare. In fact, I was about to eBay it just to see exactly if there's any copies on eBay right now.

1416
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
So let's find out.

1417
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,000
And honestly, it's a cute little game. I like that level because it looks like she's flying over Tetris blocks.

1418
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
It does, yeah. This is a cute little...

1419
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
It's just the beginning of the game, too.

1420
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Very cartoony game. I like this.

1421
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Kind of Fantasy Zone, in a way. The art style.

1422
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
It's just really cute. Yeah.

1423
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Well, Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier were both set in the same universe.

1424
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
So let's see. Magical Chase.

1425
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Why are you trying to autocorrect me to Chase?

1426
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Why don't you keep reading and I'll look it up real quick?

1427
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Well, I got it right now.

1428
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Okay, I don't want the dead air.

1429
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Anyway, Magical Chase PC Engine, the Japanese version, $229.80.

1430
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Yeah, okay. Super Rare NEC PC Engine Q card.

1431
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:36,000
This is still the Japanese version. $249.00. $199.00.

1432
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Even the Game Boy Color version is going for $249.00.

1433
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Dang.

1434
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
This is another Japanese...

1435
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Okay, we have the soundtrack for $50.00.

1436
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
So yeah, Magical Chase, even the Japanese versions are going for quite a bit of money.

1437
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
The soundtracks are going for money.

1438
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Basically, anything related to Magical Chase is fetching some money.

1439
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
So, good luck.

1440
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
If someone happens to find me a Magical Chase, give it to me.

1441
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Alright.

1442
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
But yeah, I'd say if any of you happen to have the game,

1443
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
you've got a celebrity, a small internet celebrity,

1444
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
who would make puppy eyes at you until you give it to her.

1445
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Or panorama cotton. Those are like on my list.

1446
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Although, to be honest, if I saw this and then I saw Radiant Silver Gun

1447
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
right next to it to get for Dan,

1448
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I think that I would do the right thing and get this for myself.

1449
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Good answer. Very good answer.

1450
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Actually, I don't think Dan would follow me.

1451
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Alright.

1452
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Magical Chase, no relation to cotton.

1453
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
But a small resemblance to Fantasy Zone.

1454
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
But she doesn't go, wheel-o!

1455
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Alright. Good pick. I knew nothing about this game,

1456
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
and now I'm looking at it going, gosh, I want to play this.

1457
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Too bad I'll have to emulate it.

1458
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
You can get, it is out there too.

1459
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Of course it is. Of course it is.

1460
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And I would not blame a single soul for downloading the game,

1461
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
just saying. In my, allegedly.

1462
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
You know, a game that's this hard to find, that's this old,

1463
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I mean, who could really fault you for it?

1464
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
If it was on virtual console or something, we'd say go get it.

1465
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
You better believe I have an emulated copy of panorama cotton

1466
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
since they made 600 total in the world, so.

1467
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week segment.

1468
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
We're gonna take a break. When we come back,

1469
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
plenty of more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1470
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Xbox rumors, yippee yay.

1471
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
We only have a few more weeks to sit through those.

1472
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Also talking about some free-to-play stuff on Wii U.

1473
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Call of Duty, yes. And plenty more.

1474
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Your calls and the Fugu Question of the Week,

1475
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
all about pinball tonight. Duty.

1476
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,

1477
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
right after this.

1478
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1479
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Live on this Cinco de Mayo, May 5th, 2013,

1480
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
with episode 503 of our show already in progress.

1481
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
And if you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network,

1482
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
vognetwork.com, you missed some pretty lively debates

1483
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
in the first half of the show, so we hope you will check that out

1484
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
in the podcast feed.

1485
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I also have to give apologies here at the start of this segment

1486
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
to our friends over at Anime Jam Session.

1487
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
They put on a lovely show, which is on Tuesday nights

1488
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
at the Voice of Geeks Network,

1489
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
and it's 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern,

1490
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
and they rebroadcast Thursday mornings.

1491
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
They sent us a bumper for the 500th episode

1492
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
that I still haven't played,

1493
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
because I was trying to sync it to music a couple weeks ago,

1494
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
and I literally ran out of time because it wasn't working,

1495
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
and I just forgot to do it today.

1496
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And I've also been procrastinating it because

1497
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
nobody else except Flaco sent us a bumper.

1498
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
So please take a look at the post in our forums

1499
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
and send us more bumpers,

1500
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
and then I'll have reasons to play them all.

1501
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
But I also want to give a shout-out to our pals over there

1502
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
at Anime Jam Session, because

1503
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I got a lovely package in the mail,

1504
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
a mail package,

1505
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
from Rama this week

1506
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
that sent us some cards.

1507
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Was it stuffed? Yes, it was stuffed

1508
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
with these Cards Against Humanity boosters

1509
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
from PAX East.

1510
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
So these are going to be pretty hard to come by in California,

1511
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
or many parts of the nation.

1512
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
So, awesome.

1513
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
We kept one or two for ourselves,

1514
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
but we are going to be looking to give away

1515
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
these Pack A and Cs

1516
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
that we got. Sadly no Bs, but hey,

1517
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
you know what? Bakers can't be choosers.

1518
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
So some of these Pack As and Cs we're going to give to you guys,

1519
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
the listeners, in coming weeks of the show.

1520
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
And maybe if there's like a live event

1521
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
coming up, like Fanime or something,

1522
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I'll take some of these with me to that,

1523
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
and you can win them from me there too.

1524
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
So yeah,

1525
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
thank you very much to our pals over there.

1526
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I think Brad's first in line now.

1527
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Wow, what did Brad say?

1528
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Oh, I sent you guys booze, what else do you want?

1529
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Yeah, Brad,

1530
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
you make a good case.

1531
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I guess I should be sending him some Cards Against Humanity

1532
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
cards for sure.

1533
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
We trade goods amongst the Voice

1534
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
of Geeks network shows. The bartering system.

1535
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Yeah, bartering system. You give me booze,

1536
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I give you cards.

1537
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I didn't give Anime Jam Session anything yet,

1538
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
but I will...

1539
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Rama has my heart.

1540
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
That's what they have.

1541
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Alright.

1542
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
To register participation for this

1543
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

1544
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
on Vognetwork.com, use the pass

1545
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
phrase, FLAG.

1546
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Anyhow, let us get back

1547
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
into some gaming news. Rapid Fire

1548
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
news for this Part B. Loki.

1549
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Borderlands has, well, originally

1550
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
it kind of leaked out from a

1551
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
picture, but it has

1552
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
now been officially announced. Tiny

1553
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep

1554
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
is going to be the next piece of DLC,

1555
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
or I should say the last

1556
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
piece or fourth piece of the game's

1557
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
season pass. Did they make her politically correct yet?

1558
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
No. So it's sort of

1559
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
a play on Dungeons and Dragons

1560
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
and, you know,

1561
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
it'll be interesting. So that's

1562
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
supposed to be coming out June 25th.

1563
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
It will be included in the season

1564
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
pass, so if you have that. Otherwise, it's

1565
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
ten bucks.

1566
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
There's a new game console

1567
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
trailer this week.

1568
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
It's not even really a game console as much

1569
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
as it's more of like an analog

1570
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
video game synthesizer. It's a

1571
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
thing called Ming Meka

1572
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
and it's really

1573
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
strange. I mean, it works just like a synthesizer

1574
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
so it has a lot of analog,

1575
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
you know, physical cords that you're

1576
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
plugging into the stuff and, you know, dials

1577
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
you're tweaking and that sort of thing.

1578
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
And it kind of, it makes

1579
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
music, like a synthesizer, and also

1580
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
kind of does an interactive display.

1581
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Like, you could do games and

1582
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
stuff sort of on it. Very basic

1583
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
glitchy looking things.

1584
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I see this more as like

1585
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
something that you would see with like chiptune

1586
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
artists or something like that kind of messing around

1587
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
with, you know, in like a live performance

1588
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
type setting because it

1589
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
seems like that would, you know,

1590
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
play well to it. Plus, it is open

1591
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
source, so you

1592
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
can actually, you know, build one

1593
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
yourself if you want.

1594
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Or they're going to be selling it. They said they

1595
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
estimate the console is going to be

1596
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
anywhere from, you know,

1597
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
um, you know,

1598
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
was it $350 for the control core

1599
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
or $1,000 for the world core?

1600
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Because it's a few, I mean,

1601
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
we're talking like it is a synthesizer, so

1602
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
it's kind of in the realm of that.

1603
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
It makes sense price-wise. As a video game

1604
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
console, not so much. But it does get

1605
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
controlled partially within the NES controller, so

1606
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
it looks interesting.

1607
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Um,

1608
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
and last but not least, the

1609
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
kick-started project, or it was

1610
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
attempted to be kick-started, but it kind of failed.

1611
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Um, Project Awakened

1612
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
has now, um,

1613
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
put itself on hold, I guess,

1614
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
due to alternate funding

1615
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
options and donors

1616
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
are now receiving refunds. In other words,

1617
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
somebody is picking this thing

1618
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
up and will probably publish it.

1619
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
So, that's kind of cool.

1620
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Because it looks kind of interesting.

1621
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
One of the first Unreal 4 games

1622
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
that's kind of like a first person,

1623
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
or a third person

1624
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
superhero action

1625
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
game. So, could be neat.

1626
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Alright.

1627
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Going over to some news from Level 5.

1628
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
You know Level 5, they made Ni No Kuni,

1629
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
was one of their more recent developing games.

1630
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Dragon Quest 8, of course, you know, they've done

1631
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
a lot of games. White Knight Chronicles.

1632
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Well, they have some trademarks

1633
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
out there that have been filed. It's

1634
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
reported that they have filed trademarks for

1635
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Rare Drop Adventure Note,

1636
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Earth Devastating

1637
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
B-Rank Girlfriend.

1638
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
That's what it's called.

1639
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
That's an awesome title.

1640
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
And Wonder Flick. That's kind of a neat

1641
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
little sounding thing too. They were all

1642
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
trademarked by the developer all around the same time.

1643
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Who knows what this could be? These could be three

1644
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
titles in one series. These could all be

1645
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
new games in development.

1646
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
They could be Red Herrings. Who knows? They could be

1647
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
anything. But I hope

1648
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
they all sound like neat

1649
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
titles. So, whatever they are, they're pretty kick-ass.

1650
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
But of course, you know, you can't

1651
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
judge a game based off its title. But these are good

1652
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
starts. But we don't know anything else

1653
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
about these. Maybe E3?

1654
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Maybe Tokyo Game Show?

1655
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
It sounds like it might be

1656
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
the third Guild

1657
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
game. They always have these

1658
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
weird kind of indie games that are

1659
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
a prize of that. So, maybe

1660
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
these are titles in that.

1661
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Okay, that's a good theory.

1662
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Also, Nintendo apparently

1663
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
going to be introducing Retro Studio's new

1664
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
project in the not-so-distant

1665
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
future. Could this be

1666
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
E3 or a Nintendo Direct?

1667
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Who knows? But

1668
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Hiro Yamada said, quote,

1669
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I wonder what kind of game it is. I hope

1670
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
to introduce it to you in the not-so-distant

1671
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
future.

1672
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Interesting. That's in an

1673
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
interview with Official Nintendo.

1674
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Well, what? Official Nintendo Magazine. Must be over in

1675
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Japan because they don't have one here anymore.

1676
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
So, I'll tell you what it should be.

1677
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
What? It should be

1678
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
a new Excite Shark game.

1679
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
It's the UK Official Nintendo Magazine.

1680
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
It should be a new Excite Shark game. Is that what you want Retro Studios

1681
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
to be working on? That would sell me a system.

1682
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
A new Excite Truck game. That's good.

1683
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I'm not talking fucking

1684
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Excitebots trick racing.

1685
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Because that was absolute shit.

1686
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I will be tickled pink if

1687
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
it's a new Metroid or a new F-Zero.

1688
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Especially a new F-Zero.

1689
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
That would be pretty cool. I mean, at least that's a

1690
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
racing game, Loki. You gotta get excited about that a little bit.

1691
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Come on. HD.

1692
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Super fast. Alright. Anyhow.

1693
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Also, this may or may not be

1694
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
something up Dark Sakura's alley. I don't know if she's really

1695
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
into this series anymore. I don't have any alleys.

1696
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
The Sims 4.

1697
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Oh, you're not so much a Sims

1698
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
girl anymore? If it

1699
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
manages memory better and lets me get in more

1700
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
fun mods, then

1701
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
yeah, but Sims 3 played like shit.

1702
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Well, Sims

1703
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Is it online only? Well,

1704
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
the rumor is, yes it is.

1705
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
But what, I mean, of course

1706
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
that rumor's gonna be out there after what happened with

1707
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
SimCity. It will be very interesting to see how

1708
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
what happened with SimCity plays into this.

1709
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Regardless, we all know it's gotta happen

1710
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
eventually, but it looks like it's something that could be

1711
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
happening relatively soon. They are

1712
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
saying this could actually be announced tomorrow,

1713
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
May 6th. So by the time many of you hear

1714
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
this podcast, it could have been announced.

1715
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
This is due to a web domain

1716
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
registration, apparently by EA.

1717
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Which I would have thought you would grab the Sims 4

1718
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
name a hell of a long time ago. Whatever.

1719
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
The studio is holding a conference

1720
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
call tomorrow. Supposed to be making a

1721
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
major announcement. So what the hell else would it be?

1722
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Except maybe five more Sims 3 expansions!

1723
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Yes!

1724
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
They have about that, Maynie.

1725
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
You wanna know what's really sad?

1726
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Is that with Sims 3, the

1727
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
stuff that the mod community's been doing

1728
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
is worlds better

1729
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
than any of the official stuff

1730
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
that EA put out. I mean, even

1731
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
down to custom furniture,

1732
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
everything, the fan community has just been

1733
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
perfect, and I would love for

1734
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
it would actually, I would buy it

1735
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
if they would hire some of the

1736
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
mod people. The people who have done mods. Well, they're not Valve.

1737
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I know, but I'm saying

1738
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
that would sell it for me right there, is

1739
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
certain people in the

1740
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
custom community. You don't want to be always

1741
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
connected? No!

1742
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I hate people.

1743
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Because Sims

1744
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
because Sims Online

1745
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Sims Online worked so well.

1746
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Rob. And also the Sims Social worked so

1747
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
well that they're totally closing

1748
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
that game. Actually, Sims Social was, everybody

1749
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
was fucking playing that. I played Sims

1750
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Social. That came and went.

1751
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Like, I kind of wish Candy Crush Saga would

1752
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
I finally blocked it this week, y'all. I couldn't

1753
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
anymore with Candy Crush. I couldn't. And then

1754
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
what happens last night, I'm lying in bed

1755
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
and I hear this very familiar song and I'm like

1756
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
what are you doing over there on your phone, Alan?

1757
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I'm stuck on level 29

1758
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
in Candy Crush Saga. No!

1759
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
You can't

1760
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
escape. For the record, I don't hate

1761
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
people, just most people.

1762
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
You love

1763
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
all our listeners, right? Yeah.

1764
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Okay, good.

1765
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Yeah, I love you guys.

1766
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
No, seriously.

1767
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I love you guys. Seriously. Seriously.

1768
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Love you, mean it. Seriously. Alright, Dark

1769
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Soccer, what do you got for us? I am not

1770
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Grumpy Cat.

1771
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I'm not Grumpy Cat. I'm

1772
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Disgruntled Cat.

1773
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Anyway, Square

1774
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Enix is remastering

1775
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
soundtracks from Final Fantasy games.

1776
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
We will be seeing the Final Fantasy

1777
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
4 one released

1778
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
on, looks like July 3rd

1779
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
this year.

1780
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
That's the first one they're starting

1781
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
with and they're going to have box art done

1782
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
especially by

1783
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Yoshitaka Amano

1784
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
and then

1785
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
of course we're probably not going to see it in

1786
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
the US, but

1787
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Square Enix does do digital releases

1788
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
for a lot of their albums so we might see it on iTunes.

1789
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
iTunes. Of course,

1790
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
you know, if you actually want a physical CD so that

1791
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
you can get the awesome artwork, there's always CD

1792
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
from Japan.

1793
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Also,

1794
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Break Man, I am not hating your faces.

1795
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Okay, I don't hate anyone's

1796
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
faces.

1797
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Also, we have

1798
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
a notice that there is

1799
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
a DVD out called 100 yen

1800
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
the Japanese Arcade Experience

1801
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
which is a

1802
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
documentary about

1803
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
arcade culture in Japan.

1804
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
There's a trailer for it out if you're

1805
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
interested in looking at it, but

1806
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
not only does it talk about

1807
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
just gaming, arcade

1808
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
gaming in Japan, it does talk about the US

1809
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
and Canada as well, and the

1810
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
casual gamers.

1811
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
So,

1812
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
and last but not least,

1813
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
for people who are pinball

1814
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
fans, like me,

1815
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Pinball FX 2 is coming

1816
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
to Steam. The game

1817
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
itself will be free, but the tables will be

1818
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
10 bucks a pop. 6 pounds

1819
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
for our British listeners.

1820
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
And that's including Star Wars

1821
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Pinball, Marvel Pinball, Marvel Pinball

1822
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Legends of Virtue, Marvel Pinball

1823
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Avengers Chronicles, Pinball FX

1824
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
2 Core Collection, and

1825
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Zen Classics.

1826
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I had a

1827
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
pretty good time playing it. It sort of gave

1828
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
me some of the feel of

1829
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
pinmame, but

1830
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
not

1831
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
quite. They're

1832
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
all original stuff, so it was pretty neat.

1833
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
That's cool. Yeah.

1834
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Alright, so let's move

1835
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
on a little bit to some

1836
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
actual, I

1837
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
don't know,

1838
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Xbox rumors, if you will.

1839
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
This week,

1840
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
it was made known that

1841
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Microsoft has registered

1842
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
the domain for Xbox

1843
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Fusion, and

1844
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
also

1845
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
some other stuff related to XboxFusion.de,

1846
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
XboxFusion.co.uk,

1847
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
XboxFusion.biz.

1848
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
So,

1849
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
one would think, hey,

1850
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
you know, Xbox Fusion, that could be

1851
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
a name of a console, maybe.

1852
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Maybe.

1853
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
So,

1854
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
good chances are that

1855
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
might be actually what they're gonna finally call the

1856
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
console.

1857
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Maybe a little bit better than

1858
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Xbox Lube, I don't know, I mean.

1859
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Unless they're having a

1860
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
service called Fusion.

1861
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
That's true, I guess they could have that

1862
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
as well, but

1863
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
at least there is something that's gonna be

1864
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
kind of relating

1865
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
to the Xbox that's gonna be named Fusion,

1866
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
so we'll see if it's actually the console, or

1867
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
it's not a bad name for a console, I guess.

1868
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
It could work. It just

1869
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
seems like they arbitrarily picked a name out of their

1870
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
asses. Fusion sounds cool,

1871
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
let's call it that.

1872
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Then also, there is

1873
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
a rumor that the next,

1874
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
or the first,

1875
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I guess, debut game of

1876
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Respawn Entertainment is gonna

1877
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
actually be this game

1878
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
called Titan, and

1879
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
some information has kind of

1880
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
leaked out about it already,

1881
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
saying that the game

1882
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
is gonna revolve around

1883
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
these giant mechs,

1884
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
called Titans, and so it's kind of a

1885
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
multiplayer shooter game, but

1886
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
then it's also gonna have these giant mechs as well,

1887
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
kind of think it's a little bit like MechWarrior,

1888
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
but maybe more of the

1889
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
scale of, it kind of reminds me of

1890
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Command & Conquer Generals, and

1891
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
MechWarrior.

1892
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
The Titan thing is really funny, because Blizzard

1893
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
has that Project Titan thing right now.

1894
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
We all know that's not the real name of the game,

1895
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
but it's just funny that

1896
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
there is a game called Titan, maybe.

1897
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
And then,

1898
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
what else?

1899
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
And apparently,

1900
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
this might be exclusive to the next

1901
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
platform. I'm assuming it's gonna be exclusive

1902
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
for a limited amount of time. I don't know if it's gonna be

1903
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
exclusive forever, but probably at launch.

1904
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
And Microsoft's had a few deals like this

1905
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
with the DLC, Windows, and all that.

1906
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Skyrim, right, had that?

1907
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Yeah, Skyrim

1908
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
did. Call of Duty does,

1909
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
and did.

1910
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Grand Theft Auto did.

1911
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Ah, yeah.

1912
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
There's been a lot.

1913
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And then,

1914
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
of course,

1915
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Illumaroom had a new trailer this week,

1916
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
and for those who don't remember,

1917
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Illumaroom is this brand new

1918
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
peripheral that's gonna tie in with the

1919
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Xbox 360, or the new Xbox,

1920
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
and perhaps PCs

1921
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
as well, to kind of

1922
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
extend the play field

1923
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
for your games. And the way it's being

1924
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
done, they actually showed the device this time, so

1925
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
we don't have to imagine what it looks like.

1926
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
It's all very prototype right

1927
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
now, but right now,

1928
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
it's basically a projector

1929
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
attached to a Kinect sensor,

1930
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
and the Kinect sensor scans the room,

1931
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
and so it actually will,

1932
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
you can use it for

1933
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
special effects, you can use it to

1934
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
increase, you know, your

1935
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
field of view, you can also

1936
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
use it for, like,

1937
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
indicators and

1938
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
stuff in the game,

1939
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
and the way it does everything, it actually

1940
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
projects stuff in there and will manipulate,

1941
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
like, you can actually have, like, a ripple

1942
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
effect come out of the screen, and

1943
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
it just looks really cool. But

1944
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
this is something that you

1945
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
were really only gonna see, I guess, a public demo

1946
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
of it as early

1947
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
as July is when they're gonna

1948
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
publicly demo this, and it's not expected

1949
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
to be something that the system launches with if it

1950
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
does eventually. Which might have bummed out some people

1951
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
that were kind of looking forward to something like that.

1952
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
The concept looked really cool.

1953
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I would be worried that if they launched this

1954
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
with the console, which, don't get me wrong, I think

1955
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
if they could get it in the console and have

1956
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
the price of it be cheap enough,

1957
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
because adding a projector,

1958
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
an HD projector, and

1959
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
another Kinect sensor. Yeah, but what if it's

1960
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
not, like, the images itself,

1961
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
if it's just, like, colored lights and things

1962
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
like that that enhance the- But it's actually,

1963
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
it's a project- I mean, it looks neat.

1964
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I mean, it looked neat. Maybe that's what they're still trying to figure

1965
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
out, is the- The problem is, though, is

1966
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
they envision it as, like, a projector

1967
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
that sits on a coffee table. So once again,

1968
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
you're talking

1969
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Kinect sensor- I don't got a coffee table!

1970
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
That's for rich people! Exactly. I don't have a coffee

1971
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
table, I don't have this, you know,

1972
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
you're limiting it now to

1973
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
okay, it's gonna have this, this thing

1974
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
that's gonna sit on a coffee table. Well, hey, hold on a second.

1975
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
If I have to have a coffee

1976
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
table in my room, this projector's gonna sit- Where do I play

1977
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Kinect? Exactly, exactly.

1978
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
But you're telling me to move the coffee table out of the

1979
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
way to play the Kinect games? I'm confused!

1980
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I am not rearranging the goddamn furniture

1981
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
to play Xbox. What do you want me to do with this coffee

1982
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
table? Microsoft

1983
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
unveils the easily movable coffee

1984
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
table. It moves out! It moves back in!

1985
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
It put sensors on it, it put

1986
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
coffee on it! It's great. The Microsoft

1987
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
transformer coffee table, wah wah wah.

1988
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
It's coming to you from IKEA!

1989
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
That would mean you'd

1990
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
have to build it yourself, and it would have a name

1991
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
like Sfarce

1992
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Gardevan. Or Billy.

1993
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Well, that's the bookcase, sorry.

1994
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Alright. There you go, Xbox

1995
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Fusion is the new coffee table.

1996
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
This system

1997
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
is the coffee table.

1998
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
It fuses to your coffee table. It is the

1999
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
coffee table. It becomes one with

2000
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
the coffee table. It hopefully has nothing to do with

2001
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Fusion Frenzy. Let's

2002
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
pray, please. That has nothing to do with

2003
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Fusion Frenzy. Or what if, what if

2004
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
or we could see the headlines now.

2005
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
There's a frenzy for the new Xbox

2006
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Fusion. It's a Fusion Frenzy!

2007
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Break! Ahhhh!

2008
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Break Man in our chatroom at live.hug

2009
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
at live.hugnetwork.com says

2010
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Xbox needs to move the coffee table

2011
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
its damn self.

2012
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
That's really hilarious. Setting up

2013
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
room for Kinect.

2014
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
It just

2015
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
knocks over your coffee table.

2016
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
It disappears into the floor

2017
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
with everything that was left on it.

2018
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Pushes the cat out of the way.

2019
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Meow!

2020
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
With Xbox Fusion's new

2021
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
telekinetic abilities

2022
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
it can move your furniture for you.

2023
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Arrange in room for Kinect.

2024
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
That would be hilarious. I want one of those giant

2025
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
holes that opens up in the ground to drop

2026
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
people I don't like out of sight forever. Creating the

2027
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
high wall. Couch moves in the place.

2028
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Alright, now we're getting

2029
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
stupid. Let's get to the foogle question

2030
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
of the week.

2031
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Facebook, Google Plus.

2032
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Slam them together, you get foogle.

2033
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
It's the foogle question of the week. Every week

2034
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
we ask a question of our fan communities and read

2035
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
some of our favorite answers here on the show.

2036
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Again, like last week, way

2037
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
too many answers. I can only read

2038
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
some of them tonight. I'm sorry guys. Let's start

2039
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
on Google Plus with the

2040
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
answer to the question about pinball.

2041
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
DarkSakura likes to talk about

2042
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
pinball a lot on the show.

2043
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
A lot you guys. She talks about it

2044
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
a lot. She's talked about it five minutes ago.

2045
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
We played pinball last night.

2046
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Also in the news this week we are hearing

2047
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
that pinball FX2 is coming to steam as she

2048
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
mentioned a minute ago. What do you think about

2049
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
pinball? Are there some pinball tables that you

2050
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
can't pass up playing when you see them?

2051
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
How about pinball video games? Are there any favorites

2052
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
that you have or will you only play the

2053
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
real thing? Let's go to Google Plus with some of the answers

2054
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
here. IceP on

2055
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Google Plus. I love

2056
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
that name. I think my favorite

2057
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
simulators were Pinball Dreams, Pinball

2058
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Fantasies, and Slam Tilt on the

2059
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Amiga. You just

2060
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
the very first thing a listener named was my

2061
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
absolute favorite. Pinball Dreams was on the

2062
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
PC as well. I know it was more known as an Amiga

2063
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
game. I think it was amazing and Pinball Fantasies

2064
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
was great too. I'm sorry

2065
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I just had one of those random thoughts. What?

2066
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
There's a Commodore 64 set that works for

2067
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
iCade. Just letting you know.

2068
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Oh, the emulator thingy? I have

2069
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
that.

2070
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Stoked. Anyway, back to pinball.

2071
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
How can you of all people

2072
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
change the topic away from pinball?

2073
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Shame on you. Now we're talking about

2074
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Dragon Crush?

2075
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Going back to IceP.

2076
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I love the fact that these weren't real

2077
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
tables. The way no one could

2078
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
unfavorably compare them to the real thing.

2079
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Plus it allowed them the freedom to let their

2080
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
imagination run wild.

2081
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Panaxium says, I remember my first pinball

2082
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
game was Moraff's Pinball back on the

2083
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
386. I was too young

2084
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
to understand how awful of a game that was.

2085
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Later I got hooked on Epic Pinball

2086
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
and that was a blast. However, I don't think

2087
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I ever had the chance to play a real pinball table.

2088
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Really?

2089
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
You never played a real pinball table?

2090
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I guess maybe that's one of those things I take for granted.

2091
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Bars. I mean, maybe you're not

2092
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
a bar person, but a lot of bars have them.

2093
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Have pinball tables.

2094
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Bowling alleys? I don't know if that's a thing.

2095
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Movie theaters.

2096
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
And John's Incredibly

2097
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Crappy Pizza. You need to go find a pinball

2098
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
table, son. Alright, Travis

2099
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
H. on Google Plus says, I love

2100
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
pinball. Used to play the Addams Family table

2101
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
until my quarters ran dry at a rec center

2102
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
here in Florida. Also love the Indiana

2103
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Jones table. I play a lot of Zen pinball

2104
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
on my Vita. Collecting the tables

2105
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
and going back and forth with friends trying

2106
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
to top scores. Great game.

2107
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Remember Prop Cycle Addams Family?

2108
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Yes!

2109
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Wasn't that at California Extreme or something?

2110
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I need to figure out when that is this year.

2111
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Pinagogo's coming up in a couple months too, by the way.

2112
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Is it really? Yeah. I need to get these things on the calendar.

2113
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I just, isn't

2114
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
We're taking our jackpot. Isn't California Extreme

2115
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
almost always the last weekend in July because

2116
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I bet you it's the same frickin' day as Clue.

2117
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I bet you anything. Uh, that might be.

2118
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
But I know that for, well, Pinagogo's

2119
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
the one in Dixon, and we're taking

2120
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
jackpot there because

2121
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
the creator of jackpot in a bunch

2122
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
of the series is gonna be at

2123
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Pinagogo this year.

2124
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
No, it's July 13th to 14th this year.

2125
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I'll be in rehearsals that weekend,

2126
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
but maybe I can go on Sunday

2127
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
at least. We should still make it happen.

2128
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I know, I should. It'll be fun.

2129
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Anyhow, where were we?

2130
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
We're going to Facebook. Those are some of the answers

2131
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
from Google+. Please check out our community on Google+.

2132
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
to read them all. And I'm gonna read

2133
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
some of the answers here on Facebook as well.

2134
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Andy R. says

2135
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I still don't quite get pinball.

2136
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
It's fun to play, but I have

2137
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
no clue how to score well in it, and I always

2138
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
suck. I'm the guy that loses the ball

2139
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
in the first 10 seconds and gets saved by

2140
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
the noobsaver feature. I bought

2141
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Pinball Arcade on PS3 Vita

2142
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
recently after kickstarting the Star Trek

2143
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
table. It's pretty fun, even if my scores

2144
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
are abysmal, and it's a good distraction

2145
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
if I've got my Vita on me and I need to kill some time

2146
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
while I'm out. Any tips for Andy?

2147
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
There's actually

2148
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
a series of DVDs out.

2149
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
We've got a few of them, but a lot of them

2150
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
have been put on YouTube.

2151
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
It actually teaches you a little bit of the physics

2152
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
involved with a well-balanced pinball table.

2153
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
A lot of it is learning how to

2154
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
catch the ball with your flippers

2155
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
and learning where your

2156
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
triggers are, because pretty much it's

2157
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
really just a game of physics.

2158
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Here's the

2159
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
most common mistake new players make

2160
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
is that they hit both flippers at the same time.

2161
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Don't ever do that.

2162
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
The only time that might work

2163
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
is multi-ball, when it just so happens

2164
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
to be timed that way. But you've got to get yourself

2165
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
out of the habit of hitting both flippers at the same

2166
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
time, and if you can do that, that's the first step.

2167
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
And if you are just trying to keep from draining,

2168
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
keep your eye on the flippers.

2169
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
When you see that ball

2170
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
coming to your field of vision, hit whatever

2171
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
flipper it's going towards. Now I want to play some pinball.

2172
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Come to my house.

2173
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Come to my house! Jeremy J,

2174
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
my buddy from Koopa Club,

2175
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I want to give a shout out to that podcast. They're a

2176
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
fun little bunch. They just had a drunkie episode

2177
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
not that long ago either. Those are fun.

2178
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
So, looking forward to meeting him in

2179
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
August when they come out here for Gamer X.

2180
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
But anyway, Jeremy J says,

2181
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I'm dreadful at pinball in every form,

2182
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
whether it's on an actual table or a digital

2183
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
version. That doesn't stop me from really

2184
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
enjoying it though. I sunk 10 plus hours

2185
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
into Zen Pinball 2 and didn't even realize it.

2186
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
In terms of tables I wouldn't pass

2187
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
up. Anything horror related

2188
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
would have to get at least one go from me.

2189
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Twilight Zone, Creature from the Black

2190
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Girl Goon, etc. Creature is awesome.

2191
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
You used to have that one. We did.

2192
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Gaming Nerd says,

2193
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
real pinball is the way to go. While some

2194
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
pinball video games like Zen Pinball keep the idea

2195
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
alive without having to build an actual table

2196
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
from the ground up, it just doesn't feel the same

2197
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
as playing on real tables. With a real

2198
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
pinball table, the physics with the ball and the

2199
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
angle of the table are as real as it gets.

2200
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Video game pinball is emulated realism

2201
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
and can still run the risk of a bug

2202
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
in the physics engine used to simulate

2203
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
the ball's movement and hit detection against

2204
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
the bumpers, flippers, etc.

2205
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Plus, who doesn't love a machine full of

2206
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
flashing lights and that deafening loud knocker

2207
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
when you earn a free game? Not

2208
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
going to disagree with you, Gaming Nerd, but

2209
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
the real machines can be full of bugs, too.

2210
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
The ball's getting stuck,

2211
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
magnets not working.

2212
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
For example, we have a problem with our Twilight Zone

2213
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
right now, where if it doesn't warm up properly,

2214
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
the game will reset itself halfway through

2215
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
the first ball. We

2216
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
had to, actually for

2217
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
pinball tables, for them to work properly, they have to be

2218
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
very well calibrated. They have to be balanced.

2219
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
They have to, you have to

2220
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
make sure that your contacts are clean. You have to make sure

2221
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
the balls are clean.

2222
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Do you always make sure

2223
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
the balls are clean, Dark Sakura?

2224
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Well, we had a mention of

2225
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Twilight Zone earlier. With Twilight Zone,

2226
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
they also use

2227
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
ceramic balls.

2228
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
For Powerball,

2229
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
shut up.

2230
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
You guys should see the look on Rob's face.

2231
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
It's maybe a little

2232
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
troll face. Do you shine

2233
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
the balls yourself?

2234
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
You know what? Bite me.

2235
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Another thing, too, tables are

2236
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
actually waxed, especially if they're

2237
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
wood

2238
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
surface tables. There's a lot

2239
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
that has to be done. Even the type of leg that

2240
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
you use, because we have those nice brass ones

2241
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
on the World Cup. Sometimes even the

2242
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
leg you use on it, but so much goes into

2243
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
the balance of the game. You have so many different

2244
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
components to make sure it works.

2245
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Upkeep of

2246
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
a physical table

2247
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
is going to make or break you playing the game.

2248
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
So, would you say that after

2249
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
extended play on a wax table, that the balls would

2250
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
eventually become waxed as well?

2251
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Breakman in chat says, my balls need a good

2252
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
shining. You can shine your own damn balls.

2253
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Well, maybe after the show, he should just go do that.

2254
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I don't want to know about it.

2255
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
It's just pinball. Alright,

2256
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
VX JasonXV

2257
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
in chat asks a real question here.

2258
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
What is the reason for the free game

2259
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
knocker? That's a good question. Why is that fucking

2260
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
so loud when you win a free game? Is that just to

2261
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
draw attention in the arcade? Tradition.

2262
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Oh, tradition? I don't know. I think maybe

2263
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
actually, my thought of it being so loud

2264
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
is that, this is my own theory,

2265
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
is that it's so loud in an arcade

2266
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
that they want to draw attention

2267
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
to that you won one. That's what I figured.

2268
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
However, we were

2269
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I was playing jackpot last, actually

2270
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Deanna who

2271
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
was one of our DDR friends. Hi, Deanna.

2272
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Does she listen to the show? Probably not.

2273
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
She's at a baseball game tonight

2274
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
in Fresno. Okay. It's like, you're going to Fresno?

2275
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Well, with all those long flights

2276
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
to Japan, you would think she listens to some podcasts.

2277
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Yeah. Well, at any

2278
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
rate, she was

2279
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
playing World Cup, Dan was playing

2280
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Twilight, and I was playing jackpot. Those are the only three we have

2281
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
left. And then Dan got

2282
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
an extra ball because he was really good at

2283
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Twilight Zone. And I swear, I

2284
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
tilted the machine, or

2285
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
almost tilted the machine just because I

2286
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
wasn't expecting it. It was so loud.

2287
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
That's something that new pinball players should know about

2288
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
too, is that tilting the machine

2289
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
is okay. It's

2290
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
about finding the right balance. You can't

2291
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
slam the thing too much, but a little

2292
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
smack, you just got to slap it on the ass

2293
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
a little bit to get those

2294
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
balls right where you got to get them.

2295
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
The sweet spot for most tables is going to

2296
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
be right past the flipper. Yeah, tell us

2297
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
about that sweet spot. Shut up.

2298
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
And you use the palm of your

2299
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
bottom of your palm. You know what? Bye.

2300
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
And she's left.

2301
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I can't help it.

2302
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
You're talking about the sweet spot.

2303
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
How about the listeners? Back to the

2304
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
listeners on Facebook.

2305
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Burr says, my favorite

2306
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
pinball game of all time is pinball

2307
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
construction set. I loved making my

2308
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
own pinball tables on my Apple 2.

2309
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Where the hell is the Kickstarter for a remake?

2310
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I hear ya, except

2311
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
replace Apple 2 with Commodore 64

2312
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
and that was me. That game was awesome.

2313
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Like a Sega game too, where you can make

2314
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
a Genesis game that you can make pinball

2315
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
tables. They did, didn't they? I don't remember

2316
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
what it was called, but I remember at the back of the box there they had one

2317
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
that was like one bumper and

2318
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
all the flippers you could possibly fit on

2319
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
the screen. All flippers.

2320
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
That was all it was. Fabrice

2321
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
A says, sadly, pinball machines

2322
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
have become even more rare than arcade

2323
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
cabinets. I do enjoy pinball a lot.

2324
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Once you know how to score big,

2325
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
it's super addictive. I've played my fair share

2326
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
of pinball tables. Independence Day, High Roller,

2327
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
The Simpsons, Roller Coaster Tycoon,

2328
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Lord of the Rings, and the list goes on. The one I enjoyed

2329
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
the most was The Addams Family.

2330
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Very intricate.

2331
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Now Jamie, do they have a good Game of Thrones

2332
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
table? Cause I would imagine that, you know,

2333
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
that'd be pretty popular. If it's gonna

2334
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
come out, there would be Stern making it.

2335
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
But Stern, I think,

2336
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
has a...

2337
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
What was the last one that Stern did? Was it

2338
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Tron Legacy? I'm gonna have to check now.

2339
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
They actually have

2340
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
a deluxe one that has all the neon lights

2341
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
and everything around it too.

2342
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Shattered Hawk says, the girlfriend

2343
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
and I go to the Nickel Cade about once

2344
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
or twice a month. We spend most of the time

2345
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
playing the Star Trek and Addams Family

2346
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
pinball games. And lastly,

2347
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Edgar R says, I love pinball. I never

2348
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
passed up The Simpsons at my old local pub.

2349
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Again, those are just some of the answers from

2350
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Facebook and Google+. Sorry, I didn't have time to read

2351
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
them all. And tonight, I kind of picked people

2352
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
that don't usually get in chat and I don't

2353
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
usually hear from on the show in other ways.

2354
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Trying to spread the love around a little bit. So,

2355
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
I do encourage all our listeners though to read the

2356
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
complete list of answers at Facebook.com.

2357
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Metallica pinball is the last one.

2358
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
They have a Metallica pinball?

2359
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
They're gonna fuck that up just like they did

2360
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Guitar Hero. I think they also did a Kiss pinball as well.

2361
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Hold on. No, that's cool.

2362
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Alright.

2363
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Let's get back into some other news.

2364
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Oh, I guess it's my turn for other news too.

2365
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Nintendo possibly

2366
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
going into more free to play software.

2367
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I want to say we heard this rumor before.

2368
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
But this is about something that happened

2369
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
with Satoru Iwata and I

2370
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
think it was in an interview

2371
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
that was actually on Nintendo.co.jp

2372
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
The company is looking beyond

2373
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
digital distribution and is thinking about free to

2374
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
play games. Question.

2375
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
You talked about Nintendo's digital

2376
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
business in the presentation. I remember you said

2377
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
that in addition to the package software business

2378
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
the digital business could be a core business

2379
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
for Nintendo. Could you please give an indication

2380
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
as to how much you expect to generate in

2381
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
digital sales this fiscal year and the next?

2382
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Also, apart from replacing package

2383
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
distribution with digital distribution

2384
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I understand that you are developing network based

2385
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
products such as Wii Street U powered

2386
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
by Google. Do you expect to be able to

2387
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
make hit network based products and create a buzz

2388
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
in society? Here's the answer.

2389
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Also, as you pointed out, we think

2390
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
the digital distribution of package software

2391
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
is only the first step in expanding our digital

2392
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
business. We will not simply

2393
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
change our existing package software

2394
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
distribution channel. Rather, we might

2395
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
have many other types of business models

2396
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
in addition to package software.

2397
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
For example, we might see more games

2398
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
that are similar to free to play games,

2399
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
games that cost much less, or games

2400
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
that require a monthly subscription fee.

2401
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
That would be uncharted territory for

2402
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Nintendo. Digitalization allows

2403
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
for greater flexibility whereby having

2404
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
more ways to make payments, both software

2405
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
developers and consumers have more options.

2406
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
And Nintendo 3DS and Wii U

2407
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
have flexible systems to handle such

2408
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
treads, so it is now a question of

2409
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
putting these ideas into action. I

2410
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
can definitely say that Nintendo will make

2411
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
new offers that go well beyond

2412
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
simply replacing package software

2413
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
with digital software.

2414
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Now that doesn't necessarily mean

2415
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
free to play, but certainly they are looking

2416
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
at mixing things up a little bit and not just

2417
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
being digital versions of the same

2418
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
stuff. I think Jamie's

2419
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
next story ties into this a little bit as well,

2420
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
so I'll let her go next and we'll come back to this.

2421
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Although I do

2422
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
want to say, I will say real quick, I

2423
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
played that Wii Street U by Google. I was

2424
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
messing around with that on the Wii U a little bit this week.

2425
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
I had no idea that

2426
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
on Google Maps now, they're taking

2427
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
pictures inside of places.

2428
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Like, even like there's a nail

2429
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
salon up the street, you can look inside

2430
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
it and do the whole panoramic. Have you heard of

2431
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
what's it called, the secret door or something?

2432
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
It uses that inside view

2433
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
it takes you

2434
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
to random places around the world.

2435
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
There's an animation

2436
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
of a door opening and then you're

2437
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
quote inside with the

2438
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Google view. I had no idea

2439
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
that this was, I guess, I tweeted

2440
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
about it because I'm like, whoa, the Wii U thing

2441
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
lets you go inside places now and somebody

2442
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
responded and said, actually Google

2443
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
added that a while ago. I guess I missed that

2444
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
but that was, that's crazy. Now I have to ask

2445
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
the software I know is free right now.

2446
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Yeah. But

2447
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
it's not going to be free forever.

2448
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Is this something that someone would actually pay for?

2449
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
I mean, because it seems kind of dumb.

2450
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
No, because it's a little choppy. I mean

2451
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
it's neat, it's a really neat concept.

2452
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
But

2453
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
it's probably like internet browser where it's going to be

2454
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
free for forever and then they'll charge for it at some point.

2455
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
That's what I'm saying.

2456
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Well, they have this other thing that they're charging for

2457
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
that are videos. Like, you can

2458
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
download a video of a double decker

2459
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
tour thing going through, you know, parts

2460
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
of London and you can do the whole pan

2461
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
around with the thing. But they want to

2462
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
charge you like $1.50 for

2463
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
a couple minute, essentially like a two minute video.

2464
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
That's silly. But there's a demo

2465
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
that has a little bit of all of them and

2466
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
that's well enough. Anyway, sorry Jamie.

2467
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Alright, well, um,

2468
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
for people who own a Wii U, there

2469
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
is a freebie out there.

2470
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Tank Tank Tank is free on the Wii U

2471
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
eShop. Um, and then

2472
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
there's paid DLC.

2473
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
And then there's also Kung Fu Rabbit.

2474
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
So, uh, there also

2475
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
are virtual console updates with other

2476
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
games, um, including, these aren't

2477
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
free by the way. Pac-Man and Mega-Man

2478
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
are five bucks a pop.

2479
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
And then, um,

2480
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
there are also, let's see,

2481
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
there's some sales. There's Nano Assault Neo.

2482
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Zen Pinball 2.

2483
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
And then on the 3DS, there will be

2484
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Bear Shark. Bear Shark.

2485
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Okay. Gummy Bear's Magical

2486
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Medallion. My Writing Stables 3D.

2487
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Armageddon Operation Dragon.

2488
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Balloon Fight. Yay.

2489
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Um, and then on sale will be Marvel Pinball

2490
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
3D. 3D Classics Kirby's

2491
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Adventure. Uh, Dylan's

2492
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Rolling Western. Pushmo.

2493
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Fluidity Spin Cycle. That just makes

2494
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
me think of laundry.

2495
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Um, Tokyo Crash Mobs, Nano Assault

2496
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
EX, Art of Balance Touch, and Fun

2497
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Fun Mini Golf Touch.

2498
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Cool. Alright.

2499
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Uh, oh wait, I just want to say real quick. I actually played

2500
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
the Tang Tang Tank. I downloaded it. Cause

2501
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
now Nintendo has that cutting edge

2502
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
technology where it finally downloads things in the background.

2503
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
So I just set it up to download the one gig thing,

2504
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
whatever. It's really crippled

2505
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
because you can't even do story mode in

2506
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
it. All you can do is you can do like the versus mode

2507
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
or whatever like three times a day.

2508
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
And it's kind of silly. Like,

2509
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
there's not a lot to it. I was

2510
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I was, you can't do it online

2511
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
or anything. Like, what's the point

2512
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
of Tang Tang Tank with the silly pictures

2513
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
if you can't play it online? It's not free to play. It's a demo.

2514
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Yes, it is. It's a demo.

2515
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
It's not free to play. It's not free to play, yeah.

2516
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
So it's weird to me that we're calling this

2517
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
free to play. I mean, I understand that's how the news

2518
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
is reporting it. That's how Namco and Nintendo

2519
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
and all that. It's a demo.

2520
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
But it's just a demo you can kind of keep playing

2521
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
over and over again. I mean, maybe that's

2522
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Well, you can't keep playing

2523
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
it over and over again because you're locked

2524
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
three times. Then you run out of energy.

2525
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

2526
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Let me put it this way.

2527
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
That, I think the whole like time

2528
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
limit demo thing, you know, for

2529
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
you know, multiple

2530
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
plays is stupid.

2531
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Saints Row, when that first came out

2532
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
as a demo, was a 30 minute demo. I played

2533
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
the crap out of it. I played it over and over and over again.

2534
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
And it got me really hyped about the game.

2535
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
If I was only limited to play that three times a day,

2536
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
say, oh hey, I want to

2537
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
show my friend this game that's really awesome

2538
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
that I'm super hyped up about. Oh fuck, I can't play

2539
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
it until tomorrow because they're being fucktards

2540
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
about it. I mean, it's stupid.

2541
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
YYR in chat says, got news

2542
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
for you, Tank Tank Tank's retail version doesn't

2543
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
have online play either. You know, I feared

2544
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
that and how

2545
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
derpy dumb is that? That should have

2546
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
been an obvious thing to

2547
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
put in the game, but no.

2548
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
It just seems to me like that's a game though that,

2549
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
and I was excited about it for a while, but it just seems like

2550
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
it would lose something being outside of the arcade too.

2551
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Yeah, especially when you're sitting in the house

2552
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
playing it by yourself, it's just not the same, you know?

2553
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Well, no one wants to play by themselves, Rob.

2554
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Well, apparently Break Man does.

2555
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
If you remember earlier.

2556
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Playing with yourself really should only be like, nevermind.

2557
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I liked playing it in the

2558
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
arcade because I could just reach over and smack Dan

2559
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
in the head. Sometimes.

2560
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I like taking the pictures

2561
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
with the little wigs and things.

2562
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Alan said I looked like Nicki Minaj in one of them.

2563
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Great!

2564
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Actually, one of my old live journal

2565
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
icons is the little tank with the squid

2566
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
in it going, thank you.

2567
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
So.

2568
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Let's move on, Logie.

2569
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Alright, so let's see.

2570
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Let's talk about

2571
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Call of Duty. And I mean, we kind of knew this

2572
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
was coming because they had all this

2573
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
stuff at retailers, posters

2574
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
and information were leaking out about

2575
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Call of Duty Ghosts. And they finally

2576
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
had their announcement, yes, it's

2577
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
going to be coming out. It isn't as

2578
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
it was rumored to be coming out on

2579
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
next gen only. It's going to be coming out on

2580
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Playstation 3, Xbox 360

2581
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
and PC on November 5th

2582
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
and also next generation platforms

2583
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
at an unspecified date.

2584
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
No Wii U version was announced

2585
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
and I can also confirm that there is no

2586
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Wii U version as of right now.

2587
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Unless it's something that they're saving for some

2588
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Wii U thing that they're going to say, oh by the way

2589
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
it's Wii U now too. But

2590
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I just don't know if they made their money

2591
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
back on the Wii U version. I think that's what a lot of these

2592
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
companies are coming to decide that like

2593
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
hey, we're not really making a lot of money on it.

2594
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
But, apparently

2595
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
it's going to revolve around Ghost

2596
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
from Modern Warfare 2

2597
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
and they did

2598
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
say that the next gen

2599
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
version of the game is going to

2600
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
have a brand new engine.

2601
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Current gen version, sorry, it's going to be running on the same engine

2602
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
that Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3

2603
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
are running on.

2604
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
If you want to make that argument, it's the same game each

2605
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
year, go ahead.

2606
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
It'll be slightly different.

2607
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I'm looking forward to it.

2608
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I've played quite a bit Call of Duty recently.

2609
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I think you and a lot of people

2610
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
look forward to it. These games always sell like crazy.

2611
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I don't look for it to be that different, I just look

2612
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
for it to be fun. I mean, that's really it.

2613
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
The single player campaign

2614
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
might be cool because now I'm going back and playing through

2615
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
all the single player campaigns from them.

2616
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
But as long as the multiplayer is fun,

2617
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I don't know. I really wish they would just put

2618
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
a multiplayer version of that, only make it

2619
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
maybe half the price or something.

2620
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
But then, of course, they'd be cutting out profits.

2621
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
That's right. Profits, profits, profits!

2622
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Alright, anyhow, I'm

2623
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
so excited, you guys. It's been forever

2624
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
since we've been able to do a segment like this.

2625
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
The way this segment

2626
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
ties to games is really loose, but you

2627
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
know what? We've got to bring in an

2628
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
opportunity to make fun of local news!

2629
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Which I realize is the same as our

2630
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
breaking news theme, or NBC's

2631
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
breaking news theme, but you know what?

2632
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
It's all dramatic, all the same.

2633
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
So, this is about,

2634
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
and I know so many of you have read about this,

2635
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
this is about a man in New

2636
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Hampshire who was robbed

2637
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
at a carnival game trying to

2638
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
win an Xbox Kinect. That's

2639
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
the only way this ties to video games,

2640
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
that the ultimate prize was an Xbox Kinect.

2641
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
But you guys, this story is

2642
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
freaking priceless.

2643
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
It's too dumb to be real. It's priceless.

2644
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
It makes me think of The Onion.

2645
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Courtesy of ABC 40,

2646
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
coming out of, where are they

2647
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
based? Springfield. And Fox

2648
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
6, I guess they're owned by the same people.

2649
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
So here you go, courtesy of these guys.

2650
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
A clip from the local news.

2651
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I've searched years for the perfect mattress.

2652
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I don't care about the perfect mattress.

2653
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Mattress Hunter! He searched for

2654
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
the perfect mattress. I didn't say

2655
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
local commercials, I said local news.

2656
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Badly animated flash animation.

2657
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Alright, here we go.

2658
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Henry

2659
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Greboom says he lost his life savings.

2660
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
$2600

2661
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
on a carnival game and all he has to show

2662
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
for it is this stuffed banana

2663
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
with dreadlocks.

2664
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
What kind of idiot?

2665
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
He has a stuffed banana with

2666
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
dreadlocks. You guys have to see the picture. Let me make a prediction

2667
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
that this banana will go up on

2668
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
eBay with this story and he will make

2669
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
money. Right? And then

2670
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
he's in cahoots with ABC 40.

2671
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
We were expecting to win a few things and

2672
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
let the kids have a good time.

2673
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
It just didn't turn out that way.

2674
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Greboom says he attended a Manchester

2675
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
carnival run by Fiesta shows

2676
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
and wanted to win an Xbox

2677
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Kinect at a game called Tubbs

2678
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
of Fun.

2679
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
It's right next to the pinball.

2680
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Tubbs of Fun. It's probably not

2681
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
actually Kinect. I'm guessing it's probably

2682
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
an Xbox console with Kinect.

2683
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I'm thinking. Because how else

2684
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
could you justify $2600?

2685
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I mean that's how much you've been thinking.

2686
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I'm thinking that he's a little

2687
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
misrepresented. Tubbs of Fun.

2688
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Our contestants toss

2689
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
balls into a tub.

2690
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
When he practiced he says... Sorry guys.

2691
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
It's at max volume so I apologize. This is a little

2692
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
low. Sorry. It was easy.

2693
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
But something changed when he started

2694
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
playing for the prize and the balls

2695
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
kept popping out.

2696
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
The balls

2697
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
kept popping out.

2698
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
It's one of those games. It's clearly that game where you

2699
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
throw the baseball into the little... It's like the angled

2700
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
bucket, right? Kind of ski ball-ish.

2701
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Yeah. But I'm sure they switched

2702
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
the ball on you at the last minute or whatever.

2703
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
It's not possible that it wasn't rigged.

2704
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Greboom says he kept trying

2705
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
to win back his money by going double

2706
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
or nothing. He dropped

2707
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
$300 in just a few minutes.

2708
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Why do they have this guy walking

2709
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
down the street pushing his baby in the

2710
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
roller with this giant banana with dreadlocks?

2711
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
That's what cracks me up.

2712
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
I want to know why they're giving

2713
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
this fuckwad any attention at all.

2714
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Because it's so ridiculous.

2715
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Because it's funny.

2716
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
It's not funny. It's sad.

2717
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
It's like those gambling people, you know?

2718
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
...at $2300 more

2719
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
and soon lost all that as well.

2720
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I know it's a difficult game.

2721
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I've tried it myself. I've done it

2722
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
once. Missed probably 20 times.

2723
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Fiesta Show says the game is run by an

2724
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
independent contractor who's worked for

2725
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Fiesta for years. It's interviewing

2726
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
the contractor to see what happened.

2727
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Queen Simia in our chat room

2728
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
brings up a good point. On the plus side, that's a

2729
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
really big banana. Literally

2730
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
that's what she said.

2731
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Are there any scams at all

2732
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
with any of the games? Not that I'm aware of.

2733
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
We've had a lot of these game operators

2734
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
with us for years. The Traveling Carnival

2735
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
is now setting up here in Derry,

2736
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
New Hampshire, but you will not see

2737
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Tubbs of Fun.

2738
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Because he's taking a vacation because

2739
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
he just made $2300.

2740
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
He's like, fuck that. I can skip this next one.

2741
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
It's the seriousness of that. You will not see

2742
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Tubbs of Fun or any fun

2743
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
whatsoever.

2744
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Is this the Daily Show right now?

2745
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
That's why

2746
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I thought this was onion-worthy.

2747
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
But if

2748
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
I had $2600

2749
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
as my savings

2750
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
and I wanted to buy an

2751
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Xbox. But Jamie, he was just

2752
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
addicted. He had to keep doubling down.

2753
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
He had to win that money back. And he's a fucking idiot.

2754
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Allegedly.

2755
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Allegedly. No, I'm saying it.

2756
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I'm going on record. In my opinion

2757
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
sir, Mr. Banana,

2758
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
you are Tubbs

2759
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
of Stupid. And now he has this

2760
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
giant banana he's got to feed too as well as

2761
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
his children. I mean a banana of that

2762
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
size is going to eat a lot of food.

2763
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Donkey Kong is coming for you.

2764
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
That's a lot of potassium.

2765
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
And maybe listen to a lot of reggae.

2766
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
And smoke some stuff.

2767
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Independent contractor that runs

2768
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
the game is not allowed to set up

2769
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
while an investigation

2770
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
is taking place. Because you get caught

2771
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
up in the whole double or nothing. I've got to

2772
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
win my money back. Henry says he went back

2773
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Notice something about this shot.

2774
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Jamie, I want to point this out to you while this guy is being

2775
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
interviewed. The baby is left

2776
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
alone in the stroller with only the

2777
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
banana to comfort him. And he's

2778
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
struggling to get out.

2779
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Did you see what Bobby just linked in chat?

2780
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
No.

2781
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
CollegeHumor wants

2782
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
to pay $2600

2783
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
for a giant dreadlock

2784
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
stuffed banana. Of course.

2785
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
This guy will end up making a profit

2786
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
off this story. He will sell it on eBay.

2787
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Oh my god. And

2788
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
here we are in debt.

2789
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
He's just an idiot.

2790
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Why would you try? I mean, come on.

2791
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
I understand that you may have gotten caught

2792
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
up in the moment, but

2793
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
it's not like you're gambling to win money

2794
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
in a casino. You're gambling to win

2795
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
an object that has a certain value.

2796
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
And that value is certainly not

2797
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
$2600. How many people who lose

2798
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
money in casinos do they interview saying

2799
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
men but life savings playing

2800
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
penny slots. Yeah, but you can't

2801
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
win a banana with dreadlocks at a casino.

2802
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Yes, you can.

2803
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Oh, really, bitch? Yes, you can.

2804
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Well, you can get things that are equally

2805
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
as ridiculous. Like, you know, Circus Circus

2806
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
and Excalibur have all those little

2807
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
games in the basement. I want to know.

2808
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Hold on, hold on. Raginator in chat says

2809
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
will he get a hammock for that banana?

2810
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
That's a good question. It's big

2811
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
enough. BlackWolf wants to know

2812
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
or BlackWolf suggests we need a giant

2813
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
orange with dreadlocks. Instant

2814
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
money. You know what, Bobby? I can make that for

2815
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
15 bucks. I'll do

2816
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
it, too. Who designs

2817
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
these stuff things like they're

2818
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
like, was it like a dartboard

2819
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
like a dartboard? It says, you know,

2820
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
fruit and the accessory

2821
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
banana

2822
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
dreadlocks, orange

2823
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
cowboy hat. They should

2824
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
freaking hire me. I could just I could design some

2825
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
really disturbing stuff. The Chinese

2826
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
he went back the next day to complain

2827
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
and the man running the game gave

2828
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
him back $600.

2829
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
See, that's the crazy. The guy gave him back

2830
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
$600. What carny gives you money

2831
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
back?

2832
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Sorry for you. Yeah, that's where

2833
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
the story gets shady. Why did the carny give

2834
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
him money back? Probably because he's like, I bet

2835
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
my life savings and the guy felt a little bit bad.

2836
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I mean, I mean, how much the guy

2837
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
is just making cash. I mean, he's not losing

2838
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
any. There's nothing to really run this game.

2839
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Let's wrap this up and re split with

2840
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
the banana and the cash.

2841
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Thank you for working that pun in.

2842
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Oh, thank you. I was

2843
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
worried that

2844
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I love you. Local news. He's

2845
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
split with a banana and

2846
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
filed a report with Manchester PD

2847
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
for once in my life. I happen to become

2848
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
that sucker. At least

2849
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
he admits it.

2850
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I

2851
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
did.

2852
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Did he redeem himself

2853
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
a little bit for at least a minute? No,

2854
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
because he's still stupid. You

2855
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
can admit that you're stupid, but it doesn't change that

2856
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
you're stupid. He admits

2857
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
that you're stupid. He's

2858
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
actually pretty much ruined his

2859
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
whole case because he admitted

2860
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
that he was fooled.

2861
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Dear College

2862
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Humor, give me

2863
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
$2600

2864
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
and I will draw you a banana with

2865
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
dreadlocks. I will go find you that banana.

2866
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I'm sure we can purchase it on the internet.

2867
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
With $2600, I'll

2868
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
buy a plane ticket to Hong Kong and go find

2869
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
the manufacturer factory and get one.

2870
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Let me finish my plea for a job.

2871
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Dear College Humor,

2872
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
contract me for $2600 to do nothing

2873
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
but make fun of this guy.

2874
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
I promise you I could do it for days on end.

2875
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I would never get tired.

2876
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
YYR

2877
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
says that was some hardcore

2878
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
punography.

2879
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Punography.

2880
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
It would only be if the pun was written.

2881
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Let's go to the mailbag.

2882
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Let's see what lovely puns await us

2883
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
in the mailbag.

2884
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Every week you guys send us emails.

2885
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Mailbag at

2886
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2887
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
and we pick a few of our favorite emails and read them

2888
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
here on the show. DarkSakura,

2889
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
what do we have tonight?

2890
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
People tripping.

2891
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
This one is titled, Damn

2892
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Used Games.

2893
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
And this comes from someone with

2894
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
a very unpronounceable name so I'm just going to say

2895
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
read the email.

2896
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Hello OLR cast, my name is Zile Scott.

2897
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Thank you. You said the name.

2898
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
He sold me to.

2899
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Put your name in the body of the email.

2900
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I'm going to read it.

2901
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I was just wondering if any of you guys know of a website

2902
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
that I could print out cover art for used games

2903
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
that have lost their original

2904
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
it's not T-H-E-R-E

2905
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
it's T-H-E-I-R original

2906
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
case.

2907
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
I recently bought a shitload of PS1 games

2908
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
and none of them have cover art.

2909
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
It makes me sad and annoyed.

2910
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Anyway, thanks and keep on with the great work.

2911
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Hugs and shit.

2912
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I don't know of any sites per se.

2913
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Not even.

2914
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Honestly, you know what I do in his position?

2915
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Just go to Google Image Search

2916
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
and search for the game

2917
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Look for large.

2918
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
And do large.

2919
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Don't blow up a medium size because it will look terrible when you print it out.

2920
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Or you can pay me $2600

2921
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
and I will go get all the shit

2922
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
printed for you at King Ghost

2923
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
and it will all be nice.

2924
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
You pay me triple that and I'll redraw it all for you.

2925
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Honestly, yeah, Google Image Search

2926
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
is what I would use.

2927
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Worst case scenario, Amazon.

2928
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
That's how you find a lot of missing CD covers.

2929
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
But if you don't want it to look shitty

2930
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
look for Hi-Rez.

2931
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Queen Simeon in our chatroom says

2932
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
draw your own. Those are the best.

2933
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Our Dracula X copy that

2934
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Kristen made us back in the day

2935
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
has her little stick figure

2936
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Richter Belmont

2937
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
with flaily arms

2938
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
and a whip.

2939
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
No, you know what this guy needs?

2940
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
This guy needs video game covers

2941
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Comic Sans and clipart.

2942
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Have you seen this?

2943
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
That's what you need, sir.

2944
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
You need to just forgo the original covers

2945
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
and get Comic Sans and clipart

2946
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
redos, reimaginings

2947
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Do it yourself. It can be a fun project.

2948
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
That's right. Why not?

2949
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Make the best out of it.

2950
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
For the record, Rob, those make baby Satan cry.

2951
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Make baby Satan cry?

2952
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Little fiery tears.

2953
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Little tears of lava.

2954
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
You want to hear something really crazy?

2955
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
More than one manufacturer of giant bananas

2956
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
with...

2957
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
God, you looked it up.

2958
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
It's just seriously strange.

2959
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
They seriously have one.

2960
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
It's not exactly the same banana.

2961
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
It's 150 bucks, by the way.

2962
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
It's uglier. 150 bucks?

2963
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Well, that guy got a pretty good deal.

2964
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
No, he didn't.

2965
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
He got 600 of his bucks back

2966
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
and then $150.

2967
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
He only lost two thirds of his money.

2968
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
For a carnival, that's not bad.

2969
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
And he had

2970
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
tubs of fun, people.

2971
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Tubs of fun.

2972
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
For the record, I need to find those covers that

2973
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Krista drew me back in the day and scan them in

2974
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
because they're freaking hilarious.

2975
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Especially the one for Emerald Dragon that was pretty funny, too.

2976
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says,

2977
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Someone who missed out on the Nino Cooney Wizards book

2978
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
made his own. That was awesome.

2979
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
But you can still hire me and I will be

2980
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
more than happy to lay out anything you want me to.

2981
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Let it go. Get to the next email.

2982
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Hey, I've actually got a job option.

2983
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
You know what?

2984
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
You know what? Just print your own bananas with dreadlocks

2985
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
for the cover. Final Fantasy 7,

2986
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
banana with dreadlocks. Actually, banana

2987
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
with spiky mohawk for Final Fantasy 7.

2988
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I predict this year. It has me crying.

2989
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
This year, instead of

2990
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
space ponchos, it's all about bananas with dreadlocks.

2991
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
That is going to be the new trend.

2992
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Bananas with dreadlocks. Why not?

2993
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
You know, actually, I was thinking of applying

2994
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
for the River Cats. Oh, yeah?

2995
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
They have a marketing position open. They do.

2996
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
My mom was- It's a full year, full time.

2997
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
My mom was telling me to go for an announcer

2998
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
position with them some time ago and I was like,

2999
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
really? Me announcing baseball?

3000
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Do you really see that? It would be hilarious.

3001
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
I'm the guy, hit the ball and things happen

3002
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
and somebody just caught it.

3003
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Oh my god, y'all. Balls are flying

3004
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
everywhere.

3005
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
No.

3006
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
The pitcher

3007
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
just hit the batter.

3008
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Girl.

3009
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Shut up.

3010
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Alright, next email, dammit. We only have one

3011
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
more. Hello, O.L.R.

3012
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Hi.

3013
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
What was that?

3014
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
You went high and I lost my

3015
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
shoes.

3016
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
I was being nice to the listeners.

3017
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
You said hello, I said hello.

3018
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Rab!

3019
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
I've got a question for all the hosts.

3020
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
There are many games

3021
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
across all generations that have become

3022
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
known for their final boss fights, such as

3023
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
The Doomsday Zone and Sonic 3

3024
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
and Knuckles or GLaDOS and Portal.

3025
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
My question to you is, which final

3026
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
boss fight in a game is your favorite?

3027
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
As for mine, I know you guys

3028
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
don't like the game

3029
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
getting a lot of praise, but I absolutely love

3030
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
the final fight against

3031
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Ganon in The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

3032
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
From the moment he transforms into

3033
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
the beast that we knew from the previous

3034
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
games in the series, the music sends chills

3035
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
down my spine, as well as the

3036
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
setting of a fallen castle is surrounded

3037
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
in both flames and the crashes

3038
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
of lightning and thunder across the sky,

3039
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
with Zelda's standing watch,

3040
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
sometimes screaming in fear when Link takes

3041
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
a blow from Ganon. If you need your memory

3042
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
refreshed of why I think this fight is so awesome, you can watch

3043
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
it here, not clicking the link, because I know.

3044
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Thanks for reading, Ocifer.

3045
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
PS, this email has been brought to you

3046
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
by me and my everlasting love of the show

3047
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
hosted by the gingerbread man.

3048
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Um, I would say that

3049
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
when I was younger,

3050
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
like, it was probably this

3051
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
battle.

3052
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Yes!

3053
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Eat your damn vegetables, you stupid frog!

3054
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Because the war battle

3055
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
was pretty epic at that time.

3056
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Like, this music was just like,

3057
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
oh my god, he's gonna kill me!

3058
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
And then you feed him veggies and it's okay.

3059
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Uh, otherwise,

3060
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
maybe the Kefka battle in Final Fantasy 6

3061
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
was pretty damn epic. Uh, I

3062
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
honestly, not that

3063
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
the battle itself was epic, but

3064
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
the original Metal Gear on the NES,

3065
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
that whole ending sequence

3066
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
was pretty damn amazing.

3067
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Well, you mentioned the Kefka battle.

3068
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
It was waiting

3069
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
for Shadow at the end of

3070
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
the game that was, like, the big

3071
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
epic teaser.

3072
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Um, honestly,

3073
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
um, I liked Final Fantasy 7's

3074
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
final battle, because it was so fucking

3075
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
easy and I could make a sandwich.

3076
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
While the whole thing was on autoplay.

3077
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Um, god, there was another one, though,

3078
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
that I, um,

3079
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
I remember being completely happy with the

3080
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
ending, more that I was

3081
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
with the last battle. You know what?

3082
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
I always liked the last fights, the Wily

3083
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
fights in the Mega Man games, because it is the

3084
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
stupidest weapon that you use.

3085
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Mega Man 3 used Top Man's weapon, the fuck.

3086
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Bubble Man 2, or Bubble Man in Mega Man 2.

3087
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Yeah, but Bubble Lead was actually useful.

3088
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Yes, it was, but to shoot it, to kill a

3089
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
boss in an empty room,

3090
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
that sucked.

3091
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
No, getting Top Man and

3092
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
jumping on top of the Wily floater thing.

3093
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
You have to kill him by topping him.

3094
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
You have to top his floater.

3095
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Um, there was a few,

3096
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
there was. Loki, what about you?

3097
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Epic boss battles, do you remember?

3098
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Um,

3099
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I can't

3100
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
really think of any

3101
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
big boss battles, um,

3102
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
I guess some of the boss battles

3103
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
in Earth Defense Force are pretty epic.

3104
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Especially some of the later levels, they were just

3105
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
ridiculous. But, um,

3106
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I haven't played anything with

3107
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
real big boss battles lately.

3108
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.

3109
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Yeah, the Technodrome fight.

3110
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Um,

3111
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
God, I remember the first time I beat

3112
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
that game, too. It was, it was actually

3113
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
the day my little brother got hit by a car.

3114
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Aww. And so, my

3115
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Grandmom left me and my friend Jennifer at the mall

3116
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
back when it was the old school lands castle

3117
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
that still had carpeted walls.

3118
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Before Namco bought it.

3119
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Yep. And, uh,

3120
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
These guys

3121
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
gave me money to help them

3122
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
beat the game. They, um, they paid for me to play

3123
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
as Leonardo, because that was the only slot open.

3124
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
And we had just beaten the game, and the thing

3125
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
was just starting, and they turned off all the machines

3126
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
because it was time to go. I know, I know.

3127
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
I know one epic boss battle.

3128
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
I got my revenge because I got to do the same thing.

3129
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Max 300 is pretty epic

3130
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
getting to that. Yeah.

3131
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
I can, you know, I can consider that, or, um,

3132
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
shoot.

3133
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
The Legend of Max? No, um,

3134
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Robo Z.

3135
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
In, uh, Bust a Move.

3136
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Because remember that, you're

3137
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
going through the game, and everybody's your size

3138
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
and everything.

3139
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Pull up, pull up, fly into your soul.

3140
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Real quick.

3141
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
And for anyone who, um,

3142
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
hasn't played the game, like, um,

3143
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
uh, Bust a Move,

3144
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
uh,

3145
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
that came out in the US, and, um,

3146
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
in the US, it was Bust a Groove.

3147
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
In Japan, it was Bust a Move.

3148
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
You can hear this music start.

3149
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
And you're on a building,

3150
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
you're this little teeny tiny thing

3151
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
with a robot, like,

3152
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
this bigger than the building.

3153
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Like, twice the size of the building.

3154
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
It was epic. You have cars running

3155
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
off the edges, and all this

3156
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
shit, and, oh my god,

3157
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
that was the best game.

3158
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
Alright. Good email.

3159
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Thank you.

3160
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
I'm actually gonna say that Robo Z

3161
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
is my

3162
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
number one favorite boss battle.

3163
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Number one favorite boss battle.

3164
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Alright, uh, if that's it for emails,

3165
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com

3166
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
if you want to get in on a future email

3167
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
bag segment. Uh, let us

3168
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
get to the FUs of the week.

3169
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
It's the part of the show where we get angsty.

3170
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Why? Um,

3171
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
I don't know.

3172
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
...

3173
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
...

3174
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
...

3175
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
...

3176
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
...

3177
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
...

3178
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
...

3179
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
I have two. The first one goes

3180
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
towards me. I think I'm fighting off something.

3181
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
So I'm just probably gonna take it easy tomorrow.

3182
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Um, cause,

3183
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
well, I think that I'm just a little worn

3184
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
down because I've maybe gotten

3185
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
five hours of sleep, uh, last night and the

3186
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
night before and then went to the baseball game yesterday

3187
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
and was up all night and it was a new stuff.

3188
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
And, actually I have three.

3189
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
It turns out that my wheat and corn allergy

3190
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
is a lot worse than I thought.

3191
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Which, the only reason I eat anything wheat

3192
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
today is because I took plenty of Enidril before the show.

3193
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
But I think that it's

3194
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
definitely gonna have to get cut out altogether

3195
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
and I keep pushing it and

3196
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
I'm just happier without it, you know.

3197
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
It hasn't stopped me from having ice cream.

3198
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
I can have ice cream as long as I don't have cookies

3199
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
in my ice cream. So.

3200
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
The cookies are good though.

3201
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Rob, I can get gluten free cookies.

3202
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
There you go.

3203
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
And, um, the other one, uh,

3204
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
goes towards

3205
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
there not being an actual third

3206
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Bust-A-Move game.

3207
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
And not counting Dance Summit.

3208
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
I'm not counting Dance Summit.

3209
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
We need an actual new Bust-A-Move game.

3210
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Dear Squeenix,

3211
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Dear Squa part of Enix,

3212
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
when you absorbed the

3213
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Enix to become the conglomerate of

3214
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Squeenix, you also inherited

3215
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
the Bust-A-Move series.

3216
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Do something with it!

3217
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
The end.

3218
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Um, Frisbee.

3219
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Have you ever been headbutted by your son?

3220
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Um, yes, but that was in my head.

3221
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Um,

3222
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
Becky was telling me about when Julian

3223
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
was like two, he would run in while

3224
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Chris was playing Xbox games and headbutt him

3225
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
in the crotch. Nice.

3226
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
He was an accident. He doesn't know how to

3227
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
throw a Frisbee correctly yet, so

3228
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
he threw it behind him. You'll learn him.

3229
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
He was a good kid.

3230
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
My FU of the Week goes to the

3231
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
fact that Alan made all these french fries

3232
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
before the show and I ate them all

3233
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
and this is why I'm bad.

3234
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Bad.

3235
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
But they were so good.

3236
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Two more stories, then we're gonna open up the

3237
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

3238
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

3239
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Two more stories, Loki.

3240
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
So, um, they announced a brand new

3241
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
exclusive game coming to the Ouya.

3242
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
It's, um, being done by

3243
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
KimSwift and Airtight Games

3244
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
who did Quantum Conundrum.

3245
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
It's called Soulfjord.

3246
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
It's a cross between

3247
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
70's Funk and Norse Mythology.

3248
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
And it's got a guy named Magnus Jones

3249
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
who is like a viking with an afro.

3250
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
I don't know, it looks cute. It's like a beaten up game.

3251
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Is it something I'm gonna be picking up? I don't know.

3252
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
But it's supposed to be, uh,

3253
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
coming, I guess, uh,

3254
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
soon.

3255
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Not sure it's coming. Like most things, soon.

3256
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Yeah.

3257
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
One more story for you guys, and this is about a very

3258
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
interesting, uh, demake

3259
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
of a game. And this

3260
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
kind of blows my mind, actually.

3261
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Um, you know, in China

3262
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
they tend to do this bootleg

3263
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
software. Uh, and a lot of times

3264
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
it's current titles that they cram into

3265
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
these 8-bit carts, and usually they're hacks

3266
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
or things like that. Like, we've seen Tekken, the

3267
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
8-bit version, and all this crazy shit, right?

3268
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
The RPG. Yeah, right? Like, all this crazy

3269
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
shit, right? Well, here's an interesting one

3270
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
they did recently. They demaked

3271
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Final Fantasy 4. What?

3272
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Yes, Super Nintendo Final Fantasy 4.

3273
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
They demade it

3274
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
for the Famicom.

3275
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
God dammit.

3276
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Don't

3277
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
play the smoking commercial. Trickyotomyman!

3278
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
I don't know what, that always

3279
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
made me think of Dennis Leary. God dammit,

3280
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
I just wanted to see the stupid

3281
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
demake, and I got a stupid commercial instead.

3282
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
And I want meat from only cows that smoke.

3283
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Okay, am I gonna get the commercial again, or am I gonna get the game?

3284
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
Alright. I'm Bill.

3285
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
I've had diabetes since I was a little kid.

3286
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
I was a diabetes guy!

3287
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
When I turn the volume all the way down,

3288
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
it doesn't shut them up. That's annoying.

3289
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
So, sorry, I guess I can't play the music for you guys.

3290
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Adblock, adblock. But it's very...

3291
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
I'm trying not to use

3292
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Adblock, because I'm supporting my favorite internet

3293
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
websites. You can whitelist

3294
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
your favorite internet websites. Well, I'm gonna blacklist

3295
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
those sons of bitches, but anyway,

3296
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
because if I can't turn the volume down,

3297
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
anyway, it's

3298
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
got, the soundtrack

3299
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
has been shoved into the 8-bit cartridges

3300
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
very well, which is really amazing,

3301
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
and the, for 8-bit,

3302
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
it looks pretty good, I gotta say.

3303
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
They've spread it across three

3304
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
cartridges, though, because, you know, Super Nintendo

3305
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
versus Nintendo, they have the

3306
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
light game, the dark game, and

3307
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
the, I don't know, the end game, or something

3308
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
like that, and because

3309
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
you can't transfer saves from one

3310
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
to the other, it basically recaps

3311
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
the story when you start one of the, and

3312
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
starts your characters at an appropriate level.

3313
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
You can play them in any order you want. It's just

3314
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
fascinating that somebody did a lot of

3315
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
work to do that for the Famicom.

3316
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Cool. Imagine if they had focused themselves

3317
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
onto, like, making an

3318
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
original game. I know, right?

3319
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
So there you go. Who does original

3320
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
things anymore? Please.

3321
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
This show's not even

3322
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
original anymore. What the lump.

3323
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Alright. Now I can't get that image

3324
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
of the chick with the tracheotomy out of my head. God

3325
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
damn you. You know what? I can't get

3326
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Dennis Leary's voice out of my head now.

3327
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Cow's the

3328
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
smoke. Had tracheotomies.

3329
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
We're

3330
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAMELR

3331
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
or our username on Skype, Orange

3332
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Lounge Radio, all one word, if you want to give us

3333
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
a call, and we can talk about

3334
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
whatever. You want to talk about demakes, you want to talk about

3335
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
remakes, you want to talk about anything we've talked

3336
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
about tonight, or something else,

3337
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
give us a call. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

3338
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
on Skype, or 1-877-GAMELR.

3339
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
In the meantime, I've got some tweets

3340
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
I want to read for you guys.

3341
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Tigerclaw sent us a few tweets at

3342
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
twitter.com slash O-L-R. First

3343
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
tweet, Sony Korea

3344
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
restricts PlayStation Network to 18

3345
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
plus. You guys hear about this?

3346
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
The Korea PlayStation

3347
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Network has been down for like 8 or

3348
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
9 months, and it just

3349
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
recently reopened.

3350
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
This is because of a law in South

3351
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Korea that will

3352
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
keep teens under the age of 16 from

3353
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
playing games during a 6 hour block at

3354
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
night.

3355
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Anyhow, let's go to the phones.

3356
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
It's ringing.

3357
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3358
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
It's the one and only Ranma. Hey, Ranma.

3359
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
How you doing?

3360
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
I'm good, I'm good.

3361
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Did you know that smoking is bad for you?

3362
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Why, yes it is. That's why I

3363
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
smoke other things, but that's not why I call.

3364
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
An endorsement from Mr. Spanky.

3365
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Why did you call?

3366
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Put the coffee on.

3367
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
You gotta talk.

3368
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
I'll get the cheesecake.

3369
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Fabulous, darlin'. Fabulous.

3370
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
What is up? What do you want to talk about?

3371
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Okay, I'm coming home on the train, and I

3372
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
tune in right about time with you. Loki's talking about

3373
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
piracy and everything, and

3374
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
I

3375
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
understand both sides of this,

3376
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
because even in my world that I

3377
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
cover, we have to deal with entitlement

3378
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
kids who feel that they shouldn't have to pay for

3379
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
anything because it's quote unquote free

3380
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
and available, but when those series

3381
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
are licensed, they don't want to pony

3382
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
up the twenty or thirty bucks to buy

3383
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
the entire series. And of course you're talking

3384
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
about anime. Yes.

3385
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
It's coming to another point, it's a financial

3386
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
aspect because

3387
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
truth be told, I don't, it's just me.

3388
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Nobody wants to drop three and four hundred

3389
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
dollars on a new console,

3390
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
knowing that the games are going to be

3391
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
fifty, sixty, and seventy

3392
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
dollars. So if there's a way to pirate

3393
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
it, so be it.

3394
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
And even if the game is like

3395
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
five, six dollars, people are still

3396
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
going to pirate it because that's five, six dollars

3397
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
that they're going to keep and put towards something else.

3398
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Yeah, but the question is

3399
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
if they were to put out a game, let's say

3400
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
a game like, I don't know, Tomb Raider

3401
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
since Jamie brought it up earlier in the show,

3402
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
she got it on sale. If they were to

3403
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
release Tomb Raider for five bucks,

3404
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
you'd probably have a whole lot of

3405
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
people jumping on that, but would it be

3406
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
twelve times the amount of people

3407
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
that would have bought it for sixty bucks?

3408
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
I think more people would have bought it

3409
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
at five bucks and at sixty.

3410
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
That's what it's coming down to. More? But would it be

3411
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
twelve times as many? Because that's how many,

3412
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
it's got to be more than twelve times as many.

3413
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
I really think it is because it's coming down

3414
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
to where you got to be cost

3415
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
consensus. I mean,

3416
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
most, almost every single

3417
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
PS3 360

3418
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
game I own, I paid

3419
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
anywhere between twenty and forty bucks.

3420
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
One or two, I paid retail

3421
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
price only because

3422
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
it was a game that I wanted or I got a gift

3423
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
card for it, done and done.

3424
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
And as for,

3425
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
you know, releasing the game on the

3426
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Pirate Bay, free like that,

3427
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
see, there's one thing

3428
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
about that, if

3429
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
you see this game,

3430
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
you're going to check the comments

3431
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
within the first five or six comments,

3432
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
somebody's going to be like, oh,

3433
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
this game has a hack in it,

3434
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
don't download, don't download, don't download.

3435
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Then you're going to go,

3436
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
find another torrent where it's the full

3437
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
game and you're going to grab that.

3438
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Well, what I

3439
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
understand about this particular story

3440
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
though is that the author

3441
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
put it up and it was downloaded so many times so fast,

3442
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
you don't figure out

3443
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
what's going on until you've played the game for a

3444
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
little bit. True.

3445
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Let's say, you know, like within an hour or

3446
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
so, people are going to go back to that torrent and be like,

3447
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
oh, don't download because

3448
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
Yeah, but in an hour it's been downloaded five

3449
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
thousand times already. And the sad part is

3450
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
that that torrent is still going, but

3451
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
if you're smart, you're going to stop that and just jump

3452
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
onto something else. Right, right.

3453
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
So, all

3454
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
right, well, anything else you want to share with listeners

3455
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
tonight?

3456
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
No, not really.

3457
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
I'm good. I just want to get

3458
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
that off my chest and agree with y'all about this whole

3459
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
piracy thing and

3460
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Where

3461
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
can I come give you a hug at an anime

3462
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
convention coming up soon?

3463
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Are you going to any anime conventions in the next

3464
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
couple weeks? I will be kidnapping

3465
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
the entire staff, putting them in

3466
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
a Snakes box and dragging them to

3467
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
anime next in June. Awesome.

3468
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
I wish you were coming to Fanime. It would give

3469
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
me a reason to go. I

3470
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
know, but I have my own personal reasons

3471
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
that I'm taking time off for the

3472
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
sponsor. I know, I understand.

3473
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
VXJ Snakes V is going to be there, so

3474
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
I'm still

3475
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
unpacking the shoebox studio, okay?

3476
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
All right, fair enough, fair enough.

3477
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
She'll do it anyway. All right.

3478
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Well, take care, Rama. Thanks for the call.

3479
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
You got it, bro. All right, later.

3480

1877 Game O L R, our username

3481
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

3482
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Also from

3483
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Tigerclaw, another tweet about Zone of the

3484
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Ender sequel on hold. The team

3485
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
was disbanded due

3486
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
to issues with the HD remake.

3487
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Did the zone get ended?

3488
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Yes, it was.

3489
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Oh, boy.

3490
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
This is actually from Hideo Kojima himself

3491
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
on Hideo Blog, the radio show

3492
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
that he does online, his little podcast.

3493
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
The proposed sequel

3494
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
in Zone of the Enders was ceased,

3495
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
and this was because the HD

3496
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
collection issues were the reasons

3497
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
behind the stop in development. I guess this

3498
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
doesn't mean that it can't come back

3499
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
later, but for right now,

3500
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
nope.

3501
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Bummer.

3502
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Again, 1877

3503
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Game O L R, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

3504
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
All one word.

3505
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Sj100matt tweeted

3506
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
us something about Grant Kirkhope,

3507
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
who's the composer of Perfect Dark,

3508
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
and Banjo-Kazooie, I thought you mentioned this

3509
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
earlier, offering their soundtracks up for

3510
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Pay Issue 1. Didn't we have that Perfect Dark story earlier?

3511
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Or did we

3512
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
skip it tonight? Oh, I guess I didn't

3513
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
show all that after all. Well, I was gonna cover

3514
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
this, but apparently not. So you can check this

3515
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
out, grantkirkhope.bandcamp.com

3516
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
payissue1 for Perfect Dark

3517
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
and Banjo-Kazooie. So if you,

3518
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Perfect Dark had a pretty good

3519
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
soundtrack, at least, I know. I didn't play

3520
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
a lot of Banjo-Kazooie, but I've played

3521
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
a lot of Perfect Dark on 360.

3522
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
With Sj100matt,

3523
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
when he had this little trolling device that worked.

3524
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Redertainment wants to know

3525
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
on Twitter, is there a reason the Christian right

3526
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
hasn't flipped their shit about the various

3527
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
religious comments in Bioshock Infinite?

3528
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Well, the

3529
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Westboro Baptist Church is getting ready to

3530
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
protest that Slayer guy's funeral,

3531
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
so that's probably what they're preoccupied

3532
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
with doing. Which, by the way,

3533
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
what a stupid idea.

3534
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
What a stupid idea.

3535
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Well, I guess I should take a step back even

3536
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
further. How unfortunate

3537
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
that that guy passed away and what sounds like

3538
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
what's really like a freak thing. Like,

3539
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
you first hear that the guy dies of liver

3540
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
failure and he can't help but think,

3541
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
oh yeah, rock and roll lifestyle, right? Liver failure.

3542
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
But it turns out he may have got like a spider bite

3543
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
a couple years ago that led to this

3544
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
because he didn't get a treat. Like, it's crazy stuff.

3545
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
I don't know if you guys have read about it. Very sad stuff.

3546
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Obviously Slayer has these hardcore

3547
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
fans that will carve the name

3548
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
of the band into their various

3549
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
pieces of flesh, and the

3550
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
Westboro Baptist Church is

3551
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
gonna go protest this guy's funeral.

3552
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Good

3553
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
luck. You'll need it.

3554
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Ah, it's gonna be violent.

3555
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
But nobody's gonna care.

3556
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
That's gonna be the hilarious part.

3557
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
So, um,

3558
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
yeah, so screw the Westboro

3559
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Baptist Church. But anyway, back to the question that was really asked

3560
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
by Redertainment. Is there a reason the Christian

3561
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
right hasn't flipped their shit about the various

3562
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
religious comments of Bioshock Infinite?

3563
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Bigger fish to fry right now? What do you think,

3564
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Loki? You've played Bioshock Infinite.

3565
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Why hasn't the religious right started complaining yet?

3566
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
I don't know why they would complain about it.

3567
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I mean, it's just, it's fictional. I don't

3568
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
really think it's gonna be,

3569
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
I don't know. It's

3570
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
not necessarily like saying religion's bad.

3571
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
It's just they're extreme

3572
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
in the scenarios of the game.

3573
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
So, I don't know.

3574
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
I don't know why they

3575
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
would waste their time on that. I mean, they're not PETA.

3576
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
I mean, I guess, you know, if animals are

3577
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
getting hurt or something like that, then maybe, you know,

3578
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
they'd come after them.

3579
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
You know, for example, if that horse scene was still

3580
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
there, maybe they would come after them.

3581
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
I just, I just don't

3582
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
think they care. Or they're aware of it. You know, they'll bring it

3583
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
up later on. You know, like how they,

3584
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
how those gun makers or whatever really

3585
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
get pissed off at, oh, that postal game.

3586
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
It's making people violent.

3587
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Yeah, wait, wait about ten years

3588
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
and then they'll finally catch up and start complaining about it.

3589
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
No Shock Infinite games. Like, what?

3590
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
They're just now getting around, you know, Super Mario World.

3591
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Grand Theft Auto 3

3592
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
is so violent.

3593
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Alright, I think that was it for

3594
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Twitter topics tonight. So, um,

3595
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
actually, wait, I want to go back. I thought I saw stuff earlier

3596
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
in the week. Let me go,

3597
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
let me go to Loki and ask if

3598
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
you have any last minute stories

3599
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
first. There is a fan made

3600
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Duke Nukem Forever mod

3601
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
being released for Duke Nukem 3D.

3602
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
It's based off the original footage from

3603
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
the 2001 E3 trailer.

3604
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
And, uh,

3605
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
you can download it for free

3606
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
on moddb.com

3607
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
slash mod slash duke

3608
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
dash nukem dash forever.

3609
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
And you just need a copy of

3610
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Duke Nukem 3D.

3611
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Can you play that on Steam yet?

3612
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
multiplayer?

3613
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
You can download it.

3614
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
I'm waiting for that. I found the tweets

3615
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
that I was looking for that I knew would come earlier

3616
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
in the week. What are the tweets you're looking for?

3617
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Oh, there are all the tweets I'm looking for.

3618
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
YYR tweeted us earlier in the week.

3619
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Now I'm drawing comparisons between the Wii U

3620
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
and Dreamcast in my head.

3621
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Might make an interesting conversation topic for

3622
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
OLR. Both were released way

3623
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
ahead of the competition and had difficulty

3624
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
garnering third-party support. But

3625
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
compared to its eventual competition,

3626
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Dreamcast held up better muscle-wise

3627
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
being comparable or even favorable

3628
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
to PS2 in some ways.

3629
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Um, too soon to tell.

3630
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
I get the comparisons with the whole fact that

3631
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
but didn't they also not make Madden on the

3632
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Dreamcast or one of the big sports games didn't

3633
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
didn't make its way over there. And that was

3634
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
kind of the beginning of the end. But I think there was

3635
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
a lot of other stuff that came into play too.

3636
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
I don't even think it's necessarily comparable because

3637
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
you know, spec-wise, I don't think

3638
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
it's comparable at all with the next gen system.

3639
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
I think it's more like the current gen stuff.

3640
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
It's just kind of an in-between thing.

3641
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
And yeah, it's their next

3642
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
generation of that console.

3643
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
But I wouldn't compare it to the next

3644
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
gen gaming systems.

3645
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
You're not going to be able to do what they do

3646
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
on those systems on that system.

3647
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Well, last call for calls.

3648
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000

3650
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
Loki, anything else?

3651
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Mega Man Limited looks

3652
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
cool. They got a new trailer for it. It's

3653
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
another fan-made game.

3654
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Maybe it'll get

3655
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
shut down by Capcom.

3656
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Earthbound 4

3657
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
apparently having a fan game.

3658
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
The creator

3659
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
said on Twitter this week, I want to say

3660
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
I'm not doing it. Not happening.

3661
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Very difficult to happen, so

3662
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
I kind of think you should never say

3663
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
never, but

3664
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
getting more games in the Mother

3665
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
series. I guess I should say Earthbound 4.

3666
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
It's technically Mother 4. Sorry. Sorry, Piras.

3667
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
But Mother 4.

3668
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
There you go. He could very well just put out an Earthbound game.

3669
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Exactly.

3670
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Gotcha!

3671
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
I didn't see anything about Earthbound.

3672
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
So.

3673
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Alright, well

3674
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
I guess no other calls tonight.

3675
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Y'all have been shy lately. We barely got

3676
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
any calls last week either.

3677
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
What's up with that? It's the show where every gamer

3678
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
has a voice if you use it.

3679
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
Alright, I'll shut down

3680
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
the Skype line for now. If you think of something later, you want

3681
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
to send us your thoughts. Mailbag

3682
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or of course there's always Twitter.

3683
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
We're afraid of the banana. We might stick a banana

3684
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
with dreadlocks on them? Yeah. Well, I'm hoping the Skype

3685
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
connection works. Maybe something's wrong there. I should've

3686
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
tested it, but. Alright, anyhow.

3687
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Well, Rama got through it, so I know at least

3688
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
one of it's working. Anything else,

3689
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Loki, you want to get out?

3690
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Nope. No?

3691
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Then I guess that brings us to the end of the show.

3692
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
I guess so.

3693
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
A little earlier than usual

3694
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
tonight, but it's only supposed to be about a three hour show

3695
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
with a break included, so that's alright.

3696
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
I want to thank you guys for

3697
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
tuning out tonight, or tuning out

3698
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
turning out tonight and tuning in. You're welcome.

3699
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
Now you can tune out.

3700
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Thank you guys very much for

3701
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
tuning into the show and supporting our show.

3702
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
If you like what you hear, don't forget to

3703
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
support independent radio. You know, there's a lot of people

3704
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
out there making podcasts

3705
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
just because they have voices

3706
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
they want to use and just trying to make

3707
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
a name for themselves and they're not asking

3708
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
for $35,000 of your money to make it happen.

3709
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Support indie podcasting

3710
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
and help the community grow.

3711
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
And if you want to help our podcast grow,

3712
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
tell a friend or two about the show.

3713
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Leave a nice review on iTunes. Thumbs up on

3714
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Stitcher and listening time on there really

3715
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
helps go a long way as well. Really, really

3716
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
appreciate it. Before we close up shop tonight,

3717
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

3718
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
DarkSakura, we'll start with you. Your final thought.

3719
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Exclamation point. Loki, your final

3720
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
thought tonight. Final thought is

3721
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
I have a lot of

3722
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
money to spend on Amazon soon

3723
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
and I don't know what to get.

3724
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
My final thought is I should have

3725
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
made you buy me that IK that I spent $40

3726
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
on this weekend. Fuck that, it's an IK.

3727
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Speaking of what IK, what they should do

3728
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
is actually come out with some sort of pinball

3729
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
version of it, you know, with Jesus Christ pinball

3730
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
and have the flippers and stuff and have

3731
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
a pinball game that supports it. Now you're talking

3732
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
my language, yes sir. Love it.

3733
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
I bet there's a pinball game that

3734
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
supports IK though.

3735
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
I would just go with PinMame and leave it at that, but

3736
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Why not? I'm surprised they don't have like

3737
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
PinMame on the iPad somehow

3738
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
even though, you know, the Apple

3739
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Gustavo locks everything down.

3740
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
There is the whole

3741
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
what is it just called pinball arcade?

3742
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
I don't know, I've got it on here.

3743
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
Yeah, pinball arcade, which is pretty good.

3744
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
If it had IK'd support it would be awesome.

3745
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Be nice. Alright.

3746
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Well that's it guys.

3747
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
We're done.

3748
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
That's another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3749
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Thanks you guys. We'll be back to do it again

3750
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
next week. Episode 504.

3751
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
I'm hoping we'll have an interview next week so stay

3752
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
tuned to Twitter. I'll tell you more about that as soon

3753
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
as I have that confirmed for this week.

3754
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
In the meantime, have fun gaming.

3755
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Thursday night, Forza Horizon, right?

3756
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Forza Horizon at 8 PM Pacific Standard Time.

3757
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
And Mass Effect 3 at 5?

3758
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
30? Thursday?

3759
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
All three of us broadcasting

3760
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
throughout the week, so

3761
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
tune into our channels and

3762
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
check that out. Have a great week

3763
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
everybody. We'll see you next time with

3764
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
more of Orange Launch Radio. Good night.

3765
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
You've been listening to Orange

3766
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
Lounge Radio.

3767
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Orange Lounge Radio is a production

3768
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
of OLR Studios.

3769
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
To join us for a live

3770
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
show, tune into

3771
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000

3772
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000

9 PM Eastern.

3774
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
The views and opinions expressed

3775
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
in this program do not necessarily

3776
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
reflect those of the staff

02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
of Orange Lounge Radio or

3778
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
VoGnetwork, but you know

3779
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
they were all still true.

3780
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
See you next week.

3781
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Thanks for watching.
