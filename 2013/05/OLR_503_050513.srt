00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:18,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, May 5th, 2013, one Wii U game finally goes free to play in the U.S.

2
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:20,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Could more be coming?

3
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:26,461
[SPEAKER_02]: The creators of Nyan Cat sue one video game maker, and could Respawn's next game be an Xbox exclusive?

4
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:37,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:45,296
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number 503 for May the 5th of 2013.

6
00:00:45,397 --> 00:00:47,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Cinco de Mayo to you guys.

7
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:53,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And on behalf of all Americans, I'd like to apologize to Mexico for Chevys.

8
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:55,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Because what is, seriously, what is Chevys?

9
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:56,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Delicious!

10
00:00:57,846 --> 00:00:59,988
[SPEAKER_03]: They have like the salad that I freaking like.

11
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,690
[SPEAKER_03]: and that corn stuff that I'm allergic to, I freaking love.

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So you shut your whore mouth.

13
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:08,055
[SPEAKER_08]: The voice of reason over there telling me to shut my whore mouth.

14
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:10,597
[SPEAKER_08]: The one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:12,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's mouth is a dirty whore.

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:20,526
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people can take that a lot of different ways and I don't appreciate you slandering me on this program.

17
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mouth is a freshly brushed whore.

18
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:24,830
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that even supposed to mean?

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,570
[SPEAKER_03]: It means it's clean.

20
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,131
[SPEAKER_03]: You brush your teeth.

21
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:31,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, who I will not call names for one minute.

22
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:38,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Reggie has sent you a secret Cinco de Mayo message because apparently your Wii is glowing.

23
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:42,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that Wii has been glowing for like two weeks.

24
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:44,630
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually, not even that, about a week.

25
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:55,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, my honest reaction when that thing started glowing blue, and I already know what the message is thanks to a news story coming up later, but when it started glowing blue, my honest reaction was, it was plugged in?

26
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:59,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God, I was like, the Wii was plugged in.

27
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:01,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I unplugged it after I moved all that.

28
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:03,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because there's literally nothing left on my Wii.

29
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:09,153
[SPEAKER_08]: I did the little Pikmin transfer thing to my Wii U because I wanted the discount on the virtual console games.

30
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:13,697
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's no reason for me to have the Wii except to use what?

31
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Forecast Channel?

32
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,542
[SPEAKER_08]: and Spin the Globe and see what the weather's like in South Pole.

33
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:20,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in June, they're pulling the plug on that.

34
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:29,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So I won't even be able to see what the weather's like in the South Pole anymore unless I actually pull up an internet web browser and look at weather.com or whatever.

35
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, what do you have that I have in my hand right now?

36
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:32,934
[SPEAKER_03]: You have an iPhone.

37
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:33,515
[SPEAKER_03]: A microphone.

38
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:34,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Bite me.

39
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:41,942
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is just put in Antarctica on your phone and hold on.

40
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Siri, you whore, what is the temperature in Antarctica?

41
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:52,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna see if Siri will answer.

42
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:54,336
[SPEAKER_03]: God, fucking Siri.

43
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, how great, yeah, how fucking wonderful.

44
00:02:57,297 --> 00:02:57,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

45
00:02:57,938 --> 00:02:59,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't find things in Antarctica.

46
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:01,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you be more specific?

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha!

48
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:03,421
[SPEAKER_08]: You bitch.

49
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that awesome device you have in your hand.

50
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:08,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, technology, so great, isn't it?

51
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:13,943
[SPEAKER_08]: The joys of live radio.

52
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:15,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no one can see me flip off, Rob.

53
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:24,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Also say hello to our live audience and the ever-present fourth guest on our program, the chatterers, live.vognetwork.com.

54
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:31,347
[SPEAKER_08]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

55
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:34,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, that's live.vognetwork.com.

56
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:37,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Misty started us off tonight saying, fucking Siri indeed.

57
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:38,109
[SPEAKER_08]: See?

58
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:56,823
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go, all the VOG listeners hate Siri, confirmed Oh, I feel so bad for True, having your first car be an 84 Mustang, which is like one of the worst years for Mustangs TigerClaw on chat says, did you see this week's SNL's weekend update when they made fun of Google Glasses?

59
00:03:58,244 --> 00:03:59,885
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think about that whole Google Glasses thing?

60
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:04,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's too expensive Yeah, do we know the price on those yet?

61
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:07,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna record everything I do Okay, we'll give you one for free

62
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:35,703
[SPEAKER_08]: VXJSXV in chat says, Rob Roberts, you skipped Loki?

63
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:36,183
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't.

64
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:37,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I would not make fun of him for a while.

65
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:39,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when I talked about the glowing light on the Wii?

66
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:40,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Where were you?

67
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:46,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, remember, Colorado did just recently legalize a little something something.

68
00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:47,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

69
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Jason's not into that.

70
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:49,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

71
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:51,575
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the other comment?

72
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:55,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, SSJ100Matt says, Jamie just wishes Siri was more like Edie.

73
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:56,238
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I do not.

74
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:56,618
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

75
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:57,618
[SPEAKER_08]: True facts.

76
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:58,719
[SPEAKER_08]: She might not be Joker.

77
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:05,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the Seth Green voice for my phone because that would be really... Actually, no, I want GLaDOS for my phone so that I can get directions while I'm being berated.

78
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:09,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't you get like a GLaDOS GPS thing?

79
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:10,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I saw that somewhere.

80
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:11,486
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what else they have?

81
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:20,131
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a Spongebob one and I went to a pinball event and the guy had one and I was like make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.

82
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:22,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Number 1, 1226

83
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:39,033
[SPEAKER_08]: 63,000 people backed it.

84
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:40,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of them backed it with getting a console.

85
00:05:40,614 --> 00:05:42,175
[SPEAKER_08]: So you were still one of the first few.

86
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was the first day.

87
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:58,083
[SPEAKER_08]: So you finally got your Ouya after waiting a couple weeks.

88
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:00,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It took like a month.

89
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:01,886
[SPEAKER_06]: They sent me a ship.

90
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:06,950
[SPEAKER_06]: It was going to ship back in April.

91
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

92
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,651
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the second week of April or something.

93
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:10,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And it took like two weeks to get here.

94
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

95
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:35,436
[SPEAKER_06]: We were still playing games over in our game room, which is basically an empty half of a building that we don't use anymore.

96
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:40,102
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just me over there when I go to play games.

97
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:46,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So I used two office chairs with that box and an Xbox 360 controller and leaned my phone against it.

98
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take a picture of it in comparison to the coffee cup.

99
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:06,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's about the size of the coffee cup.

100
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:07,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the coffee cup is bigger.

101
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:08,255
[SPEAKER_03]: The coffee cup is bigger.

102
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:10,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put my iPad behind it.

103
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:15,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Which shows you the priorities of our caffeine intake here at OLR.

104
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:19,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So DarkSakura is going to take a picture for OrangeLunchRadio.com right now.

105
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that go to Tumblr too when you do that?

106
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:22,339
[SPEAKER_08]: It can.

107
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:22,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

108
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:31,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I got it and I did the firmware update that they had on there and started downloading games.

109
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:38,600
[SPEAKER_06]: And then one of the first few days I started trying to sideload stuff because I wanted to see what exactly you could sideload on it.

110
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:45,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weird because they don't really have a way to root it, although you're supposed to be able to root it straight out of the box and be able to do everything with it.

111
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,288
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

112
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:01,108
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

113
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,714
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once you've done that, you set up your Wi-Fi.

114
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:35,723
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have it hooked up to the Ethernet, so you set up your Wi-Fi, and then you either create an account or you log into an existing account with OUYA if you need to have it or not.

115
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had an account already, so I logged into mine, and that's it.

116
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're greeted.

117
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:47,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I had to do a system update after that, so you do a system update, and then you go back to the main menu.

118
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:50,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have like four menu options you get to choose from.

119
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:51,574
[SPEAKER_06]: They have one that's basically settings.

120
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:54,657
[SPEAKER_06]: They call them all different things like manage or something.

121
00:08:55,978 --> 00:09:06,206
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a section that's make, which is basically all the sideloaded stuff for where if you're developing a game for OUYA, that's where you would dump your APKs and stuff and where you'd be able to play that stuff.

122
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's discover, which is their store.

123
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:11,450
[SPEAKER_06]: They have that.

124
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And then play, which is going to be all your games.

125
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,274
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went to the store and just downloaded like...

126
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:17,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything.

127
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:19,697
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I could.

128
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:24,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some stuff that I wanted to play since I'd seen video of it.

129
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:31,048
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my first downloads was No Breaks of LA because I was like, this looked hilarious on the video when I saw it.

130
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:32,830
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's pretty hilarious.

131
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the Final Fantasy 3 on there yet?

132
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:35,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Final Fantasy 3.

133
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the demo for it.

134
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:38,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm paying $15 for that.

135
00:09:38,655 --> 00:09:39,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just curious.

136
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:41,457
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing, too.

137
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:44,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything I've downloaded so far, I've not had to put any of my credit card information in yet.

138
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:45,180
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

139
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,662
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't have to put it in until you want to actually buy something.

140
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:55,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they changed that, too, in one of their very first... Remember, they had the whole rabble-rabble on the internet about that, and it changed pretty quick.

141
00:09:55,828 --> 00:10:02,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you can go in and change that stuff, and I think you can even remove it at any time or something.

142
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,058
[SPEAKER_08]: So what about the hack-in and all this?

143
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:06,063
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be this whole open thing.

144
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:08,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get in there and try to figure out?

145
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:11,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the first question I asked you was, did you get the emulators working?

146
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:12,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, yeah, I have the emulator.

147
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:21,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I have, I wasn't really, because of my, it's, it's emulators, so I haven't really bothered to, like, okay, I know what Mario Kart 64 looks like, you know, I'm not, I'm not in a huge hurry to put that on there yet.

148
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but sometimes, sometimes the emulators can be a little crappy.

149
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I do, well, I do want to play with it.

150
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, it's, like, they have G, GSNES, which I, I recognize that as, like, you know, PC thing, and then

151
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:36,150
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, I think, SNES 9X on there.

152
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what the Nintendo 64 one was.

153
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:47,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they just added one for the DS, which I don't know how the hell that would work, but I guess it will.

154
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,302
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else?

155
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:52,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other cool things I found out about it.

156
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:56,208
[SPEAKER_06]: You can sync Xbox 360 controllers and PlayStation 3 controllers to it.

157
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:56,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

158
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I have not gotten that to work correctly.

159
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:04,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed the Ouya controller, you were letting me kind of get a feel for it.

160
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:04,976
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that bad.

161
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:05,376
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad.

162
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:09,360
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that bothers me a slight little bit is just the shoulder buttons.

163
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,722
[SPEAKER_06]: The shoulder buttons just kind of feel weird because they're big and fat.

164
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:36,731
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I'm just it's a little strange to me but you know they work so I don't know it'll be all right but all the like the directional buttons and like I'm not even really you know big deal about the letters being different on there it doesn't you know they're the same colors as the Xbox 360 stuff so I just go by color anyway so I'm like okay I mean you you pick it up in like a second and that's it it's

165
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:37,271
[SPEAKER_06]: PS3, PS4, PS5

166
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't get both of them synced.

167
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:57,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

168
00:11:57,054 --> 00:12:01,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when I try to sync a PS3 controller to it, my Ouya controller becomes unsynced.

169
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:05,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's supposed to be able to just add it as a second controller, but I'm not doing something right.

170
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:06,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know what it is.

171
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:08,523
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a big deal.

172
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:11,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not something that's really officially supported anyway.

173
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:17,030
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, games, I've checked out some of the games on there, and they're pretty cool.

174
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I sideloaded Grand Theft Auto 3, which is... It works.

175
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:35,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played 3 on my phone, so I don't know how... Actually, I did play 3 on my iPod one time, but then I was like, this is way too big and it doesn't work very well with the touch control, so I deleted it.

176
00:12:36,118 --> 00:12:41,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked about Final Fantasy 3 specifically because I've played the DS version of that.

177
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:51,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I've emulated the NES one from way back in the day with the translation patch, but more recently I've played the iPhone, iPad version of it and the DS version, so I'm kind of curious how the Ouya one compares.

178
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:52,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's probably the same.

179
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:54,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's probably going to be very similar.

180
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:55,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if it's Android.

181
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:59,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember if Square released that on Android, but I wouldn't be surprised.

182
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they probably... It wouldn't surprise me.

183
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So I checked out... I've downloaded it.

184
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:06,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gotten a chance to play it.

185
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a game called The Ball, which is alright.

186
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,502
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a first-person puzzle game, similar to like...

187
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:16,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal or something like that, except without the portals.

188
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:21,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a game called Phase, which is also a little similar to Portal.

189
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:33,420
[SPEAKER_06]: You change the phase of your shield or whatever, and you can go between certain force fields, and if you have the opposite phase, those force fields are solid, so you have to

190
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Play with that mechanic and stuff.

191
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:43,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I played this Pengu poker game, which is something I'm probably reviewing soon.

192
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:44,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's pretty fun.

193
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:48,231
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of reminded me of... Oh, what was that?

194
00:13:48,352 --> 00:13:53,756
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like a poker RPG game that was on the iOS platforms.

195
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:55,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what that was called.

196
00:13:55,097 --> 00:14:00,101
[SPEAKER_06]: But Puzzle Poker... Swords and Poker, that's what it was.

197
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:17,491
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I played that you used to love the hell out of that game on iOS Sword to Poker is fun see this is not necessarily like that it's not an RPG or anything it's basically a combination of poker and bingo so you're making hands based on like you have so many cards and so you're making hands based on the way you'd score in bingo

198
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:25,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Clarify and comment from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com GameGuru says, Squeenix did release Final Fantasy 3 on the Amazon store, I believe.

199
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:26,344
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.

200
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:27,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

201
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:30,126
[SPEAKER_08]: If people are going to pay the $15 for it, go for it, right?

202
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I think they probably released it everywhere.

203
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:37,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so to try and wrap up, because this is only a three-hour show, you paid, what, $100?

204
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,491
[SPEAKER_08]: What was your donor level?

205
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:42,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So you paid $99 for this a year ago.

206
00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:43,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's your Ouya.

207
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:44,073
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you feel?

208
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:44,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Worth it?

209
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:46,995
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alright.

210
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:47,556
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright.

211
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:48,717
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little soon to tell.

212
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:52,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's kind of like a console that plays Xbox Live Indie games.

213
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:54,182
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it.

214
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:58,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're going to have some exclusive stuff eventually, which is alright.

215
00:14:58,326 --> 00:15:00,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in some of it, it's kind of like, whoo!

216
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:05,469
[SPEAKER_08]: With Microsoft clearly sunsetting that whole thing, unless we get surprised on the 24th.

217
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:06,909
[SPEAKER_08]: With Microsoft clearly sunsetting.

218
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:08,250
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great vision for the console.

219
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought of something.

220
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,090
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

221
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,310
[SPEAKER_03]: What this reminds me of.

222
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:10,990
[SPEAKER_08]: What the?

223
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,811
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of this looks-wise.

224
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:16,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying this to insult the machine.

225
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:27,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Aesthetically, it looks like those weird kind of blingy stuff that they give you at employee fairs when they open up your medical benefits and they try to give you stuff to advertise whatever the provider is.

226
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

227
00:15:47,901 --> 00:16:14,658
[SPEAKER_06]: some other things about the console it doesn't just do games of course it does you know other applications I mean you can pretty much load anything you want on it it's got Twitch on there right now so you can actually view Twitch streams and stuff through that it's got it's got a I don't know if it's Stitcher some radio thing I don't actually listen to a lot but I know I recognize the app I just don't listen to any of these radio apps except for like Pandora but it's

228
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:17,839
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a radio app on there, a music thing.

229
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:31,365
[SPEAKER_06]: And Minecraft worked great on it, except the controls don't work because right now they have the controls locked to just the... Well, the controller stuff, they have it locked to the Sony one that... What was it?

230
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,826
[SPEAKER_06]: The... What the fuck is that called?

231
00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:38,548
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sony... Remember their stupid... Almost like the PSP phone, but it wasn't the phone?

232
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:40,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

233
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:40,849
[SPEAKER_06]: The...

234
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:44,550
[SPEAKER_06]: and Xperia Play.

235
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:51,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have it locked to that and a future update is going to update it with controller support and I think it'll run.

236
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:59,493
[SPEAKER_06]: But it runs smooth because it has a touchpad on the actual controller so you can use that to click the buttons a little bit.

237
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:05,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also other apps I can get where I can map stuff to the buttons but I haven't bothered to try that yet.

238
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:11,079
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so during the break tonight here in studio in about an hour, we're going to plug that in real quick because it's really easy to set up, right?

239
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just HDMI and a power cord.

240
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,564
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we should be able to throw that in the TV real quick and during the break just kind of take a look at it because I'm dying to see what this is.

241
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:22,526
[SPEAKER_08]: The retail release of this is in what, June, supposedly?

242
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,268
[SPEAKER_06]: June 4th, supposedly, and they keep saying that they're not going to be late.

243
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:28,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're going to delay it, but right now they're saying June 4th.

244
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that like right before E3?

245
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:35,375
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an interesting time to... It is, but... That's so Saturn.

246
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:40,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing is, it's not something that really needs a huge fanfare because this is all a lot of these games.

247
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:45,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, everything's basically built by the community anyway.

248
00:17:45,102 --> 00:17:46,123
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be interesting.

249
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:47,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's stuff that they have.

250
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:50,006
[SPEAKER_06]: They have MMOs that have been ported over from it and stuff.

251
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,368
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can show you some of the apps on there.

252
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:54,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's apps coming on there every day.

253
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,630
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

254
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,290
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be neat.

255
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you sound pretty enthusiastic about it, even though you just said you're on the fence.

256
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:00,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that excited.

257
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:01,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, well, here's the thing.

258
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:04,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that... Like, this isn't going to be something I'm going to be playing all the time.

259
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:06,395
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be something I'll go back to every now and then.

260
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:12,777
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because now that I've gotten a little bit more comfortable with playing on PC with a lot of... Because I buy a lot of Steam crap.

261
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:14,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I buy a lot of Steam crap.

262
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,199
[SPEAKER_06]: You and everybody else.

263
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:16,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

264
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, especially when it's sale time.

265
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,901
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going in and actually starting to play a lot of that Steam crap that I bought.

266
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,402
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know...

267
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:24,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

268
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:25,423
[SPEAKER_06]: There's stuff I like on there.

269
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:28,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'll try to play around with it.

270
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:32,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Good question from True in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.

271
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:34,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the Ouya not run hot?

272
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:36,032
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they've got a big fan in the bottom.

273
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:37,573
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually like a fan vent in the bottom.

274
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:38,494
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably the heaviest part.

275
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:39,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, they have it weighted.

276
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:42,898
[SPEAKER_06]: They have it weighted on purpose so that it doesn't tip over when you plug the cords in the back.

277
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:43,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, smart.

278
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though it, I mean, yeah, you...

279
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,440
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

280
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:10,990
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you

281
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:29,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing a regular Mass Effect 3 stream on Thursday night.

282
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:55,827
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this whole streaming game thing has been kind of growing over the past couple of years, but I really feel like in the past couple of months, it's exploded.

283
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:58,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's doing game streams.

284
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:04,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's just very interesting to me that it's become so easy and so many people are doing it.

285
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,279
[SPEAKER_08]: All three of us have been doing game streams at certain times.

286
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:09,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby's been doing it.

287
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:11,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Even our listeners.

288
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:15,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I see a lot of the Twitter things like, come see my Twitch TV.

289
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:16,824
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so easy.

290
00:20:16,904 --> 00:20:22,168
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just gaming either because I've seen art streams.

291
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:23,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Podcast recordings.

292
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,571
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people who don't have a setup like the network or whatever do that.

293
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:35,677
[SPEAKER_03]: When Depeche Mode's album was about to come out, my friend Amanda, who does a lot of stuff for their official fan club, got to preview the album on a live stream.

294
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:41,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to basically do a live stream preview of the new album, play all the music on it.

295
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:42,501
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good.

296
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:43,262
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

297
00:20:44,102 --> 00:21:00,745
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah I think I honestly think it's good because I mean the thing that I always like is if it's a game that I've seen you know 50,000 times I like seeing people kind of rip it apart sort of do the MST3K thing which is pretty much what I do when I go stream is yell at people in the game who can't hear me

298
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:03,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw in chat says, yeah, which is why I love it.

299
00:21:03,651 --> 00:21:05,512
[SPEAKER_08]: So many games to watch people play.

300
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:08,154
[SPEAKER_08]: And what was the comment?

301
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:08,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

302
00:21:08,474 --> 00:21:13,318
[SPEAKER_08]: And Tiger Claw had started that off at our chat room saying, if only you could stream the Ouya on Twitch so we can see it.

303
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:17,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have the capture card for the TV yet, but that's on the list of want to get in future.

304
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:19,822
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my buddies sent me a link to a good one that she uses.

305
00:21:20,082 --> 00:21:20,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.

306
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:21,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll send it to you.

307
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:23,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting one event soon.

308
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:26,267
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll do HDMI capture soon.

309
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:30,025
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys missed a pretty good stream on I think it was Friday night.

310
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:30,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

311
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:32,126
[SPEAKER_08]: We were playing Mass Effect.

312
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:33,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And he didn't invite me.

313
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:34,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I had problems getting started.

314
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:36,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the whole thing was that Shane was going to get drunk.

315
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And it took him about 20 minutes.

316
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:41,872
[SPEAKER_08]: The stream lasted an hour.

317
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:43,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he passed out.

318
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:43,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

319
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:45,114
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was pretty funny.

320
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:47,796
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was a few that were there and got to see it.

321
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:49,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to do Wednesday Night Multiplayer.

322
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:50,517
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

323
00:21:50,537 --> 00:21:53,978
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to dance around all the live shows on the stream.

324
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So can I continue?

325
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:56,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm sorry.

326
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:59,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to talk about... I'm trying to promote your streaming site.

327
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor Shane.

328
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

329
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:15,704
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I've started doing that just because I don't... I get bored and usually... Sometimes it's Dan's day off, but a lot of times he'll have a Wednesday where he works late.

330
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:17,979
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I'm there by myself.

331
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,180
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the problem?

332
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hop on and chat with people and yell at video games.

333
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:27,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got an iCade.

334
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, and I saw you ordered yours.

335
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:34,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan ordered an iCade because Amazon has them for $44.

336
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:37,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're talking about marked down by about $100.

337
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:55,469
[SPEAKER_03]: so I went on a purchasing rampage trying to buy games that would work on it because I had none and it was pretty stupid of me because I spent like the last of my play cash on going to the baseball game last night too which was really good

338
00:22:56,061 --> 00:23:12,810
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got Pac-Man, the Atari's Greatest Hits I already had Fixed at Felix, but I can't figure out how to get it to work Metal Slug 3, the Midway Arcade, Blazing Star, and the Namco Arcade So I bought one game on the Namco Arcade, which was Galaga I tried playing Starblade with the arcade, and Starblade doesn't work

339
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:21,397
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these will have a one-day demo thing that you can play through unless you buy tokens or the full version of the game.

340
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And for most of these, the full version of the game is like a couple bucks.

341
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:27,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Slug 3 was about $5.

342
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:29,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It was worth it.

343
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:33,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought of another game that I think supports IK that you might not have.

344
00:23:33,308 --> 00:23:34,749
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Activision Collection.

345
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Kaboom is free on that.

346
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:38,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

347
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:39,754
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the games is free that you get with that.

348
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:39,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

349
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got plenty right now.

350
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:44,596
[SPEAKER_08]: When you told me the iKids were on sale, ordered one.

351
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:45,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

352
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:46,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm getting it Monday.

353
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:47,479
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited.

354
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:55,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I grabbed an app in the marketplace called Gridly a couple months ago, which is just the main emulator in disguise.

355
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,973
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know a lot of you guys are like, but emulators are bad.

356
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:02,414
[SPEAKER_08]: But I support the real deals too.

357
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:07,177
[SPEAKER_08]: But since there aren't a lot of real deals on iOS for these things, I can't wait.

358
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:12,461
[SPEAKER_06]: My cocktail cabinet with bar top is just collecting dust at my work.

359
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:17,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be real guys, are they ever going to put out Miss Nude World 96 as an app?

360
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:17,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I doubt it.

361
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:20,246
[SPEAKER_08]: It has Miss Nude World 96 on it too.

362
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:26,050
[SPEAKER_08]: The only way I will ever get to play Miss Nude World 96 is to turn to the dark side.

363
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Jamie.

364
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:28,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

365
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:33,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I actually, I'm probably going to be canceling WoW.

366
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:45,363
[SPEAKER_03]: because unless these bastards don't ever get back to me because I've been trying and trying and trying Ragnarok Online 2 went into free to play

367
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:47,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that and I thought of you this week on Steam.

368
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:48,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tried.

369
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:55,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had registered through whatever Gravity's new site is for it.

370
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now I can't register it through Steam.

371
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:07,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the same freaking problem that it had back with the old IRO was that you can't find the...

372
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:36,669
[SPEAKER_03]: installer anywhere and I tried to download from like one of their mirrors and it kept quitting on me so I'm like I could download the Steam one fine but I couldn't run it and so it says if you have problems email blah blah blah I'm like not replying to me yet so I don't know what to do so I'm really supremely pissed and I still need to update my PSO2 God I played something else I don't remember alright seriously then we'll go over to Loki Loki how was your gaming week

373
00:25:37,957 --> 00:25:38,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a few things.

374
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally installed Grand Theft Auto San... Well, I tried installing Ted Reyes on there.

375
00:25:46,864 --> 00:25:54,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got it to work, but mapping the buttons to the Xbox 360 controller are... It's pretty much impossible to get it to work correctly.

376
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,470
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of gave up on that.

377
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still trying to get my copy back from my sister, but she put it in storage.

378
00:26:02,034 --> 00:26:03,134
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to get it.

379
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:05,755
[SPEAKER_06]: What was she thinking putting your game in storage?

380
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:08,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I basically gave her the PlayStation 2.

381
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:10,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess siblings can get away with that a little more.

382
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:10,537
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

383
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:11,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not in a huge hurry to play Zandris.

384
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:12,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already played it.

385
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:18,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to play it on PC because I have it on PC, but I can't map the buttons correctly.

386
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,141
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a program to do it, but it doesn't work right, and you have to unpatch the game.

387
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:25,302
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a pain in the ass, so I'm just not worrying about that.

388
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:27,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I got four episodes from Liberty City on there.

389
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:28,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I played it for a little bit.

390
00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:33,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, cool, I'm going to play episodes from Liberty City and I'm going to play Deathmatch and I'm going to totally dominate Deathmatch.

391
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:36,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no one on fucking line anymore.

392
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:41,886
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nobody, nobody at all playing any sort of ranked Deathmatch or Deathmatch or anything.

393
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,806
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all fucking free mode.

394
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:52,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Free mode's fun, but I want to play a competitive game in Grand Theft Auto and I can't do that anymore because no one plays it.

395
00:26:52,608 --> 00:27:18,256
[SPEAKER_06]: which is why I need Grand Theft Auto V and it's such a fucking cock tease to have three fucking trailers and extended previews all over the goddamn internet I need this game, it's my crack I'm fiending for this game so yeah, Grand Theft Auto V is going to be awesome I can't wait to play it I guess I don't even need to ask about those trailers that came out this week and how you felt because I think you made it pretty clear

396
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:19,537
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic.

397
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:45,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, even there was like a 90-minute kind of talking about it because basically everyone was shown like about 30 minutes of gameplay that talked everything about from the mechanic between switching between each protagonist in the game and how they're, you know, the map is about five times the size of Red Dead Redemption, one and a half times of Red Dead Redemption's worth in the ocean.

398
00:27:46,554 --> 00:28:09,479
[SPEAKER_06]: under the ocean actually so there's a lot of scuba diving in the game um you can pretty much do whatever i mean you can do whatever you want in the game but it's just so much to explore it's just gonna it's gonna be awesome um and just a lot of mechanics in the game sound really good like the heists and how you have to do missions to kind of do recon on different things and set up the actual heists and you hire your people to help you out and

399
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,773
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks like a very good game.

400
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:16,214
[SPEAKER_06]: And a very good storyline going along with that.

401
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:17,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Actual games to play.

402
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:22,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Saints Row III, I'm still trying to go through and finish off my achievements that don't involve co-op.

403
00:28:23,317 --> 00:28:29,399
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just getting so bored with a lot of these games that I don't know what I want to play anymore.

404
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:32,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I can't think of anything that I want to play that sounds exciting.

405
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,662
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like Grand Theft Auto V. I can't think of anything other than Saints Row IV and Grand Theft Auto V and maybe Earth Defense Force 2025.

406
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:38,803
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

407
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:41,464
[SPEAKER_06]: None of those are coming out yet.

408
00:28:42,004 --> 00:28:46,888
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm kind of in this weird position where I'm just kind of going on autopilot and playing stuff.

409
00:28:48,502 --> 00:28:50,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really want to play, but I'm kind of playing it anyways.

410
00:29:11,234 --> 00:29:13,757
[SPEAKER_06]: The Cars Don't Realize That The Bridge Was Up

411
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:35,950
[SPEAKER_06]: That almost inspired me to even bring my singing voice and do a Buggy Saints Row the Third.

412
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,571
[SPEAKER_08]: That is begging for the Benny Hill theme.

413
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:41,411
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just seriously like, what?

414
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:42,732
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so terrible.

415
00:29:42,952 --> 00:29:45,172
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even a mission I had to do where I had to stop this.

416
00:29:45,312 --> 00:29:46,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's an assassination mission.

417
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,853
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to kill this guy before he kills him.

418
00:29:48,973 --> 00:29:51,233
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to commit suicide by jumping off the bridge.

419
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:56,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she needs to collect the money, insurance money, but it's null and void if he commits suicide.

420
00:29:56,914 --> 00:29:57,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

421
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:17,710
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

422
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:42,133
[SPEAKER_06]: My safe house and just starts shooting at me.

423
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:44,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, how the fuck did this guy even get here in the first place?

424
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:48,096
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not even supposed to be coming after me yet because I don't have the right outfit on.

425
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:49,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't even found this guy.

426
00:30:49,356 --> 00:30:50,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just ridiculous.

427
00:30:50,597 --> 00:30:56,199
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I know people have their opinions on you and your strong opinions about Nintendo and other things.

428
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:02,182
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it's amazing to me how when you really like a game, you will make that game last forever.

429
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:05,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I've bought it on two platforms already.

430
00:31:05,283 --> 00:31:05,964
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

431
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:06,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've

432
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:08,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

433
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:14,318
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, and then beyond that, Ouya, I played lots of games on the Ouya, and we talked about a lot of those already.

434
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:18,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else did I play this week?

435
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,501
[SPEAKER_06]: More Call of Duty.

436
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:23,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually am playing through a little bit more of the story campaign on 3, which is, it's alright.

437
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:25,744
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's Call of Duty.

438
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:28,366
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have a great story.

439
00:31:28,426 --> 00:31:29,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's cinematic.

440
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:30,587
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of fun.

441
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,108
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't play Call of Duty for the story.

442
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:33,109
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you don't really.

443
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,169
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't really play for the story.

444
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:34,870
[SPEAKER_06]: You play for the action.

445
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,191
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just watching like an action movie.

446
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:36,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

447
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:41,452
[SPEAKER_06]: and MinecraftXPLA because we did a VOG gaming night.

448
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:42,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually had someone show up this time.

449
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:43,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.

450
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:44,874
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

451
00:31:45,114 --> 00:31:45,614
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

452
00:31:45,814 --> 00:31:48,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I really wanted to go, but I had to work on one of my other projects that night.

453
00:31:48,855 --> 00:31:49,355
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

454
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,395
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're doing Forza this week, right?

455
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:51,716
[SPEAKER_06]: This week we're doing Forza Horizon.

456
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:52,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be there.

457
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:53,276
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully that will bring out more people.

458
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:53,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be there.

459
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:56,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza Horizon this Thursday, 8 p.m.

460
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:56,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Pacific time.

461
00:31:57,018 --> 00:31:58,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably goes for about two hours.

462
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:00,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least that's how long I can play.

463
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:01,640
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

464
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:19,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura Croft's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Good times with it?

465
00:32:39,366 --> 00:32:40,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Death isn't super frustrating in that game.

466
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:00,063
[SPEAKER_03]: and it starts you pretty much right from the section you left off on.

467
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:00,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

468
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:03,206
[SPEAKER_03]: But I need to find the picture on my Tumblr and post it in chat for everybody.

469
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:03,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

470
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:06,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Live.VogNetwork.com My Gaming Week.

471
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:09,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try to be kind of quick here because I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

472
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:11,453
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I spent a lot of time playing some old stuff.

473
00:33:11,613 --> 00:33:13,875
[SPEAKER_08]: A virtual console on Wii U. Go figure.

474
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:14,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I've...

475
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:17,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually bought a lot of stuff on it.

476
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:18,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of embarrassed to say.

477
00:33:19,238 --> 00:33:21,879
[SPEAKER_08]: But Mega Man, the old school Mega Man came out this week.

478
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:23,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And how could I not?

479
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,961
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mega Man games have some of the best soundtracks.

480
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:29,662
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to check it out on Virtual Console.

481
00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:35,664
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm loving the whole restore points are a godsend in stages like Iceman's stage.

482
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:40,306
[SPEAKER_08]: That stage can go to hell for those blocks that appear and disappear.

483
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:43,787
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I've been having a good time with that.

484
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:51,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, there's another game, but DarkSakura's going to bring it up later in the show, so I'll wait to get my comments on that until later.

485
00:33:53,251 --> 00:34:02,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And, oh, I was on Steam randomly last night, and I was looking at the free-to-play games, and I was going to do Ragnarok Online 2, but I decided instead to play Puzzle Pirates.

486
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember Puzzle Pirates?

487
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:05,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that the other day.

488
00:34:05,636 --> 00:34:07,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh, that's on Steam?

489
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:07,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

490
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:08,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, right?

491
00:34:08,538 --> 00:34:08,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet.

492
00:34:09,018 --> 00:34:10,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, God, that took me back.

493
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,701
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like, we all played that.

494
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:15,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, that's what we used to play when we were all playing DDR regularly.

495
00:34:15,725 --> 00:34:17,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, a ton of us were playing Puzzle Pirates.

496
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:18,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember, like, Irene got us all into that.

497
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:18,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play it at the time.

498
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:22,112
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I was actually, during those days, I was playing Ragnarok Online on...

499
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:41,225
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's the bilging is still the same freaking thing with the match but they've added a lot to it like you have rooms you customize and it's definitely like a game that they put out there for more lower-end PCs you could probably play puzzle pirates just fine on like a netbook like is that kind of game so yeah I was that was kind of fun to just kind of get back into that again

500
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:50,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, World of Warcraft, Mass Effect 3, a lot of the usual suspects, and another game that I'm going to be reviewing on VOG soon, so stay tuned for that.

501
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:54,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's get into some gaming news.

502
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:57,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick, plugs for the Twitters, the Facebooks, and all that.

503
00:34:57,276 --> 00:34:59,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLRs, where you can follow us on Twitter.

504
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:02,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

505
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,121
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't really have a whole lot else to add.

506
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:07,262
[SPEAKER_08]: We may not be here Memorial Day weekend.

507
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:11,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I may be gone, but we'll let you know in the next couple weeks.

508
00:35:11,765 --> 00:35:14,286
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay tuned for all that live programming information.

509
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:16,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's talk about the gaming news.

510
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:17,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, start us off tonight.

511
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:20,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so apparently the Wii U has now been hacked.

512
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:37,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least the mod chip creators behind the Wii Key they have now said that they've claimed to, I guess, compromise Wii U security and completely reverse the Wii U drive authentication, disk encryption file system, and everything else.

513
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:40,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And

514
00:35:41,272 --> 00:36:02,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I guess what's supposed to come of this is that they're going to either create a replacement optical drive that'll go into your Wii U, or they're going to create some sort of... Like, I've seen this before with some of the Xbox 360 drives, where they'll have a daughter board or something like that that replaces a board on there, and you can just kind of hook in the ribbon cables, and it's a bypass or something.

515
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:04,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll have something like that.

516
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:08,969
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Wii key... Actually, the Wii key, I want to say... No, that's not the mod chip I have in my Wii.

517
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:09,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have a...

518
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:12,973
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

519
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:29,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And kind of show, I guess, how serious that this is.

520
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:32,555
[SPEAKER_06]: They've also dumped their first game, Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth.

521
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:34,616
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the probably most terrible games out there.

522
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:48,605
[SPEAKER_06]: But they have dumped it and it's... Well, somebody's dumped it and it's been released out there on the internet to download and do nothing with because there's no such mod ship to play it on yet.

523
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:49,865
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

524
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:52,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Nintendo is aware of it.

525
00:36:52,947 --> 00:37:05,036
[SPEAKER_06]: They say that they're going to find a way to bypass everything, but thus begins the back and forth struggle that is hacking and patching, more hacking and more patching, so on and so forth.

526
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:09,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And so far, there's really no homebrew needs of this.

527
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:13,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess maybe you can make your own software for the Wii U, but this is mainly piracy.

528
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:16,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Hacker's gonna hack.

529
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:18,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Or backups, I guess, if you will.

530
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:19,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.

531
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:24,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I think the real question to ask here, though, is how hard is this to pull off?

532
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the harder it is, the less impact this is gonna have.

533
00:37:27,952 --> 00:37:35,396
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that the pirates and the people that are all about wanting to steal games as much as they... Oh, excuse me, make backups as fast as they can.

534
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,817
[SPEAKER_08]: They're always gonna find a way in.

535
00:37:37,077 --> 00:37:40,679
[SPEAKER_08]: But the question is, how easy is it for somebody else...

536
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:43,601
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be like a mod chip.

537
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:50,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to have to buy a mod chip, you're going to have to install the mod chip onto your system or install some sort of part on your system.

538
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:59,391
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't like the Wii Homebrew channel where it was a hack that modified your dashboard to run a program that you could then run games off a hard drive.

539
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:00,472
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that simple.

540
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:02,113
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to buy a mod chip.

541
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:06,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Can Nintendo brick your console with a firmware update if you were running this?

542
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,315
[SPEAKER_06]: They may threaten to do that.

543
00:38:08,395 --> 00:38:09,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they can.

544
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:15,737
[SPEAKER_06]: There's drive emulators and stuff like that that are already out there.

545
00:38:15,757 --> 00:38:17,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't they do it?

546
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,779
[SPEAKER_08]: My point is, why would Nintendo play softball with this?

547
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:22,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

548
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of false positives is what it is.

549
00:38:26,562 --> 00:38:36,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you have someone that legitimately hasn't done anything and you fuck their console up, they're already in not a very strong position with their console to piss people off like that.

550
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:44,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they're probably going to let this thing get released, get people to buy the console because they're like, oh, I'm going to hack all this stuff up and then patch it.

551
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:45,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

552
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:48,234
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, okay, that's smart.

553
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:49,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what I would think that they would do.

554
00:38:49,855 --> 00:38:56,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm sure at the same... How many people went and got a PSP the day they heard that NES emulators are runnable on it?

555
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:03,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and then, well, on top of that, though, they're probably going to be, you know, prompted if this does come out, you know, pretty widespread.

556
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:11,131
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be prompted by their third-party developers that, hey, we need you to fix this because we're not making a lot off of these Wii games already.

557
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:16,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we're making even less now because people are pirating them, you know, it's going to be a tough thing.

558
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:20,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I mean, here's the other thing you gotta consider too.

559
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:28,708
[SPEAKER_06]: These aren't necessarily DVDs that they're running on anymore, so you're gonna have to have a Blu-ray burner and Blu-ray media to do that.

560
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:30,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that stuff's coming down.

561
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,791
[SPEAKER_08]: That stuff's coming way down.

562
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:35,395
[SPEAKER_08]: We're only a couple years away from that being standard, really, for PCs.

563
00:39:35,868 --> 00:39:51,994
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, if anything, I could see them go on the route of, like, the X-Key or something, where it's basically a drive, a middle, you know, kind of in the middle board that allows you to run, it'll emulate the drive, and you'll run stuff off a hard drive.

564
00:39:52,395 --> 00:39:55,476
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be easy like that, is the way I see it, that they're gonna do it.

565
00:39:56,036 --> 00:39:58,617
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, I mean, it's progress, I guess.

566
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:06,401
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they've completely reversed the file system and stuff, who's to say that they can't come up with their own, like, modified dashboard that'd run on there?

567
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:10,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if they've figured out how to, you know, do the file system stuff and then the keys for that.

568
00:40:10,723 --> 00:40:14,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and the hacking community is going to have an interesting case to make, too.

569
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,487
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I understand why they wanted to do Homebroom Channel.

570
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:18,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Homebroom?

571
00:40:18,647 --> 00:40:35,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Homebrew channel on Wii because there wasn't a lot of indie friendly stuff on the Wii but Wii U is really trying to make a case like we are the indie friendly platform you've even heard the indie developers come out and say yeah like Wii U is gonna like I know this is gonna shock people but Nintendo's the platform to be on right now if you're indie

572
00:40:36,238 --> 00:40:43,843
[SPEAKER_08]: So does the hacking community have as much of a case when it seems like Nintendo is really embracing a lot of the homebrew stuff open arms?

573
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:58,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I shouldn't say homebrew, but indie stuff open arms, thus negating the need for a homebrew channel that is totally clean and without piracy.

574
00:40:58,694 --> 00:41:03,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't think that they're really going to... It's just one hacking group doing something, and that's it.

575
00:41:04,158 --> 00:41:05,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to have people that want to...

576
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,361
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in the business of selling mod chips, so they're going to want to make a mod chip to sell.

577
00:41:09,562 --> 00:41:11,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wii U is just the console of the moment.

578
00:41:11,283 --> 00:41:13,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as soon as PlayStation 4 is out, they'll be working on that too.

579
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:14,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, yeah.

580
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:15,586
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

581
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:23,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Loki alluded to this a minute ago, and I was mentioning this earlier in the show when they were teasing me about the Wii message light being on.

582
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:29,495
[SPEAKER_08]: But Nintendo actually sent a message to all the Wii owners this week saying, hey, have you checked out the Wii U?

583
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:32,957
[SPEAKER_08]: So it seems odd to me that it took them this long to do it.

584
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:35,359
[SPEAKER_08]: But they did send a message to everybody that says, quote,

585
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:39,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know that you can play nearly all of your existing Wii games on Wii U?

586
00:41:40,383 --> 00:41:45,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you could play every Wii game on Wii U. Why did they say nearly all?

587
00:41:45,847 --> 00:41:48,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're counting like, you know, maybe Virtual Console and stuff.

588
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:51,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there some stuff that you can't quite port over?

589
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:52,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there was something that didn't transfer over.

590
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:54,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just something to save their ass if something doesn't work.

591
00:41:55,855 --> 00:41:56,295
[SPEAKER_08]: It's possible.

592
00:41:56,455 --> 00:41:57,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, yeah, it's true.

593
00:41:57,717 --> 00:42:06,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Your Wii controllers and many Wii accessories can also be used with the new Wii U console, along with any downloaded games, save data, and other info stored in your existing Wii console.

594
00:42:06,687 --> 00:42:09,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Wii U is the all-new home console from Nintendo.

595
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:10,551
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just an upgrade.

596
00:42:11,251 --> 00:42:16,137
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an entirely new system that will change the way you and your family experience games and entertainment.

597
00:42:17,093 --> 00:42:18,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you hear that, Jimmy Fallon?

598
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:19,273
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just an upgrade.

599
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:21,454
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big problem, though.

600
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:22,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, think about it.

601
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:27,875
[SPEAKER_06]: If they have to go out there and tell people, hey, guys, it's not just a peripheral.

602
00:42:27,975 --> 00:42:28,615
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an upgrade.

603
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:32,616
[SPEAKER_06]: They've done a poor job marketing it, then.

604
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:38,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that and maybe this is a case now where the name issue is finally biting Nintendo.

605
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:43,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of people razzed them for the Wii name, and that ended up working.

606
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:43,878
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't matter.

607
00:42:43,898 --> 00:42:44,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo did great with that.

608
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:46,058
[SPEAKER_08]: But this whole Wii U name...

609
00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:53,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I think maybe Nintendo's wondering, I don't know if they are, but I think a lot of people are going, maybe that really wasn't the best name.

610
00:42:53,182 --> 00:42:59,745
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have started off calling it the U. Or, well, Super Wii, which isn't that what they call it in Japan?

611
00:43:00,425 --> 00:43:01,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that translates to Super Wii?

612
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:02,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that?

613
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:09,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, yeah, Koopa Kid Jeremy in our chat right there says, this just proves they should have called it something else.

614
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:11,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

615
00:43:12,072 --> 00:43:12,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Agree.

616
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:31,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, what I think is interesting about this also, Iwata, Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata, said in a financial results briefing last week that, quote, we have not been able to solidly communicate the product value of Wii U to our consumers yet, which has been a grand challenge for us.

617
00:43:31,747 --> 00:43:39,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Some have the misunderstanding that Wii U is just Wii with a pad for games, and others even consider Wii U GamePad as a peripheral device connectable to Wii.

618
00:43:39,991 --> 00:43:43,173
[SPEAKER_08]: We feel deeply responsible for not having tried hard enough...

619
00:43:43,573 --> 00:43:45,434
[SPEAKER_08]: to have consumers understand the product.

620
00:43:45,774 --> 00:43:48,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Have they done the commercial onslaught that they did with Wii?

621
00:43:48,355 --> 00:43:51,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I remember all those commercials, Wii would like to play, and that whole thing.

622
00:43:51,516 --> 00:43:52,836
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a pretty good marketing plan.

623
00:43:53,036 --> 00:43:55,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they do that at all?

624
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:58,898
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a new marketing campaign going on right now that's really dumb.

625
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:11,902
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically these families coming in, and they're like bussing them in by, or vanning them in, whatever, taking them by a van, and bring them to Nintendo headquarters to try the Wii U out for the first time, and

626
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:13,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, oh my god!

627
00:44:13,843 --> 00:44:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo stuff is so awesome!

628
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,424
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the best thing ever!

629
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:21,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this gamepad is so amazing!

630
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:22,985
[SPEAKER_06]: This is gonna change it all!

631
00:44:23,426 --> 00:44:30,348
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, seriously, just wanna... Okay, if Nintendo really wants to get their message across about the Wii U, here's what they need to do.

632
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:36,910
[SPEAKER_08]: They're gonna need to release a Mario soccer game this Christmas, and they need to take it out across America...

633
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:48,436
[SPEAKER_08]: to all the little peewee soccer championships so all their target audience, the moms and dads of the soccer kids can play Mario soccer and then they can all gossip amongst themselves and get the word out.

634
00:44:48,776 --> 00:44:50,937
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how Nintendo reaches their core audience, right?

635
00:44:51,337 --> 00:44:51,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Soccer games.

636
00:44:53,198 --> 00:44:53,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Eh?

637
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:54,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowling!

638
00:44:55,936 --> 00:45:05,083
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is you had people that were really excited about the Wii, like myself, and bought it because it was a very innovative product at the time.

639
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:09,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, we wish it was kind of like graphics of the Xbox 360 and PS3.

640
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:10,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in it for the donuts.

641
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:16,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you bought it, and then you're like, hmm, I'm not playing anything on it.

642
00:45:17,653 --> 00:45:18,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought these Mario games.

643
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:20,467
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

644
00:45:41,597 --> 00:45:43,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Game's a game in this case, yes.

645
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:44,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's fantastic.

646
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you know, the developers are so behind, you know, the Wii and stuff.

647
00:45:48,683 --> 00:45:53,767
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they thought it was so great that they decided, hey, EA said, hey, you know what?

648
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:56,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to put out FIFA on this system every year.

649
00:45:57,089 --> 00:46:01,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's not going to be a different FIFA, but it'll be the same FIFA every year.

650
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:04,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, we don't want to put any money into it.

651
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:04,695
[SPEAKER_08]: That's different.

652
00:46:04,755 --> 00:46:06,757
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't blame Nintendo for what EA did.

653
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Konami decided, hey, you know what, we're gonna do Pro Evo.

654
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:11,561
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't blame him for that either.

655
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:12,664
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it with soccer games?

656
00:46:12,724 --> 00:46:13,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

657
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:22,058
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be like me blaming Microsoft for all those terrible rehashes in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade.

658
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:23,338
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't Microsoft's fault.

659
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:24,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you blame them for all the shovelware on the Wii?

660
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:27,820
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

661
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:38,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying there wasn't... The Wii U, the step from the Wii or like, you know, previous generation, the GameCube to the Wii, there was a big jump as far as gameplay innovation, stuff like that.

662
00:46:39,725 --> 00:46:40,285
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

663
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:03,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo Land was not Wii Sports

664
00:47:20,074 --> 00:47:23,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo Land wasn't Wii Sports, and I don't think it was a system seller.

665
00:47:24,116 --> 00:47:25,477
[SPEAKER_08]: A big, big chunk of people.

666
00:47:25,497 --> 00:47:28,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like this is a very deja vu conversation, so we need to move on here a minute.

667
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,620
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like Wii Sports Nintendo version or something.

668
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,881
[SPEAKER_08]: So many people that bought the Wii were not buying the Wii.

669
00:47:34,262 --> 00:47:35,222
[SPEAKER_08]: They were not buying the Wii.

670
00:47:35,242 --> 00:47:38,144
[SPEAKER_08]: They were buying Wii Sports and the console that came with it.

671
00:47:38,724 --> 00:47:40,525
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a big chunk of people that bought the Wii.

672
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:42,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

673
00:47:59,484 --> 00:48:23,324
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know I would bowl like I would bowl you know it was very natural for people but then going to Nintendo Land it's like well it's not that different well this is kind of similar what I've already done in the Wii but why do I need to spend the extra money to play this game that's very similar to what I already have that's the problem it wasn't just it wasn't a big hook that got people in that gamepad was not enough hook to get people onto the system

674
00:48:23,672 --> 00:48:28,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if they'd put out a game, like, you know, the thing about Wii Sports is that everybody generally knows those sports.

675
00:48:28,714 --> 00:48:29,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody knows bowling.

676
00:48:31,015 --> 00:48:38,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically within Wii Sports, that bowling minigame, maybe the tennis to an extent too, but those two games specifically were just huge.

677
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:42,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe Nintendo Wii U needed something, it needed that.

678
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:48,744
[SPEAKER_08]: for, or still needs, still come out this Christmas, needs something like that that everybody just knows.

679
00:48:48,904 --> 00:48:54,409
[SPEAKER_08]: You know bowling, you know, but you don't necessarily know Donkey Kong Crash Course or F-Zero.

680
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:55,770
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't necessarily know that stuff.

681
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:00,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why, but my mind goes to like maybe a board game or a card game thing.

682
00:49:01,034 --> 00:49:04,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if you could like play it online or something, but that would require Nintendo to...

683
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:13,134
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, for the Wii U, I think what they would need to have done is done something completely different than the Wii.

684
00:49:13,275 --> 00:49:13,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Like,

685
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:15,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

686
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:17,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Come up with... I can't really think of what they would have to do.

687
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Here you go.

688
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,182
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw says, Too bad Wii Sports didn't have online multiplayer.

689
00:49:21,222 --> 00:49:22,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucks playing by yourself against the computer.

690
00:49:22,823 --> 00:49:23,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Kabam.

691
00:49:23,604 --> 00:49:25,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Wii Sports 2 online.

692
00:49:25,705 --> 00:49:30,889
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing with the Wii though, what they're pushing though is that it's a family party atmosphere is what it is.

693
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:33,430
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not the dynamic anymore.

694
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,452
[SPEAKER_06]: That used to be the dynamic when it was like...

695
00:49:36,132 --> 00:49:36,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

696
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:57,438
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

697
00:49:57,538 --> 00:50:01,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably do more gaming with Shane in Kansas than anybody else.

698
00:50:01,562 --> 00:50:02,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

699
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:04,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Like distance isn't a thing anymore, really.

700
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:10,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you talk to people, you probably talk to people more that are like further away than you do like your neighbors and stuff.

701
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not the thing.

702
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:12,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the thing.

703
00:50:12,672 --> 00:50:17,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't, like the Wii, you know, it was kind of fun playing the Wii stuff, but it was all party game stuff.

704
00:50:18,257 --> 00:50:21,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't see myself getting the Wii U because, hey, now five people could play.

705
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:22,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

706
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have five people in my house ever.

707
00:50:24,662 --> 00:50:24,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

708
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:29,265
[SPEAKER_08]: YYR with a valid counter statement in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

709
00:50:29,566 --> 00:50:33,289
[SPEAKER_08]: The audience for Wii Sports probably didn't care that much about online play.

710
00:50:34,813 --> 00:50:40,238
[SPEAKER_08]: True, but hear me out here a minute, YYR, because you have that camera on every Wii U console.

711
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:49,027
[SPEAKER_08]: What if Grandma could play bowling with her grandkids, thanks to the internet technology, and every Wii U could have Skype built in?

712
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:49,448
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome.

713
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:56,555
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be amazing, but Nintendo's sitting on that goldmine, and that's not what they want to do, for some reason.

714
00:50:56,795 --> 00:50:58,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of me also thinks, though, that...

715
00:51:24,508 --> 00:51:35,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had this view of Nintendo as sort of the traditionalist in how social should be and the fact that they actually want to get people together in the same room

716
00:51:37,523 --> 00:51:39,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing in-person gaming.

717
00:51:39,944 --> 00:51:43,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it almost seems to me that they've got an agenda to encourage that.

718
00:51:44,465 --> 00:51:45,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.

719
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:48,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see them changing off of that anytime really soon.

720
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:53,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to go back to, like, real quick, you know, because that does make sense that that may be their agenda.

721
00:51:53,907 --> 00:51:58,608
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you got to go to the movie Joe Dirt, where there's the guy with, you know, the firework stand.

722
00:51:58,868 --> 00:52:01,949
[SPEAKER_06]: And all he has is sparklers and those little snakes.

723
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:24,271
[SPEAKER_06]: and he's like but that's what I like but you can't just think about what you like or what your focus may be you have to think about other people out there I understand that may be the focus that you want people to game in the room but you know what would be awesome too is say you want to have that gaming experience but you can't get your friends over you know say that you know they're gone somewhere and you want to play with them anyways think about all the options

724
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:28,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Koopa Kid Jeremy in our chatroom says, keep grandma off the internet.

725
00:52:29,294 --> 00:52:32,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Old people opening 90 tabs, all of them yahoo.com.

726
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:35,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, why did your friend Billy send me this link?

727
00:52:35,979 --> 00:52:37,980
[SPEAKER_08]: What is two girls, one cup?

728
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,720
[SPEAKER_08]: What is this?

729
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,021
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's actually hilarious?

730
00:52:40,582 --> 00:52:44,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's grandmother is super into the internet.

731
00:52:44,524 --> 00:52:45,425
[SPEAKER_03]: She does her genealogy.

732
00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:47,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's my dad.

733
00:52:47,085 --> 00:52:47,665
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my dad.

734
00:52:48,026 --> 00:52:48,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.

735
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:58,128
[SPEAKER_03]: She's probably one of the most computer literate people in her age group that did not start off in programming or engineering that I know.

736
00:52:58,768 --> 00:53:00,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty neat to watch her.

737
00:53:00,308 --> 00:53:06,390
[SPEAKER_03]: However, my maternal grandmother, she will like poke around a little bit and maybe look at Facebook and then that's it.

738
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,750
[SPEAKER_03]: My granny's like, no, those things, I don't want to look at them.

739
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:12,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Your daddy's going to mess with that, not me.

740
00:53:13,342 --> 00:53:14,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Kathy Griffin and Cher And Anderson Cooper

741
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:41,272
[SPEAKER_08]: They all need to do a buddy comedy.

742
00:53:41,592 --> 00:53:46,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we have distanced ourselves way away from the original topic, which means next topic, DarkSakura.

743
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:48,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, it's my turn, isn't it?

744
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,319
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it, Rob, making me work.

745
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:54,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a little game called Fire Emblem.

746
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:59,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is actually for Fire Emblem.

747
00:53:59,884 --> 00:54:03,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire Emblem Awakening Summer Scramble is the new DLC.

748
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:07,810
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out in North America and Europe, but they have censored a scene

749
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:14,874
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a character named Tharja who, I guess she's like pulling at her underwear or something or pulling it up.

750
00:54:15,554 --> 00:54:27,941
[SPEAKER_03]: But the edit that they made to it makes it even worse because there's like a piece of cloth now, like a curtain or something that's flowed in between where her butt is.

751
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:34,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all you see is like, if you weren't looking for the little strap on the side, it would look like she's got her hands in her ass.

752
00:54:34,385 --> 00:54:34,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

753
00:54:35,718 --> 00:54:37,359
[SPEAKER_03]: She's digging her fingers in.

754
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,261
[SPEAKER_08]: She's self-muppeting.

755
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:42,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

756
00:54:42,464 --> 00:54:44,225
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to work on more conversations.

757
00:54:44,645 --> 00:54:45,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that on Urban Dictionary?

758
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:47,848
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be, though.

759
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:49,690
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, it's just...

760
00:54:52,398 --> 00:54:58,923
[SPEAKER_03]: The only, okay, and this is my big thing about censorship, is that the only reason this shit's a big deal is because you make it a fucking big deal.

761
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:06,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like the approach I take to, quote, foul language around kids.

762
00:55:07,989 --> 00:55:12,412
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you're not supposed to say the words, that's just going to make it all the more attractive to say it, you know.

763
00:55:12,953 --> 00:55:15,755
[SPEAKER_03]: If you act like it's not a big deal, to them, it's not a big deal.

764
00:55:16,616 --> 00:55:21,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Same goes with, you know, censorship of, you know, a woman pulling up her underwear.

765
00:55:22,757 --> 00:55:24,838
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that they edited this... It's a bathing suit.

766
00:55:25,078 --> 00:55:25,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

767
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:27,980
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

768
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:36,885
[SPEAKER_03]: What they did to this, it just makes it look even worse because when you give somebody a clear concrete picture, it leaves a little room to the imagination.

769
00:55:37,245 --> 00:55:38,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Like black bars.

770
00:55:38,366 --> 00:55:38,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

771
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:40,087
[SPEAKER_08]: We did this in college.

772
00:55:41,108 --> 00:55:46,691
[SPEAKER_08]: We were making a music video and we had the guy stand out in just a pair of gym shorts.

773
00:55:47,091 --> 00:55:51,094
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we did the movie, we put a black bar over it because it was supposed to be the girls...

774
00:55:52,234 --> 00:55:53,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I talking about this on the show?

775
00:55:53,436 --> 00:55:58,901
[SPEAKER_08]: We did like a Spice Girls music video for a college project and at the end of the video the girls Shut up!

776
00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:04,387
[SPEAKER_08]: The girls steal his clothes and so at the end he's just standing there with a black bar over it.

777
00:56:04,407 --> 00:56:09,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Well he didn't get naked for us he was wearing gym shorts and we put the black bar over it and it looked like he was naked!

778
00:56:09,572 --> 00:56:10,653
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an illusion!

779
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:14,296
[SPEAKER_08]: And your pervy little minds don't think, oh, he's wearing gym shorts.

780
00:56:14,336 --> 00:56:17,918
[SPEAKER_08]: They think, oh, they had to block his penis.

781
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:23,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's like you can also... Here's a good example of the Austin Powers movie, the first one.

782
00:56:23,803 --> 00:56:24,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God, yes.

783
00:56:24,883 --> 00:56:25,604
[SPEAKER_08]: With the cantaloupe.

784
00:56:25,624 --> 00:56:26,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

785
00:56:26,545 --> 00:56:31,088
[SPEAKER_03]: But she had, like, red pasties over the jumblies.

786
00:56:32,229 --> 00:56:33,410
[SPEAKER_03]: To steal Mystique's word.

787
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:34,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

788
00:56:35,211 --> 00:56:44,540
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, when you take away the concrete image and you put just something in front of it, it's going to leave a lot more to the imagination.

789
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:55,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the end, I think it's going to, you know, probably be more unintentionally explicit.

790
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:59,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the brain, if it can be porned, the brain will porn it.

791
00:56:59,453 --> 00:56:59,874
Yeah.

792
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:08,547
[SPEAKER_06]: and two, since I worked in a classy reference to Joe Dirt in the last topic, I'm going to reference Bioshock Infinite in this one.

793
00:57:08,847 --> 00:57:12,730
[SPEAKER_06]: The mind of the subject will desperately struggle to create memories where none exist.

794
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:17,093
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, they will undress the bitch when they can't see her clothes.

795
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:19,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And also think of the children.

796
00:57:19,995 --> 00:57:20,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Think of the children.

797
00:57:23,496 --> 00:57:25,217
[SPEAKER_08]: How many children are playing Fire Emblem?

798
00:57:25,257 --> 00:57:27,078
[SPEAKER_08]: How many children can understand Fire Emblem?

799
00:57:27,098 --> 00:57:27,859
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 3DS game.

800
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:29,940
[SPEAKER_08]: All of the children are playing Fire Emblem.

801
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:33,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I say that and then I'm like, oh, wait a minute, Rob.

802
00:57:33,543 --> 00:57:37,005
[SPEAKER_08]: When you were 10, you were totally playing Final Fantasy.

803
00:57:37,986 --> 00:57:42,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another fun example because Prince Brightstar mentioned the black bars in Japan.

804
00:57:42,849 --> 00:57:50,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when we got Final Fuck X and it was all squared out, the pixelated?

805
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:52,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, we know that's badge.

806
00:57:55,818 --> 00:57:58,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we need to switch topics stat, Loki.

807
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,262
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, that was entirely hilarious.

808
00:58:01,703 --> 00:58:02,964
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just cosplay porn.

809
00:58:02,984 --> 00:58:06,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there wasn't even any male characters that were dressed up like Final Fantasy characters.

810
00:58:06,788 --> 00:58:07,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good cosplay, though.

811
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:09,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

812
00:58:11,412 --> 00:58:16,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so there was a game that came out called Scribblenauts Unlimited.

813
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And they keep adding stuff each year.

814
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:21,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this year they added some memes.

815
00:58:22,285 --> 00:58:29,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And to go along with that, Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat were some of the characters featured in the game.

816
00:58:30,554 --> 00:58:31,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what?

817
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:32,216
[SPEAKER_06]: They're copyrighted.

818
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:39,464
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently Fifth Cell or Warner Brothers didn't really give a shit or just were blatantly unaware that things get copyrighted on the internet and that kind of stuff.

819
00:58:40,064 --> 00:58:41,546
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

820
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:47,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, the creators of those two properties are a little pissed off.

821
00:58:47,433 --> 00:58:48,875
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have filed a lawsuit.

822
00:58:49,856 --> 00:58:56,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, apparently, neither Fifth Cell or Warner Brothers were even acknowledging it.

823
00:58:56,344 --> 00:58:57,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of like, eh.

824
00:58:59,984 --> 00:59:22,079
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know they it's just some internet kids and you know they do um you know they obviously they do support the fact that people make things on the internet for non-profit stuff and that's fine but this is clearly for profit it was something that they advertised the game saying hey look Nandcat's in there and Keyboard Cat you should buy this game and people like oh cool I'm gonna buy the game because of that

825
00:59:24,362 --> 00:59:28,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just like the Nintendo version had Mario and Luigi in it, and they had to work out that deal with Nintendo.

826
00:59:28,324 --> 00:59:30,285
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they're not in the PC version, right?

827
00:59:30,705 --> 00:59:31,305
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very similar.

828
00:59:32,145 --> 00:59:33,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of think a lot of this is ignorance.

829
00:59:35,227 --> 00:59:37,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think the developers meant to do this maliciously.

830
00:59:37,768 --> 00:59:38,788
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think that's even malicious.

831
00:59:38,948 --> 00:59:42,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they just thought, oh, Nyan Cat's like this 4chan thing.

832
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:45,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody really owns it, so let's just lift it.

833
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:46,650
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be funny for our game.

834
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:58,813
[SPEAKER_08]: But now that WB, the parent company, is not returning these guys' phone calls, who, yeah, it is a trademark thing or whatever, now they're pissed off, and this is their warning shot to get noticed.

835
00:59:59,133 --> 01:00:01,114
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll get settled out of court, as these things always do.

836
01:00:02,074 --> 01:00:03,295
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

837
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... And Keyboard Cat's a little trickier.

838
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:30,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of think that's just thrown in for good measure.

839
01:00:30,952 --> 01:00:35,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that has quite the legal... Well, they also have Long Cat and stuff, I think, are in the game.

840
01:00:36,193 --> 01:00:37,514
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think anybody owns Long Cat.

841
01:00:37,534 --> 01:00:39,154
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.

842
01:00:39,754 --> 01:00:42,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I want to know if My Body is Ready is in there.

843
01:00:44,216 --> 01:00:50,578
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what that does... My Body is Ready is not a noun, though, so... Did I say a noun?

844
01:00:50,638 --> 01:00:51,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I did.

845
01:00:51,138 --> 01:00:51,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Neon.

846
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:52,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Neon.

847
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:04,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there are a number of memes out there that are under copyright.

848
01:01:04,615 --> 01:01:09,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that they're well within their right to pursue action.

849
01:01:10,438 --> 01:01:15,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially, I really, and this is maybe just a guilty pleasure.

850
01:01:16,342 --> 01:01:18,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I love seeing the big companies taken down a notch.

851
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:19,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

852
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's a lot of people quick to defend Scribblenauts and stuff.

853
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:26,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not that I'm anti-Scribblenauts or I want to see Scribblenauts.

854
01:01:26,242 --> 01:01:27,343
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I love Scribblenauts.

855
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,585
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cute game and so forth.

856
01:01:28,705 --> 01:01:32,791
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also like the internet culture and a lot of what the internet brings up.

857
01:01:32,871 --> 01:01:33,332
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually...

858
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of these meme things, I really like to see how it turns around some people's lives.

859
01:01:38,202 --> 01:01:42,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about that chick, Ain't Nobody Got Time For That, when she was on the local news.

860
01:01:43,244 --> 01:01:45,165
[SPEAKER_08]: She's got commercial deals now.

861
01:01:45,245 --> 01:01:46,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Antoine.

862
01:01:47,085 --> 01:01:50,147
[SPEAKER_08]: That guy, there was a really interesting development with him this week.

863
01:01:50,367 --> 01:01:54,248
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, for all practical purposes, he did a lot with his stuff too.

864
01:01:54,308 --> 01:01:57,090
[SPEAKER_08]: They're clamming in your windows, they're snatching people up.

865
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:02,952
[SPEAKER_08]: They milk their 15 minutes of fame, and it ends up being a happy ending of sorts.

866
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think that Queen Simeon and Chad is right.

867
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:07,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Keyboard Cat is copyrighted or trademarked.

868
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:08,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

869
01:02:08,196 --> 01:02:15,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, well, the guy, actually, I remember watching an interview where he licensed out his cat's likeness for the pistachio commercial.

870
01:02:16,021 --> 01:02:16,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

871
01:02:16,962 --> 01:02:21,766
[SPEAKER_08]: But the cat in Scribblenauts doesn't really look like it, like Nyan Cat does.

872
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:26,269
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be considered enough derivative, but I think copyright laws, what, 50% change?

873
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:28,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that would be the harder one to prove.

874
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:31,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and also the fact that you sum it by typing Keyboard Cat.

875
01:02:33,846 --> 01:02:34,346
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

876
01:02:34,366 --> 01:02:38,009
[SPEAKER_08]: But one could argue, well, it is a cat at the keyboard.

877
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:38,570
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

878
01:02:39,591 --> 01:02:41,072
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a cat that's neon.

879
01:02:42,573 --> 01:02:44,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want my body as ready to be in there.

880
01:02:45,253 --> 01:02:46,014
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a noun.

881
01:02:46,634 --> 01:02:49,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Reggie Fils-Aimé could be in there in the Nintendo version.

882
01:02:49,496 --> 01:02:52,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet if you type that in, the only thing that happens is his jaw comes out.

883
01:02:52,818 --> 01:02:54,279
[SPEAKER_08]: The game just punches you in the face.

884
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,000
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what happens.

885
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Or starts printing money.

886
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,263
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, 4chan the game.

887
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:00,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Ain't nobody got time for that.

888
01:03:00,924 --> 01:03:05,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that's what Scribblenauts kind of like was its big selling point, was that it had all these memes in it.

889
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:08,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, those stupid guys that were sitting behind us at the baseball game?

890
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:09,791
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, foul ball!

891
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't nobody got time for that!

892
01:03:11,232 --> 01:03:11,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

893
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:12,972
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

894
01:03:34,617 --> 01:03:35,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Greenheart Games is the folks behind it.

895
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:58,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And they did this interesting thing to kind of combat piracy, which I guess was some type of experiment or whatever.

896
01:03:59,391 --> 01:04:09,974
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they did is they put up a copy of the game on one of the big torrent sites and with a little info file that you'd see with most cracked games that says, you know, fully cracked, playable, da da da.

897
01:04:10,574 --> 01:04:20,416
[SPEAKER_08]: But in an old throwback to, let's say, the Earthbound pirate copies of many years ago, it would change the game significantly to make it unbeatable.

898
01:04:20,876 --> 01:04:22,157
[SPEAKER_08]: How does it change the game?

899
01:04:22,698 --> 01:04:27,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, at some point, piracy starts taking over your game development office.

900
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:36,269
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll get a little message that pops up on the screen that says, It seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally.

901
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:40,372
[SPEAKER_08]: If players don't buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.

902
01:04:40,452 --> 01:04:41,893
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to click on a little frown to continue.

903
01:04:42,173 --> 01:04:43,815
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't beat the game at this point.

904
01:04:45,016 --> 01:05:08,218
[SPEAKER_08]: and of course it has all these people posting on internet forums about it like how do I get the piracy to stop in the game which is just giving away how many people were pirating it very similar as well to didn't they do this with Arkham Asylum not City but Asylum they had like a whole thing where Batman couldn't make a certain jump and people were posting on forums about this and WB just went ban ban ban ban because these were all the people

905
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they were pirating it.

906
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:20,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, this guy was collecting anonymous usage statistics and found that it was, what, over 90% of the copies of this being played were pirated.

907
01:05:21,402 --> 01:05:21,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy.

908
01:05:22,622 --> 01:05:31,524
[SPEAKER_06]: But were those people going to actually play the game legitimately in the first place or did they just find it when they were browsing new games that are added to the Pirate Bay?

909
01:05:31,784 --> 01:05:37,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he put it out there himself on the Pirate Bay and people were downloading it.

910
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:48,534
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's not forget that other indie companies have put out their game on the Pirate Bay to drive up interest in the game and to, you know, get people to test the game out.

911
01:05:49,295 --> 01:06:00,143
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's my thing is, I wonder, I'm not saying someone could fuse that for this, I'm sure that people are just pirating, but you can't attribute, if you didn't do that...

912
01:06:01,164 --> 01:06:01,825
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

913
01:06:16,824 --> 01:06:18,505
[SPEAKER_06]: And now all these people are writing stories about it.

914
01:06:18,886 --> 01:06:20,387
[SPEAKER_06]: And now he has a legit version out there.

915
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:22,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And now everyone's like, oh, we've got to support the Indies.

916
01:06:22,428 --> 01:06:25,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go buy this game, even though you may or may not want to play it.

917
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:33,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, either way you slice this pie, Loki, whether you want to say it was the piracy mechanism or the exposure, genius move.

918
01:06:35,498 --> 01:06:41,442
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter which way you slice it, whatever angle they were... Either it was a genius anti-piracy scheme or it was a genius marketing scheme.

919
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:48,547
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not very honest in the fact that, you know, basically they're... It's kind of like, I wouldn't say like entrapment almost.

920
01:06:48,707 --> 01:06:53,051
[SPEAKER_08]: The irony of you saying entrapping pirates is not very honest.

921
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,111
[SPEAKER_08]: The irony.

922
01:06:54,351 --> 01:06:55,032
[SPEAKER_08]: It hurts.

923
01:06:55,312 --> 01:06:56,133
[SPEAKER_08]: It's burning.

924
01:06:57,073 --> 01:06:58,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I need ice cubes.

925
01:06:59,055 --> 01:07:03,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel less sorry about a company that puts their game up there by themselves...

926
01:07:03,938 --> 01:07:06,299
[SPEAKER_06]: versus a game getting leaked to the internet.

927
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:07,719
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you going to say, Jamie?

928
01:07:07,759 --> 01:07:08,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I had to make my point.

929
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Breakman was saying using Pirate Bay as your game testers.

930
01:07:14,981 --> 01:07:17,902
[SPEAKER_08]: It does end up being kind of like a demo of sorts.

931
01:07:17,922 --> 01:07:22,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, cool.

932
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,724
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, cool that people are checking out the game.

933
01:07:26,328 --> 01:07:29,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that's what they wanted in the end, and hopefully it works out for them.

934
01:07:30,812 --> 01:07:32,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally am not going to pick up this game.

935
01:07:32,573 --> 01:07:40,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It may have been, you know, the fact that it's compared to Game Dev Story, it's a little similar to that, might be intriguing, but after what they did, fuck them.

936
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not buying it.

937
01:07:41,821 --> 01:07:42,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not playing it either.

938
01:07:42,661 --> 01:07:45,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are personally offended by this little move?

939
01:07:45,223 --> 01:07:46,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it's shady.

940
01:07:46,484 --> 01:07:47,385
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so shady.

941
01:07:47,665 --> 01:07:48,566
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, like...

942
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:53,710
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a difference between... But the Pirate Bay is shady.

943
01:07:53,930 --> 01:08:02,777
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a difference between putting something in your game, you know, like the Michael Jackson game on DS.

944
01:08:02,877 --> 01:08:03,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the Vuvuzela thing.

945
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:04,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody just brought that up in chat.

946
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Or like Batman stuff.

947
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Programming a little thing in there to catch pirates when the game gets leaked out.

948
01:08:10,643 --> 01:08:11,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's something.

949
01:08:11,804 --> 01:08:14,286
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool that they've got that in there and you can catch people doing it.

950
01:08:14,626 --> 01:08:18,469
[SPEAKER_06]: But the fact that you go, Oh, we're going to show these pirates.

951
01:08:18,489 --> 01:08:19,410
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to upload our own...

952
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:20,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on, that's stupid.

953
01:08:20,831 --> 01:08:26,234
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like saying, oh, I'm going to open up my house and I'm going to say, hey, come steal my shit.

954
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And then get pissed off that people are stealing my shit.

955
01:08:29,636 --> 01:08:31,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, that's just stupid.

956
01:08:31,657 --> 01:08:32,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid.

957
01:08:32,257 --> 01:08:34,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And you think you're going to teach these people moral?

958
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:41,583
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those things like, to say that this is going to work in getting people to buy your game is just like those stupid advertisements before.

959
01:08:41,923 --> 01:08:43,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about the lighting rig people.

960
01:08:43,924 --> 01:08:46,966
[SPEAKER_06]: They're out of jobs because you pirate your movies.

961
01:08:48,567 --> 01:08:50,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, it's just stupid.

962
01:08:50,588 --> 01:09:01,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's say we're about ready to put out a CD of exclusive Orange Lounge Radio material and things that, you know, never before heard on the show and that's how we're going to pay for our hosting for the next year.

963
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:02,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Hypothetical situation.

964
01:09:02,594 --> 01:09:10,719
[SPEAKER_08]: How do I make sure that that CD does not get pirated without possibly offending the pirates out there in the world?

965
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:11,399
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't.

966
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,121
[SPEAKER_06]: It's music.

967
01:09:14,141 --> 01:09:14,941
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to be able to.

968
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:16,362
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no DRM that you can put on that.

969
01:09:16,716 --> 01:09:18,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So, bend over and take it.

970
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:19,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And enjoy it.

971
01:09:21,025 --> 01:09:25,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it out there for free yourself and just hope they'll rally behind you because you're one of them.

972
01:09:26,718 --> 01:09:27,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Most likely, here's the thing.

973
01:09:27,939 --> 01:09:32,462
[SPEAKER_06]: The situation with that is you're not going to have a whole lot of interest in people putting it up.

974
01:09:32,542 --> 01:09:42,347
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to leak it out there because they just don't... They figure that if there's no interest in trying to get the game, they're not going to necessarily put it out there or the content.

975
01:09:42,728 --> 01:09:48,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for example, I can't find copies of maybe somebody VHS recording...

976
01:09:50,012 --> 01:09:51,353
[SPEAKER_06]: episodes of Being Bobby Brown.

977
01:09:51,674 --> 01:09:53,375
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just not on the internet at all.

978
01:09:53,575 --> 01:10:00,062
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife is wanting me to search high and low and I will until the day I die to find copies of that.

979
01:10:00,482 --> 01:10:01,383
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just not up there.

980
01:10:01,403 --> 01:10:05,767
[SPEAKER_08]: For Being Bobby Brown, I will endorse piracy because everybody has to see that.

981
01:10:05,947 --> 01:10:06,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby!

982
01:10:07,428 --> 01:10:13,612
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic, but Whitney was a bitch and she fucking had her lawyers take all that shit down.

983
01:10:13,632 --> 01:10:15,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means babe in total control of herself.

984
01:10:15,553 --> 01:10:15,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

985
01:10:16,573 --> 01:10:21,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And she had everybody take the copies off the internet.

986
01:10:21,076 --> 01:10:23,978
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the clips, too, are just gone.

987
01:10:24,478 --> 01:10:26,879
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unfortunately, there's that.

988
01:10:26,979 --> 01:10:29,901
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just don't think anyone would pirate our CD.

989
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:33,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure, they could leak it out there, but is anyone really going to care to download it?

990
01:10:34,243 --> 01:10:34,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

991
01:10:36,005 --> 01:10:45,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe my example about music was a bad one, but when it comes to games, you had Tim here on the show last night whose job is in the industry making games like Tomb Raider.

992
01:10:45,993 --> 01:10:54,541
[SPEAKER_08]: What is an effective DRM strategy that we can do to make sure that as many games as possible sell legitimately so people like Tim can continue to be employed?

993
01:10:54,901 --> 01:10:55,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Free-to-play.

994
01:10:55,681 --> 01:10:58,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you basically... Everything's gotta go free-to-play.

995
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:00,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's gotta go free-to-play.

996
01:11:01,004 --> 01:11:08,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not saying free-to-play to the point of, you know... It doesn't have to necessarily be free-to-play, like cheap-to-play, I guess.

997
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:11,469
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like $10 games with a ton of DLC.

998
01:11:11,629 --> 01:11:17,451
[SPEAKER_06]: DLC that makes sense, not just, oh, you're out of energy points, you gotta buy some DLC to be able to play this game longer.

999
01:11:17,831 --> 01:11:20,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Not anything retarded like that, but actually supported DLC.

1000
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:27,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, the game might be shorter because it's more of a demo, but that's what I'm saying.

1001
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:28,916
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically you get a small amount of content.

1002
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:36,600
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, Ridge Racer for the Vita would have worked perfectly like that, except they charged $40 for it, or $30 for four tracks.

1003
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,240
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.

1004
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:42,103
[SPEAKER_06]: If they put it out for like $5 or $10, probably like $5 would be perfect.

1005
01:11:42,203 --> 01:11:43,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby's retort in chat.

1006
01:11:43,563 --> 01:11:44,084
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fair one.

1007
01:11:44,104 --> 01:11:44,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to put it out there.

1008
01:11:45,064 --> 01:11:46,905
[SPEAKER_08]: This was an $8 game, and it was still pirated.

1009
01:11:48,226 --> 01:11:48,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a game.

1010
01:11:50,988 --> 01:11:51,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that.

1011
01:11:51,649 --> 01:11:55,372
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be an $8 game, but once again, they put it out there first.

1012
01:11:55,392 --> 01:11:58,254
[SPEAKER_06]: They put it out there.

1013
01:11:58,334 --> 01:12:01,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Would an $8 game be leaked that quickly?

1014
01:12:01,636 --> 01:12:02,337
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the question.

1015
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:06,140
[SPEAKER_06]: How quickly would an $8 indie game be leaked out to the internet?

1016
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:09,382
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people who leak games just because they can.

1017
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:10,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that they can.

1018
01:12:10,903 --> 01:12:16,346
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's DRM on it, I'm assuming it's DRM free, but let's assume that there was DRM on it.

1019
01:12:16,446 --> 01:12:21,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Would really someone spend the time to crack this game and put it out there?

1020
01:12:21,428 --> 01:12:23,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure, there's probably somebody out there that would do it.

1021
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:29,193
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know if it's going to have as big of a draw once now it's all controversial.

1022
01:12:29,913 --> 01:12:30,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Steam so much.

1023
01:12:30,493 --> 01:12:30,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

1024
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:00,515
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the thing.

1025
01:13:00,836 --> 01:13:07,497
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to find that balance between how much do I charge for it and make sure enough people buy it so that I recoup my cost.

1026
01:13:07,537 --> 01:13:11,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems also double-edged sword, too, because now there's games that come out on PC.

1027
01:13:11,658 --> 01:13:16,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I might think of buying Bioshock Infinite on PC as well as on 360.

1028
01:13:16,379 --> 01:13:21,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I already have the 360 version, but I may buy it on PC.

1029
01:13:21,161 --> 01:13:22,601
[SPEAKER_06]: But am I going to pay full price for it?

1030
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:34,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck no, I'm gonna wait for a sale because they have sales all the damn time on Steam, on Amazon, on Green Man Gaming, on Gamefly with Steam DRM, on, you know, wherever.

1031
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:38,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna find these games for, you know, marked down to, like, nothing.

1032
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:43,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the kind of mentality, I mean, look at Tomb Raider, it was just half price.

1033
01:13:43,376 --> 01:13:45,558
[SPEAKER_06]: That came out, like, two months ago?

1034
01:13:45,878 --> 01:13:46,378
[SPEAKER_06]: A month ago?

1035
01:13:46,398 --> 01:13:46,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1036
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, shit, you can't do this with console games.

1037
01:13:50,944 --> 01:13:52,186
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not dropping that fast.

1038
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:56,031
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to be five bucks one day and then next day... Well, some do.

1039
01:13:56,833 --> 01:14:01,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, some do, but I'm talking about Tomb Raider, a game that sold quite a bit.

1040
01:14:01,379 --> 01:14:03,522
[SPEAKER_06]: It was totally not a disappointment to anybody, but I'm...

1041
01:14:05,204 --> 01:14:07,985
[SPEAKER_08]: GameGuru in chat says, well, I believe DRM is rather stupid.

1042
01:14:08,306 --> 01:14:11,008
[SPEAKER_08]: What the game dev tycoon guys did was actually pretty clever.

1043
01:14:12,509 --> 01:14:16,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakman says, dev equal, I'll give you $20 to go buy this $10 game.

1044
01:14:16,471 --> 01:14:17,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki equal, fuck that.

1045
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:18,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I'll have to go out of my way.

1046
01:14:18,973 --> 01:14:19,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to pirate it.

1047
01:14:22,615 --> 01:14:23,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't pirate games anymore.

1048
01:14:25,718 --> 01:14:27,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't pirate games to, you know,

1049
01:14:29,096 --> 01:14:31,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe to play them early and then buy the game.

1050
01:14:31,097 --> 01:14:32,278
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't pirate them any less?

1051
01:14:32,818 --> 01:14:34,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I don't pirate them any less.

1052
01:14:34,419 --> 01:14:38,521
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't pirate PC games anymore, for sure.

1053
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:41,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe to play them a little early, yes.

1054
01:14:41,942 --> 01:14:42,883
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do buy them always.

1055
01:14:44,534 --> 01:14:45,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1056
01:14:59,565 --> 01:15:08,630
[SPEAKER_06]: But if a game gets leaked out that's supposed to be out in a couple months, and I can play it way early, I'm all about playing games as soon as I can.

1057
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:15,013
[SPEAKER_06]: If Grand Theft Auto 5 gets leaked out tomorrow, you better believe I'm going to find a way to get it.

1058
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:17,975
[SPEAKER_06]: But you better believe I'm going to be buying it when it comes out.

1059
01:15:18,095 --> 01:15:18,776
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1060
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:39,476
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1061
01:15:55,373 --> 01:16:19,126
[SPEAKER_06]: that was a hack on Uplay but there are some other stuff that gets leaked out I think from duplicators or game you know they go to retail early because they street date stuff and they ship to the retailer like a week early and so then that gets leaked out by some employee but then there's like the Microsoft games that come out a month ahead time and I'm assuming that's duplicators because I can't see how the hell it could leak any earlier than that

1062
01:16:19,466 --> 01:16:21,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm sure we'll get some emails on this at a later date.

1063
01:16:21,967 --> 01:16:35,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, mailbag at orangeonsradio.com I do actually want to say there's been a couple cases where I've downloaded PC games through a torrent site because the servers were down for the actual site and I had a key to play it.

1064
01:16:35,729 --> 01:16:36,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

1065
01:16:36,609 --> 01:16:40,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, especially if you play Ragnarok online, sometimes it's the only way to get it.

1066
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:42,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on with more news.

1067
01:16:42,951 --> 01:16:44,291
[SPEAKER_08]: We're running long, so DarkSakura.

1068
01:16:45,737 --> 01:16:46,998
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let me get it.

1069
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:56,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there is, for people who are fans of Eternal Darkness, there is a spiritual successor called Shadow of the Eternals that's been announced.

1070
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:12,880
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, there's already a bunch of information out on it saying that it's going to be out on PC and Wii U and that they are trying to score 1.5 million to fund the game.

1071
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's going to be interesting.

1072
01:17:19,814 --> 01:17:25,237
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm not seeing is if it's a Kickstarter or not out yet for that.

1073
01:17:25,317 --> 01:17:31,281
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are wanting to do it episodic and have it out by Q3 2014.

1074
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:31,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1075
01:17:31,942 --> 01:17:32,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1076
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:41,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people I know on Twitter are not big fans of this idea.

1077
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:47,805
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as Eternal Darkness was awesome, apparently the guy who made it, Dennis Dyack, hasn't made a lot of winners.

1078
01:17:48,306 --> 01:17:50,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're not sure if this is something worth supporting.

1079
01:17:50,307 --> 01:17:51,327
[SPEAKER_08]: But he'll get the money.

1080
01:17:51,447 --> 01:17:58,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it looks like it's going to be produced through Precursor Games.

1081
01:17:59,812 --> 01:18:01,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Canadian group.

1082
01:18:01,933 --> 01:18:03,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Good games are coming out of Canada.

1083
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:10,743
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming a little bit sooner than things that are getting kick-started right now.

1084
01:18:11,244 --> 01:18:12,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, start us off with the U.S.

1085
01:18:12,585 --> 01:18:13,645
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing coming up this week.

1086
01:18:15,507 --> 01:18:16,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, nothing.

1087
01:18:17,408 --> 01:18:17,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1088
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:18,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

1089
01:18:18,809 --> 01:18:19,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a damn thing?

1090
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:26,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing until the 14th, and 14th will be Metro 20, or not 23, Metro Last Light on the 14th.

1091
01:18:26,274 --> 01:18:26,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that?

1092
01:18:26,774 --> 01:18:28,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that just because it's a slow time of year?

1093
01:18:28,836 --> 01:18:30,657
[SPEAKER_08]: They figure everybody's seeing Iron Man?

1094
01:18:30,797 --> 01:18:32,839
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a slow time of the year, usually.

1095
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:41,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually there's still quite a few releases coming out, but I think we're getting that pre-console launch lull, and so we don't have a lot of games coming out.

1096
01:18:41,945 --> 01:18:49,390
[SPEAKER_06]: There was supposed to be the Wii U version of Deus Ex Human Revolution, but that is now TBA, so...

1097
01:18:51,031 --> 01:18:51,451
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

1098
01:19:08,397 --> 01:19:09,538
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1099
01:19:30,927 --> 01:19:36,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Week is actually, from what I understand, kind of hard to sell anything because nobody's there.

1100
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:39,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Week is when you go home to visit your family.

1101
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:42,951
[SPEAKER_03]: This week would be, I think, a lot busier for sales.

1102
01:19:44,132 --> 01:19:45,272
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1103
01:19:45,512 --> 01:19:48,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have a very few things in the UK.

1104
01:19:48,774 --> 01:19:58,477
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 9th, we have Sid Meier's Ace Patrol, and the 10th, Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut for Wii U, and Persona 4, the ultimate in Mayonaka Arena.

1105
01:19:59,844 --> 01:20:02,285
[SPEAKER_03]: for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1106
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:05,306
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure our buddy Magi is very happy about that.

1107
01:20:05,826 --> 01:20:07,427
[SPEAKER_03]: As he told me earlier that he was happy.

1108
01:20:07,607 --> 01:20:10,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he said after he wrote us that letter that he found out it was coming out.

1109
01:20:12,169 --> 01:20:12,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1110
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:14,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And the new Shin Megami Tensei.

1111
01:20:15,523 --> 01:20:16,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1112
01:20:38,869 --> 01:20:39,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Madden 25

1113
01:20:56,974 --> 01:20:58,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Out this year, right?

1114
01:20:58,615 --> 01:20:58,915
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 years.

1115
01:20:59,415 --> 01:21:00,375
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 sequels to Madden.

1116
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:00,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1117
01:21:01,676 --> 01:21:10,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've actually... I mean, there was... On one of the boxes, they even said... Credits him for the Madden games.

1118
01:21:10,859 --> 01:21:13,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's just nothing.

1119
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,761
[SPEAKER_06]: No sort of royalties or anything.

1120
01:21:15,801 --> 01:21:17,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though he was a co-creator of the series.

1121
01:21:17,722 --> 01:21:17,862
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1122
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:20,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1123
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:21,611
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like he has a pretty strong case.

1124
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:24,053
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be interesting to see if it gets settled out of court or not.

1125
01:21:24,393 --> 01:21:25,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it will.

1126
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:28,396
[SPEAKER_06]: It says it's going to trial, so you never know.

1127
01:21:29,197 --> 01:21:30,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because it goes to trial.

1128
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:31,038
[SPEAKER_08]: First day of the trial.

1129
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:32,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he reached an agreement.

1130
01:21:32,139 --> 01:21:32,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Go figure.

1131
01:21:34,417 --> 01:21:36,118
[SPEAKER_08]: That happened to me once when I was on jury duty.

1132
01:21:36,178 --> 01:21:39,299
[SPEAKER_08]: We were sitting in the little hallway waiting to go in the room.

1133
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:40,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even know what the case was about.

1134
01:21:40,559 --> 01:21:41,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know if it was criminal, civil, what.

1135
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:46,541
[SPEAKER_08]: We're sitting in the hallway waiting to go in the room, and then we're sitting there for like an hour, an hour and a half.

1136
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:50,863
[SPEAKER_08]: They come out and say, oh, they just settled, so we're going to have you guys all go back to the jury room.

1137
01:21:51,743 --> 01:21:52,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've had that happen before too.

1138
01:21:52,863 --> 01:21:54,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, okay.

1139
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:56,865
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a game of chicken.

1140
01:21:57,905 --> 01:21:58,865
[SPEAKER_08]: How far are we going to go?

1141
01:21:58,885 --> 01:22:00,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we actually going to get the jury in here?

1142
01:22:00,346 --> 01:22:01,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, jury duty is great.

1143
01:22:01,646 --> 01:22:03,127
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like your chance to sit and read a book.

1144
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Jury duty is not so bad.

1145
01:22:05,569 --> 01:22:09,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's just this particular county because here in Sacramento it's just one day or one child.

1146
01:22:09,732 --> 01:22:12,254
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have really decent snacks in the cafeteria.

1147
01:22:12,815 --> 01:22:14,096
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's super important.

1148
01:22:14,436 --> 01:22:19,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a friend that was in our WoW guild because we were both on jury duty.

1149
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:29,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're sitting in the hallway freaking talking about our Draenei and how we were looking forward to seeing what the new expansion was and we're all so disappointed.

1150
01:22:30,014 --> 01:22:30,354
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.

1151
01:22:30,554 --> 01:22:35,101
[SPEAKER_08]: The last time I was on jury duty, I was playing...

1152
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:43,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say it was Final Fantasy 4, the after years, but wasn't that only on Wii at the time?

1153
01:22:43,927 --> 01:22:45,629
[SPEAKER_08]: So it must have just been Final Fantasy 4.

1154
01:22:45,689 --> 01:22:47,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's when the DS cartridge came out.

1155
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:48,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet that's what it was.

1156
01:22:48,491 --> 01:22:51,114
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was playing the crap out of that at jury duty.

1157
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:54,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember being so bored sitting at home.

1158
01:22:55,073 --> 01:23:09,365
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't because I was actually working at that other place but I went in for my jury duty and it gave me a chance to read my book and get my stuff done and I sadly didn't get picked for a jury because I kind of wanted to be on one so I could have the people's court theme going in my head.

1159
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:11,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I sat on one in 2006.

1160
01:23:11,846 --> 01:23:15,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on a nice long murder trial.

1161
01:23:15,107 --> 01:23:16,167
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you don't.

1162
01:23:16,227 --> 01:23:17,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful what you wish for.

1163
01:23:17,088 --> 01:23:19,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on a two-week trial for a criminal case.

1164
01:23:20,049 --> 01:23:23,790
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't murder, but it was very bad stuff.

1165
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:25,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I got to do my civic duty.

1166
01:23:26,191 --> 01:23:28,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I got to see Law & Order play out in front of me.

1167
01:23:28,972 --> 01:23:33,174
[SPEAKER_08]: The very animated prosecutor was awesome to watch.

1168
01:23:33,214 --> 01:23:37,035
[SPEAKER_08]: She was great, but I never want to be on a trial like that again in my life.

1169
01:23:38,356 --> 01:23:43,300
[SPEAKER_03]: But I actually don't mind the waiting for it just because it gives me a chance to read.

1170
01:23:44,581 --> 01:23:45,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow, how do we get on jury duty?

1171
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:49,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it must be... Video games and jury duty!

1172
01:23:49,645 --> 01:23:53,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's legal week here on OLR because guess what my story is about?

1173
01:23:53,368 --> 01:23:54,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Another lawsuit!

1174
01:23:55,109 --> 01:24:00,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is one of those, oh, we must have seen this coming after all the internet rage about Mass Effect 3.

1175
01:24:00,473 --> 01:24:01,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when somebody tried to sue there.

1176
01:24:02,275 --> 01:24:04,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what game got targeted this time?

1177
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:04,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Alien Skyrim!

1178
01:24:05,157 --> 01:24:34,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Colonial Marines, that's right Sega and Gearbox class action lawsuit against them saying you knowingly misrepresented Aliens Colonial Marines at trade show demos fascinating and a lot of people were bitching about this too like the game that came out did not match what they were showing at E3 and all this so but I don't know like can you sue a movie because the movie wasn't as good as the trailer and they put stuff in the trailer all the time that doesn't end up in the real movie

1179
01:24:37,074 --> 01:24:37,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know though.

1180
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:44,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I would like, you know, the two hours of my life back for Mortal Kombat Resurrection or whatever the crap it was.

1181
01:24:45,219 --> 01:24:47,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And I totally blame Jessica and Ross for making me watch that.

1182
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I blame Ross for making me watch that movie.

1183
01:24:49,962 --> 01:24:56,365
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't go demand, you know, that people give me money or anything for a shitty movie.

1184
01:24:57,766 --> 01:25:02,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I pretty much know shit anyway, but the trailers made it look a lot more interesting than it actually was.

1185
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:03,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the sequel to the first one.

1186
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:05,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually really boring and stupid.

1187
01:25:06,141 --> 01:25:10,143
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow, TimeGate Studios, maybe they can see this coming.

1188
01:25:10,203 --> 01:25:15,806
[SPEAKER_08]: The end is coming because, of course, they are the developer behind Aliens, Colonial Marines, co-developer.

1189
01:25:16,226 --> 01:25:17,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And they also developed a game called Section 8.

1190
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:26,771
[SPEAKER_08]: They filed for bankruptcy protection at the Texas Southern Bankruptcy Court, apparently owing their creditors between $10 and $50 million in debt.

1191
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:28,352
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a hell of a price range.

1192
01:25:28,372 --> 01:25:30,033
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very odd estimate.

1193
01:25:30,373 --> 01:25:50,326
[SPEAKER_08]: but yeah, TimeGate seeking protection against creditors now granted they aren't the target of this lawsuit per se but yeah don't release a game as bad as Aliens Colonial Marines people because in this day and age you'll get sued over it how dare you waste my time

1194
01:25:53,143 --> 01:25:54,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, $60 for a game.

1195
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:55,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big chunk of change.

1196
01:25:56,064 --> 01:26:02,446
[SPEAKER_06]: And also they had, you know, all the media that was from it was from the, you know, pre-release thing.

1197
01:26:02,526 --> 01:26:04,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was nothing like ads development goes.

1198
01:26:05,507 --> 01:26:09,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hey, yeah, we had to scale back this stuff because it wouldn't run on a console.

1199
01:26:10,529 --> 01:26:14,050
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, let's travel to a time when things were a lot simpler.

1200
01:26:16,131 --> 01:26:16,991
[SPEAKER_08]: To the intro of our show.

1201
01:26:17,011 --> 01:26:18,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a new theme back in the day.

1202
01:26:18,932 --> 01:26:21,773
[SPEAKER_08]: When we first started the show this evening, before we started...

1203
01:26:23,485 --> 01:26:24,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Long, long time ago.

1204
01:26:24,989 --> 01:26:25,992
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple hours.

1205
01:26:26,533 --> 01:26:31,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then, we weren't talking about Final Fuck X. We were just talking about, you know, blowjobs.

1206
01:26:31,285 --> 01:26:31,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1207
01:26:37,073 --> 01:26:38,814
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the classic game of the week.

1208
01:26:39,154 --> 01:26:45,717
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, back in the day, you would buy a game like, I don't know, what was it?

1209
01:26:45,737 --> 01:26:46,117
[SPEAKER_08]: E.T.

1210
01:26:46,197 --> 01:26:47,378
[SPEAKER_08]: What was a really terrible game?

1211
01:26:47,398 --> 01:26:48,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, E.T.

1212
01:26:48,338 --> 01:26:48,898
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?

1213
01:26:49,298 --> 01:26:50,519
[SPEAKER_08]: You just got stuck with it.

1214
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:52,620
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no class action lawsuit because E.T.

1215
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:52,940
[SPEAKER_08]: sucked.

1216
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:59,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura, go into the gaming vault and find a game that, hey, the kids should be playing this week.

1217
01:26:59,102 --> 01:27:00,503
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the classic game of the week?

1218
01:27:00,663 --> 01:27:06,167
[SPEAKER_03]: The Classic Game of the Week is Magical Chase for the PC Engine, also known as the TurboGrafx.

1219
01:27:07,087 --> 01:27:12,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will tell you right now that this is one of the holy grails of the U.S.

1220
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:19,396
[SPEAKER_03]: TurboDuo, sorry, TurboGrafx games, because they did like five copies in the U.S.,

1221
01:27:21,637 --> 01:27:25,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I don't even, I would like a copy of this because it's actually a really neat little game.

1222
01:27:26,779 --> 01:27:32,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Magical Chase was put out by Palsoft and released by Quest on the PC Engine.

1223
01:27:33,221 --> 01:27:35,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Came out in 1991 in Japan and 93 in the US.

1224
01:27:36,142 --> 01:27:39,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And you play as a little witch named Ripple who flies on a broomstick.

1225
01:27:40,763 --> 01:27:43,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear I used to get this confused with Cotton back in the day for the record.

1226
01:27:44,824 --> 01:27:45,705
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have...

1227
01:27:46,545 --> 01:27:47,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Maidens Ingradius

1228
01:28:04,049 --> 01:28:07,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's funny, the article even compares it to Cotton.

1229
01:28:07,633 --> 01:28:09,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Success did Cotton, not Compiles.

1230
01:28:12,057 --> 01:28:22,447
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was one of the last games that was released in the US for the TurboGrafx, TurboDuo, and had a ton of hype, and now it's like you'd be hard-pressed to find a copy.

1231
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:29,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, as you play through the game, you, uh, have, uh, normal and hard difficulty settings.

1232
01:28:30,699 --> 01:28:34,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can only play, uh, the first three levels on easy.

1233
01:28:34,985 --> 01:28:35,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh...

1234
01:28:38,371 --> 01:28:42,954
[SPEAKER_03]: If once your enemies are destroyed, they leave gemstones behind, so that's your currency in games.

1235
01:28:42,974 --> 01:28:48,478
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy power-ups, health, extra lives, except on the third and sixth levels, it only appears once.

1236
01:28:49,758 --> 01:28:53,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Touching stuff on the ground does not kill you, but it does slow you down.

1237
01:28:54,481 --> 01:28:57,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you get trapped behind objects, you get scrolling damage.

1238
01:28:59,174 --> 01:29:01,475
[SPEAKER_03]: You have your different levels.

1239
01:29:01,535 --> 01:29:13,260
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Cuboligon, Dodongren, Kamikaze Dangun, Fat Metal, which just sounds funny, Gemini Snow, and then the Sixth Seal.

1240
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,021
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are other ports.

1241
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:16,942
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a...

1242
01:29:18,783 --> 01:29:22,565
[SPEAKER_03]: version for Windows 95, 98 that came out in 1998.

1243
01:29:23,205 --> 01:29:29,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they did Magical Chase GB for the Game Boy Color only in Japan on August 4th, 2000.

1244
01:29:29,689 --> 01:29:32,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, it's rare.

1245
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:38,694
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I was about to eBay it just to see exactly if there's any copies on eBay right now.

1246
01:29:39,754 --> 01:29:40,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's find out.

1247
01:29:41,995 --> 01:29:43,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's honestly a cute little game.

1248
01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:46,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that level because it looks like she's flying over Tetris blocks.

1249
01:29:46,966 --> 01:29:48,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you trying to autocorrect me to chase?

1250
01:30:12,714 --> 01:30:14,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you keep reading and I'll look it up real quick.

1251
01:30:14,977 --> 01:30:16,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I got it right now.

1252
01:30:16,981 --> 01:30:17,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want the dinner.

1253
01:30:20,645 --> 01:30:32,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Magical Chase, PC Engine, the Japanese version, $229.80 Super Rare, NEC, PC Engine, HuCard This is still the Japanese version, $249.00 $199.00 Even the Game Boy Color version is going for $249.00 We have a Japanese soundtrack for $50.00

1254
01:30:46,044 --> 01:30:46,625
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1255
01:31:08,723 --> 01:31:15,451
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a celebrity, a small internet celebrity, who would make puppy eyes at you until you give it to her.

1256
01:31:16,552 --> 01:31:17,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Panorama Cotton.

1257
01:31:17,713 --> 01:31:18,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are like on my list.

1258
01:31:19,956 --> 01:31:29,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, to be honest, if I saw this and then I saw Radiant Silvergun right next to it to get for Dan, I think that I would do the right thing and get this for myself.

1259
01:31:30,666 --> 01:31:31,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Good answer.

1260
01:31:31,887 --> 01:31:32,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good answer.

1261
01:31:32,408 --> 01:31:33,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I don't think Dan would follow me.

1262
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:34,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1263
01:31:35,371 --> 01:31:38,534
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Magical Chase, No Relation to Cotton.

1264
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,631
[SPEAKER_08]: But a small resemblance to Fantasy Zone.

1265
01:31:41,771 --> 01:31:43,252
[SPEAKER_03]: But she doesn't go, Willow!

1266
01:31:43,572 --> 01:31:44,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1267
01:31:44,893 --> 01:31:45,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Good pick.

1268
01:31:45,734 --> 01:31:48,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew nothing about this game, and now I'm looking at it going, gosh, I want to play this.

1269
01:31:48,856 --> 01:31:50,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Too bad I'll have to emulate it.

1270
01:31:50,597 --> 01:31:54,519
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get... It is out there, too.

1271
01:31:54,879 --> 01:31:55,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it is.

1272
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it is.

1273
01:31:57,601 --> 01:32:00,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would not blame a single soul for downloading the game.

1274
01:32:00,543 --> 01:32:00,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

1275
01:32:02,004 --> 01:32:15,778
[SPEAKER_08]: in my allegedly you know a game that's this hard to find that's this old I mean who could really fault you for it if it was on virtual console or something we'd say go you better believe I have an emulated copy of Panorama Cotton since they made 600 total in the world so

1276
01:32:16,673 --> 01:32:19,015
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, there it is, your classic Game of the Week segment.

1277
01:32:19,336 --> 01:32:20,076
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a break.

1278
01:32:20,437 --> 01:32:22,819
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back, plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come.

1279
01:32:23,339 --> 01:32:25,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox rumors, yippee-yay.

1280
01:32:25,261 --> 01:32:27,303
[SPEAKER_08]: We only have a few more weeks to sit through those.

1281
01:32:28,244 --> 01:32:33,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Also talking about some free-to-play stuff on Wii U. Call of Duty, yes, and plenty more.

1282
01:32:33,669 --> 01:32:36,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Your calls in the Fugle Question of the Week, all about pinball tonight.

1283
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:36,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Duty.

1284
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:41,276
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1285
01:32:47,982 --> 01:32:58,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Cinco de Mayo, May 5th, 2013, with episode 503 of our show already in progress.

1286
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:07,697
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, you missed some pretty lively debates in the first half of the show, so we hope you will check that out in the podcast feed.

1287
01:33:08,358 --> 01:33:12,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have to give apologies here at the start of this segment to our friends over at Anime Jam Session.

1288
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:16,562
[SPEAKER_08]: They put on a lovely show, which is on Tuesday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network.

1289
01:33:16,702 --> 01:33:18,563
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.

1290
01:33:18,643 --> 01:33:20,103
[SPEAKER_08]: And they rebroadcast Thursday mornings.

1291
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:28,685
[SPEAKER_08]: They sent us a bumper for the 500th episode that I still haven't played because I was trying to sync it to music a couple weeks ago.

1292
01:33:28,705 --> 01:33:30,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And I literally ran out of time because it wasn't working.

1293
01:33:31,066 --> 01:33:32,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just forgot to do it today.

1294
01:33:32,946 --> 01:33:38,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've also been procrastinating it because nobody else except Flaco sent us a bumper.

1295
01:33:38,508 --> 01:33:38,688
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1296
01:33:39,088 --> 01:33:44,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Please take a look at the post in our forums and send us more bumpers and then I'll have reasons to play them all.

1297
01:33:44,592 --> 01:33:53,978
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also want to give a shout out to our pals over there at Anime Jam Session because I got a lovely package in the mail from a mail package from Ranma this week.

1298
01:33:54,898 --> 01:33:55,919
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1299
01:34:21,138 --> 01:34:40,369
[SPEAKER_08]: in coming weeks of the show and maybe if there's like a live event coming up like Fanime or something I'll take some of these with me to that and you can win them from me there too so yeah thank you very much to our pals over there I think Brad's first in line now well what did Brad say oh I sent you guys booze what else do you want

1300
01:34:41,249 --> 01:34:43,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Brad, you make a good case.

1301
01:34:43,932 --> 01:34:46,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I should be sending him some Cards Against Humanity cards for sure.

1302
01:34:48,316 --> 01:34:50,818
[SPEAKER_08]: We trade goods amongst the Voice of Geeks Network shows.

1303
01:34:50,838 --> 01:34:51,719
[SPEAKER_06]: The bartering system.

1304
01:34:51,739 --> 01:34:52,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, bartering system.

1305
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,722
[SPEAKER_08]: You give me booze, I give you cards.

1306
01:34:55,603 --> 01:35:00,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't give Anime Jam Session anything yet, but I will... Ranma has my heart.

1307
01:35:01,369 --> 01:35:02,129
[SPEAKER_08]: They have my heart.

1308
01:35:02,209 --> 01:35:02,790
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they have.

1309
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:03,631
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1310
01:35:06,133 --> 01:35:13,256
[SPEAKER_03]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase FLAG.

1311
01:35:13,937 --> 01:35:16,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let us get back into some gaming news.

1312
01:35:17,138 --> 01:35:19,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Rapid fire news for this part B. Loki.

1313
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:24,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Borderlands has, well, originally it kind of leaked out from a picture, but...

1314
01:35:25,602 --> 01:35:37,371
[SPEAKER_06]: it has now been officially announced Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is going to be the next piece of DLC or I should say the last piece or fourth piece did they make her politically correct yet?

1315
01:35:37,652 --> 01:35:50,882
[SPEAKER_06]: no so it's sort of a play on Dungeons and Dragons it'll be interesting so that's supposed to be coming out June 25th and it will be included in the season pass otherwise it's 10 bucks

1316
01:35:54,182 --> 01:35:57,565
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new game console trailer this week.

1317
01:35:57,885 --> 01:36:03,229
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even really a game console as much as it's more of like an analog video game synthesizer.

1318
01:36:03,609 --> 01:36:05,310
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a thing called Ming Mecca.

1319
01:36:06,231 --> 01:36:08,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really strange.

1320
01:36:08,232 --> 01:36:10,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it works just like a synthesizer.

1321
01:36:10,394 --> 01:36:17,559
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has a lot of analog, you know, physical cords that you're plugging in the stuff and, you know, dials you're tweaking and that sort of thing.

1322
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:18,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of...

1323
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:23,943
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes music like a synthesizer and also kind of does an interactive display.

1324
01:36:24,403 --> 01:36:27,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you could do games and stuff sort of on it.

1325
01:36:27,345 --> 01:36:29,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Very basic glitchy looking things.

1326
01:36:31,068 --> 01:36:35,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I see this more as like something that you would see with like chiptune artists or something like that.

1327
01:36:35,231 --> 01:36:38,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of messing around with you know in like a live performance type setting.

1328
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:42,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it seems like that would you know play well to it.

1329
01:36:42,796 --> 01:36:44,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus it is open source.

1330
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:49,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can actually you know build one yourself if you want.

1331
01:36:50,000 --> 01:37:15,777
[SPEAKER_06]: or they're going to be selling it they said they estimate the console is going to be anywhere from you know um you know was it $350 for the control core or $1,000 for the world core because it's a few I mean we're talking like it is a synthesizer so that's kind of in the realm of that makes sense price wise as a video game console not so much but it does get controlled partially within the NES controller so it looks interesting um

1332
01:37:16,837 --> 01:37:41,777
[SPEAKER_06]: and last but not least the kickstarted project or it was attempted to be kickstarted but it kind of failed Project Awakened has now put itself on hold I guess due to alternate funding options and donors are now receiving refunds in other words somebody is picking this thing up and will probably publish it so that's kind of cool

1333
01:37:43,058 --> 01:37:44,239
[SPEAKER_06]: because it looked kind of interesting.

1334
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:46,201
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the first Unreal 4 games.

1335
01:37:46,622 --> 01:37:52,607
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a third-person superhero action game.

1336
01:37:53,468 --> 01:37:54,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could be neat.

1337
01:37:54,966 --> 01:37:57,067
[SPEAKER_08]: DRAGON QUEST 8 White Knight Chronicles Rare Drop Adventure Note

1338
01:38:14,895 --> 01:38:17,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Earth Devastating B-Rank Girlfriend.

1339
01:38:18,356 --> 01:38:19,957
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it's called.

1340
01:38:20,317 --> 01:38:21,278
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an awesome title.

1341
01:38:21,738 --> 01:38:22,898
[SPEAKER_08]: And Wonderflick.

1342
01:38:23,418 --> 01:38:24,959
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of a neat little sounding thing, too.

1343
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:28,080
[SPEAKER_08]: They were all trademarked by the developer all around the same time.

1344
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows what this could be?

1345
01:38:29,241 --> 01:38:31,262
[SPEAKER_08]: These could be three titles in one series.

1346
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:33,062
[SPEAKER_08]: These could all be new games in development.

1347
01:38:33,803 --> 01:38:34,903
[SPEAKER_08]: They could be red herrings.

1348
01:38:35,223 --> 01:38:35,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1349
01:38:35,563 --> 01:38:36,264
[SPEAKER_08]: They could be anything.

1350
01:38:37,024 --> 01:38:40,565
[SPEAKER_08]: But I hope they all sound like neat titles.

1351
01:38:40,625 --> 01:38:42,166
[SPEAKER_08]: So whatever they are, they're pretty kick-ass titles.

1352
01:38:42,967 --> 01:39:04,805
[SPEAKER_06]: but of course you know you can't judge a game based off its title but these are good starts but we don't know anything else about these maybe E3 maybe Tokyo Game Show it sounds like it might be like the third guild game they always have like these weird like kind of indie games that are a prize of that so maybe these are titles in that okay that's a good theory

1353
01:39:05,686 --> 01:39:05,946
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1354
01:39:06,366 --> 01:39:12,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Nintendo apparently going to be introducing Retro Studios' new project in the not-so-distant future.

1355
01:39:13,193 --> 01:39:15,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Could this be E3 or a Nintendo Direct?

1356
01:39:16,175 --> 01:39:16,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1357
01:39:17,477 --> 01:39:21,300
[SPEAKER_08]: But Hiroyamada said, quote, I wonder what kind of game it is.

1358
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:24,763
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope to introduce it to you in the not-so-distant future.

1359
01:39:24,984 --> 01:39:25,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1360
01:39:26,585 --> 01:39:28,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you what it should be It should be a new Excite Shark game

1361
01:39:41,923 --> 01:39:42,964
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be a new Excite Truck game.

1362
01:39:42,984 --> 01:39:45,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you want Retro Studios to be working on?

1363
01:39:45,206 --> 01:39:46,327
[SPEAKER_06]: That would sell me a system.

1364
01:39:46,527 --> 01:39:48,228
[SPEAKER_06]: A new Excite Truck game that's good.

1365
01:39:48,508 --> 01:39:53,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking fucking Excite Bots trick racing because that was absolute shit.

1366
01:39:54,133 --> 01:39:57,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be tickled pink if it's a new Metroid or a new F-Zero.

1367
01:39:58,296 --> 01:39:59,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially a new F-Zero.

1368
01:39:59,937 --> 01:40:00,678
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be pretty cool.

1369
01:40:01,478 --> 01:40:02,699
[SPEAKER_08]: At least that's a racing game, Loki.

1370
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,060
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta get excited about that a little bit.

1371
01:40:04,981 --> 01:40:07,343
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1372
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:29,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it online only?

1373
01:40:29,771 --> 01:40:31,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the rumor is, yes it is.

1374
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:36,234
[SPEAKER_08]: But what, I mean, of course that rumor is going to be out there after what happened with SimCity.

1375
01:40:36,274 --> 01:40:39,856
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be very interesting to see how what happened with SimCity plays into this.

1376
01:40:40,236 --> 01:40:45,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Regardless, we all know it's got to happen eventually, but it looks like it's something that could be happening relatively soon.

1377
01:40:45,819 --> 01:40:48,740
[SPEAKER_08]: They are saying this could actually be announced tomorrow, May 6th.

1378
01:40:48,941 --> 01:40:52,002
[SPEAKER_08]: So by the time any of you hear this podcast, it could have been announced today.

1379
01:40:52,443 --> 01:40:59,472
[SPEAKER_08]: This is due to a web domain registration apparently by EA which I would have thought you would grab the Sims 4 name a hell of a long time ago.

1380
01:40:59,612 --> 01:40:59,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1381
01:41:00,533 --> 01:41:02,957
[SPEAKER_08]: The studio is holding a conference call tomorrow.

1382
01:41:03,237 --> 01:41:04,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Supposed to be making a major announcement.

1383
01:41:04,839 --> 01:41:06,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So what the hell else would it be?

1384
01:41:06,181 --> 01:41:08,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Except maybe five more Sims 3 expansions.

1385
01:41:08,704 --> 01:41:08,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1386
01:41:10,046 --> 01:41:11,086
[SPEAKER_06]: They have about that many.

1387
01:41:11,786 --> 01:41:13,087
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to know what's really sad?

1388
01:41:13,807 --> 01:41:22,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that with Sims 3, the stuff that the mod community's been doing is worlds better than any of the official stuff that EA put out.

1389
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:26,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even down to custom furniture, everything.

1390
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:28,811
[SPEAKER_03]: The fan community has just been perfect.

1391
01:41:28,851 --> 01:41:34,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love for... It would actually... I would buy it if they would hire some of the mod people.

1392
01:41:34,773 --> 01:41:35,413
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who've done mods.

1393
01:41:35,433 --> 01:41:36,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're not Valve.

1394
01:41:36,673 --> 01:41:43,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but I'm saying that would sell it for me right there is certain people in the custom community.

1395
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:44,565
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to be always connected?

1396
01:41:45,066 --> 01:41:46,047
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

1397
01:41:46,448 --> 01:41:47,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate people.

1398
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:49,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Sims Online...

1399
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Sims Online worked so well.

1400
01:41:54,418 --> 01:41:58,241
[SPEAKER_08]: And also the Sims Social worked so well that they're totally closing that game.

1401
01:41:58,261 --> 01:42:00,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Sims Social, everybody was fucking playing that.

1402
01:42:01,243 --> 01:42:02,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Sims Social.

1403
01:42:02,304 --> 01:42:03,885
[SPEAKER_08]: That came and went.

1404
01:42:04,025 --> 01:42:07,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of wish Candy Crush Saga would... I finally blocked it this week, y'all.

1405
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:08,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't anymore.

1406
01:42:08,669 --> 01:42:15,875
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what happens last night, I'm lying in bed and I hear this very familiar song and I'm like, what are you doing over there on your phone, Alan?

1407
01:42:16,417 --> 01:42:19,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm stuck on level 29 in Candy Crush Saga.

1408
01:42:19,758 --> 01:42:20,959
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

1409
01:42:21,419 --> 01:42:22,339
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't escape.

1410
01:42:22,999 --> 01:42:25,680
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, I don't hate people, just most people.

1411
01:42:27,841 --> 01:42:29,222
[SPEAKER_08]: You love all our listeners, right?

1412
01:42:29,782 --> 01:42:30,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1413
01:42:30,062 --> 01:42:31,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good.

1414
01:42:32,343 --> 01:42:33,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love you guys.

1415
01:42:35,684 --> 01:42:36,585
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously, I love you guys.

1416
01:42:36,605 --> 01:42:36,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1417
01:42:37,185 --> 01:42:37,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

1418
01:42:37,885 --> 01:42:38,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you mean it.

1419
01:42:38,445 --> 01:42:38,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1420
01:42:39,426 --> 01:42:40,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1421
01:42:41,546 --> 01:42:42,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not Grumpy Cat.

1422
01:42:43,967 --> 01:42:45,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not Grumpy Cat.

1423
01:42:45,388 --> 01:42:45,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm...

1424
01:42:47,310 --> 01:43:15,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Disgruntled Cat Anyway, Square Enix is remastering soundtracks from Final Fantasy games We will be seeing the Final Fantasy 4 one released on looks like July 3rd this year That's the first one they're starting with and they're going to have box art done especially by Yoshitaka Amano and then of course we're probably not going to see it in the US but

1425
01:43:16,195 --> 01:43:19,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Square Enix does do digital releases for a lot of their albums so we might see it on iTunes

1426
01:43:21,611 --> 01:43:26,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, if you actually want a physical CD so that you can get the awesome artwork, there's always CD Japan.

1427
01:43:27,533 --> 01:43:32,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Breakman, I am not hating your faces, okay?

1428
01:43:33,034 --> 01:43:34,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hate anyone's faces.

1429
01:43:35,735 --> 01:43:49,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we have a notice that there is a DVD out called 100 Yen, the Japanese Arcade Experience, which is a documentary about arcade culture in Japan.

1430
01:43:50,419 --> 01:43:53,001
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a trailer for it out if you're interested in looking at it.

1431
01:43:53,161 --> 01:44:00,869
[SPEAKER_03]: But not only does it talk about just gaming, arcade gaming in Japan, it does talk about the US and Canada as well.

1432
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:02,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And the casual gamers.

1433
01:44:06,065 --> 01:44:21,662
[SPEAKER_03]: and last but not least for people who are pinball fans like me Pinball FX 2 is coming to Steam the game itself will be free but the tables will be 10 bucks a pop 6 pounds for our British listeners

1434
01:44:22,382 --> 01:44:34,433
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's including Star Wars Pinball, Marvel Pinball, Marvel Pinball Adventures of Virtue, Marvel Pinball Avengers Chronicles, Pinball FX2 Core Collection and Zen Classics.

1435
01:44:35,654 --> 01:44:37,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a pretty good time playing it.

1436
01:44:37,436 --> 01:44:44,382
[SPEAKER_03]: It sort of gave me some of the feel of Pin Mame but not quite.

1437
01:44:45,923 --> 01:44:47,865
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all original stuff so it was pretty neat.

1438
01:44:48,325 --> 01:44:48,746
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1439
01:44:48,926 --> 01:44:49,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1440
01:44:49,986 --> 01:44:59,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so let's move on a little bit to some actual, I don't know, Xbox rumors, if you will.

1441
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:18,391
[SPEAKER_06]: This week, it was made known that Microsoft has registered the domain for Xbox Fusion, and also some other stuff related to XboxFusion.de, XboxFusion.co.uk, XboxFusion.biz...

1442
01:45:19,711 --> 01:45:26,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So, one would think, hey, you know, Xbox Fusion, that could be a name of a console, maybe.

1443
01:45:29,018 --> 01:45:35,382
[SPEAKER_06]: So, good chances are that that might be actually what they're going to finally call the console.

1444
01:45:36,964 --> 01:45:39,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little bit better than Xbox Lube, I don't know.

1445
01:45:40,726 --> 01:45:43,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless they're having a service called Fusion.

1446
01:45:43,869 --> 01:46:04,712
[SPEAKER_06]: uh that's true I guess they could have that as well um but there at least there is something that's going to be you know kind of um relating to the Xbox it's going to be named Fusion so we'll see if it's actually the console or it's not a bad name for a console I guess it could work it just seems like they arbitrarily picked a name out of their asses Fusion sounds cool let's call it that

1447
01:46:05,997 --> 01:46:30,628
[SPEAKER_06]: and also there is a rumor that the next or the first I guess debut game of Respawn Entertainment is going to actually be this game called Titan and some information is kind of leaked out about it already saying that the game is going to revolve around these giant mechs called Titans and

1448
01:46:31,148 --> 01:46:55,855
[SPEAKER_06]: and so it's kind of a multiplayer shooter game but then it's also got these giant mechs as well kind of think it's like a little bit like mech warrior but maybe more of the scale of it kind of reminds me of like a command and conquer generals and like mech warrior the titan thing is really funny because blizzard has that project titan thing right now now that we all know that's not the real name of the game but it's just funny that like there is a game called titan maybe

1449
01:46:57,486 --> 01:46:59,547
[SPEAKER_06]: and then, um, what else?

1450
01:47:00,207 --> 01:47:04,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and apparently the, you know, this might be exclusive to the next platform.

1451
01:47:04,749 --> 01:47:07,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming it's going to be exclusive for a limited amount of time.

1452
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:10,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's going to be exclusive forever, but probably at launch.

1453
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:13,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And Microsoft's had a few deals like this with the DLC, Windows and all that.

1454
01:47:13,892 --> 01:47:14,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Skyrim, right?

1455
01:47:14,752 --> 01:47:15,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Had that?

1456
01:47:15,993 --> 01:47:16,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1457
01:47:16,833 --> 01:47:17,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.

1458
01:47:17,653 --> 01:47:18,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Skyrim did.

1459
01:47:18,654 --> 01:47:21,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty does and, um, did.

1460
01:47:22,175 --> 01:47:23,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto did.

1461
01:47:23,655 --> 01:47:24,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1462
01:47:24,916 --> 01:47:25,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

1463
01:47:27,336 --> 01:47:28,817
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a lot.

1464
01:47:29,998 --> 01:47:34,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, Illumaroom had a new trailer this week.

1465
01:47:34,642 --> 01:47:48,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those who don't remember, Illumaroom is this brand new peripheral that's going to tie in with the new Xbox and perhaps PCs as well to kind of extend the play field for your games.

1466
01:47:49,275 --> 01:47:53,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way it's being done, they actually showed the device this time, so we don't have to imagine what it looks like.

1467
01:47:54,119 --> 01:47:56,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all very prototype right now.

1468
01:47:56,801 --> 01:48:01,723
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, it's basically a projector attached to a Kinect sensor.

1469
01:48:02,384 --> 01:48:03,945
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Kinect sensor scans the room.

1470
01:48:04,045 --> 01:48:08,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it actually will... You can use it for special effects.

1471
01:48:09,027 --> 01:48:13,090
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use it to increase your field of view.

1472
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:15,031
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also use it for like...

1473
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:17,840
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1474
01:48:35,806 --> 01:48:38,907
[SPEAKER_06]: as early as July is when they're going to publicly demo this.

1475
01:48:39,367 --> 01:48:42,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not expected to be something that the system launches with if it does eventually come out.

1476
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:45,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Which might have bummed out some people that were kind of looking forward to something like this.

1477
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:47,250
[SPEAKER_08]: The concepts look really cool.

1478
01:48:47,930 --> 01:49:01,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be worried that if they launched this with a console, which, don't get me wrong, I think if they could get it in the console and have the price of it be cheap enough, because adding a projector, an HD projector, and another Kinect sensor.

1479
01:49:01,275 --> 01:49:03,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but what if it's not like the images itself?

1480
01:49:04,077 --> 01:49:09,681
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's just like colored lights and things like that that enhance the... But it's actually... I mean, it looks neat.

1481
01:49:09,941 --> 01:49:10,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it looked neat.

1482
01:49:11,002 --> 01:49:17,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's what they're still trying to figure out is the... The problem is though is they envision it as like a projector that sits on a coffee table.

1483
01:49:17,506 --> 01:49:21,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So once again, you're talking Kinect sensor... I don't got a coffee table.

1484
01:49:21,529 --> 01:49:21,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

1485
01:49:22,009 --> 01:49:23,130
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for rich people.

1486
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:24,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a coffee table.

1487
01:49:24,571 --> 01:49:30,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have this... You're limiting it now to, okay, it's going to have this... This thing is going to sit on a coffee table.

1488
01:49:31,255 --> 01:49:32,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hold on a second.

1489
01:49:33,236 --> 01:49:36,358
[SPEAKER_06]: If I have to have a coffee table in my room, this projection is going to say... Where do I play Kinect?

1490
01:49:36,498 --> 01:49:37,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1491
01:49:37,419 --> 01:49:38,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1492
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:41,101
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're telling me to move the coffee table out of the way to play the Kinect games.

1493
01:49:41,321 --> 01:49:42,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm confused.

1494
01:49:42,142 --> 01:49:44,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not rearranging the goddamn furniture to play Xbox.

1495
01:49:44,363 --> 01:49:46,325
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want me to do with this coffee table?

1496
01:49:47,445 --> 01:49:50,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft unveils the easily movable coffee table.

1497
01:49:50,467 --> 01:49:51,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It moves out.

1498
01:49:51,088 --> 01:49:51,868
[SPEAKER_06]: It moves back in.

1499
01:49:51,948 --> 01:49:53,669
[SPEAKER_06]: It puts sensors on it.

1500
01:49:53,709 --> 01:49:54,730
[SPEAKER_06]: It puts coffee on it.

1501
01:49:55,170 --> 01:49:55,450
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

1502
01:49:55,490 --> 01:49:57,372
[SPEAKER_08]: The Microsoft Transformer coffee table.

1503
01:49:58,032 --> 01:49:58,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming to you from Ikea.

1504
01:49:58,873 --> 01:49:59,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1505
01:50:01,505 --> 01:50:02,946
[SPEAKER_08]: That would mean you'd have to build it yourself.

1506
01:50:03,307 --> 01:50:06,269
[SPEAKER_08]: And it would have a name like Sfarcigar Devan.

1507
01:50:07,670 --> 01:50:08,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Billy.

1508
01:50:08,871 --> 01:50:09,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the bookcase.

1509
01:50:09,952 --> 01:50:10,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1510
01:50:11,634 --> 01:50:14,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Fusion is the new coffee table.

1511
01:50:14,656 --> 01:50:17,098
[SPEAKER_06]: This system is the coffee table.

1512
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:19,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It fuses to your coffee table.

1513
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:20,661
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the coffee table.

1514
01:50:21,041 --> 01:50:22,523
[SPEAKER_08]: It becomes one with the coffee table.

1515
01:50:22,543 --> 01:50:24,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It hopefully has nothing to do with Fusion Frenzy.

1516
01:50:25,886 --> 01:50:28,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's pray, please, that it has nothing to do with Fusion Frenzy.

1517
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:32,184
[SPEAKER_06]: or what if we can see the headlines now.

1518
01:50:32,425 --> 01:50:34,587
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a frenzy for the new Xbox Fusion.

1519
01:50:34,647 --> 01:50:37,731
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Fusion frenzy.

1520
01:50:38,091 --> 01:50:45,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakman in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, Xbox needs to move the coffee table its damn self.

1521
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:47,081
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hilarious.

1522
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:48,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Setting up room for connect.

1523
01:50:51,765 --> 01:50:53,366
[SPEAKER_08]: It just knocks over your coffee table.

1524
01:50:54,286 --> 01:50:57,548
[SPEAKER_08]: It disappears into the floor with everything that was left on it.

1525
01:50:57,948 --> 01:50:59,569
[SPEAKER_06]: It pushes the cat out of the way.

1526
01:51:02,570 --> 01:51:08,172
[SPEAKER_06]: With Xbox Fusion's new telekinetic abilities, it can move your furniture for you.

1527
01:51:08,832 --> 01:51:10,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Arrange a drone for a connect.

1528
01:51:12,353 --> 01:51:13,074
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be hilarious.

1529
01:51:13,094 --> 01:51:17,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I want one of those giant holes that opens up in the ground to drop people I don't like out of sight forever.

1530
01:51:17,576 --> 01:51:18,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Creating a knee-high wall.

1531
01:51:18,837 --> 01:51:19,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Couch moves in the place.

1532
01:51:21,218 --> 01:51:22,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, now we're getting stupid.

1533
01:51:22,979 --> 01:51:24,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to the Fugo Question of the Week.

1534
01:51:32,301 --> 01:51:35,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook, Google+, slam them together, you get Fugle.

1535
01:51:36,002 --> 01:51:37,462
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Fugle question of the week.

1536
01:51:37,642 --> 01:51:41,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week we ask a question of our fan communities and read some of our favorite answers here on the show.

1537
01:51:42,383 --> 01:51:45,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, like last week, way too many answers.

1538
01:51:45,564 --> 01:51:46,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only read some of them tonight.

1539
01:51:46,725 --> 01:51:47,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, guys.

1540
01:51:47,725 --> 01:51:51,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start on Google+, with the answer to the question about pinball.

1541
01:51:52,466 --> 01:51:55,907
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura likes to talk about pinball a lot on the show.

1542
01:51:56,427 --> 01:51:57,227
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot, you guys.

1543
01:51:57,467 --> 01:51:58,487
[SPEAKER_08]: She talks about it a lot.

1544
01:51:58,908 --> 01:52:00,188
[SPEAKER_08]: She's talked about it five minutes ago.

1545
01:52:01,084 --> 01:52:01,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Ice P on Google Plus

1546
01:52:23,064 --> 01:52:28,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my favorite simulators were Pinball Dreams, Pinball Fantasies, and Slam Tilt on the Amiga.

1547
01:52:30,285 --> 01:52:32,726
[SPEAKER_08]: The very first thing a listener named was my absolute favorite.

1548
01:52:32,766 --> 01:52:34,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Pinball Dreams was on the PC as well.

1549
01:52:34,726 --> 01:52:36,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it was more known as an Amiga game.

1550
01:52:36,506 --> 01:52:37,326
[SPEAKER_08]: The game was amazing.

1551
01:52:37,406 --> 01:52:38,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And Pinball Fantasies was great too.

1552
01:52:39,987 --> 01:52:41,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I just had one of those random thoughts.

1553
01:52:41,547 --> 01:52:41,727
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1554
01:52:42,167 --> 01:52:44,208
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Commodore 64 set that works for arcade.

1555
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:45,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Just letting you know.

1556
01:52:46,388 --> 01:52:47,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the emulator thingy?

1557
01:52:47,768 --> 01:52:48,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I have that.

1558
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:50,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Stoked.

1559
01:52:50,629 --> 01:52:52,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, back to Pinball.

1560
01:52:53,088 --> 01:52:55,830
[SPEAKER_08]: How can you of all people change the topic away from pinball?

1561
01:52:56,130 --> 01:52:56,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Shame on you.

1562
01:52:57,071 --> 01:52:59,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're talking about Dragon Crush?

1563
01:52:59,812 --> 01:53:00,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Going back to Ice P.

1564
01:53:02,378 --> 01:53:27,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the fact that these weren't real tables the way no one could unfavorably compare them to the real thing plus it allowed them the freedom to let their imagination run wild Panaxium says I remember my first pinball game was Moraph's Pinball back on the 386 I was too young to understand how awful of a game that was later I got hooked on Epic Pinball and that was a blast however I don't think I ever had the chance to play a real pinball table really?

1565
01:53:28,598 --> 01:53:29,980
[SPEAKER_08]: You've never played a real pinball table?

1566
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess maybe that's one of those things I take for granted.

1567
01:53:32,423 --> 01:53:32,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Bars.

1568
01:53:33,103 --> 01:53:37,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, maybe you're not like a bar person, but a lot of bars have them, have pinball tables.

1569
01:53:38,009 --> 01:53:38,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowling alleys.

1570
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:40,492
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's a thing where you're at.

1571
01:53:40,612 --> 01:53:41,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Movie theaters.

1572
01:53:41,293 --> 01:53:42,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Movie theaters.

1573
01:53:42,154 --> 01:53:44,677
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to... And John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza.

1574
01:53:44,697 --> 01:53:46,540
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to go find a pinball table, son.

1575
01:53:47,761 --> 01:53:50,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Travis H on Google Plus says, I love pinball.

1576
01:53:50,444 --> 01:53:54,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Used to play the Addams Family table until my quarters ran dry at a rec center here in Florida.

1577
01:53:55,129 --> 01:53:56,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Also love the Indiana Jones table.

1578
01:53:56,890 --> 01:53:58,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I play a lot of Zen pinball on my Vita.

1579
01:53:59,173 --> 01:54:03,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Collecting the tables and going back and forth with friends trying to top scores.

1580
01:54:03,137 --> 01:54:03,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Great game.

1581
01:54:04,589 --> 01:54:05,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Prop Cycle Addams Family?

1582
01:54:06,271 --> 01:54:07,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

1583
01:54:07,812 --> 01:54:09,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that at California Extreme or something?

1584
01:54:09,573 --> 01:54:09,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1585
01:54:09,833 --> 01:54:11,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, we need to figure out when that is this year.

1586
01:54:11,094 --> 01:54:13,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Pinnagogo's coming up in a couple months too, by the way.

1587
01:54:13,076 --> 01:54:13,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it really?

1588
01:54:13,536 --> 01:54:13,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1589
01:54:14,076 --> 01:54:15,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to get these things on the calendar.

1590
01:54:16,238 --> 01:54:18,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... Isn't... We're taking our jackpot.

1591
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:21,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't California Extreme almost always the last weekend in July?

1592
01:54:21,402 --> 01:54:23,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I bet you it's the same frickin' day as Clue.

1593
01:54:23,564 --> 01:54:24,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you anything.

1594
01:54:24,979 --> 01:54:37,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that might be, but I know that for, well, Pentagogo is the one in Dixon and we're taking Jackbot there because the creator of Jackbot and a bunch of the series is going to be at Pentagogo this year.

1595
01:54:38,106 --> 01:54:40,428
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's July 13th to 14th this year.

1596
01:54:40,648 --> 01:54:44,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be in rehearsals that weekend, but maybe I can go on Sunday at least.

1597
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:45,871
[SPEAKER_08]: We should still make it happen.

1598
01:54:46,031 --> 01:54:46,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I should.

1599
01:54:46,671 --> 01:54:47,412
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun.

1600
01:54:47,772 --> 01:54:48,233
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow.

1601
01:54:49,414 --> 01:54:50,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Where were we?

1602
01:54:50,454 --> 01:54:51,055
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to Facebook.

1603
01:54:51,095 --> 01:54:52,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are some of the answers from Google+.

1604
01:54:52,756 --> 01:54:54,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Please check out our community on Google to read them all.

1605
01:54:55,258 --> 01:54:58,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to read some of the answers here on Facebook as well.

1606
01:54:58,861 --> 01:55:02,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy R. says, I still don't quite get pinball.

1607
01:55:03,004 --> 01:55:03,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Any tips for Andy?

1608
01:55:25,448 --> 01:55:27,889
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a series of DVDs out.

1609
01:55:28,309 --> 01:55:31,671
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a few of them, but a lot of them have been put on YouTube.

1610
01:55:32,431 --> 01:55:35,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually teaches you a little bit of the physics involved with a well-balanced pinball table.

1611
01:55:36,813 --> 01:55:46,318
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is learning how to catch the ball with your flippers and learning where your triggers are because pretty much it's really just a game of physics.

1612
01:55:47,017 --> 01:55:52,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ever... Here's the most common mistake new players make, is that they hit both flippers at the same time.

1613
01:55:52,561 --> 01:55:53,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ever do that.

1614
01:55:53,922 --> 01:55:58,905
[SPEAKER_08]: The only time that might work is multiball, when it just so happens to be timed that way.

1615
01:55:59,245 --> 01:56:04,148
[SPEAKER_08]: But you gotta get yourself out of the habit of hitting both flippers at the same time, and if you can do that, that's the first step.

1616
01:56:04,388 --> 01:56:07,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you were just trying to keep from draining, keep your eye on the flippers.

1617
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:12,885
[SPEAKER_03]: When you see that ball come into your field of vision, hit whatever flipper it's going towards.

1618
01:56:12,905 --> 01:56:13,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I want to play some pinball.

1619
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:15,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to my house.

1620
01:56:15,246 --> 01:56:15,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn this question.

1621
01:56:15,786 --> 01:56:16,026
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1622
01:56:16,206 --> 01:56:17,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to my house.

1623
01:56:17,526 --> 01:56:20,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeremy J., my buddy from Koopa Club.

1624
01:56:20,107 --> 01:56:21,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give a shout out to that podcast.

1625
01:56:21,728 --> 01:56:22,848
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a fun little bunch.

1626
01:56:22,968 --> 01:56:25,409
[SPEAKER_08]: They just had a Drunky episode not that long ago either.

1627
01:56:25,469 --> 01:56:26,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are fun.

1628
01:56:26,289 --> 01:56:51,018
[SPEAKER_08]: so looking forward to meeting him in August when they come out here for GamerX but anyway Jeremy J says I'm dreadful at pinball in every form whether it's on an actual table or a digital version that doesn't stop me from really enjoying it though I sunk 10 plus hours into Zen Pinball 2 and didn't even realize it in terms of tables I wouldn't pass up anything horror related would have to get at least one go from me Twilight Zone, Creature from the Black Lagoon etc.

1629
01:56:51,118 --> 01:56:53,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Creature is awesome you used to have that one we did yeah

1630
01:56:54,722 --> 01:56:55,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Gaming Nerd says,

1631
01:57:10,191 --> 01:57:19,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Video game pinball is emulated realism and can still run the risk of a bug in the physics engine used to simulate the ball's movement and hit detection against the bumpers, flippers, etc.

1632
01:57:20,238 --> 01:57:25,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, who doesn't love a machine full of flashing lights and that deafening loud knocker when you earn a free game?

1633
01:57:25,882 --> 01:57:30,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Not going to disagree with you, gaming nerd, but the real machines can be full of bugs too.

1634
01:57:30,965 --> 01:57:31,265
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1635
01:57:58,863 --> 01:58:16,751
[SPEAKER_03]: well we had a mention of Twilight Zone earlier with Twilight Zone they also use ceramic balls for Powerball shut up you guys should see the look on Rob's face it's maybe a little troll face do you shine the balls yourself?

1636
01:58:17,861 --> 01:58:18,341
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1637
01:58:18,862 --> 01:58:19,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Bite me.

1638
01:58:20,002 --> 01:58:26,706
[SPEAKER_03]: But another thing too, tables are actually waxed, especially if they're wood surface tables.

1639
01:58:27,566 --> 01:58:28,787
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot that has to be done.

1640
01:58:28,887 --> 01:58:32,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the type of leg that you use, because we have those nice brass ones on the World Cup.

1641
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:34,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes even the leg you use on it.

1642
01:58:34,871 --> 01:58:36,912
[SPEAKER_03]: But so much goes into the balance of the game.

1643
01:58:36,932 --> 01:58:39,433
[SPEAKER_03]: You have so many different components to make sure work.

1644
01:58:40,514 --> 01:58:46,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Upkeep of a physical table is going to make or break you playing the game.

1645
01:58:46,570 --> 01:58:55,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So would you say that after extended play on a wax table that the balls would eventually become wax as well?

1646
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakman in chat says, my balls need a good shining.

1647
01:58:58,702 --> 01:59:00,104
[SPEAKER_03]: You can shine your own damn balls.

1648
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:06,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe after the show he should just go do that.

1649
01:59:06,613 --> 01:59:07,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to know about it.

1650
01:59:08,295 --> 01:59:09,016
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just pinball.

1651
01:59:09,637 --> 01:59:09,937
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1652
01:59:11,078 --> 01:59:13,481
[SPEAKER_08]: VXJasonXV in chat asks a real question here.

1653
01:59:14,102 --> 01:59:16,344
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the reason for the free game knocker?

1654
01:59:16,525 --> 01:59:17,245
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question.

1655
01:59:17,286 --> 01:59:19,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that fucking thing so loud when you win a free game?

1656
01:59:19,588 --> 01:59:21,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that just to draw attention in the arcade?

1657
01:59:22,291 --> 01:59:22,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, tradition?

1658
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:23,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1659
01:59:23,693 --> 01:59:32,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe, actually, my thought of it being so loud is that, this is my own theory, is that it's so loud in an arcade that they want to draw attention to that you won one.

1660
01:59:33,059 --> 01:59:34,220
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I figured, yeah.

1661
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:41,625
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we were, I was playing Jackbot last, actually, Deanna, who was one of our DDR friends.

1662
01:59:41,665 --> 01:59:42,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Deanna.

1663
01:59:42,526 --> 01:59:43,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Does she listen to the show?

1664
01:59:43,567 --> 01:59:44,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not, but hi anyway.

1665
01:59:44,948 --> 01:59:46,409
[SPEAKER_03]: She's at a baseball game tonight in Fresno.

1666
01:59:46,549 --> 01:59:46,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1667
01:59:47,149 --> 01:59:48,030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you're going to Fresno?

1668
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:48,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1669
01:59:48,749 --> 01:59:49,209
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1670
02:00:04,955 --> 02:00:10,718
[SPEAKER_03]: and I swear I tilted the machine or I almost tilted the machine just because I wasn't expecting it.

1671
02:00:10,738 --> 02:00:12,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so loud.

1672
02:00:12,079 --> 02:00:17,002
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that new pinball players should know about too is that tilting the machine is okay.

1673
02:00:17,982 --> 02:00:19,243
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about finding the right balance.

1674
02:00:19,303 --> 02:00:24,606
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't slam the thing too much but a little smack, you just gotta slap it on the ass a little bit.

1675
02:00:25,566 --> 02:00:28,048
[SPEAKER_08]: to get those balls right where you gotta get them.

1676
02:00:28,108 --> 02:00:31,170
[SPEAKER_03]: The sweet spot for most tables is gonna be right past the flipper.

1677
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:33,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about that sweet spot.

1678
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:33,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1679
02:00:34,271 --> 02:00:37,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And you use the bottom of your palm.

1680
02:00:37,493 --> 02:00:37,774
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1681
02:00:37,914 --> 02:00:38,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1682
02:00:40,375 --> 02:00:41,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's left.

1683
02:00:44,998 --> 02:00:45,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't help it.

1684
02:00:46,119 --> 02:00:47,960
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about the sweet spot.

1685
02:00:50,829 --> 02:00:51,649
[SPEAKER_08]: How about the listeners?

1686
02:00:51,709 --> 02:00:53,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the listeners on Facebook.

1687
02:00:54,611 --> 02:00:58,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Burr says, My favorite pinball game of all time is Pinball Construction Set.

1688
02:00:58,972 --> 02:01:01,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved making my own pinball tables on my Apple II.

1689
02:01:02,274 --> 02:01:04,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the hell is the Kickstarter for a remake?

1690
02:01:04,715 --> 02:01:08,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear ya, except replace Apple II with Commodore 64, and that was me.

1691
02:01:08,976 --> 02:01:09,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was awesome.

1692
02:01:09,596 --> 02:01:14,318
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a Sega game, too, where you can make a Genesis game that you could make pinball tables.

1693
02:01:14,338 --> 02:01:15,299
[SPEAKER_08]: They did, didn't they?

1694
02:01:15,459 --> 02:01:18,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what it was called, but I remember at the back of the box they had one that was like

1695
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:22,762
[SPEAKER_06]: One bumper and all the flippers you could possibly fit on the screen.

1696
02:01:23,282 --> 02:01:23,922
[SPEAKER_06]: All flippers.

1697
02:01:23,962 --> 02:01:24,723
[SPEAKER_06]: That is all it was.

1698
02:01:25,263 --> 02:01:30,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Fabrice A says, Sadly, pinball machines have become even more rare than arcade cabinets.

1699
02:01:30,965 --> 02:01:32,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I do enjoy pinball a lot.

1700
02:01:32,706 --> 02:01:34,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you know how to score big, it's super addictive.

1701
02:01:35,047 --> 02:01:36,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played my fair share of pinball tables.

1702
02:01:36,848 --> 02:01:41,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Independence Day, High Roller, The Simpsons, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Lord of the Rings, and the list goes on.

1703
02:01:41,490 --> 02:01:43,591
[SPEAKER_08]: The one I enjoyed the most was The Addams Family.

1704
02:01:44,031 --> 02:01:44,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Very intricate.

1705
02:01:45,832 --> 02:01:48,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Game of Thrones

1706
02:02:08,267 --> 02:02:33,873
[SPEAKER_08]: um Shattered Hawk says the girlfriend and I go to the Nickel Cade about once or twice a month we spend most of the time playing the Star Trek and Addams Family pinball games and lastly Edgar R says I love pinball I never passed up the Simpsons at my old local pub again those are just some of the answers from Facebook and Google Plus sorry I didn't have time to read them all and I tonight I kind of pick people that don't usually get in chat and I don't usually hear from on the show in other ways trying to spread the love around a little bit so uh

1707
02:02:34,253 --> 02:02:41,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I do encourage all our listeners though to read the complete list of answers at facebook.com Metallica Pinball is the last one facebook.com they have a Metallica Pinball?

1708
02:02:41,503 --> 02:02:48,773
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah they're gonna fuck that up I think they also did a Kiss Pinball as well hold on that's cool alright

1709
02:02:50,098 --> 02:02:52,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into some other news.

1710
02:02:52,079 --> 02:02:53,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess it's my turn for other news, too.

1711
02:02:53,639 --> 02:02:57,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo possibly going into more free-to-play software.

1712
02:02:57,701 --> 02:03:08,064
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say we heard this rumor before, but this is about something that happened with Satoru Iwata, and I think it was in an interview that was actually on Nintendo.co.jp.

1713
02:03:09,004 --> 02:03:12,645
[SPEAKER_08]: The company is looking beyond digital distribution and is thinking about free-to-play games.

1714
02:03:13,206 --> 02:03:13,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Question.

1715
02:03:14,466 --> 02:03:14,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the answer.

1716
02:03:42,515 --> 02:03:48,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, as you pointed out, we think the digital distribution of package software is only the first step in expanding our digital business.

1717
02:03:49,039 --> 02:03:52,881
[SPEAKER_08]: We will not simply change our existing package software distribution channel.

1718
02:03:53,302 --> 02:03:57,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Rather, we might have many other types of business models in addition to package software.

1719
02:03:58,325 --> 02:04:05,989
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, we might see more games that are similar to free-to-play games, games that cost much less, or games that require a monthly subscription fee.

1720
02:04:06,550 --> 02:04:08,331
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be Uncharted territory for Nintendo.

1721
02:04:09,071 --> 02:04:23,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Digitalization allows for greater flexibility whereby having more ways to make payments both software developers and consumers have more options and Nintendo 3DS and Wii U have flexible systems to handle such treads so it is now a question of putting these ideas into action.

1722
02:04:23,925 --> 02:04:31,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I can definitely say that Nintendo will make new offers that go well beyond simply replacing packaged software with digital software.

1723
02:04:32,293 --> 02:04:48,973
[SPEAKER_08]: hmm hmm now that doesn't necessarily mean free to play but certainly they are looking at mixing things up a little bit and not just being digital versions of the same same stuff I think Jamie's next story ties into this a little bit as well so I'll let her go next and we'll come back to this okay well

1724
02:04:49,622 --> 02:04:51,303
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1725
02:05:07,313 --> 02:05:08,233
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1726
02:05:22,899 --> 02:05:29,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no idea that this was... I guess I tweeted about it because I'm like, whoa, the Wii U thing lets you go inside places now.

1727
02:05:29,547 --> 02:05:33,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And somebody responded and said, actually, Google added that a while ago.

1728
02:05:33,151 --> 02:05:34,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I missed that.

1729
02:05:34,032 --> 02:05:35,253
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's crazy.

1730
02:05:35,294 --> 02:05:36,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I have to ask.

1731
02:05:36,054 --> 02:05:38,057
[SPEAKER_06]: The software I know is free right now.

1732
02:05:38,277 --> 02:05:38,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1733
02:05:39,838 --> 02:05:41,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not going to be free forever.

1734
02:05:41,959 --> 02:05:44,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this something that someone would actually pay for?

1735
02:05:44,161 --> 02:05:45,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because it seems kind of dumb.

1736
02:05:46,041 --> 02:05:47,602
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because it's a little choppy.

1737
02:05:47,742 --> 02:05:48,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's neat.

1738
02:05:48,743 --> 02:05:50,764
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a really neat concept.

1739
02:05:51,544 --> 02:05:56,127
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's probably like internet browser where it's going to be free for forever and then they'll charge for it at some point.

1740
02:05:56,187 --> 02:05:57,227
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.

1741
02:05:57,787 --> 02:06:00,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they have this other thing that they're charging for that are videos.

1742
02:06:00,889 --> 02:06:08,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you can download a video of a double-decker tour thing going through parts of London and you can do the whole pan around with the thing.

1743
02:06:09,193 --> 02:06:14,118
[SPEAKER_08]: But they want to charge you like $1.50 for a couple minute, essentially like a two minute video.

1744
02:06:14,139 --> 02:06:14,839
[SPEAKER_08]: That's silly.

1745
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:18,944
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a demo that has a little bit of all of them and that's well enough.

1746
02:06:19,224 --> 02:06:19,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry, Jamie.

1747
02:06:22,090 --> 02:06:40,542
[SPEAKER_03]: for people who own a Wii U there is a freebie out there Tank Tank Tank is free on the Wii U eShop and then there's paid DLC and then there's also Kung Fu Rabbit so there also are virtual console updates with other games including and these aren't free by the way

1748
02:06:41,022 --> 02:06:43,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man and Mega Man are five bucks a pop.

1749
02:06:44,808 --> 02:06:48,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were also, let's see, there's some sales.

1750
02:06:48,693 --> 02:06:51,057
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Nano Assault Neo, Zen Pinball 2.

1751
02:06:51,898 --> 02:06:54,762
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the 3DS, there will be Bear Shark.

1752
02:06:55,223 --> 02:06:55,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Bear Shark.

1753
02:06:56,904 --> 02:07:24,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Gummy Bear's Magical Medallion My Writing Stable's 3D Armageddon Operation Dragon Balloon Fight On sale will be Marvel Pinball 3D 3D Classics Kirby's Adventure Dylan's Rolling Western Pushmo Fluidity Spin Cycle Tokyo Crash Mobs Nano Assault EX Art of Balance Touch Fun Fun Mini Golf Touch Cool

1754
02:07:25,686 --> 02:07:25,986
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1755
02:07:26,426 --> 02:07:27,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I just want to say real quick.

1756
02:07:27,367 --> 02:07:28,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually played the Tank Tank Tank.

1757
02:07:28,807 --> 02:07:34,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I downloaded it because now Nintendo has that cutting edge technology where it finally downloads things in the background.

1758
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:36,431
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just set it up to download the one gig thing, whatever.

1759
02:07:36,951 --> 02:07:40,133
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really crippled because you can't even do story mode in it.

1760
02:07:40,313 --> 02:07:43,514
[SPEAKER_08]: All you can do is you can do like the versus mode or whatever, like three times a day.

1761
02:07:43,935 --> 02:07:44,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of silly.

1762
02:07:45,475 --> 02:07:47,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, there's not a lot to it.

1763
02:07:47,576 --> 02:07:51,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, I was, you can't do it online or anything.

1764
02:07:51,238 --> 02:07:55,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what's the point of Tank Tank Tank with the silly pictures if you can't play it online?

1765
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:55,380
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a

1766
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:55,840
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

1767
02:08:19,236 --> 02:08:20,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, let me put it this way.

1768
02:08:22,681 --> 02:08:29,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the whole time limit demo thing for multiple plays is stupid.

1769
02:08:30,512 --> 02:08:33,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Saints Row, when that first came out as a demo, was a 30 minute demo.

1770
02:08:33,697 --> 02:08:34,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the crap out of it.

1771
02:08:34,798 --> 02:08:36,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I played it over and over and over again.

1772
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:37,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It got me really hyped up about the game.

1773
02:08:37,861 --> 02:08:44,927
[SPEAKER_06]: If I was only limited to play that three times a day, say, oh, hey, I want to show my friend this game that's really awesome that I'm super hyped up about.

1774
02:08:45,047 --> 02:08:48,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck, I can't play it until tomorrow because they're being fucktards about it.

1775
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:50,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's stupid.

1776
02:08:50,591 --> 02:08:52,433
[SPEAKER_08]: YY Orange Hat says, got news for you.

1777
02:08:52,493 --> 02:08:54,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Tank Tank Tank's retail version doesn't have online play either.

1778
02:08:55,355 --> 02:08:59,258
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I feared that, and how derpy dumb is that?

1779
02:08:59,438 --> 02:09:03,382
[SPEAKER_08]: That should have been an obvious thing to put in the game, but no.

1780
02:09:03,902 --> 02:09:10,064
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems to me like that's a game though that, and I was excited about it for a while, but it just seems like it would lose something being outside of the arcade too.

1781
02:09:10,584 --> 02:09:14,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, especially when you're sitting in the house playing it by yourself, which is not the same, you know?

1782
02:09:14,286 --> 02:09:15,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no one wants to play by themselves, Rob.

1783
02:09:16,106 --> 02:09:19,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, apparently Breakman does, if you remember earlier.

1784
02:09:19,587 --> 02:09:21,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing with yourself really should only be like, never mind.

1785
02:09:23,148 --> 02:09:26,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked playing it in the arcade because I could just reach over and smack Dan in the head.

1786
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:28,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes.

1787
02:09:28,570 --> 02:09:31,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I like taking the pictures with the little wigs and things.

1788
02:09:31,771 --> 02:09:33,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan said I look like Nicki Minaj in one of them.

1789
02:09:34,153 --> 02:09:34,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1790
02:09:35,675 --> 02:09:40,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, one of my old live journal icons is the little tank with the squid in it going, thank you.

1791
02:09:42,423 --> 02:09:42,643
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1792
02:09:43,324 --> 02:09:43,585
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1793
02:09:43,905 --> 02:09:44,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on, Loki.

1794
02:09:45,567 --> 02:09:45,947
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1795
02:09:47,009 --> 02:09:48,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's see.

1796
02:09:48,090 --> 02:09:48,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's...

1797
02:09:49,574 --> 02:09:50,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty Ghosts

1798
02:10:16,234 --> 02:10:21,680
[SPEAKER_06]: No Wii U version was announced, and I can also confirm that there is no Wii U version as of right now.

1799
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:27,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it's something that they're saving for some Wii U thing that they're going to say, Oh, by the way, it's Wii U now, too.

1800
02:10:27,525 --> 02:10:31,069
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just don't know if they made their money back on the Wii U version.

1801
02:10:31,089 --> 02:10:33,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what a lot of these companies are coming to decide.

1802
02:10:33,892 --> 02:10:36,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, hey, we're not really making a lot of money on it.

1803
02:10:36,154 --> 02:10:36,334
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

1804
02:10:37,655 --> 02:10:54,646
[SPEAKER_06]: uh apparently it's going to revolve around you know uh Ghost from Modern Warfare 2 and um they did say that the new on the next gen game or version of the game is going to have a brand new engine current gen version sorry it's going to be running on the same engine that Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3 I think are running on so

1805
02:10:56,418 --> 02:10:56,878
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1806
02:11:14,457 --> 02:11:31,709
[SPEAKER_06]: you know the single player campaign might be cool because now I'm going back and playing through all the single player campaigns from them but as long as the multiplayer is fun that's I don't know I really wish they would just put a multiplayer version of that only make it like maybe half the price or something but then of course they'd be cutting out profits profits profits profits

1807
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:34,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow.

1808
02:11:35,941 --> 02:11:37,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited, you guys.

1809
02:11:37,101 --> 02:11:40,362
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been forever since we've been able to do a segment like this.

1810
02:11:40,982 --> 02:11:44,563
[SPEAKER_08]: The way this segment ties to games is really loose, but you know what?

1811
02:11:44,764 --> 02:11:48,825
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to bring in an opportunity to make fun of local news!

1812
02:11:52,296 --> 02:11:53,378
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1813
02:12:09,517 --> 02:12:11,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to win an Xbox Kinect.

1814
02:12:11,778 --> 02:12:15,959
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only way this ties to video games is that the ultimate prize was an Xbox Kinect.

1815
02:12:15,979 --> 02:12:20,140
[SPEAKER_08]: But you guys, this story is freaking priceless.

1816
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:21,020
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too dumb to be real.

1817
02:12:21,121 --> 02:12:22,161
[SPEAKER_08]: It's priceless.

1818
02:12:22,521 --> 02:12:23,841
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me think of The Onion.

1819
02:12:24,061 --> 02:12:28,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Courtesy of ABC40 coming out of, where are they based?

1820
02:12:28,283 --> 02:12:28,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Springfield.

1821
02:12:29,623 --> 02:12:30,623
[SPEAKER_08]: and Fox 6.

1822
02:12:30,743 --> 02:12:32,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they're owned by the same people.

1823
02:12:32,344 --> 02:12:32,884
[SPEAKER_08]: So here you go.

1824
02:12:32,944 --> 02:12:33,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Courtesy of these guys.

1825
02:12:34,324 --> 02:12:35,465
[SPEAKER_08]: A clip from the local news.

1826
02:12:35,505 --> 02:12:37,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I've searched years for the perfect mattress.

1827
02:12:37,845 --> 02:12:39,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care about the perfect mattress.

1828
02:12:39,926 --> 02:12:41,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Mattress hunter.

1829
02:12:41,206 --> 02:12:43,307
[SPEAKER_08]: He searched for the perfect mattress.

1830
02:12:43,387 --> 02:12:44,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say local commercials.

1831
02:12:45,028 --> 02:12:46,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I said local news.

1832
02:12:46,188 --> 02:12:48,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Badly animated flash animation.

1833
02:12:48,309 --> 02:12:48,589
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1834
02:12:49,589 --> 02:12:49,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1835
02:12:51,758 --> 02:13:01,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Henry Gribholm says he lost his life savings, $2,600, on a carnival game and all he has to show for it is this stuffed banana with dreadlocks.

1836
02:13:07,165 --> 02:13:11,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Gribbom says he attended a Manchester carnival run by Fiesta Shows and wanted to win an Xbox Kinect at a game called Tubs of Fun.

1837
02:13:37,927 --> 02:13:39,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right next to the pinball.

1838
02:13:40,110 --> 02:13:42,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm willing to bet it's probably not actually Kinect.

1839
02:13:42,913 --> 02:13:47,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing it's probably an Xbox console with Kinect, I'm thinking.

1840
02:13:47,138 --> 02:13:48,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Because how else could you justify $2,600?

1841
02:13:48,740 --> 02:13:50,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking that it's a little misrepresented.

1842
02:13:50,802 --> 02:13:51,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Tubs of fun!

1843
02:13:56,849 --> 02:14:01,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry guys, this is at max volume, so I apologize, this is a little low.

1844
02:14:01,271 --> 02:14:01,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

1845
02:14:14,079 --> 02:14:15,641
[SPEAKER_08]: The balls kept popping out.

1846
02:14:15,921 --> 02:14:20,786
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of those games, it's clearly that game where you throw the baseball into the little, it's like the angled bucket, right?

1847
02:14:20,967 --> 02:14:21,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of skee-ball-ish.

1848
02:14:22,168 --> 02:14:25,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I'm sure they switched the ball on you at the last minute or whatever.

1849
02:14:25,672 --> 02:14:28,475
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not possible that it wasn't rigged.

1850
02:14:30,326 --> 02:14:42,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they have this guy walking down the street, pushing his baby in the stroller with this giant banana with dreadlocks?

1851
02:14:42,354 --> 02:14:43,675
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what cracks me up.

1852
02:14:44,015 --> 02:14:47,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know why they're giving this fuckwad any attention at all.

1853
02:14:48,278 --> 02:14:49,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's so ridiculous.

1854
02:14:49,859 --> 02:14:50,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because it's funny.

1855
02:14:51,995 --> 02:14:53,476
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not funny, it's sad.

1856
02:14:53,977 --> 02:14:55,918
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like those gambling people, you know?

1857
02:14:56,339 --> 02:15:00,343
[SPEAKER_00]: ...at $2,300 more, and soon lost all that as well.

1858
02:15:00,863 --> 02:15:01,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a difficult game.

1859
02:15:02,505 --> 02:15:03,626
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've tried it myself.

1860
02:15:03,686 --> 02:15:05,528
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it once, missed probably 20 times.

1861
02:15:05,768 --> 02:15:11,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiesta Show says the game is run by an independent contractor who's worked for Fiesta for years.

1862
02:15:11,494 --> 02:15:13,956
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interviewing the contractor to see what happens.

1863
02:15:14,349 --> 02:15:16,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Queen Simia in our chatroom brings up a good point.

1864
02:15:16,810 --> 02:15:18,951
[SPEAKER_08]: On the plus side, that's a really big banana.

1865
02:15:19,691 --> 02:15:20,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Literally, that's what she said.

1866
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:38,924
[SPEAKER_06]: because he's taking a vacation because he's just made $2,300.

1867
02:15:39,044 --> 02:15:41,107
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, fuck that.

1868
02:15:41,147 --> 02:15:42,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I can skip this next one.

1869
02:15:42,249 --> 02:15:43,170
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the seriousness of that.

1870
02:15:43,230 --> 02:15:46,795
[SPEAKER_08]: You will not see tubs of fun or any fun whatsoever.

1871
02:15:47,256 --> 02:15:49,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's... Is this the Daily Show right now?

1872
02:15:52,016 --> 02:15:54,297
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I thought this was onion-worthy.

1873
02:15:55,277 --> 02:16:04,541
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I had $2,600 as my savings, and I wanted an Xbox... But Jamie, he was just addicted.

1874
02:16:04,601 --> 02:16:06,061
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to keep doubling down.

1875
02:16:06,121 --> 02:16:07,722
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to win that money back.

1876
02:16:07,762 --> 02:16:10,043
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's a fucking idiot.

1877
02:16:10,203 --> 02:16:10,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Allegedly.

1878
02:16:10,683 --> 02:16:11,643
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm saying it.

1879
02:16:12,064 --> 02:16:12,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going on record.

1880
02:16:13,324 --> 02:16:18,566
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, sir, Mr. Banana, you are tubs of stupid.

1881
02:16:18,926 --> 02:16:38,060
[SPEAKER_06]: and now he has this giant banana he's gotta feed to as well as his children I mean a banana of that size is gonna eat a lot of food Donkey Kong is coming for you that's a lot of potassium and maybe listen to a lot of reggae and smoke some stuff independent contractor that runs the game is not allowed to set up

1882
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:40,843
[SPEAKER_01]: while an investigation is taking place.

1883
02:16:41,263 --> 02:16:43,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you get caught up in the whole double or nothing.

1884
02:16:43,545 --> 02:16:46,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to win my money back.

1885
02:16:46,428 --> 02:16:47,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Notice something about this shot.

1886
02:16:47,989 --> 02:16:50,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, I want to point this out to you while this guy is being interviewed.

1887
02:16:50,892 --> 02:16:57,138
[SPEAKER_08]: The baby is left alone in the stroller with only the banana to comfort him and he's struggling to get out.

1888
02:16:58,359 --> 02:16:59,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see what Bobby just linked in chat?

1889
02:17:00,041 --> 02:17:00,281
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1890
02:17:00,341 --> 02:17:00,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what?

1891
02:17:02,543 --> 02:17:09,049
[SPEAKER_03]: College Humor wants to pay $2,600 for a giant dreadlock stuffed banana.

1892
02:17:09,109 --> 02:17:09,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course!

1893
02:17:09,869 --> 02:17:10,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course!

1894
02:17:10,510 --> 02:17:13,132
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy will end up making a profit off this story.

1895
02:17:13,152 --> 02:17:14,233
[SPEAKER_08]: He will sell it on eBay.

1896
02:17:14,353 --> 02:17:15,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

1897
02:17:15,514 --> 02:17:18,397
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we are in debt because of Orange Lounge Radio.

1898
02:17:18,417 --> 02:17:19,037
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just an idiot.

1899
02:17:19,077 --> 02:17:19,698
[SPEAKER_06]: He's an idiot.

1900
02:17:19,818 --> 02:17:21,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you try... I mean, come on.

1901
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that you may have gotten caught up in the moment, but...

1902
02:17:26,123 --> 02:17:26,463
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1903
02:17:45,129 --> 02:17:45,549
Yes, you can.

1904
02:17:45,990 --> 02:17:46,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really, bitch?

1905
02:17:47,170 --> 02:17:47,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.

1906
02:17:48,271 --> 02:17:54,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can get things that are equally as ridiculous, like Circus Circus and Excalibur have all those little games in the basement.

1907
02:17:55,256 --> 02:17:56,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to know who... Hold on, hold on.

1908
02:17:56,917 --> 02:17:59,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragenator in chat says, will he get a hammock for that banana?

1909
02:17:59,899 --> 02:18:00,680
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question.

1910
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:02,361
[SPEAKER_08]: It's big enough.

1911
02:18:02,781 --> 02:18:07,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Blackwolf wants to know, or Blackwolf suggests, we need a giant orange with dreadlocks.

1912
02:18:07,885 --> 02:18:08,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Instant money.

1913
02:18:08,485 --> 02:18:09,065
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Bobby?

1914
02:18:09,145 --> 02:18:10,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make that for 15 bucks.

1915
02:18:11,107 --> 02:18:11,507
Okay.

1916
02:18:11,787 --> 02:18:12,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it too.

1917
02:18:12,768 --> 02:18:15,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Who designs these stuff things?

1918
02:18:15,729 --> 02:18:17,530
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, what is it, like a dartboard?

1919
02:18:17,550 --> 02:18:18,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Really bored people.

1920
02:18:18,271 --> 02:18:22,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a dartboard that says, you know, fruit and an accessory.

1921
02:18:22,693 --> 02:18:27,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Banana, dreadlocks, orange, cowboy hat.

1922
02:18:27,696 --> 02:18:28,797
[SPEAKER_03]: They should freaking hire me.

1923
02:18:28,897 --> 02:18:30,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I could design some really disturbing stuff.

1924
02:18:30,938 --> 02:18:31,538
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chinese.

1925
02:18:32,539 --> 02:18:34,260
[SPEAKER_01]: He went back the next day to complain.

1926
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:36,441
[SPEAKER_01]: and the man running the game gave him back $600.

1927
02:18:36,541 --> 02:18:39,983
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's the crazy... The guy gave him back $600?

1928
02:18:40,183 --> 02:18:42,465
[SPEAKER_08]: What carny gives you money back?

1929
02:18:43,766 --> 02:18:45,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel sorry for you here.

1930
02:18:45,387 --> 02:18:47,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's where the story gets shady.

1931
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:48,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did the carny give him money back?

1932
02:18:48,709 --> 02:18:52,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably because he's like, I bet my life savings and the guy felt a little bit bad.

1933
02:18:52,391 --> 02:18:55,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how much... The guy is just making cash.

1934
02:18:55,413 --> 02:18:56,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he's not losing any.

1935
02:18:56,593 --> 02:18:57,994
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing to really run this game.

1936
02:18:58,014 --> 02:18:58,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's wrap this up.

1937
02:18:59,055 --> 02:19:01,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Henry split with the banana and the cash.

1938
02:19:01,857 --> 02:19:03,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, thank you for working that pun in.

1939
02:19:04,598 --> 02:19:05,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank you.

1940
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:08,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I was worried that there might not be a pun.

1941
02:19:08,282 --> 02:19:09,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you, local news.

1942
02:19:09,723 --> 02:19:11,444
[SPEAKER_08]: He split with a banana.

1943
02:19:11,825 --> 02:19:14,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And filed a report with Manchester PD.

1944
02:19:14,627 --> 02:19:16,709
[SPEAKER_05]: For once in my life, I happen to become that sucker.

1945
02:19:17,730 --> 02:19:18,751
[SPEAKER_03]: At least he admits it.

1946
02:19:25,134 --> 02:19:25,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1947
02:19:43,221 --> 02:19:50,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear College Humor, give me $2,600 and I will draw you a banana with dreadlocks.

1948
02:19:50,586 --> 02:19:51,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go find you that banana.

1949
02:19:51,927 --> 02:19:54,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we can purchase it on the internet.

1950
02:19:54,849 --> 02:19:59,973
[SPEAKER_08]: With $2,600, I'll buy a plane ticket to Hong Kong and go find the manufacturer factory and get one.

1951
02:20:00,013 --> 02:20:01,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me finish my plea for a job.

1952
02:20:02,474 --> 02:20:06,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear College Humor, contract me for $2,600 to do nothing but make fun of this guy.

1953
02:20:08,318 --> 02:20:10,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise you I could do it for days on end.

1954
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:12,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never get tired.

1955
02:20:14,169 --> 02:20:16,811
[SPEAKER_08]: YYR says that was some hardcore punography.

1956
02:20:18,071 --> 02:20:19,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Punography.

1957
02:20:20,673 --> 02:20:22,094
[SPEAKER_08]: It would only be if the pun was written.

1958
02:20:23,234 --> 02:20:24,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the mailbag.

1959
02:20:24,415 --> 02:20:27,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what lovely puns await us in the mailbag.

1960
02:20:28,317 --> 02:20:30,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1961
02:20:31,179 --> 02:20:36,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick a few of our favorite emails and read them here on the show.

1962
02:20:36,702 --> 02:20:38,643
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what do we have tonight?

1963
02:20:39,801 --> 02:20:41,065
[SPEAKER_03]: People Trippin'.

1964
02:20:41,847 --> 02:20:44,796
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is titled, Damn Used Games.

1965
02:20:46,650 --> 02:20:51,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And this comes from someone with a very unpronounceable name, so I'm just going to say, read the email.

1966
02:20:51,771 --> 02:20:54,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, OLRcast, my name is Zyle Scott.

1967
02:20:54,812 --> 02:20:55,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1968
02:20:55,112 --> 02:20:55,832
[SPEAKER_08]: You said the name.

1969
02:20:56,133 --> 02:20:57,813
[SPEAKER_03]: He sold me to you.

1970
02:20:57,833 --> 02:21:00,514
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put your name in the body of the email, I'm going to read it, okay?

1971
02:21:01,274 --> 02:21:12,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering if any of you guys know of a website that I could print out cover art for used games that have lost their, it's not T-H-E-R-E, it's T-H-E-I-R, original case.

1972
02:21:13,257 --> 02:21:16,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently bought a shitload of PS1 games and none of them have cover art.

1973
02:21:17,220 --> 02:21:18,621
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me sad and annoyed.

1974
02:21:19,161 --> 02:21:21,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, thanks and keep on with the great work.

1975
02:21:21,323 --> 02:21:21,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Hugs and shit.

1976
02:21:23,424 --> 02:21:25,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know of any sites per se.

1977
02:21:25,766 --> 02:21:27,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazon, maybe, question mark.

1978
02:21:27,467 --> 02:21:28,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even.

1979
02:21:29,028 --> 02:21:30,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, you know what I do in his position?

1980
02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:34,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Just go to Google Limits search and search for the game.

1981
02:21:34,892 --> 02:21:35,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for large.

1982
02:21:35,733 --> 02:21:36,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for large.

1983
02:21:36,494 --> 02:21:37,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and do large.

1984
02:21:38,095 --> 02:21:41,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't blow up a medium size because it'll look terrible when you print it out.

1985
02:21:41,488 --> 02:21:47,570
[SPEAKER_03]: or you can pay me $2,600 and I will go get all the shit printed for you at King Ghost and it will all be nice.

1986
02:21:48,671 --> 02:21:50,611
[SPEAKER_03]: You pay me triple that and I'll redraw it all for you.

1987
02:21:51,372 --> 02:21:54,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, yeah, Google Image Search is what I would use.

1988
02:21:54,893 --> 02:21:56,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Worst case scenario, Amazon.

1989
02:21:57,074 --> 02:21:59,595
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you find a lot of missing CD covers.

1990
02:21:59,675 --> 02:22:02,456
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't want it to look shitty, look for Hi-Rez.

1991
02:22:03,136 --> 02:22:05,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Queen Simia in our chatroom says, draw your own.

1992
02:22:05,198 --> 02:22:05,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the best.

1993
02:22:05,999 --> 02:22:07,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1994
02:22:07,400 --> 02:22:18,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Dracula X copy that Krista made us back in the day has her little stick figure Richter Belmont with flaily arms and a whip.

1995
02:22:18,329 --> 02:22:19,630
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you know what this guy needs?

1996
02:22:19,730 --> 02:22:24,273
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy needs video game covers done in Comic Sans and clip art.

1997
02:22:24,854 --> 02:22:24,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah!

1998
02:22:25,554 --> 02:22:26,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen this?

1999
02:22:26,395 --> 02:22:27,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I have.

2000
02:22:27,095 --> 02:22:28,676
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you need, sir.

2001
02:22:28,756 --> 02:22:34,840
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to just forego the original covers and get comic sans and clip art redoes, reimaginings, because they're better.

2002
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:35,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it yourself.

2003
02:22:35,701 --> 02:22:36,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be a fun project.

2004
02:22:36,622 --> 02:22:37,162
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

2005
02:22:37,983 --> 02:22:38,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

2006
02:22:38,903 --> 02:22:39,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Make the best out of it.

2007
02:22:39,744 --> 02:22:41,565
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, Rob, those make baby Satan cry.

2008
02:22:43,726 --> 02:22:44,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Make baby Satan cry.

2009
02:22:44,987 --> 02:22:45,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2010
02:22:45,087 --> 02:22:46,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Little fiery tears.

2011
02:22:46,661 --> 02:22:47,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Little Tears of Lava

2012
02:23:04,959 --> 02:23:08,944
[SPEAKER_08]: $150?

2013
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:08,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that guy got a pretty good deal then.

2014
02:23:08,984 --> 02:23:10,545
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he didn't.

2015
02:23:11,226 --> 02:23:13,409
[SPEAKER_08]: He got $600 of his bucks back and then $150.

2016
02:23:14,550 --> 02:23:16,372
[SPEAKER_08]: He only lost two-thirds of his money.

2017
02:23:17,113 --> 02:23:18,415
[SPEAKER_08]: For a carnival, that's not bad.

2018
02:23:20,285 --> 02:23:22,226
[SPEAKER_08]: and he had tubs of fun, people.

2019
02:23:22,466 --> 02:23:24,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Tubs of fun.

2020
02:23:24,588 --> 02:23:29,890
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, I need to find those covers that Krista drew me back in the day and scan them in because they're freaking hilarious.

2021
02:23:30,731 --> 02:23:33,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the one for Emerald Dragon that was pretty funny too.

2022
02:23:33,272 --> 02:23:37,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Dungeon Buster in chat says someone who missed out on the Ni No Kuni Wizards book made his own.

2023
02:23:37,075 --> 02:23:37,675
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awesome.

2024
02:23:39,313 --> 02:23:42,834
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can still hire me and I will be more than happy to lay out anything you want me to.

2025
02:23:42,854 --> 02:23:43,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it go.

2026
02:23:43,474 --> 02:23:44,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Get to the next email.

2027
02:23:44,535 --> 02:23:47,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I've actually got a job option.

2028
02:23:47,616 --> 02:23:49,277
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

2029
02:23:49,337 --> 02:23:51,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Just print your own Bananas with Dreadlocks for the cover.

2030
02:23:52,038 --> 02:23:53,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy VII, Banana with Dreadlocks.

2031
02:23:54,519 --> 02:23:57,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Banana with Spiky Mohawk for Final Fantasy VII.

2032
02:23:57,700 --> 02:23:59,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be crying.

2033
02:23:59,861 --> 02:24:03,203
[SPEAKER_06]: This year, instead of Spaced Ponchos, it's all about Bananas with Dreadlocks.

2034
02:24:03,723 --> 02:24:04,743
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going to be the new trend.

2035
02:24:04,763 --> 02:24:04,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

2036
02:24:07,358 --> 02:24:09,739
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually, I was thinking of applying for the River Cats.

2037
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:11,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah?

2038
02:24:11,320 --> 02:24:12,381
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a marketing position open.

2039
02:24:12,641 --> 02:24:13,001
[SPEAKER_08]: They do.

2040
02:24:13,621 --> 02:24:15,462
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a full year, full time.

2041
02:24:15,582 --> 02:24:19,645
[SPEAKER_08]: My mom was telling me to go for an announcer position with them some time ago, and I was like, really?

2042
02:24:19,705 --> 02:24:20,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Me announcing baseball?

2043
02:24:20,825 --> 02:24:22,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you really see that?

2044
02:24:22,426 --> 02:24:23,006
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be hilarious.

2045
02:24:23,026 --> 02:24:27,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the guy, hit the ball, and things happen, and somebody just caught it.

2046
02:24:27,349 --> 02:24:28,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God, y'all.

2047
02:24:28,369 --> 02:24:29,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Balls are flying everywhere.

2048
02:24:34,272 --> 02:24:36,913
[SPEAKER_03]: The pitcher just hit the batter.

2049
02:24:37,793 --> 02:24:38,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Girl.

2050
02:24:39,934 --> 02:24:40,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

2051
02:24:40,834 --> 02:24:42,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, next email, dammit.

2052
02:24:42,415 --> 02:24:43,295
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have one more.

2053
02:24:44,236 --> 02:24:45,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, OLR.

2054
02:24:45,516 --> 02:24:49,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got... What was that?

2055
02:24:49,678 --> 02:24:51,938
[SPEAKER_03]: You went high and I lost my shit.

2056
02:24:53,459 --> 02:24:55,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I was being nice to the listeners.

2057
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:56,840
[SPEAKER_08]: You said hello, I said hi.

2058
02:24:56,860 --> 02:24:57,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2059
02:24:59,437 --> 02:25:01,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a question for all the hosts.

2060
02:25:01,938 --> 02:25:11,344
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many games across all generations that have become known for their final boss fights, such as the Doomsday Zone and Sonic 3 and Knuckles or GLaDOS and Portal.

2061
02:25:11,864 --> 02:25:15,566
[SPEAKER_03]: My question to you is which final boss fight in a game is your favorite?

2062
02:25:16,187 --> 02:25:25,332
[SPEAKER_03]: As for mine, I know you guys don't like the game getting a lot of praise, but I absolutely love the final fight against Ganon in The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

2063
02:25:26,052 --> 02:25:49,181
[SPEAKER_03]: from the moment he transforms into the beast that we knew from the previous games in the series the music sends chills down my spine as well as the setting of a fallen castle is surrounded in both flames and the crashes of lightning and thunder across the sky with Zelda standing watch sometimes screaming in fear when Link takes a blow from Ganon if you need your memory refreshed of why I think this fight is so awesome you can watch it here not clicking the link because I know

2064
02:25:49,961 --> 02:25:52,043
[SPEAKER_03]: thanks for reading, Osfer P.S.

2065
02:25:52,063 --> 02:26:16,264
[SPEAKER_08]: this email has been brought to you by me and my everlasting love of the show hosted by the gingerbread man I would say that when I was younger like it was probably this battle yes eat your damn vegetables you stupid frog cause the wart battle was pretty epic at that time like this music was just like oh my god he's gonna kill me

2066
02:26:17,441 --> 02:26:18,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you feed him veggies and it's all good.

2067
02:26:20,026 --> 02:26:23,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, maybe the Kefka battle in Final Fantasy VI was pretty damn epic.

2068
02:26:24,615 --> 02:26:34,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly, not that the battle itself was epic, but the original Metal Gear on the NES, that whole ending sequence was pretty damn amazing.

2069
02:26:35,017 --> 02:26:37,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you mentioned the Kefka battle.

2070
02:26:38,317 --> 02:26:45,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It was waiting for Shadow at the end of the game that was like the big epic teaser.

2071
02:26:46,379 --> 02:26:52,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I liked Final Fantasy VII's final battle because it was so fucking easy and I could make a sandwich.

2072
02:26:53,460 --> 02:26:54,701
[SPEAKER_03]: while the whole thing was on autoplay.

2073
02:26:55,922 --> 02:27:01,385
[SPEAKER_03]: God, there was another one, though, that I remember being completely happy with the ending.

2074
02:27:01,445 --> 02:27:04,427
[SPEAKER_03]: More that I was with the last battle.

2075
02:27:04,487 --> 02:27:04,887
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2076
02:27:05,148 --> 02:27:10,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I always like the last fights, the Wily fights in the Mega Man games because it is the stupidest weapon that you use.

2077
02:27:11,011 --> 02:27:12,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man 3 used Top Man's weapon.

2078
02:27:12,552 --> 02:27:13,133
[SPEAKER_08]: The fuck?

2079
02:27:13,233 --> 02:27:15,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubble Man and Mega Man 2.

2080
02:27:15,054 --> 02:27:16,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but Bubble Lead was actually useful.

2081
02:27:16,975 --> 02:27:21,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was, but to shoot it to kill a boss in an empty room, that sucked.

2082
02:27:23,552 --> 02:27:27,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting Topman and jumping on top of the Wily floater thing.

2083
02:27:27,495 --> 02:27:28,596
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to kill him by topping him.

2084
02:27:28,756 --> 02:27:29,757
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to top his floater.

2085
02:27:32,399 --> 02:27:33,780
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a few.

2086
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:34,181
[SPEAKER_03]: There was.

2087
02:27:34,221 --> 02:27:34,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what about you?

2088
02:27:35,021 --> 02:27:35,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Epic boss battles?

2089
02:27:35,962 --> 02:27:36,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember?

2090
02:27:40,916 --> 02:27:42,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade

2091
02:28:03,936 --> 02:28:04,256
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

2092
02:28:19,256 --> 02:28:20,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

2093
02:28:21,617 --> 02:28:22,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Say your prayers.

2094
02:28:22,477 --> 02:28:25,539
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys gave me money to help them beat the game.

2095
02:28:25,599 --> 02:28:28,660
[SPEAKER_03]: They paid for me to play as Leonardo because I was the only slot open.

2096
02:28:29,140 --> 02:28:31,841
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had just beaten the game and the thing was just starting.

2097
02:28:32,181 --> 02:28:33,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And they turned off all the machines because it was time to go.

2098
02:28:33,742 --> 02:28:34,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2099
02:28:34,402 --> 02:28:34,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Assholes.

2100
02:28:35,322 --> 02:28:36,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I know one epic boss battle.

2101
02:28:36,663 --> 02:28:38,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my revenge because I got to do the same thing.

2102
02:28:38,644 --> 02:28:38,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Max 300.

2103
02:28:38,924 --> 02:28:41,665
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty epic getting to that.

2104
02:28:43,565 --> 02:28:44,606
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I can consider that.

2105
02:28:44,786 --> 02:28:46,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, shoot.

2106
02:28:46,827 --> 02:28:47,547
[SPEAKER_08]: The Legend of Max?

2107
02:28:47,967 --> 02:28:49,528
[SPEAKER_03]: No, um, RoboZ.

2108
02:28:51,790 --> 02:28:52,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, Bust a Move.

2109
02:28:53,812 --> 02:28:57,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember that, you're going through the game and everybody's your size and everything.

2110
02:28:59,936 --> 02:29:01,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull up, pull up, find your soul.

2111
02:29:02,438 --> 02:29:02,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick.

2112
02:29:04,180 --> 02:29:06,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And for anyone who hasn't played the game, like, um...

2113
02:29:08,884 --> 02:29:11,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Busta Move that came out in the U.S.

2114
02:29:13,089 --> 02:29:13,490
[SPEAKER_03]: In the U.S.

2115
02:29:13,530 --> 02:29:14,351
[SPEAKER_03]: it was Busta Groove.

2116
02:29:15,012 --> 02:29:16,193
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan it was Busta Move.

2117
02:29:22,927 --> 02:29:43,219
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're on a building you're this little teeny tiny thing with a robot like this bigger than the building like twice the size of the building it was epic you have cars running off the edges and all this shit and oh my god that was the best game alright good email thank you

2118
02:29:43,875 --> 02:29:48,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to say that Robozy is my number one favorite boss battle.

2119
02:29:48,699 --> 02:29:49,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Good answer.

2120
02:29:49,560 --> 02:29:55,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, if that's it for emails, mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you want to get in on a future email bag segment.

2121
02:29:56,746 --> 02:29:58,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us get to the FUs of the week.

2122
02:29:58,948 --> 02:30:00,890
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the part of the show where we get angsty.

2123
02:30:01,010 --> 02:30:01,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

2124
02:30:03,072 --> 02:30:03,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2125
02:30:18,803 --> 02:30:19,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two.

2126
02:30:20,225 --> 02:30:21,627
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one goes towards me.

2127
02:30:21,667 --> 02:30:22,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm fighting off something.

2128
02:30:23,469 --> 02:30:25,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just probably going to take it easy tomorrow.

2129
02:30:27,214 --> 02:30:36,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that I'm just a little worn down because I've maybe gotten five hours of sleep last night and the night before and then went to the baseball game yesterday and was up all night and busy.

2130
02:30:37,086 --> 02:30:38,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually I have three.

2131
02:30:38,747 --> 02:30:42,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns out that my wheat and corn allergy is a lot worse than I thought.

2132
02:30:43,370 --> 02:30:46,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, the only reason I eat anything wheat today is because I took plenty of Benadryl before the show.

2133
02:30:47,632 --> 02:30:51,034
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that it's definitely going to have to get cut out altogether.

2134
02:30:51,314 --> 02:30:54,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And I keep pushing it and I'm just happier without it, you know.

2135
02:30:55,577 --> 02:30:57,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't stopped me from having ice cream.

2136
02:30:57,378 --> 02:30:59,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I can have ice cream as long as I don't have cookies in my ice cream.

2137
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:01,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Cookies are good though.

2138
02:31:02,341 --> 02:31:05,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I can get gluten free cookies.

2139
02:31:05,363 --> 02:31:05,723
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

2140
02:31:06,597 --> 02:31:13,499
[SPEAKER_03]: and the other one goes towards there not being an actual third Bust-a-Move game.

2141
02:31:15,219 --> 02:31:16,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not counting Dance Summit.

2142
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:17,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not counting Dance Summit.

2143
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:20,141
[SPEAKER_03]: We need an actual new Bust-a-Move game.

2144
02:31:20,541 --> 02:31:32,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Squeenix, dear squa part of Enix, when you absorbed the Enix to become the conglomerate of Squeenix, you also inherited the Bust-a-Move series.

2145
02:31:32,744 --> 02:31:33,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Do something with it!

2146
02:31:34,865 --> 02:31:35,105
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

2147
02:31:35,441 --> 02:31:35,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

2148
02:31:36,761 --> 02:31:37,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I feeded your water.

2149
02:31:38,362 --> 02:31:41,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what it is with your water that makes me have cotton mouth.

2150
02:31:42,383 --> 02:31:43,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get the stuff out of the filter?

2151
02:31:43,863 --> 02:31:44,403
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you need.

2152
02:31:44,763 --> 02:31:45,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Filter water.

2153
02:31:45,404 --> 02:31:46,284
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from the tap.

2154
02:31:46,384 --> 02:31:46,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2155
02:31:47,024 --> 02:31:48,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ever drink tap water.

2156
02:31:48,524 --> 02:31:52,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they do something to control our minds.

2157
02:31:53,706 --> 02:31:54,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it?

2158
02:31:55,086 --> 02:31:55,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it.

2159
02:31:55,788 --> 02:32:00,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and thank you, my son, for trying to hit me in the nuts with the frisbee.

2160
02:32:00,717 --> 02:32:02,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever been headbutted by your son?

2161
02:32:03,923 --> 02:32:05,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but that was in my head.

2162
02:32:07,605 --> 02:32:13,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Becky was telling me about when Julian was like two, he would run in while Chris was playing Xbox games and headbutt him in the crotch.

2163
02:32:13,950 --> 02:32:14,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

2164
02:32:14,710 --> 02:32:15,691
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an accident.

2165
02:32:15,751 --> 02:32:19,794
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't know how to throw a frisbee correctly yet, so he threw it behind him.

2166
02:32:19,995 --> 02:32:20,475
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll learn him.

2167
02:32:21,556 --> 02:32:22,196
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a good kid.

2168
02:32:22,477 --> 02:32:31,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, my FU of the week goes to the fact that Alan made all these french fries before the show and I ate them all and this is why I'm fat.

2169
02:32:31,464 --> 02:32:33,826
[SPEAKER_08]: But they were so good.

2170
02:32:35,512 --> 02:32:40,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Two more stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2171
02:32:41,034 --> 02:32:41,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Two more stories.

2172
02:32:41,674 --> 02:32:41,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

2173
02:32:42,174 --> 02:32:47,055
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they announced a brand new exclusive game coming to the OUYA.

2174
02:32:47,875 --> 02:32:52,977
[SPEAKER_06]: It's being done by Kim Swift and Airtight Games, who did Quantum Conundrum.

2175
02:32:53,517 --> 02:32:54,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul Fjord Soul Fjord

2176
02:33:23,062 --> 02:33:27,563
[SPEAKER_08]: One more story for you guys, and this is about a very interesting demake of a game.

2177
02:33:28,243 --> 02:33:30,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And this kind of blows my mind, actually.

2178
02:33:31,644 --> 02:33:35,545
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, in China, they tend to do this bootleg software.

2179
02:33:36,285 --> 02:33:41,727
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of times it's current titles that they cram into these 8-bit carts, and usually they're hacks or things like that.

2180
02:33:41,767 --> 02:33:45,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, we've seen Tekken, the 8-bit version, and all this crazy shit, right?

2181
02:33:45,047 --> 02:33:45,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Tai Chi, the RPG.

2182
02:33:45,908 --> 02:33:46,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right?

2183
02:33:46,368 --> 02:33:47,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, all this crazy shit, right?

2184
02:33:47,808 --> 02:33:49,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's an interesting one they did recently.

2185
02:33:49,829 --> 02:33:52,291
[SPEAKER_08]: They demaked Final Fantasy IV.

2186
02:33:52,671 --> 02:33:54,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Super Nintendo Final Fantasy IV.

2187
02:33:55,393 --> 02:33:58,395
[SPEAKER_08]: They demade it for the Famicom.

2188
02:33:58,575 --> 02:34:02,578
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a smoker, I have a tip for you.

2189
02:34:02,618 --> 02:34:06,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't play the smoking commercial.

2190
02:34:06,661 --> 02:34:08,282
[SPEAKER_03]: That always made me think of Dennis Leary.

2191
02:34:08,342 --> 02:34:12,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Goddammit, I just wanted to see the stupid demake and I got a stupid commercial.

2192
02:34:12,545 --> 02:34:14,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I want meat from only cows that smoke.

2193
02:34:14,722 --> 02:34:15,022
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

2194
02:34:35,791 --> 02:34:37,711
[SPEAKER_03]: You can whitelist your favorite internet access.

2195
02:34:37,731 --> 02:34:39,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm going to blacklist those sons of bitches.

2196
02:34:39,972 --> 02:34:42,973
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, because if I can't turn the volume down.

2197
02:34:43,033 --> 02:34:51,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, the soundtrack has been shoved into the 8-bit cartridges very well, which is really amazing.

2198
02:34:51,215 --> 02:34:54,956
[SPEAKER_08]: And for 8-bit, it looks pretty good, I got to say.

2199
02:34:55,336 --> 02:34:59,757
[SPEAKER_08]: They've spread it across three cartridges, though, because, you know, Super Nintendo versus Nintendo.

2200
02:35:00,377 --> 02:35:05,278
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the light game, the dark game, and the, I don't know, the end game or something like that.

2201
02:35:05,898 --> 02:35:34,671
[SPEAKER_08]: and because you can't transfer saves from one to the other it basically recaps the story when you start one of the and start your characters at an appropriate level so you can play them in any order you want it's just fascinating that somebody did a lot of work to do that for the Famicom cool imagine if they had focused themselves onto like making an original game I know right so there you go who does original things anymore please

2202
02:35:36,277 --> 02:35:36,737
[SPEAKER_08]: What the Lump

2203
02:35:52,881 --> 02:35:58,506
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2204
02:35:58,526 --> 02:36:01,468
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to give us a call and we can talk about whatever.

2205
02:36:01,488 --> 02:36:07,693
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to talk about demakes, you want to talk about remakes, you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight or something else, give us a call.

2206
02:36:07,813 --> 02:36:11,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2207
02:36:11,856 --> 02:36:14,238
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, I've got some tweets I want to read for you guys.

2208
02:36:15,519 --> 02:36:15,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

2209
02:36:43,712 --> 02:36:44,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's go to the phones.

2210
02:36:44,912 --> 02:36:45,393
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ringing.

2211
02:36:46,633 --> 02:36:47,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

2212
02:36:47,774 --> 02:36:48,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2213
02:36:48,695 --> 02:36:49,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one and only Ranma.

2214
02:36:49,955 --> 02:36:50,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma.

2215
02:36:50,876 --> 02:36:52,016
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

2216
02:36:52,757 --> 02:36:53,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

2217
02:36:53,597 --> 02:36:54,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

2218
02:36:54,738 --> 02:36:56,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know that smoking is bad for you?

2219
02:36:57,900 --> 02:36:58,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, yes it is.

2220
02:36:58,520 --> 02:37:00,922
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I smoke other things, but that's not why I call.

2221
02:37:01,782 --> 02:37:03,483
[SPEAKER_04]: An endorsement from Mr. Spanky.

2222
02:37:03,663 --> 02:37:04,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did you call?

2223
02:37:05,919 --> 02:37:06,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the coffee on.

2224
02:37:06,900 --> 02:37:07,540
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta talk.

2225
02:37:08,821 --> 02:37:09,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get the cheesecake.

2226
02:37:10,903 --> 02:37:11,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Fabulous, darling.

2227
02:37:11,984 --> 02:37:12,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Fabulous.

2228
02:37:13,025 --> 02:37:13,505
[SPEAKER_08]: What is up?

2229
02:37:13,665 --> 02:37:14,426
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you want to talk about?

2230
02:37:14,946 --> 02:37:20,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm coming home on the train and I tune in right about time when you and Loki are talking about piracy and everything.

2231
02:37:22,698 --> 02:37:40,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand both sides of this, because even in my world that I cover, we have to deal with entitlement kids who feel that they shouldn't have to pay for anything because it's quote-unquote free and available, but when those series are licensed, they don't want to pony up the 20 or 30 bucks to buy the entire series.

2232
02:37:40,433 --> 02:37:41,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, you're talking about anime.

2233
02:37:42,394 --> 02:37:42,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2234
02:37:43,235 --> 02:37:46,037
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming to the point, it's a financial aspect, because...

2235
02:37:47,233 --> 02:37:49,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Truth be told, it's just me.

2236
02:37:49,235 --> 02:37:57,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to drop $300 and $400 on a new console knowing that the games are going to be $50, $60, and $70.

2237
02:37:57,764 --> 02:38:00,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's a way to pirate it, so be it.

2238
02:38:01,287 --> 02:38:09,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if the game is like $5, $6, people are still going to pirate it because that's $5, $6 that they're going to keep and put towards something else.

2239
02:38:11,912 --> 02:38:13,213
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2240
02:38:31,795 --> 02:38:35,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I think more people would have bought it at $5 and at $60.

2241
02:38:35,959 --> 02:38:38,120
[SPEAKER_08]: More, but would it be 12 times as many?

2242
02:38:38,181 --> 02:38:40,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's got to be more than 12 times as many.

2243
02:38:40,923 --> 02:38:45,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think it is because it's coming down to where it costs consensus.

2244
02:38:45,867 --> 02:38:46,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

2245
02:38:47,173 --> 02:38:54,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Most... Almost every single PS3, 360 game I own, I paid anywhere between $20 and $40.

2246
02:38:55,799 --> 02:39:01,963
[SPEAKER_04]: One or two, I paid retail price only because it was a game that I wanted or I got a gift card for it.

2247
02:39:02,764 --> 02:39:03,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Done and done.

2248
02:39:04,906 --> 02:39:05,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2249
02:39:06,307 --> 02:39:13,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And as for, you know, releasing the game on the Pirate Bay free like that... See, there's one thing about that.

2250
02:39:15,033 --> 02:39:16,554
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see this game...

2251
02:39:17,708 --> 02:39:32,405
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to check the comments within the first 5 or 6 comments somebody's going to be like oh this game has a hack in it don't download, don't download, don't download then you're going to go find another torrent where it's the full game and you're going to grab that

2252
02:39:34,019 --> 02:39:41,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what I understand about this particular story, though, is that the author put it up and it was downloaded so many times so fast.

2253
02:39:41,504 --> 02:39:45,447
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't figure out what's going on until you've played the game for a little bit.

2254
02:39:46,167 --> 02:39:46,487
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

2255
02:39:46,928 --> 02:39:55,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say, you know, like within an hour or so, people are going to go back to that torrent and be like, oh, don't download because... Yeah, but in an hour, it's been downloaded 5,000 times already.

2256
02:39:56,314 --> 02:39:58,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And the sad part is that that torrent is still going.

2257
02:39:58,776 --> 02:40:01,698
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're smart, you're going to stop that and just jump onto something else.

2258
02:40:01,818 --> 02:40:02,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right.

2259
02:40:02,838 --> 02:40:02,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2260
02:40:04,901 --> 02:40:07,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, anything else you wanted to share with listeners tonight?

2261
02:40:09,167 --> 02:40:10,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... No, not really.

2262
02:40:11,491 --> 02:40:11,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

2263
02:40:11,772 --> 02:40:16,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to get that off my chest and agree with y'all about this whole piracy thing, and...

2264
02:40:18,930 --> 02:40:22,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Where can I come give you a hug at an anime convention coming up soon?

2265
02:40:22,471 --> 02:40:25,412
[SPEAKER_08]: You going to any anime conventions in the next couple weeks?

2266
02:40:25,912 --> 02:40:31,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be kidnapping the entire staff, putting them in Snake's box, and dragging them to anime next in June.

2267
02:40:32,314 --> 02:40:32,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2268
02:40:33,374 --> 02:40:34,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you were coming to Fanime.

2269
02:40:34,695 --> 02:40:35,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It would give me a reason to go.

2270
02:40:36,815 --> 02:40:41,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I have my own personal reasons that I'm taking time off for this month.

2271
02:40:41,937 --> 02:40:43,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I understand.

2272
02:40:43,477 --> 02:40:45,158
[SPEAKER_08]: VXJSnakesV is going to be there, so...

2273
02:40:46,272 --> 02:40:49,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still unpacking the shoebox studio, okay?

2274
02:40:49,394 --> 02:40:49,774
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2275
02:40:49,834 --> 02:40:50,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

2276
02:40:50,454 --> 02:40:50,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

2277
02:40:50,795 --> 02:40:51,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have to pout?

2278
02:40:52,115 --> 02:40:52,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2279
02:40:52,335 --> 02:40:53,056
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll do it anyway.

2280
02:40:53,636 --> 02:40:53,936
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2281
02:40:54,416 --> 02:40:55,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, take care, Ranma.

2282
02:40:55,137 --> 02:40:55,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the call.

2283
02:40:56,157 --> 02:40:56,758
[SPEAKER_08]: You got it, bro.

2284
02:40:56,858 --> 02:40:57,098
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2285
02:40:57,138 --> 02:40:57,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

2286
02:40:57,818 --> 02:40:58,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

2287
02:40:58,739 --> 02:41:02,261
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2288
02:41:03,741 --> 02:41:07,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Also from Tigerclaw, another tweet about Zone of the Enders sequel on hold.

2289
02:41:07,543 --> 02:41:12,004
[SPEAKER_08]: The team was disbanded due to issues with the HD remake.

2290
02:41:12,424 --> 02:41:13,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Did their zone get ended?

2291
02:41:15,045 --> 02:41:15,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was.

2292
02:41:16,485 --> 02:41:16,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

2293
02:41:18,046 --> 02:41:24,228
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually from Hideo Kojima himself on Hideo blog, the radio show that he does online, his little podcast.

2294
02:41:25,009 --> 02:41:33,480
[SPEAKER_08]: The proposed sequel on Zone of the Enders was ceased, and this was because the HD collection issues were the reasons behind the stop and development.

2295
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:38,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess this doesn't mean that it can't come back later, but for right now, nope!

2296
02:41:41,031 --> 02:41:41,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Bummer.

2297
02:41:43,017 --> 02:41:47,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2298
02:41:48,843 --> 02:41:58,654
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt tweeted us something about Grant Kirkhope, who's the composer of Perfect Dark and Banjo-Kazooie, I thought you mentioned this earlier, offering their soundtracks up for Pay-As-You-Want.

2299
02:41:58,674 --> 02:42:00,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we have that Perfect Dark story earlier?

2300
02:42:01,837 --> 02:42:02,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Or did we skip it tonight?

2301
02:42:03,499 --> 02:42:04,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess I didn't show all that after all.

2302
02:42:05,180 --> 02:42:07,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to cover this, but apparently not.

2303
02:42:07,322 --> 02:42:08,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can check this out.

2304
02:42:08,463 --> 02:42:13,946
[SPEAKER_08]: GrantKirkHope.Bandcamp.com Pay as you want for Perfect Dark and Banjo-Kazooie.

2305
02:42:14,907 --> 02:42:17,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect Dark had a pretty good soundtrack, at least I know.

2306
02:42:17,589 --> 02:42:20,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play a lot of Banjo-Kazooie, but I've played a lot of Perfect Dark on 360.

2307
02:42:22,603 --> 02:42:25,825
[SPEAKER_08]: with SSJ100Matt when he had his little trolling device that worked.

2308
02:42:26,926 --> 02:42:34,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Redertainment wants to know on Twitter, is there a reason the Christian right hasn't flipped their shit about the various religious comments in Bioshock Infinite?

2309
02:42:35,730 --> 02:42:42,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the Westboro Baptist Church is getting ready to protest that Slayer guy's funeral, so that's probably what they're preoccupied with doing.

2310
02:42:42,855 --> 02:42:45,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, what a stupid idea.

2311
02:42:46,276 --> 02:42:47,357
[SPEAKER_08]: What a stupid idea.

2312
02:42:48,037 --> 02:42:50,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess I should take a step back even further.

2313
02:42:50,999 --> 02:43:15,934
[SPEAKER_08]: How unfortunate that that guy passed away and what sounds like what's really like a freak thing like you first hear that the guy dies a liver failure and he can't help but think oh yeah rock and roll lifestyle right liver failure but it turns out he may have got like a spider bite a couple years ago that led to this because he didn't get a treat like it's crazy stuff I don't know if you guys have read about it very sad stuff obviously Slayer has these hardcore fans that will carve the name of the band into their various

2314
02:43:17,878 --> 02:43:21,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Westboro Baptist Church is going to go protest this guy's funeral.

2315
02:43:24,002 --> 02:43:24,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

2316
02:43:25,403 --> 02:43:26,103
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll need it.

2317
02:43:26,244 --> 02:43:27,404
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be violent.

2318
02:43:28,505 --> 02:43:29,986
[SPEAKER_08]: But nobody's going to care.

2319
02:43:30,087 --> 02:43:31,408
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be the hilarious part.

2320
02:43:34,890 --> 02:43:36,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so screw the Westboro Baptist Church.

2321
02:43:36,531 --> 02:43:38,793
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, back to the question that was really asked by Redertainment.

2322
02:43:39,154 --> 02:43:43,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a reason the Christian right hasn't flipped their shit about the various religious comments in Bioshock Infinite?

2323
02:43:44,117 --> 02:43:45,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Bigger fish to fry right now?

2324
02:43:45,558 --> 02:43:46,399
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think, Loki?

2325
02:43:46,799 --> 02:43:47,900
[SPEAKER_08]: You've played Bioshock Infinite.

2326
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:49,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Why hasn't the religious right started complaining yet?

2327
02:43:50,402 --> 02:43:51,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they would complain about it.

2328
02:43:51,803 --> 02:43:53,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, it's fictional.

2329
02:43:53,663 --> 02:44:03,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really think it's going to be, I don't know, it's not necessarily like saying religion's bad, it's just they're extreme in the scenarios of the game.

2330
02:44:04,147 --> 02:44:06,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

2331
02:44:06,288 --> 02:44:08,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they would waste their time on that.

2332
02:44:09,049 --> 02:44:10,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're not PETA.

2333
02:44:10,249 --> 02:44:15,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess, you know, if animals are getting hurt or something like that, then maybe, you know, they'd come after them.

2334
02:44:16,158 --> 02:44:19,400
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for example, if that horse scene was still there, maybe they would come after him.

2335
02:44:21,020 --> 02:44:22,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think they care.

2336
02:44:22,681 --> 02:44:23,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they're aware of it.

2337
02:44:23,462 --> 02:44:24,642
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they'll bring it up later on.

2338
02:44:24,982 --> 02:44:31,906
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like how those gun makers or whatever get pissed off at, oh, that postal game, it's making people violent.

2339
02:44:31,946 --> 02:44:36,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, wait about 10 years and then they'll finally catch up and start complaining about it.

2340
02:44:36,088 --> 02:44:37,649
[SPEAKER_06]: That Bioshock Infinite game is like, what?

2341
02:44:37,669 --> 02:44:38,009
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

2342
02:44:38,029 --> 02:44:40,230
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just now getting around to, you know, Super Mario World.

2343
02:44:40,250 --> 02:44:43,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto 3 is so violent.

2344
02:44:45,154 --> 02:44:47,235
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I think that was it for Twitter topics tonight.

2345
02:44:47,555 --> 02:44:49,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, wait, I want to go back.

2346
02:44:49,136 --> 02:44:50,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I saw stuff earlier in the week.

2347
02:44:50,677 --> 02:44:56,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go to Loki and ask if you have any last-minute stories first.

2348
02:44:56,359 --> 02:45:01,982
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a fan-made Duke Nukem Forever mod being released for Duke Nukem 3D.

2349
02:45:02,022 --> 02:45:09,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It's based off the original footage from the 2001 E3 trailer, and you can download it for free.

2350
02:45:10,586 --> 02:45:19,190
[SPEAKER_06]: on moddb.com slash mod slash duke-nukum-forever and you just need a copy of Duke Nukem 3D.

2351
02:45:19,510 --> 02:45:20,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you play that on Steam yet?

2352
02:45:21,731 --> 02:45:22,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Multiplayer?

2353
02:45:24,132 --> 02:45:26,053
[SPEAKER_08]: You can download it.

2354
02:45:26,093 --> 02:45:26,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm waiting for that.

2355
02:45:27,013 --> 02:45:31,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I found the tweets that I was looking for that I knew had come earlier in the week.

2356
02:45:31,255 --> 02:45:33,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they're all the tweets I'm looking for.

2357
02:45:33,776 --> 02:45:35,418
[SPEAKER_08]: YYR tweeted us earlier in the week

2358
02:45:56,574 --> 02:46:17,900
[SPEAKER_08]: too soon to tell I get the comparisons with the whole fact that what didn't they also not make Madden on the Dreamcast or one of the big sports games didn't didn't make its way over there and that was kind of the beginning of the end but I think there was a lot of other stuff that came into play too I don't even think it's necessarily comparable because spec wise I don't think it's comparable at all with the next gen systems I think it's more like the current gen stuff

2359
02:46:18,380 --> 02:46:20,061
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of an in-between thing.

2360
02:46:20,641 --> 02:46:27,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's their next generation of that console, but I wouldn't compare it to the next-gen gaming systems.

2361
02:46:28,145 --> 02:46:31,827
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to be able to do what they do on those systems on that system.

2362
02:46:32,688 --> 02:46:35,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, last call for calls.

2363
02:46:35,189 --> 02:46:37,990
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2364
02:46:38,431 --> 02:46:39,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, anything else?

2365
02:46:40,492 --> 02:46:42,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega Man Unlimited looks cool.

2366
02:46:42,393 --> 02:46:43,373
[SPEAKER_06]: They got a new trailer for it.

2367
02:46:43,433 --> 02:46:44,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another fan-made game.

2368
02:46:47,595 --> 02:46:49,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it'll get shut down by Capcom.

2369
02:46:51,457 --> 02:46:53,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Earthbound 4, apparently having a fan game.

2370
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:59,484
[SPEAKER_08]: The creator said on Twitter this week, I want to say, I'm not doing it.

2371
02:46:59,604 --> 02:47:00,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Not happening.

2372
02:47:00,664 --> 02:47:01,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Very difficult to happen.

2373
02:47:03,046 --> 02:47:04,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of think you should never say never, but...

2374
02:47:06,889 --> 02:47:08,772
[SPEAKER_08]: getting more games in the Mother series.

2375
02:47:08,832 --> 02:47:09,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I should say EarthBound 4.

2376
02:47:09,933 --> 02:47:10,855
[SPEAKER_08]: It's technically Mother 4.

2377
02:47:10,955 --> 02:47:11,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

2378
02:47:11,315 --> 02:47:13,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Pyrrhus, but Mother 4.

2379
02:47:13,218 --> 02:47:14,379
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

2380
02:47:14,399 --> 02:47:17,624
[SPEAKER_06]: He could very well just put out an EarthBound game.

2381
02:47:18,245 --> 02:47:18,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha!

2382
02:47:19,226 --> 02:47:21,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say anything about EarthBound.

2383
02:47:25,399 --> 02:47:27,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well I guess no other calls tonight.

2384
02:47:28,302 --> 02:47:29,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all have been shy lately.

2385
02:47:29,443 --> 02:47:31,224
[SPEAKER_08]: We barely got any calls last week either.

2386
02:47:32,065 --> 02:47:32,686
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up with that?

2387
02:47:33,006 --> 02:47:34,748
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

2388
02:47:35,368 --> 02:47:36,029
[SPEAKER_08]: If you use it.

2389
02:47:36,750 --> 02:47:38,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'll shut down the Skype line for now.

2390
02:47:38,912 --> 02:47:45,398
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think of something later you want to send us your thoughts, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or of course it's always Twitter.

2391
02:47:45,418 --> 02:47:46,839
[SPEAKER_08]: We might stick a banana with dreadlocks on them.

2392
02:47:47,239 --> 02:47:48,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm hoping the Skype connection works.

2393
02:47:48,841 --> 02:47:49,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe something's wrong there.

2394
02:47:49,722 --> 02:47:50,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have tested it.

2395
02:47:51,603 --> 02:47:54,726
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow, we got what Rama got through, so I know at least one of it's working.

2396
02:47:55,567 --> 02:47:56,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else, Loki, you want to get out?

2397
02:47:57,989 --> 02:47:58,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

2398
02:47:58,970 --> 02:47:59,050
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

2399
02:47:59,771 --> 02:48:01,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I guess that brings us to the end of the show.

2400
02:48:03,594 --> 02:48:04,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.

2401
02:48:04,595 --> 02:48:09,199
[SPEAKER_08]: A little earlier than usual tonight, but it's only supposed to be about a three-hour show with a break included, so that's all right.

2402
02:48:10,100 --> 02:48:15,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank you guys for tuning out tonight, or tuning out, turning out tonight and tuning in.

2403
02:48:15,465 --> 02:48:15,965
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

2404
02:48:16,626 --> 02:48:17,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you can tune out.

2405
02:48:18,608 --> 02:48:19,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

2406
02:48:36,908 --> 02:48:39,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Support indie podcasting and help the community grow.

2407
02:48:40,291 --> 02:48:43,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to help our podcast grow, tell a friend or two about the show.

2408
02:48:43,954 --> 02:48:45,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave a nice review on iTunes.

2409
02:48:45,355 --> 02:48:49,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs up on Stitcher and listening time on there really helps go a long way as well.

2410
02:48:49,558 --> 02:48:50,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, really appreciate it.

2411
02:48:50,919 --> 02:48:53,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we close up shop tonight, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2412
02:48:54,522 --> 02:48:55,543
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

2413
02:48:55,623 --> 02:48:56,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Your final thought.

2414
02:49:00,146 --> 02:49:00,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Exclamation point.

2415
02:49:01,467 --> 02:49:02,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2416
02:49:03,171 --> 02:49:08,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thought is I have a lot of money to spend on Amazon soon and I don't know what to get.

2417
02:49:10,817 --> 02:49:14,720
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I should have made you buy me that IK and I spent 40 bucks on this weekend.

2418
02:49:14,740 --> 02:49:15,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that, it's an IK.

2419
02:49:15,821 --> 02:49:25,209
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, speaking of IK, what they should do is actually come out with some sort of pinball version of it, you know, use the screen as pinball and have the flippers and stuff and have a pinball game that supports it.

2420
02:49:25,289 --> 02:49:26,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're talking my language.

2421
02:49:26,550 --> 02:49:27,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

2422
02:49:27,731 --> 02:49:28,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.

2423
02:49:28,992 --> 02:49:31,013
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet there's a pinball game that supports IK though.

2424
02:49:31,614 --> 02:49:31,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

2425
02:49:31,974 --> 02:49:33,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just go with pin maim and leave it at that.

2426
02:49:33,995 --> 02:49:34,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

2427
02:49:34,475 --> 02:49:41,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised they don't have pin maim on the iPad somehow, even though the Apple Gestapo locks everything down.

2428
02:49:41,998 --> 02:49:45,999
[SPEAKER_03]: There is the whole, what is it, just called Pinball Arcade?

2429
02:49:46,019 --> 02:49:47,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I've got it on here.

2430
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:49,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Pinball Arcade, which is pretty good.

2431
02:49:49,800 --> 02:49:51,641
[SPEAKER_03]: If it had arcade support, it would be awesome.

2432
02:49:51,781 --> 02:49:52,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Be nice.

2433
02:49:53,121 --> 02:49:53,422
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2434
02:49:54,922 --> 02:49:55,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's it, guys.

2435
02:49:56,143 --> 02:49:56,563
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done.

2436
02:49:58,383 --> 02:50:00,164
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2437
02:50:00,424 --> 02:50:01,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, you guys.

2438
02:50:01,104 --> 02:50:02,524
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back to do it again next week.

2439
02:50:02,884 --> 02:50:03,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Episode 504.

2440
02:50:04,044 --> 02:50:06,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping we'll have an interview next week, so stay tuned to Twitter.

2441
02:50:06,885 --> 02:50:09,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you more about that as soon as I have that confirmed for this week.

2442
02:50:09,866 --> 02:50:11,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the meantime, have fun gaming.

2443
02:50:11,946 --> 02:50:13,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Thursday night, Forza Horizon, right?

2444
02:50:13,766 --> 02:50:15,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Forza Horizon at 8 p.m.

2445
02:50:15,827 --> 02:50:17,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Pacific Standard Time.

2446
02:50:17,167 --> 02:50:20,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mass Effect 3 at 5.30.

2447
02:50:20,888 --> 02:50:22,988
[SPEAKER_08]: All three of us broadcasting throughout the week.

2448
02:50:23,268 --> 02:50:26,669
[SPEAKER_08]: So tune into our channels and check that out.

2449
02:50:27,421 --> 02:50:28,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great week everybody.

2450
02:50:28,585 --> 02:50:31,053
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next time with more of Orange Launch Radio.

2451
02:50:31,153 --> 02:50:31,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.

2452
02:50:32,239 --> 02:50:35,241
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2453
02:50:35,881 --> 02:50:40,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
