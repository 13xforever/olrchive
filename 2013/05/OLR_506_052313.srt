00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:21,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, May 23, 2013, on this special edition of the show, we sit down to talk all about the Xbox One.

2
00:00:42,031 --> 00:01:02,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Singular sensation, every little step she takes One thrilling combination, every move that she makes One smile and suddenly nobody else will do You know you'll never be lonely with you, no clue

3
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:14,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi everybody, welcome to a special edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:22,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Live on a special May 23rd, 2013 to celebrate the Xbox One.

5
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:25,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Which of course was announced earlier this week.

6
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,231
[SPEAKER_05]: My name of course is Rob Roberts.

7
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Not joining us tonight, DarkSakura.

8
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:34,513
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were listening last week, you know she's on a family trip and we didn't want to bother her while she's on her family trip.

9
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:37,835
[SPEAKER_05]: She'll be back to lend her commentary on the next episode of OLR.

10
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:40,456
[SPEAKER_05]: But in studio tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki!

11
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:43,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel that we're celebrating this really like 12 years late.

12
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the Xbox One?

13
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so be it.

14
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:50,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so let's get down to it.

15
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:58,967
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, it's a special episode of the show, obviously, because we are not going to be here on Sunday over the Memorial Day weekend.

16
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:05,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So first off, for those of you guys here in the States that have Memorial Day weekend, we hope you have a happy and safe weekend.

17
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, let's not forget what the weekend is about.

18
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:17,796
[SPEAKER_05]: So props to everybody that currently serves in the military, who has served in the military in the past, and who has protected our freedoms.

19
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:25,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Props to you, military personnel overseas that will not be able to play the Xbox One because it is requiring a 24-hour...

20
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Once every 24 hours, call home.

21
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:30,163
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to start already, aren't you?

22
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:30,523
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

23
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:36,247
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're assuming if you've listened to this show, you're probably familiar enough with what's going on.

24
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:39,609
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to regurgitate everything and treat it like it's all new news to you.

25
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,191
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll kind of touch on some of the points.

26
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:47,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we are live Thursday night, so we have a little bit of a smaller turnout in chat than usual.

27
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,817
[SPEAKER_05]: But those of you guys that are in our chat room, please feel free to comment along as usual.

28
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:53,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Live.vognetwork.com.

29
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,943
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, I think we will take calls a little later on just depending on how late we run.

30
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:02,265
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to run too late tonight because it's a school night.

31
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:04,927
[SPEAKER_05]: But we might try to get some calls in a little later.

32
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:07,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to you guys, by the way, for staying up very late on the East Coast.

33
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,413
[SPEAKER_05]: 8.30 was the earliest we could do it with all the weekday schedules and so forth.

34
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:12,634
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

35
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:20,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so, first off, they get up on stage, they do their little announcement thing, and the name is revealed.

36
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Infinity, it's not Lube, it's not anything else we've talked.

37
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:25,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Fusion.

38
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:29,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Xbox One, which, props to them for keeping it a secret.

39
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:32,768
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, well, it's interesting.

40
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:41,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to watch the thing a little bit afterwards because I was coming home from Reno that day that it was announced.

41
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:46,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, I heard everything that was going on on the internet and I heard all the news and everything.

42
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:49,118
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted to sit down and watch the press conference for myself.

43
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:54,262
[SPEAKER_05]: But knowing the name already, when I sat down and watched it, there was a lot of clues leading up to it.

44
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:55,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Because even in like the opening...

45
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:56,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Wink, wink I don't know

46
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem with the name.

47
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:11,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

48
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:12,307
[SPEAKER_06]: You can call it whatever you want.

49
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:18,570
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as dumb as Wii.

50
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:28,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish that they would... I understand what they're trying to say with it, but at the same time, you're confusing people.

51
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:36,720
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to confuse some people because when you name a console basically after a generation previous...

52
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,193
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to confuse people.

53
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:42,578
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like people got confused with the Wii U. They thought it was the Wii.

54
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, why do I want Xbox One?

55
00:04:45,022 --> 00:04:46,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the new one, the 360.

56
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:46,364
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

57
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,671
[SPEAKER_06]: So you think there's a lot of people out there that are that slow to the pickup?

58
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:55,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that, but I think they're going to get confused.

59
00:04:55,733 --> 00:05:02,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's going to be some confusion because, I mean, obviously people thought that the Wii U was just an extension of the Wii.

60
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:09,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they're going to make that mistake, then I guess that they can make the mistake that this is a completely, you know, that it's old.

61
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:10,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

62
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:11,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of a weird name.

63
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:13,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay with the name.

64
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:16,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my favorite, but I don't absolutely hate it.

65
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:23,266
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do find it very strange that somebody didn't think of the fact that everybody today writes XB360.

66
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:26,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe they're thinking everybody's going to put XB in the number one.

67
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:30,151
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you actually write it out, XB1, you have Xbone.

68
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:31,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, perhaps.

69
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:32,172
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just...

70
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:57,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

71
00:05:57,727 --> 00:05:58,548
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of silly.

72
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:08,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Some comments in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com DungeonBuster says, I thought I saw a tweet where someone wanted to pre-order an Xbox One and the GameStop employee said they don't sell those anymore.

73
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:11,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that same tweet.

74
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:13,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

75
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:18,496
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya says, Indeed, at least with PlayStation 4, people are like, oh, it's the new one.

76
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:23,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony just kind of, you know, they took the easy way out, but it really works, right?

77
00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:25,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony's thing is works.

78
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:29,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I thought the whole idea with calling it the 360 was kind of weird in the first place.

79
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:32,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just... Well, but I got it then.

80
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:37,735
[SPEAKER_06]: We're used to it now, but it's just kind of like, I don't know.

81
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:43,516
[SPEAKER_06]: You tried going the different direction, and so now you're going back to the way you were, so you made a full 360.

82
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,997
[SPEAKER_05]: We were going back to a classic time for the Xbox.

83
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:46,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

84
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:47,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Live radio.

85
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:48,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love it.

86
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:54,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see, uh, SSJ100Matt says, I don't even think GameStop sells old Xboxes anymore.

87
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,260
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's true.

88
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, BlackWolf says, X-Bone for the Call of Duty dog.

89
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:00,903
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be the name of the dog.

90
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:05,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, BlackWolf continues on, if the name didn't kill the Wii, the name won't kill the X-Bone.

91
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:06,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree, it won't.

92
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,286
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, it's just, you know.

93
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

94
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:14,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so first things first, they get out there and they're talking.

95
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:22,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Television, you can watch The Price is Right and you can do this thing with your hands with the Kinect where you make it bigger, make it smaller.

96
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:26,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox, go to Star Wars or whatever, no, Star Trek.

97
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:33,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the very first thing they show, they show that you can sign on using your voice and it would recognize you.

98
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:37,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like what it's supposed to do on the Xbox 360, which doesn't work too well.

99
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:38,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't.

100
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to be pessimistic, but it constantly confuses me for Alan.

101
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:52,399
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't sound that much alike, and just because we both have facial hair beards doesn't mean... But I understand tech's a lot better now, so whatever.

102
00:07:52,919 --> 00:08:07,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they showed him navigating the interface using swipes of the hand and stuff, and then they have this thing where you can basically dock stuff to the side of the screen like you can on Windows 8, or I think even Windows 7 you can do that stuff.

103
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:11,988
[SPEAKER_06]: and so now you can Skype with people while you're watching a movie.

104
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:28,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I actually find that feature to be one of the more interesting features because I remember when Netflix used to be – well, it's still on 360, but it used to have that party mode where you could actually have everybody on the headset and kind of like talk during a movie.

105
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,776
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of people that were really into that and were kind of pissed when it disappeared.

106
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:35,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't even think to today we really fully understand why that disappeared.

107
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:36,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It was probably that –

108
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,519
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something we're going to get into later on.

109
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So party chat, not okay.

110
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,741
[SPEAKER_05]: But Skyping, okay.

111
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:50,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I would think maybe you can't Skype during Netflix because that might be too much bandwidth.

112
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:51,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

113
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:52,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably still can.

114
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:54,584
[SPEAKER_05]: You could probably do at least Skyping while watching a movie.

115
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:57,526
[SPEAKER_05]: But does that mean you can be synced up with the other... Did they get into that?

116
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:57,866
[SPEAKER_05]: That you...

117
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:03,951
[SPEAKER_05]: and your friend overseas can be watching the exact same thing synced up at the same moment.

118
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:04,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that.

119
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:08,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they had touched on that a little bit, that they could watch the movie together or whatever.

120
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:09,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they said that.

121
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:09,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

122
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:11,778
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing.

123
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:16,723
[SPEAKER_06]: They were showing you bring up Internet Explorer in the side and then you navigate it using your phone.

124
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:33,074
[SPEAKER_06]: or I could just go on my phone and use the browser on there instead of having to launch the app for Xbox Smart Glass and use that as... It's unnecessary.

125
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:33,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.

126
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:41,282
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I'm going to be honest, though, and this is just me and my preferences, is that I don't really watch a lot of TV.

127
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,223
[SPEAKER_05]: No, me neither.

128
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:45,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I look at features like that, I'm kind of, meh.

129
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:53,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been catching up on a few things on Netflix, but live TV, there's very little that I watch anymore.

130
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:54,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very rare.

131
00:09:55,015 --> 00:10:05,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I admit, being able to have a Skype party during RuPaul's Drag Race sounds really exciting, but, I mean, I don't know if it's something I would get a lot of use out of.

132
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:06,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do that right now.

133
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:07,423
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, that's true.

134
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:08,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just...

135
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:15,572
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a neat idea, but I don't think it's something that people are going to use a lot.

136
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:18,896
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, hey, look, Twitter and Facebook are part of Xbox.

137
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck, did anyone use that?

138
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,080
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

139
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:23,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Once.

140
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look how I'm tweeting from my Xbox.

141
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:26,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.

142
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:27,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that was it.

143
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:32,190
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 is like in a couple weeks Not a shocker there 15 games

144
00:10:55,922 --> 00:11:21,589
[SPEAKER_06]: and E3 apparently which is that's not bad how many of them are going to get delayed but well in 15 years and also on top of that 15 games not necessarily retail releases because now they're considering Xbox Live Arcade and indie games games they're just calling everything games now to make it even harder to find shit I don't know but

145
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:25,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't that disappointed they didn't show anything.

146
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,352
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, the one new property they showed from, was it Remedy or whatever?

147
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:29,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that one.

148
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:30,334
[SPEAKER_06]: It made no fucking sense.

149
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:36,597
[SPEAKER_06]: They could have just shown nothing and said, hey, new game from Remedy, and people would have been like, oh, sweet.

150
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:37,838
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Quantum Break is the name of it.

151
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Quantum Break, yeah, okay.

152
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:43,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really need, you know, I don't know.

153
00:11:43,982 --> 00:11:44,542
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked weird.

154
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:51,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was interesting that it mixed the live action with kind of a throwback to PC CD-ROM.

155
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:53,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that that's actually gameplay.

156
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:55,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's just the trailer.

157
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it was actually part of it.

158
00:11:58,311 --> 00:12:00,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I was okay.

159
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:03,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked Alan Wake a lot.

160
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was really underrated by a lot of people.

161
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:09,138
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, the weekly deal on Humble Bundle.

162
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:10,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, seriously.

163
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:13,381
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've never played Alan Wake or you don't own it, you need to get in on this Humble Bundle.

164
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:14,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Just tangent.

165
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:15,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

166
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:23,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, our chat room is lighting up, of course, as you would think for a topic that's been as hot-buttoned in the gaming community as the Xbox One.

167
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:49,131
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says the one good thing about this conference was that Microsoft actually showed the console unlike Sony who just talked about it well that seems to have been a mixed bag for them and let's talk about the look for a little bit you know the consoles look a lot of people on Twitter I'm seeing going this thing looks like a Betamax VCR it's kind of dumpy who cares yeah I I have to I'm kind of with you like I think people put way too much stock on

168
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:50,891
[SPEAKER_05]: in what the box looks like.

169
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:51,792
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your PC look like?

170
00:12:52,112 --> 00:12:52,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is that sexy?

171
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:53,712
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's a box.

172
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

173
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:57,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, some people go all out on the cases and the lights and the smoke.

174
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:57,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I understand that.

175
00:12:57,954 --> 00:12:58,854
[SPEAKER_06]: You can still do that.

176
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:01,095
[SPEAKER_06]: You can still add smoke lights and whatever.

177
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,496
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put My Little Pony stickers all over the Xbox if you want.

178
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:04,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really care.

179
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:07,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who cares if the case is all nice and rounded?

180
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:08,838
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what a rounded case means?

181
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:10,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't fucking stand it up on its end.

182
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:14,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, granted, this thing is like the size of a VCR, so you probably don't want to stack that thing on its end, but...

183
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

184
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:18,726
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it's well-ventilated, I don't care.

185
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:23,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what was exciting about the way it looks and what have you, which, you know, I'm not...

186
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:26,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that they went minimalist with it.

187
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:27,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give them that.

188
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:29,635
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a very minimalist look, and I think that's fine.

189
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:34,598
[SPEAKER_05]: If the thing is just going to sit on your shelf, you know, it doesn't need to be flashy.

190
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:44,022
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed, like, when they were making it and stuff, they're like, okay, here's the system, here's the drive, here's the chip, here's that fucking huge-ass heat sink and a giant goddamn fan on top of it.

191
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:50,005
[SPEAKER_06]: This shit will not over... Oh, and by the way, half of the console is a vent, and the other half is more vents.

192
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:52,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I don't think it's going to be a problem.

193
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:56,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and actually, the thing that excited me most that they said about it was that it's silent.

194
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

195
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:58,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Or pretty close to it, yeah.

196
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:06,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the old 360s, oh my gosh, those things are, like, I still have one of the earlier model 360s, and that thing's, it still sounds like a freight truck when you turn it on.

197
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:08,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's really loud and noticeable.

198
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:10,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So, to me, that was the most exciting part.

199
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:15,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what it looks like, just shut the hell up when I'm trying to watch a movie, right?

200
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:21,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Dungeon Buster in chat says, I'm just hoping it doesn't have the same hardware issues the 360 did early on.

201
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:21,519
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not.

202
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're talking like how many advancements in chips have there been?

203
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:33,392
[SPEAKER_06]: It's running such a, you know, like a, was it a 28, it was a 28 watt chip or 28 nanometer chip now?

204
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:35,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're really low wattage chips now.

205
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:40,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a valid concern, in my opinion, with how bad that Red Ring affected people.

206
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:45,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And not just that, but there's been a lot of tiny little stumbles along the way for Microsoft.

207
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:57,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to just pee all over them or whatever, but the reality is Xbox Live got broken into somehow and a ton of people had money stolen, including me, with their live accounts or whatever.

208
00:14:58,121 --> 00:15:01,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally had two Xboxes that Red Ring and had to be sent back.

209
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,542
[SPEAKER_05]: There was those issues.

210
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:03,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And

211
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:04,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand.

212
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:05,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony has issues.

213
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:06,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has issues too.

214
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't personally experienced any of them.

215
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:10,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Those consoles still run like rocks.

216
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:13,026
[SPEAKER_05]: My PlayStation 2 is still flawless pretty much.

217
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:16,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a valid concern.

218
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:28,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm optimistic that Microsoft's learned and so forth and I don't think we need to necessarily hold the past against them, but I understand where the concern comes from.

219
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:29,733
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while.

220
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:34,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I did like the new controller.

221
00:15:34,556 --> 00:15:35,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to get into that next.

222
00:15:35,957 --> 00:15:36,477
[SPEAKER_05]: The controller.

223
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:37,858
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think?

224
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:42,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked the idea of having actual rumble in the triggers.

225
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's kind of a neat innovation, I guess.

226
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:47,804
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like they fixed the D-pad, so that's good.

227
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:48,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God.

228
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:50,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else is pretty much the same.

229
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:56,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Battery compartments integrated inside the controller, which at first I was like, oh, sweet, built-in battery like the PlayStation 3.

230
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:02,252
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, no, it's actually it's, you know, compartment where you can put double A batteries and stuff.

231
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:03,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm a little disappointed about that.

232
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:08,174
[SPEAKER_06]: But because those batteries die so fast, I just was hoping that would be more integrated.

233
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,274
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe to keep the cost down or something.

234
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:10,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

235
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:15,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you would think that they would kind of have taken the charge idea from the PlayStation 3.

236
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's so freaking convenient with a mini USB.

237
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:18,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's I love that.

238
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:23,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that's a little disappointing, but I mean, it looks nice.

239
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:27,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a problem with, you know, how it's, you know, it's a little bit bigger now, but whatever.

240
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:29,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not that big a deal.

241
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I did not remember hearing this when I was watching the press conference.

242
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,979
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of those things that came out after the press conference is a lot did.

243
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,760
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's this whole thing?

244
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to measure your vitality?

245
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:45,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Wii Vitality Sensor, the heartbeat thing?

246
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:49,004
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the Kinect sensor can do that because it's that sensitive.

247
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:54,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it can actually see your heart rate based on your veins pulsing on your face.

248
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:55,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's that detailed now.

249
00:16:55,488 --> 00:17:00,431
[SPEAKER_05]: That's... well... The skeptic in me is wondering about that.

250
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:06,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, I thought this first Kinect was supposed to do so much and be so accurate.

251
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:07,115
[SPEAKER_06]: That Kinect sucks.

252
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:08,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm selling mine, by the way.

253
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:10,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting rid of mine right now.

254
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:12,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I'm just kind of like, I don't know.

255
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,662
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a skeptic in me that's like, I like to play video games in the dark.

256
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:18,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to see my heartbeat in the dark?

257
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:18,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It's infrared.

258
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:20,726
[SPEAKER_05]: It can still see all?

259
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:22,047
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

260
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,409
[SPEAKER_06]: It's infrared, and remember, now they have the new technology.

261
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:29,973
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a time of flight with the photons where it measures the actual distance and stuff like that.

262
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:35,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's all great and stuff, but I don't like what they're doing with it.

263
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of this tinfoil hat stuff starts making me wonder because think about it.

264
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:43,369
[SPEAKER_06]: They have this new technology now that's the time of flight stuff.

265
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:47,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to look at, you know, it's not going to just recognize you based on a picture.

266
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:50,318
[SPEAKER_06]: It's recognizing you based on like a 3D image of yourself.

267
00:17:50,858 --> 00:18:02,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and remember they patented something a while ago where it was going to be able to enforce, like, was it the public screening things of movies or whatever?

268
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:09,134
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you had a bunch of people in your house and you're watching a movie and it's like, ah, nope, sorry, too many people watching this movie at the same time type thing, you know?

269
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,235
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they would not do that.

270
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:12,316
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a patent for it.

271
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you get a patent for that?

272
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:17,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, it's not necessarily something they will implement, but...

273
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:23,165
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also I worry too that, say for example, you're sharing your login with a friend or something like that.

274
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:25,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you can log in on my account and play my game.

275
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:26,608
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to look at your face.

276
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, you don't look like that person.

277
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, not going to let you log in.

278
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:35,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm worried that they're going to try to do that, lock it down somehow.

279
00:18:35,796 --> 00:18:37,958
[SPEAKER_05]: But people change.

280
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,299
[SPEAKER_05]: What if I want to shave my beard off?

281
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,181
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to look at your beard.

282
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:45,264
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably going to look at proportions, like proportions between your eyes.

283
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:46,905
[SPEAKER_05]: What if I lose a ton of weight?

284
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:48,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

285
00:18:48,783 --> 00:18:49,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how it's going to work.

286
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:52,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Or gain a ton of weight the way I'm going.

287
00:18:52,804 --> 00:19:09,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying that I'm very worst case scenario with them because I don't, especially after the whole rumor, and I don't even know what's going on with this now because everyone's contradicting everyone else about the whole not playing used games.

288
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:11,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not necessarily.

289
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:12,549
[SPEAKER_06]: It's plays used games, okay?

290
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:16,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, all the games that you play have to be installed with hard drive.

291
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:16,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine?

292
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:17,810
[SPEAKER_05]: EA Sports Partnership Don't care

293
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they are going to be big sellers.

294
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:54,546
[SPEAKER_05]: It was interesting to see EA get out there on stage and pledge their full support to Xbox.

295
00:19:54,746 --> 00:20:04,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I said something on the last show about that, too, where they did that for Wii U and then totally just turned around and went to go to bed with their new buddy, Microsoft.

296
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:06,795
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just kind of funny the way that all played out.

297
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:11,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Which only made the news after the show more, yeah, we kind of figured that was going to happen.

298
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:11,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

299
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:37,534
[SPEAKER_06]: uh and then um Call of Duty Ghosts which I'm not so big on that series but you are so what'd you think I didn't really understand like it didn't really make any sense to me it wasn't like no I mean honestly it's like you know Black Ops 2 looked pretty awesome with all the drones and stuff and that kind of you know that was something that made me kind of excited about the game this one doesn't really other than okay stuff's kind of post-apocalyptic a little bit and there's a dog

300
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,927
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

301
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:00,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

302
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:02,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.

303
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to fucking kill the thing off.

304
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:05,947
[SPEAKER_06]: You know they're going to kill the dog off.

305
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:07,508
[SPEAKER_06]: They always kill the dog off.

306
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:11,830
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not this game, it's going to be in a game or two next.

307
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,970
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to kill that dog.

308
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Something's going to happen to that dog.

309
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:16,251
[SPEAKER_06]: That dog is not long for this world.

310
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:16,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Save the dog.

311
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag save the dog.

312
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:19,613
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

313
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:22,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

314
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:30,583
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the other big things I wanted to bring up that they talked about on stage was the Halo TV series So now it's no longer a movie we're talking about, it's a TV series we're talking about

315
00:21:52,173 --> 00:22:05,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Steven Spielberg, executive producing They had that gal on stage that used to be with CBS and all that I remember hearing that they had hired her and she was going to be working with the Xbox content delivery

316
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:10,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I was surprised we actually didn't hear more about that whole thing.

317
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:12,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not necessarily talking about the Halo TV show.

318
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:18,505
[SPEAKER_05]: In talking with some people, it seemed a little unclear at first.

319
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:21,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something that's going to be on TV?

320
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:22,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something that's going to be a Netflix Hulu thing?

321
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:32,160
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, you know, going back and watching it later when I did, it seemed pretty clear to me that they are going to launch some type of video-on-demand service.

322
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:38,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, well, I mean, they already have a video-on-demand service, but Xbox original programming or something is going to be built into that.

323
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:40,571
[SPEAKER_05]: And this Halo would obviously be a huge...

324
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,235
[SPEAKER_05]: staple in that, you know, with Steven Spielberg's name on it.

325
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:54,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially, Steven Spielberg, his, like, TV series, especially the ones that have been on, like, I think he had some on Showtime or HBO or something like that, like, The Band of Brothers, I think, was one of his, are really good.

326
00:22:54,982 --> 00:23:07,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're really good war dramas, so, I mean, assuming that it's, you know, treated nice, like, maybe not so much like that, was it the, what the fuck was that

327
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:09,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Forward Unto Dawn.

328
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:11,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Forward Unto Dawn was kind of cheesy.

329
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,932
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, assuming it's better than that, I think it could be pretty awesome.

330
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:16,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I going to watch it?

331
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:17,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.

332
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:19,834
[SPEAKER_06]: What if you have to pay for it, though?

333
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:21,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, definitely not going to watch it then.

334
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:22,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

335
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I'm not a huge fan of Halo.

336
00:23:25,516 --> 00:23:28,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I'm not going to seek out this TV show.

337
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:29,778
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't really appeal to me.

338
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,341
[SPEAKER_06]: It's neat, though, that they're, you know, they're going to talk about doing something like that.

339
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:38,222
[SPEAKER_05]: What else might they be working on, you think?

340
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:44,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe some more Xbox-centric news shows.

341
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:50,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember they used to have a bunch of their community blog stuff on there.

342
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they even had something with Major Nelson.

343
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:56,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's still there or not.

344
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:57,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe something like that.

345
00:23:59,177 --> 00:24:02,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really sure if they would have any more TV shows based on their properties.

346
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'd want to watch another...

347
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe if we do a Steven Spielberg Halo thing, we can do a Michael Bay Gears of War or something.

348
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:13,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a Michael Bay Crackdown.

349
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,063
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be awesome.

350
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:16,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something to enhance Xbox Live, possibly?

351
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:20,946
[SPEAKER_05]: This will just be, if you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber, it's a free thing for you.

352
00:24:21,346 --> 00:24:21,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

353
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:22,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

354
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:30,979
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, not to get derailed by this, but yes, there was just a 5.9 earthquake up by Susanville, which is a ways away.

355
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:33,283
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like, you know, three hours north.

356
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:34,745
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess they're feeling it.

357
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:35,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't feel it.

358
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,069
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with that?

359
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:38,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird.

360
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:40,669
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

361
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for derailing the show, Earthquake.

362
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,111
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you trying to say?

363
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:45,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.

364
00:24:45,712 --> 00:24:47,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do a show on Thursdays.

365
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:52,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so did that pretty much cover everything, at least from the press conference itself?

366
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:52,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

367
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:59,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then, of course, they said, you know, was it 15 games or something?

368
00:24:59,923 --> 00:25:03,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, which we mentioned a little bit ago, which, you know, more to come at E3.

369
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:03,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

370
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:03,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

371
00:25:06,545 --> 00:25:07,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not surprised.

372
00:25:29,156 --> 00:25:38,228
[SPEAKER_05]: and it will however be cross or backwards compatible if you will with any videos that you've bought, music that you've bought and so on.

373
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:45,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously this ties into the fact that the Xbox One is using a new chipset which the PlayStation 4 is doing the same thing.

374
00:25:46,198 --> 00:25:51,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Although on the PlayStation 4 side, you kind of go, well, use the Gaikai thing to make some magic happen.

375
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:58,445
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to offer that later on, but it's not going to be like, hey, you bought this title, now you get this game free.

376
00:25:58,525 --> 00:25:59,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to be like that.

377
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:00,647
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be nice.

378
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,109
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to happen that way, but it would be nice.

379
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:10,736
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be no backwards compatibility, which, you know, I realize that most of the, you know, PlayStation 3 wasn't backwards compatible.

380
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:13,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox 360 had limited backwards compatibility.

381
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:19,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, PlayStation 3 originally started backwards compatible, but, you know, then it slowly went away.

382
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:20,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true.

383
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:24,188
[SPEAKER_06]: It's harder to create a system with, you know, you can't...

384
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:25,168
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

385
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:44,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of with you because PlayStation 4 is in the same boat.

386
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:47,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like one does it and the other doesn't.

387
00:26:48,437 --> 00:27:00,480
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just think the thing to be concerned about is that, again, this year, at the end of the year, when these consoles are launching, you still have a lot of good stuff coming out for the current gen.

388
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And people that buy that stuff aren't going to be able to play it on the new consoles.

389
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:04,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the thing, too.

390
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:04,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

391
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:34,443
[SPEAKER_06]: you know don't think that you have to buy one of these new consoles right at launch I mean I kind of want to but I'm not really forcing myself to do that because once again any of these games that I want to play like say you know Grand Theft Auto 5 only on you know the current gen stuff you know but other stuff like Assassin's Creed 4, Battlefield 4, Call of Duty you know all that stuff is going to be also on current gen or even if you want to go further Destiny you

392
00:27:35,063 --> 00:27:36,824
[SPEAKER_06]: is going to be on current gen as well.

393
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:39,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it Watch Dogs current gen?

394
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:44,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't need to buy a new console to play these awesome games.

395
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:46,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just wait.

396
00:27:46,428 --> 00:27:55,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's be honest, the new consoles that come out that have these games on them and then also have them on the current gen, they're not going to be that drastically different.

397
00:27:55,392 --> 00:28:00,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, hell, they've shown gameplay from like the PlayStation 4 of Assassin's Creed 4.

398
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:02,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell the difference between that and the PS3 version.

399
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:04,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there's some better physics.

400
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:06,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell the difference.

401
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:07,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

402
00:28:08,337 --> 00:28:11,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's assume, you know, these games are still coming out at $60.

403
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:17,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So are they going to price the PlayStation 4 and, you know, Xbox One games the same thing?

404
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:18,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

405
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:21,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be surprised if they're the same price.

406
00:28:21,522 --> 00:28:22,843
[SPEAKER_06]: If anything, I think they're going to be like $69.

407
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:30,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I have been receiving some temporary pricing from Ubisoft.

408
00:28:31,348 --> 00:28:33,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It shows $99, but there's no way.

409
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:41,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a feeling the MSRP for games, I think that maybe hasn't been determined yet.

410
00:28:41,537 --> 00:28:42,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so either.

411
00:28:59,107 --> 00:29:23,542
[SPEAKER_06]: very slippery slope if they were to bump it up to $69.99 they're already talking about Battlefield 4 they already announced the pre-order DLC campaign that's going to be added on already and the comment is like why don't you just include that in the regular game then if you're already announcing this and it's already being worked on why is this not being included in the game well

412
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:35,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then the biggie, and this is the one that everybody's talking about, and I'm not even sure I can make sense of what the hell is happening with this news.

413
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:50,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft's not giving a clear answer on it, and they pretty much have said that they won't until E3, and I think this whole thing started with a post, and surprise that this came from Kotaku that started a crazy wave over the internet.

414
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:51,242
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't Kotaku.

415
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:56,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm thinking of that interview that they had with Phil Harrison, right?

416
00:29:56,848 --> 00:30:05,797
[SPEAKER_06]: It started with Wired Magazine got the exclusive interview or whatever with Microsoft about their Xbox One console.

417
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:10,482
[SPEAKER_06]: They were the first to have everything, and then it kind of spun off from their people asking follow-up questions about that.

418
00:30:10,782 --> 00:30:10,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

419
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:22,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So they first, it talked about how the console will play used games, but will require you to pay a fee in order to use that disc a second time.

420
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,391
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, it just...

421
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:38,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, first off, I don't know even if this is going to happen because they keep going back on it and, you know, the Xbox support Twitter saying no, it's completely wrong.

422
00:30:38,188 --> 00:30:39,789
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to get them to remove that story.

423
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:40,830
[SPEAKER_06]: It's completely inaccurate.

424
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, quote from the Xbox support account.

425
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:48,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand your concerns, but can confirm that any information for fees for used games is incorrect.

426
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:58,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if in a lot of these people asking the same question to these guys, they're phrasing it in a very careful way.

427
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:06,009
[SPEAKER_06]: When they're asking about, can I go to my friend's house and play my copy of a game?

428
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:09,570
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, yes, you can go to your friend's house and play your copy of the game.

429
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,271
[SPEAKER_06]: You can install it to their drive, but you have to log into your account to do that.

430
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:15,852
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't just loan them the game.

431
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:23,396
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's happening right now is basically it sounds like every game is going to have a code that comes with it, kind of like the online pass.

432
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:28,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically that code is going to lock that game to your system.

433
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:34,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So you install it, you give them the authentication code, and then you can play the game without the disc anymore.

434
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,103
[SPEAKER_06]: The disc is basically, you don't need it.

435
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:41,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what they haven't explained is what happens when you give that disc to your friend and they don't have a code.

436
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:45,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, originally they said, okay, you're going to have to pay full price.

437
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:51,680
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is coming from an interview from higher ups saying this, that you're going to have to pay the full price of the game to play it on your system.

438
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I took that as, you're going to have to pay the full price to play that game on your system without a disc.

439
00:31:56,445 --> 00:32:02,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand why they can't do it, you know, okay, you can play the game off the disc.

440
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:10,131
[SPEAKER_06]: But I understand why they're doing that is because, you know, I could buy it, load it on my system, play without a disc, give it to my friend, he plays with the disc, you get two games for the price.

441
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:10,832
[SPEAKER_06]: One, basically.

442
00:32:10,872 --> 00:32:11,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So they can't do it that way.

443
00:32:11,812 --> 00:32:16,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I'm hearing something about the installation is being done because Blu-ray drives are too slow.

444
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes and no.

445
00:32:19,402 --> 00:32:23,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yes, I understand that they're... But that's fine.

446
00:32:23,123 --> 00:32:24,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Forced installation is fine.

447
00:32:24,604 --> 00:32:26,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Then why do we need the one-time use code?

448
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,485
[SPEAKER_06]: That's DRM.

449
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:30,185
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it is.

450
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:30,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It's DRM.

451
00:32:30,885 --> 00:32:36,387
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not... I understand the drive's slow and that you can force that, but you know what?

452
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:37,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

453
00:32:37,947 --> 00:32:39,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, I have my Xbox 360.

454
00:32:39,608 --> 00:32:42,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I install games to the hard drive, and the disk's in the drive.

455
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,952
[SPEAKER_06]: It reads the disk for a little bit to authenticate that you have the disk, and it runs it off the hard drive.

456
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't we do it the same way?

457
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:50,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand why we can't do it the same way.

458
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:51,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they want DRM.

459
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:53,877
[SPEAKER_06]: They want the DRM in there because there's...

460
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:55,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

461
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:18,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to put a code in now that, you know, play my game.

462
00:33:18,855 --> 00:33:22,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And see what they haven't explained right now is that how are you going to revoke that?

463
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,861
[SPEAKER_06]: They said they're supporting used games, okay?

464
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:29,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's pretend that this is actually a one-time used code like it is with the online passes.

465
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:37,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Then when I sell it to GameStop, as this current scenario is right, as they're explaining right now, granted this is going to change in a drop of a dime,

466
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:40,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I sell this back to GameStop.

467
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are they going to buy it from me first off?

468
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:45,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if anybody takes that game and tries to install it, it's going to ask them for $60.

469
00:33:45,978 --> 00:33:53,142
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're essentially killing used games even though you can pass it off to a friend and they can install it for the full price.

470
00:33:53,682 --> 00:33:59,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's got to be something in the way of where you can revoke your license or whatever on that.

471
00:34:00,225 --> 00:34:10,588
[SPEAKER_06]: But once again, that's going to require that code because unless there's a code somehow on that disk, and I don't know how that would even be accomplished because I don't even know.

472
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:17,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't even make sense how that would even be accomplished unless there's like some RFID tag or something like that, which can be faked.

473
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,471
[SPEAKER_06]: You could fake that.

474
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:24,297
[SPEAKER_06]: If it is tied to that code, and I lose that code, then how... Is that disk useless now?

475
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:26,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't use that disk because I don't have the code to install it?

476
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand how it's going to work.

477
00:34:28,342 --> 00:34:35,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go back to something that was said through an official channel, and this was on majornelson.com, and he's kind of the mouthpiece for Microsoft.

478
00:34:35,810 --> 00:35:00,232
[SPEAKER_05]: and during all this you know craziness about the used games he released a statement on his blog that says quote we know there is some confusion around used games on Xbox One and wanted to provide a bit of clarification on exactly what we've confirmed today while there have been many potential scenarios discussed today we have only confirmed that we designed Xbox One to enable our customers to trade in and resell games at retail

479
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:03,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So you will be able to use GameStop somehow in this.

480
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:08,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, I understand that they have it so that you can trade in your games and resell it.

481
00:35:08,755 --> 00:35:10,376
[SPEAKER_06]: But what if it's worthless?

482
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:14,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, hell, you can, you know, if it's... Yeah, but I don't think you say that if it's worthless.

483
00:35:14,517 --> 00:35:15,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's something there.

484
00:35:15,837 --> 00:35:19,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so there's something there, but it doesn't make any sense that it has to be this complicated.

485
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:20,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it as easily...

486
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:23,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't it be the same as it is now?

487
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand why they have to do that.

488
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:25,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know.

489
00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:27,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because they got pressured by EA to do this.

490
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:31,010
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you think they got their silly little EA partnership?

491
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's because they fucking implemented this shit.

492
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:34,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, though.

493
00:35:34,534 --> 00:35:35,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me play Devil's Avenue for a minute.

494
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:36,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Now...

495
00:35:36,856 --> 00:35:42,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim Tripp's in our chat and says, there are a lot of other really good reasons to play off a hard drive besides DRM.

496
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing I can think of, you know, you might... Hold on, hold on.

497
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:56,550
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I can think of is that on the 360, there have been problems when some people use the disk, some people install to the drive, and sometimes one is too slow, one is too fast.

498
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,832
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there were problems when people were installing certain games and so forth.

499
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:02,754
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is kind of one way to level that playing field.

500
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:02,954
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

501
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:05,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem with installing to the hard drive.

502
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:06,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a great idea.

503
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:09,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I install all my games to the hard drive anyways because, yes, that drive is loud.

504
00:36:10,058 --> 00:36:10,719
[SPEAKER_06]: It's slow.

505
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,639
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

506
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem with that.

507
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a problem with the one-time use code.

508
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:15,501
[SPEAKER_06]: That is my problem right there.

509
00:36:15,622 --> 00:36:16,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but then how –

510
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:17,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I can understand.

511
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:18,643
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you stop?

512
00:36:19,063 --> 00:36:20,924
[SPEAKER_05]: You install it, and then I take it to my friends.

513
00:36:20,984 --> 00:36:21,565
[SPEAKER_05]: They install it.

514
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:24,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It requires a disk in the drive, just like it is now.

515
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:26,067
[SPEAKER_06]: It requires a disk in the drive.

516
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:26,587
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

517
00:36:26,787 --> 00:36:29,989
[SPEAKER_06]: It just spins it, the check that's there, and that's it.

518
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:32,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand why it has to be any more complicated than that.

519
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,012
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making it complicated because they're fucking treating it.

520
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:37,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you just say that somebody's worked around that system on 360?

521
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:41,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they've worked around it and they patched it.

522
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:41,955
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

523
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:43,557
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different story now.

524
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:44,477
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking a new console.

525
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:47,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And not everybody is doing that.

526
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:50,362
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about people that are pirating games.

527
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:52,564
[SPEAKER_06]: A small minority are doing this.

528
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:55,447
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're treating everybody like a pirate.

529
00:36:56,107 --> 00:37:04,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll agree with you to the extent that if a small minority figured out a way to work the system now, that same small minority is going to figure out a way to work the system then.

530
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:08,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll meet you to that point.

531
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read the rest of Major Nelson's statement.

532
00:37:13,055 --> 00:37:14,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Beyond that, we have not confirmed any specific scenarios.

533
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:19,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, another piece of clarification around playing games at a friend's house.

534
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:24,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Should you choose to play your game at your friend's house, there is no fee to play that game.

535
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:26,682
[SPEAKER_05]: while you are signed into your profile.

536
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:29,104
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the end of the statement.

537
00:37:29,604 --> 00:37:31,325
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot there that's unsaid.

538
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:33,687
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like you read the inverse of that.

539
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:41,932
[SPEAKER_06]: They're treating all games as a digital download, but whether you're digitally downloading it off the disc or downloading it off the internet.

540
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:52,119
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem with that is I like that you want to treat it like this, and this is very idealistic of Microsoft to think this way, but that's not how the fucking world works.

541
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:53,640
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

542
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:17,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people like to have that equity where they know they can sell it later.

543
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:23,745
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of people that buy games full price and then sell them for whatever nickels and dimes they can get to get some of their money back when they beat it.

544
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:24,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

545
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:25,386
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's my thing.

546
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:30,387
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very idealistic of them to think that they can pull that off right now.

547
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:30,968
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

548
00:38:31,288 --> 00:38:39,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you should wait another decade or so where the infrastructure is in place to where that actually is a thing where you can download games and it's very effortlessly.

549
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:40,111
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

550
00:38:41,511 --> 00:38:42,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, it's not there.

551
00:38:43,252 --> 00:38:46,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't think that you can pull this off.

552
00:38:46,515 --> 00:38:49,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, you can't do this.

553
00:38:50,138 --> 00:38:51,799
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to try to do this, but you know what?

554
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:54,021
[SPEAKER_06]: If not everyone is on board, it's not going to work.

555
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:58,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And if PlayStation 4 is on, and you better believe, PlayStation 4 is probably thinking the same thing.

556
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:03,207
[SPEAKER_06]: We may have made this deal before, but we're not sure if we're going to do this.

557
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:15,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I was reading this in chat earlier, and I apologize, I don't remember the specific names of the people saying this, but some people were talking about PlayStation 4, and could Sony actually have this exact same system in place, but they're letting Microsoft take the heat for it?

558
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:18,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong.

559
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that both companies met together and agreed on something.

560
00:39:23,234 --> 00:39:26,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think EA started it, tinfoil hat, if you will.

561
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:34,024
[SPEAKER_06]: EA wouldn't just drop it if one company was doing it.

562
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:39,609
[SPEAKER_06]: They would say, okay, yeah, we're not doing it on the 360 or the Xbox, but we're going to do it on the PlayStation 4.

563
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so everybody's on board with this because that's the only way it's going to work.

564
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:48,016
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not counting Nintendo because Nintendo doesn't, it's just, you know, whatever.

565
00:39:48,176 --> 00:39:49,517
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't even matter.

566
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,440
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so small, it's, you know, it's no big deal to them.

567
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're all on board with this.

568
00:39:55,042 --> 00:40:00,126
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I could see one of them or both of them backing out of it because of the backlash of it.

569
00:40:01,307 --> 00:40:09,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to go here now, and a lot of people in our chat room, starting with Slidekick, are going here too, is about, well, isn't this interesting now?

570
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:18,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say your little tinfoil hat locked boardroom scenario, EA sat Sony and Microsoft down to mutually agree on this or whatever.

571
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:21,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Who has EA recently apparently turned their back on?

572
00:40:21,675 --> 00:40:22,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo.

573
00:40:22,695 --> 00:40:27,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't this put the Wii U in this really interesting situation now where none of this fuckery exists there?

574
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:48,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And despite all this talk about, you know, where the Wii U is in this horrible place and da-da-da-da-da Suddenly, the Wii U has got the system we all want To be able to trade games and rent games No, here's the thing though, here's the thing It's like, you don't have to do any of this

575
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

576
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:52,522
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to buy any systems.

577
00:40:52,682 --> 00:40:54,684
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to pick one of the three consoles.

578
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:57,726
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, make your choice, you know, and that's it.

579
00:40:58,006 --> 00:40:59,027
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got tons of choices.

580
00:40:59,047 --> 00:40:59,728
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go PC.

581
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:05,592
[SPEAKER_06]: You can keep the consoles you have now because I'll bet you they're going to keep supporting those consoles if no one's buying the new ones.

582
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:10,757
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, like I said, if you want to buy the Wii U, cool, buy the Wii U. But I don't think that all of a sudden...

583
00:41:11,517 --> 00:41:25,441
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, why would I buy a console that generates pretty much the same type of graphics as... There's nothing really to gain for me from the Wii U. But I'm just saying that you don't have to buy these new consoles.

584
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:25,941
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing.

585
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:27,822
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I don't have to put up with this bullshit.

586
00:41:27,842 --> 00:41:30,682
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to go ahead and try to implement all this stuff where I can't sell games?

587
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:31,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know what?

588
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:33,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't sell games on Steam either, but here's the thing.

589
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:35,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Steam drops the price of their games...

590
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:37,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Very frequently.

591
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:39,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get some really good deals.

592
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:44,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And I buy games that if on console, you know, I probably wouldn't be picking up those games.

593
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:57,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I can honestly say, you know, I get the Steam comparison and there's this little meme that's on Twitter that I saw somewhere that says, you know, Xbox One announces that new games are tied to one account.

594
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:58,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Internet gets crazy.

595
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Steam games are tied to one account.

596
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody loves Valve.

597
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:02,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart, you type of thing.

598
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:06,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, although I get the point there, I'm thinking back myself personally.

599
00:42:07,064 --> 00:42:12,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never bought a game on Steam for $60 that was digital distribution only.

600
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:16,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I have bought PC games where I had the little disc in my hand for $60.

601
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:21,914
[SPEAKER_05]: World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, whatever.

602
00:42:22,435 --> 00:42:28,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I've bought PC games that way, but I've never done digital distribution on a game that wasn't on a cheap sale.

603
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've talked about this on an older OLR.

604
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I said there's going to be... Again, this is all probably hysteria anyway.

605
00:42:34,823 --> 00:42:36,504
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't really fucking know what's happening.

606
00:42:37,224 --> 00:43:02,289
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's gotta be some give here if you're gonna tell people that their games are going to lose equity and you're not gonna have that same resale value then you need to make the price of a new game cheaper something's gotta give that's why people love Steam because Steam makes games a heck of a lot cheaper yeah exactly like I bought was it I've just bought a Sonic bundle with you know like 12 games in it for 20 bucks and

607
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:05,690
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's that cheap impulse buy.

608
00:43:06,071 --> 00:43:11,894
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't see Microsoft and, you know, Sony marking down their games by like 60% or something.

609
00:43:12,354 --> 00:43:13,534
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not going to happen.

610
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,837
[SPEAKER_06]: So what makes you think it's going to all of a sudden start happening when they lock everything?

611
00:43:17,857 --> 00:43:24,320
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, let's say we live in this perfect world now where we have the bandwidth to download these games digitally and they decide, hey, you know what?

612
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,320
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the way we're going to go.

613
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,401
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do everything digital.

614
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:29,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really think they're going to have the same type of sales as Steam does?

615
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:30,283
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

616
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:30,343
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

617
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:31,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course not.

618
00:43:31,384 --> 00:43:40,011
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like how on the PlayStation Network, how you can get PlayStation portable games that are more expensive on the digital store than they are at retail.

619
00:43:41,473 --> 00:43:50,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Osfer in chat says, I like the point someone made earlier that while we should be used to tied accounts on PC, that was something we didn't have to deal with for consoles, and it was nice.

620
00:43:52,683 --> 00:44:01,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Captain Spike says, not to prove EA right about Steam devaluing games, but aside the very rare new release once or twice a year, I don't buy anything on Steam that's more than like $20.

621
00:44:01,991 --> 00:44:05,975
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you hear those companies complaining?

622
00:44:06,195 --> 00:44:11,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Those companies have already made back their money a lot of times on these games, and now they're just dropping prices.

623
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,881
[SPEAKER_06]: It's extra sales for them.

624
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:14,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're not printing discs.

625
00:44:14,763 --> 00:44:17,225
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a digital copy.

626
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:19,367
[SPEAKER_06]: It costs nothing for them to manufacture that.

627
00:44:20,468 --> 00:44:23,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get to one more comment from Major Nelson's blog.

628
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:30,658
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a chat with Yahoo, which, God, Yahoo is everywhere in the news all of a sudden, with the whole Tumblr and everything else they've been buying.

629
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:37,965
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, Major Nelson was on Yahoo, and the very first question thrown at him in the Yahoo chat is about used games.

630
00:44:38,786 --> 00:44:43,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Larry, could you please provide some more clarity as to how users will be able to play used games on Xbox One?

631
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:44,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the response.

632
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:50,052
[SPEAKER_05]: We are still months away from the launch of Xbox One, and policy decisions are still being finalized.

633
00:44:50,472 --> 00:44:58,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that being said, do we need to just sit down and fucking wait for E3 for more information to come out on this?

634
00:44:59,257 --> 00:45:01,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the internet going too crazy with this shit?

635
00:45:02,058 --> 00:45:02,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

636
00:45:18,954 --> 00:45:19,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

637
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:48,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you reminded me of one big thing they talked about at the press conference that we didn't talk about earlier, and that's the Azure Cloud, or Blue Cloud, Windows Blue, haha.

638
00:45:48,501 --> 00:45:49,922
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have the cloud, right?

639
00:45:50,182 --> 00:45:54,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're talking about that they can do processing on the cloud, and that's something you can do in games.

640
00:45:54,844 --> 00:45:57,965
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it, something like 300,000 servers functioning, da-da-da?

641
00:45:58,585 --> 00:46:02,228
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course this makes people think in their mind, isn't this what SimCity?

642
00:46:02,788 --> 00:46:08,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So Xbox One is going to have, you could put SimCity on Xbox One.

643
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:10,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're just saying it's something that they can implement.

644
00:46:12,454 --> 00:46:13,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody can do that.

645
00:46:13,495 --> 00:46:15,096
[SPEAKER_06]: They can have an online only game.

646
00:46:15,977 --> 00:46:18,458
[SPEAKER_06]: That's up to the decision to the developer and the publisher.

647
00:46:18,578 --> 00:46:22,781
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, cool that they're offering this for developers to use if they need to.

648
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:22,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

649
00:46:24,062 --> 00:46:25,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine with that because you know what?

650
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:30,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll figure out which games those are and I just won't play them if that's an issue for me.

651
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:38,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just don't... Would this be a deal breaker for you?

652
00:46:38,694 --> 00:46:38,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

653
00:46:39,054 --> 00:46:44,238
[SPEAKER_05]: If they implement this not to your satisfaction, are you writing off this console completely?

654
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:52,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if it has Killer Instinct, Grand Theft Auto 6, the games that you really want to have?

655
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:52,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

656
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,428
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to mess with this bullshit.

657
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:58,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have to mess with this bullshit on PC.

658
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:59,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll build a new PC.

659
00:47:02,372 --> 00:47:05,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I will play the backlog of games I'm going to have.

660
00:47:05,374 --> 00:47:15,420
[SPEAKER_06]: And besides Grand Theft Auto 5, who knows, whenever Grand Theft Auto 6 comes out four or five years from now, I'm sure all this stuff will be ironed out already.

661
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,583
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's talk about one other thing that had the internet a bit in a tizzy, and that's the always online thing.

662
00:47:20,623 --> 00:47:21,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of things that...

663
00:47:22,344 --> 00:47:25,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Got the internet into a lot of rabble rabble talking, whatever, right?

664
00:47:26,106 --> 00:47:27,326
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy got fired.

665
00:47:27,346 --> 00:47:29,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I love how all these rumors are like, oh, there's no way.

666
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:34,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I was even saying, there's no fucking way that they'd pull this shit off because they can't.

667
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:39,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're going to hurt themselves if Sony's not on board with this stuff.

668
00:47:39,391 --> 00:47:43,272
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a nutshell, it appears, and I don't think we really have a clear answer.

669
00:47:43,852 --> 00:47:45,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they've really clarified this.

670
00:47:45,353 --> 00:47:49,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this, again, came from one of them Kotaku interviews that turned into a headline.

671
00:47:50,615 --> 00:48:13,872
[SPEAKER_05]: but I what I'm understanding is that you will not need to be constantly connected to the internet but approximately once every 24 hours your Xbox needs to touch base with home to update the programming guide information and all that but it might need again we don't know they haven't really said it might impact the game transaction especially if you are having to

672
00:48:14,973 --> 00:48:17,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Lock and unlock codes and so forth.

673
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:24,940
[SPEAKER_05]: That may be a part of this too, where you need to be connected once every 24 hours or your one may not let you do what you want to do.

674
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,401
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's what I was thinking.

675
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:28,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's what I was hoping that they would do.

676
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:32,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Ideally is that you would have that one-time use code.

677
00:48:33,046 --> 00:48:38,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you use that, then yes, you have to authenticate with a server so that you can run that game without a disk.

678
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:43,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you install it, you'd have to authenticate it for the installation and it's tied to your account.

679
00:48:43,814 --> 00:48:44,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So be it.

680
00:48:44,274 --> 00:48:46,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like if you downloaded an Xbox Live arcade game.

681
00:48:48,378 --> 00:48:54,102
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you don't have that or if you can't authenticate it, you'd still be able to play the game as long as the disc is in the drive.

682
00:48:54,202 --> 00:48:56,204
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my hope because that makes sense to me.

683
00:48:56,344 --> 00:48:58,005
[SPEAKER_06]: It's simple, easy, we can do that.

684
00:48:58,786 --> 00:49:00,007
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're not going to have it that way.

685
00:49:00,027 --> 00:49:02,648
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they want, once again, they're treating you like a pirate.

686
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:09,430
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to make sure that that shit is not somehow pirated onto your system and they're going to check it once every 24 hours.

687
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't buy it's to update their fucking channel guide.

688
00:49:12,511 --> 00:49:13,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know what?

689
00:49:13,212 --> 00:49:16,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to be using it for TV because as of right now, I can't.

690
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:17,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a cable box.

691
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:24,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a TV that a coax cable goes inside and I use my tuner to use the open QAM channels.

692
00:49:25,157 --> 00:49:28,241
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't do that.

693
00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:30,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but you can actually.

694
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:32,405
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to buy a separate piece of hardware.

695
00:49:32,445 --> 00:49:33,306
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck them for that.

696
00:49:33,706 --> 00:49:33,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

697
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:46,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, but I'm going to cut a little slack here because it's not like we didn't change at some point from the coaxial plug-in to the RCA switches, right?

698
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:49,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, what, Atari 2600, you had to have coaxial.

699
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:59,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you get into Nintendo NES, you can do that with an RF switch, or you can do the red-yellow plugs, red-yellow-white plugs, and then that turns into composite years later.

700
00:49:59,419 --> 00:50:00,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're at HDMI.

701
00:50:01,821 --> 00:50:26,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't exactly fault the logical steps we're taking in input clarity I don't have anything to output HDMI into my console That's what I'm saying And yes, I do think it's a fucking ridiculous thing that they have where the console does not have component support The PlayStation 4 does, so I don't know why they can't do it here

702
00:50:27,677 --> 00:50:29,520
[SPEAKER_05]: VOG cough in our chat room.

703
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:30,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn your head and VOG cough.

704
00:50:31,484 --> 00:50:36,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Says, Sky, what's the difference between Xbox One's every 24-hour authentication and Steam's authentication?

705
00:50:38,717 --> 00:50:40,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair question, but...

706
00:50:41,764 --> 00:50:49,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess one thing I think of, too, is that, okay, well, in order to use Steam in the first place, you had to be on the internet.

707
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:57,713
[SPEAKER_05]: So, logically, you have an internet connection because you got Steam, whereas I don't necessarily need to be on the internet to pick up an Xbox One game.

708
00:50:57,753 --> 00:50:59,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I can walk into a GameStop and get that.

709
00:51:00,334 --> 00:51:22,829
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know again the the thing people most commonly cite military bases don't always have an internet connection a lot of them do though but like one of my friends is on the military and he doesn't post on Facebook all day long but but uh you know granted others don't necessarily have that connection so but they can still get the PC games mailed to them and so forth but that wasn't through Steam

710
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:41,737
[SPEAKER_05]: so I mean that's I guess the key difference is that in order to get that Steam game in the first place you had to be on the internet so clearly you have an internet connection whereas with Xbox One if that's the only way to do it to play the game it is a little bit different than necessarily PC gaming so

711
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:46,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly, I don't know, I haven't really had a problem with internet.

712
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:59,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been places without internet at my work or whatever and still play my Steam games just fine, but I do connect, I have internet at home and stuff, so I haven't really been without internet for a long span of time.

713
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:05,273
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't really know how Steam treats that, so I can't really say.

714
00:52:05,753 --> 00:52:07,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know that they have an offline mode.

715
00:52:08,255 --> 00:52:10,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm not really sure how that works either.

716
00:52:10,216 --> 00:52:12,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, some people in chat are talking about offline mode right now.

717
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:13,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works fine.

718
00:52:16,195 --> 00:52:16,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

719
00:52:16,715 --> 00:52:20,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I would trust... It just doesn't seem that bad on Steam.

720
00:52:21,018 --> 00:52:22,680
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, everything's digital on Steam.

721
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is digital.

722
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:28,824
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, I understand that they're using the excuse that, okay, you're just digitally downloading off a disc.

723
00:52:29,484 --> 00:52:31,005
[SPEAKER_06]: However you want to fucking word that.

724
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:32,286
[SPEAKER_06]: That's ridiculous.

725
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:36,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know.

726
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:47,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't like the fact that game companies still treat everybody as a licensed user instead of you own this like I own a car.

727
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:54,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but judging from the internet reaction, some people are basing their decision on this console on that.

728
00:52:55,098 --> 00:52:55,598
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

729
00:52:55,998 --> 00:53:01,001
[SPEAKER_05]: If this used thing pans out to be true, there's a lot of people on the internet that are...

730
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:09,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right now, like I said... And you might say, angry fanboys, da-da-da-da-da, but, you know, every one of those comments is coming from a potential buyer.

731
00:53:09,804 --> 00:53:13,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't made any firm decisions about any console yet, so, you know, whatever.

732
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:19,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think anybody should until at least E3, because, to be fair, again, we don't know the answers to this, necessarily.

733
00:53:19,848 --> 00:53:21,508
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having to read between the lines on a lot of this.

734
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:23,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that... Microsoft needs to make it crystal clear.

735
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:24,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that... So does Sony.

736
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:28,431
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to see what games are coming, because... I don't know.

737
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:30,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza 5's kind of cool, but...

738
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:32,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I need a console for that?

739
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:33,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

740
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,802
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a hard one to say no to, right?

741
00:54:01,302 --> 00:54:01,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

742
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:05,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, no, not for me, because I never was a fan of Killer Instinct.

743
00:54:06,024 --> 00:54:06,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, get out.

744
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:07,445
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

745
00:54:07,465 --> 00:54:20,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, Crackdown, Crackdown 3, which there is a rumor that that's going to be one of the games, because they had the little orb icon on their dashboard during the presentation.

746
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I may have to get in on that.

747
00:54:25,452 --> 00:54:30,475
[SPEAKER_05]: One other thing I want to mention about the hardware and the always online in this is the whole Kinect.

748
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:35,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Kinect apparently has to be plugged in.

749
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,698
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have that.

750
00:54:36,758 --> 00:54:40,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I don't know if this is coming directly from Microsoft or where this came from.

751
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know where we ended up at this conclusion?

752
00:54:43,202 --> 00:54:46,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was one of the after interview things.

753
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:46,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

754
00:54:47,564 --> 00:55:15,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand why it has to be because they have it's once again it's just like games being installed to the hard drive they have to assume that you have it so they can use it they can't just you know program it so that you don't have it although I mean it would be nice to assume that you have it and then you know if the game doesn't use it maybe just not well actually because you're still gonna have to use it for the interface it'd be cool if you turn that off and if a game needs it it'd be like a controller's unplugged or something

755
00:55:16,005 --> 00:55:37,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing, and this is causing a lot of people, like, somebody on Twitter was saying that they had heard Glenn Beck, which I'm so sorry that you had to hear that, but maybe it was people that were listening to Glenn Beck or whatever, that apparently they were talking about this on a show the other day, about the conspiracy theories about how the Connect is how the government is going to spy on us in our homes, and all this.

756
00:55:37,765 --> 00:55:38,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, and...

757
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was totally the plot of an episode of Scandal.

758
00:55:41,527 --> 00:55:46,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, but this is going to once again out me that I still read Kotaku occasionally.

759
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:47,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

760
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:49,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hard habit to break.

761
00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:52,530
[SPEAKER_06]: You like trash.

762
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Just admit it.

763
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:54,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen.

764
00:55:55,991 --> 00:56:15,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I fully understand Sometimes you find cans in the garbage so you can go recycle It's not that I'm entertained by what they're posting because honestly I hold Polygon to the same level of garbage in their postings so I like to have the full picture and I read everything and even if that means reading the same story like five times

765
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:28,543
[SPEAKER_06]: But they actually wanted their posts on there where they were trying to get people to send messages to Fox News because they wanted to run the whole campaign of the Xbox One doesn't let our troops play games.

766
00:56:29,464 --> 00:56:30,344
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to get on that.

767
00:56:30,364 --> 00:56:31,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fuck that.

768
00:56:31,484 --> 00:56:42,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, you... Okay, so when Fox News decides to go on something, some crazy-ass tangent that Mass Effect has crazy lesbian sex and is corrupting our kids or whatever...

769
00:56:42,426 --> 00:56:46,716
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you want to tear them down, but then, oh, now it's suddenly convenient.

770
00:56:46,756 --> 00:56:50,745
[SPEAKER_05]: We might need them to be a mouthpiece to, you know, get on the gaming companies.

771
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:52,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, go.

772
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:56,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a new hobby, for fuck's sake.

773
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:00,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some questions in chat.

774
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:01,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Polygon is garbage?

775
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:02,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

776
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:03,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

777
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:05,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't agree, by the way.

778
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:06,754
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Loki's opinion, not mine.

779
00:57:06,774 --> 00:57:07,475
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my opinion.

780
00:57:07,575 --> 00:57:08,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

781
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me change that review five more times.

782
00:57:11,097 --> 00:57:12,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it isn't trash anymore.

783
00:57:12,698 --> 00:57:13,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great.

784
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:15,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nope, trash again.

785
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, it's great.

786
00:57:17,121 --> 00:57:18,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's not what this episode's about.

787
00:57:18,862 --> 00:57:21,123
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here's what I wanted to say about the always-on Kinect.

788
00:57:21,263 --> 00:57:28,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So my assumption is one of the reasons it needs to do that is because, you know, to walk into your house and say, like, Xbox, turn on, and all this.

789
00:57:28,088 --> 00:57:34,051
[SPEAKER_05]: But now after what you said about the whole it wants to see how many people are in the room to watch a movie, like, I kind of can't help but go, God, that's weird.

790
00:57:34,832 --> 00:57:36,332
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you going to stop that?

791
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:37,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you blocking it?

792
00:57:37,093 --> 00:57:38,114
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to say something's blocking this.

793
00:57:38,134 --> 00:57:38,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

794
00:57:39,074 --> 00:57:42,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I just turn my Kinect around to face the wall and cover the mic?

795
00:57:42,696 --> 00:57:43,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it'll be like, where are you?

796
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:48,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Then if the system does... I'm going to be honest.

797
00:57:48,645 --> 00:57:50,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to be perfectly honest.

798
00:57:50,806 --> 00:57:56,489
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's how the system's going to work, that almost concerns me more than the used game HUBBLU thing.

799
00:57:57,037 --> 00:58:06,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, sometimes, guys, I like to, when I get home, take off my pants, then sit down in the couch and play some video games.

800
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,561
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't necessarily need a camera on me showing what I look like down there in the corner or whatever when I'm doing that.

801
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:13,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you get a quick Skype call.

802
00:58:14,482 --> 00:58:18,623
[SPEAKER_05]: What if I accidentally leave Skype open or, you know, heaven forbid, the voice command, you know?

803
00:58:19,623 --> 00:58:21,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox, broadcast live on Twitch.

804
00:58:22,247 --> 00:58:23,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what happens.

805
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want that.

806
00:58:26,172 --> 00:58:27,194
[SPEAKER_05]: That's stupid, bitch.

807
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:28,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Launching Twitch.

808
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, something like that.

809
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, right?

810
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:34,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I...

811
00:58:35,248 --> 00:58:42,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize they're talking about these privacy settings and so forth, but again, you're asking me to just fucking trust you.

812
00:58:42,491 --> 00:58:50,434
[SPEAKER_06]: One cool thing we forgot to mention is they're gonna have the same, not really sharing feature, but it's gonna record your gameplay and you can edit it with an editor and stuff.

813
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:50,894
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kinda cool.

814
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,911
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

815
00:59:15,831 --> 00:59:20,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I take my console and my game on a monitor that has DVIN and VGA.

816
00:59:20,772 --> 00:59:22,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I have my DVI cables now, but whatever.

817
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:27,414
[SPEAKER_06]: If I didn't have those cables, it only has DVIN or VGA in.

818
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do that because, see, I have all these wonderful cables for my Xbox 360.

819
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:32,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a VGA cable.

820
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:33,256
[SPEAKER_06]: They made it.

821
00:59:33,276 --> 00:59:34,116
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fantastic.

822
00:59:34,736 --> 00:59:37,257
[SPEAKER_06]: But now that they got rid of that multi-AV port...

823
00:59:38,397 --> 00:59:39,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stuck with fucking HDMI.

824
00:59:39,918 --> 00:59:47,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I know I could buy a brand new monitor that has HDMI in, but why am I going to fucking spend more money to play a game system that I've got to buy also?

825
00:59:47,946 --> 00:59:49,667
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also going to have more expensive games.

826
00:59:50,368 --> 00:59:51,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do I want to do that?

827
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:57,474
[SPEAKER_05]: VOGKoff in our chatroom brings up another story that kind of ties into the whole Kinect thing.

828
00:59:58,274 --> 01:00:05,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, all the voice commands being demoed on the Xbox One affected all Kinect users on 360, stopping streams and such.

829
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:12,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you read about that, where people that were watching the streams on the 360, the voice commands were fucking with the plug-in.

830
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,260
[SPEAKER_06]: It's even worse than that.

831
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, actual stuff on TV.

832
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:22,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they were showing one episode of someone watching an episode of the Cleveland show, and it was saying something about their, like, stop.

833
01:00:23,024 --> 01:00:25,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to stop that.

834
01:00:25,406 --> 01:00:28,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kept stopping his stream when he was playing it.

835
01:00:28,188 --> 01:00:30,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only way he can do it is mute it to get past it.

836
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:33,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So if my Kinect is plugged in, think about it.

837
01:00:33,832 --> 01:00:39,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody on live television could get up there and just yell into the microphone, Xbox, broadcast!

838
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:40,876
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the old Kinect.

839
01:00:40,896 --> 01:00:42,558
[SPEAKER_06]: The old Kinect doesn't determine.

840
01:00:42,878 --> 01:00:44,039
[SPEAKER_06]: It only listens to sound.

841
01:00:44,279 --> 01:00:48,862
[SPEAKER_06]: The new Kinect is actually going to see you and it's going to know which person is saying that, allegedly.

842
01:00:49,222 --> 01:00:53,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless, of course, you could mime it and then someone else yells it out, in which case it probably wouldn't know.

843
01:00:53,946 --> 01:00:54,506
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

844
01:00:54,747 --> 01:00:56,008
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have a way around that.

845
01:00:56,768 --> 01:00:58,089
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a more sophisticated now.

846
01:00:59,731 --> 01:01:00,071
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

847
01:01:00,811 --> 01:01:02,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that covers most of the bases.

848
01:01:03,233 --> 01:01:06,396
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few other stories that came out after the Xbox One.

849
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:13,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Some things on a positive note, certainly, is that they're talking about a 1 versus 100 style game for Xbox One.

850
01:01:13,642 --> 01:01:17,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at launch, but certainly within the opportunity for the future.

851
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:23,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't necessarily mean it will be 1 versus 100, but you know I never shut up about how great that was and that it died way too soon on 360.

852
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:29,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really excited that they are talking about bringing back that type of idea on Xbox One.

853
01:01:29,294 --> 01:01:31,736
[SPEAKER_05]: That would certainly make the system a lot more attractive.

854
01:01:32,496 --> 01:01:36,620
[SPEAKER_05]: and some YouTubes out there that are skewering the press conference a little bit.

855
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:42,386
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them just repeats TV, TV, TV, Call of Duty, Call of Duty, Call of Duty and sports, sports, sports over and over again.

856
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:48,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that those videos are as hilarious as the PlayStation 3 press conference years ago.

857
01:01:48,631 --> 01:01:52,115
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they had the same guy did it and his was kind of funny.

858
01:01:52,788 --> 01:01:56,431
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, you know, I didn't hate the press conference.

859
01:01:57,132 --> 01:02:00,314
[SPEAKER_05]: The press conference they had was exactly the type of stuff I expected.

860
01:02:00,354 --> 01:02:04,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It's everything that came out after the fact on the internet that's causing the concern.

861
01:02:04,718 --> 01:02:05,959
[SPEAKER_05]: The press conference itself was fine.

862
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no problem with the press conference.

863
01:02:08,341 --> 01:02:09,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was literally all the information.

864
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:13,145
[SPEAKER_06]: After the press conference, I was like, I guess I'm going to have to get an Xbox One.

865
01:02:13,185 --> 01:02:14,546
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after the press conference, I was like...

866
01:02:15,487 --> 01:02:16,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Not with this information, though.

867
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:18,628
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

868
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:26,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other news-type things that we need to bring up that you think we might have missed somewhere along the line?

869
01:02:27,772 --> 01:02:31,494
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 4 is teasing the reveal of their console.

870
01:02:31,534 --> 01:02:32,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I saw it the day before.

871
01:02:32,654 --> 01:02:33,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was funny.

872
01:02:34,689 --> 01:02:36,210
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to open up the Skype line in a moment.

873
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:40,692
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to call in, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use our name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

874
01:02:40,732 --> 01:02:45,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, that is if you are here with us live on Thursday night, May 23rd, 2013.

875
01:02:46,434 --> 01:02:49,855
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're hearing the rebroadcast on Sunday, we're actually not here.

876
01:02:50,195 --> 01:02:51,716
[SPEAKER_05]: We took Memorial Day weekend off, but we'll...

877
01:02:52,376 --> 01:02:53,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you right now with Xbox One?

878
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:15,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I just need to figure out what they're doing.

879
01:03:15,339 --> 01:03:23,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're going back and forth and I don't even know how the used game thing works and what the online only stuff is.

880
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:25,121
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all software anyways.

881
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,422
[SPEAKER_06]: So that can be changed in a drop of a hat.

882
01:03:27,922 --> 01:03:30,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So until it comes out, we don't know.

883
01:03:31,082 --> 01:03:35,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hope that they kind of figure out, hey, maybe that's not a good idea to do that right now.

884
01:03:35,903 --> 01:03:37,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe wait until the next generation.

885
01:03:38,484 --> 01:03:38,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know...

886
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:40,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

887
01:03:40,404 --> 01:03:41,625
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, you know, EA.

888
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:48,106
[SPEAKER_06]: They had news this week that, oh, it's like we're actually developing some games for Wii U, just not as many.

889
01:03:48,987 --> 01:03:56,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so what's to say that EA, I mean, it wouldn't be very popular, but what's to say EA couldn't say, ha ha, just kidding, we're going to have online passes anyways.

890
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,010
[SPEAKER_06]: We changed our minds.

891
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:20,679
[SPEAKER_05]: they're called like freedom passes now I'm in a similar boat where it's like you know what it's just too soon to make a determination on Xbox One there's some things I like that I'm hearing and there's some things I don't like that I'm hearing you know and back to the golden rule of gaming a system is only as good as the games that are on it and although I'm

892
01:04:20,919 --> 01:04:22,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not interested in Quantum Break.

893
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:24,440
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not enough for me right now.

894
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:28,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very curious to see what E3 brings when they unveil these other titles.

895
01:04:28,662 --> 01:04:31,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet there's going to be something in there, especially if Killer Instinct is one of the games.

896
01:04:32,044 --> 01:04:34,545
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that's going to give me great pause.

897
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:40,707
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they screw up this use thing or the connect thing, that could be a deal breaker for me.

898
01:04:41,007 --> 01:04:44,509
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not going to sit here and say, I'm definitely not buying one now.

899
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:48,331
[SPEAKER_05]: because my opinion can damn well flip-flop one way or the other.

900
01:04:48,911 --> 01:04:52,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's just like people going, well, I'm definitely buying a PlayStation 4 now.

901
01:04:52,112 --> 01:04:53,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not buying an Xbox One.

902
01:04:53,353 --> 01:04:55,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, you don't even know what the hell they're doing.

903
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:57,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Sony's got a lot to say, too.

904
01:04:57,755 --> 01:05:04,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we haven't been talking about them tonight because the focus hasn't been on them this week, but there's still a lot of questions they've got to answer, too.

905
01:05:04,478 --> 01:05:06,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we don't know what they're using.

906
01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:08,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they've said that they support you.

907
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, they say they're supporting used games here too.

908
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:11,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

909
01:05:11,945 --> 01:05:13,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft's able to say the same thing.

910
01:05:13,807 --> 01:05:16,571
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of need that to be crystal clear.

911
01:05:18,254 --> 01:05:20,497
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll find out more.

912
01:05:21,158 --> 01:05:23,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, at least I know how my Wii U works.

913
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:32,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to go here with you though, Loki, because you're one of Nintendo's biggest critics.

914
01:05:32,138 --> 01:05:38,620
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was having some Twitter conversations earlier this week and talking about Xbox One and all the tin hat foil theories.

915
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:50,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see a path here where Nintendo could, and I want to sound fanboy here, but do you see a path here where Nintendo could walk away with this holiday season?

916
01:05:51,324 --> 01:05:51,424
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

917
01:05:53,063 --> 01:05:53,544
[SPEAKER_06]: you know why?

918
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:53,946
[SPEAKER_06]: why?

919
01:05:54,046 --> 01:05:59,964
[SPEAKER_06]: because the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 are still out there and I'm sorry, even if even if, you know

920
01:06:01,411 --> 01:06:03,012
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii U does okay.

921
01:06:03,633 --> 01:06:07,496
[SPEAKER_06]: You've still got all the really big games coming out on the current-gen consoles.

922
01:06:08,377 --> 01:06:14,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, we can consider the Wii U a current-gen console, too, because it's pretty much the same as far as graphics go.

923
01:06:15,383 --> 01:06:18,986
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, actually, it won't have Battlefield 4, so there's one strike against it.

924
01:06:19,026 --> 01:06:21,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you may not care for some people.

925
01:06:21,668 --> 01:06:22,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Zelda game, who cares?

926
01:06:23,009 --> 01:06:23,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Kart, who cares?

927
01:06:24,831 --> 01:06:27,294
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think it's going to... I kind of care about Mario Kart.

928
01:06:27,335 --> 01:06:27,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people do.

929
01:06:27,955 --> 01:06:31,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying, like, you know, who cares because you have Mario Kart.

930
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:31,600
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.

931
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:39,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I don't buy all the systems for Mario Kart anyways, so who knows, maybe we'll get a Wii U this fall Right?

932
01:06:39,482 --> 01:07:00,708
[SPEAKER_06]: That's gonna be the hilarious thing that happens I'm gonna laugh so fucking hard if that happens, if Loki ends up walking out with a Wii U this fall Say that now No, I am saying that now, because Mario Kart 7 is kind of lame So, I'm not gonna buy a system for one game, unless they have Excite Truck 2, in which case I will be buying that game See?

933
01:07:00,748 --> 01:07:01,048
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

934
01:07:02,808 --> 01:07:04,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Kart, no, I'm sorry.

935
01:07:04,029 --> 01:07:11,174
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be a big sight truck, and if it's awesome, it'll be... BlackWolfInChat bringing up a little thing that we missed.

936
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:14,016
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have more than 100 friends on Xbox One.

937
01:07:14,036 --> 01:07:14,716
[SPEAKER_05]: 1,000 friends.

938
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:15,076
[SPEAKER_05]: 1,000 friends.

939
01:07:16,577 --> 01:07:20,880
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great, but I have to express a little bit of disappointment that why didn't they just roll that out on 360?

940
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

941
01:07:21,741 --> 01:07:22,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a second.

942
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:24,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, won't it have to be on 360?

943
01:07:25,223 --> 01:07:26,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Because your live account's... That's a good point.

944
01:07:26,944 --> 01:07:29,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Your live account's going to be tied to the Xbox One.

945
01:07:29,686 --> 01:07:29,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

946
01:07:30,086 --> 01:07:32,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So... How's that gonna work?

947
01:07:32,529 --> 01:07:33,249
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that gonna work?

948
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:37,253
[SPEAKER_05]: If I get my friends list up to 150 on the Xbox One, what happens when I go back to my 360?

949
01:07:37,293 --> 01:07:39,796
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gonna have to fix it.

950
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:40,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha!

951
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:40,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you!

952
01:07:40,616 --> 01:07:40,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha!

953
01:07:40,897 --> 01:07:42,298
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw right through it.

954
01:07:42,498 --> 01:07:43,900
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just trying to get us to buy another console.

955
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Case closed.

956
01:07:47,028 --> 01:07:52,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess there's going to have to be a... They're going to need that extra cloud competing to figure out where your other friends are, I guess.

957
01:07:52,213 --> 01:07:52,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

958
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:54,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe only the first hundred will show up.

959
01:07:54,675 --> 01:07:56,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, that would be so... I'm sorry.

960
01:07:56,677 --> 01:08:00,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to give... Only these hundred people get a rose.

961
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:02,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone else will have to go home.

962
01:08:03,649 --> 01:08:07,270
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to go home and live on the Xbox One until I come back and visit you.

963
01:08:09,691 --> 01:08:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're getting close to the end here of our little chat, but I do want to open it up the Skype line and see what you guys have to say.

964
01:08:15,593 --> 01:08:18,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you are listening to us live on this Thursday night, May 23rd, go ahead and give us a call.

965
01:08:18,954 --> 01:08:22,355
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

966
01:08:22,675 --> 01:08:25,236
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know your thoughts on Xbox One.

967
01:08:26,256 --> 01:08:52,869
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the other news to come out from the world of gaming since there is no show this Sunday I want to just throw some of these other things out here real quick release date today for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn August 27th I knew it was August I was guessing a week earlier I was wrong you were wrong August 27th collector edition pre-orders are already available looks like it's I'm excited about XIV Realm Reborn I'd be more excited if it was a pay to play and that was it no monthly fee

968
01:08:53,589 --> 01:09:13,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to buy it Who knows One of the last holdouts is going free to play in June Rift is finally going free to play Come on Final Fantasy 11 What the hell I seriously can't think of any games that charge a monthly fee at this point besides WoW and Final Fantasy 11 and 14 or in the future 14

969
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:17,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see Mario and Wario's Crowd Farter?

970
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:31,759
[SPEAKER_05]: The Little Parody of Kickstarter.

971
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:33,240
[SPEAKER_05]: That was some great shade.

972
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:38,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I was really a fan of that, what they did there.

973
01:09:38,163 --> 01:09:42,925
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole, like, if you share on Facebook and Twitter and it gets to certain levels, they'll unlock.

974
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:50,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted, a lot of the stuff they're talking about unlocking is kind of dumb, like, you know, backgrounds and new trailers and things like that, which is a little silly.

975
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:56,592
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really love some of the parody they did of Kickstarters with their little crowd farter.

976
01:09:56,632 --> 01:09:57,313
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty funny.

977
01:09:58,133 --> 01:10:04,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to talk to us about the Xbox One.

978
01:10:05,598 --> 01:10:13,884
[SPEAKER_05]: EA may have backtracked a little bit on their earlier statements about the Wii U. This was coming from a comment from... I'm trying to bring it up here.

979
01:10:18,137 --> 01:10:21,618
[SPEAKER_05]: This was from Jeff Brown, who is an EA spokesperson.

980
01:10:21,978 --> 01:10:25,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, that was the person who originally said no games in development for the Wii U currently.

981
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen, quote, And not in 2013.

982
01:10:45,566 --> 01:10:45,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

983
01:10:45,986 --> 01:10:47,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wonder what it is they're doing.

984
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:49,247
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't announced anything.

985
01:10:49,267 --> 01:10:50,147
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing coming.

986
01:10:50,487 --> 01:10:53,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they do maybe a port of Need for Speed when that comes out.

987
01:10:53,688 --> 01:10:56,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe a port of whatever Star Wars project's coming up.

988
01:10:56,628 --> 01:11:06,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if the Wii U is the, and I'm using my little quotey fingers, kiddie console, then maybe a Star Wars thing on the Wii U would make a lot of sense.

989
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:09,831
[SPEAKER_06]: They could do a Lego Star Wars game, another one, or something like that.

990
01:11:11,411 --> 01:11:25,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I can guarantee that they don't have NCAA, they don't have FIFA, they don't have Madden, they don't have NBA Live as a Wii U title and definitely not Battlefield.

991
01:11:25,954 --> 01:11:31,475
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, I don't think there's anything left this year that EA is putting out that has a Wii U title to it.

992
01:11:31,575 --> 01:11:32,756
[SPEAKER_06]: They have nothing coming.

993
01:11:33,736 --> 01:11:38,317
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's anything, it's going to be 2014 and maybe the next round of sports games.

994
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:38,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they're going to

995
01:11:39,737 --> 01:11:44,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I think they're going to take a wait-and-see approach and see how the sales go of the console.

996
01:11:44,722 --> 01:11:48,465
[SPEAKER_06]: If it picks up in the fall, then it'll warrant them making a Wii U version.

997
01:11:48,706 --> 01:11:49,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always what it's been.

998
01:11:49,626 --> 01:11:55,011
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not been, I don't think, a personal vendetta against them or something because of any sort of draconian DRM thing.

999
01:11:55,072 --> 01:11:55,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Or tinfoil.

1000
01:11:57,854 --> 01:12:00,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it makes sense because everybody's doing it.

1001
01:12:00,615 --> 01:12:01,456
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just EA.

1002
01:12:01,496 --> 01:12:05,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's not making stuff for the Wii U because they're just not selling to make consoles.

1003
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:11,663
[SPEAKER_06]: It costs a lot of money to port your game over and if you're only going to sell like 100,000 copies then it's not worth it.

1004
01:12:13,874 --> 01:12:18,115
[SPEAKER_05]: to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.

1005
01:12:18,495 --> 01:12:21,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Use the passphrase, dress.

1006
01:12:21,135 --> 01:12:24,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Square Enix apparently going to be doing some E3 video shows.

1007
01:12:24,756 --> 01:12:26,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Shocking, it's a video.

1008
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:32,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least they're not making everybody get tickets to go in the theater to just sit there and watch a bunch of trailers.

1009
01:12:32,377 --> 01:12:33,818
[SPEAKER_05]: At least they're not doing that, to be fair.

1010
01:12:33,838 --> 01:12:34,238
[SPEAKER_06]: They should.

1011
01:12:34,258 --> 01:12:36,418
[SPEAKER_06]: They should make you get tickets and wait online.

1012
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:37,218
[SPEAKER_05]: You think?

1013
01:12:37,258 --> 01:12:37,998
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of funny.

1014
01:12:38,038 --> 01:12:38,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the phones.

1015
01:12:38,879 --> 01:12:39,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, it's lighting up.

1016
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:40,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1017
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:41,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1018
01:12:42,162 --> 01:12:42,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's Sterlok.

1019
01:12:43,203 --> 01:12:44,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Sterlok, what's up, buddy?

1020
01:12:46,005 --> 01:12:49,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much, just wanted to talk about the Xbox One a little bit here.

1021
01:12:49,608 --> 01:12:54,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you had a very interesting Twitter rant earlier this week that a lot of people might not be thinking of.

1022
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:56,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you were going to tap into that.

1023
01:12:57,434 --> 01:12:58,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.

1024
01:12:59,815 --> 01:13:00,896
[SPEAKER_04]: That's definitely part of it.

1025
01:13:01,597 --> 01:13:09,803
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, well, we don't know if this is... Do we know if this is actually true or not, the whole code thing?

1026
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:10,720
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't.

1027
01:13:11,201 --> 01:13:16,605
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not going to say one way or the other until E3.

1028
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:19,787
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of vague vagueness right now, so we just don't know.

1029
01:13:19,847 --> 01:13:23,910
[SPEAKER_05]: We have nothing but internet wank to go off of and conspiracy tinfoil hat theories.

1030
01:13:24,831 --> 01:13:25,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I figured.

1031
01:13:27,213 --> 01:13:38,061
[SPEAKER_04]: If they do go that route and you have to enter a code, say on the box, like the online passes worked, that essentially means that

1032
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:49,273
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to play a new game on the Xbox One, I'm going to have to get someone cited to enter the code for me.

1033
01:13:49,713 --> 01:13:58,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes it might be a little while before someone's got the time that can do that.

1034
01:14:01,116 --> 01:14:06,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Like with the 360 and every other console, I can't just buy a game and pop it in the system.

1035
01:14:06,577 --> 01:14:06,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1036
01:14:09,203 --> 01:14:12,205
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know if it's going to work that way.

1037
01:14:12,565 --> 01:14:20,708
[SPEAKER_05]: As a blind gamer, do you run into accessibility issues on any current gen consoles when it comes to being able to just kind of pop in and play a new game?

1038
01:14:20,868 --> 01:14:22,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever have to get assistance there?

1039
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:30,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mostly just memorizing how the layout of the menus and stuff work.

1040
01:14:30,912 --> 01:14:32,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to kind of

1041
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:38,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to do it again probably when they update the 360s dashboard.

1042
01:14:40,185 --> 01:14:45,869
[SPEAKER_04]: But especially just memorizing the dashboard just to know how the hell to get to the XBLA games.

1043
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:48,251
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really all it is.

1044
01:14:48,351 --> 01:14:49,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that big of a deal.

1045
01:14:50,017 --> 01:14:52,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hopefully they will do some type of accessibility.

1046
01:14:52,679 --> 01:15:02,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can understand why they can't spend a lot of time at their 60-minute little unveiling to talk about accessibility, but it would be nice to hear a little bit about that.

1047
01:15:03,969 --> 01:15:05,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And they could do it.

1048
01:15:08,353 --> 01:15:17,701
[SPEAKER_04]: What a lot of people are pushing for now, and I think this argument has a little more traction now with this whole all-in-one thing

1049
01:15:18,331 --> 01:15:21,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Entertainment Center, the thing that they're trying to do.

1050
01:15:21,993 --> 01:15:26,375
[SPEAKER_04]: There really should be some sort of accessibility thing built in.

1051
01:15:26,535 --> 01:15:41,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Windows 8 now has, they redid their narrator screen reader, which they've kind of always had, but it's always been sort of a joke.

1052
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:41,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1053
01:15:44,524 --> 01:15:47,586
[SPEAKER_04]: But they redid it for Windows 8, and it's actually not that bad.

1054
01:15:47,886 --> 01:15:48,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1055
01:15:49,262 --> 01:15:53,385
[SPEAKER_04]: They could probably, if they really wanted to, do.

1056
01:15:53,465 --> 01:16:01,611
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, honestly, we're just such a small market, really, that it doesn't really matter to do them.

1057
01:16:01,651 --> 01:16:04,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really cost effective for them to do that.

1058
01:16:04,533 --> 01:16:09,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's such a... I don't know, that perspective would just be so harsh.

1059
01:16:09,656 --> 01:16:12,158
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks, but... It's not cool, you know?

1060
01:16:12,758 --> 01:16:13,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1061
01:16:13,139 --> 01:16:14,019
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me not want to like them.

1062
01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:15,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks, but it's just the way it is.

1063
01:16:16,161 --> 01:16:16,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1064
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:16,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1065
01:16:17,133 --> 01:16:20,614
[SPEAKER_04]: But with the voice commands, that does alleviate some of it.

1066
01:16:21,454 --> 01:16:22,774
[SPEAKER_04]: With the connect voice commands.

1067
01:16:23,154 --> 01:16:30,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's... Okay, so I guess there's a positive in there, is that, yeah, if you can kind of drive the entire console with your voice, you may not need to memorize the menus, right?

1068
01:16:31,596 --> 01:16:32,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

1069
01:16:32,877 --> 01:16:41,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I could just say, hey, play... I don't know, well, I can't say another XBLA, play Guardian Heroes or something.

1070
01:16:41,799 --> 01:16:42,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

1071
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:43,659
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um...

1072
01:16:45,177 --> 01:16:47,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, XBLA games, you'd think they could...

1073
01:16:59,335 --> 01:17:00,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Figure something out.

1074
01:17:00,635 --> 01:17:02,016
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the chipset.

1075
01:17:02,896 --> 01:17:09,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it sucks, but I'm hoping that it has long-term payoff with better games.

1076
01:17:10,878 --> 01:17:15,219
[SPEAKER_05]: It would sure add a lot of better value if we could have the backwards compatibility, that's for sure.

1077
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:21,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I wanted to bring up, I don't know if it's in the show role, but this Rare announcement.

1078
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:22,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1079
01:17:24,062 --> 01:17:25,002
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think it's going to be?

1080
01:17:25,382 --> 01:17:25,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1081
01:17:26,755 --> 01:17:32,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Killer Instinct is pretty much the one thing that will guarantee me, no matter what they do with the Xbox One, that will guarantee me a purchase.

1082
01:17:32,837 --> 01:17:33,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Killer Instinct, man, that's

1083
01:17:53,425 --> 01:17:55,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything with Killer Instinct on it, I will buy.

1084
01:17:56,809 --> 01:18:01,475
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll sell these morals about codes and things like that for some more Killer Instinct.

1085
01:18:01,495 --> 01:18:04,219
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of gamers that are like that.

1086
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,181
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the best fighting games ever fucking made.

1087
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:08,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell Loki about it.

1088
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:10,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as long as they get the original announcer back.

1089
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:16,293
[SPEAKER_04]: They gotta get that original announcer with the ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-bo breaker.

1090
01:18:18,175 --> 01:18:18,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1091
01:18:19,175 --> 01:18:23,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Sterlok, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but any other last thoughts for our listeners?

1092
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... E3 is gonna be really interesting this year.

1093
01:18:29,244 --> 01:18:30,165
[SPEAKER_05]: To say the least.

1094
01:18:30,725 --> 01:18:31,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, buddy, you take care.

1095
01:18:31,646 --> 01:18:33,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you too.

1096
01:18:33,287 --> 01:18:33,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, bye.

1097
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:37,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Now our phone's ringing a little bit more.

1098
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to another call.

1099
01:18:38,501 --> 01:18:39,562
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have another call coming in.

1100
01:18:39,902 --> 01:18:40,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Moms Radio.

1101
01:18:40,763 --> 01:18:41,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1102
01:18:41,723 --> 01:18:42,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, it's Shane.

1103
01:18:42,724 --> 01:18:43,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Shane.

1104
01:18:43,384 --> 01:18:43,925
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

1105
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I am fine.

1106
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:47,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday.

1107
01:18:48,468 --> 01:18:48,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1108
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:51,170
[SPEAKER_05]: You're listening to this little show on your birthday?

1109
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:55,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like almost midnight here, so the day's pretty much over.

1110
01:18:55,492 --> 01:18:55,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1111
01:18:56,113 --> 01:18:57,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Your 30th birthday, nonetheless.

1112
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:00,396
[SPEAKER_05]: My 25th birthday.

1113
01:19:00,436 --> 01:19:01,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1114
01:19:01,316 --> 01:19:02,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Bobby Blackwolf.

1115
01:19:02,377 --> 01:19:02,677
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1116
01:19:03,598 --> 01:19:04,298
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

1117
01:19:04,318 --> 01:19:05,159
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want to say tonight?

1118
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:09,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so excited for Final Fantasy XIV after today.

1119
01:19:09,863 --> 01:19:13,166
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to say?

1120
01:19:13,486 --> 01:19:15,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute, you didn't call in to talk about Xbox One?

1121
01:19:16,429 --> 01:19:18,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares about that stupid system?

1122
01:19:20,092 --> 01:19:31,602
[SPEAKER_02]: For my job, which I'm sure I've talked about what my job is, but I don't need to say it now, but I was talking with retail people about it on Wednesday.

1123
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:32,422
[SPEAKER_02]: People that work at maybe...

1124
01:19:33,379 --> 01:19:38,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Target and Walmart and GameStop and all that, nobody had something positive to say about it.

1125
01:19:39,646 --> 01:19:41,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was hating on it.

1126
01:19:41,388 --> 01:19:43,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single person I talked to.

1127
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:47,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they hating on the press conference or were they hating on the internet hysteria that happened afterwards?

1128
01:19:47,635 --> 01:19:48,997
[SPEAKER_02]: They were hating on...

1129
01:19:49,537 --> 01:19:51,878
[SPEAKER_02]: The details that were being said.

1130
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:59,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing about what a waste of an hour that was or man, everybody's up in arms on the internet.

1131
01:19:59,643 --> 01:20:05,166
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, this is the stuff that I read about that came out of that conference.

1132
01:20:05,707 --> 01:20:07,768
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I saw at the conference.

1133
01:20:08,128 --> 01:20:10,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about anything they said.

1134
01:20:10,289 --> 01:20:12,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yeah, okay.

1135
01:20:12,851 --> 01:20:13,571
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.

1136
01:20:14,732 --> 01:20:16,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Same boat as most everybody.

1137
01:20:18,766 --> 01:20:20,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's your head at with Xbox One right now?

1138
01:20:20,868 --> 01:20:22,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it something you think you would pick up?

1139
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:26,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer Instinct can't make me pick that up, and that says a lot.

1140
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:29,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I love Killer Instinct.

1141
01:20:29,515 --> 01:20:31,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't E3 still change your mind?

1142
01:20:31,897 --> 01:20:40,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what if it does turn out this situation with the used games and the Kinect is not as bad as we're all making it out to be, and E3 shows us everything's just fine?

1143
01:20:40,304 --> 01:20:41,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that change your mind?

1144
01:20:41,613 --> 01:20:55,467
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because before going into the press event, Microsoft doesn't have anything exclusive that I care enough about that would make me want to shell out the money for a brand new VCR.

1145
01:20:56,368 --> 01:20:56,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

1146
01:20:57,949 --> 01:21:02,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I, with the other two companies, they have exclusives I care about.

1147
01:21:02,713 --> 01:21:10,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft had Alan Wake, which they don't really do anything with anymore, and Dance Central, which I'll get by.

1148
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:12,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get by not having Dance Central.

1149
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:21,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows if it'll stay Connect, or Microsoft only, or if it will go to Sony's new camera-y thing.

1150
01:21:21,446 --> 01:21:21,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1151
01:21:21,907 --> 01:21:22,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1152
01:21:22,527 --> 01:21:37,517
[SPEAKER_02]: but those two wouldn't have been enough and if somehow they let Rare do something cool and like make Killer Instinct well honestly Killer Instinct 1 was fantastic and 2 was crap so they don't really have a great

1153
01:21:38,297 --> 01:21:40,178
[SPEAKER_02]: History either with that franchise.

1154
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:45,442
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the now defunct Silicon Knights.

1155
01:21:45,562 --> 01:21:48,364
[SPEAKER_02]: They make one good game and everything else they make is crap.

1156
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:52,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm laughing at what Alan Alchemy says in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1157
01:21:53,287 --> 01:21:56,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect 4, Kden Academy, Xbox One exclusive.

1158
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:58,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that change your mind?

1159
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:00,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1160
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:03,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

1161
01:22:03,922 --> 01:22:04,462
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1162
01:22:04,582 --> 01:22:15,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if Mass Effect somehow became an exclusive there and didn't require Kinect stuff, then... See, the right game will make you sell all your morals.

1163
01:22:15,526 --> 01:22:20,969
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think it would be possible for it to do that because EA wants money and they're not going to put...

1164
01:22:22,009 --> 01:22:51,418
[SPEAKER_02]: a game like Mass Effect on one system again they did that for Mass Effect 1 I've seen weirder things happen in gaming alright I gotta wrap up soon so we can get more calls but I do want you to have your say on Final Fantasy 14 so what would you like to say about Realm Reborn everybody needs to watch the new trailer it's beautiful and the box art for the collector's edition is super pretty and I am so pumped up for this game that I pre-ordered it twice why would you pre-order it twice I don't get it

1165
01:22:52,378 --> 01:23:02,715
[SPEAKER_02]: because I want the collector's edition and I want a way to play it on PS3 but I did not want the PS3 collector's edition.

1166
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:08,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright Anything else Shane before I let you go?

1167
01:23:10,794 --> 01:23:30,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby I can talk about whatever I want when I'm on the phone I don't want to talk about the Xbox Don't use this as a platform to yell at chatters Go into chat room and yell at him that way Take care Shane Oh he hung up on me Jerk I hope your birthday sucks What's left of it?

1168
01:23:30,787 --> 01:23:31,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Six minutes

1169
01:23:33,849 --> 01:23:34,189
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1170
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:36,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you get an earthquake in the next six minutes.

1171
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:37,310
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

1172
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:38,010
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

1173
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:38,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean that.

1174
01:23:38,951 --> 01:23:39,231
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1175
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:40,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the phones.

1176
01:23:40,491 --> 01:23:41,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

1177
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:41,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1178
01:23:42,612 --> 01:23:43,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is Actdeft.

1179
01:23:43,452 --> 01:23:44,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Actdeft.

1180
01:23:44,072 --> 01:23:44,533
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

1181
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:49,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, talking about the X-Bone or the X-B1, whatever.

1182
01:23:49,614 --> 01:23:50,574
[SPEAKER_05]: The X-Boner, yeah.

1183
01:23:52,535 --> 01:24:01,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one thing most people don't, well, I think they haven't talked or thought into consideration is the price.

1184
01:24:02,109 --> 01:24:07,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, how about if the XB1 or even the PS4

1185
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:21,509
[SPEAKER_03]: are cheap enough to even, it doesn't matter the factor of all the crappy things they're announcing for it, maybe if the price is low,

1186
01:24:23,657 --> 01:24:24,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Will people get it?

1187
01:24:25,138 --> 01:24:53,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, these rumors keep going around, which, you know, Xbox or Microsoft rumors tend to be true, which is funny because it came up on one of our list lists, you know, last year, that Xbox could go the subsidy route, where maybe an Xbox One will only cost you $199.99, but with a two-year contract obligation to Xbox Gold or Xbox Network for Halo TV or whatever they decide to add in with it.

1188
01:24:55,100 --> 01:25:07,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it may work, but I really wonder if people will just go ahead and buy it, even or despite all the things, just because it's cheap.

1189
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:13,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's most of what I think right now.

1190
01:25:14,153 --> 01:25:20,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Though, in general, I wouldn't get an Xbox One, at least not at launch, maybe.

1191
01:25:21,858 --> 01:25:29,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly because it doesn't have a component or an RCA port, so I don't have an HDTV.

1192
01:25:30,263 --> 01:25:30,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1193
01:25:31,723 --> 01:25:39,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And most people I know maybe do have an HDTV that handles HDMI, but...

1194
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:57,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that many people I have a pretty early HD TV where mine only had component cables it wasn't capable of doing 1080p either it could do 1080i but not 1080p see my other TV I have only has DVI and it can only do 1080i

1195
01:25:57,921 --> 01:26:03,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so, yeah, you couldn't, I couldn't do, that's the TV that's in our bedroom, I couldn't do an HDMI.

1196
01:26:03,343 --> 01:26:11,426
[SPEAKER_06]: That reminds me, so, I know that's gonna support, you know, those resolutions and stuff, but is it gonna get all fucked up when you try to hook up your system?

1197
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:12,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it gonna try to do 1080p?

1198
01:26:12,887 --> 01:26:17,629
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh, sorry, can't do 1080p on this TV, so, fuck you.

1199
01:26:17,649 --> 01:26:18,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

1200
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:23,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a lot of people have only 720 TVs, though, because of, like, $299 sales at Walmart and whatever.

1201
01:26:24,191 --> 01:26:26,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I don't know how it's gonna work.

1202
01:26:27,509 --> 01:26:31,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it will have native resolution.

1203
01:26:32,092 --> 01:26:32,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know.

1204
01:26:33,013 --> 01:26:36,435
[SPEAKER_05]: What if there was a converter, something you could do to convert the signal?

1205
01:26:36,535 --> 01:26:38,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that change your mind?

1206
01:26:38,296 --> 01:26:38,656
[SPEAKER_05]: You can.

1207
01:26:40,177 --> 01:26:45,661
[SPEAKER_03]: There is HDMI to DVI or even, I think, component.

1208
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:47,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one of those.

1209
01:26:47,762 --> 01:26:52,305
[SPEAKER_03]: But even then, it's like not having the greatest quality.

1210
01:26:53,026 --> 01:26:55,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wouldn't get that even...

1211
01:26:56,997 --> 01:27:00,901
[SPEAKER_03]: even though I could easily get a replacement for it.

1212
01:27:02,682 --> 01:27:04,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather have an HDTV.

1213
01:27:04,924 --> 01:27:16,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ranma, I know HDTVs are cheap in the United States, but get on my side of the border, those things are hell expensive.

1214
01:27:17,904 --> 01:27:22,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a response to a comment from Ranma who said, HDTVs are cheap, don't give me that shit.

1215
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:27,936
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you live in Mexico and there might be fees to import things and whatever.

1216
01:27:28,517 --> 01:27:32,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it doesn't cost the same that it would here, so it makes sense.

1217
01:27:34,933 --> 01:27:37,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you sometimes travel to the States, though, to make big purchases?

1218
01:27:38,035 --> 01:27:38,456
[SPEAKER_05]: You could.

1219
01:27:38,616 --> 01:27:39,256
[SPEAKER_05]: You could, right?

1220
01:27:39,757 --> 01:27:55,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I could, yeah, but it's still something that isn't easy to do because the customs, if you have certain merchandise over a certain price, you have to, well, register.

1221
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:56,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Declare it and all that.

1222
01:27:56,891 --> 01:27:57,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:27:59,113 --> 01:28:27,206
[SPEAKER_05]: well okay but so basically your big hold up on Xbox One is that it's just going to be too big of a pain in the ass to actually play the thing and I'm getting the sense there's really nothing yet I mean granted we haven't had E3 but there's nothing yet that's really selling you on the system but could I mean if they come out at E3 and say Killer Instinct are we going to be having a different conversation or is there a game that would make you go alright I'll get in the car and drive to get my HDTV I mean is there any game that would make you start putting that in motion

1224
01:28:28,146 --> 01:28:29,067
[SPEAKER_03]: They already have it.

1225
01:28:29,167 --> 01:28:30,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Force of Five.

1226
01:28:32,471 --> 01:28:35,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Force of Five, but the console isn't...

1227
01:28:37,296 --> 01:28:38,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to...

1228
01:29:06,809 --> 01:29:11,871
[SPEAKER_03]: to justify buying the console and getting all the trouble or passing all the trouble.

1229
01:29:12,171 --> 01:29:15,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to say, though, as much as Forza 5 looks cool, I want a Forza Horizon 2.

1230
01:29:16,653 --> 01:29:18,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1231
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:20,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't hate me, but I don't even really like the Forza games.

1232
01:29:20,535 --> 01:29:24,557
[SPEAKER_05]: But because Forza Horizon was more of like an arcade style, I loved it.

1233
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:26,217
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I want?

1234
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:29,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I want, and just because we don't have it yet,

1235
01:29:30,499 --> 01:29:32,201
[SPEAKER_06]: How many consoles are launching right now?

1236
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:34,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And no fucking Ridge Racer.

1237
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:35,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1238
01:29:35,504 --> 01:29:37,125
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no Ridge Racer.

1239
01:29:37,746 --> 01:29:40,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Good question.

1240
01:29:41,029 --> 01:29:41,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait for E3.

1241
01:29:41,429 --> 01:29:42,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I want Ridge Racer.

1242
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:42,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1243
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:43,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked Ridge Racer 6.

1244
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Ridge Racer 6 is awesome.

1245
01:29:47,174 --> 01:29:51,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Sony should make a nod to their little blunder from a few years ago.

1246
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:54,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think they should get Kazurai up on stage to go.

1247
01:29:54,801 --> 01:29:56,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And ladies and gentlemen, one more game, you guys.

1248
01:29:57,139 --> 01:29:58,760
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Ridge Racer!

1249
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Even better.

1250
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:07,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I want him to come out on a Power Wheels, like Corvette or something like that, and he's all, Ridge Racer!

1251
01:30:09,326 --> 01:30:11,708
[SPEAKER_05]: With the little bike helmet crashing off the stage, yes.

1252
01:30:12,128 --> 01:30:12,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1253
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:13,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1254
01:30:13,469 --> 01:30:14,329
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be hilarious.

1255
01:30:14,369 --> 01:30:15,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Actdeft, I gotta let you go.

1256
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:18,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna try to squeeze in one more call, but thanks for the call and the insight.

1257
01:30:18,792 --> 01:30:19,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, thanks.

1258
01:30:19,553 --> 01:30:20,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.

1259
01:30:20,433 --> 01:30:20,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, no problem.

1260
01:30:21,013 --> 01:30:21,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, buddy.

1261
01:30:22,034 --> 01:30:23,715
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll try to squeeze in one more call.

1262
01:30:23,735 --> 01:30:26,756
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1263
01:30:27,036 --> 01:30:28,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, you can also always email your thoughts.

1264
01:30:29,016 --> 01:30:32,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com I did see a couple emails in there already.

1265
01:30:32,737 --> 01:30:36,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll save those for Jamie next Sunday's show.

1266
01:30:36,439 --> 01:30:39,359
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 10 o'clock on the West Coast and I know it's like 1am for you guys on the East Coast.

1267
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to wrap up here pretty soon.

1268
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:44,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll do Mailbag more on next week's show.

1269
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:46,862
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do want to see if we can get one more call in.

1270
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:50,163
[SPEAKER_05]: So 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1271
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:56,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we get to whatever call comes in, any other news that came out this week we want to get to?

1272
01:30:57,729 --> 01:31:00,791
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new game from Techland that they announced.

1273
01:31:00,891 --> 01:31:02,653
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a zombie free-running game.

1274
01:31:02,673 --> 01:31:06,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like Mirror's Edge crossed with Dead Island.

1275
01:31:07,577 --> 01:31:08,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks neat.

1276
01:31:09,959 --> 01:31:10,460
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 2014.

1277
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:17,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I know that there was some Amazon overseas stuff that listed Mirror's Edge 2.

1278
01:31:17,546 --> 01:31:21,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's wishful thinking or maybe they're going to announce a new Mirror's Edge game.

1279
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:23,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good to me either way.

1280
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:24,072
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be nice.

1281
01:31:24,893 --> 01:31:27,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if that's one of the 15 games.

1282
01:31:27,955 --> 01:31:28,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Might be.

1283
01:31:28,376 --> 01:31:28,616
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1284
01:31:28,636 --> 01:31:29,057
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1285
01:31:29,077 --> 01:31:30,098
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have one more call coming in.

1286
01:31:30,138 --> 01:31:31,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's let's go to the phones and take it.

1287
01:31:32,139 --> 01:31:33,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1288
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:33,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1289
01:31:33,861 --> 01:31:34,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, this is Zappy.

1290
01:31:34,962 --> 01:31:35,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Zappy.

1291
01:31:35,603 --> 01:31:36,063
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

1292
01:31:36,604 --> 01:31:37,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty good.

1293
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Long time no talk.

1294
01:31:38,165 --> 01:31:38,565
[SPEAKER_05]: How you been?

1295
01:31:39,446 --> 01:31:39,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.

1296
01:31:39,887 --> 01:31:40,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't complain.

1297
01:31:40,607 --> 01:31:40,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

1298
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,248
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1299
01:31:41,648 --> 01:31:44,771
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out this Xbox one.

1300
01:31:44,911 --> 01:31:45,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1301
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,801
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to crash and burn.

1302
01:31:48,302 --> 01:31:49,963
[SPEAKER_00]: This feels like Windows 8 Take 2.

1303
01:31:51,284 --> 01:31:51,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you say that?

1304
01:31:53,025 --> 01:31:55,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, they're building it off Windows.

1305
01:31:55,327 --> 01:32:05,835
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking at the conference about using the Windows kernel and they're putting that little snapping thing on the side because what you want to be doing while you're playing a game is using the internet or whatever.

1306
01:32:05,995 --> 01:32:07,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, maybe for FAQs, but...

1307
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:17,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that is one thing we didn't see at the press conference that I did expect to see more of is that we didn't really see any type of like, this is how it works with your PC.

1308
01:32:17,986 --> 01:32:22,009
[SPEAKER_05]: We did see the tablet thing, but they didn't say it was specific to Windows Phone or Windows Tablet.

1309
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:25,232
[SPEAKER_05]: They implied it would work with iPads, but they don't want to say that.

1310
01:32:26,313 --> 01:32:29,295
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't see as much of that as I thought we would.

1311
01:32:29,536 --> 01:32:31,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a single mention of Windows 8 that I recall.

1312
01:32:32,598 --> 01:32:35,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like they only said Windows kernel, which could mean anything.

1313
01:32:35,741 --> 01:32:37,502
[SPEAKER_00]: They could even have Metro apps.

1314
01:32:37,843 --> 01:32:38,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?

1315
01:32:39,424 --> 01:32:44,948
[SPEAKER_00]: But what seemed like most interesting was the Skype looked exactly like it looked in Windows 8.

1316
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:51,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, you know, I understand, though, that they want to keep like a similar look and feel and what have you.

1317
01:32:51,974 --> 01:32:55,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that's why they have their kernels so they can run the Windows 8 apps.

1318
01:32:56,858 --> 01:32:59,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why else would you have three kernels on that goddamn thing?

1319
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:28,558
[SPEAKER_05]: they also have 8 cores to be playing around with so they gotta be doing something with it you know that makes me think that it would be so easy to make games for Xbox One because you know you can make the games in Windows or whatever and then I go oh yeah one thing we didn't touch on earlier in the show they're not gonna let Indies self-publish it's the one platform where Indies are not gonna be able to self-publish I don't think they've said anything yet about that but didn't they say they were gonna have something they were backpedaling yeah okay so they're backpedaling on somebody's way too soon comment alright fair enough

1320
01:33:29,638 --> 01:33:36,303
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that scared me about the Skyping is I get to the nice ending of Halo 5 and, oh, I got a Skype call completely ruining the ending for me.

1321
01:33:38,185 --> 01:33:40,686
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can set your Skype to do not disturb, right?

1322
01:33:41,507 --> 01:33:44,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, but half the time I probably wouldn't remember.

1323
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:45,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

1324
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:49,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that made me think that maybe the true next generation is the Steam Box.

1325
01:33:51,034 --> 01:33:54,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where you think you might go with gaming right now?

1326
01:33:55,441 --> 01:34:00,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a nice little box that plugs into my TV, fully backwards compatible with all the games I bought before.

1327
01:34:01,224 --> 01:34:02,765
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to seem really appealing.

1328
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:05,986
[SPEAKER_05]: But is there anything Microsoft could do to win you over?

1329
01:34:06,026 --> 01:34:12,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked with a lot of the previous callers about that one game that's going to get you to just go back on everything you said.

1330
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:14,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there something out there that might do that for you?

1331
01:34:16,161 --> 01:34:16,942
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.

1332
01:34:17,182 --> 01:34:18,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking about it.

1333
01:34:18,223 --> 01:34:27,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Sony has a lot more exclusives than I'd want to be playing that might maybe backfill, but Microsoft, like, Gears of War isn't exactly this killer game I need to play.

1334
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:30,097
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun, but it's not the game I need.

1335
01:34:30,137 --> 01:34:32,019
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think there's anything Microsoft can do.

1336
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:33,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

1337
01:34:34,662 --> 01:34:36,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and there's going to be some people that are like that.

1338
01:34:36,463 --> 01:34:44,548
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just like, you know what, there's really nothing, and I certainly know people like that, there's really nothing Microsoft has to offer that's going to convince me to get the console.

1339
01:34:44,808 --> 01:34:48,230
[SPEAKER_05]: What about other, are you currently a Wii U owner at all?

1340
01:34:49,951 --> 01:34:54,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I saw it at Costco for $200 for the core unit, and I still couldn't bring myself to buy it.

1341
01:34:55,134 --> 01:34:55,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1342
01:34:56,435 --> 01:35:00,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there just is no games, and there's none coming out on the horizon.

1343
01:35:00,477 --> 01:35:01,558
[SPEAKER_00]: What, Wind Waker?

1344
01:35:01,758 --> 01:35:03,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I played that for the billionth time.

1345
01:35:03,942 --> 01:35:06,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to be fair, wait for E3, you never know.

1346
01:35:06,103 --> 01:35:14,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't think you should buy a console in anticipation of games six months from now, but, you know, there might be something that'll make you go, okay, I gotta start saving up for the holiday.

1347
01:35:15,447 --> 01:35:19,029
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, Nintendo needs to be having their E3 conference, so that doesn't give a lot of faith.

1348
01:35:19,429 --> 01:35:20,490
[SPEAKER_00]: What about PlayStation 4?

1349
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:23,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mildly optimistic.

1350
01:35:24,431 --> 01:35:31,555
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so far what they've shown me, but it's good, but I haven't seen much of it because they just showed off a couple of early games.

1351
01:35:31,955 --> 01:35:32,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1352
01:35:32,868 --> 01:36:02,112
[SPEAKER_05]: probably not in 2013 because Killzone isn't selling me on a console anything else you want to share with the listeners before I let you go or wrap up the show that's it good to hear from you, take care you too later that's going to do it for our calls tonight thank you guys for calling in sorry if you wanted to call in and you didn't get through but remember you can always email your thoughts mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com any other things we want to touch on tonight Loki?

1353
01:36:03,467 --> 01:36:05,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Onomatoguchi's new album is awesome.

1354
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,429
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I hear.

1355
01:36:06,449 --> 01:36:07,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to check it out.

1356
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:12,432
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go kickstart it, you might find that in their updates, they have the album for you.

1357
01:36:12,452 --> 01:36:13,053
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1358
01:36:13,813 --> 01:36:14,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1359
01:36:14,614 --> 01:36:14,874
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1360
01:36:14,934 --> 01:36:21,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, all the segments you know from the show will be back next week when we do the show again, which would be Sunday.

1361
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:24,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to look at the day here.

1362
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the show before E3.

1363
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:27,561
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it would be Sunday, June 2nd.

1364
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:30,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait for more next Xbox name rumors

1365
01:36:47,634 --> 01:36:47,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1366
01:36:48,695 --> 01:36:49,336
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

1367
01:36:49,356 --> 01:36:51,798
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not going to be any because they were announcing it.

1368
01:36:51,838 --> 01:36:53,520
[SPEAKER_06]: There could be peripheral cells.

1369
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:54,861
[SPEAKER_06]: There should be some.

1370
01:36:55,562 --> 01:36:57,203
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be the Xbox 2.

1371
01:36:59,466 --> 01:36:59,806
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1372
01:37:00,827 --> 01:37:03,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, before we close up shop tonight, do you have any final thoughts, Loki?

1373
01:37:05,485 --> 01:37:12,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so VOG game night's going to be tomorrow night now, which will be Friday if you're listening to this on the podcast.

1374
01:37:12,913 --> 01:37:13,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're too late.

1375
01:37:14,715 --> 01:37:15,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily.

1376
01:37:15,255 --> 01:37:16,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put the podcast up tonight.

1377
01:37:16,877 --> 01:37:17,457
[SPEAKER_06]: So Friday.

1378
01:37:17,718 --> 01:37:22,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Friday around 8 to 8.30 because we usually let Josh stay up a little later on Fridays.

1379
01:37:23,684 --> 01:37:24,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Team Fortress 2.

1380
01:37:24,765 --> 01:37:24,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1381
01:37:25,826 --> 01:37:27,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Free, so go check it out.

1382
01:37:29,454 --> 01:37:29,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1383
01:37:29,814 --> 01:37:32,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never played it, so we'll be interested.

1384
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:34,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to make it this time.

1385
01:37:34,176 --> 01:37:34,896
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I don't know.

1386
01:37:34,956 --> 01:37:38,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to have someone hold my hand here as far as setting up games and stuff because I have no fucking clue.

1387
01:37:39,017 --> 01:37:40,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I've never, ever played the game.

1388
01:37:40,918 --> 01:37:42,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk to Actdeft.

1389
01:37:42,038 --> 01:37:43,019
[SPEAKER_06]: He's pretty seasoned in the game.

1390
01:37:43,059 --> 01:37:44,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he can host or something.

1391
01:37:44,219 --> 01:37:45,179
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on the fog list.

1392
01:37:45,219 --> 01:37:46,040
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll do that.

1393
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:55,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was still thinking maybe I actually might move it to Friday nights going forward because I think it's easier for people to stay up later, especially on the East Coast because it's weekend.

1394
01:37:57,984 --> 01:38:03,865
[SPEAKER_06]: and maybe not this week but I have all the stuff to start recording so we'll be streaming that hopefully soon.

1395
01:38:03,965 --> 01:38:08,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, if you guys are doing Team Fortress 2, I should be able to stream that tomorrow on the Orange Lounge Radio channel.

1396
01:38:08,346 --> 01:38:08,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's PC.

1397
01:38:08,907 --> 01:38:10,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I can stream on PC so that'll be fun.

1398
01:38:11,067 --> 01:38:11,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, cool.

1399
01:38:11,827 --> 01:38:13,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, I guess that's going to do it.

1400
01:38:13,608 --> 01:38:15,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys very much for supporting independent podcasting.

1401
01:38:15,788 --> 01:38:17,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this wasn't one of our regular shows.

1402
01:38:17,969 --> 01:38:24,871
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura wasn't here for one and we didn't do our regular segments but if you enjoyed our little banter and you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show because there's plenty more

1403
01:38:25,231 --> 01:38:28,732
[SPEAKER_05]: and more to come.

1404
01:38:29,733 --> 01:38:41,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Your word of mouth and helping to spread word of the show is what keeps us afloat because we don't have the resources to raise thousands and thousands of dollars to promote and buy ads and so forth.

1405
01:38:41,837 --> 01:38:43,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys very much for supporting the show.

1406
01:38:43,878 --> 01:38:46,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave us a nice word on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or whatever.

1407
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:51,325
[SPEAKER_05]: and thanks for listening to us talk about Xbox One for a little while.

1408
01:38:51,585 --> 01:38:52,726
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to hear your voices too.

1409
01:38:52,766 --> 01:38:55,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget the mailbag, Twitter, Facebook and all that good stuff.

1410
01:38:55,891 --> 01:38:59,696
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see you back here on June 2nd, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern for another live show.

1411
01:38:59,996 --> 01:39:00,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great night everybody.

1412
01:39:01,097 --> 01:39:01,338
[SPEAKER_05]: See ya.

1413
01:39:02,108 --> 01:39:05,130
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1414
01:39:05,751 --> 01:39:09,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

1415
01:39:10,574 --> 01:39:19,460
[SPEAKER_01]: To join us for a live show, tune in to vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

1416
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:31,508
[SPEAKER_01]: The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

1417
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:33,469
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week!
