14407	21582	Tonight, May 23, 2013, on this special edition of the show, we sit down to talk all about the Xbox One.
42031	62227	Singular sensation, every little step she takes One thrilling combination, every move that she makes One smile and suddenly nobody else will do You know you'll never be lonely with you, no clue
70543	74685	Hi everybody, welcome to a special edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
75185	82808	Live on a special May 23rd, 2013 to celebrate the Xbox One.
83669	85850	Which of course was announced earlier this week.
86810	88231	My name of course is Rob Roberts.
88831	90532	Not joining us tonight, DarkSakura.
90712	94513	If you were listening last week, you know she's on a family trip and we didn't want to bother her while she's on her family trip.
94874	97835	She'll be back to lend her commentary on the next episode of OLR.
98095	100456	But in studio tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki!
100636	103098	I feel that we're celebrating this really like 12 years late.
105039	106260	Oh, the Xbox One?
106380	107840	Yeah, so be it.
108521	110682	Alright, so let's get down to it.
111983	118967	First off, it's a special episode of the show, obviously, because we are not going to be here on Sunday over the Memorial Day weekend.
119007	125110	So first off, for those of you guys here in the States that have Memorial Day weekend, we hope you have a happy and safe weekend.
125370	127771	And of course, let's not forget what the weekend is about.
127971	137796	So props to everybody that currently serves in the military, who has served in the military in the past, and who has protected our freedoms.
138136	145140	Props to you, military personnel overseas that will not be able to play the Xbox One because it is requiring a 24-hour...
145740	148222	Once every 24 hours, call home.
148302	150163	You're going to start already, aren't you?
150263	150523	All right.
151084	156247	So we're assuming if you've listened to this show, you're probably familiar enough with what's going on.
156307	159609	We don't have to regurgitate everything and treat it like it's all new news to you.
160730	162191	But we'll kind of touch on some of the points.
162792	167054	Of course, we are live Thursday night, so we have a little bit of a smaller turnout in chat than usual.
167375	170817	But those of you guys that are in our chat room, please feel free to comment along as usual.
171197	173759	Live.vognetwork.com.
175880	179943	And of course, I think we will take calls a little later on just depending on how late we run.
179964	182265	We don't want to run too late tonight because it's a school night.
182606	184927	But we might try to get some calls in a little later.
185548	187790	Thanks to you guys, by the way, for staying up very late on the East Coast.
188510	191413	8.30 was the earliest we could do it with all the weekday schedules and so forth.
191473	192634	So, yeah.
193354	200499	Alright, so, first off, they get up on stage, they do their little announcement thing, and the name is revealed.
200879	204582	It's not Infinity, it's not Lube, it's not anything else we've talked.
204642	205102	Fusion.
205563	209385	It's Xbox One, which, props to them for keeping it a secret.
210726	212768	But, you know, well, it's interesting.
213128	221033	I got to watch the thing a little bit afterwards because I was coming home from Reno that day that it was announced.
221874	226336	And so, you know, I heard everything that was going on on the internet and I heard all the news and everything.
226877	229118	But I wanted to sit down and watch the press conference for myself.
229559	234262	But knowing the name already, when I sat down and watched it, there was a lot of clues leading up to it.
234342	235903	Because even in like the opening...
236263	236984	Wink, wink I don't know
249065	250926	I have no problem with the name.
250946	251186	Whatever.
251206	252307	You can call it whatever you want.
252407	258570	It's not as dumb as Wii.
259190	268355	I wish that they would... I understand what they're trying to say with it, but at the same time, you're confusing people.
269076	276720	You're going to confuse some people because when you name a console basically after a generation previous...
278411	279193	It's going to confuse people.
279213	282578	It's just like people got confused with the Wii U. They thought it was the Wii.
282859	284441	Oh, why do I want Xbox One?
285022	286224	I want the new one, the 360.
286264	286364	What?
288730	292671	So you think there's a lot of people out there that are that slow to the pickup?
293412	295632	I don't know about that, but I think they're going to get confused.
295733	302135	I mean, there's going to be some confusion because, I mean, obviously people thought that the Wii U was just an extension of the Wii.
302715	309557	I mean, if they're going to make that mistake, then I guess that they can make the mistake that this is a completely, you know, that it's old.
309797	310217	I don't know.
310338	311598	It's just kind of a weird name.
312318	313659	I'm okay with the name.
313699	316281	It's not my favorite, but I don't absolutely hate it.
316701	323266	But I do find it very strange that somebody didn't think of the fact that everybody today writes XB360.
323646	326548	So maybe they're thinking everybody's going to put XB in the number one.
326848	330151	But if you actually write it out, XB1, you have Xbone.
331111	331652	Um, perhaps.
331672	332172	It's just...
357367	357687	I don't know.
357727	358548	It's kind of silly.
359668	368192	Some comments in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com DungeonBuster says, I thought I saw a tweet where someone wanted to pre-order an Xbox One and the GameStop employee said they don't sell those anymore.
370493	371353	I saw that same tweet.
373134	373494	Let's see.
374254	378496	DarkTetsuya says, Indeed, at least with PlayStation 4, people are like, oh, it's the new one.
379692	383653	Sony just kind of, you know, they took the easy way out, but it really works, right?
384813	385873	Sony's thing is works.
386013	389974	Well, I thought the whole idea with calling it the 360 was kind of weird in the first place.
390054	392974	I mean, it's just... Well, but I got it then.
392994	397735	We're used to it now, but it's just kind of like, I don't know.
397855	403516	You tried going the different direction, and so now you're going back to the way you were, so you made a full 360.
403656	405997	We were going back to a classic time for the Xbox.
406017	406457	Sorry about that.
406937	407437	Live radio.
407917	408337	Gotta love it.
409157	414720	Um, let's see, uh, SSJ100Matt says, I don't even think GameStop sells old Xboxes anymore.
414780	415260	No, that's true.
416020	418922	Um, BlackWolf says, X-Bone for the Call of Duty dog.
419762	420903	That could be the name of the dog.
421703	425365	Uh, BlackWolf continues on, if the name didn't kill the Wii, the name won't kill the X-Bone.
425565	426585	I agree, it won't.
427326	428286	It is, it's just, you know.
428886	429507	Interesting.
430647	434370	Alright, so first things first, they get out there and they're talking.
434710	442457	Television, you can watch The Price is Right and you can do this thing with your hands with the Kinect where you make it bigger, make it smaller.
443137	446600	Xbox, go to Star Wars or whatever, no, Star Trek.
446620	453505	Well, the very first thing they show, they show that you can sign on using your voice and it would recognize you.
453545	457609	Kind of like what it's supposed to do on the Xbox 360, which doesn't work too well.
457709	458029	It doesn't.
458990	463072	I hate to be pessimistic, but it constantly confuses me for Alan.
463673	472399	We don't sound that much alike, and just because we both have facial hair beards doesn't mean... But I understand tech's a lot better now, so whatever.
472919	487889	And then they showed him navigating the interface using swipes of the hand and stuff, and then they have this thing where you can basically dock stuff to the side of the screen like you can on Windows 8, or I think even Windows 7 you can do that stuff.
488592	491988	and so now you can Skype with people while you're watching a movie.
494011	508455	Well, I actually find that feature to be one of the more interesting features because I remember when Netflix used to be – well, it's still on 360, but it used to have that party mode where you could actually have everybody on the headset and kind of like talk during a movie.
508675	511776	There was a lot of people that were really into that and were kind of pissed when it disappeared.
511836	515337	And I don't even think to today we really fully understand why that disappeared.
515357	516757	It was probably that –
520118	521519	It's something we're going to get into later on.
521579	523800	So party chat, not okay.
523880	525741	But Skyping, okay.
525881	530683	Although I would think maybe you can't Skype during Netflix because that might be too much bandwidth.
530923	531403	I don't know.
531763	532444	Probably still can.
532524	534584	You could probably do at least Skyping while watching a movie.
534604	537526	But does that mean you can be synced up with the other... Did they get into that?
537566	537866	That you...
538526	543951	and your friend overseas can be watching the exact same thing synced up at the same moment.
544131	544612	I don't know about that.
544632	548215	I thought they had touched on that a little bit, that they could watch the movie together or whatever.
548235	549256	I thought they said that.
549456	549857	I don't know.
551038	551778	But here's the thing.
551838	556723	They were showing you bring up Internet Explorer in the side and then you navigate it using your phone.
558704	573074	or I could just go on my phone and use the browser on there instead of having to launch the app for Xbox Smart Glass and use that as... It's unnecessary.
573214	573815	It really is.
574475	581282	See, I'm going to be honest, though, and this is just me and my preferences, is that I don't really watch a lot of TV.
581682	582223	No, me neither.
582243	585666	So when I look at features like that, I'm kind of, meh.
586227	593214	I've been catching up on a few things on Netflix, but live TV, there's very little that I watch anymore.
593614	594415	Very, very rare.
595015	605041	Now, I admit, being able to have a Skype party during RuPaul's Drag Race sounds really exciting, but, I mean, I don't know if it's something I would get a lot of use out of.
605722	606542	You could do that right now.
606562	607423	That's true, that's true.
607963	608823	I mean, it's just...
610685	615572	It's a neat idea, but I don't think it's something that people are going to use a lot.
615632	618896	It's just like, hey, look, Twitter and Facebook are part of Xbox.
620518	621519	Fuck, did anyone use that?
621720	622080	No.
623101	623262	Once.
623522	625645	Hey, look how I'm tweeting from my Xbox.
626045	626426	Done.
626766	627587	I mean, that was it.
628308	632190	E3 is like in a couple weeks Not a shocker there 15 games
655922	681589	and E3 apparently which is that's not bad how many of them are going to get delayed but well in 15 years and also on top of that 15 games not necessarily retail releases because now they're considering Xbox Live Arcade and indie games games they're just calling everything games now to make it even harder to find shit I don't know but
683089	685010	I wasn't that disappointed they didn't show anything.
685030	688352	In fact, the one new property they showed from, was it Remedy or whatever?
688372	689113	Yeah, that one.
689173	690334	It made no fucking sense.
690474	696597	They could have just shown nothing and said, hey, new game from Remedy, and people would have been like, oh, sweet.
696617	697838	It's Quantum Break is the name of it.
697858	699219	Quantum Break, yeah, okay.
699859	703202	I don't really need, you know, I don't know.
703982	704542	It looked weird.
706124	711653	I thought it was interesting that it mixed the live action with kind of a throwback to PC CD-ROM.
712054	713977	I don't think that that's actually gameplay.
713997	715079	I think that's just the trailer.
715480	717403	I don't think it was actually part of it.
718311	720633	Yeah, but I was okay.
720713	723595	I liked Alan Wake a lot.
723635	725896	I think it was really underrated by a lot of people.
726336	729138	By the way, the weekly deal on Humble Bundle.
729298	730159	Yeah, seriously.
730179	733381	If you've never played Alan Wake or you don't own it, you need to get in on this Humble Bundle.
733501	734282	Just tangent.
735142	735402	Great.
735783	743608	Anyway, our chat room is lighting up, of course, as you would think for a topic that's been as hot-buttoned in the gaming community as the Xbox One.
744429	769131	TigerClaw says the one good thing about this conference was that Microsoft actually showed the console unlike Sony who just talked about it well that seems to have been a mixed bag for them and let's talk about the look for a little bit you know the consoles look a lot of people on Twitter I'm seeing going this thing looks like a Betamax VCR it's kind of dumpy who cares yeah I I have to I'm kind of with you like I think people put way too much stock on
769751	770891	in what the box looks like.
770911	771792	What's your PC look like?
772112	772912	Oh, is that sexy?
772952	773712	No, it's a box.
773772	774373	Who cares?
774433	777054	Well, some people go all out on the cases and the lights and the smoke.
777074	777874	Okay, I understand that.
777954	778854	You can still do that.
779034	781095	You can still add smoke lights and whatever.
781115	783496	You can put My Little Pony stickers all over the Xbox if you want.
783536	784956	I don't really care.
785136	787637	I mean, who cares if the case is all nice and rounded?
787657	788838	You know what a rounded case means?
788978	790618	I can't fucking stand it up on its end.
790898	794960	Now, granted, this thing is like the size of a VCR, so you probably don't want to stack that thing on its end, but...
795600	796221	Who cares?
796442	798726	As long as it's well-ventilated, I don't care.
798846	803756	I'll tell you what was exciting about the way it looks and what have you, which, you know, I'm not...
804713	806374	I like that they went minimalist with it.
806634	807274	I'll give them that.
807394	809635	You know, it's a very minimalist look, and I think that's fine.
810016	814598	If the thing is just going to sit on your shelf, you know, it doesn't need to be flashy.
814618	824022	They showed, like, when they were making it and stuff, they're like, okay, here's the system, here's the drive, here's the chip, here's that fucking huge-ass heat sink and a giant goddamn fan on top of it.
824222	830005	This shit will not over... Oh, and by the way, half of the console is a vent, and the other half is more vents.
831005	832406	It's like, I don't think it's going to be a problem.
832546	836130	Yeah, and actually, the thing that excited me most that they said about it was that it's silent.
836670	837491	Yay!
837511	838532	Or pretty close to it, yeah.
838552	846361	Because the old 360s, oh my gosh, those things are, like, I still have one of the earlier model 360s, and that thing's, it still sounds like a freight truck when you turn it on.
846381	848042	Like, it's really loud and noticeable.
848423	850385	So, to me, that was the most exciting part.
850445	855070	I don't care what it looks like, just shut the hell up when I'm trying to watch a movie, right?
856833	861158	Dungeon Buster in chat says, I'm just hoping it doesn't have the same hardware issues the 360 did early on.
861178	861519	It's not.
861559	864922	I mean, we're talking like how many advancements in chips have there been?
865003	873392	It's running such a, you know, like a, was it a 28, it was a 28 watt chip or 28 nanometer chip now?
873492	875695	I mean, they're really low wattage chips now.
876195	880976	I'm a valid concern, in my opinion, with how bad that Red Ring affected people.
881076	885437	And not just that, but there's been a lot of tiny little stumbles along the way for Microsoft.
885457	897080	I'm not trying to just pee all over them or whatever, but the reality is Xbox Live got broken into somehow and a ton of people had money stolen, including me, with their live accounts or whatever.
898121	901741	I personally had two Xboxes that Red Ring and had to be sent back.
901801	903542	There was those issues.
903742	903822	And
904182	904742	I understand.
904802	905503	Sony has issues.
905543	906463	Nintendo has issues too.
907083	908964	I haven't personally experienced any of them.
909004	910545	Those consoles still run like rocks.
910585	913026	My PlayStation 2 is still flawless pretty much.
914887	916447	I think it's a valid concern.
916787	928773	Now, I'm optimistic that Microsoft's learned and so forth and I don't think we need to necessarily hold the past against them, but I understand where the concern comes from.
929153	929733	It's been a while.
933075	934416	I did like the new controller.
934556	935937	Yeah, I was going to get into that next.
935957	936477	The controller.
936597	937858	What did you think?
937978	942241	I liked the idea of having actual rumble in the triggers.
942261	944502	I think that's kind of a neat innovation, I guess.
944782	947804	It looks like they fixed the D-pad, so that's good.
948124	948585	Thank God.
948745	950066	Everything else is pretty much the same.
950526	956990	Battery compartments integrated inside the controller, which at first I was like, oh, sweet, built-in battery like the PlayStation 3.
958371	962252	But no, no, it's actually it's, you know, compartment where you can put double A batteries and stuff.
962272	963753	So I'm a little disappointed about that.
963853	968174	But because those batteries die so fast, I just was hoping that would be more integrated.
968534	970274	But maybe to keep the cost down or something.
970374	970875	Maybe.
971255	975236	Yeah, you would think that they would kind of have taken the charge idea from the PlayStation 3.
975516	977556	I mean, it's so freaking convenient with a mini USB.
977616	978877	It's it's I love that.
979457	983241	Yeah, so that's a little disappointing, but I mean, it looks nice.
983742	987746	I don't have a problem with, you know, how it's, you know, it's a little bit bigger now, but whatever.
987906	989307	Yeah, it's not that big a deal.
992391	996875	Now, I did not remember hearing this when I was watching the press conference.
996895	999979	This is one of those things that came out after the press conference is a lot did.
1000959	1001760	But what's this whole thing?
1001780	1003501	It's supposed to measure your vitality?
1003661	1005722	Like the Wii Vitality Sensor, the heartbeat thing?
1006283	1009004	No, the Kinect sensor can do that because it's that sensitive.
1009384	1014367	Because it can actually see your heart rate based on your veins pulsing on your face.
1014407	1015468	Yeah, it's that detailed now.
1015488	1020431	That's... well... The skeptic in me is wondering about that.
1020451	1026254	Because, you know, I thought this first Kinect was supposed to do so much and be so accurate.
1026354	1027115	That Kinect sucks.
1027915	1028856	I'm selling mine, by the way.
1029577	1030798	I'm getting rid of mine right now.
1030818	1032359	Yeah, but I'm just kind of like, I don't know.
1032379	1035662	There's a skeptic in me that's like, I like to play video games in the dark.
1035782	1038164	It's going to see my heartbeat in the dark?
1038184	1038744	It's infrared.
1039845	1040726	It can still see all?
1040746	1042047	That's crazy.
1042107	1044409	It's infrared, and remember, now they have the new technology.
1044429	1049973	It was a time of flight with the photons where it measures the actual distance and stuff like that.
1051555	1055880	I think that's all great and stuff, but I don't like what they're doing with it.
1056121	1060626	And a lot of this tinfoil hat stuff starts making me wonder because think about it.
1060646	1063369	They have this new technology now that's the time of flight stuff.
1063409	1067474	So it's going to look at, you know, it's not going to just recognize you based on a picture.
1067494	1070318	It's recognizing you based on like a 3D image of yourself.
1070858	1082088	So, and remember they patented something a while ago where it was going to be able to enforce, like, was it the public screening things of movies or whatever?
1082108	1089134	So if you had a bunch of people in your house and you're watching a movie and it's like, ah, nope, sorry, too many people watching this movie at the same time type thing, you know?
1089594	1091235	No, they would not do that.
1091255	1092316	They have a patent for it.
1092416	1093818	Why would you get a patent for that?
1093858	1097581	I'm just saying, it's not necessarily something they will implement, but...
1098261	1103165	And then also I worry too that, say for example, you're sharing your login with a friend or something like that.
1103245	1105367	Hey, you can log in on my account and play my game.
1105587	1106608	It's going to look at your face.
1106868	1108390	I'm sorry, you don't look like that person.
1108770	1110051	Sorry, not going to let you log in.
1111052	1115776	I'm worried that they're going to try to do that, lock it down somehow.
1115796	1117958	But people change.
1118918	1120299	What if I want to shave my beard off?
1120319	1122181	It's not going to look at your beard.
1122241	1125264	It's probably going to look at proportions, like proportions between your eyes.
1125664	1126905	What if I lose a ton of weight?
1128163	1128563	I don't know.
1128783	1129783	I don't know how it's going to work.
1130023	1132124	Or gain a ton of weight the way I'm going.
1132804	1149888	I'm just saying that I'm very worst case scenario with them because I don't, especially after the whole rumor, and I don't even know what's going on with this now because everyone's contradicting everyone else about the whole not playing used games.
1150168	1151009	Well, not necessarily.
1151209	1152549	It's plays used games, okay?
1152889	1156450	Basically, all the games that you play have to be installed with hard drive.
1156610	1156790	Fine?
1157170	1157810	EA Sports Partnership Don't care
1188041	1189722	Well, they are going to be big sellers.
1190223	1194546	It was interesting to see EA get out there on stage and pledge their full support to Xbox.
1194746	1204293	I think I said something on the last show about that, too, where they did that for Wii U and then totally just turned around and went to go to bed with their new buddy, Microsoft.
1204313	1206795	It was just kind of funny the way that all played out.
1206995	1211158	Which only made the news after the show more, yeah, we kind of figured that was going to happen.
1211278	1211739	Yeah.
1212639	1237534	uh and then um Call of Duty Ghosts which I'm not so big on that series but you are so what'd you think I didn't really understand like it didn't really make any sense to me it wasn't like no I mean honestly it's like you know Black Ops 2 looked pretty awesome with all the drones and stuff and that kind of you know that was something that made me kind of excited about the game this one doesn't really other than okay stuff's kind of post-apocalyptic a little bit and there's a dog
1238484	1240927	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1259945	1260325	I don't know.
1260485	1262506	I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.
1262666	1264326	And they're going to fucking kill the thing off.
1264386	1265947	You know they're going to kill the dog off.
1265987	1267508	They always kill the dog off.
1267588	1271830	If it's not this game, it's going to be in a game or two next.
1271870	1272970	They're going to kill that dog.
1273670	1275011	Something's going to happen to that dog.
1275051	1276251	That dog is not long for this world.
1276271	1276972	Save the dog.
1277152	1278352	Hashtag save the dog.
1279293	1279613	All right.
1281814	1282294	Let's see.
1284278	1290583	One of the other big things I wanted to bring up that they talked about on stage was the Halo TV series So now it's no longer a movie we're talking about, it's a TV series we're talking about
1312173	1325887	So, Steven Spielberg, executive producing They had that gal on stage that used to be with CBS and all that I remember hearing that they had hired her and she was going to be working with the Xbox content delivery
1326756	1330199	I was surprised we actually didn't hear more about that whole thing.
1330239	1332401	And I'm not necessarily talking about the Halo TV show.
1333201	1338505	In talking with some people, it seemed a little unclear at first.
1338626	1341007	Is this something that's going to be on TV?
1341127	1342869	Is this something that's going to be a Netflix Hulu thing?
1343229	1352160	But I think, you know, going back and watching it later when I did, it seemed pretty clear to me that they are going to launch some type of video-on-demand service.
1352561	1358148	Which, well, I mean, they already have a video-on-demand service, but Xbox original programming or something is going to be built into that.
1358468	1360571	And this Halo would obviously be a huge...
1362333	1364235	staple in that, you know, with Steven Spielberg's name on it.
1364255	1374822	Especially, Steven Spielberg, his, like, TV series, especially the ones that have been on, like, I think he had some on Showtime or HBO or something like that, like, The Band of Brothers, I think, was one of his, are really good.
1374982	1387972	I mean, they're really good war dramas, so, I mean, assuming that it's, you know, treated nice, like, maybe not so much like that, was it the, what the fuck was that
1388809	1389669	Forward Unto Dawn.
1389709	1391090	Forward Unto Dawn was kind of cheesy.
1391570	1394932	But, you know, assuming it's better than that, I think it could be pretty awesome.
1396132	1396893	Am I going to watch it?
1397193	1397613	Probably not.
1397993	1399834	What if you have to pay for it, though?
1400414	1401695	Nope, definitely not going to watch it then.
1402695	1402895	Huh.
1403435	1405296	I just, I'm not a huge fan of Halo.
1405516	1408498	I just, I'm not going to seek out this TV show.
1408758	1409778	It doesn't really appeal to me.
1412159	1416341	It's neat, though, that they're, you know, they're going to talk about doing something like that.
1416441	1418222	What else might they be working on, you think?
1420788	1424950	Maybe some more Xbox-centric news shows.
1425050	1430453	Remember they used to have a bunch of their community blog stuff on there.
1430833	1432674	I think they even had something with Major Nelson.
1432714	1436356	I don't know if that's still there or not.
1436776	1437916	Maybe something like that.
1439177	1442079	I'm not really sure if they would have any more TV shows based on their properties.
1442959	1444220	I don't think I'd want to watch another...
1445440	1450702	Maybe if we do a Steven Spielberg Halo thing, we can do a Michael Bay Gears of War or something.
1452363	1453543	Or a Michael Bay Crackdown.
1453583	1454063	That would be awesome.
1454243	1456384	Is this something to enhance Xbox Live, possibly?
1457244	1460946	This will just be, if you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber, it's a free thing for you.
1461346	1461566	Maybe.
1461906	1462106	Maybe.
1465050	1470979	By the way, not to get derailed by this, but yes, there was just a 5.9 earthquake up by Susanville, which is a ways away.
1470999	1473283	That's like, you know, three hours north.
1473924	1474745	But I guess they're feeling it.
1474845	1475626	I didn't feel it.
1476408	1477069	What's up with that?
1478587	1478887	Weird.
1480348	1480669	All right.
1481189	1483170	Thanks for derailing the show, Earthquake.
1483210	1484111	What are you trying to say?
1485092	1485592	Oh, man.
1485712	1487093	Don't do a show on Thursdays.
1488274	1492037	Okay, so did that pretty much cover everything, at least from the press conference itself?
1492257	1492717	I think so.
1492737	1499442	Yeah, and then, of course, they said, you know, was it 15 games or something?
1499923	1503145	Yeah, which we mentioned a little bit ago, which, you know, more to come at E3.
1503325	1503525	Yeah.
1503765	1503885	So...
1506545	1507105	I'm not surprised.
1529156	1538228	and it will however be cross or backwards compatible if you will with any videos that you've bought, music that you've bought and so on.
1538969	1545437	Obviously this ties into the fact that the Xbox One is using a new chipset which the PlayStation 4 is doing the same thing.
1546198	1551101	Although on the PlayStation 4 side, you kind of go, well, use the Gaikai thing to make some magic happen.
1551601	1558445	They're going to offer that later on, but it's not going to be like, hey, you bought this title, now you get this game free.
1558525	1559526	I don't think it's going to be like that.
1559866	1560647	It would be nice.
1561227	1563109	It's not going to happen that way, but it would be nice.
1563429	1570736	So there will be no backwards compatibility, which, you know, I realize that most of the, you know, PlayStation 3 wasn't backwards compatible.
1571216	1573778	Xbox 360 had limited backwards compatibility.
1573798	1579243	Well, PlayStation 3 originally started backwards compatible, but, you know, then it slowly went away.
1579624	1580545	Yeah, that's true.
1580765	1584188	It's harder to create a system with, you know, you can't...
1584488	1585168	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1601115	1604836	I'm kind of with you because PlayStation 4 is in the same boat.
1605456	1607777	So it's not like one does it and the other doesn't.
1608437	1620480	But I just think the thing to be concerned about is that, again, this year, at the end of the year, when these consoles are launching, you still have a lot of good stuff coming out for the current gen.
1620760	1623661	And people that buy that stuff aren't going to be able to play it on the new consoles.
1623681	1624481	And here's the thing, too.
1624501	1624702	Yeah.
1626582	1654443	you know don't think that you have to buy one of these new consoles right at launch I mean I kind of want to but I'm not really forcing myself to do that because once again any of these games that I want to play like say you know Grand Theft Auto 5 only on you know the current gen stuff you know but other stuff like Assassin's Creed 4, Battlefield 4, Call of Duty you know all that stuff is going to be also on current gen or even if you want to go further Destiny you
1655063	1656824	is going to be on current gen as well.
1657924	1659685	Was it Watch Dogs current gen?
1659785	1664947	So I don't need to buy a new console to play these awesome games.
1665287	1666228	I can just wait.
1666428	1675072	And let's be honest, the new consoles that come out that have these games on them and then also have them on the current gen, they're not going to be that drastically different.
1675392	1680214	I mean, hell, they've shown gameplay from like the PlayStation 4 of Assassin's Creed 4.
1680354	1682735	I can't tell the difference between that and the PS3 version.
1683175	1684516	Apparently there's some better physics.
1684996	1686016	I can't tell the difference.
1686356	1687437	So I don't know.
1688337	1691998	And let's assume, you know, these games are still coming out at $60.
1692038	1697721	So are they going to price the PlayStation 4 and, you know, Xbox One games the same thing?
1698241	1698941	I don't think so.
1699621	1701162	I'd be surprised if they're the same price.
1701522	1702843	If anything, I think they're going to be like $69.
1704542	1710708	Although, I have been receiving some temporary pricing from Ubisoft.
1711348	1713270	It shows $99, but there's no way.
1714911	1721157	I have a feeling the MSRP for games, I think that maybe hasn't been determined yet.
1721537	1722197	I don't think so either.
1739107	1763542	very slippery slope if they were to bump it up to $69.99 they're already talking about Battlefield 4 they already announced the pre-order DLC campaign that's going to be added on already and the comment is like why don't you just include that in the regular game then if you're already announcing this and it's already being worked on why is this not being included in the game well
1765783	1775230	Okay, then the biggie, and this is the one that everybody's talking about, and I'm not even sure I can make sense of what the hell is happening with this news.
1775650	1790221	Microsoft's not giving a clear answer on it, and they pretty much have said that they won't until E3, and I think this whole thing started with a post, and surprise that this came from Kotaku that started a crazy wave over the internet.
1790241	1791242	No, it wasn't Kotaku.
1792063	1796287	Well, I'm thinking of that interview that they had with Phil Harrison, right?
1796848	1805797	It started with Wired Magazine got the exclusive interview or whatever with Microsoft about their Xbox One console.
1805817	1810482	They were the first to have everything, and then it kind of spun off from their people asking follow-up questions about that.
1810782	1810963	Okay.
1811563	1822509	So they first, it talked about how the console will play used games, but will require you to pay a fee in order to use that disc a second time.
1824130	1826391	So that, it just...
1827179	1838168	Okay, first off, I don't know even if this is going to happen because they keep going back on it and, you know, the Xbox support Twitter saying no, it's completely wrong.
1838188	1839789	We're trying to get them to remove that story.
1839869	1840830	It's completely inaccurate.
1840850	1842771	Yeah, quote from the Xbox support account.
1842952	1848216	I understand your concerns, but can confirm that any information for fees for used games is incorrect.
1850403	1858346	I don't know if in a lot of these people asking the same question to these guys, they're phrasing it in a very careful way.
1859206	1866009	When they're asking about, can I go to my friend's house and play my copy of a game?
1866109	1869570	They're like, yes, you can go to your friend's house and play your copy of the game.
1870350	1874271	You can install it to their drive, but you have to log into your account to do that.
1874411	1875852	You can't just loan them the game.
1876432	1883396	So what's happening right now is basically it sounds like every game is going to have a code that comes with it, kind of like the online pass.
1883856	1888298	Basically that code is going to lock that game to your system.
1888419	1894562	So you install it, you give them the authentication code, and then you can play the game without the disc anymore.
1894602	1896103	The disc is basically, you don't need it.
1897123	1901168	Now, what they haven't explained is what happens when you give that disc to your friend and they don't have a code.
1901869	1905513	Now, originally they said, okay, you're going to have to pay full price.
1905553	1911680	And this is coming from an interview from higher ups saying this, that you're going to have to pay the full price of the game to play it on your system.
1911740	1915885	Now, I took that as, you're going to have to pay the full price to play that game on your system without a disc.
1916445	1922468	I don't understand why they can't do it, you know, okay, you can play the game off the disc.
1922528	1930131	But I understand why they're doing that is because, you know, I could buy it, load it on my system, play without a disc, give it to my friend, he plays with the disc, you get two games for the price.
1930331	1930832	One, basically.
1930872	1931792	So they can't do it that way.
1931812	1936174	And I think I'm hearing something about the installation is being done because Blu-ray drives are too slow.
1937902	1939302	Yes and no.
1939402	1943023	I mean, yes, I understand that they're... But that's fine.
1943123	1944204	Forced installation is fine.
1944604	1946324	Then why do we need the one-time use code?
1948465	1949485	That's DRM.
1949645	1950185	That's all it is.
1950265	1950845	It's DRM.
1950885	1956387	It's not... I understand the drive's slow and that you can force that, but you know what?
1957247	1957367	Um...
1957947	1959308	Right now, I have my Xbox 360.
1959608	1962970	I install games to the hard drive, and the disk's in the drive.
1963190	1966952	It reads the disk for a little bit to authenticate that you have the disk, and it runs it off the hard drive.
1967233	1968393	Why can't we do it the same way?
1968694	1970134	I don't understand why we can't do it the same way.
1970715	1971755	Because they want DRM.
1972336	1973877	They want the DRM in there because there's...
1974677	1975718	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1996152	1998294	I got to put a code in now that, you know, play my game.
1998855	2002358	And see what they haven't explained right now is that how are you going to revoke that?
2002959	2004861	They said they're supporting used games, okay?
2005682	2009626	Let's pretend that this is actually a one-time used code like it is with the online passes.
2010066	2017554	Then when I sell it to GameStop, as this current scenario is right, as they're explaining right now, granted this is going to change in a drop of a dime,
2018895	2020136	I sell this back to GameStop.
2020936	2022437	Why are they going to buy it from me first off?
2022477	2025438	Because if anybody takes that game and tries to install it, it's going to ask them for $60.
2025978	2033142	So you're essentially killing used games even though you can pass it off to a friend and they can install it for the full price.
2033682	2039945	So there's got to be something in the way of where you can revoke your license or whatever on that.
2040225	2050588	But once again, that's going to require that code because unless there's a code somehow on that disk, and I don't know how that would even be accomplished because I don't even know.
2050688	2057590	It doesn't even make sense how that would even be accomplished unless there's like some RFID tag or something like that, which can be faked.
2057730	2058471	You could fake that.
2059571	2064297	If it is tied to that code, and I lose that code, then how... Is that disk useless now?
2064337	2066600	I can't use that disk because I don't have the code to install it?
2066660	2068021	I don't understand how it's going to work.
2068342	2075150	I want to go back to something that was said through an official channel, and this was on majornelson.com, and he's kind of the mouthpiece for Microsoft.
2075810	2100232	and during all this you know craziness about the used games he released a statement on his blog that says quote we know there is some confusion around used games on Xbox One and wanted to provide a bit of clarification on exactly what we've confirmed today while there have been many potential scenarios discussed today we have only confirmed that we designed Xbox One to enable our customers to trade in and resell games at retail
2101113	2103714	So you will be able to use GameStop somehow in this.
2104454	2108715	Okay, yeah, I understand that they have it so that you can trade in your games and resell it.
2108755	2110376	But what if it's worthless?
2110616	2114457	I mean, hell, you can, you know, if it's... Yeah, but I don't think you say that if it's worthless.
2114517	2115817	Like, there's something there.
2115837	2119799	Yeah, so there's something there, but it doesn't make any sense that it has to be this complicated.
2119839	2120919	Make it as easily...
2121759	2123421	Why can't it be the same as it is now?
2123581	2125003	I don't understand why they have to do that.
2125163	2125544	Oh, I know.
2125684	2127526	It's because they got pressured by EA to do this.
2127726	2131010	How do you think they got their silly little EA partnership?
2131290	2133873	Oh, it's because they fucking implemented this shit.
2134013	2134494	Hold on, though.
2134534	2135895	Let me play Devil's Avenue for a minute.
2136096	2136196	Now...
2136856	2142220	Tim Tripp's in our chat and says, there are a lot of other really good reasons to play off a hard drive besides DRM.
2142760	2145922	And one thing I can think of, you know, you might... Hold on, hold on.
2146063	2156550	One thing I can think of is that on the 360, there have been problems when some people use the disk, some people install to the drive, and sometimes one is too slow, one is too fast.
2156850	2159832	You know, there were problems when people were installing certain games and so forth.
2160152	2162754	So this is kind of one way to level that playing field.
2162774	2162954	No, no, no.
2163054	2165035	I have no problem with installing to the hard drive.
2165135	2166036	I think that's a great idea.
2166116	2169818	I install all my games to the hard drive anyways because, yes, that drive is loud.
2170058	2170719	It's slow.
2171159	2171639	That's fine.
2171679	2172540	I have no problem with that.
2172620	2174121	I have a problem with the one-time use code.
2174221	2175501	That is my problem right there.
2175622	2176162	Yeah, but then how –
2176962	2177663	I can understand.
2177783	2178643	How do you stop?
2179063	2180924	You install it, and then I take it to my friends.
2180984	2181565	They install it.
2181585	2184626	It requires a disk in the drive, just like it is now.
2184706	2186067	It requires a disk in the drive.
2186187	2186587	There you go.
2186787	2189989	It just spins it, the check that's there, and that's it.
2190629	2192730	I don't understand why it has to be any more complicated than that.
2192790	2195012	They're making it complicated because they're fucking treating it.
2195032	2197133	Didn't you just say that somebody's worked around that system on 360?
2198072	2201015	Yeah, they've worked around it and they patched it.
2201195	2201955	But you know what?
2202676	2203557	It's a different story now.
2203597	2204477	We're talking a new console.
2204638	2207960	And not everybody is doing that.
2208201	2210362	We're talking about people that are pirating games.
2210783	2212564	A small minority are doing this.
2212985	2215447	And you're treating everybody like a pirate.
2216107	2224191	I'll agree with you to the extent that if a small minority figured out a way to work the system now, that same small minority is going to figure out a way to work the system then.
2224911	2228233	So I'll meet you to that point.
2230094	2232475	Let me read the rest of Major Nelson's statement.
2233055	2234976	Beyond that, we have not confirmed any specific scenarios.
2235216	2239018	Quote, another piece of clarification around playing games at a friend's house.
2239498	2244461	Should you choose to play your game at your friend's house, there is no fee to play that game.
2244861	2246682	while you are signed into your profile.
2247343	2249104	That was the end of the statement.
2249604	2251325	There's a lot there that's unsaid.
2251605	2253687	It's kind of like you read the inverse of that.
2253747	2261932	They're treating all games as a digital download, but whether you're digitally downloading it off the disc or downloading it off the internet.
2262492	2272119	The problem with that is I like that you want to treat it like this, and this is very idealistic of Microsoft to think this way, but that's not how the fucking world works.
2272799	2273640	and DarkSakura.com.
2294142	2297303	Some people like to have that equity where they know they can sell it later.
2297403	2303745	There are a lot of people that buy games full price and then sell them for whatever nickels and dimes they can get to get some of their money back when they beat it.
2303925	2304365	Exactly.
2304605	2305386	And here's my thing.
2306426	2310387	It's very idealistic of them to think that they can pull that off right now.
2310487	2310968	You know what?
2311288	2319310	Maybe you should wait another decade or so where the infrastructure is in place to where that actually is a thing where you can download games and it's very effortlessly.
2319911	2320111	But...
2321511	2322912	Right now, it's not there.
2323252	2326215	And you can't think that you can pull this off.
2326515	2329857	I'm sorry, you can't do this.
2330138	2331799	They're going to try to do this, but you know what?
2331859	2334021	If not everyone is on board, it's not going to work.
2334241	2338344	And if PlayStation 4 is on, and you better believe, PlayStation 4 is probably thinking the same thing.
2338724	2343207	We may have made this deal before, but we're not sure if we're going to do this.
2344348	2355636	I was reading this in chat earlier, and I apologize, I don't remember the specific names of the people saying this, but some people were talking about PlayStation 4, and could Sony actually have this exact same system in place, but they're letting Microsoft take the heat for it?
2357629	2358630	Don't get me wrong.
2358790	2363094	I think that both companies met together and agreed on something.
2363234	2366898	And I think EA started it, tinfoil hat, if you will.
2367458	2374024	EA wouldn't just drop it if one company was doing it.
2374425	2379609	They would say, okay, yeah, we're not doing it on the 360 or the Xbox, but we're going to do it on the PlayStation 4.
2380670	2384633	Um, so everybody's on board with this because that's the only way it's going to work.
2384653	2388016	They're not counting Nintendo because Nintendo doesn't, it's just, you know, whatever.
2388176	2389517	It doesn't even matter.
2390138	2393440	It's so small, it's, you know, it's no big deal to them.
2393480	2394761	So they're all on board with this.
2395042	2400126	However, I could see one of them or both of them backing out of it because of the backlash of it.
2401307	2409070	I have to go here now, and a lot of people in our chat room, starting with Slidekick, are going here too, is about, well, isn't this interesting now?
2410691	2418834	Let's say your little tinfoil hat locked boardroom scenario, EA sat Sony and Microsoft down to mutually agree on this or whatever.
2419114	2421615	Who has EA recently apparently turned their back on?
2421675	2422335	Nintendo.
2422695	2427817	Doesn't this put the Wii U in this really interesting situation now where none of this fuckery exists there?
2429258	2448531	And despite all this talk about, you know, where the Wii U is in this horrible place and da-da-da-da-da Suddenly, the Wii U has got the system we all want To be able to trade games and rent games No, here's the thing though, here's the thing It's like, you don't have to do any of this
2449960	2450380	Hello?
2450801	2452522	You don't have to buy any systems.
2452682	2454684	You don't have to pick one of the three consoles.
2455004	2457726	It's not like, make your choice, you know, and that's it.
2458006	2459027	You've got tons of choices.
2459047	2459728	You can go PC.
2459748	2465592	You can keep the consoles you have now because I'll bet you they're going to keep supporting those consoles if no one's buying the new ones.
2466333	2470757	And, you know, like I said, if you want to buy the Wii U, cool, buy the Wii U. But I don't think that all of a sudden...
2471517	2485441	For me, why would I buy a console that generates pretty much the same type of graphics as... There's nothing really to gain for me from the Wii U. But I'm just saying that you don't have to buy these new consoles.
2485481	2485941	That's the thing.
2486001	2487822	It's like, I don't have to put up with this bullshit.
2487842	2490682	You want to go ahead and try to implement all this stuff where I can't sell games?
2490882	2491243	Hey, you know what?
2491283	2493323	I can't sell games on Steam either, but here's the thing.
2493723	2495644	Steam drops the price of their games...
2496844	2497705	Very frequently.
2498005	2499426	And I get some really good deals.
2499586	2504990	And I buy games that if on console, you know, I probably wouldn't be picking up those games.
2505430	2517618	I can honestly say, you know, I get the Steam comparison and there's this little meme that's on Twitter that I saw somewhere that says, you know, Xbox One announces that new games are tied to one account.
2517698	2518659	Internet gets crazy.
2518999	2520440	Steam games are tied to one account.
2520540	2521601	Everybody loves Valve.
2521661	2522601	Heart, you type of thing.
2522661	2526404	And, you know, although I get the point there, I'm thinking back myself personally.
2527064	2532388	I have never bought a game on Steam for $60 that was digital distribution only.
2532908	2536070	I have bought PC games where I had the little disc in my hand for $60.
2536451	2541914	World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, whatever.
2542435	2548539	I've bought PC games that way, but I've never done digital distribution on a game that wasn't on a cheap sale.
2548779	2550740	And I've talked about this on an older OLR.
2551200	2554803	I said there's going to be... Again, this is all probably hysteria anyway.
2554823	2556504	We don't really fucking know what's happening.
2557224	2582289	but there's gotta be some give here if you're gonna tell people that their games are going to lose equity and you're not gonna have that same resale value then you need to make the price of a new game cheaper something's gotta give that's why people love Steam because Steam makes games a heck of a lot cheaper yeah exactly like I bought was it I've just bought a Sonic bundle with you know like 12 games in it for 20 bucks and
2583269	2585690	It's just, it's that cheap impulse buy.
2586071	2591894	You don't see Microsoft and, you know, Sony marking down their games by like 60% or something.
2592354	2593534	It's just not going to happen.
2593674	2597837	So what makes you think it's going to all of a sudden start happening when they lock everything?
2597857	2604320	You know, let's say we live in this perfect world now where we have the bandwidth to download these games digitally and they decide, hey, you know what?
2604580	2605320	This is the way we're going to go.
2605340	2606401	We're going to do everything digital.
2606441	2609683	Do you really think they're going to have the same type of sales as Steam does?
2609943	2610283	No.
2610303	2610343	No.
2610623	2611324	Of course not.
2611384	2620011	It's just like how on the PlayStation Network, how you can get PlayStation portable games that are more expensive on the digital store than they are at retail.
2621473	2630661	Osfer in chat says, I like the point someone made earlier that while we should be used to tied accounts on PC, that was something we didn't have to deal with for consoles, and it was nice.
2632683	2641671	Captain Spike says, not to prove EA right about Steam devaluing games, but aside the very rare new release once or twice a year, I don't buy anything on Steam that's more than like $20.
2641991	2645975	But do you hear those companies complaining?
2646195	2651360	Those companies have already made back their money a lot of times on these games, and now they're just dropping prices.
2651900	2652881	It's extra sales for them.
2652901	2654302	I mean, they're not printing discs.
2654763	2657225	It's just a digital copy.
2657505	2659367	It costs nothing for them to manufacture that.
2660468	2663130	I want to get to one more comment from Major Nelson's blog.
2663170	2670658	He did a chat with Yahoo, which, God, Yahoo is everywhere in the news all of a sudden, with the whole Tumblr and everything else they've been buying.
2670938	2677965	But anyway, Major Nelson was on Yahoo, and the very first question thrown at him in the Yahoo chat is about used games.
2678786	2683909	Larry, could you please provide some more clarity as to how users will be able to play used games on Xbox One?
2683989	2684689	Here's the response.
2685109	2690052	We are still months away from the launch of Xbox One, and policy decisions are still being finalized.
2690472	2698977	So, that being said, do we need to just sit down and fucking wait for E3 for more information to come out on this?
2699257	2701678	Is the internet going too crazy with this shit?
2702058	2702639	Thanks for watching!
2718954	2719455	Thank you for watching!
2738777	2748141	Well, you reminded me of one big thing they talked about at the press conference that we didn't talk about earlier, and that's the Azure Cloud, or Blue Cloud, Windows Blue, haha.
2748501	2749922	So they have the cloud, right?
2750182	2754563	And they're talking about that they can do processing on the cloud, and that's something you can do in games.
2754844	2757965	What is it, something like 300,000 servers functioning, da-da-da?
2758585	2762228	and of course this makes people think in their mind, isn't this what SimCity?
2762788	2768071	So Xbox One is going to have, you could put SimCity on Xbox One.
2768472	2770993	I think they're just saying it's something that they can implement.
2772454	2773355	Anybody can do that.
2773495	2775096	They can have an online only game.
2775977	2778458	That's up to the decision to the developer and the publisher.
2778578	2782781	So yeah, cool that they're offering this for developers to use if they need to.
2782801	2782981	Yeah.
2784062	2785463	I'm fine with that because you know what?
2785583	2790227	I'll figure out which games those are and I just won't play them if that's an issue for me.
2792389	2798274	So I just don't... Would this be a deal breaker for you?
2798694	2798914	Yes.
2799054	2804238	If they implement this not to your satisfaction, are you writing off this console completely?
2804739	2812305	Even if it has Killer Instinct, Grand Theft Auto 6, the games that you really want to have?
2812685	2812865	Yes.
2815187	2816428	I don't want to mess with this bullshit.
2817048	2818770	I don't have to mess with this bullshit on PC.
2818910	2819790	I'll build a new PC.
2822372	2825354	Or I will play the backlog of games I'm going to have.
2825374	2835420	And besides Grand Theft Auto 5, who knows, whenever Grand Theft Auto 6 comes out four or five years from now, I'm sure all this stuff will be ironed out already.
2835860	2840583	All right, let's talk about one other thing that had the internet a bit in a tizzy, and that's the always online thing.
2840623	2841784	Speaking of things that...
2842344	2845865	Got the internet into a lot of rabble rabble talking, whatever, right?
2846106	2847326	That guy got fired.
2847346	2849947	Yeah, I love how all these rumors are like, oh, there's no way.
2850087	2854749	Like I was even saying, there's no fucking way that they'd pull this shit off because they can't.
2854829	2859051	Because they're going to hurt themselves if Sony's not on board with this stuff.
2859391	2863272	And in a nutshell, it appears, and I don't think we really have a clear answer.
2863852	2865313	I don't think they've really clarified this.
2865353	2869795	I think this, again, came from one of them Kotaku interviews that turned into a headline.
2870615	2893872	but I what I'm understanding is that you will not need to be constantly connected to the internet but approximately once every 24 hours your Xbox needs to touch base with home to update the programming guide information and all that but it might need again we don't know they haven't really said it might impact the game transaction especially if you are having to
2894973	2897014	Lock and unlock codes and so forth.
2897334	2904940	That may be a part of this too, where you need to be connected once every 24 hours or your one may not let you do what you want to do.
2905160	2906401	See, that's what I was thinking.
2906681	2908522	Well, that's what I was hoping that they would do.
2909243	2912065	Ideally is that you would have that one-time use code.
2913046	2918410	And if you use that, then yes, you have to authenticate with a server so that you can run that game without a disk.
2919290	2923273	Once you install it, you'd have to authenticate it for the installation and it's tied to your account.
2923814	2924194	So be it.
2924274	2926456	Just like if you downloaded an Xbox Live arcade game.
2928378	2934102	But if you don't have that or if you can't authenticate it, you'd still be able to play the game as long as the disc is in the drive.
2934202	2936204	That was my hope because that makes sense to me.
2936344	2938005	It's simple, easy, we can do that.
2938786	2940007	But they're not going to have it that way.
2940027	2942648	No, they want, once again, they're treating you like a pirate.
2943008	2949430	They want to make sure that that shit is not somehow pirated onto your system and they're going to check it once every 24 hours.
2949790	2952371	And I don't buy it's to update their fucking channel guide.
2952511	2953092	Because you know what?
2953212	2956513	I'm not going to be using it for TV because as of right now, I can't.
2956809	2957950	I don't have a cable box.
2957970	2964517	I have a TV that a coax cable goes inside and I use my tuner to use the open QAM channels.
2965157	2968241	So I can't do that.
2969542	2970683	Oh, but you can actually.
2970883	2972405	You just have to buy a separate piece of hardware.
2972445	2973306	So fuck them for that.
2973706	2973926	Well...
2975007	2986433	Well, I mean, but I'm going to cut a little slack here because it's not like we didn't change at some point from the coaxial plug-in to the RCA switches, right?
2986453	2989354	Because, what, Atari 2600, you had to have coaxial.
2989695	2999099	Then you get into Nintendo NES, you can do that with an RF switch, or you can do the red-yellow plugs, red-yellow-white plugs, and then that turns into composite years later.
2999419	3000320	Now we're at HDMI.
3001821	3026636	I can't exactly fault the logical steps we're taking in input clarity I don't have anything to output HDMI into my console That's what I'm saying And yes, I do think it's a fucking ridiculous thing that they have where the console does not have component support The PlayStation 4 does, so I don't know why they can't do it here
3027677	3029520	VOG cough in our chat room.
3029741	3030843	Turn your head and VOG cough.
3031484	3036793	Says, Sky, what's the difference between Xbox One's every 24-hour authentication and Steam's authentication?
3038717	3040259	Fair question, but...
3041764	3049088	I guess one thing I think of, too, is that, okay, well, in order to use Steam in the first place, you had to be on the internet.
3049608	3057713	So, logically, you have an internet connection because you got Steam, whereas I don't necessarily need to be on the internet to pick up an Xbox One game.
3057753	3059574	I can walk into a GameStop and get that.
3060334	3082829	and you know again the the thing people most commonly cite military bases don't always have an internet connection a lot of them do though but like one of my friends is on the military and he doesn't post on Facebook all day long but but uh you know granted others don't necessarily have that connection so but they can still get the PC games mailed to them and so forth but that wasn't through Steam
3083829	3101737	so I mean that's I guess the key difference is that in order to get that Steam game in the first place you had to be on the internet so clearly you have an internet connection whereas with Xbox One if that's the only way to do it to play the game it is a little bit different than necessarily PC gaming so
3103308	3106132	I honestly, I don't know, I haven't really had a problem with internet.
3106192	3119829	I've been places without internet at my work or whatever and still play my Steam games just fine, but I do connect, I have internet at home and stuff, so I haven't really been without internet for a long span of time.
3120490	3125273	But I don't really know how Steam treats that, so I can't really say.
3125753	3127714	I do know that they have an offline mode.
3128255	3130036	Now, I'm not really sure how that works either.
3130216	3132337	Yeah, some people in chat are talking about offline mode right now.
3132397	3133418	And it works fine.
3136195	3136515	I don't know.
3136715	3140958	I would trust... It just doesn't seem that bad on Steam.
3141018	3142680	But then again, everything's digital on Steam.
3143160	3144081	Everything is digital.
3144281	3148824	And yes, I understand that they're using the excuse that, okay, you're just digitally downloading off a disc.
3149484	3151005	However you want to fucking word that.
3151346	3152286	That's ridiculous.
3155469	3156029	I just don't know.
3157250	3167295	I just don't like the fact that game companies still treat everybody as a licensed user instead of you own this like I own a car.
3167375	3174558	Well, but judging from the internet reaction, some people are basing their decision on this console on that.
3175098	3175598	You know what I mean?
3175998	3181001	If this used thing pans out to be true, there's a lot of people on the internet that are...
3181781	3189624	Well, right now, like I said... And you might say, angry fanboys, da-da-da-da-da, but, you know, every one of those comments is coming from a potential buyer.
3189804	3193626	I haven't made any firm decisions about any console yet, so, you know, whatever.
3193666	3199828	And I don't think anybody should until at least E3, because, to be fair, again, we don't know the answers to this, necessarily.
3199848	3201508	We're having to read between the lines on a lot of this.
3201648	3203729	And on top of that... Microsoft needs to make it crystal clear.
3203869	3204810	And on top of that... So does Sony.
3204830	3208431	We need to see what games are coming, because... I don't know.
3209011	3210472	Forza 5's kind of cool, but...
3211670	3212811	Do I need a console for that?
3213091	3213311	Nope.
3237901	3239802	That's going to be a hard one to say no to, right?
3241302	3241522	Yeah.
3242583	3245864	Well, actually, no, not for me, because I never was a fan of Killer Instinct.
3246024	3246664	Oh, get out.
3247165	3247445	All right.
3247465	3260150	Although, Crackdown, Crackdown 3, which there is a rumor that that's going to be one of the games, because they had the little orb icon on their dashboard during the presentation.
3261710	3263711	I may have to get in on that.
3265452	3270475	One other thing I want to mention about the hardware and the always online in this is the whole Kinect.
3271355	3275057	So the Kinect apparently has to be plugged in.
3275538	3276698	You have to have that.
3276758	3280120	Again, I don't know if this is coming directly from Microsoft or where this came from.
3280180	3282842	Do you know where we ended up at this conclusion?
3283202	3286504	I think it was one of the after interview things.
3286584	3286744	Hmm.
3287564	3315705	I understand why it has to be because they have it's once again it's just like games being installed to the hard drive they have to assume that you have it so they can use it they can't just you know program it so that you don't have it although I mean it would be nice to assume that you have it and then you know if the game doesn't use it maybe just not well actually because you're still gonna have to use it for the interface it'd be cool if you turn that off and if a game needs it it'd be like a controller's unplugged or something
3316005	3337685	Here's the thing, and this is causing a lot of people, like, somebody on Twitter was saying that they had heard Glenn Beck, which I'm so sorry that you had to hear that, but maybe it was people that were listening to Glenn Beck or whatever, that apparently they were talking about this on a show the other day, about the conspiracy theories about how the Connect is how the government is going to spy on us in our homes, and all this.
3337765	3338826	I think, you know, and...
3339466	3341507	Which was totally the plot of an episode of Scandal.
3341527	3346928	I'm sorry, but this is going to once again out me that I still read Kotaku occasionally.
3347609	3347949	Sorry.
3348469	3349509	It's a hard habit to break.
3349529	3352530	You like trash.
3352610	3353511	Just admit it.
3354451	3354711	Listen.
3355991	3375821	I fully understand Sometimes you find cans in the garbage so you can go recycle It's not that I'm entertained by what they're posting because honestly I hold Polygon to the same level of garbage in their postings so I like to have the full picture and I read everything and even if that means reading the same story like five times
3376321	3388543	But they actually wanted their posts on there where they were trying to get people to send messages to Fox News because they wanted to run the whole campaign of the Xbox One doesn't let our troops play games.
3389464	3390344	You need to get on that.
3390364	3391404	Oh, fuck that.
3391484	3402046	Because, you know, you... Okay, so when Fox News decides to go on something, some crazy-ass tangent that Mass Effect has crazy lesbian sex and is corrupting our kids or whatever...
3402426	3406716	You know, you want to tear them down, but then, oh, now it's suddenly convenient.
3406756	3410745	We might need them to be a mouthpiece to, you know, get on the gaming companies.
3410825	3412289	Like, go.
3414827	3416828	Get a new hobby, for fuck's sake.
3419270	3420511	And there's some questions in chat.
3420551	3421591	Polygon is garbage?
3421931	3422212	Yes.
3422952	3423412	I'm sorry.
3423633	3425053	I don't agree, by the way.
3425354	3426754	That's Loki's opinion, not mine.
3426774	3427475	That's my opinion.
3427575	3428015	I'm sorry.
3428095	3430657	Let me change that review five more times.
3431097	3432598	Actually, it isn't trash anymore.
3432698	3433479	I think it's great.
3434179	3435100	Oh, nope, trash again.
3435820	3436280	Nope, it's great.
3437121	3438802	Anyway, that's not what this episode's about.
3438862	3441123	All right, here's what I wanted to say about the always-on Kinect.
3441263	3448067	So my assumption is one of the reasons it needs to do that is because, you know, to walk into your house and say, like, Xbox, turn on, and all this.
3448088	3454051	But now after what you said about the whole it wants to see how many people are in the room to watch a movie, like, I kind of can't help but go, God, that's weird.
3454832	3456332	How are you going to stop that?
3456352	3457073	Are you blocking it?
3457093	3458114	They're going to say something's blocking this.
3458134	3458534	Why not?
3459074	3462596	Why can't I just turn my Kinect around to face the wall and cover the mic?
3462696	3463637	Because it'll be like, where are you?
3465563	3468445	Then if the system does... I'm going to be honest.
3468645	3470286	I am going to be perfectly honest.
3470806	3476489	If that's how the system's going to work, that almost concerns me more than the used game HUBBLU thing.
3477037	3486380	Like, sometimes, guys, I like to, when I get home, take off my pants, then sit down in the couch and play some video games.
3486720	3492561	And I don't necessarily need a camera on me showing what I look like down there in the corner or whatever when I'm doing that.
3492701	3493982	Or if you get a quick Skype call.
3494482	3498623	What if I accidentally leave Skype open or, you know, heaven forbid, the voice command, you know?
3499623	3501826	Xbox, broadcast live on Twitch.
3502247	3503328	I don't know what happens.
3504630	3506152	I don't really want that.
3506172	3507194	That's stupid, bitch.
3507434	3508355	Launching Twitch.
3511039	3511820	Yeah, something like that.
3511840	3512561	Exactly, right?
3514223	3514624	Now, I...
3515248	3522251	I realize they're talking about these privacy settings and so forth, but again, you're asking me to just fucking trust you.
3522491	3530434	One cool thing we forgot to mention is they're gonna have the same, not really sharing feature, but it's gonna record your gameplay and you can edit it with an editor and stuff.
3530454	3530894	That's kinda cool.
3533450	3534911	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3555831	3560652	I take my console and my game on a monitor that has DVIN and VGA.
3560772	3562753	I guess I have my DVI cables now, but whatever.
3563173	3567414	If I didn't have those cables, it only has DVIN or VGA in.
3567814	3571675	I can't do that because, see, I have all these wonderful cables for my Xbox 360.
3571935	3572896	I have a VGA cable.
3572916	3573256	They made it.
3573276	3574116	It was fantastic.
3574736	3577257	But now that they got rid of that multi-AV port...
3578397	3579818	I'm stuck with fucking HDMI.
3579918	3587725	Yes, I know I could buy a brand new monitor that has HDMI in, but why am I going to fucking spend more money to play a game system that I've got to buy also?
3587946	3589667	That's also going to have more expensive games.
3590368	3591328	Why do I want to do that?
3592650	3597474	VOGKoff in our chatroom brings up another story that kind of ties into the whole Kinect thing.
3598274	3605457	Rob, all the voice commands being demoed on the Xbox One affected all Kinect users on 360, stopping streams and such.
3605917	3612380	I'm sure you read about that, where people that were watching the streams on the 360, the voice commands were fucking with the plug-in.
3612420	3613260	It's even worse than that.
3613320	3614881	Like, actual stuff on TV.
3614981	3622424	Like, they were showing one episode of someone watching an episode of the Cleveland show, and it was saying something about their, like, stop.
3623024	3625065	I'm going to stop that.
3625406	3628168	And it kept stopping his stream when he was playing it.
3628188	3630970	And the only way he can do it is mute it to get past it.
3631050	3633651	So if my Kinect is plugged in, think about it.
3633832	3639616	Somebody on live television could get up there and just yell into the microphone, Xbox, broadcast!
3639716	3640876	That's the old Kinect.
3640896	3642558	The old Kinect doesn't determine.
3642878	3644039	It only listens to sound.
3644279	3648862	The new Kinect is actually going to see you and it's going to know which person is saying that, allegedly.
3649222	3653486	Unless, of course, you could mime it and then someone else yells it out, in which case it probably wouldn't know.
3653946	3654506	But I don't know.
3654747	3656008	They're going to have a way around that.
3656768	3658089	It's a more sophisticated now.
3659731	3660071	All right.
3660811	3662993	I think that covers most of the bases.
3663233	3666396	There's a few other stories that came out after the Xbox One.
3667096	3673221	Some things on a positive note, certainly, is that they're talking about a 1 versus 100 style game for Xbox One.
3673642	3677705	Not at launch, but certainly within the opportunity for the future.
3678065	3683970	And that doesn't necessarily mean it will be 1 versus 100, but you know I never shut up about how great that was and that it died way too soon on 360.
3684930	3689274	So I'm really excited that they are talking about bringing back that type of idea on Xbox One.
3689294	3691736	That would certainly make the system a lot more attractive.
3692496	3696620	and some YouTubes out there that are skewering the press conference a little bit.
3696720	3702386	One of them just repeats TV, TV, TV, Call of Duty, Call of Duty, Call of Duty and sports, sports, sports over and over again.
3703747	3708611	I don't think that those videos are as hilarious as the PlayStation 3 press conference years ago.
3708631	3712115	No, they had the same guy did it and his was kind of funny.
3712788	3716431	But at the same time, you know, I didn't hate the press conference.
3717132	3720314	The press conference they had was exactly the type of stuff I expected.
3720354	3724278	It's everything that came out after the fact on the internet that's causing the concern.
3724718	3725959	The press conference itself was fine.
3726380	3727781	I had no problem with the press conference.
3728341	3729742	Yeah, it was literally all the information.
3730023	3733145	After the press conference, I was like, I guess I'm going to have to get an Xbox One.
3733185	3734546	And then after the press conference, I was like...
3735487	3736928	Not with this information, though.
3737208	3738628	All right.
3739269	3746572	Any other news-type things that we need to bring up that you think we might have missed somewhere along the line?
3747772	3751494	PlayStation 4 is teasing the reveal of their console.
3751534	3752634	Yeah, I saw it the day before.
3752654	3753315	Yeah, it was funny.
3754689	3756210	We're going to open up the Skype line in a moment.
3756270	3760692	If you guys want to call in, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use our name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
3760732	3765974	Again, that is if you are here with us live on Thursday night, May 23rd, 2013.
3766434	3769855	If you're hearing the rebroadcast on Sunday, we're actually not here.
3770195	3771716	We took Memorial Day weekend off, but we'll...
3772376	3773497	Where are you right now with Xbox One?
3793559	3795099	I just need to figure out what they're doing.
3795339	3803281	Because they're going back and forth and I don't even know how the used game thing works and what the online only stuff is.
3803381	3805121	And that's all software anyways.
3805501	3807422	So that can be changed in a drop of a hat.
3807922	3810562	So until it comes out, we don't know.
3811082	3815523	I just hope that they kind of figure out, hey, maybe that's not a good idea to do that right now.
3815903	3817744	Maybe wait until the next generation.
3818484	3818904	Or, you know...
3820024	3820304	I don't know.
3820404	3821625	It's just like, you know, EA.
3822165	3828106	They had news this week that, oh, it's like we're actually developing some games for Wii U, just not as many.
3828987	3836929	I mean, so what's to say that EA, I mean, it wouldn't be very popular, but what's to say EA couldn't say, ha ha, just kidding, we're going to have online passes anyways.
3839090	3840010	We changed our minds.
3842217	3860679	they're called like freedom passes now I'm in a similar boat where it's like you know what it's just too soon to make a determination on Xbox One there's some things I like that I'm hearing and there's some things I don't like that I'm hearing you know and back to the golden rule of gaming a system is only as good as the games that are on it and although I'm
3860919	3862500	I'm not interested in Quantum Break.
3863140	3864440	That's not enough for me right now.
3864901	3868242	I'm very curious to see what E3 brings when they unveil these other titles.
3868662	3871984	I bet there's going to be something in there, especially if Killer Instinct is one of the games.
3872044	3874545	That's something that's going to give me great pause.
3875185	3880707	But if they screw up this use thing or the connect thing, that could be a deal breaker for me.
3881007	3884509	But I'm not going to sit here and say, I'm definitely not buying one now.
3884989	3888331	because my opinion can damn well flip-flop one way or the other.
3888911	3892072	Yeah, it's just like people going, well, I'm definitely buying a PlayStation 4 now.
3892112	3893313	I'm not buying an Xbox One.
3893353	3895414	I'm like, you don't even know what the hell they're doing.
3895434	3897515	I think Sony's got a lot to say, too.
3897755	3904238	And I know we haven't been talking about them tonight because the focus hasn't been on them this week, but there's still a lot of questions they've got to answer, too.
3904478	3906159	Like, we don't know what they're using.
3906359	3908060	I think they've said that they support you.
3908820	3910903	Once again, they say they're supporting used games here too.
3911244	3911885	Yeah, exactly.
3911945	3913707	Microsoft's able to say the same thing.
3913807	3916571	So I kind of need that to be crystal clear.
3918254	3920497	So we'll find out more.
3921158	3923762	And again, at least I know how my Wii U works.
3926556	3932098	I got to go here with you though, Loki, because you're one of Nintendo's biggest critics.
3932138	3938620	But I was having some Twitter conversations earlier this week and talking about Xbox One and all the tin hat foil theories.
3939220	3950004	Do you see a path here where Nintendo could, and I want to sound fanboy here, but do you see a path here where Nintendo could walk away with this holiday season?
3951324	3951424	No.
3953063	3953544	you know why?
3953745	3953946	why?
3954046	3959964	because the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 are still out there and I'm sorry, even if even if, you know
3961411	3963012	The Wii U does okay.
3963633	3967496	You've still got all the really big games coming out on the current-gen consoles.
3968377	3974522	Hell, we can consider the Wii U a current-gen console, too, because it's pretty much the same as far as graphics go.
3975383	3978986	In fact, actually, it won't have Battlefield 4, so there's one strike against it.
3979026	3981648	I mean, you may not care for some people.
3981668	3982909	Zelda game, who cares?
3983009	3983790	Mario Kart, who cares?
3984831	3987294	But I don't think it's going to... I kind of care about Mario Kart.
3987335	3987935	I think a lot of people do.
3987955	3991100	I'm saying, like, you know, who cares because you have Mario Kart.
3991120	3991600	That's what I'm saying.
3993900	3999142	I don't know, I don't buy all the systems for Mario Kart anyways, so who knows, maybe we'll get a Wii U this fall Right?
3999482	4020708	That's gonna be the hilarious thing that happens I'm gonna laugh so fucking hard if that happens, if Loki ends up walking out with a Wii U this fall Say that now No, I am saying that now, because Mario Kart 7 is kind of lame So, I'm not gonna buy a system for one game, unless they have Excite Truck 2, in which case I will be buying that game See?
4020748	4021048	See?
4022808	4024009	Mario Kart, no, I'm sorry.
4024029	4031174	It's not going to be a big sight truck, and if it's awesome, it'll be... BlackWolfInChat bringing up a little thing that we missed.
4031574	4034016	You can have more than 100 friends on Xbox One.
4034036	4034716	1,000 friends.
4034736	4035076	1,000 friends.
4036577	4040880	That's great, but I have to express a little bit of disappointment that why didn't they just roll that out on 360?
4041000	4041461	Exactly.
4041741	4042861	Wait a second.
4042901	4044763	Actually, won't it have to be on 360?
4045223	4046844	Because your live account's... That's a good point.
4046944	4049666	Your live account's going to be tied to the Xbox One.
4049686	4049906	Exactly.
4050086	4052509	So... How's that gonna work?
4052529	4053249	How's that gonna work?
4053570	4057253	If I get my friends list up to 150 on the Xbox One, what happens when I go back to my 360?
4057293	4059796	They're gonna have to fix it.
4059916	4060096	Ha!
4060156	4060576	Fuck you!
4060616	4060877	Ha!
4060897	4062298	We saw right through it.
4062498	4063900	You're just trying to get us to buy another console.
4063920	4064760	Case closed.
4067028	4072093	Yeah, I guess there's going to have to be a... They're going to need that extra cloud competing to figure out where your other friends are, I guess.
4072213	4072894	I don't know.
4072934	4074595	Or maybe only the first hundred will show up.
4074675	4076637	Oh, God, that would be so... I'm sorry.
4076677	4080621	I'm going to have to give... Only these hundred people get a rose.
4080661	4082083	Everyone else will have to go home.
4083649	4087270	You're going to have to go home and live on the Xbox One until I come back and visit you.
4089691	4095273	Alright, we're getting close to the end here of our little chat, but I do want to open it up the Skype line and see what you guys have to say.
4095593	4098934	So if you are listening to us live on this Thursday night, May 23rd, go ahead and give us a call.
4098954	4102355	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4102675	4105236	We want to know your thoughts on Xbox One.
4106256	4132869	some of the other news to come out from the world of gaming since there is no show this Sunday I want to just throw some of these other things out here real quick release date today for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn August 27th I knew it was August I was guessing a week earlier I was wrong you were wrong August 27th collector edition pre-orders are already available looks like it's I'm excited about XIV Realm Reborn I'd be more excited if it was a pay to play and that was it no monthly fee
4133589	4153542	I'm not going to buy it Who knows One of the last holdouts is going free to play in June Rift is finally going free to play Come on Final Fantasy 11 What the hell I seriously can't think of any games that charge a monthly fee at this point besides WoW and Final Fantasy 11 and 14 or in the future 14
4154383	4157646	Did you see Mario and Wario's Crowd Farter?
4169878	4171759	The Little Parody of Kickstarter.
4172079	4173240	That was some great shade.
4173780	4178102	I'm sorry, I was really a fan of that, what they did there.
4178163	4182925	The whole, like, if you share on Facebook and Twitter and it gets to certain levels, they'll unlock.
4183245	4190629	And granted, a lot of the stuff they're talking about unlocking is kind of dumb, like, you know, backgrounds and new trailers and things like that, which is a little silly.
4190969	4196592	But I really love some of the parody they did of Kickstarters with their little crowd farter.
4196632	4197313	That was pretty funny.
4198133	4204017	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to talk to us about the Xbox One.
4205598	4213884	EA may have backtracked a little bit on their earlier statements about the Wii U. This was coming from a comment from... I'm trying to bring it up here.
4218137	4221618	This was from Jeff Brown, who is an EA spokesperson.
4221978	4225139	Oh, sorry, that was the person who originally said no games in development for the Wii U currently.
4225760	4230241	Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen, quote, And not in 2013.
4245566	4245966	Interesting.
4245986	4247746	So I wonder what it is they're doing.
4248287	4249247	They haven't announced anything.
4249267	4250147	There's nothing coming.
4250487	4253628	Unless they do maybe a port of Need for Speed when that comes out.
4253688	4256528	Or maybe a port of whatever Star Wars project's coming up.
4256628	4266450	Because if the Wii U is the, and I'm using my little quotey fingers, kiddie console, then maybe a Star Wars thing on the Wii U would make a lot of sense.
4266510	4269831	They could do a Lego Star Wars game, another one, or something like that.
4271411	4285514	I can guarantee that they don't have NCAA, they don't have FIFA, they don't have Madden, they don't have NBA Live as a Wii U title and definitely not Battlefield.
4285954	4291475	So far, I don't think there's anything left this year that EA is putting out that has a Wii U title to it.
4291575	4292756	They have nothing coming.
4293736	4298317	If it's anything, it's going to be 2014 and maybe the next round of sports games.
4298337	4298917	Maybe they're going to
4299737	4304682	Maybe I think they're going to take a wait-and-see approach and see how the sales go of the console.
4304722	4308465	If it picks up in the fall, then it'll warrant them making a Wii U version.
4308706	4309586	It's always what it's been.
4309626	4315011	It's not been, I don't think, a personal vendetta against them or something because of any sort of draconian DRM thing.
4315072	4315572	Or tinfoil.
4317854	4320555	I think it makes sense because everybody's doing it.
4320615	4321456	It's not just EA.
4321496	4325479	Everybody's not making stuff for the Wii U because they're just not selling to make consoles.
4325919	4331663	It costs a lot of money to port your game over and if you're only going to sell like 100,000 copies then it's not worth it.
4333874	4338115	to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
4338495	4341075	Use the passphrase, dress.
4341135	4344476	Square Enix apparently going to be doing some E3 video shows.
4344756	4346336	Shocking, it's a video.
4347576	4352337	Well, at least they're not making everybody get tickets to go in the theater to just sit there and watch a bunch of trailers.
4352377	4353818	At least they're not doing that, to be fair.
4353838	4354238	They should.
4354258	4356418	They should make you get tickets and wait online.
4356458	4357218	You think?
4357258	4357998	That would be kind of funny.
4358038	4358739	Let's go to the phones.
4358879	4359699	Finally, it's lighting up.
4359739	4360679	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4360719	4361039	Who's this?
4362162	4362963	Hey, it's Sterlok.
4363203	4364384	Hey, Sterlok, what's up, buddy?
4366005	4369407	Not too much, just wanted to talk about the Xbox One a little bit here.
4369608	4374311	Yeah, you had a very interesting Twitter rant earlier this week that a lot of people might not be thinking of.
4374331	4376213	I don't know if you were going to tap into that.
4377434	4378554	Yeah, definitely.
4379815	4380896	That's definitely part of it.
4381597	4389803	So, yeah, well, we don't know if this is... Do we know if this is actually true or not, the whole code thing?
4390160	4390720	We don't.
4391201	4396605	They are not going to say one way or the other until E3.
4396685	4399787	There's a lot of vague vagueness right now, so we just don't know.
4399847	4403910	We have nothing but internet wank to go off of and conspiracy tinfoil hat theories.
4404831	4405672	Yeah, that's what I figured.
4407213	4418061	If they do go that route and you have to enter a code, say on the box, like the online passes worked, that essentially means that
4419190	4429273	If I want to play a new game on the Xbox One, I'm going to have to get someone cited to enter the code for me.
4429713	4438395	And sometimes it might be a little while before someone's got the time that can do that.
4441116	4446237	Like with the 360 and every other console, I can't just buy a game and pop it in the system.
4446577	4446797	Mm-hmm.
4449203	4452205	We don't know if it's going to work that way.
4452565	4460708	As a blind gamer, do you run into accessibility issues on any current gen consoles when it comes to being able to just kind of pop in and play a new game?
4460868	4462609	Do you ever have to get assistance there?
4466450	4470772	It's mostly just memorizing how the layout of the menus and stuff work.
4470912	4472613	I had to kind of
4473220	4478684	I'm going to have to do it again probably when they update the 360s dashboard.
4480185	4485869	But especially just memorizing the dashboard just to know how the hell to get to the XBLA games.
4486890	4488251	That's really all it is.
4488351	4489652	It's not that big of a deal.
4490017	4492619	Well, hopefully they will do some type of accessibility.
4492679	4502648	I mean, I can understand why they can't spend a lot of time at their 60-minute little unveiling to talk about accessibility, but it would be nice to hear a little bit about that.
4503969	4505250	And they could do it.
4508353	4517701	What a lot of people are pushing for now, and I think this argument has a little more traction now with this whole all-in-one thing
4518331	4521092	Entertainment Center, the thing that they're trying to do.
4521993	4526375	There really should be some sort of accessibility thing built in.
4526535	4541082	Because Windows 8 now has, they redid their narrator screen reader, which they've kind of always had, but it's always been sort of a joke.
4541503	4541783	Right.
4544524	4547586	But they redid it for Windows 8, and it's actually not that bad.
4547886	4548046	Hmm.
4549262	4553385	They could probably, if they really wanted to, do.
4553465	4561611	But I think, honestly, we're just such a small market, really, that it doesn't really matter to do them.
4561651	4564032	It's not really cost effective for them to do that.
4564533	4569476	Yeah, but it's such a... I don't know, that perspective would just be so harsh.
4569656	4572158	It sucks, but... It's not cool, you know?
4572758	4573039	Yeah.
4573139	4574019	It makes me not want to like them.
4574119	4575400	It sucks, but it's just the way it is.
4576161	4576481	Yeah.
4576501	4576581	Yeah.
4577133	4580614	But with the voice commands, that does alleviate some of it.
4581454	4582774	With the connect voice commands.
4583154	4590516	I guess that's... Okay, so I guess there's a positive in there, is that, yeah, if you can kind of drive the entire console with your voice, you may not need to memorize the menus, right?
4591596	4592596	Yeah, exactly.
4592877	4601658	I could just say, hey, play... I don't know, well, I can't say another XBLA, play Guardian Heroes or something.
4601799	4602199	Yeah, yeah.
4603319	4603659	But, um...
4605177	4607279	I don't know, XBLA games, you'd think they could...
4619335	4620455	Figure something out.
4620635	4622016	It's the chipset.
4622896	4629718	I mean, it sucks, but I'm hoping that it has long-term payoff with better games.
4630878	4635219	It would sure add a lot of better value if we could have the backwards compatibility, that's for sure.
4636319	4641201	Also, I wanted to bring up, I don't know if it's in the show role, but this Rare announcement.
4642681	4642961	Go ahead.
4644062	4645002	What do you guys think it's going to be?
4645382	4645662	I don't know.
4646755	4652797	Killer Instinct is pretty much the one thing that will guarantee me, no matter what they do with the Xbox One, that will guarantee me a purchase.
4652837	4653637	Killer Instinct, man, that's
4673425	4675708	Anything with Killer Instinct on it, I will buy.
4676809	4681475	You'll sell these morals about codes and things like that for some more Killer Instinct.
4681495	4684219	There's a lot of gamers that are like that.
4684239	4686181	It's one of the best fighting games ever fucking made.
4687283	4688304	Tell Loki about it.
4689005	4690847	Just as long as they get the original announcer back.
4692950	4696293	They gotta get that original announcer with the ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-bo breaker.
4698175	4698415	Alright.
4699175	4703319	Sterlok, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but any other last thoughts for our listeners?
4704720	4708844	Um... E3 is gonna be really interesting this year.
4709244	4710165	To say the least.
4710725	4711626	Alright, buddy, you take care.
4711646	4713267	Alright, you too.
4713287	4713888	Alright, bye.
4715939	4717460	Now our phone's ringing a little bit more.
4717520	4718341	Let's go to another call.
4718501	4719562	We already have another call coming in.
4719902	4720743	Hi, you're on Orange Moms Radio.
4720763	4721103	Who's this?
4721723	4722624	Hello, it's Shane.
4722724	4723344	Hey, Shane.
4723384	4723925	How you doing?
4724845	4726386	I am fine.
4726847	4727887	Happy birthday.
4728468	4728968	Thank you.
4729028	4731170	You're listening to this little show on your birthday?
4731850	4735132	It's like almost midnight here, so the day's pretty much over.
4735492	4735833	Okay.
4736113	4737854	Your 30th birthday, nonetheless.
4738334	4740396	My 25th birthday.
4740436	4741296	Thank you very much.
4741316	4742317	Okay, Bobby Blackwolf.
4742377	4742677	All right.
4743598	4744298	What's on your mind?
4744318	4745159	What do you want to say tonight?
4746420	4749843	I am so excited for Final Fantasy XIV after today.
4749863	4753166	What do you want to say?
4753486	4755548	Wait a minute, you didn't call in to talk about Xbox One?
4756429	4758090	Who cares about that stupid system?
4760092	4771602	For my job, which I'm sure I've talked about what my job is, but I don't need to say it now, but I was talking with retail people about it on Wednesday.
4771642	4772422	People that work at maybe...
4773379	4778905	Target and Walmart and GameStop and all that, nobody had something positive to say about it.
4779646	4781028	Everybody was hating on it.
4781388	4783050	Every single person I talked to.
4783090	4787475	Were they hating on the press conference or were they hating on the internet hysteria that happened afterwards?
4787635	4788997	They were hating on...
4789537	4791878	The details that were being said.
4792119	4799563	Nothing about what a waste of an hour that was or man, everybody's up in arms on the internet.
4799643	4805166	They were like, this is the stuff that I read about that came out of that conference.
4805707	4807768	This is what I saw at the conference.
4808128	4810269	I don't care about anything they said.
4810289	4812431	I was like, yeah, okay.
4812851	4813571	That makes sense.
4814732	4816373	Same boat as most everybody.
4818766	4820788	Where's your head at with Xbox One right now?
4820868	4822189	Is it something you think you would pick up?
4823270	4826933	Killer Instinct can't make me pick that up, and that says a lot.
4827474	4829395	Because I love Killer Instinct.
4829515	4831677	Can't E3 still change your mind?
4831897	4840244	I mean, what if it does turn out this situation with the used games and the Kinect is not as bad as we're all making it out to be, and E3 shows us everything's just fine?
4840304	4841065	Would that change your mind?
4841613	4855467	No, because before going into the press event, Microsoft doesn't have anything exclusive that I care enough about that would make me want to shell out the money for a brand new VCR.
4856368	4856628	Like...
4857949	4862293	I, with the other two companies, they have exclusives I care about.
4862713	4870839	Microsoft had Alan Wake, which they don't really do anything with anymore, and Dance Central, which I'll get by.
4871119	4872700	I'll get by not having Dance Central.
4872780	4881026	Who knows if it'll stay Connect, or Microsoft only, or if it will go to Sony's new camera-y thing.
4881446	4881887	Who knows?
4881907	4882187	Yeah.
4882527	4897517	but those two wouldn't have been enough and if somehow they let Rare do something cool and like make Killer Instinct well honestly Killer Instinct 1 was fantastic and 2 was crap so they don't really have a great
4898297	4900178	History either with that franchise.
4900238	4905442	It's like the now defunct Silicon Knights.
4905562	4908364	They make one good game and everything else they make is crap.
4908604	4912586	Sorry, I'm laughing at what Alan Alchemy says in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
4913287	4916489	Mass Effect 4, Kden Academy, Xbox One exclusive.
4917230	4918590	Would that change your mind?
4918610	4920752	I don't know.
4922401	4923161	Possibly.
4923922	4924462	There we go.
4924582	4935206	Okay, if Mass Effect somehow became an exclusive there and didn't require Kinect stuff, then... See, the right game will make you sell all your morals.
4935526	4940969	But I don't think it would be possible for it to do that because EA wants money and they're not going to put...
4942009	4971418	a game like Mass Effect on one system again they did that for Mass Effect 1 I've seen weirder things happen in gaming alright I gotta wrap up soon so we can get more calls but I do want you to have your say on Final Fantasy 14 so what would you like to say about Realm Reborn everybody needs to watch the new trailer it's beautiful and the box art for the collector's edition is super pretty and I am so pumped up for this game that I pre-ordered it twice why would you pre-order it twice I don't get it
4972378	4982715	because I want the collector's edition and I want a way to play it on PS3 but I did not want the PS3 collector's edition.
4985870	4988052	Alright Anything else Shane before I let you go?
4990794	5010407	Bobby I can talk about whatever I want when I'm on the phone I don't want to talk about the Xbox Don't use this as a platform to yell at chatters Go into chat room and yell at him that way Take care Shane Oh he hung up on me Jerk I hope your birthday sucks What's left of it?
5010787	5011428	Six minutes
5013849	5014189	All right.
5015009	5016890	I hope you get an earthquake in the next six minutes.
5016930	5017310	No, I don't.
5017370	5018010	No, I don't.
5018170	5018631	I don't mean that.
5018951	5019231	All right.
5019791	5020451	Let's go to the phones.
5020491	5021371	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
5021391	5021732	Who's this?
5022612	5023392	Hey, this is Actdeft.
5023452	5024052	Hey, Actdeft.
5024072	5024533	What's on your mind?
5025733	5029434	Well, talking about the X-Bone or the X-B1, whatever.
5029614	5030574	The X-Boner, yeah.
5032535	5041147	Well, one thing most people don't, well, I think they haven't talked or thought into consideration is the price.
5042109	5047236	Maybe, how about if the XB1 or even the PS4
5048943	5061509	are cheap enough to even, it doesn't matter the factor of all the crappy things they're announcing for it, maybe if the price is low,
5063657	5064478	Will people get it?
5065138	5093040	Well, you know, these rumors keep going around, which, you know, Xbox or Microsoft rumors tend to be true, which is funny because it came up on one of our list lists, you know, last year, that Xbox could go the subsidy route, where maybe an Xbox One will only cost you $199.99, but with a two-year contract obligation to Xbox Gold or Xbox Network for Halo TV or whatever they decide to add in with it.
5095100	5107929	Well, yeah, it may work, but I really wonder if people will just go ahead and buy it, even or despite all the things, just because it's cheap.
5109910	5113693	So that's most of what I think right now.
5114153	5120937	Though, in general, I wouldn't get an Xbox One, at least not at launch, maybe.
5121858	5129362	Mostly because it doesn't have a component or an RCA port, so I don't have an HDTV.
5130263	5130923	Interesting.
5131723	5139748	And most people I know maybe do have an HDTV that handles HDMI, but...
5141369	5157301	I don't know that many people I have a pretty early HD TV where mine only had component cables it wasn't capable of doing 1080p either it could do 1080i but not 1080p see my other TV I have only has DVI and it can only do 1080i
5157921	5163323	Yeah, so, yeah, you couldn't, I couldn't do, that's the TV that's in our bedroom, I couldn't do an HDMI.
5163343	5171426	That reminds me, so, I know that's gonna support, you know, those resolutions and stuff, but is it gonna get all fucked up when you try to hook up your system?
5171466	5172807	Is it gonna try to do 1080p?
5172887	5177629	It's like, oh, sorry, can't do 1080p on this TV, so, fuck you.
5177649	5178569	Yeah, I don't know.
5178869	5183991	Well, a lot of people have only 720 TVs, though, because of, like, $299 sales at Walmart and whatever.
5184191	5186612	I just, I don't know how it's gonna work.
5187509	5191252	Maybe it will have native resolution.
5192092	5192392	Don't know.
5193013	5196435	What if there was a converter, something you could do to convert the signal?
5196535	5198036	Would that change your mind?
5198296	5198656	You can.
5200177	5205661	There is HDMI to DVI or even, I think, component.
5206081	5207362	I have one of those.
5207762	5212305	But even then, it's like not having the greatest quality.
5213026	5215688	So I wouldn't get that even...
5216997	5220901	even though I could easily get a replacement for it.
5222682	5224264	I would rather have an HDTV.
5224924	5236074	And Ranma, I know HDTVs are cheap in the United States, but get on my side of the border, those things are hell expensive.
5237904	5242450	And that was a response to a comment from Ranma who said, HDTVs are cheap, don't give me that shit.
5242470	5247936	But yeah, you live in Mexico and there might be fees to import things and whatever.
5248517	5252462	Sometimes it doesn't cost the same that it would here, so it makes sense.
5254933	5257735	Don't you sometimes travel to the States, though, to make big purchases?
5258035	5258456	You could.
5258616	5259256	You could, right?
5259757	5275390	I could, yeah, but it's still something that isn't easy to do because the customs, if you have certain merchandise over a certain price, you have to, well, register.
5275790	5276831	Declare it and all that.
5276891	5277472	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5279113	5307206	well okay but so basically your big hold up on Xbox One is that it's just going to be too big of a pain in the ass to actually play the thing and I'm getting the sense there's really nothing yet I mean granted we haven't had E3 but there's nothing yet that's really selling you on the system but could I mean if they come out at E3 and say Killer Instinct are we going to be having a different conversation or is there a game that would make you go alright I'll get in the car and drive to get my HDTV I mean is there any game that would make you start putting that in motion
5308146	5309067	They already have it.
5309167	5310048	It's Force of Five.
5312471	5315535	I want Force of Five, but the console isn't...
5317296	5318137	I don't want to...
5346809	5351871	to justify buying the console and getting all the trouble or passing all the trouble.
5352171	5355673	I got to say, though, as much as Forza 5 looks cool, I want a Forza Horizon 2.
5356653	5358214	Oh, yeah.
5358394	5360435	Don't hate me, but I don't even really like the Forza games.
5360535	5364557	But because Forza Horizon was more of like an arcade style, I loved it.
5365277	5366217	You know what I want?
5367158	5369759	I want, and just because we don't have it yet,
5370499	5372201	How many consoles are launching right now?
5372401	5374082	And no fucking Ridge Racer.
5374503	5375123	Seriously.
5375504	5377125	There is no Ridge Racer.
5377746	5380408	Good question.
5381029	5381389	Wait for E3.
5381429	5382210	I want Ridge Racer.
5382290	5382730	I don't care.
5382850	5383791	I liked Ridge Racer 6.
5384011	5386794	Ridge Racer 6 is awesome.
5387174	5391798	I think Sony should make a nod to their little blunder from a few years ago.
5392079	5394461	And I think they should get Kazurai up on stage to go.
5394801	5396583	And ladies and gentlemen, one more game, you guys.
5397139	5398760	It's Ridge Racer!
5399000	5401041	Even better.
5401262	5407805	I want him to come out on a Power Wheels, like Corvette or something like that, and he's all, Ridge Racer!
5409326	5411708	With the little bike helmet crashing off the stage, yes.
5412128	5412468	Yeah.
5412949	5413229	Alright.
5413469	5414329	That would be hilarious.
5414369	5415590	Alright, Actdeft, I gotta let you go.
5415610	5418152	I'm gonna try to squeeze in one more call, but thanks for the call and the insight.
5418792	5419352	Oh yeah, thanks.
5419553	5420193	Thanks for having me.
5420433	5420993	Alright, no problem.
5421013	5421394	Take care, buddy.
5422034	5423715	We'll try to squeeze in one more call.
5423735	5426756	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
5427036	5428896	Keep in mind, you can also always email your thoughts.
5429016	5432417	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com I did see a couple emails in there already.
5432737	5436078	I'll save those for Jamie next Sunday's show.
5436439	5439359	It's 10 o'clock on the West Coast and I know it's like 1am for you guys on the East Coast.
5439640	5441180	So we want to wrap up here pretty soon.
5441820	5444561	So we'll do Mailbag more on next week's show.
5445081	5446862	But I do want to see if we can get one more call in.
5446942	5450163	So 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
5450904	5456313	Before we get to whatever call comes in, any other news that came out this week we want to get to?
5457729	5460791	There's a new game from Techland that they announced.
5460891	5462653	It's a zombie free-running game.
5462673	5466316	It looks like Mirror's Edge crossed with Dead Island.
5467577	5468018	Looks neat.
5469959	5470460	It's 2014.
5470780	5477086	Also, I know that there was some Amazon overseas stuff that listed Mirror's Edge 2.
5477546	5481189	I don't know if that's wishful thinking or maybe they're going to announce a new Mirror's Edge game.
5482270	5483151	Sounds good to me either way.
5483291	5484072	That would be nice.
5484893	5487615	I wonder if that's one of the 15 games.
5487955	5488256	Might be.
5488376	5488616	All right.
5488636	5489057	All right.
5489077	5490098	We do have one more call coming in.
5490138	5491719	So let's let's go to the phones and take it.
5492139	5493040	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5493060	5493381	Who's this?
5493861	5494802	Hey, this is Zappy.
5494962	5495583	Hey, Zappy.
5495603	5496063	How you doing?
5496604	5497144	I'm pretty good.
5497344	5498145	Long time no talk.
5498165	5498565	How you been?
5499446	5499827	Pretty good.
5499887	5500447	Can't complain.
5500607	5500868	Good.
5500928	5501248	All right.
5501648	5504771	So check out this Xbox one.
5504911	5505232	Yeah.
5506600	5507801	They're going to crash and burn.
5508302	5509963	This feels like Windows 8 Take 2.
5511284	5511924	Why do you say that?
5513025	5515307	Well, first of all, they're building it off Windows.
5515327	5525835	They were talking at the conference about using the Windows kernel and they're putting that little snapping thing on the side because what you want to be doing while you're playing a game is using the internet or whatever.
5525995	5527917	Sure, maybe for FAQs, but...
5528958	5537265	I will say that is one thing we didn't see at the press conference that I did expect to see more of is that we didn't really see any type of like, this is how it works with your PC.
5537986	5542009	We did see the tablet thing, but they didn't say it was specific to Windows Phone or Windows Tablet.
5542550	5545232	They implied it would work with iPads, but they don't want to say that.
5546313	5549295	We didn't see as much of that as I thought we would.
5549536	5551778	Not a single mention of Windows 8 that I recall.
5552598	5555721	Yeah, like they only said Windows kernel, which could mean anything.
5555741	5557502	They could even have Metro apps.
5557843	5558343	Who knows?
5559424	5564948	But what seemed like most interesting was the Skype looked exactly like it looked in Windows 8.
5567450	5571934	Yeah, well, you know, I understand, though, that they want to keep like a similar look and feel and what have you.
5571974	5575517	I thought that's why they have their kernels so they can run the Windows 8 apps.
5576858	5579260	I mean, why else would you have three kernels on that goddamn thing?
5580479	5608558	they also have 8 cores to be playing around with so they gotta be doing something with it you know that makes me think that it would be so easy to make games for Xbox One because you know you can make the games in Windows or whatever and then I go oh yeah one thing we didn't touch on earlier in the show they're not gonna let Indies self-publish it's the one platform where Indies are not gonna be able to self-publish I don't think they've said anything yet about that but didn't they say they were gonna have something they were backpedaling yeah okay so they're backpedaling on somebody's way too soon comment alright fair enough
5609638	5616303	The one thing that scared me about the Skyping is I get to the nice ending of Halo 5 and, oh, I got a Skype call completely ruining the ending for me.
5618185	5620686	Well, you can set your Skype to do not disturb, right?
5621507	5624129	Hopefully, but half the time I probably wouldn't remember.
5624369	5625830	Yeah, yeah.
5625910	5629653	Also, that made me think that maybe the true next generation is the Steam Box.
5631034	5634717	Is that where you think you might go with gaming right now?
5635441	5640964	Yeah, a nice little box that plugs into my TV, fully backwards compatible with all the games I bought before.
5641224	5642765	It's starting to seem really appealing.
5643805	5645986	But is there anything Microsoft could do to win you over?
5646026	5652310	I've talked with a lot of the previous callers about that one game that's going to get you to just go back on everything you said.
5652810	5654891	Is there something out there that might do that for you?
5656161	5656942	I don't think so.
5657182	5658203	I've been thinking about it.
5658223	5667233	Like, Sony has a lot more exclusives than I'd want to be playing that might maybe backfill, but Microsoft, like, Gears of War isn't exactly this killer game I need to play.
5667333	5670097	It's fun, but it's not the game I need.
5670137	5672019	So I don't think there's anything Microsoft can do.
5672880	5673080	Hmm.
5674662	5676443	Well, and there's going to be some people that are like that.
5676463	5684548	There's just like, you know what, there's really nothing, and I certainly know people like that, there's really nothing Microsoft has to offer that's going to convince me to get the console.
5684808	5688230	What about other, are you currently a Wii U owner at all?
5689951	5694614	Like, I saw it at Costco for $200 for the core unit, and I still couldn't bring myself to buy it.
5695134	5695534	Wow.
5696435	5700417	Because there just is no games, and there's none coming out on the horizon.
5700477	5701558	What, Wind Waker?
5701758	5703159	I played that for the billionth time.
5703942	5706063	Well, to be fair, wait for E3, you never know.
5706103	5714367	I mean, I don't think you should buy a console in anticipation of games six months from now, but, you know, there might be something that'll make you go, okay, I gotta start saving up for the holiday.
5715447	5719029	I don't know, Nintendo needs to be having their E3 conference, so that doesn't give a lot of faith.
5719429	5720490	What about PlayStation 4?
5722110	5723831	I'm mildly optimistic.
5724431	5731555	It's so far what they've shown me, but it's good, but I haven't seen much of it because they just showed off a couple of early games.
5731955	5732115	Hmm.
5732868	5762112	probably not in 2013 because Killzone isn't selling me on a console anything else you want to share with the listeners before I let you go or wrap up the show that's it good to hear from you, take care you too later that's going to do it for our calls tonight thank you guys for calling in sorry if you wanted to call in and you didn't get through but remember you can always email your thoughts mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com any other things we want to touch on tonight Loki?
5763467	5765468	Onomatoguchi's new album is awesome.
5765888	5766429	That's what I hear.
5766449	5767670	I can't wait to check it out.
5767770	5772432	If you go kickstart it, you might find that in their updates, they have the album for you.
5772452	5773053	There you go.
5773813	5774073	Awesome.
5774614	5774874	All right.
5774934	5781758	Well, all the segments you know from the show will be back next week when we do the show again, which would be Sunday.
5782679	5784139	I got to look at the day here.
5784280	5785921	I think it's the show before E3.
5786081	5787561	No, it would be Sunday, June 2nd.
5788482	5790204	I can't wait for more next Xbox name rumors
5807634	5807894	Really?
5808695	5809336	No, I'm just kidding.
5809356	5811798	There's not going to be any because they were announcing it.
5811838	5813520	There could be peripheral cells.
5814020	5814861	There should be some.
5815562	5817203	It's going to be the Xbox 2.
5819466	5819806	All right.
5820827	5823529	Well, before we close up shop tonight, do you have any final thoughts, Loki?
5825485	5832893	Yeah, so VOG game night's going to be tomorrow night now, which will be Friday if you're listening to this on the podcast.
5832913	5833814	So you're too late.
5834715	5835235	Not necessarily.
5835255	5836336	I'm going to put the podcast up tonight.
5836877	5837457	So Friday.
5837718	5842723	Friday around 8 to 8.30 because we usually let Josh stay up a little later on Fridays.
5843684	5844364	Team Fortress 2.
5844765	5844985	Nice.
5845826	5847107	Free, so go check it out.
5849454	5849734	I don't know.
5849814	5852015	I've never played it, so we'll be interested.
5852375	5854036	I'm going to try to make it this time.
5854176	5854896	See, I don't know.
5854956	5858997	I'm going to have to have someone hold my hand here as far as setting up games and stuff because I have no fucking clue.
5859017	5860898	Like I said, I've never, ever played the game.
5860918	5862018	Talk to Actdeft.
5862038	5863019	He's pretty seasoned in the game.
5863059	5864199	Maybe he can host or something.
5864219	5865179	He's on the fog list.
5865219	5866040	So we'll do that.
5866200	5875503	And then I was still thinking maybe I actually might move it to Friday nights going forward because I think it's easier for people to stay up later, especially on the East Coast because it's weekend.
5877984	5883865	and maybe not this week but I have all the stuff to start recording so we'll be streaming that hopefully soon.
5883965	5888306	Actually, if you guys are doing Team Fortress 2, I should be able to stream that tomorrow on the Orange Lounge Radio channel.
5888346	5888847	Yeah, it's PC.
5888907	5890527	I can stream on PC so that'll be fun.
5891067	5891487	Alright, cool.
5891827	5893568	Alright, well, I guess that's going to do it.
5893608	5895748	Thank you guys very much for supporting independent podcasting.
5895788	5897609	I know this wasn't one of our regular shows.
5897969	5904871	DarkSakura wasn't here for one and we didn't do our regular segments but if you enjoyed our little banter and you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show because there's plenty more
5905231	5908732	and more to come.
5909733	5921057	Your word of mouth and helping to spread word of the show is what keeps us afloat because we don't have the resources to raise thousands and thousands of dollars to promote and buy ads and so forth.
5921837	5923358	Thank you guys very much for supporting the show.
5923878	5926759	Leave us a nice word on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or whatever.
5927440	5931325	and thanks for listening to us talk about Xbox One for a little while.
5931585	5932726	We want to hear your voices too.
5932766	5935330	Don't forget the mailbag, Twitter, Facebook and all that good stuff.
5935891	5939696	So we'll see you back here on June 2nd, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern for another live show.
5939996	5940837	Have a great night everybody.
