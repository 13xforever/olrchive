360000	368000	DarkSakura Chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster says, I thought I saw a tweet where someone wanted to pre-order an Xbox One and the GameStop employee said they don't sell those anymore.
368000	386000	I saw that same tweet. Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says, indeed at least with Playstation 4 people are like, oh it's the new one. Sony just kinda, you know, they took the easy way out but it really works, right? Sony's thing works.
386000	404000	Well I thought the whole idea with calling it the 360 was kinda weird in the first place. I mean it's just, we're used to it now but it's just kinda like, I don't know. You tried going the direction and so now you're going back to the way you were so you made a full 360.
404000	421000	Going back to a classic time for the Xbox, sorry about that. Live Radio. Gotta love it. Let's see, S2100Matt says, I don't even think GameStop sells old Xboxes anymore. No, that's true. BlackWolf says, Xbone for the Call of Duty dog. That could be the name of the dog.
421000	430000	BlackWolf continues on, if the name didn't kill the Wii, the name won't kill the Xbone. I agree, it won't. It is just, you know, interesting.
430000	443000	Alright, so first things first, they get out there and they're talking television, you can watch The Price is Right and you can do this thing with your hands with the Kinect where you make it bigger, make it smaller.
443000	447000	Like, Xbox, go to Star Wars or whatever. No, Star Trek.
447000	458000	Well, the very first thing they show, they show that you can sign on using your voice and it would recognize you. Kind of like what it's supposed to do on the Xbox 360 which doesn't work too well.
458000	470000	It does not work too well. I hate to be pessimistic but it constantly confuses me for Alan. We don't sound that much alike and just because we both have facial hair beards doesn't mean...
470000	488000	I understand tech's a lot better now, so whatever. And then they showed them navigating the interface using swipes of the hand and stuff and then they have this thing where you can basically dock stuff to the side of the screen like you can on Windows 8 or I think even Windows 7 you can do that stuff.
488000	493000	And so now you can Skype with people while you watch a movie.
494000	509000	Well, I actually find that feature to be one of the more interesting features because I remember when Netflix used to be, well it's still on 360, but it used to have that party mode where you could actually have everybody on the headset and kind of like talk during a movie.
509000	516000	There was a lot of people that were really into that and were kind of pissed when it disappeared and I don't even think to today we really fully understand why that disappeared.
516000	522000	It was probably that, you know, it's something we're going to get into later on.
522000	532000	So party chat, not okay, but Skyping, okay. Although I would think maybe you can't Skype during Netflix because that might be too much bandwidth. I don't know.
532000	533000	You probably still can.
533000	544000	You could probably do at least Skyping while watching a movie, but does that mean you can be synced up with the other... did they get into that? That you and your friend, you know, overseas can be watching the exact same thing, like synced up at the same moment?
544000	545000	I don't know about that.
545000	549000	I thought they had touched on that a little bit, like that they could watch the movie together or whatever. I thought they said that.
549000	557000	I don't know. But here's the thing. It's like they were showing they could bring up Internet Explorer on the side and then you navigate it using your phone.
557000	574000	Or I could just go on my phone and use the browser on there instead of having to use... launch the app for Xbox, you know, Smart Glass and use that as, you know, it's just... it's unnecessary. It really is.
574000	581000	See, I'm going to be honest, though, is that... and this is just me and my preferences, is that I don't really watch a lot of TV.
581000	582000	No, me neither.
582000	594000	So when I look at features like that, I'm kind of meh. You know, there's a... I've been catching up on a few things on Netflix, but like live TV, there's very little that I watch anymore. Very, very rare.
595000	604000	Now, I admit being able to have a Skype party during RuPaul's Drag Race sounds really exciting, but I mean, I don't know if it's something I would get a lot of use out of.
604000	606000	Even with an iPad. You could do that right now.
606000	607000	That's true. That's true.
607000	619000	I mean, it's just... it's a neat idea, but it's just not... I don't think it's something that people are going to use a lot. It's just like, hey, look, Twitter and Facebook are part of Xbox.
619000	620000	Mm-hmm.
620000	628000	Fuck, did anyone use that? No. Once. Hey, look how I'm tweeting from my Xbox. Done. I mean, that was it.
628000	638000	But I do get the idea, you know, obviously... well, to take a few steps back, everything that went on in this conference was very much what we predicted it would be.
638000	649000	And, to be fair, what a lot of people predicted it would be, based on comments from Microsoft themselves, is that it was going to be mostly talk about why it's an entertainment box, and there's going to be very little focus on games.
649000	654000	Yeah, I mean, that's exactly how it turned out. E3's like in a couple weeks. Right. Not a shocker there.
654000	663000	Fifteen games. At E3, apparently. Which is... that's not bad. How many of them are going to get delayed?
663000	675000	Well, in fifteen, here's... and also on top of that, fifteen games, not necessarily retail releases, because now they're considering Xbox Live Arcade and indie games games.
675000	680000	They're just calling everything games now to make it even harder to find shit. I don't know.
680000	690000	But I wasn't that disappointed that they didn't show anything. In fact, the one new property they showed from Remedy or whatever, it made no fucking sense.
690000	699000	They could have just shown nothing and said, hey, new game from Remedy, and people would be like, oh, sweet, instead of like... Quantum Break is the name of it. Quantum Break, yeah, okay.
699000	705000	I don't really need, you know... I don't know. It just... it looked weird.
705000	712000	I thought it was interesting that it mixed the live action with kind of a throwback to PC CD-ROM to get the taste.
712000	718000	I don't think that that's actually gameplay. I think that's just the trailer. I just think that... I don't think it was actually part of it.
718000	726000	Yeah, but I was... okay. I liked Alan Wake a lot. I think it was really underrated by a lot of people.
726000	729000	By the way, the weekly deal on Humble Bundle.
729000	735000	Yeah, seriously. If you've never played Alan Wake or you don't own it, you need to get in on this Humble Bundle. Just tangent. Great.
735000	744000	Anyway, our chat room is lighting up, of course, as you would think, for a topic that's been as hot-button in the gaming community as the Xbox One.
744000	751000	Tigerclaw says, the one good thing about this conference was that Microsoft actually showed the console, unlike Sony, who just talked about it.
751000	757000	Well, that seems to have been a mixed bag for them. Let's talk about the look for a little bit. You know, the console's look.
757000	763000	A lot of people on Twitter I'm seeing going, this thing looks like a Betamax VCR. It's kind of dumpy.
763000	764000	Who cares?
764000	771000	Yeah, I have to... I'm kind of with you. Like, I think people put way too much stock in what the box looks like.
771000	774000	What does a PC look like? Oh, is that sexy? No, it's a box. Who cares?
774000	777000	Well, some people go all out on the cases and the lights and the smoke.
777000	781000	Okay, I understand that. You can still do that. You can still add smoke lights and whatever.
781000	783000	You can put My Little Pony stickers all over the Xbox if you want.
783000	790000	I mean, I don't really care. I mean, who cares if the case is all nice and routed? You know what a rounded case means? I can't fucking stand it up on its end.
790000	798000	Now, granted, this thing is like the size of a VCR, so you probably don't want to stack that thing on its end, but who cares? As long as it's well-ventilated, I don't care.
798000	807000	I'll tell you what was exciting about the way it looks and what have you, which, you know, I'm not... I like that they went minimalist with it. I'll give them that.
807000	814000	You know, it's a very minimalist look, and I think that's fine. If the thing is just going to sit on your shelf, you know, it doesn't need to be flashy and all that.
814000	824000	And they showed, like, when they were making it and stuff, they're like, okay, here's the system, here's the drive, here's the chip, here's that fucking huge-ass heat sink and a giant goddamn fan on top of it.
824000	832000	This shit will not over... Oh, and by the way, half of the console is a vent, and the other half is more vents. It's like, I don't think it's going to be a problem.
832000	837000	Yeah, and actually, the thing that excited me most that they said about it was that it's silent. Yay!
837000	838000	Or pretty close to it, yeah.
838000	846000	Because the old 360s, oh my gosh, those things are... Like, I still have one of the earlier model 360s, and that thing, it still sounds like a freight truck when you turn it on.
846000	855000	Like, it's really loud and noticeable. So, to me, that was the most exciting part. I don't care what it looks like, just shut the hell up when I'm trying to watch a movie, right?
855000	861000	DungeonBuster in chat says, I'm just hoping it doesn't have the same hardware issues the 360 did early on.
861000	876000	No, I mean, we're talking, like, how many advancements in chips have there been? It's running such a... Was it a 28... It was a 28-watt chip or a 28-nanometer chip now? I mean, they're really low-watted chips now.
876000	885000	I'm a valid concern, in my opinion, with how bad that Red Ring affected people, and not just that, but there's been a lot of tiny little stumbles along the way for Microsoft.
885000	897000	I'm not trying to, like, just, like, you know, pee all over them or whatever, but, you know, the reality is Xbox Live got broken in two somehow, and a ton of people had money stolen, including me with their live accounts or whatever.
897000	913000	I personally had two Xboxes that Red Ring and had to be sent back. You know, there was those issues, and I understand Sony has issues, Nintendo has issues too. I haven't personally experienced any of them. Those consoles still run like rocks. My PlayStation 2 is still flawless, pretty much.
913000	927000	So, I think it's a valid concern. Now, I'm optimistic that Microsoft's learned and so forth, and I don't think we need to necessarily hold the past against them, but I understand where the concern comes from.
927000	934000	It's been a while. I did like the new controller.
934000	937000	Yeah, I was gonna get into that next. The controller. What'd you think?
937000	947000	I liked the idea of having, like, actual rumble in the triggers. I think that's kind of a neat innovation, I guess. It looks like they fixed the D-pad, so that's good.
947000	948000	Thank God.
948000	966000	Everything else is pretty much the same. Battery compartments integrated inside the controller, which at first was like, oh, sweet, built-in battery like the PlayStation 3, but no. No, it's actually, it's, you know, a compartment where you can put AA batteries and stuff, so I'm a little disappointed about that, because those batteries die so fast.
966000	970000	I just was hoping it would be more integrated, but maybe they keep the cost down or something.
970000	979000	Maybe. Yeah, you would think that they would kind of have taken the charge idea from the PlayStation 3. I mean, it's so freaking convenient with the mini-USB. It's, I love that.
979000	991000	Yeah, so that's a little disappointing, but I mean, it looks nice. I don't have a problem with, you know, how it's, you know, it's a little bit bigger now, but whatever. It's not that big a deal.
992000	1006000	Now, I did not remember hearing this when I was watching the press conference. This is one of those things that came out after the press conferences, a lot did, but what's this whole thing? It's supposed to measure your vitality, like the Wii Vitality sensor, the heartbeat thing is in the controller?
1006000	1015000	No, the Kinect sensor can do that, because it's that sensitive, because it can actually see your heart rate based on, like, your veins pulsing on your face. Yeah, it's that detailed now.
1015000	1025000	That's, well, the skeptic in me is wondering about that, because, you know, I thought this first Kinect was supposed to do so much and be so accurate.
1025000	1030000	That Kinect sucks. I'm selling mine, by the way, so I'm getting rid of mine.
1030000	1038000	Yeah, but I'm just, I'm just kind of like, I don't know, there's a skeptic in me that's like, I like to play video games in the dark. It's going to see my heartbeat in the dark.
1038000	1039000	It's infrared.
1039000	1042000	It can still see all, that's just, that's crazy.
1042000	1050000	It's infrared, and remember, now they have the new technology, it was a time of flight with, you know, the photons where it measures the actual distance and stuff with that.
1050000	1060000	I think that's all great and stuff, but I don't like what they're doing with it, and a lot of this tinfoil hat stuff starts making me wonder, because think about it.
1060000	1070000	They have this new technology now that's the time of flight stuff, so it's going to look at, you know, it's not going to just recognize you based on a picture, it's recognizing you based on like a 3D image of yourself.
1070000	1082000	So, and remember, they patented something a while ago where it was going to be able to enforce like, was it the public screen things, the movies, or whatever.
1082000	1089000	So if like you have like a bunch of people in your house and you're watching a movie, it's like, oh, nope, sorry, too many people watching this movie at the same time type thing, you know.
1089000	1091000	No, they would not do that.
1091000	1103000	They have a patent for it, why would you get a patent for that? I'm just saying, it's not necessarily something that they will implement, but, and then also I worry too that, like say for example you're sharing your login with a friend or something like that.
1103000	1110000	Hey, you can log in on my account and play my game, it's going to look at your face, I'm sorry you don't look like that person, sorry, not going to let you log in.
1110000	1116000	I'm worried that that's going to, that they're going to try to do that, lock it down somehow, so that you can't account.
1116000	1120000	But people change, you know, what if I want to shave my beard off?
1120000	1126000	But it's not going to look at your beard, it's probably going to look at proportions, like proportions between your eyes, between your lips.
1126000	1128000	What if I lose a ton of weight?
1128000	1130000	I don't know, I don't know how it's going to work.
1130000	1132000	Or gain a ton of weight the way I'm going.
1133000	1145000	I'm just saying that, you know, I'm very, I'm very worst case scenario with them, because I don't, especially after the whole rumor, and I don't even know what's going on with this now,
1145000	1152000	because everyone's contradicting everyone else about the whole not playing used games, well not necessarily, it plays used games, okay?
1152000	1157000	Basically, all the games that you play have to be installed to the hard drive, fine?
1157000	1163000	Let me take a step back for a minute, because all this came out after the conference, so let's take a step back, finish up, we'll win out of the conference,
1163000	1167000	and then, because that's a very important point, is that there's a lot that came out that wasn't even set on stage.
1167000	1173000	Yeah, the conference was awesome, like after the conference, before I heard any other information, I'm like, yeah, this is pretty awesome, I have to get one of these.
1173000	1182000	So, let's see, some of the stuff they showed that was game-wise, fours of five, expected, part of the course, looks nice.
1182000	1184000	Quantum Break, I think we already talked about.
1184000	1186000	EA Sports Partnership.
1187000	1194000	Well, they are going to be big sellers, it was interesting to see EA get out there on stage and pledge their full support to Xbox,
1194000	1200000	I think I said something on the last show about that too, where, you know, they did that for Wii U and then totally just, you know,
1200000	1206000	turned around and went to go to bed with their new buddy Microsoft, which is kind of funny, the way that all played out.
1206000	1211000	Which only made the news after the show more, yeah, we kind of figured that was going to happen.
1212000	1218000	And then Call of Duty Ghosts, which, I'm not so big on that series, but you are, so what did you think?
1218000	1224000	I didn't really understand, like it didn't really make any sense to me, it wasn't like, no, I mean honestly, it's just like,
1224000	1231000	you know, Black Ops 2 looked pretty awesome with all the drones and stuff, and that kind of, you know, that was something that made me kind of excited about the game.
1231000	1238000	This one doesn't really, other than, okay, stuff's kind of post-apocalyptic a little bit, and there's a dog.
1238000	1245000	Like, I didn't really get what it was about, so I don't really understand. The dog thing I think is kind of neat,
1245000	1252000	but, once again, you know, I'm not going to be pure mulanode over this crap, I'm not going to be like,
1252000	1258000	oh hey, I gotta get fabled because there's a fucking dog in it, and wait, the dog's kind of annoying.
1258000	1264000	It's like, I don't know, I don't think it's going to be that big a deal, and they're going to fucking kill the thing off,
1264000	1267000	you know they're going to kill the dog off, they always kill the dog off.
1267000	1273000	Or, if it's not this game, it's going to be in like a game or two next, you know, they're going to kill that dog.
1273000	1276000	Something's going to happen to that dog, that dog is not long for this world.
1276000	1279000	Save the dog! Hashtag save the dog.
1279000	1288000	Alright, um, let's see, one of the other big things, sorry, I'm distracted because I see something in chat here,
1288000	1291000	Alan says, earthquake in Sacramento, is there a joke, is that a joke?
1291000	1298000	I did not feel an earthquake if there was just an earthquake, I don't know, anyway, the joys of live radio.
1298000	1306000	One of the other big things I wanted to bring up that they talked about on stage was the Halo TV series.
1306000	1311000	So, now it's no longer a movie we're talking about, it's a TV series we're talking about.
1312000	1315000	So, Steven Spielberg, executive producing.
1315000	1316000	That could be good to me.
1316000	1322000	They had that gal on stage that used to be with CBS and all that, I remember hearing that they had hired her
1322000	1326000	and she was going to be working with the Xbox, you know, content delivery.
1326000	1333000	I was surprised we actually didn't hear more about that whole thing, and I'm not necessarily talking about the Halo TV show.
1334000	1341000	In talking with some people, it seemed a little unclear at first, is this something that's going to be on TV,
1341000	1346000	is this something that's going to be a Netflix Hulu thing, but I think, you know, going back and watching it later when I did,
1346000	1352000	it seemed pretty clear to me that they are going to launch some type of video on demand service,
1352000	1358000	which, well, I mean, they already have a video on demand service, but Xbox original programming or something is going to be built into that,
1358000	1364000	and this Halo would obviously be a huge staple in that, with Steven Spielberg's name on it.
1364000	1369000	Steven Spielberg, his TV series, especially the ones that have been on, I think he had some on Showtime or HBO
1369000	1375000	or something like that, like the Band of Brothers, I think, was one of his, are really good.
1375000	1385000	I mean, they're really good war dramas, so, I mean, assuming that it's treated nice, maybe not so much like that,
1385000	1391000	was it the, what the fuck was that, Forward on to Dawn, Forward on to Dawn was kind of cheesy,
1391000	1395000	but, you know, assuming it's better than that, I think it could be pretty awesome.
1395000	1398000	Am I going to watch it? Probably not.
1398000	1400000	What if you have to pay for it, though?
1400000	1402000	Nope, definitely not going to watch it then.
1402000	1403000	Huh.
1403000	1410000	I just, I'm not a huge fan of Halo, I just, I'm not going to seek out this TV show, it doesn't really appeal to me.
1411000	1416000	It's neat, though, that they're, you know, they're going to talk about doing something like that.
1416000	1418000	What else might they be working on, you think?
1418000	1426000	Um, maybe some more, like, Xbox-centric news shows, because remember they used to have, like,
1426000	1430000	a bunch of, like, their kind of community blog stuff, almost, on there.
1430000	1435000	Like, I think they even had some with, like, Major Nelson, and that's, I don't know if that's still there or not.
1436000	1438000	But, maybe something like that?
1438000	1442000	I'm not really sure if they would have any more TV shows based on their properties.
1442000	1448000	I don't think I'd want to watch another, like, you know, maybe if we do, like, a Steven Spielberg Halo thing,
1448000	1451000	we can do, like, a Michael Bay Gears of War or something, you know?
1451000	1454000	Or a Michael Bay Crackdown, that would be awesome.
1454000	1456000	Is this something to enhance Xbox Live, possibly?
1456000	1461000	Like, this will just be, if you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber, it's a free thing for you.
1461000	1462000	Maybe.
1462000	1463000	Maybe.
1464000	1470000	Uh, by the way, not to get derailed by this, but yes, there was just a 5.9 earthquake up by Susanville,
1470000	1474000	which is a ways away, that's like, you know, three hours north, but I guess they're feeling it.
1474000	1477000	I didn't feel it! What's up with that?
1478000	1479000	Weird.
1480000	1484000	Alright, thanks for derailing the show, earthquake, what are you trying to say?
1484000	1485000	Oh, man.
1485000	1487000	Don't do a show on Thursdays.
1487000	1492000	Um, okay, so, did that pretty much cover everything, at least from the press conference itself, I think so?
1492000	1499000	Um, yeah, and then of course they said, you know, was it 15 games or something?
1499000	1503000	Yeah, which we mentioned a little bit ago, which, you know, more to come at E3.
1503000	1504000	Yeah.
1504000	1509000	So, um, so that leads us to everything that started to come out after the fact,
1509000	1512000	which just started to get weirder and weirder.
1512000	1520000	Um, one of the big things that came out right off the bat is that the Xbox One will not be backwards compatible with Xbox 360.
1520000	1525000	You will not be able to play the games, you will not be able to play the download games,
1525000	1528000	and assumably that includes XNA and what have you.
1528000	1529000	I'm not surprised.
1529000	1536000	And, uh, it will, however, be cross, or backwards compatible, if you will, with any videos that you've bought.
1536000	1537000	Yeah, that makes sense.
1537000	1538000	Music that you've bought, and so on.
1538000	1546000	Obviously, this ties into the fact that the Xbox One is using a new chipset, which the PlayStation 4 is doing the same thing.
1546000	1551000	Although, on the PlayStation 4 side, you kind of go, well, use the Gaikai thing to make some magic happen.
1551000	1556000	But they're not necessarily, they're going to offer that later on, but it's not going to be like,
1556000	1559000	hey, you bought this title, now you get this game free. I don't think it's going to be like that.
1559000	1560000	Right.
1560000	1563000	It would be nice. It's not going to happen that way, but it would be nice.
1563000	1568000	So there will be no backwards compatibility, which, you know, I realized that most of the,
1568000	1573000	you know, PlayStation 3 wasn't backwards compatible, Xbox 360 had limited backwards compatibility.
1573000	1579000	Well, the PlayStation 3 originally started backwards compatible, but, you know, then it slowly went away.
1579000	1580000	Yeah, that's true, that's true.
1580000	1587000	It's harder to create a system with, you know, you can't, they don't have an Xbox 360 on a chip right now.
1587000	1588000	Right.
1588000	1591000	And to, you know, do that, it's just going to be hard to emulate that.
1591000	1595000	You're basically creating an emulator for this thing, and it's going to be difficult to do that.
1595000	1598000	Do you think that decision is going to hurt, though?
1598000	1599000	No.
1600000	1608000	I'm kind of with you because, I mean, PlayStation 4 is in the same boat, so it's not like one does it and the other doesn't.
1608000	1615000	But I just think the odd, or the thing to be concerned about is that, you know, again, this year, at the end of the year,
1615000	1620000	when these consoles are launching, you still have a lot of good stuff coming out for the current gen.
1620000	1621000	Yeah.
1621000	1623000	And people that buy that stuff aren't going to be able to play it on the new consoles.
1623000	1630000	And here's the thing, too, like, you know, don't think that you have to buy one of these new consoles right at launch.
1630000	1638000	I mean, I kind of want to, but I'm not really forcing myself to do that because, once again, any of these games that I want to play,
1638000	1645000	like, say, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5, only on, you know, the current gen stuff, you know, but other stuff like Assassin's Creed 4,
1646000	1652000	Battlefield 4, Call of Duty, you know, all that stuff is going to be also on current gen.
1652000	1657000	Or even if you want to go further, Destiny is going to be on current gen as well.
1657000	1659000	Was it Watch Dogs current gen?
1659000	1666000	So I don't need to buy a new console to play these awesome games. I can just wait.
1666000	1673000	And let's be honest, the new consoles that come out that have these games on them and then also have them on the current gen,
1673000	1675000	they're not going to be that drastically different.
1675000	1680000	I mean, hell, they've shown gameplay from, like, the PlayStation 4 of Assassin's Creed 4.
1680000	1683000	I can't tell the difference between that and the PS3 version.
1683000	1686000	Apparently there's some better physics. I can't tell the difference.
1686000	1688000	So, I don't know.
1688000	1693000	And let's assume, you know, these games are still coming out at $60.
1693000	1698000	So are they going to price the PlayStation 4 and, you know, Xbox One games the same thing?
1698000	1701000	I don't think so. I'd be surprised if they're the same price.
1701000	1704000	If anything, I think they're going to be, like, $69.
1704000	1710000	Although, I have been receiving some temporary pricing from Ubisoft.
1710000	1713000	It shows $99, but there's no way.
1713000	1721000	I have a feeling the MSRP for, you know, games, I think that maybe hasn't been determined yet.
1721000	1722000	I don't think so either.
1722000	1731000	I tend to think they're not going to bump up the ceiling simply because they're making extra money on collector's editions and DLC.
1731000	1734000	But, I mean, I could be wrong, of course.
1734000	1742000	But I kind of think it would be a very slippery slope if they were to bump it up to $69.99.
1742000	1745000	They're already talking about, was it, Battlefield 4.
1745000	1752000	They already announced the pre-order DLC campaign that's going to be added on already.
1752000	1757000	And, you know, the comment is like, why don't you just include that in the regular game then?
1757000	1763000	If you're already announcing this and it's already being worked on, why is this not being included in the game?
1763000	1764000	Right.
1764000	1765000	Yeah.
1765000	1768000	Okay, then the biggie.
1768000	1770000	And this is the one that everybody's talking about.
1770000	1775000	And I'm not even sure I can make sense of what the hell is happening with this news.
1775000	1780000	Microsoft's not giving a clear answer on it and they pretty much have said that they won't until E3.
1780000	1790000	And I think this whole thing started with a post and surprise that, you know, this came from Kotaku that started a crazy wave over the internet.
1790000	1791000	No, it wasn't Kotaku.
1791000	1796000	Well, I'm thinking of that interview that they had with Phil Harrison, right?
1796000	1805000	It started with Wired Magazine got the exclusive interview or whatever with Microsoft about their Xbox One console.
1805000	1810000	They were the first to have everything and then it kind of spun off from their people asking follow-up questions about that.
1810000	1811000	Okay.
1811000	1822000	So, they first, it talked about how the console will play used games but will require you to pay a fee in order to use that disc a second time.
1822000	1827000	So, that, it just, okay.
1827000	1838000	First off, I don't know even if this is going to happen because they keep going back on it and, you know, the Xbox support Twitter saying no, it's completely wrong.
1838000	1839000	We're trying to get them to remove that story.
1839000	1840000	It's completely inaccurate.
1840000	1842000	Yeah, a quote from the Xbox support account.
1842000	1848000	I understand your concerns but can confirm that any information for fees for used games is incorrect.
1849000	1858000	So, I don't know if, and a lot of these people asking the same question to these guys, they're phrasing it in a very careful way.
1858000	1866000	You know, when they're asking about can I go to my friend's house and, you know, play my copy of a game.
1866000	1869000	They're like, yes, you can go to your friend's house and play your copy of the game.
1869000	1874000	You can install it to their drive but you have to log into your account to do that.
1874000	1876000	You can't just loan them the game.
1876000	1883000	So, what they're, what's happening right now is basically it sounds like every game is going to have a code that comes with it, kind of like the online pass.
1883000	1888000	Basically, that code is going to lock that game to your system.
1888000	1894000	So, you install it, you give them the authentication code and then you can play the game without the disk anymore.
1894000	1896000	The disk is basically you don't need it.
1896000	1901000	Now, what they haven't explained is what happens when you give that disk to your friend and they don't have a code.
1901000	1905000	Now, originally they said, okay, you're going to have to pay full price.
1905000	1911000	And this is coming from an interview from higher up saying this, that you're going to have to pay the full price of the game to play it on your system.
1911000	1916000	Now, I took that as you're going to have to pay the full price to play that game on your system without a disk.
1916000	1922000	I don't understand why they can't do it, you know, okay, you can play the game off the disk.
1922000	1929000	But I understand why they're doing that is because, you know, I could buy it, load it on my system, play without a disk, give it to my friend, he plays with the disk.
1929000	1932000	You get two games for the price, one basically, so they can't do it that way.
1932000	1937000	And I think I'm hearing something about the installation is being done because Blu-ray drives are too slow.
1937000	1943000	Yes and no. I mean, yes, I understand that they're, you know, but that's fine.
1943000	1947000	Forced installation is fine, then why do we need the one time use code?
1947000	1952000	If that's DRM, that's all it is, it's DRM, it's not...
1952000	1957000	I understand the drive is slow and that you can force that, but you know what?
1957000	1963000	Right now I have my Xbox 360, I install games to the hard drive and the disk is in the drive.
1963000	1967000	It reads the disk for a little bit to authenticate that you have the disk, then it runs it off the hard drive.
1967000	1970000	Why can't we do it the same way? I don't understand why we can't do it the same way.
1970000	1976000	Because they want DRM. They want the DRM in there because there's hacked drive firmwares.
1976000	1981000	They don't want to even mess with the hacked drive firmwares, they're going to, you know, nip that in the butt right away.
1981000	1986000	Why wouldn't there necessarily be hacked things that will dodge the authentication servers?
1986000	1987000	Hackers going to hack, right?
1987000	1990000	I understand that, but right now they're treating you as pirates.
1990000	1993000	That's how they're treating you out of the gate. They're treating you as a pirate.
1993000	1996000	Because they're putting this extra piece of DRM in the way.
1996000	1999000	I got to put a code in now that, you know, play my game.
1999000	2003000	And see, what they haven't explained right now is that how are you going to revoke that if you...
2003000	2005000	They said they're supporting used games, okay?
2005000	2010000	Let's pretend that this is actually a one time use code like it is with the online passes.
2010000	2014000	Then when I sell it to GameStop, as this current scenario is right...
2014000	2018000	As they're explaining right now, and granted this is going to change at a drop of a dime.
2018000	2020000	I sell this back to GameStop.
2020000	2022000	Why are they going to buy it for me first off?
2022000	2026000	Because if anybody takes that game and tries to install it, it's going to ask them for 60 bucks.
2026000	2033000	So, you know, you're essentially killing used games even though you can pass it off to a friend and they can install it for the full price.
2033000	2040000	So, there's got to be something in the way of where you can revoke your, you know, license or whatever on that.
2040000	2045000	But, once again, that's going to require that code because unless there's a code somehow on that disk...
2045000	2049000	And I don't know how that would even be accomplished because...
2049000	2053000	I don't even know. It doesn't even make sense how that would even be accomplished.
2053000	2057000	Unless there's like some RFID tag or something like that, which can be faked.
2057000	2059000	You could fake that.
2059000	2064000	If it is tied to that code and I lose that code, then how... Is that disk useless now?
2064000	2068000	I can't use that disk because I don't have the code to install it? I don't understand how it's going to work.
2068000	2071000	I want to go back to something that was said through an official channel.
2071000	2075000	And this was on majornelson.com and he's, you know, kind of the mouthpiece for Microsoft.
2075000	2084000	And during all this, you know, craziness about the used games, he released a statement on his blog that says, quote...
2084000	2091000	We know there is some confusion around used games on Xbox One and wanted to provide a bit of clarification on exactly what we've confirmed today.
2091000	2100000	While there have been many potential scenarios discussed, today we have only confirmed that we designed Xbox One to enable our customers to trade in and resell games at retail.
2100000	2104000	So you will be able to use GameStop somehow in this.
2104000	2109000	Okay, yeah. I understand that they have it so that you can trade in your games and resell it.
2109000	2112000	But if it's worthless, I mean, hell, you can, you know, if it's...
2112000	2116000	Yeah, but I don't think you say that if it's worthless. Like, there's something there.
2116000	2120000	Yeah, so there's something there, but it doesn't make any sense that it has to be this complicated.
2120000	2125000	Make it as easily... Why can't it be the same as it is now? I don't understand why they have to do that.
2125000	2131000	Oh, I know why. It's because they got pressured by EA to do this. How do you think they got their silly little EA partnership?
2131000	2134000	Oh, it's because they fucking implemented this shit.
2134000	2136000	Hold on, though. Let me play devil's advocate for a minute.
2136000	2142000	Now, Tim trips in our chat and says there are a lot of other really good reasons to play off a hard drive besides DRM.
2142000	2146000	And one thing I can think of, you know, you might... Hold on, hold on.
2146000	2152000	One thing I can think of is that on the 360, there have been problems when some people use the disc,
2152000	2156000	some people install to the drive, and sometimes one is too slow, one is too fast.
2156000	2160000	You know, there were problems when people were installing certain games and so forth.
2160000	2163000	So this is kind of one way to level that playing field.
2163000	2166000	I have no problem with installing to the hard drive. I think that's a great idea.
2166000	2171000	I install all my games to the hard drive anyways because, yes, that drive is loud, it's slow.
2171000	2174000	That's fine. I have no problem with that. I have the problem with the one-time use code.
2174000	2175000	That is my problem right there.
2175000	2181000	Yeah, but then how... I can understand how do you stop, you install it, and then I take it to my friends, they install it.
2181000	2186000	It requires the disc and the drive. Just like it is now. Require the disc and the drive. There you go.
2186000	2190000	It doesn't have to... It just spins it to check that it's there, and that's it.
2190000	2192000	I don't understand why it has to be any more complicated than that.
2192000	2195000	They're making it complicated because they're fucking treating it...
2195000	2198000	Didn't you just say that somebody's worked around that system on 360?
2198000	2202000	Yeah, they've worked around it and they patched it, but you know what?
2202000	2204000	It's a different story now. We're talking a new console.
2204000	2208000	And assume that everybody is... I mean, not everybody is doing that.
2208000	2212000	We're talking about people that are pirating games, a small minority are doing this.
2212000	2215000	And you're treating everybody like a pirate.
2216000	2221000	I'll agree with you to the extent that if a small minority figured out a way to work the system now,
2221000	2223000	that same small minority is going to figure out a way to work the system then.
2223000	2225000	They're going to figure out a way. Yes.
2225000	2228000	So, I'll meet you to that point.
2230000	2233000	Let me read the rest of Major Nelson's statement.
2233000	2235000	Beyond that, we have not confirmed any specific scenarios.
2235000	2239000	Quote, another piece of clarification around playing games at a friend's house.
2239000	2244000	Should you choose to play your game at your friend's house, there is no fee to play that game,
2244000	2246000	while you are signed into your profile.
2246000	2248000	That was the end of the statement.
2248000	2251000	Well, yeah, there's a lot there that's unsaid.
2251000	2253000	It's kind of like, you read the inverse of that.
2253000	2257000	They're treating all games as a digital download.
2257000	2262000	But whether you're digitally downloading it off the disk or downloading it off the internet.
2262000	2267000	The problem with that is, I like that you want to treat it like this,
2267000	2270000	and this is very idealistic of Microsoft to think this way,
2270000	2272000	but that's not how the fucking world works.
2272000	2275000	It's a goddamn physical disk.
2275000	2280000	If I'm downloading it off the internet, yes, I can't sell that used because it's a digital copy.
2280000	2283000	It's a physical copy. I'm holding it in my hand.
2283000	2285000	It is a disk.
2285000	2289000	That's why a lot of people like to do physical copies.
2289000	2293000	Especially when you're talking about $60 or $70 a game,
2293000	2297000	some people like to have that equity where they know they can sell it later.
2297000	2301000	There are a lot of people that buy games full price and then sell them for whatever,
2301000	2304000	you know, nickels and dimes they can get to get some of their money back when they beat it.
2304000	2306000	Exactly. And here's my thing, it's like,
2306000	2310000	it's very idealistic of them to think that they can pull that off right now.
2310000	2313000	You know what? Maybe you should wait another decade or so
2313000	2316000	where the infrastructure's in place to where that actually is a thing
2316000	2319000	where you can download games and it's very effortlessly.
2319000	2323000	But right now, it's not there.
2323000	2327000	And you can't think that you can pull this off if...
2327000	2330000	I'm sorry, it's just you can't do this.
2330000	2332000	They're gonna try to do this, but you know what?
2332000	2334000	If not everyone is on board, it's not gonna work.
2334000	2336000	And if PlayStation 4 is on, and you better believe,
2336000	2338000	PlayStation 4 is probably thinking the same thing,
2338000	2340000	but they're like, you know what?
2340000	2343000	We may have made this deal before, but we're not sure if we're gonna do this.
2343000	2346000	And I was reading this in chat earlier and I apologize,
2346000	2348000	I don't remember the specific names of the people saying this,
2348000	2350000	but some people were talking about PlayStation 4
2350000	2354000	and could Sony actually have this exact same system in place,
2354000	2357000	but they're letting Microsoft take the heat for it?
2357000	2361000	Don't get me wrong, I think that both companies met together
2361000	2364000	and agreed on something, and I think EA started it.
2364000	2367000	Tinfoil hat, if you will.
2367000	2370000	Because I think that that is why...
2370000	2374000	EA wouldn't just drop it if one company was doing it.
2374000	2378000	They would say, okay, yeah, we're not doing it on the 360 or the Xbox One,
2378000	2381000	but we're gonna do it on PlayStation 4.
2381000	2384000	So everybody's on board with this because that's the only way it's gonna work.
2384000	2386000	They're not counting Nintendo because Nintendo doesn't...
2386000	2389000	It's just, you know, whatever. It doesn't even matter.
2389000	2393000	It's so small, it's no big deal to them.
2393000	2395000	So they're all on board with this.
2395000	2398000	However, I could see one of them or both of them backing out of it
2398000	2400000	because of the backlash of it.
2400000	2403000	I have to go here now, and a lot of people in our chat room,
2403000	2406000	starting with Slidekick, are going here too,
2406000	2409000	is about, well, isn't this interesting now?
2409000	2413000	Let's say your little tinfoil hat, you know, locked boardroom,
2413000	2417000	locked boardroom scenario, EA sat Sony and Microsoft down
2417000	2419000	to mutually agree on this or whatever.
2419000	2422000	Who has EA recently apparently turned their back on? Nintendo.
2422000	2425000	Doesn't this put the Wii U in this really interesting situation now
2425000	2428000	where none of this fuckery exists there?
2428000	2432000	And despite all this talk about, you know,
2432000	2435000	where the Wii U is in this horrible place and da-da-da-da-da,
2435000	2441000	suddenly the Wii U has got the system we all want.
2441000	2444000	To be able to trade games and rent games?
2444000	2446000	No, here's the thing, though. Here's the thing.
2446000	2449000	It's like, you don't have to do any of this.
2449000	2452000	Hello? You don't have to buy any systems.
2452000	2454000	You don't have to pick one of the three consoles.
2454000	2457000	It's not like, make your choice, you know, and that's it.
2457000	2459000	You've got tons of choices. You can go PC.
2459000	2461000	You can keep the consoles you have now,
2461000	2464000	because I'll bet you they're going to keep supporting those consoles
2464000	2466000	if no one's buying the new ones.
2466000	2468000	And, you know, like I said, if you want to buy the Wii U,
2468000	2471000	cool, buy the Wii U, but I don't think that all of a sudden,
2471000	2474000	for me, why would I buy the same console
2474000	2476000	that generates pretty much the same type of graphics
2476000	2478000	as, you know, I'm not gaining,
2478000	2481000	there's nothing really to gain for me from the Wii U.
2481000	2483000	But I'm just saying that why,
2483000	2486000	you don't have to buy these new consoles, that's the thing.
2486000	2488000	It's like, I don't have to put up with this bullshit.
2488000	2490000	You want to go ahead and try to implement all this stuff
2490000	2491000	where I can't sell games?
2491000	2493000	Hey, you know what, I can't sell games on Steam either,
2493000	2496000	but here's the thing, Steam drops the price of their games
2496000	2499000	very frequently, and I get some really good deals,
2499000	2502000	and I buy games that if on console,
2502000	2505000	you know, I probably wouldn't be picking up those games.
2505000	2508000	I can honestly say, you know, I get the Steam comparison
2508000	2511000	and there's this little meme that's on Twitter that I saw somewhere
2511000	2515000	that says, you know, Xbox One announces that used games
2515000	2518000	or new games are tied to one account, internet gets crazy,
2518000	2520000	Steam games are tied to one account,
2520000	2522000	everybody loves Valveheart, you know, type of thing.
2522000	2524000	And, you know, although I get the point there,
2524000	2526000	I'm thinking back myself personally,
2526000	2530000	I have never bought a game on Steam for $60
2530000	2532000	that was digital distribution only.
2532000	2537000	I have bought PC games where I had the little disk in my hand for $60,
2537000	2542000	you know, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, you know, whatever.
2542000	2544000	You know, I've bought PC games that way,
2544000	2548000	but I've never done digital distribution on a game that wasn't on a cheap sale.
2548000	2550000	And I've talked about this on an older OLR.
2551000	2555000	I said there's gonna be, if, and again, this is all probably hysteria anyway,
2555000	2557000	we don't really fucking know what's happening,
2557000	2560000	but there's gotta be some give here.
2560000	2564000	If you're gonna tell people that their games are going to lose equity
2564000	2567000	and you're not gonna have that same resale value,
2567000	2570000	then you need to make the price of a new game cheaper.
2570000	2571000	Something's gotta give.
2571000	2573000	That's why people love Steam,
2573000	2576000	because Steam makes games a heck of a lot cheaper.
2576000	2578000	Exactly, like I bought, was it?
2578000	2583000	I just bought a Sonic bundle with, you know, like 12 games in it for $20.
2583000	2586000	It's just, it's that cheap impulse buy.
2586000	2592000	You don't see Microsoft and Sony marking down their games by like 60% or something.
2592000	2594000	It's just not gonna happen.
2594000	2597000	So what makes you think it's gonna all of a sudden start happening
2597000	2598000	when they lock everything?
2598000	2600000	You know, let's say we live in this perfect world now
2600000	2603000	where we have the bandwidth to download these games digitally
2603000	2605000	and they decide, hey, you know what?
2605000	2607000	We're gonna go, we're gonna do everything digital.
2607000	2610000	Do you really think they're gonna have the same type of sales as Steam does?
2610000	2612000	No, of course not.
2612000	2614000	It's just like how on the PlayStation Network,
2614000	2616000	how you can get like PlayStation portable games
2616000	2621000	that are more expensive on, you know, the digital store than they are at retail.
2621000	2624000	Osfernchat says, I like the point someone made earlier
2624000	2627000	that while we should be used to tied accounts on PC,
2627000	2632000	that was something we didn't have to deal with for consoles and it was nice.
2632000	2636000	Captain Spike says, not to prove EA right about Steam devaluing games,
2636000	2639000	but aside the very rare new release once or twice a year,
2639000	2643000	I don't buy anything on Steam that's more than like 20 bucks.
2643000	2646000	But do you hear those companies complaining?
2646000	2650000	Those companies have already made back their money a lot of times on these games
2650000	2652000	and now they're just dropping prices.
2652000	2653000	It's extra sales for them.
2653000	2655000	I mean, they're not printing discs.
2655000	2657000	It's just digital copy.
2657000	2660000	It costs nothing for them to manufacture that.
2660000	2663000	I want to get to one more comment from Major Nelson's blog.
2663000	2666000	He did a chat with Yahoo, which, God,
2666000	2668000	Yahoo is like everywhere in the news all of a sudden
2668000	2671000	with the whole Tumblr and everything else they've been buying.
2671000	2673000	But anyway, Major Nelson was on Yahoo
2673000	2678000	and the very first question thrown at him in the Yahoo chat is about used games.
2678000	2681000	Larry, could you please provide some more clarity
2681000	2684000	as to how users will be able to play used games on Xbox One?
2684000	2685000	Here's the response.
2685000	2688000	We are still months away from the launch of Xbox One
2688000	2690000	and policy decisions are still being finalized.
2690000	2695000	So, that being said, do we need to just sit down
2695000	2699000	and fucking wait for E3 for more information to come out on this?
2699000	2702000	Is the internet going too crazy with this shit?
2702000	2704000	No, I think that they're going the adequate amount of crazy.
2704000	2706000	In fact, crazier would be better because you know why?
2706000	2710000	It sends a message to them that, listen, people are concerned about this
2710000	2714000	and this will actually affect their decision to purchase your console.
2714000	2718000	If people just sat back and like, eh, whatever, it's not a big deal,
2718000	2720000	then they're going to keep up with it.
2720000	2722000	That's why all this stuff needs to be.
2722000	2723000	They need to be hounded.
2723000	2726000	Every goddamn press conference or every time that you see these guys
2726000	2728000	that you have an interview with them or whatever,
2728000	2731000	you need to bring this shit up so that it's fresh in their mind
2731000	2733000	that people are still concerned about it.
2733000	2734000	That is the thing.
2734000	2736000	We need to keep doing that because otherwise they're just going to assume
2736000	2738000	that we don't care and they're going to do whatever they want.
2738000	2742000	Well, you reminded me of one big thing they talked about at the press conference
2742000	2746000	that we didn't talk about earlier, and that's the Azure Cloud,
2746000	2748000	or Blue Cloud, Windows Blue, haha.
2748000	2750000	So they have the cloud, right?
2750000	2753000	And they're talking about that they can do processing on the cloud
2753000	2755000	and that's something you can do in games.
2755000	2758000	What is this, something like 300,000 servers functioning, da-da-da?
2758000	2762000	And of course this makes people think in their mind, isn't this what SimCity?
2762000	2768000	So Xbox One is going to have, you could put SimCity on Xbox One.
2768000	2771000	I think they're just saying it's something that they can implement
2771000	2773000	that anybody can do that.
2773000	2775000	They can have an online-only game.
2775000	2778000	That's up to the decision to the developer and the publisher.
2778000	2783000	So yeah, cool, they're offering this for developers to use if they need to.
2783000	2785000	I'm fine with that because you know what?
2785000	2788000	I'll figure out which games those are and I just won't play them
2788000	2790000	if that's an issue for me.
2790000	2795000	So I just don't, I don't know.
2795000	2798000	Would this be a deal breaker for you?
2798000	2799000	Yes.
2799000	2802000	If they implement this not to your satisfaction,
2802000	2804000	are you writing off this console completely?
2804000	2810000	Even if it has Killer Instinct, Grand Theft Auto 6,
2810000	2812000	the games that you really want to have?
2812000	2814000	Yes.
2814000	2817000	Because I don't want to mess with this bullshit.
2817000	2819000	I don't want to mess with this bullshit on PC.
2819000	2822000	I'll build a new PC.
2822000	2825000	Or I will play the backlog of games I'm going to have.
2825000	2828000	Besides Grand Theft Auto 5, who knows?
2828000	2832000	Whenever Grand Theft Auto 6 comes out four or five years from now,
2832000	2835000	I'm sure all this stuff will be ironed out already.
2835000	2838000	All right, let's talk about one other thing that had the internet a bit in a tizzy,
2838000	2840000	and that's the always online thing.
2840000	2844000	Speaking of things that got the internet into a lot of rabble rabble talking,
2844000	2846000	whatever, right?
2846000	2847000	That guy got fired.
2847000	2849000	Yeah, I love how all these rumors are like,
2849000	2851000	there's no way, like I was even saying,
2851000	2854000	there's no fucking way that they'd pull this shit off because they can't
2854000	2859000	because they're going to hurt themselves if Sony's not on board with this stuff.
2859000	2861000	And in a nutshell, it appears,
2861000	2863000	and I don't think we really have a clear answer,
2863000	2865000	I don't think they've really clarified this,
2865000	2868000	I think this again came from one of them Kotaku interviews
2868000	2870000	that turned into a headline,
2870000	2877000	but what I'm understanding is that you will not need to be constantly connected to the internet,
2877000	2881000	but approximately once every 24 hours your Xbox needs to touch base with home
2881000	2885000	to update the programming guide information and all that,
2885000	2889000	but it might need, again, we don't know, they haven't really said,
2889000	2892000	it might impact the game transaction,
2892000	2897000	especially if you are having to lock and unlock codes and so forth,
2897000	2899000	that may be a part of this too,
2899000	2901000	where you need to be connected once every 24 hours,
2901000	2905000	or your one may not let you do what you want to do.
2905000	2906000	See, that's what I was thinking,
2906000	2908000	well, that's what I was hoping that they would do,
2908000	2912000	ideally is that you would have that one time use code,
2912000	2914000	and if you use that, then yes,
2914000	2916000	you have to authenticate with the server
2916000	2920000	so that you can run that game without a disk once you install it.
2920000	2922000	You'd have to authenticate it for the installation,
2922000	2924000	and it's tied to your account, so be it,
2924000	2927000	just like if you downloaded an Xbox Live Arcade game.
2927000	2931000	But if you don't have that, or if you can't authenticate it,
2931000	2934000	you'd still be able to play the game as long as the disk is in the drive.
2934000	2936000	That was my hope, because that makes sense to me,
2936000	2938000	it's simple, easy, we can do that.
2938000	2940000	But they're not going to have it that way,
2940000	2942000	no, they want, once again, they're treating you like a pirate,
2942000	2947000	they want to make sure that that shit is not somehow pirated onto your system,
2947000	2949000	and they're going to check it once every 24 hours.
2949000	2952000	And I don't buy it to update their fucking channel guide,
2952000	2954000	because you know what, I'm not going to be using it for TV,
2954000	2956000	because as of right now, I can't.
2956000	2958000	I don't have a cable box, I have a TV,
2958000	2960000	the coax cable goes inside,
2960000	2964000	and I use my tuner to use the open QAM channels.
2964000	2968000	So I can't, I can't do that.
2968000	2970000	Oh, but you can actually,
2970000	2972000	you just have to buy a separate piece of hardware,
2972000	2974000	so fuck them for that.
2974000	2978000	Well, I mean, I'm going to cut a little slack here,
2978000	2981000	because it's not like we didn't change at some point
2981000	2986000	from the coaxial plugin to the RCA switches,
2986000	2989000	because Atari 2600, you had to have coaxial,
2989000	2991000	then you get into Nintendo NES,
2991000	2993000	you can do that with an RF switch,
2993000	2996000	or you can do the red-yellow plugs, red-yellow-white plugs,
2996000	2999000	and then that turns into composite years later,
2999000	3000000	now we're at HDMI.
3000000	3005000	I can't exactly fault the logical steps we're taking in,
3005000	3007000	you know, input clarity.
3007000	3012000	I don't have anything to output HDMI into my console,
3012000	3014000	that's what I'm saying.
3014000	3017000	And yes, I do think it's a fucking ridiculous thing
3017000	3022000	that they have where the console does not have component support.
3022000	3024000	The PlayStation 4 does,
3024000	3027000	so I don't know why they can't do it here.
3027000	3031000	Vogkauf in our chat room, turn your head and Vogkauf,
3031000	3034000	says, Sky, what's the difference between Xbox One's
3034000	3038000	every 24-hour authentication and Steam's authentication?
3038000	3043000	Fair question, but I guess one thing I think of, too,
3043000	3047000	is that, okay, well, in order to use Steam in the first place,
3047000	3049000	you had to be on the internet.
3049000	3053000	So, logically, you have an internet connection because you got Steam,
3053000	3056000	whereas I don't necessarily need to be on the internet
3056000	3057000	to pick up an Xbox One game.
3057000	3060000	I can walk into a GameStop and get that.
3060000	3064000	And, you know, again, the thing people most commonly cite,
3064000	3067000	military bases don't always have an internet connection.
3067000	3068000	A lot of them do, though.
3068000	3070000	But one of my friends is on the military
3070000	3072000	and he doesn't post on Facebook all day long.
3072000	3077000	But, you know, granted, others don't necessarily have that connection.
3077000	3081000	But they can still get the PC games mailed to them and so forth,
3081000	3083000	but that wasn't through Steam.
3083000	3086000	So, I mean, that's, I guess, the key difference,
3086000	3089000	is that in order to get that Steam game in the first place,
3089000	3090000	you had to be on the internet.
3090000	3092000	So, clearly, you have an internet connection.
3092000	3097000	Whereas with Xbox One, if that's the only way to do it, to play the game,
3097000	3101000	it is a little bit different than necessarily PC gaming.
3103000	3104000	I honestly, I don't know,
3104000	3106000	I haven't really had a problem with internet.
3106000	3110000	I've been places without internet at, you know, my work or whatever,
3110000	3112000	and still play my Steam games just fine.
3112000	3114000	But, you know, I do connect.
3114000	3116000	I have internet at home and stuff.
3116000	3120000	So, I haven't really been without internet for a long span of time,
3120000	3123000	but I don't really know how Steam treats that.
3123000	3125000	So, I can't really say.
3125000	3128000	I do know that they have an offline mode.
3128000	3130000	Now, I'm not really sure how that works either, but...
3130000	3132000	Yeah, some people in chat are talking about offline mode right now.
3132000	3133000	So...
3133000	3134000	And it works fine.
3136000	3138000	I don't know. I would trust...
3138000	3141000	It just doesn't seem that bad on Steam,
3141000	3143000	but then again, everything's digital on Steam.
3143000	3144000	Everything is digital,
3144000	3146000	and yes, I understand that they're using the excuse that,
3146000	3149000	okay, you're just digitally downloading off a disk.
3149000	3151000	However you want to fucking word that.
3151000	3153000	You know, that's ridiculous.
3155000	3157000	I just don't know.
3157000	3159000	I just don't like the fact that
3159000	3163000	game companies still treat everybody as a licensed user
3163000	3167000	instead of you own this like I own a car.
3167000	3168000	I'm not a licensed user of a car.
3168000	3170000	Well, but judging from the internet reaction,
3170000	3175000	some people are basing their decision on this console on that.
3175000	3176000	You know what I mean?
3176000	3178000	Like, if this used thing pans out to be true,
3178000	3179000	I don't...
3179000	3181000	There's a lot of people on the internet that are...
3181000	3183000	Well, right now, like I said...
3183000	3184000	And you might say,
3184000	3186000	angry fanboys, da-da-da-da-da,
3186000	3190000	but, you know, every one of those comments is coming from a potential buyer.
3190000	3192000	I haven't made any firm decisions about any console yet,
3192000	3193000	so, you know, whatever.
3193000	3196000	And I don't think anybody should until at least E3,
3196000	3197000	because to be fair, again,
3197000	3199000	we don't know the answers to this, necessarily.
3199000	3201000	We're having to read between the lines on a lot of this.
3201000	3202000	And on top of that...
3202000	3203000	Microsoft needs to make it crystal clear.
3203000	3204000	And on top of that...
3204000	3205000	So does Sony.
3205000	3206000	We need to see what games are coming,
3206000	3207000	because...
3207000	3208000	I don't know.
3208000	3210000	Forza 5 is kind of cool,
3210000	3212000	but do I need a console for that?
3212000	3213000	Nope.
3213000	3214000	I mean...
3214000	3216000	The one that's going to be tough?
3216000	3217000	Killer Instinct.
3217000	3218000	I'm going to be...
3218000	3220000	And we hear rumblings that,
3220000	3223000	yes, Rare is reviving a historic IP from Rare,
3223000	3226000	and granted, that could be one of a couple other games, too,
3226000	3227000	like Conker or something,
3227000	3228000	but, you know, a lot of people,
3228000	3229000	based on earlier leaks,
3229000	3230000	they're like,
3230000	3232000	it's going to be Killer Instinct.
3232000	3234000	That's going to be fucking rad.
3234000	3235000	They got that trademark.
3235000	3237000	You know, it makes a lot of sense.
3237000	3240000	That's going to be a hard one to say no to, right?
3240000	3241000	Yeah.
3241000	3243000	Well, actually, no.
3243000	3244000	Not for me,
3244000	3246000	because I never was a fan of Killer Instinct.
3246000	3247000	Oh, get out.
3247000	3248000	All right.
3249000	3252000	Although Crackdown, Crackdown 3,
3252000	3255000	which there is a rumor that it's going to be one of the games
3255000	3259000	because they had the little orb icon on their dashboard
3259000	3260000	during their presentation.
3260000	3261000	Ooh.
3261000	3262000	That might...
3262000	3264000	I may have to get in on that.
3264000	3265000	All right.
3265000	3267000	One other thing I want to mention about the hardware
3267000	3271000	and the Always Online in this is the whole Kinect.
3271000	3275000	So the Kinect, apparently, has to be plugged in.
3275000	3276000	You have to have that.
3276000	3279000	Again, I don't know if this is coming directly from Microsoft
3279000	3280000	or where this came from.
3280000	3283000	Do you know where we ended up at this conclusion,
3283000	3285000	that the Kinect always has to be plugged in?
3285000	3287000	I think it was one of the after-interview things.
3287000	3289000	I understand why it has to be,
3289000	3292000	because once again, it's just games being installed on the hard drive.
3292000	3295000	They have to assume that you have it so they can use it.
3295000	3300000	They can't just program it so that you don't have it.
3300000	3302000	Although, I mean,
3302000	3304000	it would be nice to assume that you have it,
3304000	3308000	and then if the game doesn't use it, maybe just not...
3308000	3309000	Well, no, actually,
3309000	3311000	because you're still going to have to use it in your face.
3311000	3312000	It'd be cool if you turned that off,
3312000	3313000	and if a game needs it,
3313000	3316000	it would be like a controller's unplugged or something.
3316000	3317000	Here's the thing.
3317000	3319000	And this is causing a lot of people...
3319000	3323000	Like, somebody on Twitter was saying that they had heard Glenn Beck,
3323000	3325000	which I'm so sorry that you had to hear that,
3325000	3328000	but maybe it was people that were listening to Glenn Beck or whatever
3328000	3330000	that apparently they were talking about this on a show the other day
3330000	3332000	about the conspiracy theories
3332000	3336000	about how the Kinect is how the government is going to spy on us in our homes,
3336000	3337000	and all this.
3337000	3339000	I think, you know, and...
3339000	3341000	Which was totally the plot of an episode of Scandal.
3341000	3344000	I'm sorry, but this is going to, once again, out me
3344000	3347000	that I still read Kotaku occasionally.
3347000	3351000	Sorry, it's a hard habit to break, but...
3351000	3353000	You like trash, just admit it.
3353000	3354000	I have...
3354000	3356000	Listen, I fully understand...
3356000	3357000	Sometimes you find...
3357000	3358000	No, it's not that I'm...
3358000	3360000	Cans in the garbage, you can go recycle.
3360000	3362000	I'm entertained by what they're posting,
3362000	3367000	because honestly, I hold Polygon to the same level of garbage
3367000	3369000	in their postings, so...
3369000	3373000	I like to have the full picture, and I read everything.
3373000	3376000	And even if that means reading the same story like five times.
3376000	3379000	But they actually, one of their posts on there were
3379000	3383000	they were trying to get people to send messages to Fox News
3383000	3386000	because they wanted to run the whole campaign of
3386000	3389000	the Xbox One doesn't let our troops play games.
3389000	3391000	Oh, fuck that!
3391000	3393000	Because, you know, you...
3393000	3396000	Okay, so when Fox News decides to go on something,
3396000	3400000	some crazy-ass tangent that Mass Effect has crazy lesbian sex
3400000	3402000	and is corrupting our kids or whatever,
3402000	3405000	you know, you want to tear them down, but then,
3405000	3408000	oh, now it's suddenly convenient, we might need them to be a mouthpiece
3408000	3411000	to, you know, get on the gaming companies, like...
3411000	3413000	Go...
3414000	3417000	Get a new hobby, for fuck's sake.
3419000	3421000	And there's some questions in chat.
3421000	3423000	Polygon is garbage? Yes. I'm sorry.
3423000	3425000	I don't agree, by the way.
3425000	3427000	That's Loki's opinion, not mine.
3427000	3429000	That's my opinion. I'm sorry, let me change that review
3429000	3431000	five more times.
3431000	3434000	Actually, it isn't trash anymore. I think it's great.
3434000	3437000	Oh, nope, trash again. Nope, it's great.
3437000	3439000	Anyway, that's not what this episode's about.
3439000	3441000	Alright, here's what I wanted to say about the Always On Connect.
3441000	3444000	So, my assumption is, one of the reasons it needs to do that
3444000	3446000	is because, you know, to walk into your house and say like,
3446000	3448000	Xbox, turn on, and all this.
3448000	3450000	But now after what you said about the hole at once
3450000	3452000	to see how many people are in the room to watch a movie,
3452000	3454000	like, I kinda can't help but go, God, that's weird.
3454000	3456000	But... How are you gonna stop that?
3456000	3458000	Blocking it? They're gonna say something's blocking...
3458000	3461000	Why not? Why can't I just turn my connect around,
3461000	3463000	face the wall, and cover the mic?
3463000	3465000	Because they'll be like, where are you?
3465000	3467000	Then if the system does...
3467000	3470000	I'm gonna be honest. I am gonna be perfectly honest.
3470000	3472000	If that's how the system's gonna work,
3472000	3476000	that almost concerns me more than the used game hubble-oo thing.
3476000	3481000	Like, sometimes, guys, I like to, when I get home,
3481000	3486000	take off my pants, then sit down on the couch and play some video games.
3486000	3488000	And I don't necessarily need a camera on me,
3488000	3491000	showing what I look like down there in the corner or whatever,
3491000	3492000	when I'm doing that.
3492000	3494000	What if you get a quick Skype call?
3494000	3496000	What if I accidentally leave Skype open or, you know,
3496000	3498000	heaven forbid, the voice command, you know,
3498000	3501000	Xbox, broadcast live on Twitch?
3501000	3503000	I don't know what happens, you know?
3503000	3506000	I don't really want that.
3506000	3508000	That's stupid, bitch. Launching Twitch.
3508000	3512000	Yes, something like that. Exactly, right?
3512000	3518000	Now, I realize they're talking about these privacy settings and so forth,
3518000	3522000	but again, you're asking me to just fucking trust you.
3522000	3525000	One cool thing we forgot to mention is they're gonna have the same,
3525000	3528000	not really sharing feature, but it's gonna record your gameplay
3528000	3530000	and you can edit it with an editor and stuff.
3530000	3533000	That's kinda cool.
3533000	3538000	Yeah, but I just, you know, again, I don't need Connect to always be watching.
3538000	3541000	I just don't like that, yeah, it's always on stuff.
3541000	3543000	And here's the other thing, too, is it doesn't really serve me that well,
3543000	3548000	because I take my console, although, here's the thing,
3548000	3551000	I can't do that anymore, actually, now that I think of it,
3551000	3554000	because I take my console, well, I'd have to get another cable.
3554000	3559000	Set up again. I take my console and my game on a monitor that has DVI in.
3559000	3562000	I guess I have my DVI cables now, but whatever.
3562000	3567000	If I didn't have those cables, it only has DVI in or VGA in.
3567000	3571000	I can't do that because, see, I have all these wonderful cables for my Xbox 360.
3571000	3574000	I have a VGA cable that made it, it was fantastic.
3574000	3579000	But now that I got rid of that multi-AV port, I'm stuck with fucking HDMI.
3579000	3583000	Yes, I know, I could buy a brand new monitor that has HDMI in,
3583000	3587000	but why am I going to fucking spend more money to play a game system that I've got to buy also?
3587000	3592000	That's also going to have more expensive games. Why do I want to do that?
3592000	3597000	VogCoff in our chat room brings up another story that kind of ties into the whole Kinect thing.
3597000	3603000	Rob, all the voice commands being demoed on the Xbox One affected all Kinect users on 360,
3603000	3607000	stopping streams and such. I'm sure you've read about that,
3607000	3612000	where people that were watching the streams on the 360, the voice commands were fucking with the plug-in.
3612000	3615000	It's even worse than that, like actual stuff on TV.
3615000	3620000	Like, they were showing someone watching an episode of The Cleveland Show,
3620000	3623000	and it was saying something about their, like, stop.
3623000	3628000	You know, I'm going to stop that, and it kept stopping his stream when he was playing it,
3628000	3631000	and the only way he could do it was mute it to get past it.
3631000	3634000	So, like, if my Kinect is plugged in, think about it.
3634000	3638000	Somebody on live television could get up there and just yell into the microphone,
3639000	3644000	That's the old Kinect. The old Kinect doesn't determine, it only listens to sound.
3644000	3649000	The new Kinect is actually going to see you, and it's going to know which person is saying that, allegedly.
3649000	3652000	Unless, of course, you could mime it, and then someone else yells it out.
3652000	3654000	In which case, it probably wouldn't know.
3654000	3656000	But, I don't know. They're going to have a way around that.
3656000	3659000	It's more sophisticated now.
3659000	3663000	Alright, I think that covers most of the bases.
3663000	3667000	There's a few other stories that came out after the Xbox One.
3667000	3673000	Some things on a positive note, certainly, is that they're talking about a 1 versus 100 style game for Xbox One.
3673000	3678000	Not at launch, but certainly within the opportunity for the future.
3678000	3680000	And that doesn't necessarily mean it will be 1 versus 100.
3680000	3684000	But you know I never shut up about how great that was, and that it died way too soon on 360.
3684000	3689000	So I'm really excited that they are talking about bringing back that type of idea on Xbox One.
3689000	3692000	That would certainly make the system a lot more attractive.
3692000	3696000	Some YouTubes out there that are skewering the press conference a little bit,
3696000	3702000	one of them just repeats TV, TV, TV, Call of Duty, Call of Duty, Call of Duty, and sports, sports, sports, over and over again.
3702000	3708000	I don't think that those videos are as hilarious as the PlayStation 3 press conference a few years ago.
3708000	3712000	No, they had the same guy did it, and his was kind of funny.
3712000	3715000	But at the same time, you know, I didn't hate the press conference.
3715000	3720000	The press conference they had was exactly the type of stuff I expected.
3720000	3724000	It's everything that came out after the fact on the internet that's causing the concern.
3724000	3726000	The press conference itself was fine.
3726000	3728000	I had no problem with the press conference.
3728000	3730000	Yeah, it was literally all the information.
3730000	3733000	After the press conference I was like, I guess I'm going to have to get an Xbox One.
3733000	3737000	And then after the press conference I was like, not with this information though.
3737000	3744000	Alright, any other news type things that we need to bring up that you think we might have missed somewhere along the line?
3744000	3751000	PlayStation 4 is teasing the reveal of their console.
3751000	3753000	Yeah, I saw it the day before. It was funny.
3753000	3754000	Yeah, so.
3754000	3757000	We're going to open up the Skype line in a moment if you guys want to call in.
3757000	3760000	1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
3760000	3766000	Again, that is if you are here with us live on Thursday night, May 23rd, 2013.
3766000	3770000	If you're hearing the rebroadcast on Sunday, we're actually not here.
3770000	3774000	We took Memorial Day weekend off, but we'll rebroadcast this on Sunday night.
3774000	3778000	We are going to open that up in just a moment, and we'll talk about some of the other news this week during that time.
3778000	3784000	But before I go to the phones and ask people where their head is at on the 360, or, whoops, Xbox One.
3784000	3786000	It's going to take me some time to get used to that.
3786000	3793000	I want to kind of ask you, Loki, where are you at right now with Xbox One?
3793000	3795000	I just need to figure out what they're doing.
3795000	3803000	Because they're going back and forth, and I don't even know how the used game thing works and what the online only stuff is.
3803000	3807000	And that's all software anyways, so that can be changed in a drop of a hat.
3807000	3810000	So, until it comes out, we don't know.
3810000	3815000	I just hope that they kind of figure out, hey, maybe that's not a good idea to do that right now.
3815000	3817000	You know, maybe wait until next generation.
3817000	3820000	Or, you know, I don't know.
3820000	3821000	It's just like, you know, EA.
3821000	3828000	They had news this week that, oh, it's like, we're actually developing some games for the Wii U, just not as many.
3828000	3830000	I mean, so, what's to say to EA?
3830000	3836000	I mean, it wouldn't be very popular, but what's to say EA couldn't say, haha, just kidding, we're going to have online passes anyways.
3837000	3840000	We changed our minds.
3840000	3844000	They're called, like, freedom passes now.
3844000	3850000	I'm in a similar boat where it's like, you know what, it's just too soon to make a determination on Xbox One.
3850000	3854000	There are some things I like that I'm hearing, and there are some things I don't like that I'm hearing.
3854000	3859000	And back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
3859000	3864000	And although I'm interested in Quantum Break, that's not enough for me right now.
3864000	3868000	I'm very curious to see what E3 brings when they unveil these other titles.
3868000	3874000	I bet there's going to be something in there, especially if Killer Instinct is one of the games, that's something that's going to give me great pause.
3874000	3880000	But, if they screw up this use thing or the connect thing, that could be a deal breaker for me.
3880000	3884000	But I'm not going to sit here and say, oh, I'm not buying, I'm definitely not buying one now.
3884000	3889000	Because my opinion can damn well flip flop one way or the other on E3.
3889000	3893000	It's just like people going, well, I'm definitely buying a PlayStation 4 now, I'm not buying an Xbox One.
3893000	3895000	I'm like, you don't even know what the hell they're doing.
3895000	3897000	I think Sony's got a lot to say, too.
3897000	3901000	And I know we haven't been talking about them tonight, because the focus hasn't been on them this week.
3901000	3904000	But there's still a lot of questions they've got to answer, too.
3904000	3906000	Like, we don't know what they're using, you know.
3906000	3911000	I think they've said that they support used games, but once again, they say they're supporting used games here, too.
3911000	3917000	Yeah, exactly. Microsoft's able to say the same thing, so I kind of need that to be crystal clear.
3917000	3920000	So, we'll find out more.
3921000	3924000	And again, at least I know how my Wii U works.
3926000	3928000	At least you'll get some games this year for it.
3928000	3932000	You know, I got to go here with you, though, Loki, because you're one of Nintendo's biggest critics.
3932000	3939000	But I was having some Twitter conversations earlier this week, and talking about Xbox One and all the tin-hat foil theories.
3939000	3945000	Do you see a path here where Nintendo could, and I don't want to sound fanboy here,
3945000	3951000	but do you see a path here where Nintendo could walk away with this holiday season?
3951000	3953000	No.
3953000	3957000	You know why? Why? Because the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are still out there.
3957000	3968000	And I'm sorry, even if the Wii U does okay, you've still got all the really big games coming out on the current-gen consoles.
3968000	3975000	And hell, we can consider the Wii U a current-gen console, too, because it's pretty much the same as far as graphics go.
3975000	3979000	In fact, actually, it won't have Battlefield 4, so there's one strike against it.
3979000	3984000	I mean, you may not care for some people in any Zelda game. Who cares? Mario Kart, who cares?
3984000	3986000	But I don't think it's gonna...
3986000	3988000	I kind of care about Mario Kart. I think a lot of people do.
3988000	3993000	No, no, I'm saying who cares, because you have Mario Kart. That's what I'm saying.
3993000	3998000	I don't know. I don't buy all the systems from Mario Kart anyway, so who knows? Maybe we'll get a Wii U this fall.
3998000	4004000	Right? That's gonna be the hilarious thing that happens. I'm gonna laugh so fucking hard if that happens.
4004000	4006000	If Loki ends up walking out with a Wii U this holiday season.
4006000	4008000	No, I'm not. I'm not dumb enough.
4008000	4009000	Say that now.
4009000	4012000	No, I am saying that now, because Mario Kart 7 is kind of lame.
4012000	4021000	So I'm not gonna buy a system for one game, unless they have Excite Truck 2, in which case I will be buying that game.
4022000	4028000	Mario Kart, no, I'm sorry. It's not gonna be a big... Excite Truck, and if it's awesome, movie.
4028000	4033000	Black Wolf and chat bringing up a little thing that we missed. You can have more than 100 friends on Xbox One.
4033000	4034000	That's a thousand friends.
4034000	4041000	A thousand friends. That's great, but I have to express a little bit of disappointment. Why didn't they just roll that out on 360?
4041000	4049000	Wait a second. Actually, won't it have to be on 360? Because your live account's gonna be tied to the Xbox One.
4050000	4052000	So, how's that gonna work?
4052000	4053000	How's that gonna work?
4053000	4058000	If I get my friends list up to 150 on the Xbox One, what happens when I go back to my 360?
4058000	4059000	They're gonna have to fix it.
4059000	4064000	Ah, fuck you! Ah, we saw right through it. You're just trying to get us to buy another console.
4064000	4065000	Case closed.
4067000	4068000	Yeah, I guess there's gonna have to be a...
4068000	4072000	They're gonna need that extra cloud competing, you know, to figure out where your other friends are, I guess.
4072000	4076000	I don't know, or maybe only the first hundred will show up. Oh god, that would be so...
4076000	4082000	I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to give her... Only these hundred people get a rose. Everyone else will have to go home.
4083000	4087000	You're gonna have to go home and live on the Xbox One until I come back and visit you.
4089000	4095000	Alright, we're getting close to the end here of our little chat, but I do want to open it up, the Skype line, and see what you guys have to say.
4095000	4099000	So, if you are listening to us live on this Thursday night, May 23rd, go ahead and give us a call.
4099000	4102000	1-877-GAMELR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
4102000	4105000	We want to know your thoughts on Xbox One.
4106000	4111000	Some of the other news to come out from the world of gaming. Since there is no show this Sunday, I want to just throw some of these other things out here real quick.
4111000	4116000	Release date today for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn, August 27th.
4116000	4120000	Yeah, it was August. I was guessing a week earlier. I was wrong.
4120000	4124000	Oh, you were wrong. August 27th, collector edition pre-orders are already available.
4124000	4128000	Looks like it's... I'm excited about XIV Realm Reborn.
4128000	4133000	I'd be more excited if it was, you know, a pay-to-play and that was it. No monthly fee.
4133000	4136000	I would definitely buy it. I'm not going to buy it.
4136000	4143000	Who knows? Who knows? One of the last holdouts is going free-to-play in June. Rift is finally going free-to-play.
4143000	4146000	Come on, Final Fantasy XI. What the hell?
4146000	4155000	Yeah, I seriously can't think of any games that charge a monthly fee at this point besides WoW and Final Fantasy XI and XIV. Or, in the future, XIV. But anyway.
4155000	4163000	Let's see. Over on Nintendo's side, a 3D version of Altered Beast coming to the 3DS eShop in Japan.
4163000	4164000	Neat.
4164000	4171000	Did you see Mario and Wario's Crowd Farter, the little parody of Kickstarter?
4171000	4172000	Yeah, that's right.
4172000	4178000	That was some great shade. I'm sorry. I was really a fan of that, what they did there.
4178000	4183000	The whole, like, if you share on Facebook and Twitter and it gets to certain levels, they'll unlock.
4183000	4190000	And, granted, a lot of the stuff they're talking about unlocking is kind of dumb. Like, you know, backgrounds and new trailers and things like that, which is a little silly.
4190000	4197000	But I just, I really love some of the parody they did of Kickstarters with their little Crowd Farter. That was pretty funny.
4197000	4204000	Again, 1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to talk to us about the Xbox One.
4204000	4209000	EA may have backtracked a little bit on their earlier statements about the Wii U.
4209000	4210000	Yeah, that's so sweet.
4210000	4214000	This was coming from a comment from... trying to bring it up here.
4218000	4225000	This was from Jeff Brown, who is an EA spokesperson. Oh, sorry, that was the person who originally said no games in development for the Wii U currently.
4225000	4233000	Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen, quote, you know, I will ultimately let consumers vote on PlayStation versus Xbox.
4233000	4239000	You know, I think Nintendo's business was more of an extension of their last console. We are building titles for the Nintendo consoles.
4240000	4243000	But not anywhere near as many as we are for PlayStation or Xbox.
4243000	4244000	And not in 2013.
4245000	4247000	Interesting. So I wonder what it is they're doing.
4247000	4253000	There's no, they haven't announced anything. There's nothing coming, unless they do maybe a port of Need for Speed when that comes out.
4253000	4266000	Or maybe a port of whatever Star Wars project's coming up. Because, you know, if the Wii U is the, and I'm using my little quotey fingers, kiddie console, then, you know, maybe a Star Wars thing on the Wii U would make a lot of sense.
4266000	4270000	They could do a Lego Star Wars game on the other one, you know, or something like that.
4270000	4285000	I think, well, I can guarantee that they don't have, well, they don't have NCAA, they don't have FIFA, they don't have Madden, they don't have NBA Live as a Wii U title, and definitely not Battlefield.
4285000	4293000	So, so far, I don't think there's anything left this year that EA's putting out that has a Wii U title to it. They have nothing coming.
4293000	4304000	So, if it's anything, it's gonna be, you know, 2014, and maybe the next round of sports games, maybe they're gonna, maybe, I think they're gonna take a wait and see approach and see how, you know, the sales go of the console.
4304000	4315000	If it picks up in the fall, then it'll warrant them making a Wii U version. It's always what it's been. It's not been, I don't think, a personal vendetta against them or something because of any sort of draconian DRM thing.
4315000	4319000	Or tinfoil hat that they've made a pact with Microsoft.
4319000	4332000	It makes sense because everybody's doing it. It's not just EA. Everybody's not making stuff for the Wii U because they're just not selling the main consoles. It costs a lot of money to port your game over, and if you're only gonna sell, like, 100,000 copies, then it's not worth it.
4333000	4340000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, dress.
4340000	4344000	Square Enix apparently gonna be doing some E3 video shows.
4344000	4346000	Shocking! It's a video!
4347000	4354000	Well, at least they're not making everybody go and get tickets to go in the theater to just sit there and watch a bunch of trailers. At least they're not doing that, to be fair.
4354000	4356000	They should. They should make you get tickets and wait on line.
4356000	4361000	You think? That would be kind of funny. Let's go to the phones. Finally, it's lighting up. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
4362000	4363000	Hey, it's Sterlok.
4363000	4364000	Hey, Sterlok. What's up, buddy?
4365000	4369000	Not too much. Just wanted to talk about the Xbox One a little bit here.
4369000	4376000	Yeah, you had a very interesting Twitter rant earlier this week that a lot of people might not be thinking of. I don't know if you were gonna tap into that or...
4377000	4389000	Yeah, definitely. That's definitely part of it. So, yeah, well, we don't know if this is... Do we know if this is actually true or not, the whole code thing?
4390000	4404000	We don't. They are not gonna say one way or the other until E3. There's a lot of very vague... There's a lot of vague vagueness right now, so we just don't know. We have nothing but internet wank to go off of and conspiracy tinfoil hat theories.
4404000	4429000	Yeah, that's what I figured. But if they do go that route and you have to enter a code, say, on the box, like the online passes worked, that essentially means that if I want to play a new game on the Xbox One, I'm gonna have to get someone cited to enter the code for me.
4429000	4446000	And sometimes it might be a little while before someone's got the time that can do that. Like with the 360 and every other console, I can't just buy a game and pop it in the system.
4446000	4451000	We don't know if it's gonna work that way.
4452000	4462000	As a blind gamer, do you run into accessibility issues on any current-gen consoles when it comes to being able to just kinda pop in and play a new game? Do you ever have to get assistance there?
4463000	4479000	It's mostly just memorizing how the layout of the menus and stuff work. I had to kind of... And I'm gonna have to do it again probably when they update the 360's dashboard.
4480000	4489000	But it's mostly just memorizing the dashboard just to know how the hell to get to the XBLA games. That's really all it is. It's not that big of a deal.
4489000	4502000	Well, hopefully they will do some type of accessibility. I mean, I can understand why they can't spend a lot of time at their 60-minute little unveiling to talk about accessibility. But it would be nice to hear a little bit about that.
4503000	4521000	And they could do it. What a lot of people are pushing for now, and I think this argument has a little more traction now with this whole all-in-one entertainment center thing that they're trying to do.
4521000	4541000	There really should be some sort of accessibility thing built in. Because Windows 8 now has... They redid their narrator screen reader, which they've kinda always had, but it's always been sort of a joke.
4542000	4564000	But they redid it for Windows 8, and it's actually not that bad. So they could probably, if they really wanted to, do... But I think, honestly, we're just such a small market, really, that it doesn't really matter to do them. It's not really cost-effective for them to do that.
4564000	4574000	Yeah, but that's such a... I don't know, that perspective would just be so harsh. It's not cool, you know? It makes me not want to like them.
4574000	4583000	But it's just the way it is. But with the voice commands, that does alleviate some of it. With the Kinect voice commands.
4583000	4591000	I guess that's... Okay, so I guess there's a positive in there, is that, yeah, if you can kinda drive the entire console with your voice, you may not need to memorize the menus, right?
4591000	4601000	Yeah, exactly. I could just say, hey, play... I don't know, well, I can't say another XBLA game. I wanna play Guardian Heroes or something.
4601000	4603000	Yeah, yeah.
4603000	4610000	But it kinda sucks that not even XBLA games are backwards compatible. That's kind of a big downer.
4610000	4613000	Yeah, it is, but, you know, the old...
4613000	4620000	360, I can understand. That makes sense, because it's a complete... But, I don't know, XBLA games, you'd think they could figure something out.
4620000	4629000	It's the chipset. I mean, it sucks, but I'm hoping that it has long-term payoff with better games.
4629000	4635000	But, yeah, it would sure add a lot of better value if we could have the backwards compatibility, that's for sure.
4635000	4641000	Also, I wanted to bring up, I don't know if it's in the show role, but this Rare announcement.
4641000	4643000	Mm-hmm. Go ahead.
4643000	4645000	What do you guys think it's gonna be?
4646000	4655000	We touched on it earlier, and I'm pretty solid on Killer Instinct, just based on the earlier leaks, and that Microsoft rumors tend to be true.
4655000	4660000	I mean, hell, most of the rumors about this thing ended up being true, right? Pretty much.
4660000	4669000	Killer Instinct is pretty much the one thing that will guarantee me, no matter what they do with the Xbox One, that will guarantee me a purchase.
4669000	4671000	It's all about the games, isn't it?
4671000	4676000	Killer Instinct, man, anything with Killer Instinct on it, I will buy.
4676000	4681000	You'll sell these morals about codes and things like that for some more Killer Instinct.
4681000	4682000	Yes.
4682000	4684000	There's a lot of gamers that are like that.
4684000	4686000	It's one of the best fighting games ever fucking made.
4686000	4688000	Yeah, I know. Tell Loki about it.
4688000	4691000	As long as they get the original announcer back.
4691000	4692000	Mm-hmm.
4692000	4697000	They gotta get that original announcer with the c-c-c-c-cabo breaker.
4698000	4704000	Alright, uh, uh, Sturlock, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but any other, uh, last thoughts for our listeners?
4704000	4709000	Um, uh, E3 is gonna be really interesting this year.
4709000	4712000	To say the least. Alright, buddy, you take care.
4712000	4713000	Alright, you too.
4713000	4715000	Alright, bye.
4715000	4719000	Uh, now our phone's ringing a little bit more. Let's go to another call. We already have another call coming in.
4719000	4721000	Hi, Aaron Orange on the radio, who's this?
4721000	4722000	Hello, it's Shane.
4722000	4724000	Hey, Shane, how you doing?
4724000	4726000	I am fine.
4726000	4728000	Happy birthday!
4728000	4729000	Thank you.
4729000	4731000	You're listening to this little show on your birthday?
4731000	4735000	It's, like, almost midnight here, so the day's, like, pretty much over.
4735000	4738000	Oh, okay. Your 30th birthday, nonetheless.
4738000	4741000	My fifth, 25th birthday, thank you very much.
4741000	4745000	Oh, okay, Bobby Blackwolf. Alright, uh, what's on your mind? What'd you want to say tonight?
4745000	4750000	I am so excited for Final Fantasy XIV after today.
4751000	4755000	What do you want to say? Wait a minute, you didn't call in to talk about Xbox One?
4755000	4758000	Oh, who cares about that stupid system?
4758000	4764000	I, for my job, which I'm sure I've talked about what my job is, but I don't need to say it now,
4764000	4770000	but I was talking with, uh, retail people about it, um, on Wednesday.
4770000	4775000	Like, people that work at, like, maybe Target and Walmart and GameStop and all that.
4776000	4781000	Nobody had something positive to say about it. Everybody was hating on it.
4781000	4783000	Every single person I talked to.
4783000	4787000	Were they hating on the press conference or were they hating on the internet hysteria that happened afterwards?
4787000	4792000	They were hating on the details that were being said.
4792000	4799000	Nothing about what a waste of, you know, an hour that was or, um, man, everybody's up in arms on the internet.
4799000	4805000	They were like, this is the stuff that I read about that came out of that conference.
4805000	4810000	This is what I saw at the conference. I don't care about anything they said.
4810000	4816000	I was like, yeah, okay, that makes sense. Same boat as most everybody.
4818000	4822000	Uh, where, where's your head out with Xbox One right now? Is it something you think you would pick up or?
4823000	4827000	Killer Instinct can't make me pick that up. And that says a lot.
4827000	4829000	Because I love Killer Instinct.
4829000	4837000	Can't E3 still change your mind? I mean, what if it does turn out this situation with the used games and the Kinect is not as bad as we're all making it out to be?
4837000	4841000	And E3 shows us everything's just fine. Would that change your mind?
4841000	4850000	No, because before going into the press event, like, Microsoft doesn't have anything exclusive that I care enough about
4850000	4856000	that would make me want to shell out the money for a brand new VCR.
4856000	4862000	Like, I, with the other two companies, they have exclusives I care about.
4862000	4868000	Microsoft had Alan Wake, which they don't really do anything with anymore.
4868000	4873000	And Dance Central, which I'll get by. I'll get by not having Dance Central.
4873000	4882000	Who knows if it'll stay Kinect or Microsoft only or if it will go to, like, Sony's new camera-y thing. Who knows?
4882000	4896000	But those two wouldn't have been enough. And if somehow they let Rare do something cool and, like, make Killer Instinct, well, honestly, Killer Instinct 1 was fantastic and 2 was crap.
4896000	4908000	So they don't really have a great history either with that franchise. It's like the now-defunct Silicon Knights. They make one good game and everything else they make is crap.
4908000	4913000	Sorry, I'm laughing at what Alan Alchemy says in our chatroom at live.hognetwork.com.
4913000	4919000	Mass Effect 4, Caden Academy, Xbox One exclusive. Would that change your mind?
4922000	4923000	Possibly.
4923000	4924000	There we go.
4924000	4931000	Okay, if Mass Effect somehow became an exclusive there and didn't require Kinect stuff, then...
4931000	4935000	See? The right game will make you sell all your morals.
4935000	4946000	But I don't think it would be possible for it to do that because EA wants money and they're not gonna put a game like Mass Effect on one system again. They did that for Mass Effect 1.
4946000	4956000	I've seen weirder things happen in gaming. Alright, I gotta wrap up soon so we can get more calls, but I do want you to have your say on Final Fantasy XIV. So what would you like to say about Rome Reborn?
4956000	4968000	Everybody needs to watch the new trailer. It's beautiful and the box art for the collector's edition is super pretty and I am so pumped up for this game that I preordered it twice.
4968000	4971000	Why would you preorder it twice? I don't get it.
4972000	4983000	Because I want the collector's edition and I want a way to play it on PS3, but I did not want the PS3 collector's edition.
4985000	4988000	Alright. Anything else, Shane, before I let you go?
4990000	4997000	Bobby, I can talk about whatever I want when I'm on the phone, so I don't want to talk about the Xbox one.
4997000	5003000	Don't use this as a platform to yell at chatters. Go into the chatroom and yell at them that way. Alright. Take care, Shane.
5004000	5011000	Oh, he hung up on me. I hope your birthday sucks once left of it. Six minutes.
5013000	5019000	Alright. I hope you get an earthquake in the next six minutes. No, I don't. I don't mean that.
5019000	5022000	Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange is Honest Radio. Who's this?
5022000	5023000	Hey, this. Hack Def.
5023000	5025000	Hey, Hack Def. What's on your mind?
5025000	5029000	Well, talking about the Xbone or the XB1, whatever.
5029000	5030000	The Xboner, yeah.
5032000	5041000	Well, one thing most people don't, well, I think they haven't talked or thought into consideration is the price.
5041000	5059000	Maybe, how about if the XB1 or even the PS4 are cheap enough to even, like, it doesn't matter the factor of all the crappy things they're announcing for it.
5059000	5064000	Maybe if the price is low, will people get it?
5064000	5070000	Well, you know, these rumors keep going around, which, you know, Microsoft rumors tend to be true.
5070000	5074000	And which is funny because it came up on one of our list lists, you know, last year.
5074000	5083000	The Xbox could go the subsidy route where maybe an Xbox One will only cost you $199.99.
5083000	5093000	But with a two-year contract obligation to Xbox Gold or Xbox Network for Halo TV or whatever they decide to add in with it.
5094000	5108000	Well, yeah, it may work, but I really wonder if people will just go ahead and buy it, even or despite all the things, just because it's cheap.
5108000	5113000	So, that's most of what I think right now.
5113000	5121000	Though, in general, I wouldn't get an Xbox One, at least not at launch, maybe.
5121000	5129000	Mostly because it doesn't have a component or an RCA port, so I don't have an HDTV.
5129000	5131000	Interesting.
5131000	5138000	And most people, I know, maybe do have an HDTV that handles HDMI.
5139000	5143000	But I don't know that many people.
5143000	5148000	I have a pretty early, I shouldn't say very early, I have a pretty early HDTV where mine only had component cables.
5148000	5153000	It did not have, it wasn't capable of doing 1080p either. It could do 1080i but not 1080p.
5153000	5158000	Oh, yeah. See, my other TV I have only has DVI and it can only do 1080i.
5158000	5163000	Yeah. So, yeah, you couldn't, I couldn't do, that's the TV that's in our bedroom. I couldn't do an HDMI.
5163000	5171000	That reminds me, so, I know that it's going to support, you know, those resolutions and stuff, but is it going to get all fucked up when you try to hook up your system?
5171000	5178000	Is it going to try to do 1080p and it's like, oh, sorry, can't do 1080p on this TV, so fuck you.
5178000	5184000	Yeah, I don't know. Well, a lot of people have only 720 TVs though because of like 299 sales at Walmart and whatever.
5184000	5187000	I just, I don't know how it's going to work.
5187000	5192000	Maybe it will have native, native resolution. Don't know.
5192000	5197000	What if there was a converter, you know, something you could do to convert the signal? Would that change your mind?
5197000	5199000	You can. You can.
5199000	5205000	Oh, well, there it is. HDMI to DVI or even I think component.
5205000	5207000	I have one of those.
5207000	5221000	But even then, it's like not having the greatest quality, so I wouldn't get that even though I could easily get a replacement for it.
5221000	5233000	I would rather have an HDTV. And right now, I know HDTVs are cheap in the United States, but get on my side of the border.
5233000	5237000	Those things are hell expensive.
5237000	5242000	And that was a response to a comment from Rama in the chat who said HDTVs are cheap. Don't give me that shit.
5242000	5248000	But yeah, you live in Mexico and, you know, there might be fees to import things and whatever.
5248000	5254000	Just, you know, sometimes, you know, it doesn't cost the same that it would here, so it makes sense.
5254000	5259000	You could, don't you sometimes travel to the States, though, to make big purchases? You could. You could, right?
5259000	5275000	I could, yeah, but it's still something that is easy to do because the customs, if you have certain merchandise over a certain price, you have to, well, register.
5275000	5285000	Declare it and all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, okay, but so basically, your big holdup on Xbox One is that it's just going to be too big of a pain in the ass to actually play the thing.
5285000	5291000	And I'm getting the sense there's really nothing yet. I mean, granted, we haven't had E3, but there's nothing yet that's really selling you on the system.
5291000	5298000	But could it, I mean, if they come out at E3 and say killer instinct, are we going to be having a different conversation or is there a game that would make you go,
5298000	5307000	alright, I'll get in the car and drive to get my HDTV. I mean, is there any game that would make you start putting that in motion?
5307000	5320000	They already have it. It's Force of Five. I want Force of Five, but the console isn't, it isn't worth buying the console for just that game.
5321000	5336000	Maybe, yeah, if they announce more games at E3, they will, but if they announce games that interest me, like, yeah, Killer Instinct is going to be like, wow, I have to get the console.
5337000	5352000	But many other games, too, that will at least warrant, well, not warrant, because, to justify the buying the console and getting all the trouble or passing all the trouble.
5352000	5356000	I gotta say, though, as much as Force of Five looks cool, I want a Force of Horizon 2.
5356000	5357000	Oh, yeah.
5357000	5365000	I don't even, don't hate me, but I don't even really like the Force of Games, but because Force of Horizon was more of like an arcade style, like, I loved it.
5365000	5377000	You know what I want? I want, and just because we don't have it yet, how many consoles are launching right now, and no fucking Ridge Racer. Seriously. There is no Ridge Racer.
5377000	5378000	Good question.
5378000	5379000	What the hell.
5379000	5381000	Wait for E3. Wait for E3.
5381000	5385000	I want Ridge Racer. I don't care. I liked Ridge Racer 6. Ridge Racer 6 is awesome.
5385000	5394000	I think Sony should make a nod to their little blunder from a few years ago, and I think they should get Kazurai up on stage to go.
5394000	5398000	And, ladies and gentlemen, one more game, you guys. It's Ridge Racer!
5398000	5399000	Even better.
5399000	5408000	I want him to come out, I want him to come out on a Power Wheels, like, Corvette or something like that, and he's all, Ridge Racer!
5408000	5411000	With the little bike helmet crashing off the stage, yes.
5411000	5412000	Yeah.
5412000	5413000	Alright.
5413000	5414000	That would be cool.
5414000	5418000	Alright, Act Def, I gotta let you go. I'm gonna try to squeeze in one more call, but thanks for the call and the insight.
5418000	5420000	Oh, yeah, thanks. Thanks for having me.
5420000	5421000	Alright, no problem. Take care, buddy.
5421000	5426000	We'll try to squeeze in one more call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
5426000	5430000	Keep in mind, you can also always email your thoughts, mailbag at orangeslaunchradio.com.
5430000	5439000	I did see a couple emails in there already. I'll save those for Jamie in the next Sunday's show, just because we want to wrap, it's 10 o'clock on the West Coast, and I know it's like 1 a.m. for you guys on the East Coast.
5439000	5444000	So we want to wrap up here pretty soon, so we'll do mailbag more on next week's show.
5444000	5450000	But I do want to see if we can get one more call in, so 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
5450000	5456000	Before we get to whatever call comes in, any other news that came out this week we want to get to?
5456000	5462000	There's a new game from Techland that they announced that's a zombie free-running game.
5462000	5470000	It looks like Mirror's Edge Crosswood Dead Island. Looks neat. It's 2014.
5470000	5481000	Also, I know that there was some Amazon overseas stuff that listed Mirror's Edge 2. I don't know if that's wishful thinking, or maybe they're going to announce a new Mirror's Edge game.
5481000	5483000	Sounds good to me either way.
5483000	5488000	That would be nice. I wonder if that's one of the 15 games. It might be.
5488000	5491000	Alright, we do have one more call coming in, so let's go to the phones and take it.
5491000	5493000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
5493000	5495000	Hey, this is Zappi.
5495000	5496000	Hey, Zappi. How you doing?
5496000	5497000	I'm pretty good.
5497000	5498000	Long time, no talk. How you been?
5498000	5500000	Pretty good. Can't complain.
5500000	5503000	Good. Alright. So, Xbox One?
5503000	5505000	Yeah, I've been checking out this Xbox One.
5505000	5506000	Yeah?
5506000	5510000	They're going to crash and burn. This feels like Windows 8 Take 2.
5510000	5512000	Why do you say that?
5512000	5525000	Well, first of all, they're blowing it off Windows. They were talking about the conference about using the Windows kernel, and they're putting that little snapping thing aside because what you want to be doing while you're playing a game is using the internet or whatever.
5526000	5528000	Sure, maybe for epic cues, but...
5528000	5537000	You know, I will say that is one thing we didn't see at the press conference that I did expect to see more of is that we didn't really see any type of like, you know, this is how it works with your PC.
5537000	5545000	We did see the tablet thing, but they didn't say it was specific to Windows Phone or Windows tablet. You know, they implied it would work with iPads, but they don't want to say that.
5545000	5552000	We didn't see as much of that as I thought we would. Not a single mention of Windows 8 that I recall.
5552000	5553000	No.
5553000	5559000	Yeah, like they only said Windows kernel, which could mean anything. They could even have Metro apps. Who knows?
5559000	5565000	But what seemed like most interesting was the Skype looked exactly like it looked in Windows 8.
5567000	5572000	Yeah, well, you know, I understand though that they want to keep like a similar look and feel and what have you.
5572000	5579000	I thought that's why they have their kernel so they can run the Windows 8 apps. I mean, why else would you have three kernels on that goddamn thing?
5579000	5584000	Yeah, no, they also have eight cores to be playing around with, so they gotta be doing something with it.
5584000	5590000	You know, that makes me think that it would be so easy to make games for Xbox One because, you know, you can make the games in Windows or whatever.
5590000	5595000	And then I go, oh yeah, one thing we didn't touch on earlier in the show, they're not going to let indies self-publish.
5595000	5598000	It's the one platform where indies are not going to be able to self-publish.
5598000	5601000	I don't think they've said anything yet about that.
5601000	5604000	But then they say they're going to have something worked out for indies at some point.
5604000	5608000	Yeah, okay, so they're backpedaling on somebody's way too soon comment. All right, fair enough.
5608000	5616000	The one thing that scared me of the Skype thing is I get to the nice ending of Halo 5 and, oh, I got a Skype call completely ruining the ending for me.
5616000	5620000	Well, you would set your Skype to Do Not Disturb, right?
5620000	5624000	Hopefully, but half the time I probably wouldn't remember.
5624000	5625000	Yeah, yeah.
5625000	5629000	Also, that made me think that maybe the true next generation is the Steam Box.
5629000	5634000	Is that where you think you might go with gaming right now?
5635000	5643000	Yeah, a nice little box that plugs into my TV, fully backwards compatible with all the games I bought before. It's starting to seem really appealing.
5643000	5652000	But is there anything Microsoft could do to win you over? I've talked with a lot of the previous callers about that one game that's going to get you to just go back on everything you said.
5652000	5655000	Is there something out there that might do that for you?
5655000	5658000	I don't think so. I've been thinking about it.
5658000	5667000	Sony has a lot more exclusives than I'd want to be playing that might maybe backfill, but Microsoft, Gears of War isn't exactly this killer game I need to play.
5667000	5672000	It's fun, but it's not the game I need, so I don't think there's anything Microsoft can do.
5674000	5684000	Well, and there's going to be some people that are like that. There's just like, you know what, there's really nothing, and I certainly know people like that, there's really nothing Microsoft has to offer that's going to convince me to get the console.
5684000	5688000	What about other, are you currently a Wii U owner at all?
5688000	5694000	Like I saw it at Costco for $200 for the core unit, and I still couldn't bring myself to buy it.
5694000	5695000	Wow.
5695000	5703000	Because there just is no games, and there's none coming on Horizon 1. Wind Waker, I played that for the billionth time.
5703000	5710000	Well, to be fair, wait for E3, you never know. I don't think you should buy a console in anticipation of games six months from now.
5710000	5714000	But, you know, there might be something to make you go, okay, I got to start saving up for the holiday.
5714000	5719000	I don't know, Nintendo needs to be having their E3 conference so that doesn't give a lot of faith.
5719000	5720000	What about PlayStation 4?
5720000	5731000	I'm mildly optimistic. It's so far what they've shown me, but it's good, but I haven't seen much of it because they just showed off a couple of early games.
5731000	5737000	Probably not in 2013 because Killzone isn't selling me on a console.
5738000	5742000	Alright, well, anything else you want to share with the listeners before I let you go or wrap up the show?
5742000	5743000	No, that's it.
5743000	5745000	Alright, well, good to hear from you. You take care.
5745000	5746000	Alright, you too.
5746000	5747000	Alright, later.
5747000	5748000	Later.
5748000	5752000	Alright, that's going to do it for our calls tonight. Thank you guys for calling in.
5752000	5757000	Sorry if you wanted to call in and you didn't get through, but remember you can always email your thoughts.
5757000	5760000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
5760000	5763000	Any other things we want to touch on tonight, Loki?
5763000	5765000	Onomatoguchi's new album is awesome.
5765000	5767000	That's what I hear. I can't wait to check it out.
5767000	5772000	If you go kickstart it, you might find that in their updates, they have the album for you.
5772000	5774000	There you go. Awesome.
5774000	5782000	Alright, well, all the segments you know from the show will be back next week when we do the show again, which would be Sunday...
5782000	5787000	I've got to look at the day here. I think it's the show before E3? No, it would be Sunday, June 2nd.
5787000	5789000	First second.
5789000	5792000	That will be our next show. Sunday, June 2nd will be our next show.
5792000	5798000	That's not quite the pre-E3 show. That's going to be Sunday, June 9th, but certainly the news is going to start ramping up.
5798000	5801000	We'll have a lot to talk about. All your favorite segments from the show will be back.
5801000	5806000	I can't wait for more next Xbox name rumors.
5806000	5808000	Really?
5808000	5811000	No, I'm just kidding. There's not going to be any because they were announcing it.
5811000	5813000	There could be peripherals though.
5813000	5815000	There should be some...
5815000	5818000	It's going to be the Xbox 2.
5819000	5824000	Alright, well, before we close up shop tonight, do you have any final thoughts, Loki?
5824000	5833000	Yeah, so VOG game night is going to be tomorrow night now, which will be Friday if you're listening to this on the podcast.
5833000	5835000	So, you're too late.
5835000	5837000	Not necessarily. I'm going to put the podcast up tonight.
5837000	5843000	So, Friday. Friday around 8 to 8.30 because we usually let Josh see a little later on Friday.
5843000	5845000	Team Fortress 2.
5845000	5847000	So, free. So, go check it out.
5847000	5852000	And... I don't know. I've never played it. So, we'll be interested.
5852000	5854000	I'm going to try to make it this time.
5854000	5859000	See, I don't know. I'm going to have to have someone hold my hand here as far as setting up games and stuff because I have no fucking clue.
5859000	5861000	Like I said, I've never, ever played the game.
5861000	5863000	Talk to ActAft. He's pretty seasoned in the game.
5863000	5865000	Maybe he can host or something. I don't know.
5865000	5867000	So, we'll do that.
5867000	5873000	I was still thinking maybe I might move it to Friday nights going forward because I think it's easier for people to stay up later.
5873000	5875000	Especially on the East Coast because it's weekend.
5875000	5877000	Sure.
5877000	5881000	And maybe not this week, but I have all the stuff to start recording.
5881000	5883000	So, we'll be streaming that hopefully soon.
5883000	5886000	Actually, if you guys are doing Team Fortress 2, I should be able to stream that tomorrow.
5886000	5888000	On the Orange Lounge Radio channel.
5888000	5890000	Yeah, it's PC. I can stream on PC. So, that'll be fun.
5890000	5891000	Yeah.
5891000	5893000	Alright, cool. Alright, well, I guess that's going to do it.
5893000	5895000	Thank you guys very much for supporting Independent Podcasting.
5895000	5897000	I know this wasn't one of our regular shows.
5897000	5900000	You know, Dark Sakura wasn't here for one and we didn't do our regular segments.
5900000	5903000	But if you enjoyed our little banter and you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show.
5903000	5908000	Because there's plenty more across 500 plus other episodes of the show and more to come.
5908000	5914000	You know, your word of mouth and helping to spread the word of the show is what keeps us afloat.
5914000	5921000	Because, you know, we don't have the resources to raise thousands and thousands of dollars to promote and buy ads and so forth.
5921000	5923000	So, thank you guys very much for supporting the show.
5923000	5926000	Leave us a nice word on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or whatever.
5927000	5931000	And thanks for listening to us talk about Xbox One for a little while.
5931000	5935000	We want to hear your voices too. Don't forget the mailbag, Twitter, Facebook and all that good stuff.
5935000	5939000	So, we'll see you back here on June 2nd, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern for another live show.
5939000	5941000	Have a great night everybody. See ya.
5956000	5966000	The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network.
5966000	5969000	But you know they were all still true.
5969000	5971000	See you next week.
