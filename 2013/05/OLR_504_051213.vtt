Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, May 12, 2013, Sony makes moves to grab more indies, XSeed and Atlas combined, and we talk to John G, the creator of the Zelda documentary, It's Dangerous to Go Alone.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May the 12th of 2013, episode number 504 of our show.

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and all things gaming and so forth, culture, blah blah blah, lolz.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
With my co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Blar. Blar. Blar.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
What happened? Did you eat at Panda Express again?

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
No, I have my own delicious food, but this week's been shitty.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Well, that's why you're gonna lose yourself in a super fun chipper episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

01:15.000 --> 01:25.000
I would try, but if I may make an announcement to one of our people in chat tonight for Name & Lights, we offer you our condolences. It's a very difficult thing you're going through.

01:25.000 --> 01:34.000
Absolutely, so you know, it's the extended family here at VoG and we're thinking of you guys when you guys have really horrific weeks too.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
But not having a bad week, I hope, is Techmaster Loki joining us as well.

01:39.000 --> 01:51.000
I was having a great week, up until lunch, because McDonald's, man, I swear, their quality assurance, I swear, their quality assurance is so bad you'd think that they were Bethesda or something.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Don't say funny stuff while I'm eating.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
Just kidding, no, Bethesda's awesome, they check their games way more than McDonald's checks what's actually in the bag.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
That's your job, you're supposed to check what's in the bag.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm supposed to see the quality assurance, yeah, that's how it works.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Don't you see the little sign as you pull it out of the drive-thru, check your order, bitch.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Here's what was missing. First off, they didn't give me sweet and sour sauce, because we had a ton of nuggets.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
Then they forgot to give me the nuggets for the Happy Meal for Josh. The main portion of his meal is missing, and my drink.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
It might be like a whole other bag somewhere, but anyway, you've got real problems.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
You've got real problems, Loki, real problems.

02:32.000 --> 02:42.000
Anyhow, also joining us, say hello to the chatters. We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
And you can join us in chat at live.vog.net.com if you happen to be listening to us live.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
Speaking of Bobby Black Wolf, we always do a little phone call with him at the end of every show, and I forgot during the phone call tonight,

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
because I got distracted by Loki's late arrival, but I forgot to wish Bobby Black Wolf a happy birthday.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Happy anniversary of your hatching.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
That's right. His 29th birthday is today for the seventh or eighth time.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
He actually has me convinced he's 29 now. He keeps lying about it every year, but we hope you have a great birthday.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
I wrote him a Commodore 64 BASIC program for his birthday on Facebook.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Is it the bouncing ball?

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
I haven't done that in a long time. No, it just, it prints happy birthday 29 times and then says, sorry, this program will only count to 29.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Oh.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
There you go.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
I need to do more programming. I haven't done a lot of that in a long, long, long time.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
So, but I'm too busy doing a radio show. What can I say?

03:40.000 --> 03:51.000
So anyway, happy birthday to Bobby Black Wolf. Also, happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there, whether that be, you know, having kids, having pets.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Kitty moms, kitty moms.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
Mother figures, Mr. Moms, you know, whatever, grandmoms, moms-to-be, all those things.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
Happy Mother's Day to all of you and hope you forgot, or hope you forgot, hope you didn't forget to call your mother.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
So, or whoever is important to you on this day.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
I texted mine today and tried to call her and I sent grandmama a text.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
I haven't been super hubble about it, but my grandmoms in the hospital, which is why I'm going to Alabama.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Right.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
So I sent my grandmama a text and then I got a call from my granny after I left her message.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
So I have spoken with maternal people in my life.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Good.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
And as has my husband. Spoken with his maternal figure and her maternal figure.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
Now, I called my mom, but we're doing Mother's Day stuff tomorrow because my mom is very much like, well, not just because of this show.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I mean, I mean, she would understand that.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
But I didn't take her out to brunch or anything because she hates the crowds at restaurants more than I do.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
She's like, I don't want to go out today. It's too crowded.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
So we're going tomorrow.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
And you know where my mom likes to go? You know what her favorite restaurant is?

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
This is so bad. You know what my mom's favorite restaurant is where she likes to go?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
What?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Chevy's.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
You know what?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Didn't I tell you about that last week?

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Don't knock on Chevy's because they have actually a really super good salad.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
All right.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Coming up later on the show in just a little while, we're going to be talking to Joe.

05:09.000 --> 05:17.000
He is the creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone, which is a documentary all about The Legend of Zelda and Zelda fandom.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
And you can check out more about that on Kickstarter or we've linked it on Twitter and so forth.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
And we'll link it when we post the show on on Vogue and OrangeOnTwitter.com and all that, of course.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
We'll be talking to him just a little later, about 15 minutes.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
So to make time for the interview, I don't have a kickoff off topic tonight.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
So we're going to get right into how was your gaming week?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
So, Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
How was your gaming week?

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Well, I've been trying to keep myself super distracted just because of all the stuff going on in my family.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I've been playing Tomb Raider.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
I started Saints for the third and then promptly turned it off because I forgot that I had left it running while I went to bed

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
because I kind of passed out from four glasses of Umeshu.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
I've been doing a lot of drinking this week. I don't know if you noticed. My poor liver.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
I started playing Ragnarok Online 2 now that they finally got the shit working and it's so cute.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
And there's like pourings and flips and they're cute and you can smack the shit out of them.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
You start off the game smacking the shit out of pourings. That's the best way to start a game.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
And those little bastards thankfully don't steal your shit anymore.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
That's good fan service too.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah. Oh, no, all the same animals, all the same creatures and everything are there.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
You remember me taking you on the vocal hunt in the old days on the old Ragnarok?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
The stupid grasshopper with the guitar?

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
You actually get to fight Vocal. You get to find all the same little rare spawns all over the place except now they're kind of like mini bosses.

06:43.000 --> 06:54.000
And some of the job classes have been turned into like the blacksmith profession is actually now a job instead of a fighter class.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
So that's kind of what they did in 14 a little bit.

06:57.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah. But I've been having a good time with it and I think I'm definitely going to quit well just because I have not been having a good time in Oh My God Pandas.

07:05.000 --> 07:16.000
And that and think about how much space I'll get off my hard drive and maybe Diablo as well now that I can keep Diablo for free because I've done my servitude to the Activision gods.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You've held up your end of the blood pact.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Yes. Now my blood is mine.

07:21.000 --> 07:31.000
I have also been playing a game called Off which I am now to the first like world after whatever area zero is.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
And it's weird and I like it except I wish I could play it windowed but I kind of understand why you can't because of how the game is programmed.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
So it's very weird and I suggest that everybody in the universe play it because it's fucking weird.

07:44.000 --> 07:53.000
And I'm going to go ahead and count this in my gaming week is I've been kept I've been rereading like all of Homestuck.

07:53.000 --> 08:06.000
And so I've been actually playing through all the little mini flash games and everything to the point that I'm thinking about reteaching myself flash to do a few little mini games for bog.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah just fun stuff.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Why not?

08:09.000 --> 08:18.000
Practice. I am also, did I say Tomb Raider? Yeah I was playing Tomb Raider or Lara Croft's Really Shitty Day or what did Alan call it? Girl.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah girl.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Girl.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
The game. Girl.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
And I'm also playing Mass Effect 3 again because I'm live streaming it so that I can completely make fun of the game live on air.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
And I have adjusted my time slot so that I do not overlap Loki's streaming.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Or anything else on VOG of course.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
Yeah screw all them. No I'm kidding. No I have been. Oh did you change your picture to Clue?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Yes. Don't talk about what I'm doing on the computer over here.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Sorry I like Clue.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Terrible radio.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I like Clue.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Yeah no I do too.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
We need to do like an online tabletop RP Clue.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
RP Clue?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah if it was like a VOG thing that would be hilarious.

08:59.000 --> 09:08.000
Well I've been working hard on the shadow casting here in Sacramento so if you happen to be local July 27th I'm playing Colonel Mustard in Clue. It'll be fun. It's gonna be fun.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Please there are ladies present.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Alright Loki tell us about your gaming week.

09:13.000 --> 09:26.000
This week I played, what did I play this week? Well I know I played Forza because we did the VOG gaming night and stuff and we've been averaging one extra person each week.

09:26.000 --> 09:35.000
So next week yeah that'll be awesome. Next week is gonna be Grand Theft Auto 4 on the free room because that was Bobby's suggestion.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I wasn't gonna do it because you know I mean I love Grand Theft Auto.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I actually have Grand Theft Auto 4 and I would have no idea what I'm doing so that might be a lot of fun.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
On 360?

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
Do I or do I have it on PS3? Isn't that sad? I don't even know. I think I have it on 360.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
You should have it on 360. It's awesome.

09:51.000 --> 09:59.000
But and in hindsight I was actually gonna loan you a copy if you didn't have it but I forgot to bring one so oh well.

09:59.000 --> 10:08.000
So yeah we're gonna be doing that and then yeah so you'll be joining in that'll be fun. We'll just be messing around driving around.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
You wanna know what's hilarious about that? It's still in the shrink wrap.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
That sounds like games at my house Rob.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
That is a crime.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
You know what's funny? Alan has been like really into Grand Theft Auto 4 lately but he's been playing it all on PC.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
I know.

10:22.000 --> 10:31.000
And just the other day I turned around to ask him a question and I just saw some stripper like fully ass nude on his computer you know titties and hoo-ha and all that.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
And I was like what are you playing? How dare you?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Vagirator.

10:39.000 --> 10:49.000
So yes that'll be fun. I finished also Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 the campaign and that so that was okay.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
And what else?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I know I played some PC games this week.

10:58.000 --> 11:06.000
Well I played one PC game but you know I could say what it is but I can't tell you anything about it other than what it was.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Stay tuned to vognetwork.com.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah it's a game that's coming out next week so you'll have to see what my opinion was.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
That's right.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Tomorrow.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
So yeah I guess that was it.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
That's it?

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
My game of the week. A lot of the same old stuff.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
World of Warcraft obviously because unlike Dark Sakura I still play an awful lot.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Although I've kind of learned how to have fun by myself in a while because a lot of my friends are quitting left and right.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
But we still have the Horde House Guild which is nice because I still see some people on there occasionally so I can at least be a little social.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
And I even ran random dungeons with some people last night that I didn't even know I just knew through the show guild.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
But I had fun.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
But I've been playing a lot more PvP which is kind of how I've been entertaining myself.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
And I know a lot of people are like oh my god I'm so scared of PvP because people are mean and so on.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
But I've just been having fun with it and when people are mean right click ignore and I never have to see their ass again.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
It's awesome.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
But I've also been playing some console games.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
One of the new games I've been playing lately, we got an email the other week.

12:04.000 --> 12:12.000
I think it was last week or the week before that said Rob do you ever actually play the games that you get for free on PlayStation Plus and why aren't you talking about them on the show?

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
Well I did that this week. I actually got one of the free games on PlayStation Plus called Labyrinth Legends.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
And I think this game came out last year but it's free on PlayStation Plus now.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
It's a download game on PlayStation Network.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Best way I could describe it is it's a roguelike game if you know what that is.

12:28.000 --> 12:37.000
It's like a dungeon crawler and roguelike is because it's like this old old old game back on terminal computers called Rogue which was a lot of fun when I was younger.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
But it's like that. You're kind of crawling around a dungeon and it's a lot of puzzle solving.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
You know there will be doors and keys and levers that open things and so forth and monsters you have to kill.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
But maybe they keep spawning unless you do this one thing.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
For example you have to move blocks around in a certain pattern to open a door but the room is filled with gas.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
So in order to be in there to move the blocks in enough time you have to go kill this guy to get a gas mask.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
And then you only get like 30 seconds to do it otherwise you have to go back and get another gas mask.

13:10.000 --> 13:18.000
So it's kind of one of those things where a lot of it is muscle memory and it will take you forever to get through the labyrinth the first time.

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
But then once you kind of figure it out it's like you can speed run it and then you might get your little bonus for getting the time trial unlock.

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
And like each dungeon has five stars and they're very well hidden so sometimes there's like hidden walls and breakaway walls.

13:33.000 --> 13:41.000
So you know a fun little time waster. It's not a very long game from what I understand.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Especially if what I see on the main screen is the only dungeons there is.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I don't know if they had planned to expand this through DLC or what have you.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
But for the price of free being a PlayStation Plus subscriber I really can't complain.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It was a fun little waste of time.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
So that was one of the other games I've been playing this week.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Other than that I can't really think of a lot.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Virtual console stuff on Wii U has been my other little obsession.

14:04.000 --> 14:12.000
Playing Mega Man, Mario World, Kirby, looking forward because I hear Super Mario 2 is out next week so I'll give you an excuse to play that again.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
And you know what else is out next week? Big deal. Big deal guys.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Super Metroid. Yes.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Don't you already have Super Metroid?

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
I have Super Metroid on an actual cartridge for that Super Nintendo sitting right over there.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
But I will play it again on the Wii U because it's an amazing excuse to play through it again.

14:31.000 --> 14:41.000
And plus it'll be slightly different coming through the speakers on the little gamepad and TV.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
And I'm all about playing Super Metroid in as many different ways as I possibly can.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
So there you go. That was pretty much my gaming week.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
So a little bit of housekeeping before we get into tonight's news and our interview coming up in just a few more minutes.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
I want to say of course if you're not following us on Twitter you really ought to be.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
And we're also on Facebook as well where you can get the Fugu Question of the Week there and Google Plus.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio all one word.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
Or you can follow us on Google. Google Plus. Just search for OrangeLoungeRadio.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
YYR in chat at live.vognetwork.com says isn't Super Metroid going to be 30 cents?

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
Correct. Yes it is only going to be 30 cents and YYR follows that up with then everyone should be buying it.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
Correct. If you actually own a Wii U and you have a way to pay for things online.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I realize not everybody has a credit card.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
But you seriously should go to Target and get the $5 card just so you can buy this game.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
And if you get it quickly you can get Kirby for 30 cents still too. Just saying.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Koopa Kid Jeremy in chat room from Koopa Club. Howdy.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
Says Super Metroid should be purchased in every form. Agree.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
See? Jeremy knows what's up. He understands.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Super Metroid greater than everything else.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
Alright let's get into some news. Let's do at least one of our news items real quick. Loki.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Except for Super Super Metroid.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
That'd be funny.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
Well and I never got into Metroid Prime as much as I did the 2D new Metroids.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
What if they did a Super Metroid 2?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Well I mean-

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Hey I understand the 3-

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Zero Mission and Fusion kinda.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
That's more of a remake sort of.

16:17.000 --> 16:25.000
If they did something in the Super Metroid universe on the 3DS akin to what they're doing with Zelda.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I'd have a nerd boner. I would.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
How could you not?

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
I love the 2D Metroids. The 3D ones aren't bad. I really enjoy the third game in the 3D series.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
For some reason. I know a lot of people hated that one.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
And I even like the DS Prime Hunters thing. That was a cool little concept.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
It's not the same. Like when you get all Doom up in here with my Metroid.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
Like it's not the same. It's not bad. But I'm not as like fanboy as I am over something like Super Metroid.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Anyway. News.

16:56.000 --> 17:03.000
Anyways. So Sony's definitely trying to get more indie games on their services.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
And one way they're planning on doing that is actually waiving the license fee for PlayStation Mobile.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Now PlayStation Mobile's on pretty much everything.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
PlayStation including Vita and PSP.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
As well as PlayStation Mobile approved phones.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
You know. Whatever that might be.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Originally they were paying $99. Now it's free.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
And they're trying to get I guess the barrier of entry even lower than it was.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Which I think $99 isn't that bad.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
It's kind of like what it was with XNA.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
On top of that they are adding an indie game section to the PlayStation Network.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
And you can actually find this. It should be available now.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
And they are featuring all sorts of games.

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
Some of the bigger named indie titles like Retro City Rampage, Papayo, and Dyad.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
That kind of stuff.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
But definitely a step in the opposite direction than Microsoft is taking.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Do you think that this could be in response?

18:09.000 --> 18:15.000
Like this is a place where maybe they see that Microsoft is vulnerable right now having done what they did with XNA.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
Where Sony's like hmm maybe we should just kind of pluck that idea and implement it.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
Well I think that they see a lot of popularity with the indie scene kind of rising up again.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
With Kickstarter projects and just indie games in general.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Steam Greenlight and that kind of stuff.

18:30.000 --> 18:38.000
And so if it's easy for people to bring that content that may be on PC right now to the PlayStation Network.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Then they're all for it.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
That's more eyes on the PlayStation Network and more reason to buy a console that plays those games.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm sure Retro City Rampage, a pretty good example, Hotline Miami.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
I think that's coming or already out for the Vita and PlayStation 3.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Lots of games like that.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
So yeah it's definitely good.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Promote more people to come to your platform.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Definitely better than go away.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
YYR in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
Personally I think the removal of the $99 fee is just because they want to increase the number of titles available.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
Well certainly. Anything to add value to the Vita I think is going to be something Sony's going to want to explore.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
For real.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
YYR also follows that up with,

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
Microsoft is actually paying $100 to anyone who submits a Windows 8 app through the end of June.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Yeah but that's Windows 8. No one wants to submit a Windows 8 app.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Going back a story a minute here because this is something we neglected to mention during Metroid talk.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
But Tigerclaw in chat says,

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Metroid Other M was more of a direct sequel to Super Metroid.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
I forgot about that. I think a lot of people do because it wasn't developed by Nintendo.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
It was that whole Team Ninja third party experiment thing.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
I didn't hate Metroid Other M as much as some people did.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
But obviously I didn't remember it either.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
So I think that kind of tells you where Other M is.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
And Metroid Other M kind of sounds like, you know.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It was a weird title too.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Coca Cola classic. You know it's the UnCola.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I guess that would be 7-Up.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
Titles are so important and I think a lot of times people kind of forget that.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
I mean I get that they want to get a title that really conveys the message of the story of the game or whatever.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
And I get it but there's so many more people that would have just been like,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Oh Super Metroid 2? Other M? Heck yeah!

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
You know I think that carries a lot of weight that sometimes people forget about.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Anyway.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
What else do I want to ask on the indies? Going back to the indies for a minute.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Do you think this is going to be embraced by the indie community?

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Not so much Sony but do you see that people would be like,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Yeah I'm going to develop for the Vita.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
I don't know how easy it is to develop for the Vita.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
But I know a lot of those Kickstarter projects you see.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
You always see Wii U as actually a platform.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
As okay my indie title is going up on Wii U which is kind of interesting.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I mean it couldn't hurt.

21:08.000 --> 21:16.000
I think if they are struggling with financing then definitely removing that fee would help.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Hopefully get more games on there.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Hopefully that doesn't mean that's going to dilute the games that are on there.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Like with a lot of garbage indie games and stuff.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Sorry about the little ding dong by the way.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
My Facebook thing decided to go off.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Which I hate that stupid beep beep on Facebook.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
You can't turn it off.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
You heard what you're going to be able to expect coming soon.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Auto playing video ads.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm just ready to leave Facebook forever.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Can't wait.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Hi dead air.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
I just completely am really.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
I've turned off every type of notification I possibly can for Facebook.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
And now they've actually started being able to bypass my ad block.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Rama and Chet says you can disable it.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Well I need to do my more research.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
But I'll have to do that later because it is time to bring on to the show Joe.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
And Joe is a creator of It's Dangerous to Go Alone.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
It's a movie that is a Zelda documentary.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
And we're going to try to get him on the line right now to talk about this Kickstarter project.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
And the movie which has a trailer which you can watch if you go over to the Kickstarter page.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
And search for It's Dangerous to Go Alone.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Or if you just search for Zelda movie you'll probably find it and you can see the trailer.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And check out what this project is all about.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
But I believe Joe is with us right now.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Joe you there?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
What's up man?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Hey how you doing Joe?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
I am excellent.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
Just enjoyed a beautiful day at the beach in sunny Sarasota Florida.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
I really appreciate you taking the time out to come on our show.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I know it's Mother's Day and all that.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Yeah actually we were planning to be on location in the Everglades believe it or not today.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
But we had to cancel the shoot because it was Mother's Day and postponed.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Well you know we're out in California.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
So I associate everything Florida with Disney World.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
And four of my closest friends are all at Disney World right now.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
But not me.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
That's hilarious.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Not me I know.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Alright we're not here to talk about Disney.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
We are here to talk about Zelda.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Yes sir.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Yeah tell us a little bit about your project Joe.

23:20.000 --> 23:27.000
Well it's a couple years ago I was actually playing with my production partner up in Baltimore when I was living up there.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
We were playing through Zelda 2 because we'd never beat it as kids.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
And we just went on a mission and bought a bunch of alcohol and played through Zelda 2.

23:38.000 --> 23:45.000
And started conceiving of a documentary project that we could do about the ubiquity and cultural influence of The Legend of Zelda.

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
And we had a lot of artistic friends who were either filmmakers or musicians or artists or writers or whatever.

23:51.000 --> 24:00.000
We all grew up together playing those games and it was sort of our first opening of our imaginations was through the world of Hyrule.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
And so it kind of planted a seed of an idea of hey that would make for a cool documentary someday.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
And all of our other projects are wrapped up or whatever.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
And a couple years later I found myself in a perfect time to film that exact movie.

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
And started putting the feelers out and we started doing some research, started doing some legal work.

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
And found just a trove of awesome people that are legitimate artists and filmmakers and out in Hollywood.

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
And illustrators for Google and best selling authors and all these people that wanted to be involved and that were hugely inspired by the franchise.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
And we said yes this is a really cool project that we want to do.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
So that's how it started and it's been very cool getting it up and running.

24:44.000 --> 24:52.000
So hearing you talk about that and watching the trailer would you say that this movie is less about necessarily Zelda and Link and the characters than the story.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
But it's much more about the fans and the culture?

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
Yeah I'm not going to say it's void of talking about Zelda of course.

25:02.000 --> 25:11.000
But it's definitely more about not the fandom necessarily but how it has impacted us in a cultural way.

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
It's such a profound way that it's hard to even estimate.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
For instance as kids we're all playing this child's video game and our parents definitely don't get it.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
We're six, seven years old. We're playing this Nintendo game.

25:26.000 --> 25:32.000
And at that time me and my best friend we'd play through these worlds and all the way up through A Link to the Past.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
We were really passionate about it. We were really into it.

25:34.000 --> 25:41.000
And that best friend that I had growing up with that game, he now works for the military doing cyber security.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
Like protecting our government accounts against the Chinese and all that stuff that you're hearing in the news now.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
That's his job and his first foray into technology was Nintendo games.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
That was his first passion for it.

25:52.000 --> 25:59.000
So it's really interesting to see where all these Zelda fans, that was their first big experience with art or technology or fantasy.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Where they've ended up and all the cool things that they're doing now.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
And they kind of owe a lot of their art or love for fantasy to that franchise.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
So what notes do I play on the ocarina to unlock those big bank accounts? That's what I want to know.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
That is an excellent, excellent question. I'll tell you what, that will definitely help fund.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
If you find out, let me know. The film will do a little bit better.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
Well, you know, I gotta say, my memories of Zelda myself.

26:24.000 --> 26:31.000
Zelda, and specifically that game, was how I got to become more popular in elementary school.

26:31.000 --> 26:38.000
You were that guy too. People would come to you and ask you, where is that thing? And you would know.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Yes, because I wasn't good at sports or any of that, so I got picked on all the time.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
But around the fourth grade or so, when Zelda first came out, it was like, Rob, I know you do nothing but play video games.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
How do I find the fourth dungeon in the second quest? Whatever it is, it's awesome.

26:54.000 --> 27:01.000
The first girl I ever had a crush on, the first phone call I ever got from a girl that I had a crush on was about Zelda 2.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
She had questions about Zelda 2.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
That's awesome.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
So I feel you, man. I'm right there with you.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
And this is exactly the thing. Here you are doing a podcast on gaming.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
And really, if it wasn't for games like that, you might not be doing what you're doing.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Absolutely.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
It's fascinating to look at that and where people have come.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
So why did you turn to Kickstarter? You're asking for $50,000 to fund the project.

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
So what is the $50,000 for and ultimately why should we consider backing it?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Ah, because it's awesome.

27:36.000 --> 27:44.000
Well, first of all, we're competing with, say, the My Little Pony documentary, which got funded for $322,000.

27:44.000 --> 27:53.000
For those people who aren't filmmakers or don't know, for those of you who are filmmakers, you probably know that $50,000 is a very, very small budget.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
That's a micro-budget production.

27:55.000 --> 28:04.000
For those of you who aren't into film or have never really worked on a film, first of all, a lot of that money for this project especially is going to go towards legal.

28:04.000 --> 28:14.000
We've already been working with a legal team because we want to stay on the right side of fair use since this is somebody else's intellectual property that we're sort of focusing on.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
And so far, so good. I mean, this project, everything that we're doing stays on that side of it.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
But still, we need to dot our lowercase j's and make sure that everything's kosher.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
So legal is going to be a big chunk of that. But another big chunk is the travel expenditures.

28:30.000 --> 28:41.000
This isn't just a documentary where we're gathering a bunch of YouTube videos and we've got a podcast mic and we're talking over them and explaining the history of the series through gameplay videos or something.

28:41.000 --> 28:58.000
We're actually really trying to get some unique one-on-one personal stories with people like Howard Phillips, who started Nintendo Power, and the guys from Rainfall that did that awesome April Fool's Day trailer for The Legend of Zelda for IGN a couple years ago.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Which was awesome.

28:59.000 --> 29:06.000
Yeah, yeah. And these are all people that we've talked to that either we've already got interviews with or they're lined up.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
We're going to have way more footage than we're going to be able to fit inside of our 90-100 minute documentary.

29:13.000 --> 29:27.000
But we want to travel to these places and sit down with these people and see what they're doing now with their lives and find out how exactly Zelda has inspired them and how they've maintained with the series as they've grown up and become adults.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
Their children are now playing the games and see their impressions of it.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
So because of that, we're going to be traveling a lot and a lot of the money is for travel.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
A lot of it is also for the distribution.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
Once the film is complete, how do you get it out there?

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
We could just put it up on YouTube, but that's not the kind of film that we're creating.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
You want something on the big screen.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
The physical media, digital distribution channels, things like that.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
So that's where really the money is going to be going.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
And like I said, $5 million is a low-budget film.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
$50,000, that's a micro-budget documentary film.

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
And the reason I think we turned to Kickstarter, we really wanted to do a crowdfunding.

30:07.000 --> 30:16.000
We've actually got a couple of decent offers as far as people who want to back this project in more traditional terms like investment-wise or producer-wise.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
And that will be awesome and if the Kickstarter doesn't work out, we'll pursue those.

30:20.000 --> 30:27.000
But we love the idea of Kickstarter and this being a project where we're not trying to appease investors.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
This is a project for the community.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
This is a project that belongs to the community.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Everyone has a little piece of it.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Okay, awesome.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
Well, speaking of community, we have our live listeners assembled in the live chat room live.vognetwork.com

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
if you're listening live on this Sunday night.

30:43.000 --> 30:49.000
And if you have a question for Joe about this project, It's Dangerous to Go Alone, the movie, send us a question.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
And we'll possibly read it and ask it of Joe.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Well, lately it's just been a debate over what the best Zelda game is.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Is that what's going on in the chat right now?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I side with the Link to the Past people.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Me too, but I know there's a lot of ocarina.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Well, you know what's funny about that?

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
I'm of the same school and just out of curiosity, how old are you guys?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
37.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
34.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
Okay, I'll be 33 in a couple of days.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
So we're all kind of in that age where we grew up with all the Zelda games, you know?

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
And I'm curious about the young people who started with 3D Zelda games.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
If they go back and play Link to the Past, do they have that same experience?

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
But the one thing that makes me think that maybe they do, and we're examining this in the documentary too, by the way, a little bit.

31:29.000 --> 31:37.000
There's as much excitement and anticipation for the sequel to Link to the Past as there is for the Wii U Zelda.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Yes.

31:38.000 --> 31:49.000
I think that's really telling as far as how compelling that game was and how the 3D element is awesome and the visual element is great, but that doesn't make the game necessarily.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
You know, a good story makes a good game.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Exactly.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Especially in that series.

31:55.000 --> 32:09.000
And I think, though, that there has to be elements of gameplay that, you know, are just the right level of frustrating versus rewarding for your frustration to make it feel like it gives it replay value.

32:09.000 --> 32:15.000
That's why, I hate to say it, Zelda 2 for me, I learned how to be a potty mouth with that game.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
I tell you what, we relearned a couple years ago when we played it through again.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
We were cursing like 10-year-olds. It was awesome.

32:22.000 --> 32:29.000
You should hear me and my husband whenever that game gets broken out at my house. It's just like, ah!

32:29.000 --> 32:38.000
But honestly, I think that Link to the Past took the formula from the first game that everyone seems to like so much better and really perfected it.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
And if they can keep that going with the sequel, then I think the sequel is going to be successful.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
And then you might see a bigger console release following suit and, man, that would be awesome.

32:47.000 --> 32:57.000
With the capabilities you'd have for a Wii U title, to be gameplay-wise more like Link to the Past, I would be really curious to see where they could go with that.

32:57.000 --> 33:04.000
I think Bobby Blackwolf, who's always on before us here at VOG Network, he has a good comparison that probably applies here, too.

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
Because he always talks about Final Fantasy and that your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that was out when you were 13.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
So, probably with Zelda, a lot of that's true, too.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
Yeah, your first experience in that universe, definitely.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.000
And it is something that we're examining. Actually, there's a writer, and I'm not going to talk too much about it.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
And right now, you have to just wait for the movie.

33:26.000 --> 33:37.000
But if we include his segment, he talks a little bit about the difference between cinematic storytelling in games and video games themselves and almost creates two different mediums.

33:37.000 --> 33:45.000
And he talks about how console games currently, they're more like cinematic experiences rather than true game experiences.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
And there's a really strong divide between the two.

33:48.000 --> 33:54.000
And the more recent console games for Zelda and stuff and for everything have gone more towards that cinematic experience.

33:54.000 --> 34:01.000
But a game like the sequel to Link to the Past will be back to the center is not the story. The center is the gameplay mechanics.

34:01.000 --> 34:09.000
And the story is almost incidental. They still want it to be very strong, but that's not the focus. The focus is the game itself.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
And it's a really interesting thing to think about.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
Well, let me ask you this question since I did bring up another franchise a minute ago that has a lot of fan passion, too.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Final Fantasy, absolutely.

34:18.000 --> 34:25.000
Well, why did you go with Zelda? Why not Final Fantasy, Mario, Samus? Why not another character that we remember when we were young?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Why did you go for Link and Zelda?

34:27.000 --> 34:34.000
I think we're going to talk, it's not just going to be about Zelda. There's also a lot that talks about just 8-bit gaming and why that survived in general.

34:34.000 --> 34:40.000
And why that, there hasn't been a crash since the 8-bit era. The gaming industry has grown and grown and grown since then.

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
That was the seed that planted it, it became what it is today because of the NES era games.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
And so it's not just necessarily about Zelda, but that's the core of it, Zelda.

34:50.000 --> 34:58.000
And why Zelda over the other franchises? We just found that it was absolutely ubiquitous, just everywhere.

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
And, I mean, Final Fantasy, you could probably find the same thing for somebody who's in love with Final Fantasy.

35:03.000 --> 35:09.000
Myself, I just, again, finally played through all of Final Fantasy VI and beat it a month ago.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
I played it three times. The first time when I was a kid I never beat it.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
The second time I was in college and I was using an emulator and that computer crashed.

35:16.000 --> 35:21.000
Finally I beat it, you know? So I'm a big Final Fantasy lover, too.

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
But there's something about The Legend of Zelda that separates it.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
And I wish, part of the purpose of this documentary is investigating that exact question.

35:31.000 --> 35:38.000
That game, I feel like gaming wouldn't exist in its current form had it not been for the original Legend of Zelda.

35:38.000 --> 35:45.000
It might never have grown into what it is without those early franchise games, and I think that was one of the core ones.

35:45.000 --> 35:52.000
You know, we all, at 5, 6, 7, to 10 years old, we all felt this connection to that reality for some reason.

35:52.000 --> 35:58.000
True. Let me follow that up with a comment in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com from mm2k who says,

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
I think you had to be around at that time to fully appreciate the impact of the original 8-bit franchises.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
I love docs like these because they truly underscore the impact these titles had on the gaming culture.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
Newer gamers should see when gameplay trumped cinematics and cutscenes.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Dark Soccer, you had another question for Joe?

36:14.000 --> 36:20.000
I did, actually. Have you also been exploring, since you're looking at the genre of that type of game as well,

36:20.000 --> 36:29.000
are you also looking at some of the, for lack of a better description, clones on other systems, like Neutopia that came out for the TurboGrafx-16?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Even Legend of the Valkyrie was kind of the same.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.000
Sort of. There's a point, again, there's so much footage that's going to be shot for this documentary,

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
we're going to have to really make some difficult decisions in the editing room.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
But there was a point where we talked a little bit about Crystallis for the NES.

36:45.000 --> 36:52.000
Not a different system, but what Zelda could have evolved into had there been another NES release.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
And we talk a lot about that.

36:55.000 --> 37:01.000
And we don't get too much into cross-platform, mostly because I guess we're all,

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
and you were either a Nintendo kid or you were a Sega kid when growing up.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
And it sounds like you guys were both Nintendo kids, so you understand.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
No, no, this one was a Sega, very much a Sega kid.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
Leave the room now, you're no longer in my new talk. Sorry, you're out of the conversation.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Wait a minute, she was a Sega adult, I guess.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
No, my husband grew up with a Master System and a Genesis.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
I grew up with my NES, and my brother's SNES when they moved, I bought my SNES,

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
and then my husband said, look, Sega Saturn, and I forgot everything else existed.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
And now my favorite system to this day is the TurboGrafx.

37:34.000 --> 37:42.000
Interesting. No, it's funny, and I love it too, because it's so fun to see the people's devotion to there.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
And when I was a kid, it was Nintendo. F everybody else, screw Sega, no.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
I won't hear it, I won't believe you.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
And the fandom, it's not just fandom, it's like your family member,

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
like someone's talking bad about someone in your gang.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
It pained me when I jumped ship to PlayStation. It pained me.

38:01.000 --> 38:07.000
Yeah, yeah, really. And you almost are offended when your favorite releases aren't released on your console.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Yeah.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
Why? Why is Final Fantasy not on a Nintendo console anymore? What happened, you know?

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
And that was exactly it. Exactly it.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
Oh, just look for the N64 demo, and then you'll realize why.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
Let me get to some questions from chat. We have a good one here from SSJ100Matt who has a question for you.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
What's Nintendo's stance on the project? Have they contacted you, or have you contacted them?

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
And the reason why I ask this is because I noticed with documentaries on a specific subject matter,

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
tend to get some type of resistance by the original creators wanting to have their own stamp on the project,

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
or have it told in a certain light.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
Right, well, and that's a really tricky question. We have tried to reach out to Nintendo,

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
but there's literally a million people per day with a project that try and reach out to Nintendo.

38:48.000 --> 38:55.000
So we do have sort of a second-degree contact with Nintendo Legal,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
but we haven't really gotten any word back from them.

38:57.000 --> 39:03.000
Fortunately for this project, our project is not about The Legend of Zelda per se.

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
We're not examining the particular artwork of the games or the stories of the games.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
We're really examining how the public reacted to that artwork and how they responded

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
and how it sort of gave them their own artistic appreciation for gaming

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
or spawned their love for art or creativity or music or whatever.

39:24.000 --> 39:34.000
So in that way, there's not really a lot of legal area that we have to worry about with appeasing Nintendo,

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
because it's not directly related to Nintendo. It's about Nintendo, this game's influence on other people.

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
And we've been working very close with the legal team, making sure that everything sort of falls in fair use.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
And because of that, we have to make some executive decisions, which we wish we didn't.

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
And there's things we want to include that are kind of gray areas that we're sort of having to scrape off.

39:53.000 --> 39:59.000
But all in all, we haven't run into any problems with Nintendo Legal yet. We're hoping that continues.

39:59.000 --> 40:05.000
But even if there is a problem with Nintendo Legal, it would break our hearts because we hope that they support this project.

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
But it's not going to stop the documentary just because of the nature of the documentary.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
Okay. Let me ask you this, because of course when it comes to Nintendo,

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
the fanboys are pretty infamous in their passion for a lot of the Nintendo stuff.

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
And somebody linked me a thread on a Nintendo news website where the project got some cold reception.

40:25.000 --> 40:31.000
What would you say to people that aren't getting this or think that you're trying to profit off Nintendo's IPs?

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Oh man, there's so much stuff I wish I could talk about right now,

40:34.000 --> 40:41.000
but I am unable to talk about it until the Kickstarter campaign is complete, because of Kickstarter's legal.

40:41.000 --> 40:48.000
I don't mind if people are criticizing the take on the documentary.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
They just don't like this or think it's appropriate.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
They don't like me or my voice or my style or the filmmaking,

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
or they thought that the motion graphic title at the end was cheesy or whatever.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
I don't mind that kind of criticism. I've been doing film for a long time.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
I'm used to people liking it and people hating it.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
I don't like the people who think that we're profiteering off this project.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
We're probably not going to see a dime from this project.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
I can't really go into much detail beyond that,

41:17.000 --> 41:23.000
but I will say that the profits beyond production costs will not be going to us.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
That's all I can say about that.

41:25.000 --> 41:32.000
As far as the people who don't like the style, there's people who want to hate things on the Internet.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
They see something, they're worried that we're going to destroy their childhood.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
But for every one of those people, there's probably a thousand people that have contacted me and said,

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
Thank you for validating my entire childhood.

41:44.000 --> 41:49.000
My fiancé can attest to it. The first day I saw some of those negative reviews,

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
I'm like, Why? No, I'm trying to do something. You'll like it.

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
After that, enough people prompted me that, Hey, no, man, you've got to finish this.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
I really want to see this. It made me feel a lot better about it.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I think people will enjoy it.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
Well, there's an old saying we have here at OLR,

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
and it goes back to when we first got our first one-star reviews on iTunes and so forth,

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
when we're paying out of pocket to do this show, and it goes, Haters going to hate.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
That's what they say.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
At least they're not telling you to get back in the kitchen.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
That's right. If you do something that is successful, and if this turns out to be successful,

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
there are going to be people who will just hate it just because it was successful too,

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
or that maybe they didn't think of it first, or that they would have done it a different way.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
We'll accept that. This is going to be our story and the way that we want to tell it,

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
and we hope people like it. If they don't, they don't need to watch it.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
They don't need to buy it. They could bash it all they want,

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
but I feel like there's a good amount of people that do like this idea

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
and want to see what we're coming up with for it.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
All right. Well, let me ask you one more question on a bit more of a positive note,

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
and then maybe if there's one or two more from Chad, I'll try to squeeze those in too.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
What do you hope, on a more positive note, when people watch this movie

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
and the credits roll fade to black, what feeling do you hope people walk away with

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
after viewing your movie?

43:05.000 --> 43:11.000
That's a great question. I got a feeling that the vast majority of watchers

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
are going to be people like our age that grew up with the entire series.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
Those are the people that it's really designed for, and they're going to feel validated.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
They're going to understand a little bit better this undefinable connection

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
they have with that franchise and why that one above all the other ones.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
Like you said, why not Metroid? Why not Kid Icarus? Why not even Super Mario Brothers?

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
Why is there such an emotive connection to The Legend of Zelda?

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
And I hope this helps them feel like they're in good company,

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
especially the people that aren't the super hardcore Zelda nerds out there

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
that are just kind of passive adults now.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
And they're looking back like, yeah, that really did inspire my life and why.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
And I'm hoping they leave with that.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
Awesome. Well, speaking of inspiration, Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
I wonder if The Legend of Zelda has inspired people who work in the entertainment industry,

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
not in movies or television besides in gaming. Well, you work in movies.

44:04.000 --> 44:13.000
Well, no, we've got one Hollywood writer that is very much backing the project financially

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
and has agreed to be in it.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
So he has requested that I not talk about that too much

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
because he's got another Kickstarter campaign going right now,

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
so he doesn't want to split.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
But no, we actually have some people in Hollywood that we'll be talking to in the documentary.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
Like I said, the people that work at Rainfall that did that cool IGN trailer.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Oh.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
So they're going to be in it.

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
And also some gaming companies that are more prevalent in today's market.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
We actually have an artist that's a new artist at Blizzard

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
who's going to be chiming in about the direction of art and games and things like that.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
So yeah, absolutely, we're going to be talking to some people that are currently in the entertainment industry.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
One more question here from YYR in our chatroom,

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
and this one might be a little bit tricky, but it's fair based on Nintendo's actions in the past.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
If you go forward with this and Nintendo gives you a cease and desist right before you release,

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
but all the money has been spent, what happens then?

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Is that of concern?

45:08.000 --> 45:14.000
Yeah, I can't say it's a 0% threat, but we've done everything to minimize that.

45:14.000 --> 45:21.000
And like I said, the U.S. has some great fair use laws for documentary and filmmakers.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
We're pretty well versed in those and having done documentaries in the past.

45:25.000 --> 45:33.000
And we've worked with a legal team for about six months before we even considered that this was a realistic project that we wanted to attempt doing.

45:33.000 --> 45:38.000
So we're really, really, really working hard to stay on the side of fair use.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
And like I said, in some cases that means we had to scrap some of the ideas.

45:42.000 --> 45:49.000
But even if they tried to slap a cease and desist on us, which like I said, I hope that they had in full support of the project.

45:49.000 --> 45:57.000
But even if they tried, they really wouldn't have a lot of legal backing in the way that we're telling the story.

45:57.000 --> 46:07.000
So we're working really hard on that. I can never say it's a 0% possibility, but we're being very, very, very careful about that.

46:07.000 --> 46:14.000
The best that probably would be able to happen was they'd have to say that this scene and or that scene would have to be cut from the film.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
And aside from that, the film would be definitely still produced.

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
Gotcha. Well, you know, when I think of a movie like King of Kong, which obviously everybody knows with documentary and gaming and Donkey Kong was a Nintendo game.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
And that movie happened.

46:26.000 --> 46:33.000
And that was filmed without Nintendo's consent, at least originally. I don't know if they ended up gaining it in retrospect.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
Everybody trying to beat that score.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
Not to mention all of the other footage of the Midway games.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
Yeah, there were other things in that too.

46:44.000 --> 46:55.000
And I encourage anybody who's interested in doing projects like this to check out the fair use laws and see how they protect documentary filmmakers and things like that.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
One of the scenes that's difficult is the scenes from the Symphony of the Goddesses.

47:01.000 --> 47:08.000
But we got full permission from the creators of Symphony of the Goddesses. We had great sit-down interviews with those guys.

47:08.000 --> 47:15.000
We were able to film the orchestra. They told us that they have permission to extend permission up to two minutes of filming for us.

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
So you could film and use two minutes of their footage in the course of the documentary.

47:20.000 --> 47:27.000
So, you know, there's things like that. Like, yeah, there's imagery shown on the big jumbotron behind the orchestra playing Zelda themes.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
But they were able to grant us permission to use it. There was just that stipulation.

47:31.000 --> 47:42.000
So again, you know, the capturing of the imagery at that point was incidental. It was commentary on the music going from 8-bit chiptunes to full-on orchestration.

47:42.000 --> 47:49.000
And because it's commentary like that, if you really look into the fair use laws, you'll kind of see how that works a little bit better.

47:49.000 --> 47:58.000
And anybody who's interested in doing a project like this, I encourage doing that and really studying it and getting with somebody who knows entertainment law before you try and take it on.

47:58.000 --> 48:05.000
Well, Joe, you're very passionate about this project. I can hear it. I can tell that you're a long-time fan of gaming and so forth.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
And I really wish you the best of luck with this project and getting funded.

48:08.000 --> 48:14.000
Anything else you want to say? You want to tell the listeners one more time how to check out the project and what it's all about and consider funding?

48:14.000 --> 48:19.000
Sure. A couple more things I'd love to talk to you about if you can give me just a couple more minutes.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
You got it.

48:20.000 --> 48:30.000
If you guys go to www.TheZeldaMovie.com, if you're on a computer as opposed to a mobile device, there's a nice little 8-bit game that is the navigation for our site.

48:30.000 --> 48:37.000
It's kind of fun just to play through. A lot of people have. And you get to a windscreen and you get to see two extra minutes of the film.

48:37.000 --> 48:43.000
But yeah, if you check that out, that will also lead you. There's a link there to our Kickstarter, link there to our trailer.

48:43.000 --> 48:52.000
So www.TheZeldaMovie.com. And the only other thing I wanted to talk about that we haven't been able to show yet but we're finally able to sort of talk about.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
The main way that we want to distribute this film, we're going to have more traditional channels.

48:57.000 --> 49:05.000
We've got a company that's working on digital distribution through online sources such as iTunes and we want to distribute Blu-ray and DVD and stuff.

49:05.000 --> 49:20.000
But the main way that I really want to distribute this is there's actually going to be a playable game which will be sort of metaphorical of the adventure through which you can sort of play through a non-linear version of the film and find different interviews and all kinds of bonus material.

49:20.000 --> 49:28.000
And we're going to try and make that available definitely for iOS devices, probably for Android and something that's a standalone Mac and PC game as well.

49:28.000 --> 49:41.000
And that's not going to be like the 8-bit game on the site. That's going to be a very unique digital experience inspired by the gameplay and mechanics of original Legend of Zelda games but resemble and look more of a contemporary modern video game.

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
So we hope that that's the way most people watch it. That's how it's intended to be watched.

49:46.000 --> 49:52.000
Well that sounds like a cool little extra and I think I saw some rewards in the Kickstarter have to do with being a part of that game.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
That game or the 8-bit game that's going to be on the site for the duration of the film, yep.

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
Nice, very nice. Well best of luck to you Joe in the project and thanks for sitting down with us today.

50:02.000 --> 50:09.000
You know I hear that our pal Bobby Blackwolf here at the Voice Geeks Network who did a story on this before might be in the movie.

50:09.000 --> 50:20.000
He was actually out of one of our first filming experiences in Atlanta and we're going back up there in June and he's been a very strong proponent of the film which I appreciate.

50:20.000 --> 50:30.000
That's awesome you know and it's great to know that as a fellow gamer and a fellow Zelda freak that he supports the project fully and absolutely so that's awesome.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
Alright well we support you too so best of luck to you Joe. Thanks for...

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Now where are you guys at in California?

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
We are in Sacramento, California.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
I love Sacramento man. When I get out there I'll make sure to look you guys up.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
That is amazing that you've actually heard of Sacramento because most people are like...

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
I used to tour with a rock band. Sacramento was one of my favorite towns when we traveled.

50:48.000 --> 50:54.000
We have a great support of the indie music community out here. This is where Warp 11 is from.

50:54.000 --> 51:02.000
Hey my friend's husband went to school with the lead singer and I used to work with their old drummer's girlfriend.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
Nice.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
So yeah.

51:04.000 --> 51:09.000
It's also a small town. Alright Joe you take care and thanks again for sitting down with us tonight and best of luck on your Kickstarter alright?

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Thanks guys.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
Alright you're welcome have a good one.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Take care.

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
www.TheZeldaMovie.com for more information on It's Dangerous to Go Alone.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Loki did you enjoy hearing what that guy had to say?

51:20.000 --> 51:29.000
Yeah. The only thing I was kind of combing through the rewards. A little disappointed to see that there's not a wooden sword as a reward.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Like an actual sword.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Like an actual wooden sword.

51:31.000 --> 51:36.000
I mean it would be that hard. You just take a couple two by fours and slap it together on me.

51:37.000 --> 51:44.000
Alright well maybe in the future you'll hear this back and think about adding something like that.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
A little hard to ship you know.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
That's true that's true and some people frown on sending weapons in the mail.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
Anyhow let's move on with other video gaming news tonight.

51:52.000 --> 52:02.000
From Zelda and the great 8-bit games of yesteryear to a very modern Diablo 3 and the modern problems that come with a game like that.

52:02.000 --> 52:08.000
You know Blizzard put out a new patch 1.08 for Diablo 3 and there was a huge bug in the game.

52:08.000 --> 52:16.000
It increased the stack size for in-game gold in the auction house from 1 million to 10 million making gold 10 times cheaper.

52:16.000 --> 52:22.000
And if you cancelled a gold auction you got refunded double the amount.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Oops.

52:25.000 --> 52:32.000
So people were exploiting this left and right to generate trillions of gold.

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
Isn't this the whole reason why Diablo 3 clung to this always online thing.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
It's not about the DRM it's about the integrity in the auction house duh duh duh.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
And then they fucked it up with this bug.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
So why bother with always online.

52:47.000 --> 52:54.000
Well I guess that's maybe why the Playstation 4 and 3 ones are going to go a different route and not have to worry about that shit right.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Hmm I don't know.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
Well if there is any possible silver lining to this.

53:01.000 --> 53:10.000
Blizzard in talking about the bug said that just 415 players all of which were sanctioned actually used the exploit.

53:10.000 --> 53:22.000
And the real money auction sales that were generated as a part of this all of the proceeds will be redirected to the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.

53:22.000 --> 53:30.000
If you had a legitimate transaction you have nothing to worry about but if you were one of these 415 sellers that sold the excess gold guess who really got your money.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Charity.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
You know I always hate that they always punish people that exploit bugs in games.

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
Like if you're hacking that's one thing if you're exploiting like a bug or glitch that's kind of dumb.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Yeah but you should have seen some of these people man.

53:44.000 --> 53:51.000
I saw somebody on or at least I saw a link to a clip from Justin TV where this guy was like I'm going to walk you through how to do this duh duh duh.

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
And then he's like what are you going to do about it Blizzard come at me bro duh duh duh.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
And then of course they came at him.

53:57.000 --> 54:06.000
And but you know it's kind of like when I see that kind of cockiness and arrogance you're kind of like you're waiting for these guys to get the ban hammer and it's kind of hilarious.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
Come on look you got to admit like a guy like that kind of.

54:10.000 --> 54:15.000
I'm not necessarily talking about this situation I'm talking about like you know like Call of Duty for example.

54:15.000 --> 54:24.000
They have it's stupid they consider like jumping up on certain like areas that you might not necessarily think about jumping up on a glitch.

54:24.000 --> 54:32.000
And so they patch that out and you can actually get like banned or you know short term banned for using these glitches in game.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
Like what the hell. It's a container that you can jump on.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Why should that be a banable offense.

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
Well it's just weird to me that somehow this really horrific bug was missed.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I mean this is huge.

54:44.000 --> 54:51.000
I don't know it's just kind of goes to show that tying your game to online may not fix all your problems.

54:51.000 --> 55:00.000
It's weird that you know you might have a bug like that and then sometimes you may have a bug that causes your workers not to drive their cars to work.

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
And said walk up a giant hill and lose their jobs because they're you know they're too far away from.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Oh I have to be the Sims.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
All right moving on.

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
That's why you just cheat and give yourself the motherlode code and buy a teleporter.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
I mean I don't do anything like that at all do I.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
But the whole point of at least the older Sims game.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
I'm not talking about New Sim City but all those cheat cheat cheat cheat.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Everybody cheats in those games.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
That's the fun of the game.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
That's why this New Sim City was very like to me because it's always online.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
How am I going to cheat.

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
You know which I know they have their sandbox mode but it's not the same.

55:34.000 --> 55:43.000
The fun of the Sims for me was pretty much building my house and then seeing getting all of the you know really dirty add ons that people would make.

55:43.000 --> 55:48.000
Prince Brightstar in chat an interesting comment it's a difference between single and multiplayer games.

55:48.000 --> 55:54.000
You know Diablo's auction house is very multiplayer but see that's where Diablo is in a weird place because a lot of people are like.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I want to play Diablo as a single player game.

55:56.000 --> 56:02.000
This is why I hated the online thing in the first place is that it wasn't never a multiplayer thing to me.

56:02.000 --> 56:09.000
For me I think Diablo is more fun with more people but you know I respect those that don't want to play the game that way.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Playing with other people is hell.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Awesome.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
Because it reminds me of like.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
What was it.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
The.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
Oh crap.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Now I can't remember the hell that.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
The gauntlet.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Got legends.

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
Reminds me that it'd be cool to do like a Diablo arcade game like with four players at the same time and just.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Oh yeah.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Oh yeah.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
The gauntlet legends was kind of that.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
I know.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Anymore.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
It was amazing.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Getting in 64.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Dust it off.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
All right.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Anyhow let's move on.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I can dig one up for you.

56:44.000 --> 56:55.000
Anyway there's a rumor going around and there was even a fake logo out on Reddit about this that the next Xbox was supposed to be called the Xbox Infinity.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
Yeah.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I'm sorry.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
Good.

56:59.000 --> 57:05.000
Well this is supposed to be a report from the International Business Times.

57:06.000 --> 57:17.000
And that there was also says to be floating around in rumor land about an Xbox TV video streaming set that was mentioned via Wall Street Journal.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
But Microsoft is like we're not commenting on that because it's rumors and speculation.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
And even if it's true we aren't telling you.

57:24.000 --> 57:34.000
OK well the International Business Times thing is completely fake by the way because their source they said unnamed sources and they said read it right there is like OK.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
That's not true.

57:35.000 --> 57:40.000
And yes it came out that the person actually created the Photoshop for that said nope that's not true.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
So yes unfortunately the exit will fortunately be Xbox infinity thing.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
Not true.

57:47.000 --> 57:57.000
More likely is the fact fusion which would be you know something that would tie in with all the site registrations that they have for Xbox fusion or something like that.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
So some part of it still a dumb name whatever.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
So yeah Xbox infinity.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
That's just a ridiculous name because how do you go from there.

58:05.000 --> 58:13.000
I mean if you have plus one at any rate basically just talking about this for the sake of squashing the rumor mill.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
It's not true.

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
Like getting your information from Reddit would be like me writing my term paper on Wikipedia.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
It could be correct but you don't know.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
You don't know who these people are.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
I solve crimes on Reddit.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
No there's nothing wrong with getting some news from Reddit.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
As long as you back as long as you can trace stuff leaks out.

58:32.000 --> 58:41.000
It's fine if stuff leaks out but you have to have some sort of evidence that leaks a screen a picture on Reddit is not evidence.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
That is like that's ridiculous.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
To be fair I don't want to make it sound like we're dogging on Reddit.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
I love Reddit.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
I'm a user.

58:49.000 --> 58:57.000
I you know I post on things and so forth and it's been a great place to enrich the Warcraft podcast community has a great subreddit.

58:57.000 --> 59:02.000
But you have to because Reddit is a part of the Internet.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
You have to be a little bit of a skeptic.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
You have to be.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I'm not saying it's just an extension of everything else in the end.

59:07.000 --> 59:12.000
Reddit's bad but it's just like saying you saw a screenshot on some random Web site.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
If you have nothing that if you have no like sort of evidence to back that up.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
You know let's say you have actual sources.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
Now we know that the International Business Times has no fucking sources.

59:22.000 --> 59:27.000
Their sources are fucking some dude that's in their IT department or some intern.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
Hey I was on Reddit during a quote lunch unquote.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
Or examiner.com is almost all like user based.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
And Forbes is going that way too.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
But here's the worst fucking part about that.

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
So they ran that story and they checked no sources or whatever.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Nothing.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
And so they ran it.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
Then everybody else ran it.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Everybody ran it.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
It's like what the fuck.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
First off these guys don't check their sources.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Then you just don't check your sources either.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
You're just as bad as they are.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Oh there's a there's a lot of those journalists sites that they keep their tabs on.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Another response.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
So you may have seen us run this article about this.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Well it was a clever photo shot.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I was like come on man.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Seriously you didn't even check anything.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I thought you had sources that had information about things.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
OK back when the whole beautiful Katamari thing happened to us right.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
That was all dig which you know was kind of like the Reddit of five years ago right was dig.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And you know when when our story got up voted and all that on dig because people were you know seeing it on our site.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
That's when it really blew up and it was everywhere.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And then you know he got got too far exposed.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
But anyway.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:57.000
But I'm saying that there's it's just they're not thinking if all these sites have sources though it just makes you wonder how legit these sources are if they're taking Reddit photos.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I mean I'm not saying it's bad it's on Reddit but just like an anonymous screenshot on your website or something like that.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
To be fair some of them credited it with due credit.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Like I saw a run of this story on Ars Technica that said you know here's this story about Xbox infinity and then they ran it with the logo but the caption logo was here's how one Reddit user named imagine the logo to look you know and it was it was done right.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
So.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:33.000
All right. Anyhow I like the name Xbox infinity but that's about as far as I give this story anyway.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Sorry we'll see me May 21st it is almost here for God's sake.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Right now one more one more show full of this crap.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
You know what I don't even care.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I'm calling it the shit box.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
We already let our listeners vote it's Xbox lube.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Or that or I'm gonna like build a new litter box for my cat that looks like whatever the new Xbox is so she can poop in it.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:14.000
All right. What you need to do I mean it's already it's begging for a Photoshop but you know Invader Zim had these alien race with the amazing fusion technology and it's basically duct taping shit together so you know I fused this phone with a hamster.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
They already did that with two game cubes.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Not duct tape. I've known people who have held computers together via duct tape and I saw a car that seemed to be held together by nothing but duct tape and chicken wire last time I was in Alabama.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I kid you not the whole door.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Prince bright star chat says name speculation has always been a part of new console launches remember the Nintendo on. I do and I remember when they were just going to call it Nintendo or revolution remember that.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Well technically it was called revolution it was their code name for that but you know just like dolphin and drango seven dolphin dolphin.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Just a commercial.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And then Tyra bank screaming and running.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:14.000
You know we're talking about the midness new litter box being an Xbox lube. The thing is is that if we got one of those Dan would put it on the shelf and Midna would try to take over and sit on it because that's what she does with our current Xbox.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:23.000
That's what video game systems are there cat warmers have a black shelf and a black Xbox and my black cat sits right next to the Xbox when she's trying to blend in and hide from people.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It is the funniest thing because you where's cat where's cat where's cat green eyes there's a cat knows the Xbox is just on fusing with the Xbox.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Nice. All right. Let's move on.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:52.000
All right. So there's yet another rumor about a set tops box version of the next Xbox and you know it kind of goes back to the rumors where they were saying that you know there's going to be two different types of Xbox systems there's going to be one that's kind of like a Apple TV or you know something that's basically connected to the Internet always.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:03.000
But it has no actual media media drives or anything like that. It's mainly meant for like streaming and you know Xbox Live arcade and that kind of sort of thing serves that.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And this is actually coming from I guess an anonymous source that told the Wall Street Journal that this Xbox TV thing is in the works and I guess we'll have to wait until the 21st to see if that's actually going to happen.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I think we've been hearing a lot of rumors about it. It would make sense if they did something like that because I mean the new focus of the system aside from playing games is going to be kind of integrating with the you know your TV watching you know they want to have their own content.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It's a big thing you know for people that don't necessarily game on the Xbox you know or if you are gaming on the Xbox the other half of your time is probably watching Netflix or Hulu or something like that.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000
So it would make sense that they're trying to integrate it even more.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Every Xbox though that's come out they've had this advertisement for linking your TV shows and doing you know making it a hub for all of your entertainment it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being accurate.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I don't mind the way they've got it right now but I don't like having to launch separate programs for everything. I just kind of want it as like channels almost if that makes sense.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:31.000
You know just like OK I need to watch you know or kind of like how they do it I guess on the Wii U with the TV is you know OK I want to watch The Simpsons or something and then it's like OK The Simpsons are on Netflix on Hulu and on Fox right now.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Or on you know Amazon and you can pick where you want to stream that shit from instead of having to figure out OK well I got to go on Hulu.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Oh shit it's not here. Oh I got to go on Netflix. Oh it's not here. Oh I got to go here. You know it'll show you where it's at and where you can find it or if it's on TV right there or you can maybe go one step further and say OK I want DVR that.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Did they integrate Netflix into TV finally.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I think that was the first thing that they integrated.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
No it wasn't there at first it was they had Amazon was in there at first.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I think was the first I know it's I think it's on there because it's that and then Amazon.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I actually used my Wii U for Netflix last night but I didn't do it through TV I just was in the Wii U.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:23.000
So I'm going to our chat room at live dot vog network dot com Rama says Xbox TV just like Apple TV but cheaper and less uppity.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Hey well it might not be cheaper either.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Apple TV is pretty fun and cheap. Ninety nine bucks now.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
You know what though you can just have a computer.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Yeah build a ninety nine dollar computer.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Or just get somebody's old PC that they're not using or get one at a thrift store as long as it'll go online it works.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
It's just not sexy though.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Mine's pretty sexy.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Bobby Blackwell in our chat room confirming yes they did with the integration with Netflix on TV.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
They've also recently integrated Hulu Plus and I'm pretty sure on that last one at least.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yeah I just had to look it up because we're having a seminar this week about video streaming and what it means for our business.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Basically a bunch of people going to be saying oh it's so difficult don't worry don't worry you can still sell movies.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
All right well moving on to back to games.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.000
A big merger happened in the gaming world this week exceed the games who made what Pandora's Tower.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
They made other a few other games to like a lot of cult like didn't they do the last story and they did the last story.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
They brought all those rainfall games over.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Yeah everything except for the first one.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Oh the Xenoblade yeah.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Well Exceed purchased Atlas Online and Atlas of course did what like Disgaea.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Don't they publish that and you know they they do a lot of those publishings.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I think Atlas Online is a separate entity from.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Oh derp derp.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Well good I'm glad you clarified that but Atlas Online.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Promise of wild arms.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Atlas Online has been purchased from or has been purchased by Exceed games and they've now formed a new name.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
So you're not going to hear this anymore you're going to hear Marvelous USA.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000
They will be based in Irvine and it's going to be all the employees from the former Exceed game teams.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And with Atlas Online I see because it's going to be about enhancing mobile and online game markets.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000
So it's kind of more about rounding themselves out so that probably you could see like a Pandora's Tower like iPhone game and so forth.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
This has nothing to do with this guy.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
They've got.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Was it killer is dead is their next big kind of multi platform release.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
All right well very cool.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:46.000
You know it's not like you know these are these are two kind of smaller ish companies joining together to try and step it up and compete more with the big guys like EA and so forth.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
So this kind of neat.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Yeah it doesn't sound like there was job loss that came out of it.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
So great.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
All right let's move on.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Well in other news we have well some very interesting news coming out of for EA.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:12.000
They have a FIFA exclusive license until 2022 which I guess they're not hurting all that much if they're getting the FIFA games.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:20.000
That's including the FIFA World Cup game and everything under EA Sports for the FIFA branding.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Also now and this is the kicker I would say is that Disney is giving EA a Star Wars game agreement exclusive licensing for all of the Star Wars characters and storylines.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:43.000
EA is going to develop and publish the new titles for a quote core gaming audience over.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
See all interactive platforms and the most popular game genres.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Disney is retaining the rights to develop new titles with mobile social tablet and online gaming.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:00.000
So Disney thank you for killing the Star Wars franchise by putting it in EA's hands.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000
You know and they're going to rush everything out and give us shitty endings and change the writing halfway through the story.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I don't think it's a bad thing actually because look at some of the look at the game to everyone wants Star Wars battlefront to publish the last three or three whatever it wants equal to two.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:26.000
So look who published the last one I mean I think it was EA under you know they published it for LucasArts if I remember correctly.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
So that's not so bad.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Well was it just me or when you guys read the news about this this week did you just suddenly hear this in your head.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
You know what.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
You might laugh.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
EA owns your ass right now.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Coming to wreck all your favorite games.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Hey I look forward to Star Wars FIFA soccer.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
You know what I was going to use this as my wedding march.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Had we not gone to the courthouse.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
You were literally you were going to literally walk down the aisle to this.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I was.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
You know what I was going to walk down the aisle to.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Tara walked down to Doctor Who stuff because she walked down to the Star Trek The Next Generation opening.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Now I know it sounds weird to hear me talking about walking down the aisle but you have to realize in a gay wedding it'll be a little bit different.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:33.000
But I already have my song picked out.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
You guys miss Alan in the background.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Alan just like with impeccable common timing just walked by and went nope.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
That was Abba's I do I do I do just in case you didn't.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I imagine most of our audience probably didn't catch the reference but that was it.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Oh come on. It's you. They know you and your love of Abba.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I just wish that we had a webcam on when you were playing just dance Abba.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And I'm glad we didn't. That was the funniest thing I've ever seen.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I really had to walk down the aisle to the song week.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I don't remember. I remember your ass.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
You should remember the D.J. that was absolutely terrible.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
When you walked out.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
OK. Not the aisle but when you were introduced.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Yeah yeah yeah. No no no.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.000
When we first walked out when we walked in the aisle it was supposed to be I think it was supposed to be a sunrise sunset.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I think was supposed to be what they're going to be. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
And then it ended up being like week or something.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I'm like the hell are you playing.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Nice that you're at say that your wedding was pretty fun.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000
And I will say that Chris that Chris Brown song that you have that everybody dancing to that's band.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
You will not hear that. You will not hear that goddamn song at my wedding.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
So all right. Anyway.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Rama in chat says Rob Roberts is going to walk down the aisle to its reigning men or something by the Spice Girls.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
How gay do you think I am. No Spice Girls.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
That's totally you. I mean then again I am talking about walking down to Abba but that's different.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
That's classic. Abba is classic. That's right.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
But Spice Girls is getting pretty classic. I'll tell you what you if you want to class it up a bit.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Get lucky. You just need to get lucky.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
It's not even really walking out. It's more strutting.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I'll just I'll just I'll walk down to the music from Tron.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
No no no no no. The game has changed.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
You have to you have to do you have to do that.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
You have to do the Wendy Carlos Tron soundtrack. Oh no no no.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
And we'll have blue lights everywhere. All right.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Anyway somehow we went from Star Wars to weddings.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
But all right. So Loki doesn't think this is such a big deal.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
You know what. The Star Wars games lately have been so bad.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
What was really what was the last time there was a good Star Wars game.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Super Star Wars. Granted the Old Republic. I didn't hate it.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
I just think it was a better single player game.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And some of the MMO aspects didn't work out so well and kind of flopsied.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
But like I can't stop thinking about that Star Wars connect game.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
It was so bad. Okay well that was really terrible.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:17.000
What about before that the force unleashed. I think some people like the first one.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
That was supposed to be all right. Oh Alan's here.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Are you going to are you going to comment further on the music choices Alan.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
No just Star Wars games.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Force Unleashed I thought was pretty good even if the first one wasn't quite finished.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And Jedi Academy. Jedi Academy 2. I love that game. I'd love to see a third one.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I remember Dan playing through Rogue Squadron and that seemed pretty neat.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
No more no more Star Wars characters in Soul Calibur though you can bet that.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
That's that's done. All right.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
You know what. That was a mistake.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I liked it. Star Killer was an awesome character.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Not so much the Yoda invader that was what the Star Killer made a great character in Soul Calibur.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
But anyway.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Maybe we'll get another Marvel fighting game from EA.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
All right let's travel around the world. Look those Star Wars games what they're not.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
They said none of them in fiscal 2014. So it's going to be a while before you see these games.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
So for now let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming a little bit sooner.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
This week there's only one game coming out and that would be Metro Last Light.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And that's on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on bognetwork.com

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
use the passphrase damage.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Well that was short.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Yep. We've had a lot of weeks of just like nothing lately.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
It'll pick up a little. Everyone's sleeping.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Especially with summer coming up you would think.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I wish I was sleeping right now.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I'm usually dead though.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Well they're usually like a bunch like late May early June like right when the kids get a bunch late in June.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
But it's not the case this year.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Interesting traveling over to Japan and checking out what is coming out over there.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I know we've talked about this series before a love alternative total eclipse on PlayStation 3.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I know we've talked about this before. Isn't it like an anime or something.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
We finally figured out is what it's about. I thought it was like a girl groping game or something.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000
It sounds like it sure looks like it when you see pictures like that where they don't show the guy's face.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
You know it's porn. There's some love going on.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000
And then Mac warriors. I remember this. It's like based on an anime or something.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I think somebody had to educate us on this. That's all the animes.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
You know what like scantily clad women and Macs.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
That's all the games in Japan that don't come out over here.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
And honestly I have no problem with that.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I mean because that's pretty awesome.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Macs are awesome. Women are awesome.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Bob Coffee in chat says it's a visual novel.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Visual novel is not so awesome.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Stop.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000
On the Xbox 360 also Muv Luv is there as well.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
By the way that's a regular limited edition and Famitsu deluxe pack.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I'm assuming Famitsu is going to give it a 40 right.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
No probably not.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Moving on to the PlayStation Vita.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Nothing this week but there will be a new blaze blue pretty soon.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Or is that a price reduction.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Oh sorry that's a price reduction.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Why can't we get any more Tokimeki.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
You know good old fashioned dating sims.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
You should write your congress person.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
They have visual novels coming out from axis games.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000
It's more of the I don't remember which series it is now.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
But they've done a couple on PSP and they keep putting them out on PSP.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Rama from our friends at Anime Jam Session.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Tuesdays on VoG says Loki you shut your whore mouth.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Not all anime is boobs and ass.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
All the good ones though.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Hey.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Hey there's lots of good anime out there that isn't boobs and ass.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Like Pokemon. Pokemon.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
I didn't say it was all boobs and ass. I said it was boobs and ass and mechs.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I was about to say Macross but yeah there's some of that there too.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Alright on the Wii U this week nothing.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
But Biohazard Revelations Unveiled Edition is soon.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
That would of course be Resident Evil over here.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
On the 3DS this week G1 Grand Prix gets a price reduction.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And that's really it on the 3DS this week.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Lastly taking a look at one more console here.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
The PSP because there's still some things trickling through over there.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Summon Knight 5 comes out this week from Namco Bandai.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Or as they call it over there Bandai Damco.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
So there you go.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
That looks neat.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
It looks like another little chibi.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
It looks like a strategy RPG thing.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Like a tactics style game.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Never mind.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Well how about the UK?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Yes how about it?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
They have crumpets. No I'm kidding.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Well yeah they do but still.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
On the 14th of May we have Dust 514.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
On the 15th we have Sanctum 2 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.000
On the 16th Frozen sign ups for iPad and the Starship Domre on 3DS.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And on the 17th Metro Last Delight for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
And that is all.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Alright just a couple more news stories for you guys.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
And then the classic game of the week.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
But first Loki.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Alright.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
So Silicon Knights.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
You may remember them for 2Human and a bunch of other games.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I remember them for 2Human.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Well they have closed their doors or closed their offices.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000
They have emptied out their offices and unloaded some of their properties.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
In fact unloading some assets from Eternal Darkness I want to believe.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
To the Shadows of the Eternal Kickstarter there.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So they've actually got assets now for their new game.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And they are still arguing with Epic Games over 2Humans still if you can believe that.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
I mean how long ago? 2008?

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I mean jeez.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Give it up already. You haven't won yet.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Oh 5 whole years ago. No. Yeah. 5 whole years ago.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
They're still fighting them even though I remember the last thing.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I want to say the last settlement. The judgment was that they owed even more or something now.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I don't remember.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Yeah. 4.45 million going to Epic Games.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And still they're fighting it.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Gosh. I don't know.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I don't think we're going to see any more games from Silicon Knights.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Yeah. I think it's safe to say you probably are not going to see anything else from them.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But you will see some new games possibly on a new game console.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
It's a mobile game TV console. It's called Game Pop.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
This is being made by Bluestacks.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And you can play mobile games on your TV with this little device using the controller.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
An iPhone or an Android smartphone.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
But here's where it's different than say the Ouya.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Which is probably the first thing that pops into your mind which is very similar.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Something like Game Stick.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
The subscription model is like Netflix here.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000
For $7 a month you get the entire Game Pop library.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
That's 500 games right now.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Now how many of those are actually good games? Who knows?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
But out of 500 there's got to be at least a few.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So it's more the... What's the streaming?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Game Tap.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Yeah. Game Tap. Or what was the other one that is the streaming stuff just a few years ago?

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
On Life.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Yeah. The On Life model.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
So anyway. Yeah. Very interesting.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Also if you pre-order the console this month you get it for free.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
As long as you are doing a paid subscription to the service.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
There is no commitment or contract.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000
The only little catch is that you have to return the console if you cancel your service within one year.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000
But as long as you're willing to do what? 12 payments of $7.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
You would get a year's worth of games in the console.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
But again they're mobile games on your TV.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
And it's something that you need to have a mobile phone to...

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Or basically you have to download an app on your device to play.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
No since there's a controller. Or you can use iPhone or Android.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Really?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Yeah since there's your controller.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000
That's what I was a little confused on because they actually in their trailer they don't actually show a controller.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
They just show you have to download the app and use your phone as the controller.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.000
In fact actually I don't think there is a controller because it basically what it does is it changes your phone into a controller.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
It's almost like a second screen if you will.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
But that's the only thing that seems kind of unappealing to me.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Because if you really want to do that.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
And I know that you can say the same argument about the Ouya and stuff.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000
But you can get like an HDMI cable for your phone for like less than 30 bucks.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
And plug your phone into your TV.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
But there's the whole fact that you get 500 games.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Now act deft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
It says Action 52 had 52 games in it and how many of those were good?

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Well but one of them was in Angry Birds.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.000
There might be a couple gems amongst I'm sure a lot of throw away games here.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
But you know there might be some good stuff.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
It's an interesting idea.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Do you think we're not that far away from Xbox or Playstation?

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Well hell Playstation Plus is kind of like this.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:19.000
It's been saying already that the Xbox 360 or the new Xbox is going to be focusing a lot on free to play stuff.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Probably because it makes sense.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Because if it's free to play you can avoid piracy because who cares.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Pirate it, more copies are out there and you make all your money in DLC.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I don't know.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
It's alright if they don't make it ridiculous.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
You know what I mean?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Alright well let's take a trip back in time to a time when you know you didn't have any of this subscription fees to play a game or anything like that.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Unless you had to tell of you.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I guess but I think this game might go before that.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I don't know.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
No this game is well after that.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Oh okay.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Well we're going to take a trip back in time then just a little bit to a classic video game the Dark Sakura has picked for us.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:07.000
She's jumped into the vault and said hey ungrateful kids play this game this week and respect gaming.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week?

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I picked the Neon Genesis Evangelion game for Nintendo 64.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:20.000
It actually out of all of those games that's come out like the Saturn games and the other ones.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
This one has to probably be my favorite.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:30.000
It was really fun as far as it going through the entire series with the various battles and everything.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:39.000
It was based pretty directly on the TV series and actually went into events for End of Evangelion.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:48.000
So you had 13 missions that were basically focused on each of the angels going up to the...

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
In fact this scene that I've linked here is the mission 12 where you go against the Eva series.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
And then at 13 are the other...

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Yeah I went up through 13 levels.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.000
So basically this is just a retelling of the series but it's one that you participate in.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000
You play as the various pilots in the game.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:19.000
There's even like this one right here is probably my favorite part in the entire series where Asuka gets her big I'm going to kick everybody's ass moment.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Oh wait I'm no longer in a coma.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
It was really really freaking well done for something on the Nintendo 64 I just had to say.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:33.000
So really there's not that much to say about it.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
It's that you basically control the weapons as they go.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:47.000
You have cinematic attacks, you have actions, you have a different type of game plan that goes through.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
You're sort of in a 3D, 2D course where you can walk back and forth.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:57.000
But it pretty much has to do with just pressing the right commands to do the cinematic attacks.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I mean that's really the basis of it.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And then in the end you have like a free for all.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000
You're still in that 3D, 2D sort of movement you can move more freely.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
And that's used in missions 12 through 13.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:18.000
You also have parts that are outside the missions like a training mode that's called simulation.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000
You have different models that you can view.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
You've got your story mode so you're actually playing through the events and the stories.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And really there's actually also a versus mode too where you can do two player Eva versus Eva mode.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000
And it's really just simple.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
It's freaking Evangelion you're playing the episodes.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
And this one to me was the best of them.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Just because it had more of that action element to it and less of the whole, as I was calling the Saturn ones, dates of Evangelion.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
It's just good, good game.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.000
It was the best of the lot and I think that for anyone who's a fan of the series you should definitely give it a try.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
For a Nintendo 64 game it looks really good too.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
It does.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:17.000
If I remember correctly this is one of the games that was released during the later part of the Nintendo 64's life.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Because I remember I think that I first played this when I had a Dreamcast.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I know that one of my friends bought this and that's how I played it.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
But this is on my list of things to eventually pick up.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
It was a really, really fun game.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:43.000
I mean really since it's Nintendo 64 I'm throwing it on the list because I really can't say enough good things about it.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:49.000
It may seem kind of dated now but for its day it was pretty nice graphics and really good gameplay.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
It was very solid.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
That's it.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Alright there it is your Classic Eve of the Week for the Nintendo 64 Neon Genesis Evangelion.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Awesome.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Neat pick because I don't know much about that series at all but watching that YouTube I was like oh this looks kind of fun.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Alright we're going to take a quick break but when we come back there is plenty more news to come.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
The Frugal Question of the Week all about Zelda in the spirit of our interview earlier tonight.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Your emails and plenty more.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Your calls too when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio Episode 504 right after this.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Hey everyone I'm DJ Ronda S.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I'm Ari Rockefeller.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
And I'm Mako-Chan with Anime Jam Session.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
The show where every gamer has a voice.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And I want to use my voice to tell you that I like video games because I can kill people and not have to worry about going to prison.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Wow I always use my voice to tell you that Final Fantasy 7 is the greatest Final Fantasy game of all time and is not overrated.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Oh boy.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I want to use my voice to tell you that I would pay all my money for a Capcom fighting game crossover where no one bitches about to line up making dream candy.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Never happened.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I know but I do like that.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Good idea.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Can we go get food now?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Fuck yes I'm hungry.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Yeah I kind of want the pink berry.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Mmm pink berry.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Alright just got here.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Peace.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
See ya.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Alright.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Episode number 504 in progress.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I want pink berry now.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Loki wants to use his voice to tell you that animes with boobies are better.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I want pink berry now.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Everything with boobies is better.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Um you know I can actually imagine a few things that putting boobs on would make it absolutely not better.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Could you imagine boobs with boobs?

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
That would be frightening.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Double boobs?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
No no no no just boobs that have boobs.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Wouldn't that just be like a cow or something?

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I don't know.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
No.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
That would be torpedo breasts.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
No.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Alright look you guys are awkward.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Alright um I forgot to mention this during my gaming week but I should mention this device that's sitting on our studio table now.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I got an IK this week which thanks to Dark Soccer I was saying something about it on Facebook that it was on sale.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Did you get Blazing Star? Did you did you did you did you?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
No but I.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Why not?

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Well because I have I may or may not have a MAME emulator on the iPad and so I was playing Mega Man the Power Battle this week.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
It's kinda awesome just saying.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
You know what?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
What?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Ugh.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:38.000
I will check that out as well too but uh yeah I was having and I don't want to hear it about the whole like you shouldn't support MAME and piracy and all that.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I I bought every single stinking Capcom arcade bundle pack and every freaking.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
You supported Game Room.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Yeah I did look.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Yeah exactly.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I bought I eat up all that retro shit when they put it out so.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Totally totally totally.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
The the Metal Slug games are actually super fun.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Oh yeah I bet.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
With the IKd but Blazing Star.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
I told you how to get it to work right?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:05.000
You start the game then you leave the game and go back into it and then the IKd will work with it.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Oh.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
It won't right when you start up.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Well you know what else I have on there?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I have a Rygar which is awesome obviously the arcade version and I was I actually had it working once I think I think I took it out but I had Beatmania on there at one point.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Like the old school one yeah Beatmania you can do on there.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
But the thing is I can't figure out how to map the buttons.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Yet so I'm kind of stuck with the default configuration so if I wanted to play Beatmania on that it would kind of suck.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
You should use the make your joystick or scratch.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Yeah.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Just flick it with your hand.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.000
It shouldn't be that hard if it means but you know I think it's just one two three four five.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Yeah I think so.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
So.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Alright well anyway we're going to get back into some news here rapid fire news.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
So Loki.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Alright so let's talk a little bit about the Sims.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Well actually SimCity.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:05.000
SimCity is getting a 3.0 update this week and is attempting to fix the traffic problem again.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Because if you remember 2.0 kind of made some more problems.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.000
So they're trying to fix that and so we'll have to see later this week.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
She makes for some interesting reads.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Also they announced The Sims 4.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:31.000
It's going to be coming next year on PC and it is going to be offline and single player.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
They made sure to mention that.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And last but not least you may remember you know such wonderful games getting rebooted.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Like well Duke Nukem Forever Maybe is not a good example but Rise of the Triad.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Well now Shadow Warrior getting redone by Flying Wild Hog.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:03.000
They're the developer and it's supposed to be published by Devolver Digital.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Which you know has done all sorts of awesome things so.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I kind of you know I almost forgot a little bit of Shadow Warrior.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I love Shadow Warrior because you know it had a slightly better version of the build engine.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
So you could do like upstairs and downstairs.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Because remember the build engine you couldn't really like create rooms.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Like if you had an elevator or something like that.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
You had to create like a teleporter that would teleport you to different room.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000
It was the limitations of the engine so.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Looks cool I can't wait.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Going back to the SimCity stories for a minute here at our chat room.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster says great another traffic fix.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Haven't they had to fix the traffic in like every single patch they're doing something to it?

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Yeah they have and it just hasn't worked.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Well you know traffic is a serious problem.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
It's not you know if you can fix traffic that easy LA would have it figured out by now.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Well remember the last time they tried it the last patch like fucked up sewage or something like that.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I'm sure it'll get taken apart once they put it out.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Also forgot to mention that SimCity has reached 1.6 million in sales.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
50% of that were online so.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
That's not surprising I think.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Considering if you think about considering that you know.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I don't know a lot of people purchase PC games online nowadays.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Speaking of traffic just totally random aside question I heard this on the radio the other day.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Obviously LA is the worst city in the nation for traffic but do you know what the number two city in the nation is?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Atlanta Georgia.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
It is not Atlanta Georgia.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Have you ever been in Atlanta driving?

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I'm telling you it was not ranked number it might have been number three I don't know but it was not number two.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And it was not it was not Sacramento and it's not San Francisco on game day.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Nope it's not San Francisco either.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Honolulu second worst city for traffic.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Which is interesting but I guess when you think it's kind of all by itself out there.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
And if they didn't build it right the first time there's not a lot of other places to build.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Makes sense.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Alright anyhow.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Actually I do have to agree with Prince Brightstar Boston is pretty bad.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Boston is very bad.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Seriously Atlanta is the worst traffic I have ever been in.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Bobby is Atlanta the worst yes or no?

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
No it's really bad.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
It's really really bad.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Alright.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Let me move on to some Nintendo focused stories here.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
First one is about Super Mario RPG.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Super Mario RPG is going to be a reward for Club Nintendo members.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You can get that on the Wii Virtual Console.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000
For 200 coins if you are a Club Nintendo member.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
That's on the Wii Virtual Console not Wii U.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
You can also get Maboshi's Arcade for WiiWare for 150.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
3D Classics Excitebike for 150. Wasn't that free at one point?

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
ArtStyle Aquia for 100 coins.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
That's on DSiWare on the 3DS.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
That's a cool game that I really wish would have a sequel.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Mario RPG?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Oh yeah absolutely.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
You might have 150 extra coins to spare if you purchase Super Metroid using coins.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Nintendo in a very interesting move decided to refund people who bought Super Metroid using 150 coins.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Because of the 30 cent promotion coming up on Wii U they decided to refund the coins.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
How kind.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
That is actually a very nice thing to do because I would have thought people should have been smarter and known that that was coming.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
But that's pretty cool.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Good on you Nintendo.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
And now you can use the coins to go buy a game that's almost as good as Super Metroid but not quite.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Because Super Metroid remember is greater than your favorite.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Alright and lastly when it comes to E3 this is really no surprise at all.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Reggie Fils-Aime and Shigeru Miyamoto are going to be hosting the pre-E3 presentation.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I mean duh right? Like those are the big personalities at Nintendo.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
The biggest shock is that they say presentation.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Not a million presentations.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Well but there could still be future ones done by others.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I mean it's not always just the two of them in the videos.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
I've seen plenty of other people in there.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Including one J.C. who I knew back in the DDR days.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
They may have one before E3 and then a million during and after.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Okay I see I see.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
A custom tailored Nintendo Direct.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Alright.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:29.000
The presentation will be to selected media and it's going to take place before the show floor opens to the public.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Once the presentation is over members of the press gets to test out the titles before anyone else.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
That's what they're doing.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
They've already announced that was what they were doing.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
But I'm saying that Reggie Fils-Aime and Miyamoto are hosting it.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Well cool.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Which is no surprise I'm sure.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I'm sure his body is ready.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I wish I could get in. Me too. I want my body to be ready.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Alright Dark Sakura.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Sorry I was complaining about Florida cops.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Apologies to any of our listeners who is a cop in Florida. I know you are not all assholes.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Okay.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
So coming to the 3DS eShop is a Sonic Hedgehog.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Which is good news for everybody who is interested in playing that on your 3DS.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.000
It's actually even got the Genesis model 2 audio.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Which you can listen to as well.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
And there's also and this makes me pretty happy.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Dou Dompachi Saitai Ojo will be out for 360 and it will be region free.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
So I can import the shit out of that.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I mean basically since it's pretty much not being localized you can just import it.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
And that makes me super happy because I love Dou Dompachi.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And then last but not least GameStop is not going to be taking PS2 trade-ins anymore.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Even though they will still be selling the games.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:03.000
As of June 1st they will not accept the console or related products for trade.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Assholes.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000
They're very excited about the PS4.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Let's be real though. I mean it's not so much that they're assholes.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
They just need the shelf space.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
But not because of this.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000
No. I think that they're missing out on a market.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Or they're going to be closing off an area of revenue.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
But I think they're... I don't know. I just don't think it's very wise.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Well the flea markets will pick it up and the other retro game stores.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Like fair game and game trader.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Fair game is local in Sacramento but they are really awesome.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
The one up the street here closed.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Even though you can still look inside it on the Google Maps thing which is creepy.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Funny.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Super creepy.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Which makes me wonder how old most of those pictures are.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Go figure.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Alright. Well if that does it for Dark Sakura's rapid fire news.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000
So we're going to go to the foogle question of the week.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I rapid fired that.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
That's not the right theme song. What are you doing wrong with it?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Geez rap.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Facebook.com or Google Plus.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Slam those words together you get foogle plus.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
But it's foogle.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Tonight on foogle.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
We plugged the interview we had in our first half with Joe.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000
The creator of it's dangerous to go alone the movie.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
And we thought since this was a documentary all about the Legend of Zelda.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
We're going to ask our listeners this week.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.000
What's your favorite memory of the Legend of Zelda series?

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
This could be something that happened in the game.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Or a memory you have about playing it.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
We want to leave it wide open.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
So let's go to some of the answers on Facebook first.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
We'll start with Jeremy from the Koopa Club podcast.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I like them. They're fun.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
One of my biggest and happiest memories from childhood.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Was playing the original NES Legend of Zelda.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
With my older brother and sister.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
We are not what I'd call a close family.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
And we don't really have much in common.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
But that game brought us all together as hokey as it sounds.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Exploring the dungeons.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Bombing every wall. Trying to burn every bush.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
It was an amazing experience for me as a five year old.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
I remember going around trying to set every single bush on fire in the game.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Because you want to see if there's any more secrets.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Did you do that in Dark Soccer? Did you set everything on fire?

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Oh I did and I bombed everything.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
And I tried to grab every single rock possible.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And I would bomb every wall.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I would run into every wall in a dungeon to see if I could walk through it.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I remember finding out on my own.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I remember finding out on my own that like the first five dungeons?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
It might not be that many. It might only be like three or four.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
You can bomb every single solitary wall.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
That adjoins to another room.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
But that doesn't work later on.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Just because a room is next to it doesn't mean you can bomb through it.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I know. Cool story.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000
I also think it's very cool that you were playing games that were as cool as Zelda with your family.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
My mom didn't understand Zelda.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
You know what my mom would play though?

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
The one game my mom would...

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
And she wouldn't pick up the controller but she'd just bark at me what to do.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Like, do that Rob. Do that.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Anticipation.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Do you remember this?

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Yeah.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
It was the little drawing game that was the board game.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I remember it.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000
And they would draw the little pictures and my mom would just sit back in the chair and go,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
It's a trumpet. Rob. Rob, buzz in. It's a trumpet.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
It's a trumpet, Rob.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Alright.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
We need to get your mom back on the show.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Today would be a good day for that.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
I did say Happy Mother's Day at the top of the show, right?

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I really hope so.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Yeah.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Alright.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Just making sure.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Oh, I know it's also Bobby's birthday.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
So, alright. Anyway.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.000
If I neglected to do so in the first half, a Happy Mother's Day to all of the folks celebrating today.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Whether you are yourself a mom or have somebody who is celebrating.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Back to the Facebook question of the week.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Fugu question of the week.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Xplink says,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
The first time playing Legend of Zelda for the first time it came out, after it came out,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
and trying to help my friend beat the game.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Playing it for hours on end, going through and trying to find all of the dungeons.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Called the Nintendo Power Hotline just to get help for it.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
And yes, my mother gave the OK for it.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Thus why I have the name Link for my handle.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Although the X-Link is a different story.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Well, I never knew that the Link part of that came from Zelda.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Remember when you had to get permission to call the tip line?

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I never got.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I never did.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Yeah, I never.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Well.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
We had some long distance phone bills at my house.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
I never got said permission from my mom.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
And so, you know, it was like, Rob, you are not calling Washington.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
You don't need to figure it out.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
You can figure it out, Rob.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I'd be like, Grandma, I'm calling that Nintendo line.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Why don't you write them a letter?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
You only can talk to them for 10 minutes.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
That was seriously.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I have to.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I have to.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I need to actually talk to my mom so I have my accent.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
You only got 10 minutes to talk to those people and then you got to hang up.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
I don't care if they're halfway through conversation.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Yes, ma'am.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I did get permission later on to call the official Sierra bulletin board system, which was a long distance call.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
So I could download, like, King's Quest demos or something.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Alright, anyway.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Back to Foogle.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
And Matt J. on Facebook says,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000
The Zelda series, along with Metroid, has always held a special place in my heart.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
The first Zelda title I ever played was A Link to the Past.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
It, along with Super Metroid, cemented my love of gaming.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.000
One of my greatest summers as a child was 1995.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Me and my two best friends at the time played through several SNES titles, A Link to the Past and Super Metroid.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I remember many a summer day playing through A Link to the Past with them.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Yes, it was a single player title, but it felt like we were playing it together.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
We would all huddle around my friend's small black and white TV, volume blaring as we went through the game.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
I remember us getting all excited every time we beat a boss.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000
We would take turns with the game, especially when it got to a point one of us couldn't get past.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Just getting through the game seemed almost magical.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
When you're 10 years old, getting through any game can seem magical, really.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000
It was a great summer, and there was something to be said about getting through a game together with friends.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Sadly, I've long since lost touch with my two friends, but the memories will never die.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000
It was due to that summer I developed my love for Metroid and Zelda.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
That's a really good story.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I got a little, like for real, I got a little, little verklempt hearing that story.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Are you talking amongst yourselves?

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I might be.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Well, you know, there's actually a bunch of chat going on right now about, you know, everyone's big retro games.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
You know, playing with their parents.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And I was actually just recalling the cutthroat games my mother and I would have with Dr. Mario.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Cutthroat.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
She would get mad.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I think you're cheating.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
That's cool that you could play those games, because my mom would only play the game shows.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000
On Commodore 64, she would play Jeopardy and Family Feud with me.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
But that's really it.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Anyway, it's kind of sad the way.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Sadly, I've long since lost touch with my two friends, but the memories will never die.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I just want to play that song that will take you back to that summer.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Okay, if you get on the table and start dancing, I'm leaving.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
I'm just going to walk through the football field and pump my fist.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Yeah, I just began it.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Anyway, back to more Facebook answers.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
James S. on the Fubo Question of the Week says,

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Being six years old and finally completing A Link to the Past from start to finish without a guide, mind you, was one of my favorite childhood memories.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
It took my grandmother and my cousins about a year to finish it.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:28.000
To this day, I still play through it once every few years just to try and recapture that same magic from all those years ago.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.000
There's only one other game that holds the same magic and memories for me, and that's Illusion of Gaia.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000
They just don't make them like they used to, eh guys?

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Ain't that the truth?

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Ain't that the truth?

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Did you play through any adventure games, or was it just the competitive stuff that you played with your mom?

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Well, my mom really liked playing Super Mario Brothers a lot, to the point where I would be chased out of my own room.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
But she wasn't really into Zelda or anything like that.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.000
And when I borrowed my friend's, by borrow I mean, I borrowed it and he moved. Copy?

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
So now it's yours.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Yeah, well that's also how I acquired my Chrono Trigger.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000
He hasn't asked for it back. I actually keep in touch with the guy and he has never asked for it back.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:20.000
So, but I ended up playing through the first Zelda and my mom was like, you're playing that game.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Sorry, I'm looking on Twitter and I'm cracking up because Bobby tweeted a picture.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000
He's holding up the anticipation cartridge and he just tweeted, it's a trumpet.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I think one of the game pieces was a trumpet. I don't think that was actually...

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000
No, I think there was like a meta, like one of the answers then was trumpet. It was very meta.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Like later in the game it would actually draw a trumpet.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
I miss like good game show games like that.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
And then there was one versus a hundred. Don't get me started.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.000
You know what I miss actually as far as game shows go? Win, lose or draw.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.000
They're making draw something into a game show which is the same thing.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
I know, but draw something is actually pretty.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
But it doesn't have Burt Reynolds and Burt Conroy. Conroy? What was his name?

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Conroy.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Well it's just like how they made words with friends into a board game.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Or bejeweled into a board game.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Fuck, I just would play Scrabble.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Which was also a great game show.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000
You know what actually was also a good game show? Bumper Stumpers.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
That was a great game show. On USA?

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Chuck Woolry.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I sure do.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Chuck Woolry is the man.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
It was on USA just before up all night.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000
All right.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Sayo Surumagawa says beating the water temple without help when I was 10.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Wicked says not a specific memory in game but an entire game itself.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
It took every single thing that made the first Legend of Zelda good, multiplied it by 10,

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000
then took everything I felt was bad in it and nullified it.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
There was no bad in the original Legend of Zelda. What's wrong with you? I'm just kidding.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Zelda 2 maybe.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
I know people love Zelda 2 but ugh.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.000
The graphics were colorful, the music was orchestral, the control was tight, the design was brilliant.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Granted I haven't played a Zelda game past Link's Awakening,

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.000
but I have to say what I have played A Link to the Past is the greatest Zelda game ever made.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Ragenator says my favorite memory is beating the first quest of the original Zelda game on the NES as a kid for the first time.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Andy R. lastly on Facebook says when I was younger I really wanted Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:21.000
While I was visiting my grandmother my parents told me they'd buy me a game so off we went to the game store.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.000
The whole way there I explained to my grandmother how there were two games and how they were related and such.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Straight out of Nintendo Power I'm sure.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
When we got there my parents told me they'd only buy me one of them.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I picked one and we went home.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
That night I was playing it and my grandmother came over with a grin,

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000
handed me the other game, and told me to keep it a secret from my parents.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Aww.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000
That was so good. I'm like choking here. That's a great Mother's Day story.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
My grandma bought me a Killer Instinct.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
That explains a lot.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:01.000
She took me to four different stores to buy Killer Instinct until we found it at Rest in Peace Montgomery Wards.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
To be fair I had to- no it wasn't my mom it was my dad.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
My dad was the only one that would go to software etc. and all that with me.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
So when Mortal Kombat came out and all that.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
And I pitched a fit until they gave me my CD.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
You? Pitching a fit? Even younger?

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Girl.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Alright. Let's go to Google+. Just a couple answers over there.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
The first one from Rettertainment.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000
When we were kids my sister and I both had our own Game Boys.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
This was the original large black and white Game Boy.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
My sister broke her Game Boy by hitting it while she was playing it.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
My sister begged and pleaded with me to allow her to play with my Game Boy.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I said no because she broke hers and I was sure she would break mine in the same way my sister broke hers.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
After her typical high amount of whining and crying to my parents.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:49.000
My parents told me to let my sister play my Game Boy despite me being absolutely sure that she would break it.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000
My sister did end up breaking my Game Boy by hitting it as she was playing it.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
She was playing Zelda Link's Awakening at the time.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:02.000
This might not sound like a good memory but it is because I was proven to be right and I like being right.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I especially like being right when my sister and my parents are wrong.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Love it.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:17.000
And lastly Flaco Jones saying the ending to Link's Awakening was the best video game ending I have ever experienced to that point.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And still ranks up there with my favorite endings ever.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:25.000
The Ballad of the Wind Fish just adds to it by being the most memorable Zelda game moment for me.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I read every answer tonight. I shortened some of them a little bit for time but every answer if you want to see the complete answers.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLawnsRadio or Google Plus OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
It's not too late to add your response either because the people that posted before will see it.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
So great job tonight you guys.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
I loved some of those stories.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:49.000
The big memory ones about Grandma and about the two friends you don't talk to anymore.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
That got me in a special place. It did.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Alright. You alright?

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I was thinking about my grandma.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Yeah.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
You know what else she was responsible for?

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Was this the same one who got you Killer Instinct?

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Yes.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Oh wow.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I'll go ahead and just give the quick, quick story.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:11.000
She's got a dead hip socket, had three strokes and cerebral vasculitis.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Meaning that she has swelling in her arteries and veins and everything in her brain.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000
And two aneurysms.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
I talked to her the other day. She was just fine.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
And I remember that she also...

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
And I don't think she actually realized what she was getting me at the time.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.000
But she also got me my Kirby's Avalanche.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Which you know my love for all things peel, peel.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:44.000
She got me my entire collection of Red Hot Chili Peppers cassettes at the time.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Because I was super, super obsessed with Red Hot Chili Peppers.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Really?

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
In high school.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
And then she put up with me blasting Radiohead at all hours of the night.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
My grandma is the best.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000
And she would always say that she was trying not to spoil me.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
But she did spoil me pretty bad.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000
And she took care of me when my mom moved to Arizona.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
We'll give her a hug for all of us when we go to Alabama.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
I will. I will.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Let's move on with some more news tonight.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Loki.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Alright.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:21.000
So we've been kind of talking about how there's not a lot of games on the Wii U.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:26.000
And unfortunately not a lot of games from EA on the Wii U.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
And it doesn't sound like that's going to be changing anytime soon.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Because the brand new Frostbite 3 engine that they're going to be using for Battlefield 4.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000
And I think I want to say a lot of the upcoming sports games.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Like they're going to be going with the Frostbite 3 engine.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
That's where the next Mass Effect is.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Yes. Dragon Age, Mass Effect.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
They will not run on the Wii U.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
So.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Uh oh.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Yeah. That's not good.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.000
And I think, I mean, you could say that they may be able to port it to Wii U.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
If they created another engine that could ride it.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.000
You know, maybe like an upgraded Frostbite 2 engine.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Kind of like how they do with some of the Unreal 3 stuff or whatever.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
But is it really worth it to them?

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I mean, they're just kind of saying, do we really want to put this much effort into creating a new engine?

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
To only sell like maybe 100,000 copies, if that?

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Well then I bet Mass Effect 3 didn't exactly sell very well.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
But it's because there wasn't 1 and 2.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Well that and the whole preview, whatever the Genesis 2 was, was shit.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Utter shit.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Even if they just didn't have the gamepad functioning in 1 and 2, just port them over.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000
God.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000
But I guess it's easier for me to sit here and say, just cram it from that box into that box.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Just amp up the graphics in level 3.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.000
I'm sure they could have done that.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:55.000
But I'm willing to bet a lot of the reasons why they don't have games being ported over there is

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Nintendo probably requires a certain amount of connectivity with the gamepad.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000
And if they're saying, okay listen, you have to use the gamepad in some function.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000
That's probably why you see a lot of these games not getting Wii U ports.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000
YYR in chat needs some clarification. Are they developing the same engine for 360 and PS3?

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Or is this for the next...

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Wait, so 360 won't run on the Wii U?

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
That's weird.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
That's because no one cares about the Wii U.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Well I thought that they built the Wii U to be similar in structure to 360.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Yeah because the new game, Battlefield 4, it is a current gen release as well as next gen.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
And it will be running on that.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Well, if you can't get the next Mass Effect and Dragon Age games, why not get the next best thing?

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Converted smartphone games.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
What?

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Alright, well maybe that's not really the next best thing.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000
But it's something that the Wii U will have going for it.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:51.000
They're coaxing smartphone developers to adapt their apps for the system.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.000
This is according to sources, so take it with a grain of salt, but it's in the Japan Times.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Nintendo, quote, has offered professional use conversion software, quote, to certain app devs

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.000
in the hopes that smartphone software could help boost the Wii U's sales figures.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000
I'm assuming that's just to kind of boost up some of the eShop content,

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:18.000
which we've heard is very indie friendly to begin with, but I'm not sure that alone is going to save the Wii U.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:24.000
I mean, granted, a robust downloadable title stuff will help tremendously,

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000
but it's not going to be one on those mobile games alone.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I think most people who want to play mobile phone games will get a mobile phone.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Or already have one.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
That's right.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Or they'll get an Ouya.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Well, we do have some news.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.000
This is something that I thought was really cool, and I'm going to be checking it out.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
I haven't quite yet, but I've been reading up on it.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:57.000
There is a game called GeoGuessr that is, it basically uses Google Maps,

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
and it drops you in a location.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.000
And you have only a few, you can go a few blocks, you can walk around.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.000
It's sort of like you were, you know, kidnapped and got away, and you have no fucking clue where you are.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:18.000
So you use your clues around, and then you have a map, and you can pick on the map where you are.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000
And the closer you get, the more points you get.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:26.000
So you have five rounds, and so by the end of it, you can share your scores with your friends.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
You can be competitive.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:37.000
And they actually are saying on the GeoGuessr Twitter that he's working on other type of competitive play options.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:46.000
And there's this one scene on here where it's just showing a plain road with dirt around it,

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
and you have to figure out where you are, so it's really...

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Which is sadly what most of it looks like, most of Google Maps looks like if you really think about it.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Like that one that you're on right there, that picture?

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Yeah.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.000
To me, I would put that on the stretch between Nevada and...

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Let me look at this really big here. Does it say where it's at?

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
No, I don't think so.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Well, you have to use some educated. It's not in the flatlands because you see mountains in the background.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:19.000
That's what I'm saying, the stretch between Henderson and Las Vegas. Not Henderson.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:24.000
There's a big stretch of road that actually runs from Phoenix to Las Vegas.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.000
And I've been there, and it looks just like it.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
That could just easily be I-5, honestly.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
That could be I-5.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I don't know. Too bad you don't have smell-o-vision because if you smell cow death, you know you're on the I-5.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000
And you drive right past Kalschwitz.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.000
I like games out of Google Maps, though. Things like that. I like those little exploration games.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
There's so much cool shit on Google Maps.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:52.000
And to the Wii U's credit, that's one of the cool things I've enjoyed on the Wii U is that Google exploration thing where you can actually panorama around.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
But you know what I would love to see?

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Is a Google Maps integrated Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Now that's awesome.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Couldn't you see that? And you have to do the shop view to see if she's inside a place.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Oh, that's rad.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Okay, don't steal my ideas.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Patent pending.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Patent pending.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000
You heard it here first. I'm gonna be starting a Kickstarter tomorrow.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Except, wait a minute.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Hiring programmers.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
You don't own Carmen Sandiego, so...

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
I'll be like...

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
We're gonna do... I'm gonna be the star. It'll be Where the Fuck is Jamie now?

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
There you go. There you go.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000
So...

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
When in doubt, change the star to yourself.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Yeah.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Great logic.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Yeah, it'll be like...

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
You know, we haven't had an OLR dream game in a while. Maybe that's...

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
So that's our new dream game, Where the Fuck is Jamie?

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Where the Fuck is Jamie now?

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000
What do you think, Loki?

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
If you were gonna make this game realistic, it'd be in her pajamas at home.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Found her again.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.000
She's in the same spot.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.000
She's at 7-Eleven buying Guinness. Again.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Click. Click.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.000
No, no, no, no, no. I live in Citrus Heights. It's the Tower Mart.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Wait a minute. She's at Disneyland.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Yep.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Woo!

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
She dragged Dan to a Starbucks saying, coffee.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.000
No, no, no. We go to It's a Grind. Remember, it's near my house.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Sorry.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
No, no.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Why don't you just give the listeners your address while you're at it?

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Do you know what? Honestly, if we were gonna be...

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000
If we were gonna do, like, places that I actually go to,

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.000
it would be Disneyland, the Bravo Cheese Farms.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
And the computer room at my house in my pajamas.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000
And maybe Becky's house.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Prince Brightstar in chat says, needs a co-star Waldo-type character.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Well, that would be me.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
We'll have to put you in the beanie.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.000
And, uh, I don't know. If it was like a road trip locator thing,

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.000
then we can have, you know, Loki building Grand Theft Auto maps.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Frisbee says, have you tried checking Pinkberry?

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000
You know.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
You know, I was the mayor of three Pinkberries.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.000
I hate giving them all this free publicity, but that cookies and cream?

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Oh, my God.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
I need to go.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Oh, so good.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Because I'm...

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000
So good.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
I just haven't been given a fuck. We have It's a...

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
It's at my house in M&M's, which I brought some here.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Alright, anyway.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Yeah.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Hi, Loki.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000
You have something besides where the fuck is Jamie now?

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Yes.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Um, let's talk about Google Play.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
You know, going back to mobile phone games again.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Um, Google Play Games is apparently something that leaked out.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Uh, thanks to the Android Police.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Yes, that's actually a website.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000
And, uh, it's from, I guess, Play Services APK Teardown.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
And what is Google Play Games?

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Well, it's basically their version of Game Center.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.000
It's got all sorts of wonderful features, including, you know, in-game chat.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Um, they're saying that cloud saves, achievements, leaderboards, uh, invites, matchmaking, lobbies.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
All sorts of fun stuff.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.000
And, uh, that will be coming, I guess, soon.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
And maybe they're saying that, um, it could be even revealed this week.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I guess Google's IO event is this week.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Um, it'd be interesting.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I would be kind of interested to see if they're gonna kind of translate this into almost like a console.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
I mean, it'd be interesting.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
I know Google-

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Just what we need. Another console.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
We've already got the big three. We've got the Ouya.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Now we just had a report on this mobile phone console.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
There's too many consoles.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000
I do not want Google to make a console.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
I want Google to team up with somebody else.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Which, who knows? Could Microsoft team up with Google?

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
No, they're not really friends, right?

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000
But then again, to take out Apple, they might. Who knows?

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.000
I don't know. There's that Apple-Google rivalry, I think, that they would form an axis.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
To take down the mighty fruit.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Interesting. You know, Apple hasn't announced anything in a while either. It's been a very long time.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
No new iPads, no new iPhones.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000
They're taking a nap. They're taking a nap.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
A little nap? A little napple?

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
An apple.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Alright. Well, we know that-

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000
And Prince Brightstar in chat says, no love for PC.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Well, a PC- I don't know if that's in reference to what I said.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
A PC, I don't really count as a console.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000
But obviously, yes, all these games go on PC too.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I mean, there's some things you can only get on PC.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Like World of Warcraft.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Coming out soon is the PlayStation 4, which we'll be getting some games-

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Can we get well on Mac?

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000
That were on PC. Well, sorry. Yes. Yes, you can.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.000
PlayStation 4 is going to get Diablo 3, which to now is only on PC and Mac.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000
But PlayStation 4 is going to have that share button.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Where you can instantly share things to Facebook or whatever the PSN that's built in and so forth.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000
But something about the share button that's coming out this week.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Shuhei Yoshida, who is the president of Sony Worldwide Studios,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000
noted in an interview with 4Gamer, which is a Japanese site,

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000
that the share button is limited to what developers will allow.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Which makes a lot of sense.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000
You don't necessarily want people to be able to share everything.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:00.000
For example, like on the Vita, you can have certain scenes disable this.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000
So you can take a screenshot and the share function might share the screenshot.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.000
But you might not be able to actually take a video of the entire final boss.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:13.000
So you wouldn't be able to share the ending of the game two hours after the game launches.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Or something like that. So that makes sense.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.000
But what else I thought was interesting about the interview is that the video sharing function was inspired by

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:28.000
the fact that Shuhei Yoshida wanted to play Dark Souls all day long.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:33.000
So he would watch videos of other people playing the game since he was too busy.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
So that's where the share button came from.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.000
So that Dark Souls 3 or whatever ends up on the PlayStation 4,

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.000
he'll be able to use the share button to watch other people play.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
So he's a lawyer.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Maybe he likes to watch.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Well, he might like to watch, but we like to read.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
And every week you guys email us.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
DarkSakura ever so happily opens up the mailbag,

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
dives in and finds a few emails to read for you.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Right now, DarkSakura.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
You know what, every time I look at the mailbag,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Eddie Inzer's voice goes into my head going,

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
IT'S ALL STICKY!

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Hi, everyone at OLR.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
This is your friendly neighborhood rage-inator.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Unfortunately, I do not have any gaming-related topics this week,

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:24.000
but I do have some good news to geek out over.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:34.000
You could say I have some perfect news.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:40.000
As of 3.30pm EDT, on Friday 5-10-13, I am the proud-as-hell cat owner.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Proud-as-all-hell cat owner. I saw your kitty and your kitty is cute.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
I'm sorry, I was very busy when you messaged me.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I went to my local SPCA and adopted the most adorable 2-year-old male cat

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:54.000
at the SPCA named Anakin, who is mostly white with some black patches.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:57.000
I swear, this cat's back looks like a Rorschach test.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
It's awesome. You should name him Rorschach.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:04.000
But when you beg him for mercy, he might say no.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
I don't know.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000
He'll say meow.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Meow.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:13.000
He's extremely friendly and playful. Granted, due to the new environment,

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:17.000
he's been hiding under my bed for a while, but I'm sure he'll warm up to my place.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Smile heart.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I haven't had the opportunity to take his picture yet and upload it yet,

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000
but I'm working on it and I hope he'll be comfortable enough around my place

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000
by Sunday evening when your show airs and you three take calls

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000
that that way the three of you get to see him.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Now, I do like to propose a poll for your show.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Do I keep Anakin as a cat's name or do I name him after Booger,

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
the character from Revenge of the Nerds movies?

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
I still think you should name him Rorschach.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000
We're not polling it because Anakin is a clear better name than Booger.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
I don't know. I had a friend that had a cat named Booger.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I told you about Dan's grandfather, named his cats Hiss and Spit.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.000
And then I had a friend in high school that had a cat named Bitch.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
And I know someone now who has a cat named Asshole.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
But Bitch is a dog.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Irony, Rob. Irony. It's very hipster, okay?

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Now, Rob, I'll let you finish, but I have to say that I have the greatest kitty ever.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000
This email is brought to you by Fuzzy Wuzzy Kitties.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
No, you don't.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Come here, Sanrio. Sanrio.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Sanrio is under your bed.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Yeah, Sanrio hates people.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
I love Midna so fucking much.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Midna is super fucking adorable.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:30.000
You should just rename your Tumblr Fuck Yeah Midna because that's all it is.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
It's not all it is.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
You already have like seven Tumblr accounts.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
What's one more? You need a Fuck Yeah Midna.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
I actually made one for one of the fanfics I'm writing.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.000
See? How many Tumblers do you have?

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Fuck, hold on. I have my main. I have that one.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I have sleep waking, which is my art. I have an art history Tumblr.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
I barely have enough shit to post to one Tumblr.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
I have mass affecting. I have mass affecting.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
I have one Tumblr. Hello Robbie.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
If you want to follow me on Tumblr. Hello Robbie. R-O-B-B-I-E.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
I have seven Tumblers.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Do you really?

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.000
I really do.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:07.000
I wasn't lying. This is an intervention.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
You know what? Bite me.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:15.000
I did my art history blog just because I know not everyone gives a shit about

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Destiel and the Bauhaus movement, okay?

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.000
So I made that one and then Mass Effect started taking over my main one

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:28.000
so I made my Mass Effect blog and whatever. Don't judge me.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000
ActDeaf suggests name him Anagar.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Anagan plus Booger.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:34.000
You know I think-

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Name him Rorschach.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Now Alan obviously named the cats because they were already ten years old

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000
by the time I got in the picture.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
But I believed when Alan named Maruko,

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000
I think that was two things combined like that.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
I think from what he told me.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Okay and actually Queen Simeon in chat says Holstein.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Because he's colored like a cat.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Alright next email.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
It's a cute kid email.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Too many cats, not enough games. Although then again there's no such thing as too many cats.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
I was about to say, you know the rule.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
The internet is made for cats.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000
And porn.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
But mostly cats.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
And porn.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
And porn.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Cats.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
I see what you did there.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Cat porn?

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I like pussy.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.000
You know, don't get me started on the furry community.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.000
I love, no I actually really like fursuiters.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000
I love the care and attention that go into the costumes.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
There's just some art I don't need to see.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000
But they're welcome to draw it and I just won't look at it.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000
That's my approach toward any fandom.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
You can enjoy your fandom, enjoy your ship.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000
I don't have to look at it.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Don't get me wrong, I like Muppets.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I just don't like Muppets, you know.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Trust me, if it exists someone has slashed it.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
This is the internet.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Okay, this is from, I'm just gonna say Sam because I don't sign it.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.000
It's just Sam.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Hello O.L.R. Crew, I love the show.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Hi Sam, thanks Sam.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Thank you Rob.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:14.000
I say Nintendo should have checked with developers before the release of the Wii U to see if the console was good to go.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Third party devs have no obligation to make games for any system.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Nintendo may have to support their own console this time around.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Hey, Microsoft and Sony have also had their bad days.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000
I think we have also made that point on the show, I do agree.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Just because you have a system don't mean people's gonna put shit on it.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
In the story.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
They ain't got time for that shit.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.000
So, last email.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Hey O.L.R. Crew, I wanted to tip my hat in along with Loki and Sky's complaints about Nintendo's game from Episode 503.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Both of you brought up perfectly valid points and I want to bring up an issue too.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Namely with Nintendo not putting enough content in their games to make them feel, quote, complete.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:02.000
For example, Wii Sports Resort was touted to be a major upgrade from the first Wii Sports.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:10.000
I don't own Wii Sports Resorts, though after taking a look at the FAQ for it, I'm convinced it's just a small step up with all the new mini games included.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:16.000
I understand Wii Sports and other Nintendo games that typically star Miis are intended for casual audiences.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:25.000
But why won't Nintendo put in effort to toss in features aside from online multiplayer, like your Mii having stats that affect gameplay or a complete fleshed out tournament mode.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Not only would these features appeal to core players, it would give the casuals a sense of progress and an enticing reason to come back to the game.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:39.000
I actually agree with that. That would catch me playing it instead of, ugh, I hit the ball.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:46.000
For real, I really wish Nintendo would, it just pisses me off.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Nintendo needs to steal some people from Microsoft or even Sony that get online better, that get the enhanced value of it.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:02.000
It really, it just pains me that Nintendo won't try to advance the social aspect of gaming online.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:08.000
But then again, they made buku bucks off of party games, so you know what, whatever works for them, right?

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Well, it's also Nintendo which I think still refuses to, it's like they put, we're not crossing the line, we're not crossing the line, we'll touch the line but we aren't crossing it.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.000
We do things our way. We do things the Miyamoto way.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:28.000
I also believe my beef with Nintendo applies to some of the flagship games too.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:38.000
New Super Mario Bros. U only unlocks one extra world after you beat the game whereas Super Mario 3D Land put up another eight whole worlds that are substantially tougher.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Substantially. I'm all tongue tied.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:47.000
And how many people know that the upcoming Super Luigi U DLC only allows 100 seconds per stage?

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Really?

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Hearing that gives me the impression Nintendo is being cheap by not offering stages of standard length.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Well, we do like it long.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:04.000
OLR crew, please cheer me up by answering this question. What are some of the games you've invested an ass load of time into?

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Mouse effect.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:10.000
No, stay mad. I'm just kidding, I'll answer. What's the rest of it?

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I personally sunk somewhere over 2,000 hours into Phantasy Star Online a few years ago and more recently I played the Binding of Isaac for over 600 hours.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Stay fresh everyone and don't be a cudwafter.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Spelled like the type that cows chew.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Cudwafter.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Cudwafter.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
That's like gonna be my favorite game name ever.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
And that's from the Nasty Canasta.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
One of my favorite listener names by the way.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Cause I always just imagine a game of like Strip Canasta, like the card game, but anyway.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Strip Canasta?

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Cause it's Nasty Canasta.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
You know the card game?

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000
I know.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Alright.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
It's like Dirty P-Nuckle.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:53.000
P now P-Nuckle?

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.000
That's like your sister or brother would be Dirty P-Nuckle.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Dirty P-Nuckle.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Anyway, what was the question? You didn't even ask for that.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Fuck, I just closed it.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Oh, what game have you...

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Sunk a lot of time into.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:15.000
World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XI, and insert MMO here.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Mass Effect 3, a disgusting amount with a multiplayer, has really enhanced that.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
I'm actually gonna be starting over on the whole series again.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:28.000
I am going to keep Dramamine by my computer and play through the first Mass Effect again because I love the story in it best of any of them.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.000
But I get so damn motion sick.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:37.000
I turn off the film grain, I turn off the wiggle, whatever, the motion blur.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Still get sicker than anything on the stupid Mako missions.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000
What about you, Loki? Grand Theft Auto?

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Grand Theft Auto.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Alien Defense Force, Earth Defense Force.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Yeah, Earth Defense Force, Saints Row.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:56.000
We even called Diddy a bit because we played it for multiplayer, but I don't play a ton of that.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Probably Grand Theft Auto IV. It's a lot of fun. I don't know.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.000
It's funny that I was talking to Dan about me playing Ragnarok Online 2 because he's like,

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Well, you only played the first one for ten years, which is true.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Something like that.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Well, I played Ragnarok Online since it was in the Japanese beta because I started playing it in Japanese.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
And then I moved over to IRO when they opened the beta here.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.000
And then I played through paid IRO.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000
And then I went to free servers.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:35.000
You know, I'm actually one of the few people that would still have my original account intact because I was a beta tester.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Oh, nice.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Yeah. That was another one that ate a lot of my time.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Civilization 1. I played a disgusting amount of that on PC.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I'm not surprised at all.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Alright. More emails? Or was that it?

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000
That was it.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
I can't believe I didn't even say this.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:57.000
I would play Super Street Fighter 2 on my SNES all the time.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.000
I would have people over who were like, We're gonna play games. We're not playing Super Street Fighter 2.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
And it's like, Okay, Kirby's Avalanche.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Those were my two SNES days.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Good times.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:34.000
I have a few FUs because I have been carrying quite a bit of angst this past week.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000
FU number one goes to my stupid allergies.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
I have developed a weed allergy.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
And Dan brought me donuts last night.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
And I was like, Donuts? I'll eat the hell out of those.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Nope. Stick.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
And then to plane ticket costs.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Okay, get this.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000
New Orleans is a much bigger airport than Gulfport, right?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:17:01.000
But it would have cost me another 75 to 100 bucks to fly into New Orleans.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Which I wouldn't do anyway because it's three hours from Mobile.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Whereas Gulfport is like an hour and a half.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:13.000
And if I had flown into Mobile, it would have bumped up my plane ticket almost to another $300 because it's so much smaller.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:20.000
And then I was thinking, well, you know what? If I stay a full two weeks, you know, arrive on a Tuesday, leave on a Tuesday,

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.000
yeah, that's going to be a lot better for my cost. No.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I'm leaving on a Thursday. If I had stayed until Tuesday the following week, it would have bumped my ticket up by like another 150 bucks.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:37.000
It's stupid. It is completely stupid how much plane tickets cost.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000
And then all the shit you have to go through when you get to the airport.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
And 50 bucks to check in a bag and all that crap too.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Oh my God. You know what? I seriously looked at Amtrak, but it would have taken me a week to get there.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.000
And as much as I would love to ride the train, I don't have that kind of time.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:57.000
I even paid an extra $35 so that I could get the shortest flight possible.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Because the flights that wanted to give me the lowest price possible were something like 10 hours, including two layovers.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.000
And I was like, the moment I see the Atlanta airport on there, I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Atlanta airport is like the bane of my existence.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Don't tell me this because I have to fly to Atlanta for Dragon Con.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:23.000
No, Rob. Just one awesome thing, though, is the never ending escalator that just goes up.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.000
You cannot see the end of it for like an hour.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:29.000
I refuse to believe anything is worse than the Philadelphia airport.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Thankfully, I've not done the Philadelphia airport.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.000
It's pretty bad.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000
But I still think to this day my favorite airport for layout would have to be Burbank.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Oh, I love Burbank.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Burbank is so easy.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Burbank, yeah. That's what I always call it.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Or believe it or not, Dallas Fort Worth is actually a really well laid out airport.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:48.000
And you can get rides on the little golf carts.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Like, let's talk about airports.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.000
All right.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
OK. And then my last one.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Now, like I use this with a disclaimer.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000
I love my kitten.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
My baby is so sweet.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:04.000
But she had claws on her and clawed the crap out of my leg.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
She was pouncing my feet like I'd walk by pounce.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000
And then she decided that she was going to call up my calf.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
So finally we sat her down.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:16.000
And then she, you know, Dan's holding her and I'm trying to clip her little claws.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
And she's wiggling and moving her paws out of the way.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000
And making the most god awful noise.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
It was like this.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Oh, lordy.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Yeah, that noise.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
And I'm like, Mimi.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:29.000
And then she runs off.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
And the first thing, you know what she does once I'm done with her?

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
The first thing she does is goes into her room,

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
looks at her bolt and says, you're giving me a treat woman.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
So I did.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000
All right.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Uh, Loki.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Uh, I guess, uh, F.U. to be called.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
For not getting orders correct.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Fair enough.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Is that it?

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:50.000
All right.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:55.000
My F.U. of the week goes to the scale for telling me the truth.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Next time lie to me and make me feel better about myself, asshole.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:00.000
All right.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Let's get to a couple more news stories.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.000
And then we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:04.000
But first, Loki.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
So he has gotten some more funding,

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.000
not necessarily from Kickstarter, but from some outside investors,

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.000
including Nvidia, actually.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Nvidia is investing money in the as well as the Mayfield Fund,

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Shasta Ventures and OCam Partners, who I have no fucking clue who they are.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
But, um, yeah.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.000
So they've got another 15 million dollars, which will help them launch retail.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Speaking of which, their retail launch, as I expected, was delayed to June 25th,

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:41.000
as opposed to June 4th, because there's no fucking way they would ever hit that target

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.000
with how fast they're shipping, you know, the Kickstarter backers.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.000
And on top of that, the people that preordered on Ouya.tv.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:57.000
And they say they have 12,000 developers who registered to make an Ouya game.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
So that's not necessarily 12,000 games that are out there,

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:04.000
but 12,000 people that are, yeah, possibly going to make a game.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:08.000
So, I don't know.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:12.000
They claim they're ahead of schedule, but I don't buy it.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
How much did you play your Ouya this week?

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Uh, for a little bit.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:18.000
I don't remember how long it was, though, but I checked out.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:19.000
What did I check out this week?

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.000
I downloaded this frog game that's supposed to be pretty fun.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:31.000
I played more of the Pingu puzzle poker, which I may be writing a review on that at some point.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
I don't know. I don't want to yet, because it's still, like, beta.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:38.000
It's not the finished game, so, you know, you don't want to do that.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I know I played some of that. I just downloaded some more stuff.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
I don't really remember playing any of the games.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:49.000
There's a few I tried that were kind of lame, but I don't remember exactly where they were.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Still haven't played Final Fantasy III.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
That's alright.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Anyhow, moving on to one more story tonight.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:02.000
This is about a comment from Bobby Kotick, who is the CEO of Activision.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Saying in an earnings call this week, where they were talking about the loss of WoW subscribers and so forth,

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:14.000
but this isn't about PC stuff or WoW, this is about console.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:20.000
This is about the new consoles, Xbox, Lube, Infinity, 720, whatever you want to call it.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Lubefinity.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Lubefinity, and the PlayStation 4.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Quote, there are still many unknown factors such as pricing, launch dates, and quantities, the level of first party support,

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:36.000
and, importantly, consumer purchase intent in a world where consoles are no longer just competing with each other,

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.000
but also with new platforms such as smartphones and tablets.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000
He also went on to say that Wii U had a, quote, very slow start,

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:50.000
and uncertainties in the next year could impact the performance of Activision overall.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:54.000
So, so far no Call of Duty ghosts on Wii U either.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Well, yeah.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:00.000
So, and I think, yeah, it's a very big possibility.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:06.000
I think, though, it's less going to be, oh, I have a smartphone tablet I can play with these games on here,

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
which no one's actually thinking that.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:15.000
But I think it's more of why do I need to buy a next gen console because Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out right then,

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:19.000
or, hey, I want to play Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty ghosts.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Hey, guess what? Those are both on current gen consoles or Assassin's Creed, you know, Black Flag.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Oh, current gen consoles, you know, or Watch Dogs, current gen as well.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.000
So it's like why do I need to buy a new console for these?

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.000
And they're going to have to figure out this whole what am I going to do with another console, you know,

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
when I want to play all the old games and they're not backwards compatible.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.000
They showed footage of Black Flag on the PlayStation 4.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
You can't tell the difference.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:48.000
You can't tell the difference between the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 version of that game.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:56.000
I'm sure it's other like simulation like physics stuff in there, but I all know.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
I can't really tell much of a difference.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:03.000
I lost my train of thought.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Maybe first party games. I don't know.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000
You know, that might help because, I mean, they're going to have some exclusive first party stuff,

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000
but that's what once again, it kind of sells systems.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
I remembered what I was going to say.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:20.000
There's rumors about this new Xbox, whatever it's called, that there's an HDMI pass through port on it.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Have you heard about this where, you know, you'll be able to save an HDMI thing because you can use the pass through port.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Wouldn't it be funny if that only worked with a 360?

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Because they could do that, right?

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:35.000
They could say, yeah, it's got an HDMI pass through port, but it will only work with the 360.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
It's an encrypted port or whatever.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:42.000
And a patch on the 360 will make it so that this is how we're going to solve the issue of backwards compatibility.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:46.000
You can patch your 360 through to expand the unit, but it only works.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
It won't, like you can't use the PlayStation 3.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.000
You can only use 360. Wouldn't that be funny?

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Of course, they wouldn't necessarily openly say that.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Of course, they wouldn't necessarily openly say that, but...

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
I don't think they could even...

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:06.000
They don't do that. In fact, actually, they don't really have an encrypted HDMI.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
It's PlayStation 3 that does.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:14.000
In fact, if you try to do video capture through HDMI, you can't do that on the PlayStation 3.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
You can only do that on the 360.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000
And I think you might be able to do it on the PlayStation 3 up to a certain...

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Maybe not 1080p, but I know you can't do 1080p through HDMI on the PS3.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
I don't see them doing that.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:32.000
It's still going to be very awkward with another console sitting next to your console to do backwards compatibility.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Just don't worry about it and just say, you know what?

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
We're going to drop the price of the 360.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
You have a 360. You don't need to sell it.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:42.000
You can just hold onto it and play your games on that.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I don't really know.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
I'm sure they'll have a solution for it at some point.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.000
I don't see it as that big a deal because I'm not really going to get rid of my 360.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.000
I'll just have another console.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.000
mm2k in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
I think next gen's coming out a year too early.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
You know, I'm starting to think so too.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:07.000
When these systems first came out, they started talking about this whole 10 year cycle.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000
I kind of think maybe it's too early.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
It might be.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:19.000
We may have a Wii U situation where it's just, hey, there's the launch titles and not a whole ton.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
I still think we're going to see some more.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:25.000
I think we're going to see more third party games, but I think it's going to be a lot of this.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:32.000
It's on PS4 and it's on PS3 because they're worried that, oh, we may not make up the sales on just a PlayStation 4 exclusive game.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:35.000
I think that's going to be a real big issue.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:42.000
You're going to say, well, especially if like if the Assassin's Creed thing, I mean, I'm sure it looks similar to the PC version.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Probably exactly like the PC version, but I haven't seen the PS3 version running next to the PS4 version.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000
So I can't say that it's like night and day, but it doesn't look from what they showed.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000
It doesn't look night and day based off the trailers.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:59.000
It looks exactly the same. But I mean, I think the trailers are captured off of the PC.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
So, you know, that's not surprise there.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:04.000
All right. Well, let's open up the Skype line, guys.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.000
It's the last we have on our list for the show tonight.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
But what do you guys want to talk about?

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:21.000
I just got an email on my little emails from Joe from earlier in the show thanking us for having him on.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:24.000
So that was a fun interview.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:31.000
If you missed the interview earlier, be sure to download it on the podcast feed or check it out on a streaming solution like Stitcher or TuneIn.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
One of your favorite apps there.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Again, 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call and say hello and talk about whatever's going on in your mind this week.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
All right. Let's go to the phones. Hi. Here on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Hi. Joe Zaku here.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Hey, Zaku.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Hi.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000
We see you.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:52.000
How's everything going?

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Good. Good.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Now we see you in studio. It's like you're here. What's up?

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Nothing much. Just catching up on some post Mother's Day gaming.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Dug up my old PS2 to play some San Andreas after like a three year hiatus.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Some classics. You know, my Grand Theft Auto 4 is still in the string crap.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
I can't believe you just called that a classic, Rob.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000
It is, isn't it?

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Have you not played Grand Theft Auto 4?

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Don't say you're old. I mean, you're talking about like a game that's almost a decade old. That's kind of classic.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Wait, what?

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Even like three and five city are pretty much classic at this point.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Dude, you haven't played Grand Theft Auto 4. Go play Grand Theft Auto 4.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:41.000
No, wait. I think I did a little bit. I don't remember. If I did, it was a long time ago when I first came out to play that.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Well, that one's playing.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:50.000
At the very least, if you're going to participate in the VOG gaming this week, you do need to play past the first few missions, I think, in order to get the multiplayer options.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000
I don't figure it out.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:58.000
I got really far in GTA 4 and then I lost my 360 copy, so now I have to start again for my piece, the one that I have on Steam.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Wouldn't it be funny though, Loki, if I started playing and I got totally addicted to it?

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
It's awesome. It seriously is.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:08.000
I do like hoes. I hear there's lots of hoes in Grand Theft Auto 4.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
No, no, no, Rob, you like ho-hoes. Those are different.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Hey, you're calling me fat.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Sorry, Zaku. So you're playing San Andreas.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Yeah, just catching up on that and basically trying to juggle my queue, but I digress.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:41.000
I guess part of what I wanted to bring up was the fact that the whole next-gen issues with some of the folks who are a part of it, like Nintendo basically,

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:52.000
bet the whole barn on the Wii U, and so far it's like EA's pushing back, Activision may, as you've already stated, maybe on its way out.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:05.000
So it pretty much goes to the point where did Nintendo intend for this to be a Hail Mary because they were getting outgunned by the fact that the Wii was so far behind its current gen?

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Yes, but there's a part of me that wonders if it's not a bridge console.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:18.000
And I threw that idea out because they invested so much in this gamepad and it wasn't just like the same type of stuff you saw on the Wii.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:27.000
I think if we had just seen literally a quote-unquote super Wii, it would have been more of a bridge console, which is what I honestly thought we were going to get.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:35.000
And then when we got the gamepad, I was like, oh, maybe not. But now I'm starting to wonder again, whether intended or not, Nintendo may have to.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:41.000
And I still think it's too early to say. I still think it's way too early to say, we don't know what this holiday is going to really look like.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Nintendo could put out those must-have games and sell fuck-tons of those consoles, and you may see new Xbox and PlayStation in hot water because they don't quite have that same thing.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
I don't know. It's too early to say.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:31:05.000
On the other hand, you know, the word on the street is that Microsoft actually at the last minute, it looks like they're going to ditch the whole always online requirement.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Funny how that happened.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:25.000
It works in their favor in the sense that Sony basically was forced to, you know, since the fact that they went early, it makes it easier due to the fact that you spread all these rumors around,

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:34.000
and then you create this atmosphere where, oh, we're not going to go through our competition console because such and such always requires Y.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:45.000
And then all of a sudden, they could just go in at the very last minute and announce, you know, all the things, pretty much dispel every rumor that's been going on for almost the past year,

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:50.000
and they could pretty much be on par, if not slightly above, going into E3.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.000
They could do that, but they probably won't.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:32:00.000
On the other hand, think about it. I mean, from what I'm hearing, it's pretty much the same, almost the same console.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:07.000
They're all going to be running Blu-rays. They're all going to have 8 gigs of RAM, although one of them may require more things than others.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:21.000
But if the rumors end up becoming true where they, like, ditch online, then that might just bring around some of the folks who are on the fence who pretty much didn't abandon Sony.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:34.000
But at the same time, they pretty much had the thoughts that, you know, if they had to go on and defend this lipstick on a pig by, you know, making sure, by defending always online, then, yeah, it would have been swayed to Sony.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:45.000
But, you know, if by E3, Microsoft basically, you know, pulls what they have to, and they could pretty much be neck and neck.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:33:01.000
It's almost like an election where, you know, you try to blackball the other guy, you try to throw mud, and then all of a sudden, you dispel rumors, and then you do something, you do an event where you're pretty much, you're pretty much even in the polls.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:06.000
That's how I think of it. Like, the way I see it in certain elections where...

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:11.000
So wait, you think Nintendo or Sony started that rumor about Microsoft always being online?

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I'm thinking it's Microsoft themselves. I mean, this is coming from their developer, not only, like, you know, third-party devs that managed to get their hands on the early dev kits.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:32.000
And especially that guy, that product manager that, you know, opened his mouth on Twitter, that didn't help.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Zaku, here's the thing about Nintendo, Zaku, I am not willing to write them off yet until, because if they price drop at E3, the game is afoot again. It's a whole new game, level 2, you know, it's 3DS all over again if they price drop at E3, which is highly likely, I think.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:58.000
But at the same time, it's starting to shape up like a two-horse race at this point, with Microsoft and Sony.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:03.000
And the fact that, you know, Microsoft has to, like, improve their quote-unquote phone numbers.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Will it, though? Will it be a two-horse race? Because now we're seeing that, you know, people might just keep what they got to play Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty Ghosts and all these other games.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.000
True, but two-horse race in the sense of the next generation.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Alright.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:26.000
That's all it is. It's just like, you're right, there is an argument to be made to keep what you currently have in this generation.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Hell, I'm not even, like, almost half a year into my PS3 right there that my girl got me this past Christmas.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:43.000
So, you know, it's still fresh to me, knowing the fact that I had, like, my other platforms to juggle before the PS3.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:51.000
So, I'm still chewing on that. So, may I get, you know, will I be getting one of those new consoles? Not likely. Not yet.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Usually, I just wait a while.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:57.000
I will, most likely, because I'm a consumer whore.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Going into this next gen, it might be a two-horse race.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Alright, well, we will see. Let's have this conversation again after E3 and see what happens.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Speculation right now.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Alright. Alright, Zaku, I'm gonna let you go to get more calls. Take care, buddy.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Bye.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Bye.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Alright. I think, you know, he's right. It's all speculation right now. At least that part he's right.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:19.000
It's all speculation right now. It's way too early to say.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Talk to us after May 21st. In fact, I think, wasn't that the Memorial Day weekend where we were thinking about not having a show?

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
That's, yeah, that's when I'm gone.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.000
You're not gonna be here. I don't know. We might have to do something something that week.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000
I'll be here.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000
It's not that night you'll be here.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.000
We might have to do something because that's right after the Xbox announcement.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:42.000
We got to talk about something. Even if Dark Soccer can't be here that night.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
She doesn't care about Xbox anyway, right?

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.000
X what?

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Yeah, exactly. Hi on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Rob, it's a trumpet.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Oh my God. Bobby's on webcam and he's actually got his cartridge. That's awesome.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
It's a trumpet, Rob.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Happy Mother's Day to you too, Mom.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Happy Mother's Day.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
What's on your mind, Bobby?

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
I just want to tell you it was a trumpet.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
I thought it was a drumstick with you.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Well, that one, there's no drumsticks in anticipation. It's a trumpet.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.000
I think there was a drum. If I removed...

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
No, because I would have played as the drum.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:23.000
No, no, no. Not the piece. The little drawings. Let me do a little drawing. Alright, alright.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:28.000
And when you put that game up to very hard, it's like, it would like draw one line and the computer would come in and be like,

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Oh, it's an elephant. How did you know it was an elephant?

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Because the computer always cheats.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Yes, so I always played on very easy and I whooped the computer's ass and I felt better about myself.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.000
And that's what it's about. It's about knowing that you kicked that ice cream cone into oblivion.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.000
That's right.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.000
That's right.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Bobby, I do wish you a happy anniversary of your hatching.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:52.000
Thank you.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Ah, yes. I hope you heard the birthday embarrassment at the beginning of the show.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:57.000
I did.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:00.000
I neglected to say it on your show tonight like a fool.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:03.000
That's right. I was hoping you would forget.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Your discretion was appreciated.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:13.000
I was too hypnotized by the music of Professor Shy Guy who was fun on your show.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
It's been Kickstarter night on VOG tonight.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Yes.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:19.000
So, yeah, everybody check that out because of that.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.000
He's a great guy. I've actually seen him perform before.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:26.000
And he was the person playing when GLaDOS made me get on the dance floor.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Oh, okay. I remember that story.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Oh, and now that all ties together because I know he was talking about Ella McLean, who is a confirmed guest of GamerX.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:40.000
So maybe I will finally get to meet her in August at that whole thing. I'm excited about that.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:43.000
And then you can name drop me and she'll be like, oh, yeah, I remember him.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.000
I will absolutely name drop you. I'll be like, yeah, we're on the same network. Yeah, good times.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:51.000
And then we may get Professor Shy Guy at Dragon Con.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Awesome.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Or our thing.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:59.000
I know we've got a lot of conventions coming up. Are you getting excited about E3 only a few weeks away?

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Not yet.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Not yet?

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Not yet. It takes a while.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:07.000
It's like right before anything because right now it's like I'm getting all the invites to things.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:11.000
So it's like now I'm trying to figure out what I want to schedule and what I don't want to schedule.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:14.000
And so, yeah, I'm playing all that game right now.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.000
I'm still waiting to hear back from the E3 Pope, but that's my own fault for waiting so long to do it.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:21.000
But, you know, it is what it is. But at least we're going to Disneyland.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Yes. Yes. I've already got my plane tickets and we'll be going. Anybody else going to join us on that?

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:31.000
It might just be me. I don't know. I would love to drag Dark Sakura, but I don't know if she's going to be game. We'll see.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:35.000
I will always go to Disneyland when I can, but I am the unemployed.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Here's the thing. It also depends on if I get blessed by the E3 Pope or not.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.000
If I do, then it will definitely only be you and me.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.000
But if I don't, then that opens up the opportunity that I can be like, hey, you don't have to sit around while I'm at a convention center all day.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Let's go to Disneyland for a day or two. So, we'll find out that answer this week.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.000
It better be this week. So, we'll see.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
So, I just wanted to tell you that it was a trumpet.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Plug Professor Shy Guy's Kickstarter as well as the Zelda movie Kickstarter.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Because I actually, the thing about with Joe, and I'm not going to give details or anything,

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.000
I actually do know what he's going to be doing with the movie.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:21.000
I know the narrative and it's really an interesting take on documentaries is what he's doing.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:26.000
He told me that and then he later specifically said, don't tell people that yet.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Let that be a surprise. And I almost spilled the beans at one point.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:32.000
So, that's why I backed it.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.000
So, I actually have put my money where my mouth is if it gets backed.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
I think other people should back it.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:42.000
He's coming back up to Atlanta and I'm going to go down there and be a part of the filming there.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Well, apparently he loves Sacramento, so he can come back on the show when he comes in person.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Yeah, and I think he is coming. Like he said, Sacramento is one of the places that he may be traveling to.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
I will have to go check it out.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:57.000
What the hell goes on here? Maybe SacAnime is getting huge out here.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Actually, SacAnime has been growing and there's another convention that started up, I want to say in Rockland.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Yeah, so who knows?

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:12.000
He's actually visiting actual people that did things. The reason he came up to Atlanta is because The Hero of Time was filmed here.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Oh, okay.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:19.000
Those creators were here and there were a couple other people that were big in the Zelda community that, listening to his interview,

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:24.000
he may have actually had to drop their involvement for legal reasons, but they were here in Atlanta.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:32.000
So, when he came into Atlanta, he actually was here to talk to three different Zelda fan groups that were all based in Atlanta.

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:38.000
And he's coming back because the Symphony of the Goddesses is performing in Atlanta and he's going to do some follow-up stuff with them

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.000
and do some more follow-up stuff with some of the other Atlanta people as well.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:47.000
So, he's kind of more meeting the people rather than really going to conventions.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.000
He's just now starting to go to conventions, but he also might be at DragonCon as well.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Sure. Makes sense. Makes sense. Alright.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Well, Bobby, anything else you want to plug or talk about while you're here?

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:03.000
No. You guys may want to tune in June 2nd during our shows.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:06.000
For a little something something.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Dot dot dot.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Dot dot dot. Exactly. To be continued.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.000
To be continued.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000
What would June 2nd mark the one year anniversary of? I'm trying to think.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:14.000
I don't know.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:17.000
I don't know. Alright. Alright, Bobby. Always a pleasure to talk to you.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
June 2nd, 2012?

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Yeah.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Maybe the one year anniversary of that. That day is...

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Oh, shut up, Logie. Alright. I'm going to let you go, Bobby. Take care.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Alright. Bye. Always a pleasure to talk to Bobby Blackwolf.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.000
He's always good enough to have us on his show every week.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
So, it's always nice when we can return the favor.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:39.000
1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.000
I want to do Twitter topics, too. I'm like, where's my iPad? Where's my iPad?

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Oh, it's in the iCades. Let me just get that out of there.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:50.000
You know what? You don't even have to lift that thing to get it out.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Oh, I always do.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Yeah. I've...fingers.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
You're saying I should just finger it a little bit?

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Yeah, you need to finger it, Rob.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Alright. I will. I'll finger it next time.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Alright, before we get to last minute stories with Logie, let's try to take at least one more call here tonight.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Hi, Akdeft. How you doing?

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Really fine. And you?

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Good. What's on your mind tonight?

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Well, I wanted to just say that I backed up the Zelda Kickstarter.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Oh, hey. Hey, I'm glad to hear our show is helping and that it actually does help spread the word.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:29.000
What made you decide to pitch in and help?

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Well, I already had read Bobby's article on VOG, so I pretty much had the intention of doing so.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:49.000
But while you're interviewing the guy, John, I think, he pretty much has a great idea here.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:43:00.000
His project seems like a really, really interesting thing to do, especially for something that many people like, like Zelda.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:13.000
And something that he probably mentioned that really strikes me really good is that, for example, you're here because of video games.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:25.000
And one of them was Zelda. And you were inspired by video games to do your show, not to mention Bobby and many other shows on VOG and other podcasts out there.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:26.000
That is very true.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:35.000
It doesn't mention me that I do the I Love That Song articles on VOG. Video games and video game music inspired me to do that.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:48.000
So, yeah, I do have Zelda in part to think of that. So, I really want to see more of the fans rather than just the history of Zelda and its creation.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:54.000
I want to see how people were affected by this game.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Now, of course, in some ways, I think this particular show, you would have to credit Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania a little more so.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:09.000
But, I mean, the honest reality is, would I have ever played those games or been into gaming at the first place if it wasn't for the great classic 8-bit games that kind of paved the way?

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:12.000
I don't know. And certainly, Zelda played an influence in that.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:19.000
So, it's, you know, it's, I like to answer that question a lot, too. It kind of made me go, oh, yeah, it's true.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:25.000
You know, there is a lot of inspiration for what I'm doing every Sunday night that comes from games like Zelda and so forth.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:31.000
Yeah, and I really want to see this project finished or at least backed up.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Though it has a long way to go, but I think that if people understand what the meaning of this project is and not necessarily think, oh, it's going to be about Zelda and, oh, my God, they're going to prop it up, Nintendo, and do something wrong with it.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Or maybe the instant assumption that it's going to get shut down is a little bit silly, too.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:03.000
I mean, if it was going to get instantly shut down, I think it would have been already.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:08.000
And I think, again, you know, you look at something like King of Kong, Donkey Kong was a Nintendo game, too.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.000
And it happened. So, you know, there's ways he can do it.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:20.000
And he sounds like he's got his, what did he say, he's dotting his lowercase J's or whatever he said that, you know, he's got it explored with the legal team and so forth.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:24.000
He's ready to fight for his movie if he has to a little bit.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Yeah, I don't think he has any legal problems at least because of the material.

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:42.000
So it isn't like he's taking explicit, sorry, Nintendo property to, for profit or something like that.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:47.000
So I think he's going to be fine in that sense.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:51.000
The fans, that's what I'm worried about.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:46:02.000
But like I said, if they understand the meaning behind this project and understand what it is exactly, I think that it will get a higher response.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Well, you know, that's part of the reason why we had him on the show tonight to kind of get people talking and more people looking.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:14.000
And, you know, maybe even if just a couple folks friend the thing on Facebook and then share it with their friends,

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:20.000
that's going to be exposure to possibly, you know, thousands more people that didn't see it before, possibly.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.000
So a lot of it is about getting the word out. So we'll see what happens.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:28.000
But I do plan on backing it myself, that and the Professor Shy Guy one.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.000
I'll give him some money too. I think that was pretty cool. So, all right.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Yeah, that project too seems pretty good to back up to.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:40.000
All right. Well, Akdeft, any other quick thoughts before I let you go?

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Nothing more. I sent you a Twitter topic. I don't know if you read it already.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:50.000
I am looking at it right now. But since you brought it up, I'll go ahead and talk about it with you here.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Let's see. You tweeted us and it says Skullgirls items for Team Fortress 2.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:59.000
They are up on the Steam Workshop for fans to vote and approve so they can be pre-order items.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
So what sort of items do we have to look forward to?

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:06.000
They're basically hats and you know what, for TF2.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Of course.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:10.000
They're pretty cool. They're pretty well designed.

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:13.000
It wouldn't be Team Fortress if they weren't hats.

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:24.000
These items actually were rewards for the indiegogo they had for the DLC characters and the PC version.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:34.000
But Valve said to them that they had to approve first of the items and then see if they can release them as pre-order incentives.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Though now they have not a green light, but basically that fans have to approve of the items so they can be put as incentives of pre-orders.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:54.000
And also the backers of the project up there.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Alright. Well, check that out on the Steam store in the community section.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:04.000
And lots of cool add-ons for games out there. I really love how Steam has been expanding that.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:08.000
You know I love me some Mass Effect Civs in Civ 5.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Alright. Well, Act F, I'm going to let you go so I can get these other Twitter topics and wrap up the show.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:13.000
But have a good one, buddy. Okay?

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:14.000
You too. Thanks.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Alright. Bye.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Alright. I'm going to close up the Skype line for now.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Sorry if you didn't get through tonight, but remember you can always email us.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Or you can tweet us and I'll get to last minute stories here in a minute, Loki.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
But first, I thought I'd quickly go through these Twitter topics.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:36.000
sj100matt tweeted us about ESPN ranked the best sports video games of all time.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Here are the top five.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:41.000
WWF No Mercy, number five.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:44.000
MVP Baseball, 2005, number four.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Mike Tyson's Punch Out, number three.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Yeah.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.000
NHL 94, number two. Yeah, that's a pretty good one.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Tecmo Super Bowl, number one.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Clearly.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:56.000
Yeah.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
Clearly. I mean, you can't argue with that.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.000
You know what? I still like Super High Impact.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Also, this list is badly needed. Now, I don't see if there was maybe a six through ten.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
There are no Blades of Steel.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Blades of Steel is not here.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Yeah.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:13.000
And NBA Jam, which I think would have been a worthy addition, is not here.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Depending on the version of NBA Jam, because there are some shitty versions.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Yeah, not the new one. Not the new one.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:23.000
Well, if you want like the hardest home version ever, you want to look for the PlayStation Tournament Edition.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:27.000
How much is the original arcade version? That's the one I would do.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:32.000
So, okay. Very interesting. But I'm okay with Tecmo Super Bowl being number one.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Even though I don't play a lot of sports video games, I think it says a lot that I think I have played at least three if not four of the games on that list.

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:43.000
So, I think that says a lot as to why they are the top five.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Some other tweets here from Tigerclaw. Defiance, the TV show.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:51.000
Tigerclaw tweets us saying Defiance was renewed for a second season.

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:54.000
That shocked the hell out of me because this is a sci-fi show, isn't it?

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:55.000
Yeah.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:00.000
I actually downloaded the first four episodes to watch. I haven't watched them yet because shit's been happening.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
I think quite a few people have been watching it.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
Yeah, I hear a lot of people talking about it.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:09.000
I did read over the Wikipedia article on it and it actually seemed really interesting.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:15.000
I watched on Netflix three episodes of Scandal last night, which has nothing to do with sci-fi.

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:20.000
But I bet Nellie would watch Scandal because it's by the chick who does Grey's Anatomy, which I'm almost embarrassed to say I watched it.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
But it's pretty good.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Yeah.

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
It's pretty good. It's pretty good, Loki. Scandal's pretty good.

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.000
I still want to know what the thing is with Nellie and her Tyra Banks obsession.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:33.000
It's not all the crappy McSteamy stuff from Grey's Anatomy, though.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
This is about, you know, this...

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
She's on the last season of Grey's Anatomy.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Is she? Oh, is she?

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:41.000
She's finishing up, yeah, the last season. Or this season.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
Oh, this season is the last season.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
Yeah, the last season she can watch.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:50.000
One more tweet from Tigerclaw and this is about a Capcom promotion for Resident Evil.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Filling a pool with blood and gore.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Well, you know this came from the UK marketing department.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:00.000
It was the first blood-filled swimming pool.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Good lord. It's going to have 55,000 gallons of water, and I'm using the little quotey fingers, featuring...

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
With corn syrup and red food coloring?

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:17.000
I'm sure. Fake human torsos as flotation devices, intestines as lane markers, and all kinds of gruesome objects floating in the water.

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:23.000
The event is near London's Olympic Stadium, but not actually there. That would be weird.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:34.000
It will be... You can get the tickets for free on Monday, May 20th, but only 200 are given out each day leading up to the pool's opening on May 25th and 26th weekend.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Memorial Day weekend, although I guess maybe that's not a thing in the UK.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:41.000
If you're under 18, you need to have a parent.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Whatever. That sounds whack.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
You know what?

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Really, there's nothing quite like bathing in the blood of fresh virgins.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Well, now you can.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
But only if it's real blood.

02:51:53.000 --> 02:52:00.000
And it actually is really, really good softener for your skin, to say, and a facial made out of that.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:04.000
That would be concerning if it was real blood. This is just stupid.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Well, the meat market thing was stupid, too.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:08.000
It's just like, really?

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Why is it always UK stuff?

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:11.000
Really?

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Because if they did it over here...

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:18.000
I mean, no disrespect to our overseas friends, but y'all are crazy.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:22.000
You know that the Scottish diet was built on a dare, right?

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:28.000
I bet it was Dutch influence. I bet it still had something to do with this. I'm blaming the Dutch.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
I don't blame the Dutch.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:33.000
I don't know, any place where, you know, blood pudding...

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Where black pudding is served regularly, I don't know.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Alright, Loki, any last minute stories?

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:46.000
No, unfortunately I don't have any last minute stories because I'm busy cramming to write an article that will be on the website tomorrow.

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:50.000
And I just realized, hey, you know what, I'm not a very good writer, so...

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
It's challenging.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:53.000
It is very challenging.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:54.000
I could be your editor.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:58.000
No, that's alright. We don't have time for multiple editors.

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
It's write and send to somebody.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:03.000
I'll talk to you off air. There's always plans.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:10.000
Anyhow, so if there's no last minute stories, then I guess it is time to wrap up the show, which is fine because it's about 9 o'clock anyway.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:13.000
Let's go around and wrap up.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Thank you guys all for listening and tuning in tonight.

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Remember, if you like the show, please help spread the word about the show.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:24.000
Give us a nice five star review on iTunes or a thumbs up and support independent podcasting.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:29.000
You know, there's a lot of indie broadcasters out there that work very hard at what they do and we really need your support.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:36.000
Not all of us can just snap our fingers and have people pouring money onto us.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:45.000
And I'm not asking for your money, but we don't have that luxury where we can do that and just have money poured onto us to buy promotion and other things for our show.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:49.000
We're not afforded that luxury in the independent community, so word of mouth is so important.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:53.000
So all we ask, we're not asking for your money, we're just asking for your word of mouth.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:54.000
Tell a friend about the show.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:57.000
Help grow our community because community is our motivator.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:00.000
And the more motivation we have, the better.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:04.000
Meanwhile, we'll go around and give everybody everybody's final thought.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:07.000
And why don't I start with you, Loki? What's your final thought tonight?

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:18.000
My final thought is be sure to check out our VOG gaming night Thursdays, 8 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:21.000
I don't know if it's going to stay on that day, but maybe.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:24.000
I think that's the most convenient day. It doesn't conflict with anybody else.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:28.000
I know it's a little bit late on the East Coast and beyond.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.000
But this week, Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:39.000
If you don't want to play that game on 360, be sure to go to our forums and let me know what game you do want to play.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:45.000
And we can try to work that in because I've been asking and no one's going to say anything except for Bobby.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:49.000
Which is kind of shocking to see Bobby recommend Grand Theft Auto.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:50.000
But it's going to be a lot of fun.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Because he wants you to show off your elite skills. He's hoping to learn a thing or two.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
I'll climb some skyscrapers.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
I bet you will.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:01.000
My final thought is I would like to play Where the Fuck is Jamie Now?

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
Oh, but she's right here at my table.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:04.000
You win!

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:05.000
Yay!

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:06.000
Here, have some trail mix.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
That stuff is addicting. Damn you.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:09.000
I just threw it together.

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:12.000
Damn you, coconut. I'm trying to lose weight, not gain it.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:15.000
You know what? The coconut is actually not very sweet.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:16.000
And super fatty.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
It's good for you. Eat it!

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:21.000
It's a trumpet, Jamie. It's a trumpet.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
No, it's not. It's actually Reese's Pieces.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:29.000
My cat is insane and she doesn't know what is right.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:34.000
No, seriously, I think that...

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:38.000
Is it a full moon or something? Because Midna has been completely apeshit.

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
I have no idea.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:43.000
But I'm probably going to go home and get pounced again.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
So, who knows what's going to happen.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Also, I am doing a live streaming Mass Effect 3 with my really shitty but sometimes funny commentary.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:59.000
From 5 to 8 Pacific time on my Twitch TV channel.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:03.000
I need to do some streaming. I feel left out. Maybe I'll stream tonight.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.000
You know what? We should do a post-Hoard House multiplayer.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:08.000
That is...

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:09.000
I will drink.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:10.000
That is probably a possibility.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:13.000
We should make Shane drink and I'll drink and we'll both be dunk.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:19.000
I don't think Shane is going to drink for another 5 years after what happened the other night.

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Sadly, I think the archive video has probably already gone off Twitch TV and we didn't export any of it.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
But it was good times.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:30.000
Alright, that's it guys. We're going to close up shop and get out of here tonight.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Thanks again for tuning in and supporting us.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:36.000
We will be back next week. Next week is the 19th.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
We will all be here next week for another show.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:42.000
We will see you then live or in podcast form.

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
Either way, you chose to support us this week.

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:45.000
Thank you for listening.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Have a wonderful night everybody!

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
See you next week!

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Thanks for watching!
