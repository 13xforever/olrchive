2
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:22,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April 6th of 2008.

3
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:28,906
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live here on our stream for the last time on Live 365.

4
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,627
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the last piece of live programming.

5
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:36,309
[SPEAKER_02]: But for you people that download and listen to our podcast every week faithfully, not a darn thing is going to change for you.

6
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:40,711
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do invite you all to come on and listen to a live show, participate in the chat room.

7
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:45,853
[SPEAKER_02]: The new place to do it will be www.allgames.com starting on Sunday the 13th.

8
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:54,986
[SPEAKER_02]: But meanwhile, we still have some of this week's news to take care of, so let's kick off this week's news for Part B with Loki.

9
00:00:56,187 --> 00:01:05,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's no surprise, with DualShock 3 being released here any time now, that they're going to be pulling the plug on the 6-axis.

10
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:12,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically throwing motors in those old 6-axis controllers that they have lying around and putting a new shell on it.

11
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:18,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, if you're looking for a rumble-less controller, you're going to be out of luck.

12
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:30,876
[SPEAKER_05]: However, though, if you want to get with the times and actually have a controller with that last-gen rumble technology in there, then feel free to head to the store probably now and go pick one up.

13
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:35,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Rostelia T says, That sucks.

14
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the six-axis.

15
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:40,284
[SPEAKER_02]: That comment from chat.orangelongeradio.com So...

16
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:42,399
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, good thing or bad thing about this?

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just kind of sucks because it's going to cost so much money to replace now.

19
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,941
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess new console owners won't really care.

20
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:55,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of anticipated this was going to happen, so I already sold back two of my controllers.

21
00:01:56,302 --> 00:01:59,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I just have two more now that I just have to replace.

22
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:05,803
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing is, though, now I think you're going to be fucked if you try to trade them in like GameStop or something like that because no one's going to want them.

23
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:07,524
[SPEAKER_05]: The value has gone down big time on that.

24
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:07,984
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

25
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:09,684
[SPEAKER_02]: No future games are going to support them, right?

26
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:10,916
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they will.

27
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:13,197
[SPEAKER_05]: It just won't have Rumble, probably.

28
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:15,617
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rumble will be disabled.

29
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:16,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

30
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:19,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's not the only thing Sony is doing.

31
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:25,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony is shutting down the PS2 and PSP gaming servers for some of the online games.

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Some games are no longer going to work after June 30th.

33
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's the weird thing.

34
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:33,402
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the games on the list is Amplitude, but I thought that game already went down.

35
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:36,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So, some of these games, I think, are already gone.

36
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:41,255
[SPEAKER_02]: JackX, Lemmings, PS2, MyStreet, Syphon, Filter, OmegaStrain, TwistedMetalBlackOnline, Everybody's Golf, PSP, Lemmings, WorldTourSoccer2

37
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:04,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

38
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,258
[SPEAKER_05]: But Twisted Metal Black Online kind of sucks, though.

39
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:35,199
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no offline mode for that.

40
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:36,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:37,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

42
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,061
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, those servers are bye-bye.

43
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:48,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if somehow old news didn't leak through as new news this week, and we're getting fooled, too, because I swear that Amplitude thing is like a year old.

44
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:50,325
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's supposed to happen on June 30th.

45
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:51,966
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

46
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:57,308
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP, I've never heard a PSP game shutting their server down, so that element's new for sure, so.

47
00:03:58,174 --> 00:03:59,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some wires got crossed, I don't know.

48
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:02,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was Frequency that was getting shut down last time.

49
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,477
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Frequency was never online.

50
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:05,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss Amplitude, though.

51
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:06,699
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great game.

52
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:07,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they'd make a sequel.

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish that my computer wasn't being messed up right now.

54
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:12,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

55
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:14,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you having problems connecting to the network?

56
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:16,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there it is.

57
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:26,170
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason, what happens is that, and this is just with my crappy laptop, is that I'll have several different Firefox windows open, and then one of them will suddenly vanish.

58
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:27,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun.

59
00:04:27,471 --> 00:04:27,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun.

60
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:28,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Cagney, Davis, Eastwood

61
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:00,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, so far that just looks like it's alphabetical, so whatever.

62
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,635
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's one called Cagney, there has to be one called Lacey, come on.

63
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,317
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be when they get to L. Okay.

64
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:10,241
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're saying that these patches are going to be coming out over the year.

65
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:13,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's good, they're going to keep the game fresh.

66
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:19,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of those games I played a lot for two days, and I'm just kind of collecting dust right now, which is too bad.

67
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:21,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,500
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

69
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished Saints Row, so that's awesome.

70
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:54,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday, right?

71
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

72
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,770
[SPEAKER_05]: So, let's see.

73
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other cool stuff.

74
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:01,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

75
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,532
[SPEAKER_05]: This may be cool if you're into Gran Turismo.

76
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:09,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you have, perhaps, I don't know, a younger sibling that you're trying to get into Gran Turismo.

77
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:15,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, there's a game that they were talking about a while back called Gran Turismo for Boys.

78
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:17,695
[SPEAKER_05]: It was going to be a kid-friendly game for kids.

79
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:19,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Turismo 5, The Standalone Game

80
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:57,606
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course when they were first announcing Gran Turismo 4 Boys it was revealed in November 2004 by Yakumuchi and kind of the way the hook pre-teens on cars I guess kind of like Hot Wheels or something.

81
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:01,290
[SPEAKER_02]: How exactly do you do that?

82
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is it just that the cars are a little more silly, or what?

83
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:05,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's a little more silly.

84
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:07,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, like, easier to tune, or something like that.

85
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:09,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they walk them through on how to tune the cars.

86
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:10,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I need that mode.

87
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:12,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do all that stuff in those games.

88
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:20,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much... That's why those types of games like Gran Turismo 4s aren't really for me, because there's too much of that car shop stuff that I'm not really into.

89
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:22,467
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not like Crazy Taxi.

90
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:24,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Just push the pedal and go, and try to drive into people.

91
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:26,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen that new game?

92
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,152
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be coming out in a couple weeks.

93
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:28,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh,

94
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Emergency Mayhem, Emergency Vehicles

95
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:57,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

96
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:58,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can do that.

97
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw the body into the dumpster.

98
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:02,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I would throw my passenger in the fire.

99
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:03,363
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

100
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,621
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

101
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,804
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're saying, the team at MadDoc Software is extremely talented.

102
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:41,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Bringing them within the Rockstar Games family will enhance our core technology and further support our commitment to creating progressive and innovative gaming experiences.

103
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:43,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So, another merger.

104
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,314
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the sound of the corporate suck-up.

105
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:50,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last game they worked on was the Bully Scholarship Edition.

106
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:51,779
[SPEAKER_05]: So, port.

107
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And a broken one at that.

108
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:58,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha, so it could be that more games are going to get ported.

109
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:02,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that Grand Theft Auto on DS isn't so incorrect.

110
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:05,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm down for Grand Theft Auto game on DS.

111
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:07,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see that rumor about it earlier this week?

112
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:08,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a misprint.

113
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:09,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do too.

114
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, something like that, they couldn't really put Grand Theft Auto 4 on the DS.

115
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it was top-down, which would be pretty cool.

116
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:16,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

117
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:23,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so now we're going to get into another segment here on the program and we like to do this every week.

118
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:26,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And this segment isn't going away or changing at all.

119
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:33,415
[SPEAKER_02]: We still continue to ask you guys to email us every week with whatever feedback you have for the program.

120
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:33,676
[SPEAKER_10]: We do?

121
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:34,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.

122
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:35,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it or not.

123
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:36,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

124
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:39,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and we call it our mailbag.

125
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:44,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send them.

126
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,760
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura dives into the mailbag every week and picks out a few of her favorite emails to read here on the air.

127
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you do, because you're going to do it right now.

128
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:51,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Or else.

129
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:53,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Or else you go in that dumpster.

130
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:54,565
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

131
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:56,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire.

132
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:00,209
[SPEAKER_06]: So, he knows Rob doesn't sing the intro for me anymore.

133
00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:01,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

134
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe on all games I will.

135
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

136
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:05,773
[SPEAKER_02]: On the fuck show I will.

137
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,701
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't sing the mailbag intro, I thought it was very... That was the Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

138
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:14,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was Let's Ask Orange Lounge, which we haven't done in a long time.

139
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we?

140
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,826
[SPEAKER_06]: We should do one... For our Skype segment, let it be that.

141
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:19,547
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean no Skype calls tonight?

142
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:22,349
[SPEAKER_06]: No, let them call in on Skype, but have it be Ask Orange Lounge.

143
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:24,010
[SPEAKER_02]: But they get to ask a question and that's it.

144
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,691
[SPEAKER_02]: If they do anything else, we hang up on them.

145
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:26,112
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

146
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I love that idea.

147
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:30,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So tonight's Skype segment is Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

148
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,837
[SPEAKER_02]: You call in, ask a question, that's it.

149
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:34,738
[SPEAKER_02]: You try to deviate the call, we hang up on you.

150
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:39,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering what your thoughts are on crappy MMOs, such as RuneScape, or that's pretty much the only crappy MMO I've played.

151
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:02,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not that bad.

152
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:06,576
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just full of grinding, so I guess the true question of mine is, what are your thoughts on RuneScape?

153
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:07,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never played it.

154
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:12,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, whenever I see, let's have tea screen name, I always think it says, let's shave tea.

155
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,961
[SPEAKER_06]: But that doesn't matter.

156
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:16,501
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you shave tea?

157
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:20,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Tea leaves, maybe you shave them with a razor.

158
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:21,384
[SPEAKER_02]: You and your logic.

159
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:26,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep up the great work, SkyDarkSakura and Loki, and I can't wait for the next podcast.

160
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,007
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's from...

161
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:30,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone who didn't put their name on here.

162
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:31,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's for person.

163
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:37,087
[SPEAKER_02]: RuneScape, the only thing about it, I'm looking at some articles about it on Wikipedia.

164
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,788
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks a little dated to me.

165
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:42,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never played it, but it's free, and free is always a good thing.

166
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,690
[SPEAKER_06]: No, free is not always a good thing.

167
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

168
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,250
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Yaris.

169
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:46,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Yaris.

170
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:48,171
[SPEAKER_02]: But this looks better than Yaris.

171
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:50,172
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you can customize your equipment.

172
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,192
[SPEAKER_02]: The characters look kind of funny.

173
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:55,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there's 150 different RuneScape servers throughout the world.

174
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:56,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It started in 2003.

175
00:11:58,231 --> 00:11:59,132
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I might have to check it out.

176
00:11:59,152 --> 00:11:59,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be fun.

177
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:01,093
[SPEAKER_20]: It's RuneScape.

178
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:02,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck RuneScape.

179
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:03,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Why fuck RuneScape?

180
00:12:03,294 --> 00:12:04,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you obviously know this game.

181
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:05,996
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of RuneScape?

182
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You get what you pay for.

183
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:09,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you like it?

184
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:17,804
[SPEAKER_20]: It's slow, it's clunky, it's a grind fest, and it has one of the worst communities I have ever seen in a game, ever.

185
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:20,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like it's set in the universe of Paperboy.

186
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on that screenshot, it does a little bit, huh?

187
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Paperboy the MMO, that's pretty rad.

188
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:26,649
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be awesome.

189
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:27,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd play it.

190
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:27,830
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

191
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,237
[SPEAKER_06]: and then you go to the Crystal Castles and you're done.

192
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:30,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

193
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:31,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email!

194
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:32,098
Okay!

195
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:34,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez, Rob.

196
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:34,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez.

197
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:35,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

198
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I like ordering the next email.

199
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to do that from now on.

200
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to order the emails.

201
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, watch me shove this ferret up your ass.

202
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew.

203
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,441
[SPEAKER_06]: This comes from... No, I love the ferret.

204
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:47,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't do that to the ferret.

205
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:47,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

206
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:50,481
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new segment.

207
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:53,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of an introduction to my email except for holy crap.

208
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a bit scared about what happened to Rob.

209
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:58,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you feel better and that it wasn't anything too serious.

210
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:01,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I feel better.

211
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:10,456
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to do something for me, just cross your fingers, cross your toes, pray if that's what you're into or what have you.

212
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:12,377
[SPEAKER_08]: And sacrifice chickens to your god.

213
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:15,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Light a candle or something that it doesn't come back and that it goes away.

214
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:21,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Because honestly, that's the most scary thing about it is that I still have a little bit of those pains and I'm hoping it's just on its way out.

215
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, Rob.

216
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:25,355
[SPEAKER_05]: We can help you.

217
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:26,876
[SPEAKER_05]: We've played plenty of Trauma Center.

218
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,616
[SPEAKER_05]: We know what to do.

219
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:32,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, video games teach you about real life and shit, right?

220
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

221
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, oh, hey, it's addressed to me.

222
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:39,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Ride and Rock Online 2, Gate of the World private servers are up.

223
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:43,465
[SPEAKER_06]: The one I play on is euphro2.com.

224
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:46,687
[SPEAKER_06]: It's E-U-P-H-R-O-2.com.

225
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:51,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It runs off Korean beta software, and only basic things are translated, menus and such.

226
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:54,658
[SPEAKER_06]: The soundtrack is also much better than the first Ragnarok.

227
00:13:54,678 --> 00:14:01,021
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is also completely different from the first as it runs in 3D, and you can change classes whenever you want, as long as your job level is over 5.

228
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And the game runs surprisingly a lot like World of Warcraft by interface and battle system.

229
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:15,827
[SPEAKER_06]: The private server has two servers, a test that's 100-100-100 rate, and a main server, I don't know what rates, assuming it has rates as their RO1 server, 3-3-3.

230
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:19,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that's from SakuraMax, and it says, waiting for something amazing to happen.

231
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised you're not all over Ragnarok 2 if it's out there.

232
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:25,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Not until I find translated copy.

233
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:26,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Like fully translated.

234
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:29,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm going to look into this one tonight actually.

235
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like soon though.

236
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:35,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to look into this one because I'm very interested and I've read up a lot on Ragnarok 2 already.

237
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:40,957
[SPEAKER_06]: But I tried to get into the official beta but I didn't have a Korean social security number.

238
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:45,781
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, Cheeseburger sent me a private message commenting on RuneScape.

239
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,424
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I played and one time someone was following me asking me for sex.

240
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:51,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

241
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:52,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be playing this game.

242
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:53,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like fun.

243
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:54,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

244
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, can I continue?

245
00:14:58,171 --> 00:14:58,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

246
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:58,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

247
00:14:59,192 --> 00:14:59,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

248
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:01,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR.

249
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:04,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been listening since episode 245, which I don't know which one that is.

250
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:10,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to tell you how rad your podcast, your postcast is, it says.

251
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:16,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I have laughed so many times listening to you guys, and my ears do burn when you mention anything to do with Australia.

252
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:23,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year, Loki mentioned a mobile game called The Coolest Girl in School, co-created by Champagne for the Ladies.

253
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:26,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually worked next door to Champagne for the Ladies doing freelance game artwork.

254
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:27,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

255
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:30,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki referred to it as GTA for Girls, LOL.

256
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:32,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the good work, pixel poison.

257
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:33,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is from Australia.

258
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:35,318
[SPEAKER_06]: It's someone from Australia, so that's cool.

259
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:41,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad we didn't offend all of our Australian listeners when we were... It wasn't a couple weeks ago, we just totally...

260
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody asked us what the capital of Australia was.

261
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what the hell happened.

262
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:47,161
[SPEAKER_06]: You asked me and I didn't know.

263
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:47,862
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

264
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:49,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever.

265
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:50,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Sydney.

266
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:51,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

267
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:51,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that much.

268
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:53,443
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.

269
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:55,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know my world capitals that well.

270
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:57,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Australia, but that's because I'm part Australia.

271
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:05,346
[SPEAKER_06]: They said that there's a two-year-old on YouTube naming off capitals of countries and all the states in the United States.

272
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:06,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?

273
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,627
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to grow up to be a crack whore.

274
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:08,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's two years old.

275
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:11,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you smarter than a two year old?

276
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:13,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

277
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:41,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Lord of the Rings-ish Epic

278
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:14,479
[SPEAKER_02]: But they'd have to put some money and some star power and some writing and all that good stuff and some special effects into it.

279
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,540
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think, Rice Princess, being the big Zelda fan you are, do you think that they could actually make a movie out of Zelda?

280
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course they can.

281
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,981
[SPEAKER_08]: They can make a movie out of anything.

282
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:23,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's true.

283
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:26,562
[SPEAKER_08]: They do sometimes, like, not well, but yeah.

284
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:28,862
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the trailer, like I said, it was okay.

285
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:32,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for what it was, an April Fool's joke, it was good.

286
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:35,904
[SPEAKER_08]: For like a real movie, no, I wouldn't watch it.

287
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:37,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

288
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,855
[SPEAKER_06]: They should do an animated one.

289
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,836
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

290
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:44,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a crazy idea I've always had.

291
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:47,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Sci-Fi Network, you know how they sometimes do those random miniseries?

292
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:50,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they did the Wizard of Oz thing not that long ago.

293
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:54,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're kind of low budget, but they're decent, right?

294
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:55,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a Lifetime movie?

295
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:00,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think they should do like a miniseries adapting one of the Final Fantasy games.

296
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,660
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure is boring around here.

297
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Squeenix would never ever let them do it, but I don't know, they should.

298
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,000
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of cool.

299
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Because The Spirits Within sure as hell wasn't a Final Fantasy movie.

300
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:15,142
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good movie, it just wasn't Final Fantasy.

301
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:22,824
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt would like to remind us they did make a movie out of Good Burger, so why not a movie for Legend of Zelda?

302
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:23,444
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.

303
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:26,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm going to keep going, alright?

304
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:26,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

305
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:27,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

306
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:29,366
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from J-Rod.

307
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:29,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Woohoo!

308
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:31,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

309
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,095
[SPEAKER_06]: June.

310
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:47,775
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out in June.

311
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:21,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get it if it has a custom mode in it, like a creator wrestler, because it's actually the only fun thing I like about those games.

312
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:23,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't know this.

313
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:31,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Sagan Chat says, in response to my Sci-Fi Network comment earlier, you do know that Sci-Fi was in plans to make a Myst miniseries.

314
00:19:31,543 --> 00:19:33,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not know that, but that would be kind of rad.

315
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:36,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Missed Online was interesting.

316
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:40,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of sad to see it go, but it took a lot of manpower to run that game, I think.

317
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:41,718
[SPEAKER_02]: But Missed Online was creepy.

318
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:43,520
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the creepiest MMOs I ever played.

319
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me think, what if Silent Hill was an MMO?

320
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,262
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be like this.

321
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:48,463
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be beautiful.

322
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:53,287
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you'd have to take a psychological exam so it could bring up monsters based on things out of your own psyche.

323
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:58,291
[SPEAKER_02]: RossDLUT would like to point out that Midway's website also lists the game being Summer 08.

324
00:19:58,611 --> 00:19:59,091
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

325
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:01,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I read the next email?

326
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:02,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email!

327
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,095
[SPEAKER_06]: It's freaking long, but I'm going to read it anyway.

328
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:07,958
[SPEAKER_06]: and this email was sent by DidYouLoseASock.

329
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:09,859
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't.

330
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:10,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wearing both of them.

331
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:11,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't either.

332
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,820
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the house.

333
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not wearing them now.

334
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:13,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm barefoot.

335
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:13,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm naked.

336
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:14,922
[SPEAKER_06]: My feet are naked.

337
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:18,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

338
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:19,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

339
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:25,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to an advanced private screening of the movie Postal by Yui Bull based off of the video game of the same name.

340
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Easily one of the worst films I have ever seen.

341
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:31,168
[SPEAKER_06]: EWI was at the screening and he is actually cool in real life.

342
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:40,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Before showing the film he talked about the reasons he made it and wanted to make a film that he would like himself and did not care what critics or other people would think about it and that's what he got.

343
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:45,904
[SPEAKER_06]: He also commented on how the Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler movies are all the same and they keep making them over and over again.

344
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:55,825
[SPEAKER_06]: and about how the film 10,000 BC critics hated it 9% on Rotten Tomatoes yet it made over 200 million worldwide because the money put into the advertisements for the movie.

345
00:20:56,345 --> 00:21:01,951
[SPEAKER_06]: He also talked about how he is not the only one to do poor adaptations and pointed to the films Elektra and Catwoman.

346
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:03,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Amen to that.

347
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:07,356
[SPEAKER_06]: He talked about a few other problems with films in the film industry.

348
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:10,599
[SPEAKER_06]: All the points he made were really great but his film still sucked in the end.

349
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:14,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Every religion and race is made fun of in this film.

350
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:18,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a live-action South Park with crude humor and morals throughout.

351
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:22,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Would the film have actually been good if everything was replaced with South Park characters?

352
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:27,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably, but then again, I think anything would be really funny if it was replaced by South Park characters.

353
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this film worth seeing?

354
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,816
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so bad that some might find it good.

355
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:37,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I might suggest this film over all those stupid spoof movies like Superhero Movie and Meet the Spartans.

356
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Iwi Bull in the past has boxed critics

357
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:44,995
[SPEAKER_06]: who would not like his films.

358
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:52,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So after the film got over, of course, I did not like it, so I asked him to fake punch me for a photo, which he did and was a good sport about it.

359
00:21:54,962 --> 00:21:59,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Where I saw the film was a small private screening room that Ebert and Roper and other media people used to view films.

360
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:04,569
[SPEAKER_06]: No major reporters were there, only smaller media outlets because of the status of the film.

361
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,351
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an amazing place and better than the film itself.

362
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:08,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoiler warning!

363
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:09,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I?

364
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:11,116
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's going to see it.

365
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:12,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no one's going to see it.

366
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:13,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to see it, but that's fine.

367
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:14,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

368
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:18,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Reduce the volume on your iPod for about 15 seconds if you don't want to hear the spoiler.

369
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:19,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.

370
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:26,245
[SPEAKER_06]: The only slightly funny part in this film where Yui will place himself as a stereotypical German dressed in lederhosen.

371
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:34,710
[SPEAKER_06]: In the film, he talks about how his films were funded by Nazi gold and then fights the creator of Postal because he was mad at Yui for ruining his game.

372
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:38,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I give credit to someone who can make fun of themselves, and I think he included the picture.

373
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to pull it up.

374
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:42,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we did.

375
00:22:44,912 --> 00:22:45,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

376
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:45,912
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

377
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:47,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

378
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:48,473
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

379
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:48,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Good picture.

380
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:49,434
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

381
00:22:49,554 --> 00:22:50,895
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a MySpace photo right there.

382
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:53,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I got punched in the face by UE Bowl.

383
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you should get that on a shirt.

384
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:58,178
[SPEAKER_02]: You should actually print that on a shirt and say, I got punched in the face by UE Bowl.

385
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,231
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

386
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki is Tingle or Uwe Bolle is not in the film industry anymore.

387
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:30,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have a better chance of getting him to leave the film industry than me to dress up as Tingle.

388
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:31,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, snap.

389
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:35,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Because at least signatures don't cost anything.

390
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,170
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

391
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:38,591
[SPEAKER_05]: True that.

392
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:41,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Last email.

393
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:42,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Last email.

394
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:43,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR.

395
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:47,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a loyal podcast listener and wanted to tell you how much I like your show.

396
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:47,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.

397
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:50,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Your show makes me happy and Loki's runs always make me laugh.

398
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,637
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, you guys make me laugh so much that I've gotten used to awkward stares in public.

399
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:57,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for making such a great show and please keep it up.

400
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,099
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is from Able2Think.

401
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,060
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more.

402
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:01,181
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

403
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:06,904
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I know how much you love Treasure, so I thought I'd let you know that the bleach fighting game on DS is made by them.

404
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,005
[SPEAKER_06]: P.P.S.

405
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:10,006
[SPEAKER_06]: An interesting question.

406
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:11,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to hear your answers.

407
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:40,085
[SPEAKER_06]: a woman while at the funeral of her mother met a man who she did not know she thought he was amazing she believed him to be her dream partner so much that she fell in love with him right then and there but never asked for his phone number or address and could not find him after the funeral a few days later she killed her sister so the question what was the woman's motive for killing her sister now think about it why would you think that she would kill her sister I don't know do I care

408
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:43,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Phil made her do it.

409
00:24:44,073 --> 00:24:45,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

410
00:24:46,196 --> 00:24:47,818
[SPEAKER_08]: So she can see the guy again?

411
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:49,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

412
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:50,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Answer.

413
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:53,605
[SPEAKER_06]: She was hoping the man would appear again at her sister's funeral.

414
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,228
[SPEAKER_06]: If you answer this correctly, you think like a psychopath.

415
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:57,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've heard that thing before.

416
00:24:58,014 --> 00:25:02,896
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a test used by a famous American psychologist to test if someone has the same mentality as a killer.

417
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:07,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Several incarcerated serial killers took part in the test and all answered the question correctly.

418
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,999
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't answer the question correctly, good for you.

419
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:13,181
[SPEAKER_06]: If you gave the correct answer, please let me know so I can keep an eye on you.

420
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're interviewing someone.

421
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:18,443
[SPEAKER_05]: So what was the motive?

422
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:19,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

423
00:25:19,683 --> 00:25:21,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they stabbed him in the face.

424
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:23,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you about my mother.

425
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:24,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Ba-dum-bum.

426
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:28,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you could just be good at logical deduction.

427
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:31,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you don't have to think like a psychopath.

428
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,318
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just think it out.

429
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,061
[SPEAKER_02]: That was last email, right?

430
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that was the last email.

431
00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:45,405
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, kids, we have a list list coming up tonight.

432
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:48,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

433
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:53,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I need everybody in studio to do a list of three things.

434
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:55,188
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's too many.

435
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,408
[SPEAKER_02]: We only can only do five.

436
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:57,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I figured that much.

437
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So Irene and Nathan, you guys can combine a list.

438
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:00,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So think a list of three things.

439
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

440
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody need cards to write things down?

441
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:05,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I built cards.

442
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:07,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like a card, Rob.

443
00:26:07,172 --> 00:26:07,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.

444
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:07,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a card.

445
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:08,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.

446
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:09,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

447
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a pen or a pencil?

448
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:14,236
[SPEAKER_02]: You can borrow mine, but you've got to give it to me.

449
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:14,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we have a pencil.

450
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:15,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.

451
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:16,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Never mind, but thank you very much, Rob.

452
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:17,879
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great radio, by the way.

453
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:18,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

454
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to fill time.

455
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the news, please.

456
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:21,441
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

457
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:26,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know I'm super excited this is finally launched, but guess what?

458
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:29,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Engage is back, bitches.

459
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:30,967
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

460
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,049
[SPEAKER_05]: The Engage application has finally launched.

461
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:45,453
[SPEAKER_05]: and it is compatible with Nokia's N81, N81 8GB, N82, N95, and N95 8GB phones.

462
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:49,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are five games right now currently available for it.

463
00:26:49,394 --> 00:26:56,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Brain Challenge, System Rush Evolution, and World Series of Poker and I guess two other ones.

464
00:26:56,515 --> 00:27:04,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all the other games, or all the games I guess offer free trials and then can be purchased straight from a computer.

465
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:05,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp

466
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:27,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it is the end gauge.

467
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:28,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick poll.

468
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:31,060
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a quick poll and chat right now.

469
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:34,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you guys to answer with yes or no.

470
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:38,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you care about the N-Gage?

471
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:39,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat room, answer now.

472
00:27:40,446 --> 00:27:40,606
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

473
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:41,427
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do this next story.

474
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:42,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you care about the N-Gage?

475
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:44,269
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the whole chat room.

476
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:44,930
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's see.

477
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Spoken on behalf of them.

478
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to see while I read this next story.

479
00:27:48,253 --> 00:27:49,754
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something people might care about.

480
00:27:50,014 --> 00:27:52,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Saints Row 2 is coming out on August 26th.

481
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:53,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you excited about this, Loki?

482
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:54,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.

483
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:56,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

484
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,383
[SPEAKER_02]: This was announced at the THQ Gamers Day, which was in San Francisco earlier this week.

485
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:01,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Which we didn't get invited to, those fuckers.

486
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:02,325
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we never do.

487
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:05,566
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a Saints Row 2 website now up and running.

488
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:09,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at saintsrow.com, not saintsrow2.com, but saintsrow.com.

489
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:16,690
[SPEAKER_02]: And the timing of it is between Grand Theft Auto 4 and Christmas, so it's a pretty good time.

490
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it, Saints Row 2.

491
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:21,523
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

492
00:28:36,678 --> 00:28:41,399
[SPEAKER_05]: with Uncle Gary talking about different aspects of the game that are new to Saints Row 2.

493
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:45,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, for those who aren't aware, Uncle Gary is Gary Busey.

494
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:46,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

495
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It is pretty funny.

496
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,821
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are some new things, especially if you've been reading any of the previews on there.

497
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:57,302
[SPEAKER_05]: There are sticky satchel charges that you can throw on people and detonate them remotely.

498
00:28:57,382 --> 00:28:59,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can actually throw people in this game.

499
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:02,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's different taunts you can do, including...

500
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:06,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe you can teabag someone in this game.

501
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.

502
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the results of our quick poll.

503
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you care about the end gauge?

504
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:11,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

505
00:29:12,171 --> 00:29:12,431
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

506
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:12,991
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

507
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:13,531
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

508
00:29:13,811 --> 00:29:14,051
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

509
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:14,571
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

510
00:29:14,831 --> 00:29:15,071
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

511
00:29:15,311 --> 00:29:15,551
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

512
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:16,511
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

513
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:17,332
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

514
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:17,852
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

515
00:29:18,112 --> 00:29:18,372
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

516
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:18,872
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

517
00:29:19,152 --> 00:29:19,372
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

518
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:20,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no.

519
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:20,692
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

520
00:29:20,952 --> 00:29:21,172
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

521
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,793
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

522
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:24,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Vader.

523
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:25,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

524
00:29:26,313 --> 00:29:26,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.

525
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:27,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

526
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:28,794
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

527
00:29:29,154 --> 00:29:29,454
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

528
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:30,454
[SPEAKER_02]: The what?

529
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:31,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's a no.

530
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:32,675
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

531
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:33,275
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

532
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:33,855
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

533
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:41,982
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolfClarifies is kinda saying, some of the games I saw for the new N-Gage platform had some neat ideas, so kinda.

534
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:49,286
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, Mayusatsuma says, the only N-Gage I care about was the one from Star Trek The Next Generation.

535
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,388
[SPEAKER_08]: No, God, why?

536
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:55,549
[SPEAKER_02]: You love that show, Jack.

537
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:57,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat comment of the night, I love it.

538
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,351
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite.

539
00:29:58,711 --> 00:29:59,051
[SPEAKER_02]: You win.

540
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:01,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it, the results of the quick poll.

541
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:02,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I answered the poll too.

542
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:04,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio is awesome.

543
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:06,254
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you say, DarkSakura?

544
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:07,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Padme, no.

545
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:08,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, look.

546
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:11,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Next story, please, DarkSakura.

547
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:14,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, okay.

548
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it would help if I actually could find it.

549
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:19,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there we go.

550
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:21,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Gran Turismo PSP.

551
00:30:22,642 --> 00:30:23,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

552
00:30:24,483 --> 00:30:25,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, some people do.

553
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:27,484
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually delayed until 2009.

554
00:30:27,544 --> 00:30:27,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

555
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:27,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

556
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:37,955
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be noted that it's actually called Duke Nukem Forever's Gran Turismo for the PSP.

557
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:44,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I call it, you know, you've got prologue, I guess.

558
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,117
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

559
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:52,959
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's funny, though, because they were showing this thing off like, I want to see before the PSP came out.

560
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:55,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it one of the things that they were saying, hey, yeah, it's going to be so awesome.

561
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I thought they were talking about Ridge Racer, though.

562
00:30:59,001 --> 00:30:59,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't happen.

563
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:06,120
[SPEAKER_05]: IGN It happens to the best of us.

564
00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:27,295
[SPEAKER_05]: IGN had a few things.

565
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:32,876
[SPEAKER_05]: First, their story about a game called Skate It coming out for the DS and the Wii.

566
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:38,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, that's a version of the game put out by EA that will be coming to the Nintendo platforms.

567
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:44,138
[SPEAKER_05]: No word on when exactly it will be coming out.

568
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:52,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the information was very brief, but they did say that they were talking about using, of course, the Wii Remote...

569
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:57,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what's better than spoiling one game?

570
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:20,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Spoiling two games because IGN did the same damn thing with an upcoming Batman game.

571
00:32:20,901 --> 00:32:22,242
[SPEAKER_02]: The story was pulled.

572
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:25,104
[SPEAKER_02]: There was not a lot of details on the game.

573
00:32:25,164 --> 00:32:29,787
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty much, I guess, just a generic kind of blank page that just indicated there was a Batman game coming.

574
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:35,290
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could probably put two and two together and figure that it was a...

575
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:38,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Knight Adaptation.

576
00:32:39,272 --> 00:32:44,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind, Pandemic is the company that made Destroy All Humans and Mercenaries.

577
00:32:44,934 --> 00:32:47,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pandemic was the company that was slated to make this Batman game.

578
00:32:48,055 --> 00:32:48,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think of that?

579
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,796
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks making Destroy All Humans making Batman.

580
00:32:51,696 --> 00:32:52,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be okay.

581
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:56,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Destroy All Humans has kind of been lost its edge since the first game.

582
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:58,739
[SPEAKER_05]: It's lost its edge.

583
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:01,399
[SPEAKER_05]: But Mercenaries 2 looks fucking awesome.

584
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a friend that worked on that.

585
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:11,535
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting though, here's what they had, actually someone had copied this from the NeoGAF forums.

586
00:33:12,436 --> 00:33:12,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It said,

587
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:29,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we know it's happening for sure.

588
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:37,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Elevation Partners, who were owners of Pandemic and Bioware until the EA purchase, had gained the video game rights to the franchise.

589
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:45,448
[SPEAKER_05]: We rumored last year that EA would publish the title, but now EA owns the aforementioned companies, and the publishing aspect was a given.

590
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:55,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, we don't have any specific platform, a release date, or even an official title, but given EA's history, we would expect a game to be called The Dark Knight, released this July alongside the film.

591
00:33:56,751 --> 00:34:11,190
[SPEAKER_05]: and to hit just about every platform known to humankind I can tell you right now it's probably not coming out in July I was going to say it seems a bit late but if they are developing something like that it could also come out around the release of the movie on DVD that's what I'm thinking more DVD Blu-ray time

592
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:11,690
[SPEAKER_05]: E.A.

593
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,012
[SPEAKER_05]: actually did the last Batman game, I think.

594
00:34:13,032 --> 00:34:13,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

595
00:34:13,212 --> 00:34:13,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

596
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it makes sense.

597
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:32,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the Batman games really kick ass.

598
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:35,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the old school Batman on the NES was one of the best games.

599
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:35,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was fun.

600
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,362
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the best games on the NES.

601
00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:38,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Heck yeah.

602
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:39,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Batman Returns was kind of wonky.

603
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:40,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play it.

604
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:42,565
[SPEAKER_02]: The first Batman was pretty awesome.

605
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:43,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

606
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:44,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

607
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:44,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Again.

608
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:48,428
[SPEAKER_02]: There are good movie adaptation games once in a great, great while.

609
00:34:48,748 --> 00:34:49,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, list list coming up.

610
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys have your list soon.

611
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,932
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming right up after one more story, which is Jamie's story.

612
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:56,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

613
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:05,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Samsung is bringing different games out for their smartphones and one of them is Second Life.

614
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:22,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically they're actually showing it the CTIA wireless thing that was going on where you can access it using the smartphones and talk through a text and SMS.

615
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:26,919
[SPEAKER_06]: So they said that they want to launch it in the second half of this year.

616
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:31,005
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.

617
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:35,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be interesting, though, if you can have that crack with you.

618
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,350
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Furry's Portable is what it is, right, Drew?

619
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:39,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Furry's Portable.

620
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:40,751
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

621
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:43,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's the deal, guys.

622
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:52,738
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to play a little game we have been playing since our first couple episodes here on Live365 right on down to the very last episode on Live365.

623
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:55,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a segment we call Listless.

624
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:05,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight's list list, the topic is things Live365 could do to get us to stay.

625
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:08,369
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a little while since we've done list lists, it's at least been a few months.

626
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:10,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our games only show up once every few months.

627
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:20,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the deal, the way it works is that we're going to go around the room and each person is going to name their top three, one at a time, things that Live365 could do to get us to stay.

628
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Has everybody done with their list?

629
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:27,081
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone is still in need of suggestions, chat room, you can try to influence us now.

630
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:33,708
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a good idea for things Life 365 could do to get us to stay, start posting those suggestions in chat now.

631
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:36,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe a host or a guest will pick up on it.

632
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:42,656
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, after the list is made, so we'll get a big list that has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 things on it.

633
00:36:42,957 --> 00:36:46,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to go around and we each take one thing off the list.

634
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,095
[SPEAKER_02]: We vote something off the list.

635
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:49,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's off the island, okay?

636
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:49,758
[SPEAKER_02]: No more.

637
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:57,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's off the list, and then the chat room will take that list of then 10 and vote on their favorite, and we will come up with the definitive list!

638
00:36:58,502 --> 00:37:00,724
[SPEAKER_02]: of things Life 365 could do to get us to stay.

639
00:37:01,064 --> 00:37:09,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Participating tonight, DarkSakura, myself, Loki, Drew, and so that we don't have too many people, Bryce Princess and Silent Nathan.

640
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:17,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be his new name, like Silent Bob, Silent Nathan, are going to be combined as one person because they're a couple and you can do that to couples.

641
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:18,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, that's so cute.

642
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:19,939
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of that, Silent Nathan?

643
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,641
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought.

644
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:23,041
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

645
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:25,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just giving him a hard time.

646
00:37:27,435 --> 00:37:28,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because his girlfriend hogs the mic.

647
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:29,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

648
00:37:30,357 --> 00:37:30,917
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean?

649
00:37:30,977 --> 00:37:31,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't hog the mic.

650
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:32,698
[SPEAKER_08]: You shut up now.

651
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here we go.

652
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start off the list.

653
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:39,562
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start tonight with Drew.

654
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:44,304
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your number three thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay?

655
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:45,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferret radio.

656
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:47,286
[SPEAKER_02]: All ferret, all the time.

657
00:37:49,995 --> 00:37:52,036
[SPEAKER_02]: AllFerret Radio, AllFerret all the time.

658
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:54,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I've ever fucking listened to that, but it might work.

659
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:55,918
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, AllFerret Radio.

660
00:37:56,698 --> 00:38:00,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess and Silent Nathan, your number three pick.

661
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:05,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Provide the studio, via Irene, a unicorn.

662
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,180
[SPEAKER_22]: Provide the studio a unicorn.

663
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:12,541
[SPEAKER_22]: Via Irene.

664
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,461
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, that's the important part of House of Beetle.

665
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:15,841
[SPEAKER_22]: I like that idea.

666
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:17,962
[SPEAKER_22]: I think a unicorn would be fun.

667
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:18,742
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be great.

668
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:20,022
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that would give me a stay.

669
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:22,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd stay with Life 365 if they gave me a unicorn.

670
00:38:23,683 --> 00:38:24,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And leave like six months later.

671
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you have the unicorn.

672
00:38:27,503 --> 00:38:28,604
[SPEAKER_22]: Do I have to feed it?

673
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:30,124
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope they provide food, too.

674
00:38:30,164 --> 00:38:32,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure unicorns are self-sufficient.

675
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Unicorns eat children.

676
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:35,545
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, see?

677
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:38,070
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got millions of them here.

678
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,710
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

679
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,371
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see what happens.

680
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:43,713
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just curious what Bobby Blackwolf thinks of this whole segment.

681
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:49,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing if he suggested anything because, you know, it could change.

682
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,537
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have to pull out of the deal.

683
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:56,640
[SPEAKER_02]: If Live365 is able to provide a unicorn, we might have to pull out.

684
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see what some of the other things are on the list.

685
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:00,662
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, we'll go to you next.

686
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:02,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three, your number three pick.

687
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:04,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Pay for me to relocate to England.

688
00:39:07,168 --> 00:39:07,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Just you?

689
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:09,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

690
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:11,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, me and the people of my choice.

691
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:20,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sorry, I'm slow.

692
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:24,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm typing as we do this here, so it takes me a minute.

693
00:39:27,176 --> 00:39:27,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, filler.

694
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

695
00:39:29,197 --> 00:39:29,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Irene, sing.

696
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:32,138
[SPEAKER_02]: When we need a little filler, you're going to sing, okay?

697
00:39:32,178 --> 00:39:33,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I can dance, I can sing.

698
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why we have the theme music, too, so there's something to listen to.

699
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your number three pick.

700
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:40,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like Ken Kutaragi's heart on a platter.

701
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:42,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Kalima!

702
00:39:43,063 --> 00:39:44,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Kalima!

703
00:39:46,704 --> 00:39:47,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, we can't do that.

704
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:48,405
[SPEAKER_04]: We're out of platters.

705
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:49,065
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sick.

706
00:39:49,825 --> 00:39:50,466
[SPEAKER_02]: You're sick.

707
00:39:51,846 --> 00:39:53,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you got that serial killer question right.

708
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:56,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken Kutaragi's heart on a platter.

709
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:57,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

710
00:39:57,867 --> 00:39:58,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Lawsuit in the air.

711
00:39:58,827 --> 00:39:59,348
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

712
00:39:59,368 --> 00:40:00,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Sue Live 365.

713
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:00,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't sue us.

714
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:01,370
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

715
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, he's joking.

716
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:04,793
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

717
00:40:05,593 --> 00:40:06,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously.

718
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:11,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love what the chat room suggests.

719
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:15,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read that later after what we get here.

720
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:15,542
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

721
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:17,303
[SPEAKER_02]: My number three thing.

722
00:40:17,383 --> 00:40:17,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

723
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:20,266
[SPEAKER_02]: The number three thing Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

724
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:24,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Force Compile to reform and make a sequel to The Guardian Legend.

725
00:40:25,076 --> 00:40:25,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes!

726
00:40:27,478 --> 00:40:27,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Dot com.

727
00:40:32,743 --> 00:40:37,647
[SPEAKER_02]: If Live 365 wants us to stay, they will force compile to get back together and make a sequel to The Guardian Legend.

728
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:38,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

729
00:40:38,387 --> 00:40:41,290
[SPEAKER_02]: At gunpoint, however they have to do it, but that's the only way we're staying.

730
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,030
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

731
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:43,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

732
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:44,572
[SPEAKER_02]: The number two way...

733
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:51,857
[SPEAKER_20]: Make tuner software that doesn't suck.

734
00:40:52,477 --> 00:40:54,678
[SPEAKER_20]: Make tuner software that doesn't suck.

735
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:56,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Radio 365, I'm looking at you.

736
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:03,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think that I was using the SAM2 broadcaster?

737
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:05,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, nice.

738
00:41:07,142 --> 00:41:14,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Irene and Silent Nathan, what is the number three, I'm sorry, number two thing that Live365 could do to get us to stay?

739
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:16,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Blowjobs for everyone.

740
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:22,232
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my number one answer.

741
00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:24,953
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one was blow me.

742
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:28,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to have to change that, you asshole.

743
00:41:29,034 --> 00:41:31,035
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, I'm stealing a great one from chat.

744
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:32,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's see.

745
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:35,537
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you're number two.

746
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:36,717
[SPEAKER_06]: My number two?

747
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:39,898
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be to pay me $100,000 a year to do Orange Lounge Radio.

748
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:49,650
[SPEAKER_06]: by me I mean us each and guests get like $5,000 a visit they get royalties

749
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that kind of is the same thing as what she said.

750
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a reference?

751
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here's mine, here's mine.

752

[SPEAKER_05]: Pay us $200,000 a year to do Orsandria.

753
00:42:20,981 --> 00:42:23,782
[SPEAKER_06]: That was actually my original number three.

754
00:42:24,602 --> 00:42:25,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm serious.

755
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:25,842

[SPEAKER_02]: Heal my pancreas.

760
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:42,029
[SPEAKER_02]: They could do that with a unicorn.

[SPEAKER_06]: We need to play you the Weird Al song over and over and over again until your pancreas go, okay, fine!

762
00:42:49,216 --> 00:42:53,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Heal my pancreas, the number two thing that Light365 could do to get us to stay.

763
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:58,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, yeah, DarkSakura, heal please.

764
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:01,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Give Jamie a cookie.

765
00:43:01,082 --> 00:43:02,103
[SPEAKER_02]: How about give Jamie pastrami?

766
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:19,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I like pastrami better.

767
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:20,207
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

768
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:22,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, give Jamie a pastrami cookie.

00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:25,289
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

770
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess and Silent Nathan, did you come to a consensus?

771
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:31,872
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your number one thing that Life is Survived could do to get you to stay?

772
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,173
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a complete consensus between me and Irene.

773
00:43:35,273 --> 00:43:35,573
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

774
00:43:36,374 --> 00:43:41,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back in time and make Rob not retarded so that he'll vote for Chrono Trigger.

775
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:41,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

776
00:43:44,915 --> 00:44:10,318
[SPEAKER_02]: referencing tonight's bonus segment we were talking about OLR March Madness just so the podcast listeners know I cast the deciding vote between Super Metroid and Chrono Trigger so alright I have to shorten that though for the sake of pencil space to put make Rob vote for Chrono Trigger no you don't you can type that all out Rob you leave that intact Mr. Rob hold on you better sing

777
00:44:13,263 --> 00:44:15,665
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your number one thing on the list.

778
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a damn thing.

779
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:20,110
[SPEAKER_07]: They done fucked up.

780
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:20,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Good answer.

781
00:44:35,984 --> 00:44:37,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's our winner right there.

782
00:44:37,165 --> 00:44:38,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a damn thing they've done.

783
00:44:38,805 --> 00:44:41,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Bucked up is DarkSakura's number one answer.

784
00:44:41,987 --> 00:44:43,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your number one answer.

785
00:44:44,068 --> 00:44:47,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to go with George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine.

786
00:44:50,051 --> 00:44:52,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you mean the PS3?

787
00:44:52,332 --> 00:44:59,416
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't my choice, and I'm sure this is for the chairman, because I sure as hell wouldn't want to see this happen, but purchase one million copies of The Eye of Judgment.

788
00:45:04,588 --> 00:45:06,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody check this man for a fever.

789
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,091
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it, that's the one I was going to steal, you ass.

790
00:45:10,512 --> 00:45:12,253
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, then put in George Foreign Folk.

791
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,253
[SPEAKER_02]: No, grilling machine.

792
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:14,434
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's too late.

793
00:45:14,474 --> 00:45:18,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You said purchase one million copies of Eye of Judgment is Loki's number one.

794
00:45:18,937 --> 00:45:23,440
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so if Life is Five purchases one million copies of Eye of Judgment, then we'll stay.

795
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll have much LOL with it.

796
00:45:26,722 --> 00:45:27,782
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, my number one.

797
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:31,845
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one would be the thing that Life is Five could do to get us to stay...

798
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy us a George Foreman full cow grilling machine There you go

799
00:45:47,654 --> 00:45:52,240
[SPEAKER_02]: If you might remember from the... I think the last time we did this was for the Consumer Electronics Show.

800
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Things we most want to see at Consumer Electronics Show.

801
00:45:55,124 --> 00:46:03,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the answers was, buy us a George Foreman... I'm sorry, the answer was, a George Foreman full cow grilling machine that actually grills the entire cow.

802
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:26,307
[SPEAKER_02]: All Ferret Radio, Provide a Unicorn via Irene, Pay for DarkSakura and the people of her choice to go to England, Ken Kutaragi's Heart on a Platter, Force a sequel to The Guardian Legend, Make tuner software that doesn't suck,

805
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:44,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a damn thing.

00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:45,672
[SPEAKER_02]: They done fucked up.

807
00:46:46,152 --> 00:46:51,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Purchase one million copies of Eye of Judgment and buy us a George Foreman full cow grilling machine.

808
00:46:51,779 --> 00:46:52,960
[SPEAKER_22]: Damn it, this is hard.

809
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,522
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good list.

810
00:46:54,722 --> 00:46:58,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this would be kind of a dumb segment tonight, but we did a good job.

811
00:46:58,646 --> 00:46:59,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really have to remove...

812
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:02,529
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the game, sorry to say.

813
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to start with the same order.

814
00:47:04,871 --> 00:47:05,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew Nami, we'll start with you.

815
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:08,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one of these items is not worthy of the list?

816
00:47:09,233 --> 00:47:10,734
[SPEAKER_02]: The $100,000 a year.

817
00:47:10,934 --> 00:47:11,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew someone had to do that.

818
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:15,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay $100,000 a year to do OLR is off the list.

819
00:47:15,757 --> 00:47:20,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Rice Princess and Silent Nathan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

820
00:47:21,761 --> 00:47:23,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay $200,000 a year.

821
00:47:25,163 --> 00:47:27,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, throw the baby out with a bathwater.

822
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,545
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you not like money or something?

823
00:47:28,565 --> 00:47:28,605
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

824
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I put it in there that it's paying $5,000 each minute.

825
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:38,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Nathan's more interested in blowjobs for everyone, alright?

826
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, who's next?

827
00:47:40,712 --> 00:47:43,135
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

828
00:47:43,296 --> 00:47:44,277
[SPEAKER_06]: All ferret radio.

829
00:47:44,677 --> 00:47:45,939
[SPEAKER_02]: All ferret radio.

830
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:47,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we have that anyway.

831
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:52,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

832
00:47:52,692 --> 00:47:56,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is going to sound weird, but blowjobs for everyone, because who knows who's giving those blowjobs?

833
00:47:56,553 --> 00:47:58,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that could be some scary shit.

834
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:01,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, have you ever watched Cat House Girls?

835
00:48:01,614 --> 00:48:01,834
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

836
00:48:02,894 --> 00:48:04,075
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be some scary stuff.

837
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,556
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be Air Force Amy.

838
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:08,376
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

839
00:48:08,436 --> 00:48:08,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

840
00:48:10,124 --> 00:48:26,871
[SPEAKER_02]: My turn, we have Provide a Unicorn, Pay for DarkSakura to go to England, Ken Kudaragi's Heart on a Platter, Force a Sequel of Guardian Legend, Make Tuner Software Doesn't Suck, Heal Rob's Pancreas, Give Jamie a Cookie, Go Back in Time, Make Me Vote for Chrono Trigger, Not a Damn Thing, Purchase 1,000,000 Copies of I, Judgment, and Buy Us George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine.

841
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:31,753
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I deem not worthy of the list, Ken Kudaragi's Heart on a Platter.

842
00:48:31,773 --> 00:48:33,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's kind of sick.

843
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:34,014
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

844
00:48:35,255 --> 00:48:35,595
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

845
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:40,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is the list that you in chat can vote for.

846
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:47,058
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to send me, Sky, a private message in chat with your top two in order.

847
00:48:47,298 --> 00:48:51,080
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important because your first pick actually gets two votes, okay?

848
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is the list as it stands.

849
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:57,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to paste a big thing in chat, so brace yourselves.

850
00:48:57,922 --> 00:48:58,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

851
00:49:00,363 --> 00:49:01,484
[SPEAKER_06]: As Rob gets kicked from chat.

852
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:02,224
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I won't get kicked.

853
00:49:03,156 --> 00:49:03,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go.

854
00:49:03,896 --> 00:49:05,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is the list as it stands.

855
00:49:05,077 --> 00:49:09,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that doesn't win because that's kind of easy.

856
00:49:22,023 --> 00:49:23,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it win, people!

857
00:49:46,124 --> 00:49:48,165
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

858
00:50:12,535 --> 00:50:17,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even realize that came out this week, but that was one of the days I was in the hospital, so I must have missed it.

859
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:38,690
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you get all the Mr. Peabody and stuff, too?

860
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. Peabody, Sherman, they're all in there.

861
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:41,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

862
00:50:42,031 --> 00:50:46,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to tell you a bit of trivia, though, about the Data East machine.

863
00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:53,053
[SPEAKER_06]: The picture of the Wayback Machine, right next to it is the DeLorean from Back to the Future on the playfield.

864
00:50:53,914 --> 00:50:54,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

865
00:50:55,414 --> 00:50:55,714
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

866
00:50:57,045 --> 00:50:58,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to check that out.

867
00:50:58,085 --> 00:50:59,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize that had come out.

868
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:02,027
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have Pinball FX and I would like some more tables for it.

869
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:03,187
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm definitely going to check that out.

870
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:06,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad we do this show because I missed a lot of gaming news while I was out.

871
00:51:07,288 --> 00:51:08,468
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on with the gaming news.

872
00:51:08,488 --> 00:51:09,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to start tallying some votes.

873
00:51:11,049 --> 00:51:12,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that would be my turn, wouldn't it?

874
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

875
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:21,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there is talk about a game called Velociraptor Safari coming out to the iPhone.

876
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:23,273
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

877
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:32,564
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I appreciate iPhone gaming, you know, and what they're doing with it, I don't think I would find it in my heart to play Velociraptor Safari.

878
00:51:32,624 --> 00:51:33,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that shit.

879
00:51:33,225 --> 00:51:34,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring us Jumbo Safari.

880
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:38,367
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't played Velociraptor Safari, then it's fun.

881
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:38,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

882
00:51:39,548 --> 00:51:40,168
[SPEAKER_06]: How fun is it?

883
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you get to kill them?

884
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:43,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you have a giant spiky chain.

885
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I will kill Velociraptor.

886
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:49,893
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a spiky chain that you catch the Velociraptor with and you have to pull him through a portal type thing.

887
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:51,794
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like Jumbo Safari.

888
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:53,670
[SPEAKER_06]: with Velociraptors.

889
00:51:53,991 --> 00:52:01,939
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a web game, of course, and what they did is made the client compatible with the iPhones.

890
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,862
[SPEAKER_05]: No cost to you, which is awesome.

891
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:07,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe I'll have to give it a go.

892
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:08,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

893
00:52:09,547 --> 00:52:09,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

894
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:13,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm too busy listening to American Idol on YouTube.

895
00:52:15,356 --> 00:52:20,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are some new developments now in the world of PS3 piracy.

896
00:52:21,862 --> 00:52:26,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, there is now a PS3 backup launcher.

897
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:31,592
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is, though, it's still in alpha, and it only works on PS3 dev stations.

898
00:52:32,132 --> 00:52:39,840
[SPEAKER_05]: But what it allows you to do is boot PS3 games from the hard drive, boot games from a DVD or Blu-ray disc drive,

899
00:52:40,856 --> 00:52:49,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Copy original PS3 games from said optical drive to the hard drive and patch executables on some games to run from the hard drive.

900
00:52:49,964 --> 00:52:52,065
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

901
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:58,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a matter of time, I guess, before this becomes as vulnerable as, say, the PSP, which isn't good.

902
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:05,536
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can imagine, though, that a lot of people probably wouldn't want to copy a 50 gig game to their hard drive.

903
00:53:06,196 --> 00:53:07,017
[SPEAKER_05]: That would probably suck.

904
00:53:08,258 --> 00:53:08,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

905
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:10,761
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

906
00:53:11,742 --> 00:53:13,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm in the middle of tallying votes.

907
00:53:13,383 --> 00:53:15,045
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of votes tonight, by the way.

908
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:19,589
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to vote, this is your last chance to vote in tonight's listless.

909
00:53:20,509 --> 00:53:22,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

910
00:53:23,812 --> 00:53:27,516
[SPEAKER_02]: One more story before we get to some last-minute stories.

911
00:53:28,183 --> 00:53:36,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured this would be an appropriate story since OLR is always dedicated to giving you the current in gaming news and staying on top of what's going on in the scene.

912
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:40,111
[SPEAKER_02]: There are new prototypes for the Atari 7800.

913
00:53:41,311 --> 00:53:41,852
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

914
00:53:43,113 --> 00:53:46,695
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually download them, the ROMs, you can get them at AtariAge.com.

915
00:53:47,335 --> 00:53:48,956
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a game called Sirius.

916
00:53:49,076 --> 00:53:52,739
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a side-scrolling shooter that's kind of like R-Type and Gradius.

917
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:53,939
[SPEAKER_02]: For the 7800, it's not bad.

918
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:57,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Plutos is a vertically scrolling shooter.

919
00:53:57,743 --> 00:54:03,505
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not quite as ambitious as Sirius, according to the poster at LostLevels.org where this is found, but it's still not bad.

920
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:12,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rampart, which apparently is some type of port of the arcade game that I quite enjoyed Rampart back when... Yeah, remember that game?

921
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:14,149
[SPEAKER_02]: They ported it to a lot of systems.

922
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:17,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there was a prototype for the 7800 that never quite got off the ground.

923
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:19,511
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

924
00:54:19,571 --> 00:54:21,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have a couple 5200 prototypes.

925
00:54:23,156 --> 00:54:24,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual cartridges or just ROMs?

926
00:54:24,557 --> 00:54:27,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the remakes like that that they did.

927
00:54:27,779 --> 00:54:28,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a couple of them.

928
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wanted to pick up one of those flashback consoles.

929
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:32,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're kind of fun.

930
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:33,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I might still pick one up.

931
00:54:34,183 --> 00:54:35,925
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't have Activision games in there, do they?

932
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:39,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get made fun of by Irene for this, but I don't care.

933
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:41,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they have an Activision one.

934
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:45,451
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite Atari 2600 game of all time, well, there's two.

935
00:54:45,671 --> 00:54:48,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Pitfall 2 is the first, but the other one is Kaboom.

936
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:50,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would I make fun of you?

937
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:51,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you make fun of me for everything.

938
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask Orange Lounge Ask Orange Lounge

939
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:13,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray!

940
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:25,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody, for some reason, I don't know why, but there's a picture on Xbox 360 Fanboy of a Master Chief My Little Pony that someone made, and it's kind of weird looking.

941
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,169
[SPEAKER_08]: That creeps me out.

942
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,290
[SPEAKER_05]: It gives me nightmares.

943
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:31,010
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very creepy.

944
00:55:31,631 --> 00:55:36,293
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also some videos on Xbox 360 Fanboy of the new download content for...

945
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:44,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Burnout Paradise, actually, and that's also available on the developer's website, CriterionGames.com.

946
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,363
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a thing on there for that.

947
00:55:47,383 --> 00:55:49,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

948
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:55,126
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also, this was another one of the April Fool's jokes that was out there.

949
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:59,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Super PP Brothers, it was from ThinkGeek.com.

950
00:56:00,328 --> 00:56:07,631
[SPEAKER_05]: They did, like, the thing that would, the Wii remote would kind of fit into this, almost like a jockstrap or, like, panty thing that you would put on and

951
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,790
[SPEAKER_05]: GameRadar.com

952
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:39,457
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

953
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:00,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Mario 3.

954
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:05,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they also have Paper Bowser World, Paper Bowser World, Operation Grom.

955
00:57:06,294 --> 00:57:10,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are two full games that are done kind of similar to Super Paper Mario.

956
00:57:11,175 --> 00:57:18,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Neo Sonic Universe, which looks kind of cool, kind of a brand new side-scrolling Sonic game.

957
00:57:19,116 --> 00:57:26,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the Metroid 2 remake, which now has a playable demo work-in-progress demo

958
00:57:28,197 --> 00:57:56,185
[SPEAKER_05]: and then finally Chrono Resurrection which of course you may remember got cancelled it was the full 3D remake of Chrono Trigger and I think which should be added to the list they have that new Mario game that someone was making that was a mashup of Halo, Mega Man and all that stuff that should probably be added to the list but if you go check out the article which is on Dig right now and it's also on GamesRadar.com they have links to most of the games that you can download of course not Chrono Resurrection because

959
00:57:57,202 --> 00:57:58,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Only the devs get to play that one.

960
00:58:02,848 --> 00:58:04,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got to import this game.

961
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:06,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Momo World War 2.

962
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:12,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like chicks in, Nazi chicks in bikinis or something done anime style.

963
00:58:12,858 --> 00:58:14,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

964
00:58:14,499 --> 00:58:16,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Sexy Nazi anime girl game.

965
00:58:17,102 --> 00:58:18,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, that sounds pretty awesome.

966
00:58:19,885 --> 00:58:20,205
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

967
00:58:22,329 --> 00:58:25,590
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, ready to figure out who won tonight's listless segment?

968
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:26,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

969
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:28,751
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's reveal the winners tonight.

970
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:35,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Things Live3CC5 could do to get us to stay the definitive list.

971
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:40,134
[SPEAKER_02]: As voted by you, the chatters created by us, the hosts and guests.

972
00:58:40,574 --> 00:58:45,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is, the number three thing that Live3CC5 could do to get us to stay.

973
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide us a unicorn via Irene.

974
00:58:49,766 --> 00:58:50,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three?

975
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:52,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Unicorns can do anything.

976
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:53,789
[SPEAKER_08]: That should have been number one.

977
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:56,592
[SPEAKER_08]: It would have made all the other dreams come true, but I won't mope.

978
00:58:57,112 --> 00:58:57,412
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

979
00:58:57,452 --> 00:58:57,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay.

980
00:58:58,113 --> 00:59:00,455
[SPEAKER_02]: At number two, we have a tie.

981
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,156
[SPEAKER_02]: At number two, we have a tie.

982
00:59:03,017 --> 00:59:08,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, buy us a George Foreman full cow grilling machine is more important than the unicorn.

983
00:59:08,862 --> 00:59:11,044
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a George Foreman unicorn grilling machine?

984
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:11,785
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

985
00:59:11,805 --> 00:59:11,845
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

986
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:15,572
[SPEAKER_02]: and Not A Damn Thing.

987
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:16,812
[SPEAKER_02]: They done fucked up.

988
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:19,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I was number two.

989
00:59:19,353 --> 00:59:20,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I was number two.

990
00:59:20,073 --> 00:59:20,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised too.

991
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:24,355
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I looked at what was number one and I wasn't surprised at all.

992
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:27,536
[SPEAKER_02]: The number one thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay?

993
00:59:28,656 --> 00:59:31,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Purchase one million copies of The Eye of Judgment.

994
00:59:32,977 --> 00:59:33,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Big surprise.

995
00:59:33,818 --> 00:59:35,238
[SPEAKER_20]: And settle this bet once and for all.

996
00:59:35,258 --> 00:59:38,079
[SPEAKER_20]: You do realize, of course, that Jamie does not get a cookie now.

997
00:59:39,213 --> 00:59:40,474
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay, I can't have a cookie.

998
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:41,074
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what?

999
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:43,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, um, let's see.

1000
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:46,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Heal Rob's pancreas would have been fourth, and then give Jamie a cookie would have been fifth.

1001
00:59:47,558 --> 00:59:48,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want a cookie.

1002
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:48,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1003
00:59:49,739 --> 00:59:50,260
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1004
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,323
[SPEAKER_06]: When I come up here to do this show the day after my birthday, I want banana pudding.

1005
00:59:56,783 --> 00:59:58,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it nice to want... Or carrot cake.

1006
01:00:01,786 --> 01:00:02,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are my demands.

1007
01:00:05,555 --> 01:00:06,836
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1008
01:00:35,951 --> 01:00:36,471
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Rob's...

1009
01:01:05,783 --> 01:01:07,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, what would you like to say?

1010
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:14,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to say that I am very sick because my pancreas hurts.

1011
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:17,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, it's Extifer.

1012
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,233
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going?

1013
01:01:18,253 --> 01:01:19,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Extifer?

1014
01:01:20,034 --> 01:01:22,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine, even though you're an asshole.

1015
01:01:23,817 --> 01:01:25,018
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's up, Extifer?

1016
01:01:25,779 --> 01:01:31,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm doing pretty well, and you?

1017
01:01:32,764 --> 01:01:35,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my pancreas hurts a little bit, yeah.

1018
01:01:36,563 --> 01:01:37,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw.

1019
01:01:37,604 --> 01:01:38,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

1020
01:01:38,924 --> 01:01:42,306
[SPEAKER_09]: You should stop letting Irene punch you in the pancreas.

1021
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:43,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do that, actually.

1022
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,047
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's never going to happen.

1023
01:01:45,808 --> 01:01:58,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Extifer, you used to do a show here on our station, our little network here on Live3CC5, and we already canceled your show once, and now we're leaving from Live3CC5 altogether.

1024
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make you sad?

1025
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:04,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, actually.

1026
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:05,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

1027
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:19,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really, you know, sad when I couldn't do the show anymore because I live in another city now and it's hard, you know, for me to get over there to do any type of programming anyway.

1028
01:02:19,533 --> 01:02:25,136
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, we kind of ended, I mean, at least with me, it kind of ended a long time ago.

1029
01:02:25,217 --> 01:02:31,100
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, it does make me sad that we don't have the opportunity to do it again, I guess.

1030
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:34,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it kind of sucks.

1031
01:02:34,102 --> 01:02:34,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless they're...

1032
01:02:35,353 --> 01:02:42,435
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of tonight's list list, though, with the ways that Live 365 could get us to stay?

1033
01:02:42,495 --> 01:02:44,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you agree, or is there something else that you would have put on the list?

1034
01:02:48,757 --> 01:02:51,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm all for the cow and the George Farman grill.

1035
01:02:52,839 --> 01:02:53,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good, huh?

1036
01:02:53,779 --> 01:02:58,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually... I'm like, you know, get me a cow, put it on the grill.

1037
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I am like, you know, meat central.

1038
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:03,602
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I can think about.

1039
01:03:04,695 --> 01:03:06,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he just say, I am Meat Central?

1040
01:03:06,676 --> 01:03:07,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he did.

1041
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:08,057
[SPEAKER_02]: He did.

1042
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:09,417
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, I am Meat Central.

1043
01:03:09,437 --> 01:03:10,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I am Meat Central.

1044
01:03:11,798 --> 01:03:13,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Is my connection breaking up?

1045
01:03:13,339 --> 01:03:15,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I feel like the connection's breaking up.

1046
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,360
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just a little laggy, but that's okay.

1047
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wrap up because we want to get to some real calls.

1048
01:03:20,462 --> 01:03:21,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

1049
01:03:21,302 --> 01:03:21,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, snap.

1050
01:03:22,543 --> 01:03:23,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a fake call.

1051
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:27,765
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to ask you real quickly, do you have any parting words?

1052
01:03:27,785 --> 01:03:32,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not that we won't ever have you on all games, our new home, but do you have any parting words for Live365?

1053
01:03:36,264 --> 01:03:41,089
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm about ready to go bleach my asshole, so that's it.

1054
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:42,490
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1055
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:44,031
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, have a good one.

1056
01:03:45,233 --> 01:03:46,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, Extifer.

1057
01:03:46,053 --> 01:03:47,695
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, have a good synchronous.

1058
01:03:48,255 --> 01:03:49,316
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you too.

1059
01:03:49,376 --> 01:03:49,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1060
01:03:50,563 --> 01:03:54,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye Christopher, I mean, Xtofer, we love you.

1061
01:03:56,245 --> 01:03:57,105
[SPEAKER_08]: And your asshole.

1062
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,526
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we should have put on the list.

1063
01:03:58,586 --> 01:04:03,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Live 365 has to bleach Xtofer's asshole.

1064
01:04:03,827 --> 01:04:04,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god.

1065
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:05,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, no.

1066
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:06,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew.

1067
01:04:06,908 --> 01:04:07,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1068
01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:08,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Bleach.

1069
01:04:08,649 --> 01:04:09,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1070
01:04:09,562 --> 01:04:11,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the deal for tonight's Skype line.

1071
01:04:11,703 --> 01:04:14,864
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to open it up, but with some boundaries tonight.

1072
01:04:15,264 --> 01:04:20,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, you can state your name, and you get to ask us a question.

1073
01:04:20,406 --> 01:04:27,709
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you try to do anything else, like you start ranting about Jack Voldemort or whatever, then you're getting cut off.

1074
01:04:27,889 --> 01:04:34,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Because tonight, we want to bring back for one last time on Live 365, Ask Orange Lounge.

1075
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,032
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready, Jamie?

1076
01:04:35,192 --> 01:04:35,753
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for you.

1077
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:42,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of the Doctor

1078
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,781
[SPEAKER_02]: State your question, Legend of Zaku.

1079
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:20,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, basically, I know it's been like five and a half years and everything, but do you have any regrets?

1080
01:05:21,365 --> 01:05:25,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Any regrets at all of the journey you've taken so far?

1081
01:05:27,388 --> 01:05:28,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start with DarkSakura.

1082
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:29,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies first.

1083
01:05:30,189 --> 01:05:32,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I regret letting Andrew tell jokes.

1084
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:34,512
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki?

1085
01:05:34,652 --> 01:05:35,432
[SPEAKER_20]: I regret it too.

1086
01:05:36,413 --> 01:05:38,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I regret ever doing an impression of Tingle's voice.

1087
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:40,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Laughter

1088
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:46,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised you didn't say I regret ever buying karaoke revolution.

1089
01:05:47,171 --> 01:05:47,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Too late.

1090
01:05:48,192 --> 01:05:49,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess, Drew, anything?

1091
01:05:49,932 --> 01:05:50,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I regret nothing.

1092
01:05:51,192 --> 01:05:54,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's really freaking loud.

1093
01:05:54,933 --> 01:05:55,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew?

1094
01:05:56,074 --> 01:06:00,135
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say I regret... That's more than the question.

1095
01:06:03,475 --> 01:06:03,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearts.

1096
01:06:04,636 --> 01:06:05,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, though.

1097
01:06:05,576 --> 01:06:09,357
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I regret, I'm going to be honest, not doing this sooner.

1098
01:06:10,325 --> 01:06:11,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, caller, state your name A lone vacationer

1099
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:38,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, LoneVacationer.

1100
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:40,262
[SPEAKER_02]: State your question, please.

1101
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:51,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Rob, I was wondering why you had to be so retarded for Metroid instead of Chrono Trigger.

1102
01:06:53,393 --> 01:06:58,256
[SPEAKER_02]: The sad thing is the podcast listeners aren't going to get this because they didn't hear the bonus segment tonight.

1103
01:06:58,857 --> 01:07:04,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I voted for Super Metroid because I believe it to be the greatest video game of all time.

1104
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:09,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, as much as I love Chrono Trigger, I loved the Final Fantasy series just a little bit more.

1105
01:07:10,004 --> 01:07:11,925
[SPEAKER_02]: The battles got annoying to me in Chrono Trigger.

1106
01:07:11,965 --> 01:07:13,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it was, but it did have a good story.

1107
01:07:14,106 --> 01:07:24,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect Chrono Trigger as a game, but as far as Super Metroid, it was the music, it was the fact that it was a game that you could sit down and beat in one sitting, but it felt like there was so much you could do.

1108
01:07:25,015 --> 01:07:32,921
[SPEAKER_02]: You could play it where you collect everything, you could play it where you explore everything, you could play it to speed beat it, and all of those things were accessible to a normal person.

1109
01:07:33,301 --> 01:07:41,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it takes a hobbyist to speed play through a game and stuff, but just with the items and everything, it's just a game I remember very much in my memory.

1110
01:07:42,648 --> 01:07:43,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you have it.

1111
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,522
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the caller knew not to say anything else because that would be more than a question.

1112
01:07:49,942 --> 01:07:54,705
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1113
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1114
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:58,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask Orange Lounge.

1115
01:07:58,067 --> 01:07:58,667
[SPEAKER_02]: State your name.

1116
01:07:59,587 --> 01:08:00,668
[SPEAKER_02]: The name is Ranma.

1117
01:08:00,948 --> 01:08:03,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Ranma, and please state your question.

1118
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:10,273
[SPEAKER_16]: My question is to everyone, your greatest or favorite moment on Live365?

1119
01:08:12,492 --> 01:08:14,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit, this is going to be a hard one.

1120
01:08:14,433 --> 01:08:17,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, there's so much.

1121
01:08:18,975 --> 01:08:24,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can't say it though because that would be more than a question, but you could private message it to me in chat and I might read it.

1122
01:08:25,277 --> 01:08:28,598
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what was your favorite moment in all of Life 365's history?

1123
01:08:30,179 --> 01:08:30,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Leaving it.

1124
01:08:33,059 --> 01:08:34,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Episode 69, The Whole Thing

1125
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:00,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing.

1126
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:00,380
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1127
01:09:29,099 --> 01:09:30,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I delete it on accident?

1128
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, I did not.

1129
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Rob, how could you?

1130
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you did.

1131
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:35,261
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be terrible.

1132
01:09:36,022 --> 01:09:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, briefly explain for the listeners what that was about, Loki.

1133
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:40,103
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

1134
01:09:40,123 --> 01:09:45,245
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got nominated for most unlikely to hear on, like, terrestrial radio.

1135
01:09:45,285 --> 01:09:46,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, let me see if this is it.

1136
01:09:49,367 --> 01:09:50,347
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's something else.

1137
01:09:50,647 --> 01:09:52,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I have a Kylie Minogue song in there?

1138
01:09:53,128 --> 01:09:53,829
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I'm gay.

1139
01:09:54,249 --> 01:09:54,589
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1140
01:09:56,169 --> 01:09:57,730
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1141
01:10:20,106 --> 01:10:21,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Brokaw on the West Coast, Fixing the Word Bukkake

1142
01:10:47,814 --> 01:10:53,220
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually a clip from Howard Stern, but it was so funny here on the show when they played it.

1143
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,601
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not right.

1144
01:11:07,621 --> 01:11:08,241
[SPEAKER_13]: That ain't right.

1145
01:11:08,281 --> 01:11:10,542
[SPEAKER_13]: People on the West Coast got gypped of hearing Bukkake.

1146
01:11:10,702 --> 01:11:18,625
[SPEAKER_13]: And in this report out of Moscow tonight, two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously today.

1147
01:11:19,225 --> 01:11:25,688
[SPEAKER_13]: The first crash happened in Bukkake, about 110 miles south of Moscow.

1148
01:11:26,388 --> 01:11:27,408
[SPEAKER_08]: He said Bukkake.

1149
01:11:27,509 --> 01:11:35,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That clip was courtesy of the Howard Stern Show, but that Bukkake thing, I swear to God, gave us like a month worth of stuff.

1150
01:11:37,383 --> 01:11:38,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming Radio, So Uncensored,

1151
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:10,352
[SPEAKER_21]: and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1152
01:12:12,254 --> 01:12:14,175
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1153
01:12:14,536 --> 01:12:16,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god!

1154
01:12:16,257 --> 01:12:18,279
[SPEAKER_21]: You just talked over it, you stupid bitch!

1155
01:12:18,879 --> 01:12:19,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god!

1156
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1157
01:12:29,204 --> 01:12:30,085
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hilarious.

1158
01:12:31,426 --> 01:12:32,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

1159
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:36,970
[SPEAKER_07]: That was more than a question, sorry.

1160
01:12:38,491 --> 01:12:41,714
[SPEAKER_08]: You should play all of the old promos or buffers or whatever.

1161
01:12:41,794 --> 01:12:42,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you can't.

1162
01:12:42,615 --> 01:12:45,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, you could string them in a sequence or something.

1163
01:12:45,637 --> 01:12:46,678
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of them are stupid.

1164
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:48,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I love them.

1165
01:12:48,559 --> 01:12:49,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are so stupid.

1166
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:50,961
[SPEAKER_08]: They were like the ketchup.

1167
01:12:50,981 --> 01:12:54,524
[SPEAKER_20]: I still have the nori, nori, nori promo.

1168
01:12:54,983 --> 01:12:55,644
[SPEAKER_20]: That never aired.

1169
01:12:56,384 --> 01:12:57,065
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, wow.

1170
01:12:57,145 --> 01:12:57,966
[SPEAKER_20]: That's old school.

1171
01:12:57,986 --> 01:12:58,766
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll send it to you later.

1172
01:12:58,786 --> 01:12:59,127
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1173
01:12:59,947 --> 01:13:10,857
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite moment in Orange Lounge Radio history was the drunk show where Jamie drank so much tequila she lied in my bed face down after consuming an entire box of waffles.

1174
01:13:10,877 --> 01:13:11,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't face down.

1175
01:13:12,018 --> 01:13:14,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And had me delivering waffles to her.

1176
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:19,404
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was running up the wall yelling, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.

1177
01:13:20,665 --> 01:13:22,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And how sober was I by the end of the show?

1178
01:13:23,893 --> 01:13:26,795
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't forget Super Bacon either.

1179
01:13:26,915 --> 01:13:29,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder why my pancreas is fucked.

1180
01:13:29,597 --> 01:13:31,819
[SPEAKER_06]: The deep fried rice.

1181
01:13:32,499 --> 01:13:33,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when we did peep jousting?

1182
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Peep Wars!

1183
01:13:34,641 --> 01:13:36,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was actually on a Wednesday night show.

1184
01:13:36,922 --> 01:13:49,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically you take two marshmallow peeps and you put toothpicks in them and then put them in the microwave and it's peep jousting because they get really big in the microwave and then eventually one slaughters the other.

1185
01:13:50,031 --> 01:13:51,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fucking hilarious.

1186
01:13:52,393 --> 01:13:52,693
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1187
01:13:52,733 --> 01:13:53,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Good time.

1188
01:13:53,314 --> 01:13:54,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1189
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:55,235
[SPEAKER_02]: State your name.

1190
01:13:56,236 --> 01:13:57,377
GS68.

1191
01:13:57,637 --> 01:13:58,597
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68.

1192
01:13:58,918 --> 01:14:01,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is your question for tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?

1193
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Any progress on the Faname panel?

1194
01:14:04,281 --> 01:14:06,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Any progress on the Faname panel?

1195
01:14:06,683 --> 01:14:06,923
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1196
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:09,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.

1197
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:10,686
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more than a question.

1198
01:14:11,726 --> 01:14:16,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I remember correctly, that's Memorial Day weekend, which is the first weekend in May?

1199
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:17,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1200
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:18,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Last weekend in May.

1201
01:14:18,351 --> 01:14:18,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Last weekend in May.

1202
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:19,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1203
01:14:21,293 --> 01:14:21,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1204
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:22,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know.

1205
01:14:45,742 --> 01:14:46,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Nelly with me, unfortunately.

1206
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:15,156
[SPEAKER_00]: I have actually a very favorite moment in live 365 history.

1207
01:15:15,917 --> 01:15:17,999
[SPEAKER_02]: You better phrase it as a question or you're in trouble.

1208
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:20,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1209
01:15:21,261 --> 01:15:22,382
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Jeopardy, bitch.

1210
01:15:24,203 --> 01:15:26,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember when Loki sang Oops I Did It Again?

1211
01:15:29,403 --> 01:15:32,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember it, but I sort of remember vaguely doing something that wasn't funny.

1212
01:15:32,846 --> 01:15:33,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It was still pretty damn funny.

1213
01:16:00,754 --> 01:16:06,878
[SPEAKER_02]: How much do you charge for autographed Xbox 360 faceplates, and what's your favorite dish at the Olive Garden?

1214
01:16:24,775 --> 01:16:26,976
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a two-part question, you little bastard.

1215
01:16:27,456 --> 01:16:27,916
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

1216
01:16:27,936 --> 01:16:28,676
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll let it slide.

1217
01:16:30,417 --> 01:16:30,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

1218
01:16:31,157 --> 01:16:33,618
[SPEAKER_02]: How much do we charge for an autographed Xbox 360 faceplate?

1219
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:36,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see why we wouldn't charge anything more than the cost of the faceplate plus shipping.

1220
01:16:37,179 --> 01:16:39,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're not out to make a profit on it.

1221
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:43,201
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want one, which I hear you do, we'll work something out.

1222
01:16:43,942 --> 01:16:45,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some extra faceplates.

1223
01:16:45,622 --> 01:16:45,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you?

1224
01:16:46,283 --> 01:16:46,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1225
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:47,383
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to just give them one?

1226
01:16:48,928 --> 01:16:51,450
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to airbrush it white and then autograph it.

1227
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:55,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have no extra white ones because I bought other ones.

1228
01:16:55,793 --> 01:16:55,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1229
01:16:56,274 --> 01:16:57,655
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll figure something out, Osfer.

1230
01:16:57,675 --> 01:16:59,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other question, I like this one.

1231
01:16:59,096 --> 01:17:00,797
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite dish at the Olive Garden?

1232
01:17:03,939 --> 01:17:04,560
[SPEAKER_06]: The breadsticks.

1233
01:17:06,401 --> 01:17:11,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine was the, what did they call it, pasta rustica or something like that?

1234
01:17:11,525 --> 01:17:13,286
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got rid of it, those assholes.

1235
01:17:13,566 --> 01:17:15,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I like the Tuscan chicken.

1236
01:17:15,247 --> 01:17:16,008
[SPEAKER_02]: They got rid of that, too.

1237
01:17:16,994 --> 01:17:17,995
[SPEAKER_02]: What a bunch of fuckers.

1238
01:17:18,055 --> 01:17:19,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm mad at all of them right now.

1239
01:17:19,075 --> 01:17:21,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's not allowed to tell anybody he likes anything at the Olive Garden.

1240
01:17:21,097 --> 01:17:24,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't eat them anymore anyway, at least for the next month while I'm on this.

1241
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm rather plain, so I always get the spaghetti with meat sauce.

1242
01:17:26,921 --> 01:17:27,741
[SPEAKER_02]: You are boring.

1243
01:17:27,761 --> 01:17:29,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I always used to get the shrimp scampi.

1244
01:17:29,743 --> 01:17:30,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Folksenbach?

1245
01:17:30,383 --> 01:17:30,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Shrimp scampi?

1246
01:17:31,204 --> 01:17:33,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I really like the risotto.

1247
01:17:34,446 --> 01:17:38,809
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the name of that chicken dish on our first or third date or something that I got?

1248
01:17:39,049 --> 01:17:39,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Like,

1249
01:17:39,704 --> 01:17:41,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, some chicken dish with pasta.

1250
01:17:41,426 --> 01:17:44,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also like their zuppa, whatever the hell's in it.

1251
01:17:44,348 --> 01:17:48,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the white one with sausage and potatoes.

1252
01:17:49,133 --> 01:17:49,893
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really good.

1253
01:17:49,913 --> 01:17:51,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, my pancreas hurts just thinking about it.

1254
01:17:51,955 --> 01:17:53,196
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thanks for the question, caller.

1255
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:53,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

1256
01:17:53,917 --> 01:17:55,318
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll figure something out about that faceplate.

1257
01:17:55,999 --> 01:17:58,161
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Skype line's still open.

1258
01:17:58,181 --> 01:17:58,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any need to close.

1259
01:17:58,982 --> 01:18:00,243
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the calls are so short tonight.

1260
01:18:00,823 --> 01:18:01,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Caller, please state your name.

1261
01:18:03,206 --> 01:18:04,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It's SSJ100, Matt.

1262
01:18:04,387 --> 01:18:05,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, and please state your question.

1263
01:18:09,286 --> 01:18:12,547
[SPEAKER_18]: My question is, what would be your dream interview to have on the show?

1264
01:18:13,908 --> 01:18:15,969
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your dream interview.

1265
01:18:15,989 --> 01:18:16,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Akira Yamaoka.

1266
01:18:32,324 --> 01:18:33,724
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked to him.

1267
01:18:34,225 --> 01:18:37,685
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we didn't have him on the show, but we've seen him in person.

1268
01:18:38,026 --> 01:18:39,266
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, you narrowly missed it.

1269
01:18:39,806 --> 01:18:48,868
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, because somebody wanted to go interview somebody and lost the recording of the damn interview.

1270
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:51,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll throw a curveball at you in just a minute.

1271
01:18:51,109 --> 01:18:52,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you why, too.

1272
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:56,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew, what would be your dream interview to see us interview?

1273
01:18:57,491 --> 01:18:58,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Freeze Pop.

1274
01:18:58,965 --> 01:19:00,446
[SPEAKER_02]: We had one guy on the show, remember?

1275
01:19:01,046 --> 01:19:01,327
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.

1276
01:19:01,367 --> 01:19:01,727
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.

1277
01:19:01,827 --> 01:19:03,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in studio performing a la Mo.

1278
01:19:04,629 --> 01:19:04,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1279
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:05,269
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1280
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:05,869
[SPEAKER_02]: A la Mo.

1281
01:19:05,909 --> 01:19:06,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

1282
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:08,011
[SPEAKER_02]: A la Mo.

1283
01:19:09,212 --> 01:19:11,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess.

1284
01:19:11,673 --> 01:19:15,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Christian Bale naked in front of me.

1285
01:19:16,036 --> 01:19:16,936
[SPEAKER_20]: You're asking too much.

1286
01:19:16,956 --> 01:19:18,137
[SPEAKER_20]: Via a unicorn.

1287
01:19:18,297 --> 01:19:19,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Via a unicorn.

1288
01:19:19,978 --> 01:19:21,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And there won't be a lot of talking.

1289
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to say this.

1290
01:19:23,821 --> 01:19:25,702
[SPEAKER_02]: My dream interview would be Morgan Webb.

1291
01:19:26,903 --> 01:19:27,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Because...

1292
01:19:28,547 --> 01:19:29,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have a field day.

1293
01:19:29,288 --> 01:19:30,830
[SPEAKER_20]: You better have a damn good reason.

1294
01:19:31,751 --> 01:19:32,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have a field day.

1295
01:19:32,432 --> 01:19:32,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait.

1296
01:19:32,972 --> 01:19:33,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta stop you real quick.

1297
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:34,154
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1298
01:19:34,314 --> 01:19:36,837
[SPEAKER_05]: They posted an old video clip of her.

1299
01:19:37,177 --> 01:19:37,958
[SPEAKER_05]: She was on the Tyra Bank.

1300
01:19:37,978 --> 01:19:38,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, caller.

1301
01:19:38,519 --> 01:19:39,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the question.

1302
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,166
[SPEAKER_05]: She was actually on the Tyra Bank show one time and spouting off some, like, three...

1303
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:50,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Three different types of gamers and what you can learn from your guy based on the types of games he played.

1304
01:19:50,563 --> 01:19:52,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was so retarded.

1305
01:19:53,225 --> 01:19:54,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the chat room is yelling at me.

1306
01:19:54,606 --> 01:19:59,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want the interview because I think it's going to be... Let me ask her some questions in public.

1307
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:00,731
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I want.

1308
01:20:02,272 --> 01:20:02,632
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1309
01:20:03,473 --> 01:20:04,894
[SPEAKER_08]: You forgot Nathan.

1310
01:20:05,194 --> 01:20:05,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Nathan.

1311
01:20:06,975 --> 01:20:08,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have anything to say.

1312
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:09,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it.

1313
01:20:09,577 --> 01:20:10,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

1314
01:20:12,296 --> 01:20:13,256
[SPEAKER_02]: He's so emotional.

1315
01:20:13,636 --> 01:20:14,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Caller, state your name.

1316
01:20:17,178 --> 01:20:17,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello?

1317
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:19,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, caller, what is your name?

1318
01:20:19,678 --> 01:20:21,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, um, Gold Banjo here.

1319
01:20:21,999 --> 01:20:22,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Gold.

1320
01:20:22,459 --> 01:20:29,901
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering, seeing as how you're at, like, an internet radio show and all, I'm wondering if anybody's ever, like, threatened you or stalked you or something?

1321
01:20:30,722 --> 01:20:31,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1322
01:20:31,622 --> 01:20:33,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, threatened us or stalked us.

1323
01:20:33,783 --> 01:20:34,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.

1324
01:20:34,323 --> 01:20:35,283
[SPEAKER_02]: No one stalked you.

1325
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:37,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't remember anyone.

1326
01:20:40,265 --> 01:20:40,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, who?

1327
01:20:41,105 --> 01:20:41,225
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1328
01:20:43,616 --> 01:20:44,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God!

1329
01:20:45,398 --> 01:20:45,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he?

1330
01:20:47,861 --> 01:20:48,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1331
01:20:48,722 --> 01:20:49,203
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1332
01:20:49,503 --> 01:20:51,706
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a person that was borderline stalking me.

1333
01:20:54,109 --> 01:20:55,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm listening to what you're saying now.

1334
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:21,572
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1335
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:41,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we've ever really had anything beyond that, though.

1336
01:21:41,802 --> 01:21:44,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was more just kind of like a silly internet prank.

1337
01:21:44,724 --> 01:21:47,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that that's acceptable.

1338
01:21:47,205 --> 01:21:47,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.

1339
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:50,187
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody's ever threatened us with death or anything.

1340
01:21:50,207 --> 01:21:52,929
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're not famous.

1341
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:53,930
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1342
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:56,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll threaten you with death if you don't change your vote.

1343
01:21:57,172 --> 01:21:57,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1344
01:21:58,413 --> 01:21:58,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

1345
01:21:58,933 --> 01:21:59,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, callers.

1346
01:21:59,774 --> 01:22:00,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name.

1347
01:22:02,235 --> 01:22:02,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, what's up?

1348
01:22:02,655 --> 01:22:03,816
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Ross Steel, UT.

1349
01:22:03,856 --> 01:22:04,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Ross Steel, UT.

1350
01:22:04,977 --> 01:22:06,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And please state your question.

1351
01:22:08,188 --> 01:22:12,953
[SPEAKER_18]: How many blind monkeys do you think it took for Ubisoft to come up with the name HAWX?

1352
01:22:15,236 --> 01:22:15,957
[SPEAKER_02]: One for each letter.

1353
01:22:16,077 --> 01:22:16,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Four.

1354
01:22:20,322 --> 01:22:20,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Only one.

1355
01:22:21,183 --> 01:22:26,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you have to understand, Hawks is edgy because they have an X instead of a KS.

1356
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:28,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We're thinking 90s now.

1357
01:22:30,296 --> 01:22:31,216
[SPEAKER_22]: It took 90 monkeys?

1358
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:32,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's extreme.

1359
01:22:32,577 --> 01:22:33,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1360
01:22:33,297 --> 01:22:35,417
[SPEAKER_02]: You're laughing too much, and that's more than a question.

1361
01:22:35,457 --> 01:22:36,058
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but just kidding.

1362
01:22:36,078 --> 01:22:36,958
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got to free up the line.

1363
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:37,318
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1364
01:22:37,338 --> 01:22:39,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this.

1365
01:22:39,979 --> 01:22:41,799
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like a condensed... It's great.

1366
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:47,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how many people were getting in tonight for the last... Okay, we still got... I know there's still people trying to get in, so I'm waiting.

1367
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:49,041
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1368
01:22:49,061 --> 01:22:49,961
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.

1369
01:22:50,041 --> 01:22:50,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Another call.

1370
01:22:51,001 --> 01:22:52,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, caller.

1371
01:22:52,182 --> 01:22:53,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name.

1372
01:22:54,528 --> 01:22:56,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, this is your favorite Swede, AK River.

1373
01:22:56,689 --> 01:22:59,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you start out in Live 365 in the first place?

1374
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Go figure it comes from someone not from America.

1375
01:23:16,977 --> 01:23:20,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did we start on Life 365 in the first place?

1376
01:23:21,822 --> 01:23:22,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my answer.

1377
01:23:22,563 --> 01:23:23,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anyone else wants to contribute.

1378
01:23:24,005 --> 01:23:24,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It was easy.

1379
01:23:25,246 --> 01:23:25,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

1380
01:23:25,887 --> 01:23:27,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, two reasons.

1381
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,250
[SPEAKER_02]: A, it was easy.

1382
01:23:29,136 --> 01:23:29,636
[SPEAKER_02]: www.DarkSakura.com

1383
01:23:59,142 --> 01:23:59,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1384
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:22,204
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't talk about that very much

1385
01:24:49,713 --> 01:24:50,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if we get some more.

1386
01:24:50,814 --> 01:24:55,456
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR How many more times?

1387
01:24:55,516 --> 01:24:57,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, this segment's going long.

1388
01:24:57,638 --> 01:24:58,898
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright, it's the last.

1389
01:24:59,599 --> 01:25:00,479
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a little time, right?

1390
01:25:00,499 --> 01:25:01,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are okay?

1391
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Jamie's starting to get a little restless.

1392
01:25:03,021 --> 01:25:04,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We gotta wind down soon.

1393
01:25:04,422 --> 01:25:06,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, hello caller, please state your name.

1394
01:25:10,245 --> 01:25:10,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

1395
01:25:10,885 --> 01:25:12,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, hi caller, please state your name.

1396
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:16,348
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Misty.

1397
01:25:16,989 --> 01:25:18,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hello, Misty!

1398
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:20,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to hear from Misty.

1399
01:25:21,155 --> 01:25:26,599
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Misty, I know you probably went waiting forever to get in, but please state your question.

1400
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:36,925
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to win the lottery and bribe all of your bosses with however much they needed, would you people fucking come to ASEN?

1401
01:25:38,506 --> 01:25:39,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to.

1402
01:25:39,847 --> 01:25:45,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been... Sweetie, I love you.

1403
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:46,391
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, this is Misty.

1404
01:25:46,974 --> 01:25:50,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, really want to go to Ace and I've been bringing this up since last year.

1405
01:26:05,055 --> 01:26:09,182
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get our asses to Chicago and go to a convention.

1406
01:26:09,543 --> 01:26:12,828
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually need to finish one of my costumes to actually be able to wear it there.

1407
01:26:13,409 --> 01:26:17,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also want to go hang out in Artist Alley with Megzi and Chris because they're going to be there this year too.

1408
01:26:18,414 --> 01:26:22,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I would be going this year if it wasn't for my medical issues.

1409
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:28,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I really was considering going this year and making it happen, but my medical issues have made me think twice about it.

1410
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:29,169
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very unfortunate.

1411
01:26:29,209 --> 01:26:30,110
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

1412
01:26:30,431 --> 01:26:33,315
[SPEAKER_02]: If a miracle pulls through in the next week, I might reconsider.

1413
01:26:33,495 --> 01:26:34,837
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now I have to say no.

1414
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:38,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, any chance in hell you'd go to ASIN?

1415
01:26:38,502 --> 01:26:40,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if she won the lottery and paid for it for you?

1416
01:26:40,824 --> 01:26:45,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if she won the lottery, my wife... I can't go because my wife can't stay home alone.

1417
01:26:45,088 --> 01:26:46,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I represent us at ASIN?

1418
01:26:47,309 --> 01:26:51,233
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can go, sure, go for it.

1419
01:26:51,473 --> 01:26:53,995
[SPEAKER_06]: If someone pays my way, I'll go to ASIN.

1420
01:26:54,535 --> 01:26:56,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the call.

1421
01:26:56,797 --> 01:26:57,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone give Misty a kiss.

1422
01:26:58,198 --> 01:26:59,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye, Misty.

1423
01:27:02,374 --> 01:27:04,735
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fun fact from Bobby Blackwolf.

1424
01:27:04,855 --> 01:27:08,356
[SPEAKER_02]: All Games Radio was on Live 365 in one of its incarnations.

1425
01:27:08,496 --> 01:27:13,377
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they used to give people the link to OLR to test the Live 365 player.

1426
01:27:14,017 --> 01:27:14,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1427
01:27:14,378 --> 01:27:15,098
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

1428
01:27:15,338 --> 01:27:18,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know... Isn't it funny how things come full circle?

1429
01:27:19,259 --> 01:27:20,399
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, maybe one more.

1430
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:21,179
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.

1431
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:22,840
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1432
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to get Misty in because I know she doesn't get to listen live much and...

1433
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,352
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I gave Misty the pass.

1434
01:27:29,613 --> 01:27:30,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she's special.

1435
01:27:31,335 --> 01:27:32,176
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a girl thing.

1436
01:27:32,477 --> 01:27:33,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Admit it.

1437
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:35,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

1438
01:27:35,441 --> 01:27:35,842
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.

1439
01:27:36,182 --> 01:27:37,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Last call, last question.

1440
01:27:38,225 --> 01:27:38,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

1441
01:27:38,726 --> 01:27:39,647
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the last one.

1442
01:27:39,707 --> 01:27:40,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name.

1443
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:42,110
[SPEAKER_02]: E.T.

1444
01:27:42,887 --> 01:27:44,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, DT.

1445
01:27:44,988 --> 01:27:53,430
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, we all need to tip our hat to Dark Tetsuya for a moment and praise him for the work he's done for our station because he's been listening here since episode one.

1446
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:55,351
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been a longtime supporter.

1447
01:27:55,691 --> 01:28:00,693
[SPEAKER_02]: He writes website articles for our front page even when the damn thing is deader than a doornail.

1448
01:28:01,093 --> 01:28:03,394
[SPEAKER_02]: He has updated the OLR wiki with articles.

1449
01:28:03,714 --> 01:28:05,735
[SPEAKER_02]: He keeps things posted on the forum.

1450
01:28:06,055 --> 01:28:10,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, everybody, let's give Dark Tetsuya a round of applause for the hard work he's done for our station.

1451
01:28:15,228 --> 01:28:15,688
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya, please...

1452
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,772
[SPEAKER_02]: The last question of the night for Last Scorn's Lounge.

1453
01:28:49,094 --> 01:28:50,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, let me set this up.

1454
01:28:52,657 --> 01:28:57,240
[SPEAKER_17]: As you know, she... Go ahead.

1455
01:28:59,781 --> 01:29:03,024
[SPEAKER_17]: She is planning on coming to California in October.

1456
01:29:05,745 --> 01:29:09,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Wouldn't there be a chance of getting her on the show somehow?

1457
01:29:11,109 --> 01:29:12,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Is she going to be here on a Sunday?

1458
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:12,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Her and I.

1459
01:29:13,334 --> 01:29:14,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'll have to find out Wow

1460
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:43,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1461
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:44,961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a dream of mine.

1462
01:30:11,292 --> 01:30:15,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, damn, that's a lot of calls tonight and I think it's time to wrap things up.

1463
01:30:15,095 --> 01:30:16,676
[SPEAKER_02]: We already did last minute stories.

1464
01:30:18,057 --> 01:30:20,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, we missed one thing though.

1465
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:24,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I was supposed to do it after the list list tonight and I completely glossed over it.

1466
01:30:24,582 --> 01:30:26,183
[SPEAKER_02]: What segment did I forget, boys and girls?

1467
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:28,325
[SPEAKER_02]: What segment did we forget?

1468
01:30:28,345 --> 01:30:30,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the FU's of the week.

1469
01:30:31,888 --> 01:30:33,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I gotta get the music.

1470
01:30:33,449 --> 01:30:34,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap.

1471
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be hilarious?

1472
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:37,792
[SPEAKER_06]: This entire show's been an FU to Life 365.

1473
01:30:39,982 --> 01:30:41,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So, whatever.

1474
01:30:41,323 --> 01:30:45,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, hold on really quickly, because I've got to set this up here.

1475
01:30:45,144 --> 01:30:46,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may hear just a moment of silence.

1476
01:30:46,424 --> 01:30:48,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'll let the music play for a little bit.

1477
01:30:50,066 --> 01:31:04,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Let the music play.

1478
01:31:05,351 --> 01:31:07,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, the FUs of the week.

1479
01:31:07,172 --> 01:31:08,392
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, start us off.

1480
01:31:09,235 --> 01:31:26,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you, Live365 Loki Fuck you, Live365 Drew Fuck you, Live365 Rice Princess Fuck you, Live365 Silent Nathan And my F.U.

1481
01:31:26,927 --> 01:31:28,428
[SPEAKER_03]: of the week F.U.

1482
01:31:28,468 --> 01:31:36,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Live365 For upping your rates and using scare tactics to motivate it And F.U.

1483
01:31:36,173 --> 01:31:36,774
[SPEAKER_02]: the R.I.A.

1484
01:31:37,406 --> 01:31:40,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for starting the whole damn thing in the first place.

1485
01:31:41,528 --> 01:31:44,970
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, this all goes back to you assholes forgetting our names.

1486
01:31:46,190 --> 01:31:51,433
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, I got to say in seriousness, we have met some good people at Live365.

1487
01:31:52,093 --> 01:31:53,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Betty, she was a real sweetheart.

1488
01:31:54,154 --> 01:31:55,254
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some great people.

1489
01:31:55,274 --> 01:31:56,415
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got speakers.

1490
01:31:57,159 --> 01:32:03,441
[SPEAKER_02]: When we say F you, we mean to the corporate decisions that were made there and not necessarily the people.

1491
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:10,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to get that out there because in our five and a half years, we have interacted with a lot of great people and other broadcasters that we've met through Live 365.

1492
01:32:10,903 --> 01:32:13,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So please don't misappropriate our angst.

1493
01:32:13,884 --> 01:32:14,184
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1494
01:32:14,684 --> 01:32:19,765
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyhow, that brings us to the very last part where we give our final thoughts.

1495
01:32:20,886 --> 01:32:22,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Nathan, any final thoughts?

1496
01:32:24,567 --> 01:32:25,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess, your final thoughts?

1497
01:32:29,741 --> 01:32:30,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew, your final thought.

1498
01:32:30,943 --> 01:32:31,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Indignation.

1499
01:32:33,165 --> 01:32:34,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

1500
01:32:34,247 --> 01:32:38,491
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I need to play some more games other than Saints Row.

1501
01:32:38,612 --> 01:32:40,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I may go back to Saints Row to finish the activities.

1502
01:32:41,375 --> 01:32:42,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta get them achievement points.

1503
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:47,462
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week... I'm sorry, not my FU of the week.

1504
01:32:48,667 --> 01:32:55,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it goes back to my pancreas, honestly, but my final thought is I really don't want it to flare up again and end up in the hospital.

1505
01:32:56,009 --> 01:33:00,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to sound like a baby in a hypochondriac, but keep your fingers crossed for me, kid.

1506
01:33:01,511 --> 01:33:02,251
[SPEAKER_02]: The ferret is next.

1507
01:33:03,152 --> 01:33:04,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferret, your final thought, please.

1508
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:08,113
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Dark... All right, shut up.

1509
01:33:08,133 --> 01:33:09,014
[SPEAKER_02]: You had two final thoughts.

1510
01:33:09,114 --> 01:33:10,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, your final thought.

1511
01:33:10,914 --> 01:33:11,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Reject false icons.

1512
01:33:12,635 --> 01:33:12,915
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1513
01:33:14,266 --> 01:33:21,110
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for Orange Lounge Radio, the last live program here on our network on Live 365.

1514
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:24,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to all that have supported us since May 23rd.

1515
01:33:25,965 --> 01:33:26,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1516
01:33:54,611 --> 01:34:01,856
[SPEAKER_02]: All you guys on the forums, all you guys on LiveJournal, Myspace, Facebook, and everybody that downloads this show, thank you for five and a half years.

1517
01:34:01,976 --> 01:34:09,021
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been fun on our own stream, but the party ain't over, and we look forward to the next chapter of Orange Laundry.

1518
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:10,402
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really big chapter one.

1519
01:34:10,442 --> 01:34:11,642
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like War and Peace right here.

1520
01:34:11,943 --> 01:34:18,367
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to the next chapter of OLR when we combine forces with All Games Radio.

1521
01:34:19,375 --> 01:34:23,898
[SPEAKER_02]: and come together to make the Voltron of independent gaming podcasting.

1522
01:34:24,278 --> 01:34:29,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, if you like what you hear, tell a couple friends about Orange Lounge Radio.

1523
01:34:29,281 --> 01:34:37,505
[SPEAKER_02]: It's word of mouth that helps make everything go around and brings more listeners to us so that we can slowly take over the world.

1524
01:34:38,766 --> 01:34:40,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So, can I rant anymore?

1525
01:34:41,547 --> 01:34:42,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that it?

1526
01:34:42,528 --> 01:34:43,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we done?

1527
01:34:43,288 --> 01:34:44,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we out of here?

1528
01:34:44,529 --> 01:34:44,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1529
01:34:44,869 --> 01:34:45,409
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

1530
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:46,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Goodbye, Life365.

1531
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:46,290
