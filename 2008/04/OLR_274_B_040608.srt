00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,840
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April 6th of 2008.

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,040
We are live here on our stream for the last time on Live 365.

3
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,280
This is the last piece of live programming, but for you people that download and listen

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,640
to our podcast every week faithfully, not a darn thing is going to change for you.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,040
But we do invite you all to come on and listen to a live show, participate in the chat room.

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,320
The new place to do it will be www.allgames.com starting on Sunday the 13th.

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,320
But meanwhile, we still have some of this week's news to take care of, so let's kick

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,240
off this week's news for Part B with Loki.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:03,820
So it's no surprise with the Dualshock 3 being released here anytime now that they're going

10
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,800
to be pulling the plug on the 6-axis, basically throwing motors in those old 6-axis controllers

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,440
that they have lying around and putting a new shell on it.

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,360
So if you're looking for a rumble-less controller, you're going to be out of luck.

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,760
However though, if you want to get with the times and actually have a controller with

14
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,640
that last-gen rumble technology in there, then feel free to head to the store, probably

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,920
now, and go pick one up.

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,800
Ross2UT says, That sucks!

17
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I like the 6-axis.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,000
That comment from chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What do you think?

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,560
I mean, good thing or bad thing about this?

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,360
I think it just kind of sucks because it's going to cost so much money to replace now,

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,520
but I guess new console owners won't really care.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,520
I kind of anticipated this was going to happen, so I already sold back two of my controllers.

24
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,960
So I just have two more now that I just have to replace.

25
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,800
But the thing is, though, now I think you're going to be fucked if you try to trade them

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,920
in like GameStop or something like that because no one's going to want them.

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
The value has gone down big time on that.

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
That's true.

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
No future games are going to support them, right?

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
No they will.

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,520
It just won't have rumble, probably.

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,960
The rumble will be disabled.

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Gotcha.

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,760
Well, that's not the only thing Sony is doing.

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,720
Sony is shutting down the PS2 and PSP gaming servers for some of the online games.

36
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,240
Some games are no longer going to work after June 30th.

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,620
Now here's the weird thing.

38
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,160
One of the games on the list is Amplitude, but I thought that game already went down.

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,560
So some of these games, I think, are already gone because didn't Amplitude go down some

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
time ago?

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,120
Like they had Harmonix developers on the last night and everything?

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
I don't know.

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
Well, Sony is shutting down these servers.

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:53,560
There's a report, let's see, Jack X, Lemmings PS2, My Streets, Syphon, Filter Omega Strain,

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,240
Twisted Metal Black Online, Everybody's Golf, yeah, all those are all going away.

46
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,000
On the PSP, Lemmings and World Tour Soccer Tour, or World Tour Soccer 2.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,880
Naturally, you can still continue to play those games offline, but what was that?

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,400
Those two games, those Twisted Metal Black Online had no offline version.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,800
That game is useless now if you own it, and same with ItoyChat, it was only online.

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Was ItoyChat on that list?

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
I didn't even see it.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Yeah, ItoyChat was online.

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Doh!

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,880
Were there that many people in ItoyChat though?

55
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
I don't think so.

56
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,840
I remember seeing that and I was like, God, that's retarded.

57
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,760
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm still pissed off from when the Amplitude servers went offline.

58
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,640
But Twisted Metal Black Online kind of sucks though that there's no offline mode for that.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,280
I don't know.

60
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Whatever.

61
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,360
Alright, well those servers are bye-bye.

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,520
I wonder if somehow old news didn't leak through as new news this week, and we're getting fooled

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,960
too, because I swear that Amplitude thing is like a year old.

64
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,760
That was supposed to happen on June 30th.

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Alright.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,920
PSP, I've never heard of PSP games shutting their server down, so that element's new,

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,420
for sure.

68
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,720
Maybe some wires got crossed, I don't know.

69
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,000
Maybe it was Frequency that was getting shut down last time.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No, Amplitude?

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
For you seeing it was never online.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I miss Amplitude though.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That was a great game.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I wish they'd make a sequel.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,720
I wish that my computer wasn't being messed up right now.

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Uh-oh.

78
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,080
Are you having problems connecting to the network?

79
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,920
Okay, there it is.

80
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,280
So, for some reason what happens is that, and this is just with my crappy laptop, is

81
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,600
that I'll have several different Firefox windows open, and then one of them will suddenly vanish.

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Fun.

83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,440
Until I minimize everything else.

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Live Radio, what can you do?

85
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Yeah, really.

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:42,480
Criterion is going to be transforming Burnout Paradise by doing a whole crap ton of updates.

87
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,920
The first of these is called Cagney, and they're all going to be named.

88
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,880
So as far as it's listed, there's going to be Cagney, Davis, Eastwood.

89
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,400
I guess so far that just looks like it's alphabetical, so whatever.

90
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
If there's one called Cagney, there has to be one called Lacy.

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Come on.

92
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
That'll be when they get to L.

93
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Okay.

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,400
So they're saying that these patches are going to be coming out over the year.

95
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Well that's good.

96
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,960
They're going to keep the game fresh, and that's one of those games I played a lot for

97
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,040
two days, and I'm just kind of collecting dust right now, which is too bad.

98
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,000
They were showing off some pretty cool trailers for the new, well the first download content

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
for the game, which is going to be a new island.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's pretty cool.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,080
And then there's going to be a new off-road dune buggy type car that's going to be coming

102
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
in there.

103
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Still looking forward to that.

104
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,120
Actually I'm just kind of keeping my game on the shelf to collect dust in the meantime

105
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,600
until they actually release that stuff, and then I'll go play it again.

106
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,640
I'm glad they're giving us reasons to go back, though.

107
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,680
I still need to finish Earth Defense Force 2017.

108
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,720
I finished Saints Row, so that's awesome.

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
Sunday, right?

110
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Yeah.

111
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
So, let's see.

112
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,160
Some other cool stuff, I don't know, this may be cool if you're into Gran Turismo, or

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,000
if you have perhaps, I don't know, a younger sibling that you're trying to get into Gran

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Turismo.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,480
Apparently there's a game that they were talking about a while back called Gran Turismo for

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,640
Boys.

117
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,760
It was going to be a kid-friendly game, or kid-friendly version of Gran Turismo.

118
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,960
I guess it would be a lot easier for them to kind of get sucked into.

119
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't think they should call it Gran Turismo for Boys.

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,040
I think the better name would be Gran Turismo for Kids, or something like that, since we

121
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,120
don't want to limit which gender can play the game.

122
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,140
But anyways, they were saying that that actually might come back in some form as part of Gran

123
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,040
Turismo 5, the standalone game.

124
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,560
And of course, when they were first announcing Gran Turismo for Boys, it was revealed in

125
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,840
November 2004 by Yakimuchi, and kind of the way to hook preteens on cars.

126
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,040
I guess, kind of like Hot Wheels or something.

127
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,480
How exactly do you do that?

128
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,160
Is it just that the cars are a little more silly, or what?

129
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,840
I don't know if it's a little more silly, maybe easier to tune or something like that,

130
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,760
maybe they walk them through on how to tune the cars.

131
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,860
I need that mode, I can't do all that stuff in those games.

132
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,960
That's why those types of games like Gran Turismo 4 aren't really for me, because there's

133
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,720
too much of that car shop stuff that I'm not really into.

134
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,880
I like Crazy Taxi, just push the pedal and go, and try to drive into people.

135
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,560
Have you seen that new game, it's supposed to be coming out in a couple weeks, Emergency

136
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Mayhem.

137
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,400
It's just like Crazy Taxi, but with little Wiimote mini games and emergency vehicles.

138
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Fun!

139
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,840
So, like, instead of taking him to Pizza Hut, you take him to the ER?

140
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,880
No, instead of, for example, it'll be like, oh, there's a dumpster on fire, and you have

141
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,280
to race over there and then put it out, you know.

142
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,120
And if somebody dies, it's game over.

143
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,560
Then someone's dying or whatever, you have to resuscitate them and stuff.

144
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
I don't know, it looks like fun.

145
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,600
What if I want to drive to the dumpster and feed the fire?

146
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,100
I don't know, maybe you can do that?

147
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,360
Throw the body into the dumpster.

148
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,920
Because I have to throw my passenger in the fire, that would be fun.

149
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,800
Well, that sounds more like a game that Rockstar would put together, and maybe they could do

150
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,480
that because they have more resources as of this week.

151
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,880
They've acquired a company called Mad Dog, I'm sorry, Mad Doc Software, Mad Dog is something

152
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,800
different, Mad Doc Software, and this now comes together and they form Rockstar New

153
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
England.

154
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,900
So Mad Doc Software hailed as one of the premier independent development studios in North America.

155
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,560
And so they're saying, the team at Mad Doc Software is extremely talented, bringing them

156
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,400
within the Rockstar Games family will enhance our core technology and further support our

157
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,160
commitment to creating progressive and innovative gaming experiences.

158
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,320
So another merger, and that's the sound of the corporate suck-up, and the last game they

159
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:55,520
worked on was the Bully Scholarship Edition, so port, and a broken one at that.

160
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,480
Gotcha, so it could be that more games are going to get ported, maybe that Grand Theft

161
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,960
Auto on DS isn't so incorrect, who knows?

162
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,640
Hey, I'm down for Grand Theft Auto game on DS, they have it on PSP.

163
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,160
Did you see that rumor about it earlier this week?

164
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,080
I think it's a misprint, I don't think it's, I mean something like that, they couldn't

165
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,600
really put Grand Theft Auto IV on the DS, unless it was top down, which would be pretty

166
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
cool.

167
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,360
All right, so now we're going to get into another segment here on the program, and we

168
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,700
like to do this every week, and this segment isn't going away or changing at all, we still

169
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,940
continue to ask you guys to email us every week with whatever feedback you have for the

170
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,940
program.

171
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
We do?

172
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,440
Yes, we do, like it or not.

173
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Okay.

174
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,680
All right, and we call it our mailbag, so if you want to send us some emails, mailbag

175
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,200
at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send them, DarkSakura dives into the mailbag every

176
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,160
week and picks out a few of her favorite emails to read here on the air, and that's, you do,

177
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,440
because you're going to do it right now, or else, or else you go in that dumpster.

178
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
No.

179
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Fire.

180
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,640
So, he just, Rob doesn't sing the intro for me anymore, anyway.

181
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,720
Maybe on all games I will, maybe.

182
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
On the fuck show I will.

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,040
He didn't sing the mailbag intro, I thought it was very-

184
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,760
That was the Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

185
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,840
Yeah, Let's Ask Orange Lounge, which we haven't done in a long time.

186
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,440
Why don't we?

187
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
We should do one-

188
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,560
For our Skype segment, let it be that.

189
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
You mean no Skype calls tonight?

190
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,160
No, let them call it on Skype, but have it be-

191
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,200
But they get to ask a question, that's it.

192
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,920
If they do anything else, we hang up on them.

193
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
That's it.

194
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Okay.

195
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I love that idea.

196
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,240
So, tonight's Skype segment is Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

197
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,920
You call in, ask a question, that's it.

198
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,520
You try to deviate the call, we hang up on you.

199
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
I love that idea.

200
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
This is a great mailbag.

201
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Although we do take bribes.

202
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Sorry, mailbag.

203
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Okay.

204
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,160
Tonight's show is about thinking of new ideas for the future, isn't our show going to be

205
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
great?

206
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,040
I've been thinking of an amazing podcast since last October, and I think it's amazing.

207
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,200
But anyways, I know you guys play many MMOs, except for maybe Loki.

208
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,640
I was wondering what your thoughts are on crappy MMOs, such as RuneScape, or that's

209
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,040
pretty much the only crappy MMO I've played.

210
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,020
Well, it's not that bad, it's just full of grinding, so I guess the true question of

211
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,880
mine is, what are your thoughts on RuneScape?

212
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
I've never played it.

213
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,400
Also, whenever I see, Let's Have Tea screen name, I always think it says, Let's Shave

214
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Tea.

215
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,360
But that doesn't matter.

216
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
How would you shave tea?

217
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
Tea leaves, maybe you shave them with a razor.

218
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,240
You and your logic.

219
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,440
So keep up the great work, Skydark, Sakura, and Loki, and I can't wait for the next podcast.

220
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,960
And that's from someone who didn't put their name on here.

221
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
So it's from person.

222
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,320
RuneScape, the only thing about it, I'm looking at some articles about it on Wikipedia, it

223
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,880
looks a little dated to me.

224
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,440
I've never played it.

225
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,480
But it's free, and free is always a good thing.

226
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
So it looks like...

227
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,840
No, free is not always a good thing.

228
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,600
I guess that's true, there was Yaris.

229
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Yaris.

230
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
But this looks better than Yaris.

231
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
At least you can customize your equipment.

232
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,680
The characters look kind of funny.

233
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,800
Apparently there's 150 different RuneScape servers throughout the world.

234
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
It started in 2003.

235
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,280
No, no, I might have to check it out, it might be fun.

236
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
It's RuneScape.

237
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,560
Fuck RuneScape.

238
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Why fuck RuneScape?

239
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,040
So you obviously know this game.

240
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,400
What do you think of RuneScape?

241
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,280
You get what you pay for.

242
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,320
Why don't you like it?

243
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,880
It's slow, it's clunky, it's a grindfest, and it has one of the worst communities I've

244
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,160
ever seen in a game, ever.

245
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,800
And it looks like it's set in the universe of Paperboy.

246
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,320
Based on that screenshot it does a little bit, huh?

247
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Paperboy the MMO, that's pretty rad.

248
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,680
That would be awesome, I'd play it.

249
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,600
And then you go to the Crystal Castles and you're done.

250
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Anyway.

251
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Next email!

252
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Okay!

253
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Jeez, Rob, jeez.

254
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Okay.

255
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,400
I like ordering the next email.

256
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,640
I think I'm going to do that from now on, I'm going to order the emails.

257
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,320
Yeah, watch me shove this ferret up your ass.

258
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Ew.

259
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
This comes from...

260
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,560
No, I love the ferret, I wouldn't do that to the ferret.

261
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
Anyway.

262
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
It's a new segment.

263
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
I can't think of an introduction to my email except for holy crap.

264
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,680
I'm a bit scared about what happened to Rob, I hope you feel better, and that it wasn't

265
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,560
anything too serious.

266
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,040
Well, I feel better.

267
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,840
I just, if you want to do something for me, just cross your fingers, cross your toes,

268
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,640
pray if that's what you're into, or what have you, you know, light a candle or something

269
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,740
that it doesn't come back, and that it goes away.

270
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,840
Because honestly, that's the most scary thing about it, is that I still have a little bit

271
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,060
of those pains, and I'm hoping it's just on its way out, but I just don't want to go back

272
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
to the hospital.

273
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,060
This is a scary place.

274
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,060
Don't worry, Rob, we can help you.

275
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,840
We've played plenty of Trauma Center and we know what to do.

276
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,040
Remember, video games teach you about real life and shit, right?

277
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

278
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Anyway.

279
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,080
Oh, hey, it's addressed to me.

280
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,500
Ragnarok Online 2 Gate of the World Private Servers are up.

281
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,560
The one I play on is euphro2.com.

282
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,300
It's e-u-p-h-r-o-2.com.

283
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,840
It runs off Korean beta software and only basic things are translated menus and such.

284
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,700
The soundtrack is also much better than the first Ragnarok.

285
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,360
The game is also completely different from the first as it runs in 3D, and you can change

286
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,640
classes whenever you want as long as your job level is over five, and the game runs

287
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,360
surprisingly a lot like World of Warcraft by interface and battle system.

288
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,760
The private server has two servers, a test that's 100, 100, 100 rate, and a main server,

289
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,200
I don't know what rates, assuming it has rates as their R01 server, 3, 3, 3.

290
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Anyway.

291
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,960
It's from SakuraMax and it says, waiting for something amazing to happen.

292
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm surprised you're not all over Ragnarok 2 if it's out there.

293
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,680
Not until I find a translated copy, like fully translated.

294
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,400
I mean, I'm going to look into this one tonight actually.

295
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,800
Sounds like soon though.

296
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,760
I'm going to look into this one because I'm very interested and I've read up a lot on

297
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,640
Ragnarok 2 already, but I had that, I tried to get into the official beta but I didn't

298
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,560
have a Korean social security number.

299
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,800
By the way, Cheeseburger sent me a private message commenting on RuneScape.

300
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,240
He said, I played one time someone was following me asking me for sex.

301
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,480
Wow.

302
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,320
I should be playing this game.

303
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Sounds like fun.

304
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Just kidding.

305
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Wow.

306
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Anyway.

307
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Can I continue?

308
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Yes.

309
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Next email.

310
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Okay.

311
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Hey, OLR.

312
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,320
I have been listening since episode 245, which I don't know which one that is.

313
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,880
I just wanted to tell you how rad your podcast, your postcast, as it says.

314
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,980
I have laughed so many times listening to you guys and my ears do burn when you mention

315
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,500
anything to do with Australia.

316
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,760
Last year, Loki mentioned a mobile game called The Coolest Girl in School co-created by Champagne

317
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
for the Ladies.

318
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,040
I actually worked next door to Champagne for the Ladies doing freelance game artwork.

319
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Nice.

320
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,760
Loki referred to it as GTA for Girls, LOL.

321
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,440
Keep up the good work, picks ill plays in.

322
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
And this is from Australia.

323
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,480
It's someone from Australia, so that's cool.

324
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm glad we didn't offend all of our Australian listeners when we were, it's like it wasn't

325
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,240
a couple of weeks ago.

326
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,760
We just totally, somebody asked us like what the capital of Australia was, I don't remember

327
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,760
what the hell happened.

328
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,520
You asked me and I didn't know.

329
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
That's right.

330
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Whatever.

331
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
It's not Sydney.

332
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Maybe.

333
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Remember that much.

334
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
It's all right.

335
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
It's all right.

336
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
I don't know my world capitals that well.

337
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
I know Australia, but that's because I'm part Australia.

338
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,360
Yeah, they're sad that there's a two-year-old on YouTube naming off capitals of countries

339
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,560
and all the states in the United States.

340
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,720
Well, you know what?

341
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
He's going to grow up to be a crackler.

342
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
And he's two years old.

343
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Because seriously, where's that knowledge going to get you in life?

344
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,200
Are you smarter than a two-year-old?

345
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Probably not.

346
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Okay.

347
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,920
Hey guys, I was on YouTube last night and saw this video.

348
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Yeah, okay.

349
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,360
It's the movie trailer for the movie The Legend of Zelda.

350
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,400
I know it's fake as you can see by the date at the end, but I wanted to know if this was

351
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,880
made into a movie, would you guys think it would be the most awesome thing in the world

352
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
or epic fail?

353
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
P.S.

354
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,960
When you guys are done doing this show in a really, really long time I hope, can I have

355
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
a ferret on eBay?

356
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
No.

357
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,520
I guess we could eBay the ferret or something.

358
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
I don't know.

359
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,080
This is from Cheeseburger, by the way.

360
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,800
Did Cheeseburger get fooled by the April Fool's joke or did he say?

361
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
He said he realized it was a fake.

362
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
He said it was.

363
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Oh, okay.

364
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I would think they would have to do better.

365
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,160
It wasn't quite epic in its level of failure, but it was, yeah.

366
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,680
I thought it was decent enough that it proves that Zelda can have a movie made out of it

367
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,480
and it doesn't have to suck.

368
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,800
I mean if they actually poured some money into it, it could be Lord of the Rings-ish

369
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,640
epic, but they'd have to put some money and some star power and some writing and all that

370
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,600
good stuff and some special effects into it.

371
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,960
What do you think, Rice Princess, being the big Zelda fan you are, do you think that they

372
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,760
could actually make a movie out of Zelda?

373
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Of course they can.

374
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,320
They can make a movie out of anything.

375
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
I guess that's true.

376
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
They do sometimes.

377
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,320
They're not well, but yeah.

378
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,080
The trailer, like I said, it was okay.

379
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,520
I mean for what it was, an April Fool's joke, it was good.

380
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,560
For a real movie, no, I wouldn't watch it.

381
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Nice.

382
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Yeah.

383
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,280
They should do an animated one.

384
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
It would be cool.

385
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,160
Here's a crazy idea I've always had.

386
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
I think the sci-fi network, you know how they sometimes do those random mini-series like

387
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,280
they did the Wizard of Oz thing not that long ago, and they're kind of low budget, but they're

388
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
decent, right?

389
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,160
Like a Lifetime movie?

390
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
Yeah.

391
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,920
I think they should do like a mini-series adapting one of the Final Fantasy games.

392
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,480
It sure is boring around here.

393
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,840
Now, Squeenix would never ever let them do it, but I don't know, they should.

394
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,640
It would be kind of cool.

395
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,400
The Spirits Within sure as hell wasn't a Final Fantasy movie.

396
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
It was a good movie.

397
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
It just wasn't Final Fantasy.

398
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,760
As this J-100 Matt would like to remind us, they did make a movie out of Good Burger,

399
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,960
so why not a movie for Legend of Zelda?

400
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
That's a good point.

401
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Okay.

402
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,160
I'm going to keep going, all right?

403
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
Yes.

404
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Next email.

405
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
This is from J-Rod.

406
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Hey, guys.

407
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,560
I was just wondering if any of you have heard any news on the TNA Impact game.

408
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,960
I'm a huge wrestling fan, and there are droves of us who have left McMahon's stale product

409
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,000
and have gotten behind TNA.

410
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,600
Needless to say, we were thrilled when we found out there was a TNA game being developed

411
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
by Midway.

412
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,680
Last time I saw anything on it, they had motion capture videos up online, and the release

413
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,600
date was supposed to be sometime in spring.

414
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,640
Well, spring is here, and I haven't seen any press, previews, marketing, or anything about

415
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
it.

416
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,080
Have you guys or anyone in chat heard anything about this game, because I will be really

417
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,640
upset if it gets delayed or canned.

418
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,000
Thanks and keep up the awesome job.

419
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,720
This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.

420
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
June.

421
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,200
It's coming out in June.

422
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Nice.

423
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,680
I don't follow wrestling stuff.

424
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,880
I'll get it if it has a custom mode in it, like a create a wrestler, because it's actually

425
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,600
the only fun thing I like about those games.

426
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
Oh, I didn't know this.

427
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,200
Sagan Chat says in response to my sci-fi network comment earlier, you do know that sci-fi was

428
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,440
in plans to make a Myst miniseries.

429
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,840
I did not know that, but that would be kind of rad.

430
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,400
Myst Online was interesting.

431
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,480
I'm kind of sad to see it go, but it took a lot of manpower to run that game, I think.

432
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
But Myst Online was creepy.

433
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,240
It was one of the creepiest MMOs I've ever played.

434
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,440
It made me think, what if Silent Hill was an MMO?

435
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
It would be like this.

436
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
That would be beautiful.

437
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,280
But then you'd have to take a psychological exam so it could bring up monsters based on

438
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,680
things out of your own psyche.

439
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,720
RocioUT would like to point out that Midway's website also lists the game being Summer 08.

440
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,680
There you have it.

441
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,080
Can I read the next email?

442
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Next email!

443
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,640
It's freaking long, but I'm going to read it anyway.

444
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,480
And this email was sent by DidYouLoseASock.

445
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
No I didn't.

446
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
I didn't either.

447
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
They're in the house.

448
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
I'm not wearing them now.

449
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
I'm barefoot.

450
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I'm naked.

451
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,480
My feet are naked.

452
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Okay.

453
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
Next email.

454
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,600
I went to an advanced private screening of the movie Postal by Uwe Boll based off of

455
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,040
the video game of the same name, easily one of the worst films I have ever seen.

456
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,480
Uwe was at the screening and he was actually cool in real life.

457
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,840
Before showing the film, he talked about the reasons he made it and wanted to make a film

458
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,120
that he would like himself and did not care what critics or other people would think about

459
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,640
it and that's what he got.

460
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,080
He also commented on how the Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler movies are all the same and they

461
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,720
keep making them over and over again.

462
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,120
And about how the film 10,000 BC critics hated it 9% on Rotten Tomatoes, yet it made over

463
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,360
200 million worldwide because of the money put into the advertisements for the movie.

464
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,980
He also talked about how he is not the only one to do poor adaptations and pointed to

465
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,920
the films Electra and Catwoman.

466
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,400
Amen to that.

467
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,480
He talked about a few other problems with films in the film industry.

468
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,760
All the points he made were really great, but this film still sucked in the end.

469
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,800
Every religion and race he made fun of in this film, it was like a live action South

470
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,360
Park with crude humor and morals throughout.

471
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,080
Would the film have actually been good if everything was replaced with South Park characters?

472
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,400
Probably, but then again I think anything would be really funny if it was replaced by

473
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,940
South Park characters.

474
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,400
Is this film worth seeing?

475
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,600
It was so bad that some might find it good.

476
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,040
I might suggest this film over all those stupid spoof movies like Superhero Movie and Meet

477
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
the Spartans.

478
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:45,520
Ewey Bull in the past has boxed critics who would not like his films.

479
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,000
So after the film got over, of course, I did not like it, so I asked him to fake Punch

480
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,040
Me for a Photo, which he did and was a good sport about it.

481
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,600
Where I saw the film was a small private screening room that Ebert and Ripper and other media

482
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,120
people used to view films.

483
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,480
No major reporters were there, only smaller media outlets because of the status of the

484
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
film.

485
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,840
It was an amazing place and better than the film itself.

486
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,840
Spoiler warning!

487
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Should I?

488
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
No one's going to see it.

489
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Yeah, no one's going to see it.

490
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,120
I'm going to see it, but that's fine.

491
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Here's the thing.

492
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,840
Reduce the volume on your iPod for about 15 seconds if you don't want to hear the spoiler.

493
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,920
The only slightly funny part in this film were Ewey Bull plays himself as a stereotypical

494
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,520
German dressed in lederhosen.

495
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,880
In the film he talks about how his films were funded by Nazi gold and then fights the creator

496
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,240
of Postal because he was mad at Ewey for ruining his game.

497
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,240
I give credit to someone who can make fun of themselves, and I think he included the

498
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
picture.

499
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,720
I'm trying to pull it up, but we did.

500
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Nice.

501
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,440
There we go.

502
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
Very nice.

503
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
That's a good picture.

504
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
That's great.

505
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
That's a MySpace photo right there.

506
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,720
Wait, I got punched in the face by Ewey Bull.

507
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,200
Yeah, you should get that on a shirt.

508
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,880
You should actually print that on a shirt and say, I got punched in the face by Ewey

509
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Bull.

510
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
Email.

511
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Hold on real quick.

512
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,120
I got to say this comment from Black Wolf.

513
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,240
Black Wolf says, did you lose the sock in charity?

514
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,560
He's in chat, so have him link the photo.

515
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,280
Black Wolf says this, Ewey Bull stated in an interview that he knows about the petition

516
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
to get him to stop doing anything in movies.

517
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,800
It has 18,000 signatures.

518
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,120
He says that's not enough.

519
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,980
He says he'll consider leaving the industry if that petition gets one million signatures.

520
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,360
So what is more important, Loki as Tingle or Ewey Bull not in the film industry anymore?

521
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,880
You have a better chance of getting him to leave the film industry than me to dress up

522
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
as Tingle.

523
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Oh, snap.

524
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,800
Because at least signatures don't cost anything.

525
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,080
That's true.

526
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,600
True that.

527
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Last email.

528
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Last email.

529
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Hi, OLR.

530
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,240
I'm a loyal podcast listener and wanted to tell you how much I like your show.

531
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Well, thank you.

532
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,880
Your show makes me happy and Loki's runs always make me laugh.

533
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,440
In fact, you guys make me laugh so much that I've gotten used to awkward steers in public.

534
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,760
Thanks for making such a great show and please keep it up.

535
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,800
This is from Able to Think.

536
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
There's more.

537
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
P.S.

538
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,120
Dark Sakura, I know how much you love treasure, so I thought I'd let you know that the bleach

539
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,480
fighting game on DS is made by them.

540
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Ooh.

541
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
P.P.S.

542
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
An interesting question.

543
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,940
I'd like to hear your answers.

544
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,920
A woman while at the funeral of her mother met a man who she did not know.

545
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,280
She thought he was amazing.

546
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,720
She believed him to be her dream partner so much that she fell in love with him right

547
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,160
then and there but never asked for his phone number or address and could not find him after

548
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
the funeral.

549
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,540
A few days later, she killed her sister.

550
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,600
So the question.

551
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,480
What was the woman's motive for killing her sister?

552
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,680
Now think about it.

553
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,480
Why would you think that she would kill her sister?

554
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
I don't know.

555
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
Do I care?

556
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Anybody?

557
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,000
Dr. Phil made her do it.

558
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm sorry.

559
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,240
I wasn't listening.

560
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,040
So she can see the guy again?

561
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Okay.

562
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
Answer.

563
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,040
She was hoping the man would appear again at her sister's funeral.

564
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,200
If you answer this correctly, you think like a psychopath.

565
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,840
Oh, I've heard that thing before.

566
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,880
This was a test used by a famous American psychologist to test if someone has the same

567
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,440
mentality as a killer.

568
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,360
Several incarcerated serial killers took part in the test and all answered the question

569
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
correctly.

570
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,600
If you didn't answer the question correctly, good for you.

571
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,880
If you gave the correct answer, please let me know so I can keep an eye on you.

572
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,040
And then like when they're interviewing someone, so what was the motive?

573
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
I don't know.

574
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,340
And then they stabbed him in the face.

575
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,800
Let me tell you about my mother.

576
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,280
Or you could just be good at logical deduction.

577
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,880
You don't have to think like a psychopath.

578
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,080
You can just think it out.

579
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
That was the last email, right?

580
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
Yes.

581
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,520
That was the last email.

582
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,880
By the way, kids, we have a list list coming up tonight.

583
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,000
Things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

584
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,440
I need everybody in studio to do a list of three things.

585
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,480
But there's too many, we only can only do five.

586
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Yeah, I figured that much.

587
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,240
So Irene and Nathan, you guys can combine a list.

588
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,400
So think a list of three things, things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

589
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,840
Does anybody need cards to write things down?

590
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
Because I have little cards.

591
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Yes.

592
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
I would like a card, Rob.

593
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Here you go.

594
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Here's a card.

595
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
Here you go.

596
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Thank you very much.

597
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,840
There you go.

598
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
Do you have a pen or a pencil?

599
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
You can borrow mine, but you've got to give them both.

600
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Oh, we have a pencil.

601
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
Okay, good.

602
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Never mind.

603
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
But thank you very much, Rob.

604
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
This is great radio, by the way.

605
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
I know.

606
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,840
I'm trying to fill time.

607
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
Back to the news, please.

608
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
All right.

609
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,360
I was going to say this is finally launched, but guess what?

610
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,720
N-Gage is back, bitches.

611
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
That's right.

612
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,360
The N-Gage application has finally launched.

613
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:46,320
And it is compatible with Nokia's N81, N81 8 gigabyte, N82, N95, N95 8 gigabyte phones.

614
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,840
And there are five games right now currently available for it, Brain Challenge, System

615
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,560
Rush Evolution, and World Series of Poker, and I guess two other ones.

616
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,000
And then all the other games, or all the games it gets offered free trials, and then can

617
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,080
be purchased straight from a computer once you create an N-Gage account.

618
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,880
And some new games coming at some point, Worms World Party, and Sims 2 Pets, and of course

619
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,040
Tetris.

620
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,440
I don't know.

621
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,320
I guess that's kind of neat.

622
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Maybe?

623
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
No?

624
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Chirp, chirp.

625
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
Chirp, chirp.

626
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,040
I mean, it is the N-Gage.

627
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Quick poll.

628
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,920
We're going to do a quick poll in chat right now, okay?

629
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,880
I just want you guys to answer with yes or no.

630
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,960
Do you care about the N-Gage?

631
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,200
Chat room, answer now.

632
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
No.

633
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
We'll do this next story.

634
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Do you care about the N-Gage?

635
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
That is the whole chat room.

636
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
All right, let's see.

637
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Spoken on behalf of them.

638
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,320
I'm just going to see while I read this next story.

639
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,040
This is something people might care about.

640
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,520
Saints Row 2 is coming out on August 26th.

641
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,080
Are you excited about this, Loki?

642
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Fuck yeah.

643
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,980
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

644
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,560
This was announced at the THQ Gamer's Day, which was in San Francisco earlier this week.

645
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
We get invited to those fuckers.

646
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,120
Yeah, we never do.

647
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,680
There is a Saints Row 2 website now up and running.

648
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,520
It's at saintsrow.com.

649
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,220
Not saintsrow2.com, it's saintsrow.com.

650
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:16,640
And the timing of it is between Grand Theft Auto IV and Christmas, so it's a pretty good

651
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
time.

652
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,400
We have it, Saints Row 2, August 26th, which is about two years after the game originally

653
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
came out, I think.

654
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Loki is probably already pre-ordered.

655
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,440
I will be buying this for sure, which is kind of cool, though.

656
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,080
They have a whole set of trailers that they're starting to run.

657
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,740
I know you can view them on IGN and probably some other places, with Uncle Gary talking

658
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,360
about different aspects of the game that are new to Saints Row 2.

659
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,540
And of course, for those who aren't aware, Uncle Gary is Gary Busey, so it is pretty

660
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,680
funny.

661
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,800
But there are some new things, especially if you've been reading any of the previews

662
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,040
on there.

663
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,440
There's sticky satchel charges that you can throw on people and detonate them remotely,

664
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,800
and then you can actually throw people in this game.

665
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:07,120
And there's different taunts you can do, including, I believe you can teabag someone in this game.

666
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Lovely.

667
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,680
Here's the results of our quick poll.

668
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,280
Do you care about the engage?

669
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
Here we go.

670
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
No.

671
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
No.

672
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
No.

673
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
No.

674
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
No.

675
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
No.

676
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
No.

677
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
No.

678
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
No.

679
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
No.

680
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
No.

681
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
No.

682
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
No.

683
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
No.

684
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
No Industry.

685
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
No.

686
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
No.

687
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
Yes.

688
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Kinda.

689
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Yes.

690
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
No.

691
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,280
No.

692
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
The what?

693
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
Yes, it's a no.

694
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
No.

695
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
No.

696
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
No.

697
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
Uh, blackwolf clarifies his kindness, saying, Some of the games I saw for the new Engage

698
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,360
platform had some neat ideas.

699
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,760
So kinda.

700
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,420
And lastly as Mae Satsuma says, the only N-Gage I care about was the one from Star Trek The

701
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
Next Generation.

702
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
No, God, why?

703
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
You love that joke, right?

704
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,760
Chat comment of the night, I love it.

705
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
That's my favorite.

706
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
You win.

707
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,800
So there you have it.

708
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
The results of the quick poll.

709
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,880
I answered the poll, too.

710
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,200
Live radio is awesome.

711
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Yes, it is.

712
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,560
What did you say, Dark Sagra?

713
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
Pod may know.

714
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,000
All right, look.

715
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,120
Story please, Dark Sagra.

716
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,520
OK, OK, OK.

717
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,360
Oh yeah, it would help if I actually could find it.

718
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
OK, there we go.

719
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,960
Gran Turismo PSP, who cares?

720
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,840
OK, some people do.

721
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:33,240
It's actually delayed until 2009, yeah.

722
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,600
It should be noted that it's actually called Duke Nukem Forever's Gran Turismo for the

723
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,360
PSP.

724
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,840
I call it, you know, you've got prologue, I guess?

725
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
Doesn't matter.

726
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,240
Yeah, it's funny, though, because they were showing this thing off, like, I want to see

727
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
before the PSP came out.

728
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,160
Wasn't it one of the things that they were saying, hey, yeah, it's going to be so awesome.

729
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,280
Yeah, I thought they were talking about Ridge Racer, though.

730
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Didn't happen.

731
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,820
Oh, well, so sad.

732
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:15,200
So something that may happen, it's interesting, actually, apparently we're not the only people

733
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:22,800
out there that sent out stories that later retracted, IGN had some interesting stuff.

734
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,440
It happens to the best of us.

735
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,040
IGN had a few things.

736
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:33,080
First, their story about a game called Skate It coming out for the DS and the Wii, that's

737
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,000
right, that's a version of the game put out by EA that will be coming to the Nintendo

738
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,280
platforms.

739
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:48,040
No word on when exactly it will be coming out, of course, the information was very brief,

740
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:55,640
but they did say that, you know, they were talking about using, of course, the Wii remote

741
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,520
motion control for the game and stuff like that, but then later, they retracted that

742
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,280
and actually pulled the entire story.

743
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:10,560
But thanks to the magic of Google cache, you can actually still view that article.

744
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,280
And you know what's better than spoiling one game?

745
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:20,920
Spoiling two games, because IGN did the same damn thing with an upcoming Batman game.

746
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,900
The story was pulled.

747
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,720
There was not a lot of details on the game, it was pretty much, I guess, just a generic

748
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,260
kind of blank page that just indicated there was a Batman game coming, but, you know, you

749
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:39,400
could probably put two and two together and figure that it was a Dark Knight adaptation.

750
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,840
And keep in mind, Pandemic is the company that made Destroy All Humans and Mercenaries

751
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,120
and Pandemic was the company that was slated to make this Batman game.

752
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
So what do you think of that?

753
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,960
The folks making Destroy All Humans and making Batman?

754
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,000
It could be okay, Destroy All Humans has kind of been lost its edge since, like, the first

755
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,560
games lost its edge, but Mercenaries 2 looks fucking awesome.

756
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,440
I had a friend that worked on that.

757
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,200
It's interesting though, here's what they had, actually someone had copied this from

758
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:16,720
the Neo GAF forums, it said, never one to turn down a good movie tie-in, by the way,

759
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,920
of a brand new video game.

760
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:23,520
IGN has learned that EA has indeed tapped Pandemic to create a new Batman title.

761
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:29,420
We first reported this as a strong rumor back in May of 2007, but now we know it's happening

762
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
for sure.

763
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,520
Elevation Partners, who were owners of Pandemic and BioWare until the EA purchase had gained

764
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,920
the video game rights to the franchise, we rumored last year that EA would publish the

765
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,320
title, but now EA owns the aforementioned companies and the publishing aspect was a

766
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
given.

767
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,640
Unfortunately we don't have any specific platform, a release date, or even an official title,

768
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,080
but given EA's history, we'd expect a game to be called The Dark Knight released this

769
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,920
July alongside the film, and to hit just about every platform known to humankind.

770
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,940
I can tell you right now it's probably not coming out in July, but as you say it seems

771
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,140
a bit late, but if they are developing something like that, it could also come out around the

772
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,320
release of the movie on DVD.

773
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,360
That's what I'm thinking, more DVD Blu-ray time.

774
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,280
Which would be around the fourth quarter I'd imagine.

775
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Probably Christmas.

776
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,960
But I don't even know if that would make it in time, if it's not in development.

777
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,600
I'm curious to see how they would tastefully handle the whole Heath Ledger thing.

778
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:30,660
Well, EA actually did the last Batman game I think, so it makes sense.

779
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,600
Some of the Batman games really kick ass, like the old school Batman on the NES was

780
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
one of the best games.

781
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Oh that was fun.

782
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
That was one of the best games on the NES.

783
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Heck yeah.

784
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,040
Batman Returns was kind of wonky.

785
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,360
I didn't play it.

786
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,080
First Batman was pretty awesome.

787
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Yeah.

788
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
So.

789
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
Again.

790
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,600
There are good movie adaptation games once in a great, great while.

791
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Okay.

792
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
List list coming up.

793
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
I hope you guys have your list soon.

794
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,120
It's coming right up after one more story, which is Jamie's story.

795
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,720
Yes it is.

796
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,440
Samsung is bringing different games out for their smartphones and one of them is Second

797
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,320
Life.

798
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:15,040
So basically they're actually showing it, the CTIA wireless thing that was going on

799
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:22,700
where you can access it using the smartphones and, you know, talk through a text in SMS.

800
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:28,440
So it said that they want to launch it in the second half of this year.

801
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,600
All righty.

802
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,640
It's going to be interesting though if you can have that crack with you where it's Furries

803
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,080
Portable is what it is.

804
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Right Drew?

805
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Furries Portable.

806
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
All right.

807
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
Okay.

808
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,880
Here's the deal guys.

809
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,280
We're going to play a little game.

810
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,920
We have been playing since our first couple episodes here on Live 365 right on down to

811
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,240
the very last episode on Live 365.

812
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:59,440
It's a segment we call Listless.

813
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,800
Tonight's Listless.

814
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,540
The topic is things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

815
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,000
It's been a little while since we've done Listless.

816
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,520
It's at least been a few months.

817
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,800
Some of our games only show up once every few months.

818
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Here's the deal.

819
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,680
This is that we're going to go around the room and each person is going to name their

820
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,600
top three, one at a time, things that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

821
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,680
Is everybody done with their list?

822
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,480
If anyone is still in need of suggestions, chat room, you can try to influence us now.

823
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,040
If you have a good idea for things Live 365 could do to get us to stay, start posting

824
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,200
those suggestions in chat now and maybe a host or a guest will pick up on it.

825
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,520
But then after the list is made, so we'll get a big list that has one, two, three, four,

826
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,480
and fifteen things on it, then we're going to go around and we each take one thing off

827
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
the list.

828
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,240
We vote something off the list.

829
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,360
It's off the island, okay?

830
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
No more.

831
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,640
So it's off the list and then the chat room will take that list of ten and vote on their

832
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,200
favorite and we will come up with a definitive list of things Live 365 could do to get us

833
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
to stay.

834
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,520
Participating tonight, DarkSakura, myself, Loki, Drew, and so that we don't have too

835
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,440
many people, Bryce Princess and SilentNathan, I think it's going to be his new name, Silent

836
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,280
Bob, SilentNathan, are going to be combined as one person because they're a couple and

837
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
you can do that to couples.

838
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Oh my God, that's so cute.

839
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,200
Aw, what do you think of that, SilentNathan?

840
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
That's what I thought.

841
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
All right.

842
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,720
I'm just giving him a hard time.

843
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,040
It's because his girlfriend hogs the mic.

844
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
All right.

845
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
What do you mean?

846
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
I don't hog the mic.

847
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
You shut up now.

848
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,280
All right, here we go.

849
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,540
Let's start off the list.

850
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,560
We'll start tonight with Drew.

851
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,280
What is your number three thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay?

852
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,080
Ferret radio, all ferret all the time.

853
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,160
All ferret radio, all ferret all the time.

854
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,800
I don't know if I've ever fucking listened to that, but it might work.

855
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:02,520
All right, all ferret radio, Bryce Princess and SilentNathan, your number three pick.

856
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:09,280
Provide the studio via Irene a unicorn.

857
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,000
Provide the studio a unicorn via Irene.

858
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,840
Oh, that's the important part of House of Beatle and Yuck.

859
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
I like that idea.

860
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
Me too.

861
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
I think a unicorn would be fun.

862
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
It would be great.

863
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
I think that would give me a stay.

864
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:26,160
I'd stay with Live 365 if they gave me a unicorn and leave like six months later, but you know.

865
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,160
What do you have, the unicorn?

866
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,600
Do I have to feed it?

867
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,080
I hope they provide food too.

868
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,400
I'm pretty sure unicorns are like self-sufficient because they're like magical and shit.

869
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Unicorns eat children.

870
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Yeah, see?

871
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
We've got millions of them here.

872
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,480
All right, let's see what happens.

873
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,800
I'm just curious what Bobby Blackwolf thinks of this whole segment.

874
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,920
I'm seeing if he suggested anything because, you know, it could change.

875
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,000
We may have to pull out of the deal if Live 365 is able to provide a unicorn, we might

876
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
have to pull out.

877
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Well, let's see what some of the other things are on the list.

878
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,320
Dark Soccer, we'll go to you next.

879
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,720
Number three, your number three pick.

880
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,520
Pay for me to relocate to England.

881
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
Just you?

882
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Yes.

883
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,600
Okay, me and the people of my choice.

884
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:20,640
Okay, sorry, I am slow.

885
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,920
I'm typing as we do this here, so it takes me a minute.

886
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,520
All right, sorry, filler.

887
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Thank you.

888
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Irene, sing.

889
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,040
When we need little filler, you need to sing, okay?

890
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
I can dance, I can sing.

891
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,040
Well, that's why we have the theme music too, so there's something to listen to.

892
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,200
Me, your number three pick.

893
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,240
I would like Ken Kutaragi's heart on a platter.

894
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Kalima!

895
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Kalima!

896
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,800
I'm sorry, we can't do that.

897
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
We're out of platters.

898
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
That's sick.

899
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
You're sick.

900
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,120
I bet you got that serial killer question right.

901
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,920
Ken Kutaragi's heart on a platter.

902
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Oh, God.

903
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
Lawsuit in the air.

904
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
All right, sue Live 365.

905
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Don't sue us.

906
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
All right.

907
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Obviously, he's joking.

908
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
All right.

909
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:11,560
Oh, I love what the chat room suggests.

910
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,480
I'm going to read that later after what we get here.

911
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,480
All right.

912
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
My number three thing.

913
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
Here it is.

914
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,280
The number three thing Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

915
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,040
Force compile to reform and make a sequel to the guardian legend.

916
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,520
Yes.

917
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,000
Dot com.

918
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,720
If Live 365 wants us to stay, they will force compile to get back together and make a sequel

919
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
to the guardian legend.

920
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
I don't know.

921
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
At gunpoint.

922
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
However, they have to do it.

923
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
But that's the only way we're staying.

924
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
All right.

925
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Here we go.

926
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,120
The number two way that Live 365 can get us to stay.

927
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,520
We'll start with Drew.

928
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,680
Make tuner software that doesn't suck.

929
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,720
Make tuner software that doesn't suck.

930
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,240
Radio 365, I'm looking at you.

931
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,920
Why do you think that I was using the Sam 2 broadcaster?

932
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,920
All right.

933
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Nice.

934
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,960
Irene and Silent Nathan, what is the number three, I'm sorry, number two thing that Live

935
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,080
365 could do to get us to stay?

936
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,960
Blow jobs for everyone.

937
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,640
That was my number one answer.

938
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,280
My number one was blow me.

939
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,160
Now I'm going to have to change that you asshole.

940
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
That's okay.

941
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
I'm stealing a great one from Chet.

942
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
All right.

943
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
Let's see.

944
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,000
Dark Sakura, you're number two.

945
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:45,120
My number two, that would be to pay me $100,000 a year to do Warren Jones radio.

946
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
That's a nice salary.

947
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,120
By me, I mean us each.

948
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
Okay.

949
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,120
Us each.

950
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Pay $100,000 a year.

951
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,120
And guests get like $5,000 a visit.

952
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
An appearance.

953
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
All right.

954
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
They get to touch us.

955
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
They get royalties.

956
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,120
All right.

957
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,760
That's actually your number two thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

958
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,640
I was going to say, give me the motherfucking movie check, but because we didn't do a movie,

959
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
motherfucking radio check.

960
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,560
I guess that kind of is the same thing as what she said.

961
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
Is that a reference?

962
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
All right.

963
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
Here's mine.

964
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,560
Here's mine.

965
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,560
Okay.

966
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Pay us $200,000 a year to do Orson Trejo.

967
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,560
That was actually my original number three.

968
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
I'm serious.

969
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
Lovely.

970
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
All right.

971
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,800
Pay $200,000 a year to do Orson Trejo immediately followed by pay $200,000 a year to do Orson

972
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Trejo.

973
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,800
Beautiful.

974
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,640
Number two thing from my list that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

975
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,640
Heal my pancreas.

976
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,040
They could do that with a unicorn.

977
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,960
We need to play you the Weird Al song over and over and over again until your pancreas

978
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,320
go, okay, fine.

979
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Heal my pancreas.

980
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,320
The number two thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

981
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:00,400
All right, yeah, Dark Sakura, heal please.

982
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
Bite my ass, please.

983
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
I'm in battle, dammit.

984
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Here we go.

985
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,720
It's down to the number ones on our list.

986
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,120
Drew, your number one thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

987
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,680
Give Jamie a cookie.

988
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,160
Ooh, I like cookies.

989
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Give Jamie a cookie.

990
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,200
How about give Jamie pastrami?

991
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,840
I like pastrami better.

992
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
All right.

993
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,840
Oh, give Jamie a pastrami cookie.

994
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:29,080
All right, Rice Princess and Silent Nathan, did you come to a consensus?

995
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,280
What is your number one thing that Live 365 could do to get you to stay?

996
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,400
This is a complete consensus between me and Irene.

997
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:44,960
Go back in time and make Rob not retarded so that he'll vote for Chrono Trigger.

998
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,160
Referencing tonight's bonus segment, we were talking about OLR March Madness just so the

999
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,960
podcast listeners know, I cast the deciding vote between Super Metroid and Chrono Trigger.

1000
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,000
So all right, I have to shorten that though for the sake of pencil space to make Rob vote

1001
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
for Chrono Trigger.

1002
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
No, you don't.

1003
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
No, no, no.

1004
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You can type that all out, Rob.

1005
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,200
You leave that intact, Mr. Rob.

1006
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Hold on.

1007
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
You better sing.

1008
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:23,840
All right, good enough, I put go back in time and make Rob not retarded and vote for Chrono

1009
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
Trigger.

1010
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,560
All right, Dark Sakura, your number one thing on the list.

1011
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,600
Not a damn thing they've done fucked up.

1012
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,080
Good answer.

1013
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,300
I think that's our winner right there.

1014
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,520
Not a damn thing they've done fucked up.

1015
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,960
That's Dark Sakura's number one answer.

1016
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,000
Loki, your number one answer.

1017
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,720
I was going to go with George Fore and the Full Cow Grilling Machine.

1018
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,440
Oh, you mean the PS3?

1019
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,440
This isn't my choice.

1020
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,600
I'm sure this is for the chat room because I sure as hell wouldn't want to see this happen,

1021
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:04,880
but purchase one million copies of the Eye of Judgment.

1022
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,680
Somebody check this man for a fever.

1023
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
God damn it.

1024
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,080
I was going to steal, you ass.

1025
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,240
All right, then put in George Fore and Full Cow Grilling Machine.

1026
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,520
No, it's too late.

1027
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,760
You said purchase one million copies of Eye of Judgment is Loki's number one.

1028
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,040
All right, so if Life is Five purchases one million copies of Eye of Judgment, then we'll

1029
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,560
stay and we'll have much LOL with it.

1030
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,980
All right, my number one, my number one would be the thing that Life is Five could do to

1031
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,980
get us to stay.

1032
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,480
Buy us a George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine.

1033
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:47,680
There you go.

1034
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,080
If you might remember, I think the last time we did this was for the Consumer Electronics

1035
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,640
Show, Things We Most Want to See at Consumer Electronics Show.

1036
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,960
One of the answers was buy us a George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine that actually grills

1037
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,400
the entire cow.

1038
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
I don't know if that one.

1039
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Buy us a George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine that actually grills the entire cow

1040
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
and cures the leather.

1041
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,360
All right, here it is, the list of 15 as it is so far.

1042
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,320
All Ferret Radio, provide a unicorn via Irene, pay for dark soccer and the people of her

1043
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,600
choice to go to England, Ken Kutaragi's heart on a platter, force a sequel to the guardian

1044
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:30,200
legend, make tuner software that doesn't suck, blow jobs for everyone, pay $100,000 a year

1045
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:39,600
to do OLR, pay $200,000 a year to do OLR, heal Rob's pancreas, gift Jamie a cookie,

1046
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,800
go back in time and make Rob not retarded and vote for Chrono Trigger, not a damn thing,

1047
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:50,040
they done fucked up, purchase 1 million copies of Eye of Judgment and buy us a George Foreman

1048
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,440
Full Cow Grilling Machine.

1049
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,080
Damn it, this is hard.

1050
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,040
This is a good list.

1051
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,600
I thought this would be kind of a dumb segment tonight, but we did a good job.

1052
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,040
Do you really have to remove some?

1053
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,680
That's the game, I'm sorry to say.

1054
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,880
All right, we're going to go the same way.

1055
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,120
Drunami, we'll start with you, which one of these items is not worthy of the list?

1056
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,800
The $100,000 a year.

1057
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,320
I knew someone had to do that.

1058
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,800
Pay $100,000 a year to do OLR is off the list.

1059
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,840
All right, Rice Princess and Silent Nathan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1060
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,600
Pay $200,000 a year.

1061
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,240
Damn, throw the baby out with a bath water, there they go.

1062
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,920
It's not like money or something.

1063
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,200
I put it in there that's paying $5,000 each minute.

1064
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,720
Nathan's more interested in blowjobs for everyone, all right?

1065
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
All right, who's next?

1066
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,400
Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1067
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
All Ferret Radio.

1068
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
All Ferret Radio.

1069
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
Because we have that anyway.

1070
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,400
Fucking mommy.

1071
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,440
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1072
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,800
I know this is going to sound weird, but blowjobs for everyone, because who knows who's giving

1073
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,800
those blowjobs?

1074
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,800
That could be some scary shit.

1075
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,640
Yeah, have you ever watched Cat House Girls?

1076
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,640
No.

1077
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,240
This could be some scary stuff.

1078
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,040
It could be Air Force, Amy.

1079
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,800
All right, my turn.

1080
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,160
We have Provide a Unicorn, Pay for Dark Sakura to go to England, Ken Kuroi, He's Hard on

1081
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,680
a Platter, Force the Sequel to Guardian Legend, Make Tuner Software Doesn't Suck, Heal Rob's

1082
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,680
Pancreas, Give Jamie a Cookie, Go Back in Time, Make Me Vote for Chrono Trigger, Not

1083
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,040
a Damn Thing, Purchase One Many Copies of Eye Judgment, and Buy Us George Foreman Full

1084
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:32,400
Cow Girly Machine, the one I deem not worthy of the list, Ken Kudaragi's Heart on a Platter,

1085
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,640
because that's kind of sick.

1086
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,600
Here is the list that you in chat can vote for.

1087
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:47,400
You're going to send me, Sky, a private message in chat with your top two in order.

1088
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,680
It's important because your first pick actually gets two votes, okay?

1089
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:58,000
Here is the list as it stands, and I'm about to paste a big thing into chat, so brace yourselves.

1090
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,440
Here we go.

1091
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,440
As Rob gets kicked from chat.

1092
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,520
No, I won't get kicked from chat, okay?

1093
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,520
Here we go.

1094
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,120
Here is the list as it stands.

1095
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,480
Provide a Unicorn via Irene, Pay for Dark Sakura and the people of her choice to go

1096
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,920
to England, Force the Sequel to the Guardian Legend, Make Tuner Software That Doesn't Suck,

1097
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:26,440
Deal Rob's Pancreas, Give Jamie a Cookie, Go Back in Time and Make Rob Not Retarded

1098
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,040
and Vote for Chrono Trigger, Not a Damn Thing, They've Done Fucked Up, Purchase One Million

1099
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,840
Copies of the Eye of Judgment and Buy Us a George Foreman Full Cow Girly Machine.

1100
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,280
It is time to vote and make our list.

1101
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,540
Remember, two votes.

1102
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,540
Private message to Sky.

1103
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,920
We'll have the answers just before tonight's edition of Ask Orange Lounge, which is our

1104
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,720
substitute for the Skype line tonight.

1105
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:55,040
In the meantime, more stories and I will start it off with a little story about Pinball FX.

1106
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,280
And Jamie did touch on this a little bit earlier in part A, but there is a Rocky and Boinkle

1107
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,400
table on the way to Pinball FX.

1108
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,360
It's going to cost you 200 Microsoft points and apparently it is available now.

1109
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,480
I'm going to have to get it.

1110
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,840
Here's the thing though, it is not the Data East original.

1111
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,200
That's why I have to get it.

1112
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,960
So it is apparently though not too shabby.

1113
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,800
It's got ramps, mini games, and it is a Rocky and Boinkle game.

1114
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,760
You get Boris, Natasha, Moose and Squirrel.

1115
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,100
You get it all.

1116
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,100
It's all right there.

1117
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,000
So that came out on April 3rd.

1118
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,600
So I didn't even realize that it had come out this week, but that was one of the days

1119
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,600
I was in the hospital.

1120
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,600
So I must have missed it.

1121
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,600
Wait.

1122
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,840
So do you get all the Mr. Peabody and stuff too?

1123
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,840
Yes.

1124
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,840
Mr. Peabody, Sherman.

1125
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,840
They're all in there.

1126
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
Really?

1127
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,400
I have to tell you a bit of trivia though about the Data East machine.

1128
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,960
The picture of the Wayback machine, right next to it is the DeLorean from Back to the

1129
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,040
Future on the play field.

1130
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,040
Awesome.

1131
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,040
Nice.

1132
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,040
All right.

1133
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,040
I'm going to have to check that out.

1134
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,280
I didn't realize that had come out, but I do have Pinball FX and I would like some more

1135
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,280
tables for it.

1136
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,480
So I'm definitely going to check that out.

1137
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,800
So I'm glad we do this show because I missed a lot of gaming news while I was out.

1138
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,800
All right.

1139
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Let's move on with the gaming news.

1140
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,800
We are tallying some votes.

1141
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,200
Oh, that would be my turn, wouldn't it?

1142
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,680
I think so.

1143
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:22,600
Well, there is a talk about a game called Velociraptor Safari coming out to the iPhone.

1144
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,980
And you know what?

1145
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:28,740
As much as I appreciate iPhone gaming and what they're doing with it, I don't think

1146
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,680
I would find it in my heart to play Velociraptor Safari.

1147
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,680
Fuck that shit.

1148
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,680
Bring us Jambo Safari.

1149
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,680
Bring us Jambo Safari.

1150
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,840
You haven't played Velociraptor Safari then?

1151
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
It's fun.

1152
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,840
Is it?

1153
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,840
How fun is it?

1154
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,840
Do you get to kill them?

1155
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,840
Yes.

1156
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,840
You have a giant spiky chain.

1157
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,840
I will kill a Velociraptor.

1158
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,320
You have a spiky chain that you catch the Velociraptor with and you have to pull them

1159
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,640
through a portal type thing.

1160
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,040
This is like Jambo Safari with Velociraptors.

1161
00:51:54,040 --> 00:52:00,140
It's actually, it's a web game, of course, and what they did is made the client compatible

1162
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,140
with the iPhone.

1163
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,140
This is flasher as hell.

1164
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,080
No cost to you, which is awesome.

1165
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,360
Well, maybe I'll have to give it a go.

1166
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,360
Maybe.

1167
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,360
I don't know.

1168
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,920
I'm too busy listening to American Idol on YouTube.

1169
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:22,320
Well, there is some new developments now in the world of PS3 piracy.

1170
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,680
Unfortunately, there is now a PS3 backup launcher.

1171
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,480
The problem is though, it's still in alpha and it only works on PS3 dev stations, but

1172
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,240
what it allows you to do is boot PS3 games from the hard drive, boot games from a DVD

1173
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:45,200
or Blu-ray disc drive, copy original PS3 games from said optical drive to the hard drive,

1174
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,040
and patch executables on some games to run from the hard drive.

1175
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:55,680
So I don't know, it's a matter of time, I guess, before this becomes as vulnerable as

1176
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,720
say the PSP, which isn't good.

1177
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:04,560
But I can imagine though that a lot of people probably wouldn't want to copy a 50 gig game

1178
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,240
to their hard drive.

1179
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
That would probably suck.

1180
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,240
All right.

1181
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:13,440
Sorry, I'm in the middle of tallying votes.

1182
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,840
We had a lot of votes tonight, by the way.

1183
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,940
If you want to vote, this is your last chance to vote in tonight's list list, things Live

1184
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,840
365 could do to get us to stay.

1185
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,040
One more story before we get to some last minute stories.

1186
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,600
I figured this would be an appropriate story since OLR is always dedicated to giving you

1187
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:37,540
the current in gaming news and staying on top of what's going on in the scene.

1188
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,480
There are new prototypes for the Atari 7800.

1189
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,140
That's right.

1190
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,440
You can actually download them, the ROMs, you can get them at Atariage.com.

1191
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,140
There's a game called Sirius.

1192
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,460
It's a side scrolling shooter that's kind of like R-Type and Gradius.

1193
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,360
For the 7800, it's not bad.

1194
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,960
Plutos is a vertically scrolling shooter, it's not quite as ambitious as Sirius according

1195
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,920
to the poster at LostLevels.org where this is found, but it's still not bad, and Rampart,

1196
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:11,120
which apparently is some type of port of the arcade game that I quite enjoyed Rampart back

1197
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,120
when...

1198
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,120
Yeah, remember that game?

1199
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,880
They ported it to a lot of systems.

1200
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,920
Apparently there was a prototype for the 7800 that never quite got off the ground.

1201
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,920
So there you have it.

1202
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,940
I actually have a couple 5200 prototypes.

1203
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,640
Like actual cartridges or just ROMs?

1204
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,720
Well, the remakes like that that they did.

1205
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,800
I have a couple of them.

1206
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,280
I always wanted to pick up one of those flashback consoles.

1207
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,280
I think they're kind of fun.

1208
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,600
I might still pick one up, but they don't have Activision games in there, do they?

1209
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,840
I'm going to get made fun of by Irene for this, but I don't care.

1210
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,720
I think they have an Activision one.

1211
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:47,260
My favorite Atari 2600 game of all time, next, well, there's two, is Pitfall 2 is the first,

1212
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,260
but the other one is Kaboom.

1213
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,280
Why would I make fun of you?

1214
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,220
You should make fun of me for everything.

1215
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,880
If it was Burger Time, then I would laugh.

1216
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,680
I do love Burger Time, but not quite as much as Kaboom.

1217
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,200
All right, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

1218
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,560
I hope you do, because I still got votes to tally, so we're going to get into the last

1219
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,560
minute stories right now.

1220
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,160
Then we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge tonight, a special Skype segment.

1221
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,000
Yes, as actually, well, we touched on it a little bit earlier, yeah, One Million Signatures

1222
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,520
and Oovil's Career, hooray.

1223
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:19,720
Somebody for some reason, I don't know why, but there's a picture on Xbox 360 fanboy of

1224
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:28,280
a Master Chief My Little Pony that someone made, and it's kind of weird looking.

1225
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,280
That creeps me out.

1226
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,280
Gives me nightmares.

1227
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,740
It's very creepy.

1228
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:39,240
There's also some videos on Xbox 360 fanboy of the new download content for Burnout Paradise,

1229
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:45,440
actually, and that's also available on the developer's website, CriterionGames.com.

1230
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,600
They have a thing on there for that.

1231
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:54,800
Let's see here, there's also, this was another one of the April Fool's jokes that was out

1232
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:02,760
there, Super Pee Pee Brothers, it was from ThinkGeek.com, they did the thing that the

1233
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,000
Wii remote would kind of fit into this, almost like a jockstrap or panty thing that you would

1234
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,960
put on, and some strap-on thing and you would pee into toilets, so that's kind of funny.

1235
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:21,240
And then, GamesRadar.com has a list of the top counterfeit games, those are like the

1236
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:26,880
independent sequels, prequels, custom games, etc.

1237
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:34,520
On the list, Halo Zero, which was a side-scrolling version of Halo that someone created that

1238
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:41,160
looks pretty cool, they also had some other stuff, Black Mesa, which I think is a remake

1239
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:49,040
of Half-Life 1 and the Half-Life 2 engine, and there was also a Sonic game, Super Mario

1240
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:55,040
Brothers Revenge of Bowser, that looks pretty neat, kind of in the style of, what is it,

1241
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:02,440
looks like, not Lost Levels, I don't remember, yeah, Mario 3, and then they also have Paper

1242
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:08,200
Bowser World, Paper Bowser World Operation Grom, those are two full games that are done

1243
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:15,720
kind of similar to Super Paper Mario, and then Neo Sonic Universe, which looks kind

1244
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:21,760
of cool, kind of a brand new side-scrolling Sonic game, of course the Metroid 2 remake,

1245
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:29,520
which now has a playable demo work-in-progress thing you can test out, and then finally Chrono

1246
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,800
Resurrection, which of course you may remember got cancelled, it was the full 3D remake of

1247
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,800
Chrono Trigger.

1248
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,320
And I think what should be added to the list, they have that new Mario game that someone

1249
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:44,600
was making that was a mash-up of Halo, Mega Man, and all that stuff, that should probably

1250
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:49,120
be added to the list, but if you go check out the article, which is on Dig right now

1251
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,000
and is also on GamesRadar.com, they have links to, well, most of those games that you can

1252
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:02,920
download, of course not Chrono Resurrection, because only the devs get to play that one.

1253
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:09,960
And then I've got to import this game, Momo World War II, it's like chicks and Nazi chicks

1254
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:17,600
in bikinis or something, done anime style, it's a sexy Nazi anime girl game, I don't know,

1255
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,600
that sounds pretty awesome.

1256
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:25,760
Alright, are you guys ready to figure out who won tonight's listless segment?

1257
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,760
Why not?

1258
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,880
Alright, let's reveal the winners tonight.

1259
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:37,920
Who's Li3CC5 could do to get us to stay the definitive list as voted by you, the chatters

1260
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,700
created by us, the hosts and guests.

1261
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:48,400
Here it is, the number three thing that Li3CC5 could do to get us to stay, provide us a unicorn

1262
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,400
via Irene.

1263
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,400
Number three?

1264
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,440
Unicorns can do anything, that should have been number one, it would have made all the

1265
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,180
other dreams come true, but I won't mope, I'm okay.

1266
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:04,720
At number two, we have a tie, at number two we have a tie, number two, buy us a George

1267
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,340
Foreman full cow grilling machine, is more important than the unicorn, how about a George

1268
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,400
Foreman unicorn grilling machine?

1269
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
No!

1270
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,720
Punch your face.

1271
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,120
And not a damn thing, they done fucked up.

1272
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,760
That was number two.

1273
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,780
For number two, I was number two, I was surprised too, but then I looked at what was number

1274
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:27,120
one and I wasn't surprised at all, the number one thing that Li3CC5 could do to get us to

1275
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:34,400
stay, purchase one million copies of the Eye of Judgment, big surprise, and settle this

1276
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,400
bet once and for all.

1277
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,360
You do realize, of course, that Jamie does not get a cookie now?

1278
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,540
That's okay, I can't have a cookie.

1279
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:41,540
You know what?

1280
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:46,000
Actually, um, let's see, Heal Rob's pancreas would have been fourth and then give Jamie

1281
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,440
a cookie would have been fifth.

1282
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,640
I don't want a cookie.

1283
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,640
Alright.

1284
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,640
You know what?

1285
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:56,800
When I come up here to do the show the day after my birthday, I want banana pudding.

1286
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,040
Isn't it nice to want?

1287
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,880
Or carrot cake.

1288
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,880
Those are my demands.

1289
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:13,840
Alright, before we get into our special Skype segment tonight, I'm actually opening this

1290
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:22,280
up real quick for someone specific to give us a call here, someone that wanted to get

1291
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:30,300
through tonight, an OLR blast from the past who wanted to say some final words about Li3CC5,

1292
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,760
so just got to wait for that to come in.

1293
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,900
I know who it is.

1294
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,800
You should be scared a little bit, actually.

1295
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,800
I'm just waiting for that call to come in.

1296
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,600
Are you going to call any person?

1297
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,880
I know who you are.

1298
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,800
I told them to get by their phone.

1299
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,760
If I see a call from somebody else pop up, I'm going to be pissed.

1300
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,400
Any other last minute stories you might have by chance?

1301
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,880
Log in chat track really quick.

1302
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,600
Nah, that Nazi bean pursuit girl game looks weird.

1303
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,680
It does look weird.

1304
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,680
You are right.

1305
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,680
Alright.

1306
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,680
Oh, look!

1307
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,680
We have a call.

1308
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,680
Hi!

1309
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,680
This is Orange Launch Radio.

1310
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,680
Who's this?

1311
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,860
This is Rob.

1312
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,120
And yes, what would you like to say?

1313
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:14,840
I would like to say that I am very sick because my pre-care is hot.

1314
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,280
Hey, this is Extifer.

1315
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,280
How's it going?

1316
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,280
Hi!

1317
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,280
Oh my god, Extifer?

1318
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,840
I'm fine, even though you're an asshole.

1319
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,840
So what's up, Extifer?

1320
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:32,000
Oh, I'm doing pretty well and you?

1321
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I am.

1322
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,800
Well, my pancreas hurts a little bit, yeah.

1323
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,120
That's alright.

1324
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:42,360
You should stop letting Irene punch you in the pancreas.

1325
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,640
I'm going to do that, actually.

1326
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,200
No, that's never going to happen.

1327
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:53,720
Extifer, you used to do a show here on our station, our little network here on Live3CC5.

1328
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,240
We already canceled your show once and now we're leaving from Live3CC5 altogether.

1329
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,240
Does that make you sad?

1330
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:06,540
Yeah, actually.

1331
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:13,680
I was really sad when I couldn't do the show anymore because I live in another city now

1332
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:20,320
and it's hard for me to get over there to do any type of programming anyway, so we kind

1333
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:27,280
of ended, at least with me, it kind of ended a long time ago, but yeah, it does make me

1334
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:36,400
sad that we don't have the opportunity to do it again, I guess, unless there's an opportunity

1335
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,400
in the future.

1336
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,600
What did you think of tonight's list list, though, with the ways that Live3CC5 could

1337
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,600
get us to stay?

1338
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,720
Do you agree or is there something else that you would have put on the list?

1339
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:53,080
Oh, I'm all for the cow and the George Farm and Grill.

1340
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,080
Sounds good, huh?

1341
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,080
Well, actually...

1342
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,880
I'm like, you know, get me a cow, put it on the grill.

1343
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,240
I am like, you know, meat central.

1344
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,800
That's all I can think about.

1345
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,800
Oh, my.

1346
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,280
Did he just say, I am meat central?

1347
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,280
I think he did.

1348
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,280
He did.

1349
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,280
He said, I am meat central.

1350
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,200
Yeah, I am meat central.

1351
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,480
Is my connection breaking up because I feel like the connection is breaking up?

1352
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,480
No, it's just a little laggy, but that's OK.

1353
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,680
We're going to wrap up because we want to get to some real calls.

1354
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,680
Just kidding.

1355
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,680
Oh, snap.

1356
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,680
I'm a fake call.

1357
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,640
But I just want to ask you real quickly, do you have any parting words?

1358
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,240
I mean, it's not that we won't ever have you on All Games, our new home, but do you have

1359
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,120
any parting words for Live3CC5?

1360
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:38,800
No, I'm about ready to go bleach my asshole.

1361
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,080
So that's it.

1362
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,080
All right.

1363
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,080
All right.

1364
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,080
Have a good one.

1365
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,080
Bye, Extover.

1366
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,080
All right.

1367
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,080
Have a good synchronous.

1368
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,080
All right.

1369
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,080
You, too.

1370
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,080
Bye.

1371
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,080
Bye, Extover.

1372
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:56,360
We love you.

1373
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,360
And your asshole.

1374
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,640
That's what we should have put on the list.

1375
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,600
Live3CC5 has to bleach Extover's asshole.

1376
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,600
Yeah.

1377
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,600
Oh, God.

1378
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,600
Oh, my God.

1379
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,600
No.

1380
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,600
Ew.

1381
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,600
All right.

1382
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,600
All right.

1383
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,760
Here's the deal for tonight's Skype line.

1384
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,280
We're going to open it up, but with some boundaries tonight.

1385
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,480
Tonight, you can state your name, and you get to ask us a question, okay?

1386
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,520
But if you try to do anything else, like you'd start ranting about Jack Voldemort or whatever,

1387
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:31,160
then you're getting cut off, because tonight, we want to bring back for one last time on

1388
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,440
Live3CC5, Ask Orange Lounge.

1389
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,440
You ready, Jamie?

1390
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,440
This is for you.

1391
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:45,760
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1392
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,720
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1393
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,200
Don't forget to call us right now on the Skype line, but if you talk too much, we're hanging

1394
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,200
up on your asks.

1395
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,200
We can do that.

1396
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
We're the hosts.

1397
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,200
All right.

1398
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,200
1-877-GAME-OLR.

1399
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,880
If we don't get enough calls, then we'll, I don't know, we'll beg and plead for stuff

1400
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,880
from chat.

1401
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:05,880
All right.

1402
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,880
Here we go.

1403
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:07,880
All right.

1404
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,880
Call her.

1405
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,880
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1406
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,880
State your name.

1407
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,240
Um, Legend of Zaku.

1408
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,120
State your question, Legend of Zaku.

1409
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,360
All right.

1410
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,880
Basically, I know it's been like five and a half years and everything, but do you have

1411
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:27,320
any regrets, any regrets at all of the journey you've taken so far?

1412
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,040
I'll start with Dark Zaku.

1413
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,040
Ladies first.

1414
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,120
I regret letting Andrew tell jokes.

1415
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,520
Loki?

1416
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,320
I regret it too.

1417
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:42,120
I regret ever doing an impression of Tingle's voice.

1418
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,800
I'm surprised you didn't say I didn't regret ever buying karaoke revolution.

1419
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,800
I bet.

1420
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,800
All right.

1421
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,800
Too late.

1422
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,800
Rice Princess?

1423
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,800
Drew?

1424
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,800
Anything?

1425
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,800
I regret nothing.

1426
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Wow.

1427
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,800
That's really fucking, I mean, freaking loud.

1428
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
I told you.

1429
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Drew?

1430
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,260
If you say I regret.

1431
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,720
That's more than the question.

1432
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,720
All right.

1433
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,720
Hearts.

1434
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,720
Here's the thing though.

1435
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,280
The only thing I regret, I'm going to be honest, not doing this sooner.

1436
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,600
I have to admit.

1437
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,920
I think we could have done something like this a little while ago, but I'm excited about

1438
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,680
the changes and stuff and everything happens for a reason.

1439
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,360
I regret not coming to the studio sooner.

1440
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,800
All right.

1441
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,800
Next call.

1442
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,800
We're waiting for one.

1443
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,800
Sure.

1444
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,800
Sure.

1445
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,800
All right.

1446
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,800
Here we go.

1447
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:30,800
Here we go.

1448
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,800
We're getting another call.

1449
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,800
Hi.

1450
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,800
Caller.

1451
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,800
State your name.

1452
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,800
Hello?

1453
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,800
Lone Vacationer.

1454
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,120
Hello, Lone Vacationer.

1455
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,680
State your question, please.

1456
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,640
Yes, Rob.

1457
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:53,400
I was wondering why you had to be so retarded for Metroid instead of Chrono Trigger.

1458
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,040
The sad thing is the podcast listeners aren't going to get this because they didn't hear

1459
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,680
the bonus statement tonight.

1460
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:04,600
I voted for Super Metroid because I believe it to be the greatest video game of all time.

1461
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,200
Look, as much as I love Chrono Trigger, I loved the Final Fantasy series just a little

1462
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,200
bit more.

1463
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,960
The battles got annoying to me in Chrono Trigger.

1464
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,960
I don't know what it was, but it did have a good story.

1465
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:18,780
I respect Chrono Trigger as a game, but as far as Super Metroid, it was the music.

1466
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:23,280
It was the fact that it was a game that you could sit down and beat in one sitting, but

1467
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,040
it felt like there was so much you could do.

1468
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,840
You could play it where you collect everything.

1469
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,260
You could play it where you explore everything.

1470
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,320
You could play it to speed beat it.

1471
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,240
All of those things were accessible to a normal person.

1472
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:37,760
Usually it takes a hobbyist to speed play through a game and stuff, but just with the

1473
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,400
items and everything.

1474
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,640
It's just a game I remember very much in my memory.

1475
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,640
So there you have it.

1476
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:52,240
See the caller knew not to say anything else because that would be more than a question.

1477
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,760
Let's get to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1478
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,320
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1479
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,320
Ask Orange Lounge.

1480
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,320
State your name.

1481
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,040
The name is Rama.

1482
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,040
Hello, Rama.

1483
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,440
Please, state your question.

1484
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:10,920
My question is, to everyone, your greatest or favorite moment on Live 365?

1485
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,560
Oh shit, this is going to be a hard one.

1486
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:19,280
Oh my God, there's so much.

1487
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,360
You can't say it though because that would be more than a question, but you could private

1488
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,280
message it to me in chat and I might read it.

1489
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:30,440
DarkSakura, what was your favorite moment in all of Live 365's history?

1490
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,440
Leaving it.

1491
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,440
Yes, answer ever.

1492
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,440
Loki.

1493
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:40,400
The Live 365 Awards, were they forgot... Oh my God, do I have a clip of that?

1494
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,400
I think I do.

1495
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,400
Oh my God.

1496
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,400
Let me find a clip of that.

1497
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:48,440
Oh God, that's the best thing to go out on was when they fucking forgot our name at the

1498
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,600
Live 365 Awards.

1499
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,680
I hope we have that somewhere.

1500
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,320
I'm going to dig through this.

1501
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:57,200
Rice Princess, Drew, do you have anything?

1502
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,360
Episode 69, the whole thing.

1503
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,720
It's the whole thing.

1504
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:06,080
That was a pretty classic episode, I got to say.

1505
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,840
Oh God, I hope we can find that.

1506
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,780
It's got to be in there somewhere.

1507
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:12,180
I think... I know where it is.

1508
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,280
It was sent to me as a file.

1509
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:18,120
I know this is live radio, but guys, if you've never heard this, it is so fucking worth it.

1510
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,120
Oh wait, I have another one.

1511
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,120
What?

1512
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,120
Oh, crap.

1513
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,120
What?

1514
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,120
Nothing.

1515
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,120
Okay.

1516
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,680
Did I delete it on accident?

1517
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,680
Oh God, I did not.

1518
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,680
Oh Rob, how could you?

1519
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,680
I hope you did.

1520
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,680
It would be terrible.

1521
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,360
Well, briefly explain for the listeners what that was about.

1522
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,360
Loki, what happened?

1523
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:45,160
So we got nominated for most unlikely to hear on like terrestrial...

1524
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,400
Hold on, let me see if this is it.

1525
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,400
No, that's something else.

1526
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,080
It's like a... Why do I have a Kylie Minogue song in there?

1527
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,080
God, I'm gay.

1528
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:00,200
It's like most unlikely to hear on radio or something like that, which is weird because

1529
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,240
they have like 80 stations and we have a ton of 80 stations around here, but we won that.

1530
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,240
And...

1531
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,240
No, we didn't win.

1532
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,240
We got nominated for it.

1533
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,240
Oh, we got nominated.

1534
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,240
I'm sorry.

1535
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,240
We didn't win that.

1536
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,640
We got nominated and they forgot to even mention our names.

1537
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,640
Yeah, they were reading the nominees off an envelope and they completely left us off.

1538
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:22,680
And we were in the back going, hey, because it's really funny, you can hear it on the

1539
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,680
recording.

1540
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,120
Oh God, I wish I still had it.

1541
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,840
I'm going to be really sad if I can't find it.

1542
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,640
It would be for Afterbirth maybe?

1543
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,880
No, because I want the podcast people to hear it too.

1544
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,160
I did find this.

1545
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,160
Oh, nevermind.

1546
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,400
I can't do that one.

1547
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,400
It's too long.

1548
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,400
Oh.

1549
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,400
All right, I'll play this.

1550
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,400
You remember this sound clip?

1551
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,400
Here's an old sound clip.

1552
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,080
This is Tom Brokaw on the West Coast fixing the word bukkake.

1553
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:49,140
This is the edited version that they aired on the West Coast.

1554
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,800
This is actually a clip from Howard Stern, but it was so funny here on the show when

1555
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,800
they played it.

1556
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,800
Moscow tonight.

1557
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,360
Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously

1558
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,360
today.

1559
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,760
The first crash happened in Buchalki.

1560
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,920
That's about 110 miles south of Moscow.

1561
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,920
Okay.

1562
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:06,920
That's not the funny way.

1563
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:07,920
That's not right.

1564
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,920
That ain't right.

1565
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,600
People on the West Coast got gypped of hearing bukkake.

1566
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,600
Tom.

1567
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,640
In this report out of Moscow tonight, two Russian planes carrying a total of more than

1568
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:19,280
100 people crashed almost simultaneously today.

1569
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:26,400
The first crash happened in Buchalki about 110 miles south of Moscow.

1570
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,400
He said bukkake.

1571
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:32,800
That clip was courtesy of the Howard Stern show, but that bukkake thing, I swear to God,

1572
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:37,280
gave us like a month worth of stuff.

1573
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,240
I don't think I have it anymore.

1574
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,240
I'm so sad.

1575
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,720
What about the one where he goes tax cunts or something like that?

1576
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,720
Tax cunts?

1577
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,720
Oh, yeah.

1578
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:45,720
I remember that.

1579
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,720
I don't know if I have that.

1580
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:51,680
I don't think I'm going to be able to find that clip.

1581
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,680
If I do, I will put it on the website or something.

1582
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,900
It's just so old.

1583
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:59,280
I think a lot of the old files just got purged.

1584
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,360
Over time, it happens.

1585
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,580
I do have this.

1586
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,480
This is what became of that.

1587
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,480
Gaming radio.

1588
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:11,040
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1589
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,040
Buchalki.

1590
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,040
Orange Lounge Radio.

1591
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,320
Oh, my God.

1592
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,560
We just talked over it, you stupid bitch.

1593
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,560
Oh, my gosh.

1594
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,560
Talk with us.

1595
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,560
Buchalki.

1596
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,560
Orange Lounge Radio.

1597
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,560
Tax cunts.

1598
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,560
That's hilarious.

1599
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,560
Oh, my gosh.

1600
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,560
That was epic.

1601
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,560
That was more than a question.

1602
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,560
Sorry.

1603
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:41,800
You should play all of the old promos or buffers or whatever.

1604
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,800
Oh, you can't.

1605
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,760
I mean, you could string them in a sequence or something.

1606
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,760
Some of them are stupid.

1607
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
I love them.

1608
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,800
Max, some of them are so stupid.

1609
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,320
They were like the ketchup.

1610
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,000
I still have the nori nori nori promo that never aired.

1611
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,320
Oh, wow.

1612
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,320
That's old school.

1613
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,320
I'll send it to you later.

1614
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,320
All right.

1615
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,280
My favorite moment in the Orange Lounge Radio history was the drug show where Jamie drank

1616
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:12,120
so much tequila, she lied in my bed face down after consuming an entire box of waffles and

1617
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,840
had me delivering waffles to her.

1618
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:20,720
And I was running up the wall yelling, I'm in the matrix, I'm in the matrix.

1619
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:24,800
And how sober was I by the end of the show?

1620
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,960
We can't forget Super Bacon either.

1621
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,640
And I wonder why my pancreas is fucked.

1622
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,640
The deep fried rice.

1623
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,640
Oh, rice balls.

1624
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,640
Remember when we did Peep Jousting?

1625
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,640
Peep Wars.

1626
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,640
Oh, my God.

1627
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,640
I think that was actually on a Wednesday night show.

1628
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,640
It was.

1629
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:42,240
Basically, you take two marshmallow Peeps and you put toothpicks in them and then put

1630
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:46,920
them in the microwave and it's Peep Jousting because they get really big in the microwave

1631
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,080
and then eventually one slaughters the other.

1632
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,600
It's so fucking hilarious.

1633
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,600
All right.

1634
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,600
Good times.

1635
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,800
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1636
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,800
State your name.

1637
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,800
GS68.

1638
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,800
GS68.

1639
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,760
And what is your question for tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?

1640
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,320
Any progress on the Fahnemey panel?

1641
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,000
Any progress on the Fahnemey panel?

1642
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
No.

1643
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Shit.

1644
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And I probably would.

1645
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
That's more than a question.

1646
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,440
And if I remember correctly, that's Memorial Day weekend, which is the first weekend in

1647
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,440
May.

1648
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,440
Yeah.

1649
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,440
Last weekend in May.

1650
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,440
Last weekend in May.

1651
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,440
I know.

1652
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,440
Okay.

1653
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,440
Hmm.

1654
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,440
Let me know.

1655
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,440
I'll go and do the panel myself.

1656
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:28,320
Well, I'll take Rice Princess next to her and I'll just say their dark soccer at

1657
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,320
Logan.

1658
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,320
No, no, no.

1659
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,320
No.

1660
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,320
If it's the last weekend in May.

1661
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,320
I'll be Loki.

1662
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,320
If it's the last weekend in May, that's fine.

1663
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,880
The first weekend in May, but I'm actually going to be, well, I'm gone up, out of town.

1664
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:46,720
I'm actually going to Vegas on my anniversary and not taking Nelly with me, unfortunately.

1665
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,720
It'll work.

1666
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,720
I got to say this.

1667
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,800
DJ Jinai in chat says, favorite time on OLR?

1668
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,020
The lesbians in the Mississippi orgy with Sky.

1669
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:57,080
If you didn't hear last year's April Fool's joke, that was so fucking funny.

1670
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,080
Seriously, go find it.

1671
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,080
All right.

1672
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,080
We have another call.

1673
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,080
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1674
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,080
Who's this?

1675
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,080
State your name.

1676
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,080
This is Jayden.

1677
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,080
Hello, Jayden.

1678
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,080
And a long time listener, rare caller.

1679
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,080
We don't hear from you much.

1680
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,040
Jayden, state your question.

1681
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,320
Yes.

1682
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:15,980
I have actually a very favorite moment in live 365 history.

1683
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:20,480
You better phrase it as a question or you're in trouble.

1684
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,480
Okay.

1685
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,240
This is jeopardy, bitch.

1686
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:30,400
Do you remember when Loki sang, oops, I did it again?

1687
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,400
That was a good job.

1688
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,400
All right.

1689
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,880
Do I remember when Loki sang, oops, I did it again?

1690
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,800
No, but God, I wish I had a recording of that.

1691
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,360
You must have done it in that same episode.

1692
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,600
No, it wasn't the same episode.

1693
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,960
It was later on when we tried to recapture the moment.

1694
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,780
We tried to do it again later and that's when we learned our lesson that lightning never

1695
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:49,360
strikes twice because the second time we played, well, apparently Jayden disagrees.

1696
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,720
He said it was very funny still.

1697
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,720
I don't remember.

1698
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:57,360
I don't remember it, but I sort of remember vaguely doing something that wasn't funny.

1699
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,640
It was still pretty damn funny.

1700
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,640
All right.

1701
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,640
All right.

1702
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,200
Thank you for your question and following the rules very well.

1703
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,200
He had a challenge there.

1704
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,200
He goes creative.

1705
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,200
All right.

1706
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,200
All right.

1707
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,200
Hello.

1708
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,920
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1709
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:12,920
Who's this?

1710
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,920
This is Ospher.

1711
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,920
Ospher.

1712
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:16,920
All right.

1713
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,720
Please state your question, Ospher.

1714
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:23,680
How much do you charge for autographed Xbox 360 faceplates and what's your favorite dish

1715
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,680
at the Olive Garden?

1716
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,680
That was a two-part question.

1717
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,680
She's quick.

1718
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,680
That's all right.

1719
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,520
We'll let it slide.

1720
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,520
Here we go.

1721
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,520
How much do we charge for an autographed Xbox 360 faceplate?

1722
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,560
I don't see why we wouldn't charge anything more than the cost of the faceplate plus shipping.

1723
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,940
We're not out to make a profit on it.

1724
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:43,760
If you want one, which I hear you do, we'll work something out.

1725
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,640
I've got some extra faceplates.

1726
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,640
Do you?

1727
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,640
Yeah.

1728
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,640
You want to just give them one?

1729
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,640
Yeah.

1730
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,760
We need to airbrush it white and then autograph it.

1731
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,440
I have no extra white ones because I bought other ones.

1732
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,440
Oh.

1733
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,440
All right.

1734
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,440
We'll figure something out, Ospher.

1735
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,440
Another question.

1736
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,440
I like this one.

1737
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,960
What about the Olive Garden?

1738
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,400
The breadsticks.

1739
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:11,960
Mine was the, what did they call it, Pasta Rustica or something like that, and they got

1740
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,640
rid of it, those assholes.

1741
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,260
And then I like the Tuscan chicken.

1742
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:16,260
They got rid of that, too.

1743
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,260
What about the fuckers?

1744
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,260
I'm mad at Olive Garden right now.

1745
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,960
Rob's not allowed to tell anybody he likes anything at the Olive Garden.

1746
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,200
I can't eat them anymore anyway, at least for the next month while I'm on this.

1747
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,080
I'm rather plain, so I always get the spaghetti with meat sauce, so.

1748
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,080
You are boring.

1749
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,080
Love it.

1750
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,080
I always used to get the shrimp scampi.

1751
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,080
Actually, I really like the risotto.

1752
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:39,080
What's the name of that chicken dish on our first or third date or something that I got?

1753
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,080
I don't know.

1754
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:44,160
It's some chicken dish with pasta, and I also like their Zuppa de whatever the hell's in

1755
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,160
it.

1756
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,440
Yeah, the white one with sausage and potatoes.

1757
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,440
Mmm.

1758
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,440
That's really good.

1759
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,440
Oh, God.

1760
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,440
My pancreas hurts just thinking about it.

1761
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,440
All right.

1762
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,440
Thanks for the question, caller.

1763
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,440
Take care.

1764
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,440
We'll figure something out about that faceplate.

1765
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,440
All right.

1766
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,440
Skype line's still open.

1767
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,440
I don't see any need to close.

1768
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,440
I'm so sorry.

1769
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,440
I'm so short tonight.

1770
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,440
Caller, please state your name.

1771
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,440
It's SSJ1 at your mat.

1772
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:09,320
Hello, and please state your question.

1773
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:13,040
My question is, what would be your dream interview to have on the show?

1774
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,200
Ooh, that's a good one.

1775
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,400
Dream interview to have on the show.

1776
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,840
Who would be your dream interview?

1777
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:22,240
Loki, we'll start with you.

1778
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,560
I guess the developers of Grand Theft Auto maybe?

1779
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,280
I don't know.

1780
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,280
All right.

1781
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,760
Eric Sacher, your dream interview?

1782
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,760
Akira Yamaoka.

1783
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,760
Did we have him?

1784
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,760
No, we didn't have him on the show, but we've seen him.

1785
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:37,760
Oh, no.

1786
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,760
That's right.

1787
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,960
You narrowly missed it.

1788
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:44,520
That's right, because somebody wanted to go interview somebody and lost the recording

1789
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,520
of the damn interview.

1790
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,080
I'll throw a curveball at you in just a minute.

1791
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,680
I'll tell you why, too.

1792
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:57,560
Drew, what would be your dream interview to see us interview?

1793
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,000
Freeze pop.

1794
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,080
We had one guy on the show, remember?

1795
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,080
All of them.

1796
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,080
All of them.

1797
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,080
Here in studio performing a la Mo.

1798
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,080
Yes.

1799
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,080
All right.

1800
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,080
A la Mo.

1801
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,080
I like that.

1802
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,080
A la Mo.

1803
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,080
Rice Princess.

1804
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,120
Christian Bale naked in front of me.

1805
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,120
You're asking too much.

1806
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,120
Via a unicorn.

1807
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:22,280
Via a unicorn, and there won't be a lot of talking.

1808
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,840
I'm just going to say this.

1809
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:29,320
My dream interview would be Morgan Webb, because I'd have a field day.

1810
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,600
You better have a damn good reason.

1811
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,600
I would have a field day.

1812
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,600
Wait, wait, wait.

1813
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,600
Stop.

1814
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,600
I got to stop you real quick.

1815
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,600
What?

1816
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,600
They posted an old video clip of her.

1817
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,600
She was on the Tyra Bank show.

1818
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,600
Bye, caller.

1819
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,600
Thanks for the question.

1820
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:46,520
She was actually on the Tyra Bank show one time and spouting off some three different

1821
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:50,480
types of gamers and what you could learn from your guy based on the types of games he played,

1822
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,440
and that was so retarded.

1823
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,520
The chat room is yelling at me.

1824
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:59,320
I don't want the interview because I think it's going to be... Let me ask her some questions

1825
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,320
in public.

1826
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,320
That's all I want.

1827
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,320
All right.

1828
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,320
You forgot Nathan.

1829
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,320
Oh, I'm sorry, Nathan.

1830
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,320
I didn't have anything to say.

1831
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,320
Damn it.

1832
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,320
He's so emotional.

1833
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,320
Caller, state your name.

1834
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,320
Hello?

1835
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,320
Hi.

1836
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,320
Caller, what is your name?

1837
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,320
Yeah.

1838
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,320
Gold Banjo here.

1839
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,320
Hello, Gold.

1840
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:27,440
I was wondering, seeing as how you're an internet radio show and all, I'm wondering if anybody's

1841
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:31,160
ever threatened you or stalked you or something.

1842
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,160
Yes.

1843
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,160
Wow.

1844
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,160
Threatened us or stalked us.

1845
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,160
That's a good one.

1846
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,800
That's what stalked you.

1847
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,800
I don't remember anyone.

1848
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,920
Wait, who?

1849
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,920
No.

1850
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:42,920
Oh, God.

1851
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,400
Did he?

1852
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
Yes.

1853
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,400
Yes.

1854
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,760
Or she?

1855
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,760
You know what?

1856
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,200
There was a person that was borderline stalking me.

1857
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,280
See you later.

1858
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,760
I'm listening to what you're saying now.

1859
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,760
Yeah.

1860
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,760
I was more into questions.

1861
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,760
Sorry, buddy.

1862
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,760
All right.

1863
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,920
He cut in and out a little bit, but yes, I forgot.

1864
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,800
There was an infamous person.

1865
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:08,040
I'm not going to say their name on the air, but there was an infamous person in Life is

1866
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,180
Five history.

1867
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,400
He actually was kind of a trusted member of Orange and Andre.

1868
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,400
He was a moderator of our channel for some time, and then he just kind of... He went

1869
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,080
kind of loopy, and dude, he called my cell phone.

1870
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:22,080
I don't know how he got my number, but he like... I got this voicemail message once.

1871
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,600
It was like, why did you ban me?

1872
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,040
It was like really scary and creepy.

1873
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,040
Oh.

1874
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,040
Well.

1875
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,040
Well, we got better.

1876
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,040
Yeah.

1877
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,040
Yeah.

1878
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,040
It was-

1879
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,040
Yeah.

1880
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,040
Yeah.

1881
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,160
But I got better.

1882
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:42,760
I don't think we've ever really had anything beyond that, though, and that was more just

1883
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,960
kind of like a silly internet prank.

1884
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,280
Not that that's acceptable.

1885
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,200
It's not, but nobody's ever threatened us with death or anything.

1886
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,200
No.

1887
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,200
We're not famous.

1888
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,200
What the hell are you talking about?

1889
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,200
All right.

1890
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,200
All right.

1891
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,200
I'll threaten you with death if you don't change your vote.

1892
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,200
Hi.

1893
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,200
Shut up.

1894
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,200
Hi, callers.

1895
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,200
Please state your name.

1896
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,200
Yeah.

1897
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,200
What's up?

1898
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,200
This is Ross Deal UT.

1899
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:08,240
Ross Deal UT, and please state your question.

1900
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:15,280
How many blind monkeys do you think it took for Ubisoft to come up with the name HAWX?

1901
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:20,420
One for each letter, four.

1902
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:26,040
Only one, because you have to understand, hawks is edgy because they have an X instead

1903
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,760
of a KS.

1904
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,320
We're thinking 90s now.

1905
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,320
It took 90 monkeys?

1906
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,320
Wow.

1907
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,320
That's extreme.

1908
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,280
You're laughing too much, and that's more than a question.

1909
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,280
No, but just kidding.

1910
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,280
We've got to free up the line.

1911
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,280
All right.

1912
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,280
I like this.

1913
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,280
This is like a condensed...

1914
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,280
It's great.

1915
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,320
Look how many people were getting in tonight for the last...

1916
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,320
Okay.

1917
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,320
We still got...

1918
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,640
I know there's still people trying to get in, so I'm waiting.

1919
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,640
All right.

1920
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,640
Hi.

1921
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,640
Here we go.

1922
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,640
Another call.

1923
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,640
Hello, caller.

1924
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:53,640
Please state your name.

1925
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,640
Hello.

1926
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:57,200
This is your favorite Swede, A.K.

1927
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,200
River.

1928
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:02,880
Hello, and please state your question, our favorite Swede.

1929
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:10,160
Why did you start out in Live 365 in the first place?

1930
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,940
What a damn good question.

1931
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:17,000
Go figure it comes from someone not from America.

1932
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,440
Why did we start on Live 365 in the first place?

1933
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,440
I have my answer.

1934
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,000
I don't know if anyone else wants to contribute.

1935
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It was easy.

1936
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Here's the thing.

1937
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Well, two reasons.

1938
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:33,480
A, it was easy because of the fact that Live 365 makes it pretty easy to just have all

1939
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:38,800
your MP3s in one place, you sign in, you go, and you didn't have to have that resource

1940
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,520
to run a stream 24-7 because when we first started the station, we thought it was going

1941
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:49,120
to be about the music as much as it was the show, but our true love really ended up being

1942
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,280
the show, and so Live 365 made it very easy to go 24-7.

1943
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:59,760
And this show is a spinoff of sorts of another show under Sedation Live, which is hosted

1944
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:04,940
by Travis Donovan, who's now on our network.

1945
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:11,200
That show was about, boy, this is a long history, probably more than you bargained for, but

1946
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:17,960
that show started in 2001 as a show actually about Rocky Horror Picture Show, but it didn't

1947
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,760
really keep that theme very long.

1948
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,360
We didn't talk about that very much.

1949
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,360
Everything.

1950
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,360
We talked about everything.

1951
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:28,920
Dude, you know, one time, if you've ever seen Cat House Girls, the guy who runs that, Dennis,

1952
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,280
one time we had him on the show as an interview, and it all started as a crank call.

1953
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:36,120
It was the most epic moment in under Sedation Live history, I'm telling you.

1954
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,120
I remember that.

1955
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,760
But under Sedation Live was on Live 365, and I saw how easy it was there, and so it just

1956
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:44,920
kind of made it easy, and that's really why we were there.

1957
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,040
Good question.

1958
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,040
Thank you.

1959
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,040
Have a good one.

1960
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,040
All right.

1961
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,340
Let's see if we get some more.

1962
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:54,400
201877 Game OLR.

1963
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,400
How many more?

1964
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,400
Oh my God.

1965
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,800
This segment's going long.

1966
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:58,800
That's all right.

1967
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,800
It's the last.

1968
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:00,800
We got a little time, right?

1969
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,800
You guys are okay?

1970
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,800
All right.

1971
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,800
Jamie's starting to get a little restless.

1972
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:04,800
We've got to wind down soon.

1973
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,800
All right.

1974
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,800
Hello, caller.

1975
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,800
Please state your name.

1976
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:08,800
Hello?

1977
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,800
Hello.

1978
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,800
Hi, caller.

1979
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,800
Please state your name.

1980
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,800
This is Misty.

1981
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,440
Well, hello, Misty.

1982
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,200
I'm glad to hear from Misty.

1983
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,200
All right, Misty.

1984
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:30,080
I know you probably went waiting forever to get in, but please state your question.

1985
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:34,560
If I were to win the lottery and bribe all of your bosses with however much they need

1986
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,320
it, would you people fucking come to ASIN?

1987
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,320
I want to.

1988
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,320
Hi.

1989
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,840
I have been... How long have I been talking to you?

1990
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:44,840
Oh, sweetie.

1991
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:45,840
I love you.

1992
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,840
No, no, no, no, no.

1993
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:47,840
This is Misty.

1994
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,840
She's special.

1995
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,840
Fine.

1996
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,840
I have my finger on the Hangout button as much as I love Misty.

1997
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,840
Yep, yep.

1998
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:53,840
She got her chance.

1999
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:54,840
All right.

2000
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,840
Hold on.

2001
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,200
Jamie is giving a pass, so she can finish her thought.

2002
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:05,120
I really, really want to go to ASIN, and I've been bringing this up since last year, that

2003
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:10,580
we need to get our asses to Chicago and go to convention, and I actually need to finish

2004
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:14,120
one of my costumes to actually be able to wear it there, but... And I also want to

2005
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,120
go hang out in Artist Alley with Meg Z and Chris, because they're going to be there this

2006
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,320
year too.

2007
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:23,120
Honestly, I would be going this year if it wasn't for my medical issues.

2008
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:27,040
I really was considering going this year and making it happen, but my medical issues have

2009
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,280
made me think twice about it.

2010
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,460
It's very unfortunate, but I don't know.

2011
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:34,280
If a miracle pulls through in the next week, I might reconsider, but right now, I have

2012
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,680
to say no.

2013
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,840
Loki, any chance in hell you'd go to ASIN, even if she won the lottery and paid for it

2014
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,840
for you?

2015
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:44,760
Even if she won the lottery, my wife is... I can't go, because my wife can't stay home

2016
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,760
alone.

2017
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,760
Can I represent us at ASIN?

2018
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:47,760
Ha, ha, ha.

2019
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,760
Oh, sure.

2020
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,760
Go for it.

2021
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,760
All right.

2022
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,160
Besides, I'm going... If someone pays my way, I'll go to ASIN.

2023
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,160
All right.

2024
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,160
Thank you for the call.

2025
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,160
Everyone give Misty a kiss.

2026
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,160
Bye, Misty.

2027
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,160
All right.

2028
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,160
All right.

2029
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,160
All right.

2030
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,160
All right.

2031
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,160
All right.

2032
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,160
Fun fact from Bobby Black Wolf.

2033
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,480
All games radio was on live 365 in one of its incarnations.

2034
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:13,360
In fact, they used to give people the link to OLR to test the live 365 player.

2035
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,360
Wow.

2036
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,360
That's great.

2037
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,880
So, you know, isn't it funny how things come full circle?

2038
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:19,880
All right.

2039
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:20,880
Maybe one more.

2040
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,880
One more.

2041
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,280
1877 game OLR.

2042
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:27,400
I wanted to get Misty in, because I know she doesn't get to listen to live much, and I

2043
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,400
wanted to get her.

2044
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,560
That's why I gave Misty the pass, because she's special.

2045
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,560
All right.

2046
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,560
It's a girl thing.

2047
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,560
Admit it.

2048
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,560
All right.

2049
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,560
Oop.

2050
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,560
Here we go.

2051
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,560
One more.

2052
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,560
Last call.

2053
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,560
Last question.

2054
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,560
Guess what?

2055
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,560
You're the last one.

2056
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:42,560
Please state your name.

2057
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,560
DT.

2058
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,560
Hello, DT.

2059
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:49,120
First off, we all need to tip our hat to Dark Tetsuya for a moment and praise him for the

2060
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:53,920
work he's done for our station, because he's been listening here since episode one.

2061
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,720
He's been a longtime supporter.

2062
01:27:55,720 --> 01:28:00,080
He writes website articles for our front page, even when the damn thing is deader than a

2063
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,120
doornail.

2064
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,720
He has updated the OLR Wiki with articles.

2065
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,920
He keeps things posted on the forum.

2066
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,040
Please, everybody, let's give Dark Tetsuya a round of applause for the hard work he's

2067
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:13,040
done for our station.

2068
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:18,200
Now, you're not allowed to cry or anything, because that would be more than a question.

2069
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:21,560
There's more, too, because remember all the stuff he did for Sac Bay money before that.

2070
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,560
That's true.

2071
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:27,160
He's a very hardworking, fine young lad, and we're glad to have him on board.

2072
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,160
You better believe it.

2073
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,560
We're going to find something for you to do on our new home.

2074
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:35,960
You know what I should have put on, the things to say with Live 365, they'd get me a better

2075
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:36,960
chair.

2076
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,880
Look, the man has waited all night to get through.

2077
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,160
He's the last call.

2078
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:47,120
Dark Tetsuya, please, the last question of the night for Last Orange Lounge.

2079
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:52,720
Okay, let me set this up.

2080
01:28:52,720 --> 01:29:05,840
As you know, she's planning on coming to California in October.

2081
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,240
Would there be a chance of getting her on the show somehow?

2082
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:12,280
Is she going to be here on a Sunday?

2083
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,280
Or an I?

2084
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:18,840
Is she going to be here on a Sunday?

2085
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:19,840
I think.

2086
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:20,840
Okay.

2087
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:21,840
Let's find out.

2088
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:22,840
Abso-fricking-lutely.

2089
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,840
Abso-fricking-lutely.

2090
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,800
If you and Misty together, we'd love to have that on the show.

2091
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,800
Absolutely.

2092
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,920
If she's here on a Sunday, you guys can be here live.

2093
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,920
You know what?

2094
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,840
Even if she can't be here on a Sunday for whatever travel reasons, we will figure out

2095
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,520
a tape segment just for you guys, because you've been so supportive of the show, and

2096
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,800
it's five and a half years.

2097
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:40,800
So there you have it.

2098
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:41,800
Wow.

2099
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:42,800
Thank you.

2100
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,800
All right.

2101
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,800
You're welcome.

2102
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,800
It's been a dream of mine.

2103
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,400
Oh, Dark Tetsuya, you know I love you, but that was more than a question.

2104
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,400
Have a good night.

2105
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,400
All right.

2106
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,400
Anyhow.

2107
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:57,400
Oh, that was a fun segment.

2108
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,760
God, I hope I didn't ruin his moment or whatever.

2109
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:02,400
Of course they can come on the show.

2110
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,400
Of course.

2111
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,400
We want them.

2112
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,400
I would be pissed if they didn't.

2113
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,400
Mm-hmm.

2114
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,280
I would be so pissed if they didn't.

2115
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,280
So yes.

2116
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,280
We'll make it work one way or the other.

2117
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,280
Absolutely.

2118
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,280
All right.

2119
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,280
Damn.

2120
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,120
That's a lot of calls tonight, and I think it's time to wrap things up.

2121
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,160
We already did last minute stories.

2122
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,060
Oh my God.

2123
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,440
We missed one thing, though.

2124
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:24,680
I was supposed to do it after the list list tonight, and I completely glossed over it.

2125
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,560
What segment did I forget, boys and girls?

2126
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:28,560
What segment did we forget?

2127
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,560
FUs of the Week.

2128
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,560
Yes.

2129
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,560
The FUs of the Week.

2130
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,560
Roar.

2131
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,560
All right.

2132
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,560
I've got to get the music.

2133
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,560
Holy crap.

2134
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,560
Wouldn't that be hilarious?

2135
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,560
Ro's been an FU to Life 365, so whatever.

2136
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,560
Okay.

2137
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,760
Hold on really quickly, because I've got to set this up here, and so you may hear just

2138
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:46,760
a moment of silence.

2139
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:50,160
Actually, I'll let the music play for a little bit.

2140
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:59,520
Let the music play.

2141
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:07,320
Here it is, the FUs of the Week.

2142
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,320
Dark Soccer.

2143
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,320
Start us off.

2144
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,320
Fuck you, Life 365.

2145
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,320
Loki.

2146
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,320
Fuck you, Life 365.

2147
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,320
Drew.

2148
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,000
Fuck you, Life 365.

2149
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Rice Princess.

2150
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,440
Fuck you, Life 365.

2151
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,240
Silent Nathan.

2152
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:34,880
And my FU of the Week, FU, Life 365, for upping your rates and using scare tactics to motivate

2153
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:41,600
it, and FU the RIA, yes, for starting the whole damn thing in the first place.

2154
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,560
And honestly, this all goes back to you assholes forgetting our names.

2155
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:51,520
No, actually, I've got to say in seriousness, we have met some good people at Life 365,

2156
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,520
so I don't...

2157
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,520
I'm sorry, Betty.

2158
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,520
She was a real sweetheart.

2159
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,520
Yeah.

2160
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,520
There are some great people, so...

2161
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,520
And I've got speakers.

2162
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:02,920
When we say FU, we mean to the corporate decisions that were made there, and not necessarily

2163
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,920
the people.

2164
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,000
Just want to get that out there, because in our five and a half years, we have interacted

2165
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,400
with a lot of great people and other broadcasters that we've met through Life 365, so please

2166
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,480
don't misappropriate our angst.

2167
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,760
All right.

2168
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:21,200
So anyhow, that brings us to the very last part where we give our final thoughts.

2169
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,640
Nathan, any final thoughts?

2170
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,840
Rice Princess, your final thought?

2171
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,200
Yay.

2172
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:31,040
Drew, your final thought?

2173
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,040
Indignation.

2174
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,040
Loki, your final thought?

2175
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:38,960
My final thought is I need to play some more games other than Saints Row, although I may

2176
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,520
go back to Saints Row to finish the activities.

2177
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,760
Got to get them achievement points.

2178
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:51,960
My FU of the Wii...I'm sorry, not my FU of the Wii.

2179
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,880
My final thought is I really don't want it to flare up again and end up in the hospital.

2180
01:32:55,880 --> 01:33:01,440
I hate to sound like a baby in a hypochondriac, but keep your fingers crossed for me, kid.

2181
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,440
All right.

2182
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,440
Ferret is next.

2183
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,440
Ferret, your final thought, please?

2184
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,160
All right, Dark...All right, shut up.

2185
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,160
You had two final thoughts.

2186
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,920
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

2187
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,640
Reject false icons.

2188
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,480
All right.

2189
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:19,800
That's going to do it for Orange Lounge Radio, the last live program here on our network

2190
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,360
on Live 365.

2191
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:28,240
Thank you to all that have supported us since May 22nd, I want to say, of 2002 when the

2192
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:36,200
stream went live and June 23rd of 2002 when episode one of Orange Lounge Radio first aired.

2193
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:42,480
You guys have helped make us probably the longest...one of, if not the longest running

2194
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:48,920
video game podcasts and video game radio programs in the world.

2195
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,200
We just want to thank all you guys for your support and it's all of you that have helped

2196
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:56,720
make this happen, all you guys in chat, all you guys on the forums, all you guys on Live

2197
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:01,140
Journal, Myspace, Facebook, and everybody that downloads this show, thank you for five

2198
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:02,140
and a half years.

2199
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:07,320
It has been fun on our own stream, but the party ain't over and we look forward to the

2200
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,920
next chapter of Orange Lounge Radio.

2201
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,480
That was a really big chapter one.

2202
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,980
This is like War and Peace right here.

2203
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:19,100
We look forward to the next chapter of OLR when we combine forces with all games radio

2204
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:24,320
and come together to make the Voltron of independent gaming podcasting.

2205
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:29,340
And remember, if you like what you hear, tell a couple of friends about Orange Lounge Radio.

2206
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:35,460
It's word of mouth that helps makes everything go around and brings more listeners to us

2207
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:39,760
so that we can slowly take over the world.

2208
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,560
Can I rant anymore or is that it?

2209
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,560
Are we done?

2210
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,560
Are we out of here?

2211
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,560
Sure.

2212
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,560
We done.

2213
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,560
Goodbye Live 365.

2214
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,560
Bye.

2215
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:49,560
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2216
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,560

2217
