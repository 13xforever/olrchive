5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,400
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,920
We now tape live on all games.com every Sunday night. We got a small little crowd

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,440
Hello to everybody in our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,820
Who are listening to us and our brand new sound quality as well lots of compliments on the sound of the show tonight

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,560
We're excited to be here. We got lots more stuff for you in part B more gaming news

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,800
We have the mailbag we're giving away a stupid award tonight

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,240
And we've got an interview with somebody pretty rad of Farb's the man behind Rom check fail will be talking to him very shortly

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,840
but first more gaming news

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,400
Yes, loki. Yes, all right anyways

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,660
So this is not big surprise because we've been

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,520
Seeing sorts of similar bands with other rock star games, but this time brazil has banned bully

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,500
Of course you know before the whole banning problem was manhunt 2 now for whatever reason they've deemed it

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
inappropriate for sale and

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,640
The ban has prevented the game from being imported distributed sold or promoted on the websites and stores in the country

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,280
apparently Brazilian distributors retailers

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,880
will have 30 days to comply with the ban and it came in response to

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:48,160
The requests of the Brazilian youth center it said the aggravating factor is that everything in the game takes place inside a school

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,080
and

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,200
that's

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
not acceptable, so

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
apparently of course take two has

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,440
They said it will not have a material impact on the sales of their popular title

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,640
Doesn't sound like that. They're going to appeal it, so

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,960
You're in brazil and you want to play bully. Oh well guess you're out of luck

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,600
You might have to import it or something huh not that I don't think you're missing a whole lot, but you know

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,360
Now what's weird to me this game is somewhat old, so are we talking like all the way back to the PlayStation 2 version?

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
No, this is a scholarship edition

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,720
So it's stupid though because the game has been out. I was going to say the game's already been out, so what's the big difference?

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,280
It's not like this games like an M rated game or anything

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,560
This is like a teen rated game over here, so I don't understand what the big deal is. Oh, it's this school

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,960
Oh, that's why oh, I'm sorry

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,060
It's a school. Did you actually play they haven't played the game? They didn't see like what contents in the game

37
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,380
They're just oh because it's cool and bullies in tile must be because you're a bully and

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,280
So we don't like it. I'd be curious to hear and I know we've got to have some listeners in Brazil

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,000
I got because we got listeners from around the world

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'd be kind of curious to hear this from their perspective

41
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,000
And I want to know can you go walk in to you know your big game stores there?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I mean, I don't know if you have the same type of things we do only have 30 days to comply so go quick

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,560
I'm curious. Can you walk into a store and buy bully on the PlayStation 2 or have you been able to do that in the past?

44
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,560
That's why I'm kind of curious about so

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,280
We'll see. I don't know dark soccer. What do you think about banning video games in countries?

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,640
Retarded yeah, I mean is there I I think that banning anything is

47
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,800
Unless we're banning the ferret. No just kidding. I I understand to an extent why people

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,620
Why things are illegal you know why?

49
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,500
certain

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,220
Things that they think might be harmful to the development of children

51
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,580
But you know I believe that it's not the government's place to decide. It's the parents place to decide I

52
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,260
Guess despite all our I guess despite all our bitching in part a about the way society is right now

53
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,260
I guess we should be thankful where we live in a place where at least we have that decision to make

54
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,000
Where you don't see the country banning things if they'll just give a shit for it. Oh well, yeah

55
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,500
So all right well moving on to other you know I don't know if I'd would call this happy news

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,620
I don't think it's really happy for these people that we're working at develop

57
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,380
develop was a gaming company and

58
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,420
Unfortunately they have just lost some projects because the staff was cut from 25 down to just six senior staff

59
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,540
President Michael scandizzo though says I guess he's optimistic

60
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,700
He says if somebody came in tomorrow and said here's a whole bunch of money

61
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,340
Can you get back up and running then by Monday we could be at back up and running it would have to be soon

62
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,900
But if anybody wanted to come in and save us

63
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,640
We'd give the whole kitchen sink to them to them on the extremely cheap

64
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,060
Otherwise after almost 10 years of this group working together. We're going to have to dissolve

65
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,760
Developed was formed in 2003 and it was a bunch of people that used to work for Blizzard

66
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,220
But here's here's the punchline the only game that's come out of develop

67
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,780
Yaris

68
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,260
So if you were hoping for Yaris to I don't know if that's really gonna happen now

69
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,020
I guess I kind of feel bad for these guys though because they were they were probably paid a crap load of money for what?

70
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,980
Couldn't have been a too difficult a game. They might have had all these other projects

71
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,900
We'll never know about that could have been pretty rad and they couldn't get one, right?

72
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,100
But I mean it was Yaris come on Yaris too, then you're probably a masochist

73
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,460
Well, I don't know a juiced in and chat says let them die

74
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:33,240
I chat that orange songs radio.com if you want to participate can't save them all I guess that's true. Don't worry

75
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
EA is hiring right just kidding

76
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,860
Anyway, can I get can I yes, you have some good news

77
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,360
We actually have a video now of a new character for Street Fighter 4

78
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,620
Who is named Rufus and he's actually bigger than e Honda

79
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,580
And he's supposedly really fast for being bigger than e Honda so

80
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,820
Interesting there's also another character called el fuerte

81
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,060
Who is supposed to be just a overall playable character

82
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,980
I don't really see anything though about how the character moves. He's a Mexican wrestler. Hey, that's cool

83
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,820
I like I like the luchadors. He's actually pretty fast. I've watched some gameplay footage of

84
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,260
him

85
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,980
Now Rufus, so that guy is he's pretty fat. He kind of reminds me a lot of oh

86
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,220
God, who is the character that they just added in Tekken 6 the one that was really like Bob?

87
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,420
Yeah, it kind of looks like Bob but with like a ponytail and just like he's got amazing

88
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,880
Gut physics. He looks like Jack Black and nacho libre

89
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:47,240
DJ janae in chat says king hippo is the king of fat dude characters and games. Yes true statement

90
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Whatever happened to king hippo. Oh

91
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,380
Okay, so I'm looking at this el fuerte. Mm-hmm, and he's actually pretty cool

92
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,120
He fights very much in a from sort of a vega style I'm thinking but it is very

93
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:12,480
Yeah, dark Tetsuya and Chad it throws back to another Capcom classic says he reminds me of one of the characters in slam masters

94
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,440
Remember Saturday night slam masters. Oh my god. This guy is it was fun

95
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,320
Hideously fast. He actually surmised me. Who was that guy from art of fighting that would throw cookies. Oh

96
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,100
God, I don't remember where the green outfit and suspenders. No, that was a

97
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:34,300
That was that was Chang that was a fatal fury fatal. Fury was hairy was named Chang. Yeah something something

98
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
Yeah, I know you're talking about

99
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:42,020
Yes, he threw cookies Rufus is kind of like if I kept eating and eating and eating and eating then became a fighter

100
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,540
He he he he has jiggle. He has belly jiggle

101
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,260
Don't you see?

102
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
He looks like pom-pom in

103
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,060
A home star runner. All right, a lot lots of diverse characters apparently coming to Street Fighter 4

104
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,700
I'm kind of excited by this. It sounds like there's a lot of people in Street Fighter 4

105
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,660
I mean not only do you have the original fighters and I have some of these new people too

106
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,700
We have the crevice and Viper, you know other people we've heard about in previous shows

107
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,980
So Street Fighter 4 is gonna be a good time. Yeah, I hope now the question but the question is will it blend?

108
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,260
Well, it blends maybe I don't know if Rufus can fit in the blender

109
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,420
Now this is interesting and you know, once again goes to show you that

110
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,900
The Sony platforms are just not

111
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
Not that safe against hackers

112
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,220
Apparently though there's been a tool that's been developed

113
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,640
called ps3 proxy and what this program has done is actually allowed people to

114
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,480
Be able to download the PlayStation home beta without actually having to participate in the beta. So they're able to

115
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,720
Modify a few files that they've downloaded from a server to allow them to download the beta even though it's not available to them

116
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,320
Word is right now though that you're unable to actually play the beta

117
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,840
But there has been some video of people that have been able to play the beta

118
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,960
Despite the fact that it was previously thought you couldn't but either way though

119
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,960
The thought is that it's gonna be public pretty soon anyways

120
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,560
So might as well just wait a few weeks, you know for it to come out

121
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,140
But in the meantime though, it's very interesting though that you can download it as it you know

122
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,700
It's not that difficult from what I was reading into I just haven't gone around to actually trying it yet

123
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:35,140
Where is freaking home already? I mean they've been talking about this for over a year now, you know

124
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,580
And we have yet to really see much more than screenshots

125
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,020
Well, that's it's probably hanging out with spore and I'm sorry, but that's the same do them forever

126
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,700
You know what PlayStation I have you know, and I'm not gonna just dig on place, you know

127
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:57,060
Sony with this but the PlayStation 3 they've been like touting a lot of features as they say they haven't arrived yet like home

128
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:03,800
You know, there are new games like hell mill yourself for even going as far as like Final Fantasy 13

129
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,740
Which is not scheduled to be out here for a few years now

130
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,020
It's just like stuff like this. They're like, oh, hey. Yeah, this says it's coming like coming

131
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,000
It's right around the corner, but really it's not right around the corner

132
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,780
You know and even Microsoft's kind of guilty of this too with the whole XNA thing

133
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,660
Yeah, that's cool that they showed us that little snippet around

134
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:31,180
You know game developers conference in that kind of time, but once it actually coming out not for a while

135
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,340
So that's kind of lame and then you know with Nintendo and the whole WiiWare service

136
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,900
Yeah, they've been teasing that for a long time and I good point. I guess it's not just Sony

137
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,920
It's just easy to pick on Sony for whatever reason. Well, yeah, but at least they've given us a date on WiiWare of sorts

138
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,700
Yeah, I guess I could always put it back. I don't think they will this one

139
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,420
I mean WiiWare is out now in Japan it is out. But what's the kind of release schedule? What are we looking at?

140
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,700
Okay, they release like say eight games or something. How many months do we have to wait for the next games that come out?

141
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,700
I mean, it's not like a typical Nintendo timeframes

142
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,820
Not like live arcade where three months for a B title another three months for a B title in about nine months

143
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
You'll get your a-list title

144
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,180
We have a spider in the studio and it's driving me crazy

145
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,900
I need Loki to do something about that or you are you bug phobic step on it kill it

146
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,500
You know what? I hate worse than spiders. What's that? Mosquito Hawks?

147
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,300
That's what we get for having that door open to get some of the cool air in here

148
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,380
Mosquito Hawks that moment of total randomness brought to you by orange lounge radio back to the gaming news

149
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,140
And we are one less spider in the studio. Sorry spider

150
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,540
Sega

151
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,560
things things aren't too good at Sega sadly Sega Racing Studio has

152
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,660
Closed they're gone. They had more than 60 employees at one point

153
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,020
They've really only created one title since they formed in 2005

154
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,100
Sega closed it

155
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,720
There was this comment that Sega gave to next-gen quote

156
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:06,380
the decision is part of a review of Sega's Western Development Studios to ensure that each studio is profitable entity in its own right and

157
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:13,460
Unfortunately, the Sega Racing Studios five-year plan would not result in a successful return for the Sega business moving forward

158
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,180
Or you could probably just look at the sales of Sega rally revo because that's the one game they made

159
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,500
and sadly, I I think it was just

160
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:28,260
Especially in racing. It's so competitive right now with these next-gen systems. There are so many racing games out there right now, right?

161
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,420
I mean look at what they have on you know, these next-gen systems, you know

162
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,860
They got it's just on the Xbox 360. You had games like full auto test drive for za

163
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,700
Burnout I can go on and on for a dirt, you know, just tons and tons of racing games

164
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
This is just a very competitive market

165
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:52,540
So that's that's two studios closed in a week sad both racing games. Mm-hmm

166
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,180
Yaris was a game. Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't really call Yaris

167
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,420
I wouldn't put that quite on the same level as Sega

168
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,820
But it's just kind of like potential you would think potential by the way going back to something

169
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,460
We were bringing up a little bit earlier

170
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:10,740
I know I'm a little late on this but the Rob D is a fighting game guru and he said the character green guy throws cookies

171
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,020
Chang's Shinzan that was it

172
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:19,420
Chang's Shinzan. There it is. Couldn't remember the full name. We had a fatal fury special at my school

173
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,160
I never played Chang anyway, it was all about Kim kap won

174
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,420
Actually, I have to agree with you. It was him and my were always the ones I'd use and Yuri's butt attack

175
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
She had butt attack and that was great

176
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,540
Any character who attacks with her butt except there is a fighting game

177
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,200
That has a character that fights with her butt and the game kind of sucked and that was the Sailor Moon super s fighting game

178
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,340
So which is which was the first game I've ever imported

179
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,120
It was a Sailor Moon fighting game. Nice. Very nice. So now that we have this little tidbit about me

180
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,600
Going back over as far as the rumor mill is concerned

181
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,040
There has been rumored a a

182
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,600
New

183
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,840
Ace attorney game to be coming out

184
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:11,520
Um that has been called um, Gakuten Saiban perfect prosecutor and it should be starring

185
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,600
Edgeworth

186
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,840
objection

187
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
overruled

188
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,480
Well, you said it was a rumor so I thought I would object but I

189
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,520
You know these people that love the ace attorney series love the ace attorney series

190
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,040
I have a friend who is sucked into the series. There's like manga and everything

191
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,820
Yeah, um, but um, they're actually the it came across from some scans in Famitsu

192
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,520
So, um, you're you remember Shane used to come on this program a bit a long time ago. I don't remember mr.

193
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,120
High musical I'm reminding the listeners right me glattov so and so on who used to work in on mr. High school music

194
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,760
Okay, he played he plays World of Warcraft with us, right and he joins ventrilo the chatting

195
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,040
You know how like in ventrilo whenever it joins you have that little robotic voice that says, you know

196
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,680
Rob has joined the server you can put in whatever you know name you want his thing whenever he joins the server goes

197
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,200
Apollo justice is sexy has connected

198
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,640
Just cracks me up, but I'm telling you people that are really into Apollo justice are really into it

199
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,100
Hey something a lot of us are into this week is rom check fail a couple weeks ago a little independent game called a rom

200
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:24,680
Check fail swept gaming blogs everywhere rom check fail takes several classic video games such as Super Mario Brothers

201
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,520
Asteroids pac-man throws them all into a blender basically resulting in unique and nostalgic

202
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Gameplay basically kind of what you do in this game. Is that one minute you might be

203
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,000
Zelda in a Mario level and you're trying to stab the asteroids with your sword

204
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,680
It would be link, but then the next minute well, you know what I mean, but then the next minute you are

205
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,280
You're you're in the asteroids level and then suddenly you're pac-man

206
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,520
You have to find the dot on the screen to eat the things from kicks are flying around the screen

207
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,420
But when you find it they turn into blue ghosts. It's excellent. I love it

208
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,200
The man behind rom check fail is Farb's and we got in touch with him this week

209
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,760
And we're excited to have him on the show tonight, so let's go to the phones all the way to Australia

210
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,280
Where Farb's is from let's get him on the line all right. Hello Farb's are you there?

211
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,620
Hi, yeah, hey, how you doing Farb's?

212
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,620
I'm not bad not bad all right

213
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,260
So you're the guy that wrote rom check fail was this is was it a solo effort

214
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,620
Did you do this all yourself or how did this happen?

215
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,740
Yeah, yeah, no usually I work alone um

216
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,340
It's just easier that way coordinating the project between multiple people way too hard especially when you want to do something a bit silly

217
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,900
How long did it take you to do the whole thing?

218
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,620
Well, I'm not sure if you saw but it was part of the video game named generator contest over

219
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,060
So so the whole thing had to be completed in three weeks, which is why it's it's pretty small game

220
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,180
But you know that's why wow it's very impressive considering. It was done in three weeks

221
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,540
I I had heard it was it was like the the winner didn't you end up winning that competition too? I?

222
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,660
Did I did so well congratulations? Well well deserved how did it get from?

223
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,900
Competition rules to this finished product like whether where there are certain rules that made you want to go in this direction of developing

224
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
This game or what happened I?

225
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,460
Think you tapped into a little bit of controversy there because the the contest had one rule that you had to use this video game

226
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,660
named generator

227
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,580
Websites come up with a name for your game, and then make that and that's something I didn't actually do so

228
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,260
What happened you get a really bad name out of it or something?

229
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,980
No, I know what happened was I am I kind of started in that direction, so I started sort of looking at the generator

230
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,820
Running it a couple times coming up with different names having to think about how it works and thinking about ways that I could

231
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:47,380
Hook in an exciting game with that right and what I saw pretty quickly was that the generator was

232
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,220
It was coming up with a couple of different concepts and just kind of mashing them together

233
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,380
Which if you played ROM check file you'll see is certainly a part of ROM check file

234
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,020
So anyway, I saw that and I thought hey

235
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,460
You know what would be awesome is a game that actually generates lots of the games that come out of the generator

236
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,340
so you know

237
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,540
That's pretty funny. It's kind of it's telling you through all these games

238
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,220
It's like you throw all these games in a blender and out comes this so it

239
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,620
Wasn't necessarily that you had the idea to begin with the the blending of the names kind of inspired the blended game idea

240
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,460
Yeah, totally so I was going to do stuff that actually came out of the generator

241
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,500
But I realized possibly also with the help of some advice from a friend that

242
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:34,540
When somebody sees an emu on the screen and and there's a dragonfly, but I don't know what that means right whereas

243
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,980
If they see Mario, and they see some space invaders. They totally get that immediately

244
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,500
Well, I don't know the first time I played ROM check fail. It took me a minute to get it

245
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,580
But but just imagine how much would have been if you didn't actually know what the characters were all the ways that they

246
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
interacted with each other so

247
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,220
Not only was it kind of tapping into the whole nostalgia vibe

248
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,700
But it but it also communicated to the player much more quickly what the hell was going on

249
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,980
I guess that's a very good point because you know eventually kind of figure out okay if I'm pac-man right now

250
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,660
I better eat this dot before I try to touch something or I'm gonna be in trouble. So yeah, do you think that's right?

251
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,140
Whereas if you were a penguin and you had to go pick up a water lily before you could eat things you

252
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,220
You would never think of that

253
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,980
Unless I was playing the penguin and water lily game. I don't know

254
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,060
Maybe it would be in the title

255
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,580
Do you think it's that nostalgia is the part of the reason why this game is just kind of like spread like wildfire amongst all

256
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,620
The gaming blogs and the internet and kind of like caught on I think that has helped a lot. Yeah, um

257
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,260
Which is a shame because that's not really what the game was meant to be about but you know, I'll take it

258
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,900
What what is the game meant to be about? Well, whenever I make a game, I usually think about it

259
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,220
Just starting with a gameplay concept first. So I think about the way that the game's gonna play

260
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,660
I don't really think too much about what it looks like or the narrative or anything like that

261
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,620
And this game like I was saying was about

262
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,340
matching different kind of

263
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,300
Archetypal characters together just kind of throwing them in a scene saying deal with it

264
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,740
Um, what was the question again? No, that's okay. Um, what like

265
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,560
Um, I guess we were talking about the that is spreading along the blogs and it's kind of like wildfire and the nostalgia

266
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:19,100
Is the nostalgia part of you know, why this game you think is caught on so so popular?

267
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,740
Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, I think I think that's half of it. Um

268
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,220
Because I mean you look around you you're gonna find a lot of games that that are

269
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,660
You're gonna find a lot of games that that take mario sprites and chuck them in a game or or that kind of thing

270
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,580
Um, so it's not not unique in in the first thing

271
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,460
What's largely unique is the way that it uses them and the fact that there is a playable game underneath

272
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,020
Absolutely. Did you have to recreate all of the the the mario and I I don't know if this might be a controversial thing

273
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,940
I'm asking so you can feel free to say no comment

274
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,380
But did you have to recreate all those sprites and the music and everything or did you were you able to kind of?

275
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,420
I don't know. I guess borrow from the games that were already out there

276
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,820
How much of this did you have to kind of build from scratch?

277
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,380
uh, well

278
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,820
Strangely enough this actually took most of my time like recreating the the gameplay interactions and things

279
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,020
was very quick when I was just using a bunch of squares, but

280
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,140
Once I started looking at the the proper sprites from all the games and the sounds and everything

281
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
It was a huge process to um

282
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,860
To pull it all together and it came from whatever source I could find first to be honest

283
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,340
So there's there's a lot of sprite rip pages that I used. So thanks to everybody who put those together

284
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:35,180
Um, all the music came from different people's websites where they they've sort of re-orchestrated tunes

285
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,780
Which I then tweaked a little bit to make them sound a little bit more like each other

286
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,260
And cut them up and pasted them together. So it was

287
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,940
I like to think of it as a collaborative effort from the entire internet retro gaming community

288
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,340
I was gonna say i'm thinking this isn't my name's on the credits. This isn't just like a hodgepodge of a game

289
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,580
It's also kind of a mixture of all these different contributions that are already out there on the internet

290
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,660
So some guy who ripped zelda sprites might have helped with this game and didn't even know it

291
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,060
Um, yep. Yep, since this game's kind of spread all around the internet, you know

292
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,340
You gotta love the way the internet kind of reacts to things and i'm sure your email box has been starting to get some

293
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,140
Emails about rom check fail if you've gotten any kind of like crazy feedback about the game or what's like the craziest thing

294
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
You've gotten in response to the game

295
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,100
Uh, actually I haven't really got much back from it, which is which is a bit surprising

296
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,380
Um, I think a lot of people play the game through a direct link

297
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,660
So they don't even see my website and people who do even like pick it up by going through my website

298
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:35,260
Don't don't think to email me. So it's been a bit quiet. I mean the the tig source feedback threads have been great

299
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,420
um

300
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,260
But unless i've explicitly asked people to talk about my game it's usually been a bit quiet

301
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,220
Well, that's a damn shame. We need to get some of our listeners to send

302
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,420
Love for making this game for free as part of a competition. So listeners send farb's little love

303
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,900
Where's the website they can get in touch with you? Oh, uh,

304
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,820
www.farb's.org f a r b s excellent

305
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,340
Do you have any uh future projects you can talk about things that might be coming to the website soon?

306
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,340
Because you have some other games already on the website, too

307
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,740
This isn't the only thing you've ever done you have some other games as well

308
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,620
But um, do you have anything in the future? You might want to give us some hints about uh

309
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,580
I would love to but unfortunately i'm still deciding what i'm gonna do next

310
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:20,540
I mean i've got i've always got about a dozen ideas kind of floating around bumping into each other and it usually takes

311
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:27,660
Something to actually push me to put something together as a game. So the uh, the vgng compo was great for me because I I had

312
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,260
You know some concept about games that I wanted to make

313
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,100
Suddenly I had a three-week deadline to actually do something and so I got something done

314
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,780
Whereas now i'm back in that phase of sort of thinking. Oh, I don't know what I want to do next

315
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,260
So there will be games coming I can promise you that

316
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,420
But I have no idea which ones excellent. Well here, you know something we at orange launch radio

317
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,580
Have been talking about our dream game for a long time, you know

318
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,820
I'll just kind of throw it out there if you can make a game with cats wielding lasers at each other

319
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,820
Might be an amazing game. So just give me something to think about maybe for the sequel

320
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,180
Now something we always ask all of our guests that come on the program because you know, we're all gamers

321
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,660
What kind of video games have you been playing this week?

322
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,460
Have you been playing independent games you a console gamer pc gamer? What kind of games you've been playing this week?

323
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,100
Uh, this week's been very quiet for me. I've uh,

324
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,740
I've been a bit busy. So I haven't haven't been able to get into any massive titles. So

325
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,780
Mostly for me it's been just sort of picking up indie titles because usually you can kind of pick them up have a bit of

326
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,420
A play and then and then put them down again because they're not very large

327
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,100
Um other than that bit of smash brothers friend of mine imported it so we were actually able to play it which is nice

328
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,820
Awesome, nothing big very cool. Do you find yourself drawn to other indie games?

329
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,980
Do you like to kind of sample what else is out there in the indie world?

330
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,500
Yeah, I like to but but like I said, I mean i'm interested in gameplay mechanics and you're going to see a lot more variation

331
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,980
in that kind of stuff in indie games, but

332
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,900
also

333
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,820
They're they're small and disposable and that that's really great when you've you know, got 10 minutes free

334
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,620
Uh, it's a lot better than thinking. Oh i've got 10 minutes free. I'm going to start morrowind that that doesn't add up

335
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,780
Exactly, um, I got one more question for you and this might be opening a big can of worms

336
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,900
But it's something we've been kind of talking about a little bit in the past on this program

337
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,100
And that would be kind of the future of uh console, you know gaming as we see these more

338
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:15,900
Independent scene friendly things start to open up such as xna and we wear and things like that

339
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,620
From your viewpoint as somebody who's been kind of developing independent games. What do you do? Do you think that?

340
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,940
Xna and the these things that are going to make uh console development a little more accessible to the indie developer

341
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,420
Do you think this is going to be the next big thing in gaming? Do you think this is going to take off or do you think?

342
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,500
Yeah, this pc is always where it's really going to be at

343
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,060
Well, I think uh the the the xna thing that they're coming up with where pretty much any game can get

344
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:49,260
Distributed is is definitely going to be interesting. Um, but in that sense, I think it's just going to really look a lot more like pc

345
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:57,260
I don't think we're ever going to really hit that that kind of wonderland that all all indie game developers

346
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,860
Hope will one day open up where you know, you can make a game in three months by yourself

347
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:08,300
And push it out on a console and suddenly make millions and millions of dollars. I mean those those opportunities pop up occasionally

348
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
But they're extremely rare. So

349
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,220
I don't know. I I think it'll open up a bit more. I think it'll become a little bit more like pc

350
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
But I don't think we'll see any major changes

351
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,780
All right. Well farbs. Thanks so much for joining us all the way from australia tonight. We really appreciate it farbs

352
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,740
He is the man that wrote rom check fail it check him out

353
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:35,820
Www.farbz.org and you can download other games as well. Not just rom check fails. So check that out

354
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,220
Farbz, thanks so much for being with us tonight

355
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,260
All right. Cheers. All right. Take care

356
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,260
I I want to listen to him talk some more. That was really cool. Sorry. He's gone now

357
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:53,660
So yeah, but yeah, it's something about accents aren't isn't there but I I want I want I want laser capture

358
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,860
And and he's quite talented. I mean rom check. I was very surprised

359
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,860
I mean, I kind of knew going into that interview that rom check fail was done by pretty much one guy

360
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,740
But that's still very impressive, you know, i'm always impressed by some of the levels of talent out there

361
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,300
Well, best of luck to farbz and thanks for taking the kind of time to come on the show. We appreciate it

362
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,540
Are you a big fan of rom check fail loki? I think you were the one that showed that to me first played it a bit

363
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,460
Yeah, I don't know. It's one of those games that you can play for just a little bit and then

364
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,500
Leave it for a while. It's like the game that made me go

365
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,500
What is that music and then I realized it was marble madness. It's like it's like

366
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,380
WarioWare type of thing like as long as you could just play for like a little bit and it's like total crack and fun

367
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,820
You're like, okay. It's like it's a good like micro game like the c1 that it was just all like nintendo stuff like, you know

368
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,980
mega man with mario's all the

369
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,500
Well, he might hit copyright issues with that. I mean, well, I guess he already is. Yeah, who cares? That's true

370
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,140
Okay, make something for we wear or something. That's why you need to do it like all underground, you know

371
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,060
And don't say who you are and just throw it out there on like, you know, the bit torrent

372
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,620
Well, I would gather farb's is probably not his real name. Well, I'm just saying speculation

373
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,940
I'm just saying though instead of like having a website and stuff because if you do it all underground and stuff like that

374
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:06,940
They can't really stop yet. I mean, especially if you just kind of throw it out there, you know, just let it catch the current

375
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,380
All right. Well, we want to thank farms again for taking the time to come on the show

376
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:17,020
All the time away from developing new games for us more crack for us later on. All right, let's get back to the show

377
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,940
Later on. All right. Let's get back into the gaming news. Loki take it away. All right. So here's another rumor that's coming around

378
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,860
That's not a big surprise

379
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,140
But um, i'm interested in to see that they're actually kind of going this route or maybe thinking going this route

380
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:38,220
Um rumor is that microsoft course is good looking into creating a wiimote like device for the xbox

381
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,500
360

382
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,860
Uh, the motion controller is going to be codenamed newton

383
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,260
and uh

384
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,900
No word on what exactly this might be

385
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,580
Uh something though

386
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:56,700
it will use a like a usb powered sensor bar and it will possibly have rumble motors as well as um,

387
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,660
a microphone built in for voice activated games, so

388
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,740
It's interesting that they might be going this route and the same way I kind of think you know

389
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,940
It's not a little copy cat-ish a little bit, but everybody kind of copies everybody at some point. So

390
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,940
And I know microsoft has had

391
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,380
Not great success trying to tap that family market and stuff that nintendo has but

392
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,020
Well seen it hasn't done bad for them

393
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,980
I mean, you know, even though amongst the hardcore we kind of all turn our noses at it and go it's kind of dumb

394
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,260
But apparently it's been doing fairly well for them. So who knows?

395
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,860
I don't think as well as like say we sports or something like that. No, I don't think well

396
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,180
I don't you just never know with microsoft

397
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:44,700
I know with microsoft microsoft kind of has a way of taking it at somebody else's idea and kicking it up a notch

398
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,020
You know what? I mean, but can you imagine though just if you will like motion controlled games with

399
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,180
360s graphics. Yeah, I mean that'd be fucking awesome. I don't know. Uh, what do you think dark sakura? Do you think uh,

400
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,980
Do you think it could be successful motion control on the 360 or and I open this up to chat, too

401
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,180
What do you guys think of it?

402
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,700
Do you think it could be successful in the 360 or is it gonna feel like a cheap knockoff of wii?

403
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,900
I really don't think it would be that difficult to integrate

404
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:14,460
Into um, the 360 because really all you need is just the uh, the input device, you know

405
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,100
The the thing you need your sensor bar, of course

406
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,340
Oh there went my power plug again, um, I don't think that it's it's going to

407
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,780
I really don't think that it's going to be

408
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,820
That sort of cheap knockoff thing, but I think people are going to have a preconceived notion

409
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,620
About how it's supposed to work because they have this experience with the wii

410
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,940
You know, I think it's really all about the games

411
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,140
It really is, you know, depending on what they release with it

412
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,660
And if they've been paying any attention to the wii they're going to take something like wii sports or carnival games and really kick it

413
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,460
Up a notch and uh, it might do very well. This is a chance to either sink or bail with it

414
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:59,260
I mean, I mean sink or swim with it. I mean and if they swim they'll be you know, because Microsoft they'll be walking on water

415
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,980
Comments from chat room chat.orangelaundry.com

416
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,100
RawstealUT is predicting that newton much like xbox live vision will have incredibly limited use

417
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,780
That is the problem. I mean at least nintendo built their whole console around the concept so, you know, the game's integrated

418
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,100
VxjasonXV our fearless webmaster says Microsoft wants to tap that

419
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:25,420
Gerardimo says I want motion control res. Oh or space channel 5 does come to xbox live arcade do want motion control

420
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:32,940
Choo, choo, you never know it'll be interesting. So I just you said that I was already starting to think of samba

421
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,460
D'amigo the one we with the posing well, they are doing that

422
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,060
I know that's what I started thinking of doing your bizarro little poses

423
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,740
Uh juiceton says imagine a game that requires the camera and the motion controller

424
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,220
Good idea, but imagine the highly limited audience that's going to reach unless xbox then puts out a you know

425
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,580
Another bundle that comes with both which I guess is is very possible. I don't know

426
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Who knows?

427
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:05,500
So, uh, we'll continue on with the gaming news and I want to talk about metal gear solid online, you know over here

428
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,140
Uh, you had to pre-order the game in order to get the metal gear online demo, but guess what?

429
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:17,260
In the european playstation store metal gear online premiere beta free download on the playstation store

430
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,380
April 17th to may 6th in europe

431
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,500
So if you live in europe, you don't even have to pre-order although I imagine you know logic

432
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,860
You know, usually this is the type of thing that would make us go woohoo free things are awesome

433
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,220
But then again, I go I imagine most metal gear fans

434
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:38,300
Probably pre-ordered the game anyway, so I can't imagine there's that many people but at the same time

435
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,300
There might be some casual fans like for instance

436
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,140
You know if if this were happening in the us I go

437
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,620
Hmm free beta i'll download it and check it out. I may not be into metal gear that much but hey if it's free

438
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,620
That gives me incentive to take a look

439
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:56,860
Right rob what imagine technical, um, uh, the imagine babies. No

440
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,100
Imagine not stumbling over your words imagine

441
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,940
Uh tactical espionage action sounds like fun though

442
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,580
babies

443
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
babies with babies

444
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,020
Yes a tactical espionage baby game metal gear bailey

445
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,500
A tactical espionage baby game metal gear bailey metal gear babies

446
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,020
Maybe that'll be you know, because they have the flash forward in metal gear 4

447
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,700
Maybe that'll be a metal gear 5 flash backwards. By the way, the beta is running from april 21st to may 6th

448
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,460
Uh, which by the way happens to be one day less than we have it in north america. Hmm

449
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,060
Something is afoot maybe all the uh

450
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,340
Maybe all the european fandom over the years for sony is paying off. Who knows anyhow?

451
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:46,060
Your fandom pays off every week when you send us emails to our address mailbag at orange laundry.com

452
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:51,740
We love getting your emails and uh, just yes, we do dark sakura. Just say it. Yes, we do

453
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,380
Even though we've moved over to all games.com now

454
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,700
We move the mailbag with us and it's still the same email address mailbag at orange laundry.com

455
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,660
Let's open up the mailbag and check out some of the email that came in since last week's show dark. Sakura

456
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,420
Dive in head first. Will you into the mailbag and pull out some of your favorites? No, because there might be an anvil in there or something

457
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,460
Or a spider. Oh, okay. So

458
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
um first, um

459
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,780
Email of the evening is from trisha licious

460
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:27,900
That's a cool name trisha licious. I hate to say it. Oh, i'm gonna i'm gonna make us lose a fan

461
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,140
But it does sound like a stripper name

462
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:37,980
Dear olr, just picture the guns and roses in the background now taking the stage trisha licious on my ipod

463
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,860
I thought I would ask you about a recent game

464
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:47,100
I purchased and I had to buy it from an online retailer after reading a review in game informer magazine about pinball hall of fame

465
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:52,060
The williams collection which received a high rating and for only being 30 bucks. I knew I had to have it

466
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,380
I proceeded to my local gaming shop expecting them to have the game since it was

467
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,300
Reviewed in their magazine, but nothing was on the shelf or listed in their computer database

468
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,180
When I finally got the game after buying it online, I lo- I loaded it up and started playing

469
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,540
Phf on my wii is the best pinball I have played on a pc or console

470
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,280
I wanted to try to get the word out that this game really kicks major butt as a pinball simulator

471
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,780
I love it and I want to make sure those all those who also love pinball to give it a try

472
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,500
Now I want to go play these tables all over again if I can find them at a local arcade

473
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,240
The local arcade love to you all huggies trishalicious

474
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,460
Pinball is awesome

475
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:38,860
Pinball is the best ever, you know, I downloaded a new table for pinball fx on xbox live this week the uh, buccaneer table

476
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,140
Yeah, uh, but I didn't get a chance to play because I was down with that rocky and bullwinkle table

477
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,340
but I got sidetracked my whole fantasy star universe thing, but I

478
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,100
Trishalish is not the first person to point out that that's a fun game

479
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:55,260
But I bet you especially would enjoy that you pinball whore really? Yes. Good times. Yes. All right

480
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:02,060
How can they release a pinball collection a williams pinball collection and us not have it just just just checking?

481
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,620
Okay, then. I'm

482
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:12,220
What I was shaking my head anyway next email is

483
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:18,000
Is kamatari's forever is who that is

484
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,400
Hey, olr. Love your show been listening for about a month and one and wondering a few things

485
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,360
Is the ferret still there from your transition to all games?

486
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,120
That answer your question

487
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,600
That would make me sad if it were shipped away into a box

488
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,280
I've also heard rumors that konami will make a ddr 10th anniversary game sometime around this or next year

489
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,040
Could that be plausible due to licensing fees and whatnot? Just want to know

490
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,640
I could see it being plausible since they're probably running out of ideas for new ddr games anyways

491
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,360
Yeah, there's not like too much they can do to revise. So let's put a new ddr game with all the classic konami songs

492
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,480
Wait, that's like every other ddr game

493
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,080
What I think that they should do if they did like an anniversary edition is to have you be able to choose your mode

494
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,440
That you play in so you can actually load up

495
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,620
the very first ddr and have to do your little jumps around for your codes and shit and have it all be

496
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:21,400
Unvivid and you know instead have like second mix mode where you have dance battle pop-up because you know dance battle was the best thing

497
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
about about second mix and

498
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:30,820
You know, you should do stuff like that like a third mix have paint mode or something, you know stuff like an SSR

499
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,420
Whoops

500
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,420
Or you can dance to this song

501
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,420
What a hoe down? Anyway

502
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,420
Hope that's what I get for leaving things running

503
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,420
Can I be, do you have something to say about

504
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,220
It would not be a first show on all games if I didn't screw up somehow. So there you have it

505
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,720
Do you have something to say about the ditter?

506
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:53,140
Look, I've been saying forever if ddr wants to evolve the game needs to be they need to scrap all their old code

507
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,540
Rebuild the game from the ground up

508
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,880
Honestly make it look like guitar hero at this point

509
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,380
I think that's the best way to make a catch on here in the US. I hate to say it

510
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,780
How about okay? How about this? You just totally ignore like all the like tutorials and

511
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:12,020
Get rid of quest mode for the love of God quest mode is

512
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,700
Crap or redo quest I think quest mode has potential to be good

513
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,780
No, no, but not in its current form quest mode is crap what they need to have bring challenge mode back

514
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,700
That's fine. The challenge modes. I think are a lot more fun

515
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,740
or

516
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,020
Challenging than quest mode quest mode is like okay play allows on go. Oh

517
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,020
Oh fun

518
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:38,060
Nothing like repetition. I just think if they want the DER to continue they should you know remit

519
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,980
I've said it for years. They need to make DDR take it from being cooperative and making competitive

520
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:48,980
But that's just me or have like new modifiers that are song specific that like certain things happen in the song

521
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:54,320
Maybe integrated with like, you know videos or something that are playing like the arrows fall down different ways or something like that

522
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,700
I mean, which would be pretty cool like different

523
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,780
themes

524
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,340
All right, next email next email is

525
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
As soon as it loads up

526
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,140
Next email comes to us from Harvey. Oh

527
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,900
Sorry, it comes just from a poorly formatted email. Um, I'm

528
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,040
Okay, I'm just gonna say Harvey was the last name because they put their full name in there. So that's what I'm gonna say

529
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,220
Um, hey, what's up, Ol R. I was wondering what do you think about Sony saying DualShock?

530
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:29,740
Wouldn't fit in a 6-axis controller and now it's there. How ironic

531
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,620
they didn't ever say it wouldn't fit just they

532
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,040
Couldn't do it at the same time with the tilt and it's so last

533
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,420
Yeah, I mean and it's actually the same shell. In fact, there's actually spots for the two rumble motors. So

534
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:50,540
That's bullshit. Do you think that redesigning the PSN store will affect the amount of content that is bought?

535
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:57,260
Will you guys be buying any games from the new we wear section next month? Also do like 365 give dark soccer a cookie. I

536
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,100
Will make it one of my goals as a gamer to give her a cookie

537
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,220
Dude cookies are great, but you have to get it to me by next weekend

538
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,540
Because it's your birthday. It's my birthday. That's right. I mean, whatever I want to

539
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
cookies and booze

540
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,660
Life is five did not give you a cookie. In fact, they gave me a migraine

541
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,660
Uh

542
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
Yeah, I

543
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,820
Want to they owe me a cookie and then they owe Rob money as far as we wear. Yes

544
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,540
I'm hoping there's some movies or something gameplay videos that make its way to the US sites

545
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,540
I can learn a little more about these games

546
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,380
Than just having to take a leap of faith. You know, I mean that game just like well, yeah

547
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,820
Okay, maybe there's certain cases where I would take a leap of faith and like I already know I want that. Dr

548
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,500
Mario game especially it has like the online and everything but you know some of those old ones like even like Final Fantasy

549
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,740
I'm kind of like

550
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,140
Honest, I don't know if I have the room on my Wii hard drive to fit that stuff

551
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,580
You know how many freaking virtual console games I have a sad amount sad amount

552
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,860
well

553
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,020
This person has listed gamer goals and I have to read some of these because I have to respond to some of them

554
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:07,140
Okay gamer goals. Yes. There's 15 goals. Are you to read them all Phyllis is not in order Oh

555
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,140
One be a guest on attack of the show either in person or webcam viewer. Why?

556
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,500
You know rated be a guest on x-play in person. Why?

557
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,780
Overrated special guests don't have guests anymore on x-play. Oh

558
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,460
Well, I guess they don't have viewers anymore. I guess on

559
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,780
live viewers

560
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,700
Special guest on a gamer podcast. Oh, well, our gamer tech radio all games radio IGN EGM

561
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,080
Oh XM game scoop beyond or three red lights all of those

562
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:41,800
I might be tricky come to yeah getting on all ours easy. Yeah, just show up or you know

563
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,960
Call us on the skype line. It's very easy to get on the show same thing with all games interactive

564
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,240
At least they do they do their phones are open the whole time

565
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,040
I don't know how they do it because they keep their phones open the whole show if we did that we get derailed even faster

566
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,680
And we already do but uh, you know, they have their phones open all day

567
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,360
We've been on that show and it's very tangenty too, but it's fun. Yes

568
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,200
For go to e3. You don't want to go there anymore. I

569
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:12,400
Do speak for yourself. Well, I want to but I don't think that it's e3 is not what it was

570
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,320
So just to let you know. Yeah. Okay miss got invited last year and didn't go I

571
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,040
Had other things to do

572
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,720
Have the game room in my future home. That's always a good idea battle it out over

573
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:31,840
Major league gaming and a battle out at major league gaming. Okay, get my degree in video game design

574
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,560
I'm good. This is one of the ones I wanted to talk about. I

575
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,480
Have a friend who's a game designer and she has a math degree

576
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,720
So just a word of warning you'd want to go in programming or math

577
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,820
Not something not or go in the art side of it and go into you know

578
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,720
Graphic design or digital art just letting you know

579
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:58,160
I don't think there's actually anything an actual video game design some folks in chat room are commenting on this whole e3 thing

580
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:04,200
And Gerardo most said I want to be a guest on xplay four years ago. Justin says

581
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,400
E3 is lame sauce now. It's all about packs. I'm oh god. I hope I hope I get to go to packs this year

582
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,680
I think I'm gonna go I want to go I think they're supposed to be like a big all games like

583
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,440
Thing like Voltron thing happening at packs. So I definitely would go. I know it's gonna be hot

584
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,800
um

585
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
What was the other thing I want to see?

586
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,360
Recruit number zero seven four five says e3 was cool before they fucked it over

587
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,480
By the way, ask someone how to change your neck so we can give you your proper name

588
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:37,240
Black wolf says last year's e3 was the best e3 I went to and I've been to 11 of them

589
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,760
Lucky you Bobby, but I think the whole point though is that this person might not since we're on all games now

590
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
Are we gonna get into the e3 this year?

591
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,880
Frickin hope so. Yeah an article. Yeah, I know. We'll write articles. I'm a good writer

592
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,840
Anyway, um make a video game. Well, you'll need your design creds then

593
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,760
Review another company's video game you could do that if you got a blog

594
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,280
Travel to Japan and meet the people at Konami and Square Enix

595
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:12,100
Okay, go to New York and hang out with true homie the rage 65 scariest glow retro king grow

596
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:18,380
Why boy and others they are some of my friends on xbox live get my xbox 360 autographed by the guys over orange on radio

597
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,580
We could do that

598
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,120
We could we I need me a new xbox, you know

599
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,880
Several people have asked about the faceplates now. I'm I'm almost feeling like oh god

600
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,180
We're gonna have to come up with some way to do this for everybody who wants one

601
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,680
So what things like or at least get autographed pictures or something?

602
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,160
I never thought we'd be at that level where I cuz I totally feel like a picture of me

603
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,860
I don't know. Like don't you feel like a total like pompous asshole by say

604
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,160
What was I do have the sign pictures from was it that

605
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,320
Attack of the attack of the show. I think it was it still the screen

606
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,880
It was still the screen savers at that point

607
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,780
I think cuz I got my dad one cuz he liked the screen savers. Yeah. Yeah. Well

608
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,480
We'll figure we'll figure out how to do it

609
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,400
I've had somebody email my personal email that once one and you know Osfer was the guy I kind of started it

610
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,460
I know we will figure something out within the next couple weeks. I promise

611
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,840
So the last three yes, it's get a copy of Gears of War one and two autographed by Clippy B

612
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,060
Attend the University of Advanced Technology and give dark Sakura a cookie

613
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,300
Those are some you would be fulfilling the being on a show on a podcast and the giving me a cookie one at the same

614
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:37,320
Time and even the signature the autograph before you here in studio. I know we're awesome. Well, here's the thing

615
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,440
Here's the thing here. Where's this guy live? Did he say no if you live near Pax?

616
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,320
This might be your opportunity to do like three in one shot because you come to Pax you can be on our show

617
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,400
Give Jamie her cookie and we'll autograph whatever crap. I

618
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,000
Cookie on our packs. No asshole

619
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,840
I will eat the cookie on air as long as it does not have marshmallows or white chocolate in it or poison or poison

620
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:05,000
I don't know. I've poison maybe if it's tasty. All right, I will die for tasty food and I'm kidding

621
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,600
Um, anyway, um last email is um, thanks for switching to all games radio

622
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,640
I couldn't even listen to you live on life through 65. Anyway, I'm happy you switched seamlessly, but down to business

623
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,760
I want to ask you guys are you actually going to air the fuck show and when?

624
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,400
Looking forward to it. Thanks for your time Zeppelin. Yeah, remember that we were supposed to do the fuck show

625
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,040
Fucking hell, I don't know if that's actually gonna happen next week

626
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,560
I just because I'm gonna be out of town most of the weekend and it's just it's

627
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,560
We can't say when it's gonna happen. We got to pick a show and not tell you I like that idea

628
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,400
It should just fucking happen whenever the fuck I

629
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,360
The fuck show will happen. It won't happen next week, but it'll happen before summer

630
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,880
Is that weird? Yeah, we have to have one listener in on it just because they have to keep tally, but

631
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,960
Well, we'll tell dark Tetsuya or somebody, you know, who's been listening forever that we know is good gonna do a good job

632
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,920
Keeping tally. But yeah, if you don't know what the fuck show is you listen last week's show

633
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,680
It's this completely idiotic and stupid idea. We had that is so funny

634
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,580
It makes us giggle like in only places that what they play calm snap can

635
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,120
By the way, how much do I love the wiki editors?

636
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,780
The people that work on our wiki which is the orange lounge radio dot wiki calm

637
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,920
How much do I love them especially namely and a lot of people are getting in on it now?

638
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,160
But namely AJ mix and dark Tetsuya have been doing probably about 80% of the work. If not a little more. I love this

639
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,400
here's the summary you go in oops you go into the page that says dream games, right and

640
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Let's see. We have they're all accounted for

641
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,960
Sky's voice the game laser cats Loki's world of randomness rice princess presents boobies and pandas

642
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,960
forbidden Bomberman pen and paper

643
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,680
furries and then cosplayers versus furries and here's the new entry what they play calm snap a

644
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:03,960
Nintendo Wii game involving taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck

645
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,120
Beautiful a gold star for AJ mix who made that edit

646
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,360
You know

647
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,480
Someone else emailed something that I'm actually not going to

648
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,780
To really talk much about because I can't watch it while we're live, but someone sent me an engineer's guide to cats

649
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,320
Just the thought of that could be morbid

650
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:34,200
I think I'm just going well especially since Dan was showing Julie that South Park episode last night about sniffing cat butts and

651
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,920
so

652
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,400
That just sort of makes me think of that. I'll watch it later, but thank you whoever sent me an engineer's guide to cats

653
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,360
And that's it all right

654
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,760
If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange lounge radio.com is the place to go

655
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,860
Speaking of pen and paper the game Loki

656
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,080
Yes, speaking of pen and paper the game now

657
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:07,040
The game that we're referring to of course is lol never party alone. It's a multiplayer only game

658
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,200
Put out by age tech. It's actually kind of like

659
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,840
Pictionary sort of you basically draw

660
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,800
that will give you like I guess a

661
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,640
theme or a

662
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:25,840
statement or something like draw a funny clown, and then you have to draw a clown or something like that and

663
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,640
You know everybody draws it then one person votes on so it's like I guess

664
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,840
Pictionary meets apples apples, and then the winner gets a point

665
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,440
But the thing is as we said pen and paper of the game you can do this on pen and paper already

666
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,840
You don't need the buy game. Well unfortunately you won't be able to buy this game

667
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
in stores because

668
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,920
according to

669
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,620
The game's distributor age tech it will be available online only

670
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,680
so

671
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Yeah, you won't find this in stores

672
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,800
That's all right buy a tablet of paper and pens instead

673
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:08,720
Oh just what is it surprising if what if you're playing it in a store?

674
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,080
Then it will be in a store

675
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,700
You can't buy it in a store though

676
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,140
What if you were downloading it while you're in the store and paying the money while you're in that store?

677
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,240
No, it's not downloadable. It's just that you're buying you have to buy it from their online store

678
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,500
What if you're in there? Oh, what if you have your laptop, and you're at a store, okay? I'm picky

679
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:35,980
Just forget it. Do you really need this game? I mean, it's not like what else did they sell online only electroplankton?

680
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,500
Yeah, I like electroplankton. I know but exactly that was a game. That was worth buying online

681
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:46,620
Lol, I don't know. I don't know about that one. You know you know what the the alternative to

682
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,140
Lol is hmm. It's

683
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,020
No open canvas

684
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,520
picto chat

685
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,760
Well guys

686
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,340
We're going to get into another segment. We do here on orange launch radio once in a while

687
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,140
and I kind of gave away what's coming earlier based on the music, but

688
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,180
That's right when you hear that happy music. You know something really fucked up happened

689
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,980
And it's probably time to give out another olr stupid award

690
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,740
this time

691
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:23,220
18 year old Jean-Pierre, Orla, Orla wiz Orla wick wiz Orla wick is ol

692
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:27,260
or le w icz or le was wiz

693
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:33,260
I don't even know how to say that he is on trial right now for first degree premeditated murder

694
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:40,140
Guess what him and his friend did they sound so happy they ambushed 26 year old Daniel Sorensen in

695
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,540
November they stabbed him in the back and then sawed off his head and burned his body

696
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:49,060
This was not a video game. This is real life. It is not funny when it happens in real life

697
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:53,420
It's not as offensive as two guys kissing though

698
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,420
Don't even

699
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,420
Oh my god this guy looks psychotic

700
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:03,860
I know seriously okay, so the trial is going on right now, but here it is. Here's what happened the defense is

701
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,700
Blaming hitman that's right hitman

702
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,820
Here it is from a cnn report quote

703
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:16,500
They dealt with it a video game called hitman that he used to watch and it was a video game where you got

704
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:21,420
Impressions that you would kill somebody hit them from their backside where they were not aware. They were being killed

705
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,180
But I don't know that sounds a little more like manhunt to me but

706
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,460
Regardless this guy's an idiot

707
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,340
Not just for what he did I mean that was stupid anyway

708
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,700
But for the fact that the defense and I guess the defense team wins the stupid award too

709
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,780
But trying to blame it on hitman I

710
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,580
mean come on I

711
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:47,240
Mean get it's one thing to stab somebody and kill them that way, but like I

712
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:53,740
That's insane like they like on a scale of one to ten one being like not really fucked up and ten being like super fucked

713
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,580
Up like stabbing someone and killing them is at least twelve okay

714
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:02,420
That's beyond fucked up, but stabbing them then cutting off their head then burning their body

715
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,840
That's like 11 D billion on that scale okay

716
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:12,960
so you've got issues, and you need to go away for a long time where we won't see you ever ever again and

717
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,760
Don't try to blame it on a video game ass

718
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,480
Stories like this make me angsty

719
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:43,360
Oh, you know what happens usually after the stupid award comes about of angst and we like to call that here our f-use of the week

720
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,080
Chuck soccer once you start us off tonight with the f-use of the week

721
00:53:46,080 --> 00:54:00,800
Okay, my f-u of the week goes towards people who drive really really slow like grandma slow

722
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,760
When you're going the speed limit and they're going less than the speed limit

723
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,080
And I know I talk about bad drivers all the time, but oh my god all of them were in front of me today

724
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:20,480
And also an f-u goes towards the amounts of cleaning I've done in the past week in our house

725
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:27,200
But I did get something really awesome. I have a toy. I call it the doctor's cleaning tool. It's called a sonic scrubber

726
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,960
Nice and you use it for cars, and I used it for the bathroom instead, but anyway

727
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:42,160
Just all the dust that got kicked up from all the cleaning I've done for Dan's pinball gathering tonight

728
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:49,560
Has had my eyes bloodshot like all week, so f-u to dust too

729
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,560
Loki do you have any f-u's of the week?

730
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:58,560
F-u goes to this chair that I'm sitting on because it's horribly uncomfortable

731
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,560
We will try to find a cheap chair for you at IKEA or something I promise

732
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,960
IKEA has comfy plastic ones

733
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,560
I want to get another chair like that. That chair is awesome the one you sit in

734
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,360
I know they can't see it on just TV because you're secretive, but it's a very nice chair

735
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,360
Sorry, look is that it?

736
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,360
That's it. I got nothing else

737
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,560
F-u to my pancreas which continues to bother me. I've been having chest pains today

738
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:23,560
Although thankfully I've been getting a little bit better and speaking of food. I actually ate a full meal last night

739
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,160
It was very nice

740
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,960
I went to Mimi's and they have a low fat menu and they have a spaghetti marinara dish

741
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,760
It was actually pretty damn good for low-fat, but I'm so sick of this low-fat diet

742
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,360
I mean granted it's nice to have lost 25 pounds and all but I am so

743
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,960
Sick of eating low-fat like seriously when Loki brought in that pizza tonight

744
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:49,160
I'm like I would kill you for a slice of pizza Rob. What? I was going to let you know that I

745
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,160
actually do have a good number of

746
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:59,940
Low fat and low sugar recipes. Oh cool from my phase of South Beach that I would be more than happy to share with you

747
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,060
So you can enjoy some of the food that you're missing good time

748
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,800
So, you know what I'm craving right now though is like I I don't think it's low-fat though

749
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,960
I want like a teriyaki rice bowl or something

750
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,960
I guess just depends on who makes it and how they make it but oh that sounds so good right now

751
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:13,720
All right

752
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,840
Anyhow enough about food because I'm getting hungry because I haven't eaten dinner yet that will conclude the F use of the week and we'll

753
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,840
Get back into the show

754
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,560
with some more gaming news

755
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,560
well, we've already known that the

756
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:30,480
You know US and North America. We're gonna be getting a I guess limited-edition

757
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,080
Metal Gear Solid bundle with the game, of course an 80 gig system and

758
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:45,800
Also, I guess, you know the DualShock 3 controller well now there's also another bundle coming that's gonna be the

759
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:52,000
Gunmetal gray PlayStation 3. In fact, it was confirmed by Konami's Brandon Loreno

760
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,160
on the official PlayStation blog that this very very limited-edition system will be available in the North America as

761
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:05,880
Part of a special Metal Gear Solid 4 bundle. So I guess it's the same thing, but this one's Gunmetal

762
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You know silver grayish

763
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
and

764
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:17,600
So I guess both these are gonna be scheduled to arrive around the game's release date of June 12th

765
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:25,480
But I good luck getting your Gunmetal gray they're gonna be super rare basically, yeah super rare

766
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,920
I bet I bet I know something that's even more rare and I know I can say something about this now because Bobby said it

767
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,920
On his show tonight. I can talk about this a little bit

768
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,200
All games radio which you know, we're a part of is going to be giving away

769
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:41,000
This is super duper rare an Xbox 360 Grand Theft Auto 4

770
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,040
Box, okay. There's only like 500 of these puppies in existence all games got one and they're giving it away and

771
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,760
Base and they're not giving it to you Loki. I'm sorry to say you're ineligible stupid rock star. Listen, okay

772
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,760
I played more of Grand Theft Auto

773
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,520
PSP multiplayer and trust me that's pretty painful

774
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,520
Okay, that game had some pretty bad multiplayer

775
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:09,800
but I loved it and we played it more than anybody any human on the face of this earth and

776
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,880
Yet, you know, no love for me. What the hell?

777
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:20,520
Well, here's the way it works on all games radio every show that's on the network gets to pick a finalist

778
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,080
Basically, it gets to do a contest to pick a finalist

779
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:27,600
So we'll be picking our finalist either next week or the week after but if you don't win with us

780
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:33,560
You might be able to win with Bobby black wolf. You might be able to win all games interactive video game outsiders

781
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,880
Platform nation, you know one of the you know countless other shows that all games radio has

782
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:43,440
Everybody is gonna every show is gonna send one finalist to a last round and I don't know what they're gonna do at that point

783
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,120
When the freaking mark echo, I mean, come on, man. They're just like throwing them away now. So stay tuned next week

784
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,680
We'll have more details. We may even do the qualifier next week. I'll post more on the website

785
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,400
I just I have to know the all games timetable either be next week or in two weeks. So we'll see

786
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,720
Okay back to the news. Yes news because ferrets are always

787
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
relevant to to my interests

788
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:12,080
a something else is relevant to my interest is the BBC and the we and they rhyme because the BBC on we is cool we

789
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,440
anyway, so

790
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:23,440
There is a an I player replay service that the BBC has that's going to be functional on the Wii and the service is

791
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,360
one that

792
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,040
It's actually already available on iPod touch and iPhone that will do

793
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:36,720
You limited by time different replays of BBC shows including Doctor Who torch wood

794
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,480
Which are two of my favorites and whatever else they want. So, uh, it's actually

795
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:48,280
It's for we owners in the UK. I actually want to try this on my on my iPhone. I would love to try it

796
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:56,160
But if anyone wants to actually see what's what's playing on there. The address is BBC co dot UK

797
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,600
Slash I player and you can see what they've got up for now. That's pretty sweet

798
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,360
I was reading this concept a little bit earlier for the show start

799
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,960
I'm like this is this is a great next step for the Wii

800
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,320
I mean talking about wanting to be like, you know a centerpiece in the living room with its news and forecasting

801
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,440
We talk about being able to bring television shows like that

802
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,620
I mean even more so the next like what if you didn't have to pay for it?

803
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,720
Well, I mean one thing though that I do want to mention

804
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
that might be a

805
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:27,440
A problem is that the BBC's website does IP check

806
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:35,160
For example when the Sarah Jane adventures were just coming out. You actually couldn't even look at their website. It would block it completely and

807
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,960
About I even use two different IP directors and it still had me blocked

808
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,520
so but just for what's on there right now as far as featured items is

809
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,940
Actually the last episode of Doctor Who that aired the other day

810
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,440
Which was called Pompeii the last day

811
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,440
There's also

812
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,520
Not dodi open house to buy or not to buy

813
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,400
Freaky Eaters

814
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,280
Dateline London. Yeah, if you care

815
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,960
There's some pretty good stuff on there love soup. I I would watch a lot of BBC shows

816
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,720
I hope I kind of secretly hope they'd bring it over here and a show little Britain a show that my husband likes is

817
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,560
Top Gear

818
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,560
He watches episodes of that on YouTube

819
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:23,780
Um, but Top Gear is also available to that. It's if you're a big, you know racing or car fanatic. That's a good show

820
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,320
All right, well, we'll see well this is kind of interesting it's been

821
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,440
How now maybe leaked out on?

822
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,720
When Animal Crossing for the Wii will be coming out

823
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,080
apparently

824
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:44,600
Apparently there is a calendar available for the club Nintendo

825
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:50,640
Folks, and of course, you know for April they have well, I should say they have different games for each month

826
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,360
The backgrounds and stuff. So for April, of course, they have Mario Kart Wii

827
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:00,640
Well guess what games in December, of course Animal Crossing

828
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,140
They have a bunch of picture of the characters and that that could just be a huge coincidence

829
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:08,900
Could be but I mean no last game that came out was on the DS and that was around

830
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,520
November December ish so

831
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,720
You know, it could be just a coincidence as come out. I'd be interested to see what's on the other months

832
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,920
You know just to see if that that's that's the thing

833
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,560
Yes, the thing was kind of missing like what are what's in the other months were some of the earlier games from this year in

834
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,560
The earlier months like did you have you know?

835
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:30,000
Smash Brothers brawl for March February, you know, like professor Layton or something for

836
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:35,760
February and it is a bit of a stretch, but we'll see well

837
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,280
We are about to wind down here and we'll be taking Skype calls very soon

838
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,000
If you want to give us a call one eight seven seven game

839
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,120
Olr or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio

840
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:49,760
Keep in mind that is different from the other all games shows for those of you guys that are new to our show tonight

841
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,080
Thanks to our new relationship with all games calm keep in mind

842
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:57,980
We do have a different phone number than the rest of our shows that are live. Sorry. That's right or interrupt real quick

843
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:05,840
They actually have someone actually has the calendar and it sounds like it may just be a coincidence because January was Mario Galaxy

844
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,380
February was we fit but this is all stuff. That's Japanese dates. So, I don't know

845
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,800
March was Mario Party

846
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,080
They had April's Mario Kart may looks like they had like Yoshi's Island

847
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,440
June something Metroid Prime related

848
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,200
like Kirby

849
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,320
Just all their stuff. Yeah, it's just it sounds like it's just random

850
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:38,440
All right. Well, this isn't so random. This is very scientific and statistical. It's next generation published a report this week

851
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,440
It's the top

852
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,120
100 selling video games of the last two months to 12

853
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:49,560
I'm sorry last 12 months not two months last 12 months compiled both across North America and Europe

854
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,460
Okay, and I promised Jamie some cooking mama

855
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:57,120
Did you know that cooking mama cook-off is the 98th top selling game in the past 12 months?

856
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:01,880
Four hundred and seventy K units moved between North America and Europe pretty cool

857
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,280
That's that's a lot even though the game was kind of crap compared to the DS

858
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,280
Like it lost a lot of magic on its way to the Wii

859
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:13,840
Kind of interesting to lend me yours. You can take it anytime. I'm not I'm not that excited about it

860
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,160
I'm just quickly looking through the list to see if there's anything else notable on it

861
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:23,480
I noticed boogie is in at number 87 and I don't know how I felt about boogie. It was a little bit corny

862
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:29,080
But it's a lot of people. I I know that are casual gamers really like that game, so

863
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:35,400
Let's see I'll try to wind it down here and just get to some of the top games that sold in the past 12 months

864
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,240
What do you think what would your guesses be?

865
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,960
What would you say was the number one selling game in the past 12 months just speculating because I know you haven't seen this story yet

866
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,340
Halo 3 good good choice evil 3 mario Galaxy

867
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:55,060
Okay, here's the top 10 number 10 was brain age 2 4 million units remember

868
01:04:55,060 --> 01:05:01,060
This is North America and Europe combined for whatever reason doesn't count Japan though number 9 was Super Mario Galaxy

869
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,020
4.1 million units 8 was Assassin's Creed 4.9

870
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,800
7 was Pokemon Diamond and Pearl with 5 million 6 was need for speed pro street

871
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:15,660
5.4 million 5 was Madden NFL oh 8 5.7 million

872
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:21,180
4 was FIFA Soccer oh 8 because remember we brought Europe into the mix so you know a soccer game is going to sell

873
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:28,900
5.7 million as well number 3 this surprised me guitar hero 3 was the number 3 selling game of the past 12 months me I

874
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,540
Was just because it's so much more expensive

875
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:37,860
7.5 million units that doesn't surprise me, but I guess you consider all the systems this game is on

876
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:43,660
Number 2 Halo 3 8 million units. I was close yeah close

877
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:48,140
So you guys are both close the number one game though call of duty for modern warfare

878
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:55,060
8.3 million units yeah when you hear it, and then you think oh, yeah like seriously. I look at my friends list

879
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:59,540
There's always someone playing call of duty for always played the hell out of that game

880
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:04,820
Yeah, it's it's weird though because you know here on orange launch radio. That's not the type of game

881
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:08,740
We usually talk about it's not the type of thing we play, but I even said that I liked it

882
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:14,840
Yeah, we saw respect for it certainly weird imagine fashion designers number 66. Oh my God

883
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:22,700
You know what games not on this list imagine babies know what I have judgment. I have just not on the list that is correct

884
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:28,460
Good job. Loki. I did so notice some ps3 titles in there like I saw ratchet and clank in there somewhere

885
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,980
so

886
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:34,700
Well there you have it one more story then we're going to open up that skype line

887
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,380
And I don't know how it's going to run tonight

888
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:40,460
It might be kind of choppy because we have both justin TV and this higher bitrate streaming

889
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:45,620
I will have to can justin TV during this segment if we have problems just you know we got one more story

890
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:51,640
And it's a sweet one right Jamie. Yeah, it's really sweet and sappy makes my teeth hurt, but it's really cool

891
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:59,700
There is a guy and let me make sure that I pronounced his name correctly Brian Clema. I guess Clema kale I am a

892
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:01,900
who

893
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:05,240
by his own account made a custom level in

894
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:12,280
Super Smash Brothers Brawl this says Marry me and put the timer to infinite put peach Mario and

895
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:20,080
Kirby who is his intended fiancee's favorite character and just left the TV on so when she came home and turned on the TV

896
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,040
she's like oh, you're in the middle of the game, and then she saw that he had the ring in hand and

897
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,200
Look, he said look at TV again. She said yes, so I thought it was sweet. Oh

898
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,880
That's cute, and she proceeded to own him in Smash Bros. Brawl

899
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,880
I don't see how anyone can play on the Marry me level though

900
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:43,260
It'd be really freaking difficult to actually get out of the top part and land somewhere

901
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,160
You can beat somebody else up

902
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,400
You should put that level up for download for all the other nerds who want to do something like that

903
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,040
That's the Marry me level up. I'll tell you what though the best engagement story

904
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,860
I ever heard was dark soccer is that was my favorite tell the all-games crowd

905
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,740
Your engagement over a particular movie. I love this story

906
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,440
Dan and I

907
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:08,360
We well we had known each other. You know online for quite a while and when I moved out here we on

908
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:15,000
Valentine's day we were watching UHF. We were you know kind of broke. I didn't have a job and he was

909
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,680
working telemarketing somewhere, but

910
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,280
we were watching UHF and eating French baguettes and

911
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:31,920
Spinach dip and drinking that the kosher blackberry wine. I love how you remember every detail. It's so girly, but cute

912
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,240
Oh, shut up. I remember lots of details about lots of stuff and

913
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:43,920
We just sort of mutually decided to get married it was like we should get married okay when sometime okay, I

914
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:50,440
Just think the fact you got married over UHF is so funny. We're now brought us together. It's time to drink from the firehose

915
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,200
Yeah

916
01:08:53,200 --> 01:09:01,480
Marvel in the oatmeal you should have had that at your wedding the firehose we didn't actually have a

917
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:07,800
Wedding yeah, but at your you know you should have at least you know outside the courthouse

918
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:11,600
Black corset and a purple skirt and boots

919
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,680
When I got married it's awesome

920
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:21,400
And then I had cake and it was good and then and then we went home, and I slept in the next day

921
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,080
Okay

922
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:28,880
Romantic odd one in chat says God if I had a nickel for every time I got laid because of UHF and

923
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:35,760
DJ Morpheus you'd owe money. Yeah DJ Morpheus follows up with a zinger you'd owe five bucks

924
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:42,800
What's that old saying great minds think like me no Dan says it great minds think like us all right

925
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:49,080
Skyplines open one eight seven seven game. Oh LR again. I apologize a little bit experimental

926
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,760
We'll see how this first call works out. Hi. You're on orange lounge radio. Who's this?

927
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,440
Hello GS 68 what is on your mind my friend

928
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:05,200
Um I have a question for a low low key about my currently all right. What's up?

929
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,720
Logie or what's up GS 68 for Loki?

930
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:13,400
Um have you played online yet? Yes?

931
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:25,000
Um how's the online like if someone disconnects will they will they get replaced by CPU without you knowing like in Brawl?

932
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:32,260
I don't think anyone disconnected in the ones that I played, but like you can choose you know between matches or whatever

933
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,900
To leave or continue on to another race or something like that

934
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,960
It's just sometimes a little difficult to get connected

935
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:44,800
And it's kind of cool that once you're like if you're waiting in queue to you know join up the next game

936
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:51,080
You actually watch the other people playing their games, so you can kind of switch between different cart views and stuff like that

937
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,960
But I didn't actually see anyone get disconnected off there, so I don't know

938
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,360
I'd assume they they would lose points

939
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:06,580
Because the way the rankings work you start off with 5,000 points when you first start playing and then depending on where you place

940
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:11,020
um within the 12 you'll lose up to like

941
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:18,980
64 points and then gain maybe 64 points, so I'd imagine if if they disconnected whatever

942
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,300
No, sorry go ahead

943
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,100
I'm

944
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:29,500
Carroms saying that they can't hear me. I have to mic turn all the way up you were a little quiet

945
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:33,820
But that's okay. It might be on our end. Just keep talking don't listen. Don't let them bully you in chat. Oh

946
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,820
oh

947
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:43,260
Anyways, that's what turns me off from playing Super Smash Bros. Online in the with anyone mode cuz if

948
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:50,940
The game will disconnect you a game will please disconnect with a CPU and not tell you what's the point of playing online anymore?

949
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:56,500
I mean, I'm gonna just play against three CPU characters honestly gs68 there really wasn't one

950
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,360
And I think they just put it in as an afterthought to say they did it

951
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:04,660
That's my honest answer because it sounds like Mario Kart we has a much more robust type of online like I didn't even know it

952
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,900
Had that whole like ranking it has leaderboards

953
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:11,660
I have like a bunch of stuff and you can look at your friends and see where they are like you know the different times

954
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,980
And stuff you can download the top you know

955
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,860
Rankers their ghost data and race it if you want to

956
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:24,580
But not all that stuff works too. Well right now because of you know they're getting hammered

957
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:30,300
So like trying to download ghost data didn't work for me. I I tried a few times, and it didn't work in fact

958
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,180
I had to hammer online and finally get into a game

959
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:39,780
It took me about 10 tries, and I finally got to play an online game, but well you know that'll get fixed eventually

960
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:43,380
I'm sure but right now. It's just you know getting hammered pretty bad

961
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:49,060
All right any other comments gs68 or questions oh?

962
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:54,820
Yeah, I'm you didn't nominate any games for all our March Madness right you know we send in our lists later

963
01:12:54,820 --> 01:13:00,100
We we got in there late, so we weren't in on the nomination process for all our March Madness and just for the benefit because

964
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:04,180
Folks who only listen to us in the podcast may not know and all games folks may not know

965
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:10,180
DMN one of our other personalities from the old orange launch radio station kind of was rounding up this March Madness

966
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,820
Competition but involving video games. I'll be honest. It's very similar to the type of thing

967
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:20,660
You've probably seen on game facts in the past, but it wasn't with characters

968
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:21,300
It was with games

969
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:26,180
And he was trying to find the best game of all time of which super Metroid ended up winning last week

970
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:30,580
For which I got called every name in the book because I it was separated by one vote

971
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:35,380
Yes, even amongst all the chatters all the hosts in studio of which we had quite a few guests last week

972
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:40,220
It was separated by one vote and I cast the deciding vote to make super Metroid win over Chrono Trigger

973
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,220
And I took a lot of shit for it

974
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:47,500
But yeah, we did not actually send in the qualifier list because DMN closed it off early

975
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,940
But what would you want to ask about that? Yeah?

976
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:58,420
Yeah, what I would like ask him like our listeners like what games they wish she had nominated but I

977
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,780
mean that's

978
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,500
What I mean some games that are very

979
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:07,300
big like we're on the brackets and

980
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:11,580
So basically like I see that the kind of thing like you know what was missing

981
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:16,420
What should have been there? What what wasn't on the brackets that should have been? I think honestly you'd I?

982
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:20,380
Think the sampling was a pretty good sampling of like you know the

983
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:28,020
Mainstream best games that there were out there. I think honestly you would be diving into everyone's niche gaming

984
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:33,060
To see what it is they missed you know if you're an RPG fan you probably said oh

985
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:39,860
Where was grandia or where was you know some some niche RPG if you're a racing game fan?

986
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,860
You were probably like oh, where was you know?

987
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,780
Burnout or whatever it is so well

988
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:52,220
I mean I surprised to see that like obscure games like massive to the allegiance are the brackets yet

989
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:59,780
I gave like Castlevania simply that which is what which did so much pretty Castlevania series it what it basically took

990
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,540
To

991
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,020
the action

992
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:09,540
They can buy 2d action adventure gameplay RPG elements like that game was not on there

993
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:12,380
Yeah, Castlevania is one of my favorite games, too

994
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,900
You know if I'd nominated it would have been definitely in my top five

995
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,380
But I got to finish this up because we can move on to other calls

996
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,820
But I will say this we might try it again in a few months

997
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,140
Let the dust settle a little bit

998
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:27,420
Maybe when there's another thing going on now that we have the additional resources of all games comm maybe we can do something a little

999
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:33,980
More epic and maybe a little more inclusive of everybody's tastes so, but we'll see it's gonna be interesting though

1000
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:37,540
Cuz when you throw like if we were to do something all-encompassing of all games

1001
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:43,540
You know you take a show like all games interactive and a lot of those folks are really into the sports titles and the call

1002
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,180
Of duties and the things we don't give enough time to on this show

1003
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:51,260
So I think it would be very interesting to bring those two worlds together and see what still comes out on top

1004
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,780
We'll see what happens gs68 we got to let you go so we can get some more calls him

1005
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:58,140
But thanks so much for the phone call buddy. All right. Take care. All right all right

1006
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:00,480
We're gonna take some more calls one eight seven seven game

1007
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:05,940

01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:50,060
I don't know people are just having technical difficulties all right

We'll give it one more try if you want to give us a call here on orange launch radio

1018
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:57,220
The lines are open now that last call didn't go so well, so I have to edit that out

1019
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:01,300
But we're taking more calls. Let's go to this call. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

Ever it's with the exception of e3 specials. We've done with brought in more people, but

1029
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:52,460
Who knew the voltron of podcasting would work both Bobby and us are benefiting from this so big about it is amazing

1030
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:57,260
Cross-promotion, that's awesome work. It was

1031
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:04,180
Surprised you guys didn't do it soon enough it did slide through 65. You know probably like a year. You know you're earlier

1032
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:09,380
I mean yeah hindsight is always 20 20 isn't it look you got a question. What's on your mind?

1033
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:15,580
Basically all right since I managed to get a PSP last Friday and managed to get a hat

1034
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:20,260
I need some good. You know some good apps. Okay. I mean you I

1035
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:26,100
Know you got to help me out with a little bit of something, but why else can I put on my PSP?

1036
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,420
Turn the homebrew

1037
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:30,420
What now I'm sorry I?

1038
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,780
Can't I couldn't understand him

1039
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:35,940
Um I just heard I just turned down the bandwidth on Justin TV

1040
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:40,060
So hopefully we'll get a little better. He wants to know like PSP apps. He should have I don't know

1041
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:45,820
I haven't downloaded anything in a long time. I guess emulators. I mean that's kind of cool, but uh you know PSP radio, maybe

1042
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,700
I

1043
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:50,940
Don't know

1044
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:52,940
Really downloaded a number

1045
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,700
I

1046
01:18:54,700 --> 01:19:00,180
Know Zaku you should get the you you should get the PSP radio thing in the latest firmware

1047
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:03,620
And you can listen to all games radio now on the PSP radio anywhere you go

1048
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:10,140
You got you got the latest firmware hacks already got that one actually

1049
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:14,660
Zaku you reminded me of something and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but did you see this?

1050
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:21,380
Loki I'm curious if you saw this Sony sent out a poll earlier this week basically asking people. Why do you hack the PSP?

1051
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:24,620
Yes, I kind of try. Why do you hack?

1052
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:30,340
The basically they sent out a poll saying like you know and it asked people to rate things on a scale like one to seven

1053
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:32,300
Going like you know yes, I agree or no

1054
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:32,740
I don't agree

1055
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:38,260
You know like I hack my PSP because I like the challenge or I hack my PSP to give it features of the PSP

1056
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:41,100
I have my PSP to steal games kind of interesting

1057
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,900
I

1058
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,900
Hack it just to spite you

1059
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,020
How about how about a couple good websites?

1060
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:53,980
Zaku can keep an eye on because really it's about what you want to do with the PSP so had a couple good websites for

1061
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,100
I guess psphacks.com

1062
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,460
pspupdates.qj.net

1063
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:07,020
Stuff like that I mean those would be two websites I'd check they have a lot of downloads on there and stuff

1064
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:08,820
right

1065
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:13,260
I just barely had trouble today. Just getting some proper emulators. You know

1066
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:19,040
But you know at least I know people you know like you Loki and other folks that can you know help me out

1067
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:25,360
That's good. You gotta get back on that scene. I mean three latest M33 is pretty damn good right now

1068
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,160
Especially when your PSP is overclocked

1069
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,080
Alright Zaku we got to let you go so we can get more calls any quick final thoughts

1070
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:37,360
I'm gonna get your PSP hacked. Don't leave you. You know fuck Sony's

1071
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:43,320
Endurance all right. Just know somebody went up in door, but battery. That's all you need to know all right

1072
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,440
It's all about the battery take care, buddy

1073
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:52,600
1 8 7 7 game olr. I'm hoping our next call will be a little better with the bandwidth because I dropped Justin TV a lot

1074
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:57,160
In the video they're probably just seeing a still picture in there right now. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1075
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,360
Hi guys, this is footy monster. See that's a lot quicker

1076
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:05,680
It was like no and the footy monsters in Argentina, so we might just have to do that every week on just TV anyway

1077
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:10,240
Sorry, we're learning about our show live. What's on your mind footy monster noise at all

1078
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:15,640
I just want to share a couple of things for a quick first off congrats on your new home. Thank you

1079
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:20,360
We like it. Hey quick dark Sakura put some of the nice silverware here from all games in your purse

1080
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,120
Okay

1081
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,880
All right, sorry, what's up?

1082
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:30,480
Well, you know that story you had earlier about Brazil and the whole bully thing

1083
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,200
Yes, I do well

1084
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,720
Here's the thing as far as understand since it's pretty close from here

1085
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:43,120
The only country that I know that's in South America that has any sort of official distribution of anything is actually Chile

1086
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:48,500
And they have Microsoft like Sony doesn't release anything officially and Nintendo doesn't release anything officially

1087
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:53,720
Argentina used to have official distribution of Nintendo products, but those that was like in 1995

1088
01:21:54,160 --> 01:22:00,620
So I'm thinking and and this is just a theory that you know anything that happens in Brazil

1089
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:05,380
Rockstar will never care for because it's not that they were sending their game to Brazil

1090
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:12,180
Because they are not doing it. It's just you know retailers importing the game and having a great market so to speak um

1091
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:17,220
You know what's interesting though is that it's interesting in Nintendo doesn't support

1092
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,220
South America more because like I was just kind of noticing

1093
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:24,220
I was just looking at some of the box art on a recent game drew was here last week

1094
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:28,340
And he gave me back super paper Mario because he borrowed it and I was just kind of eyeing the back of the box

1095
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:30,540
And kind of noticing how like it's interesting on Nintendo

1096
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:35,740
Puts the back of their boxes in three different languages all at once now like you look at the back of a box of a

1097
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:40,580
Nintendo game it's in English French and Spanish all in the back, but you read some of the fine print yes

1098
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:46,980
I was very bored it talks about how the game is only for distribution in the United States Canada hence the French and

1099
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:52,240
Latin America they say hence the span of Latin America is like Puerto Rico

1100
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:55,820
Which is basically the u.s.. And Mexico is basically the u.s.. Which well

1101
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:59,100
I think some of our Mexican listeners might disagree, but but

1102
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,700
Yeah, but at the same time the distribution of products

1103
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:06,380
I do find it interesting because then they're basically saying well Latin America is just Mexico

1104
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:11,560
It is kind of interesting that they are cutting off the rest of the countries south of Mexico

1105
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:16,620
Well, no not really. I mean considering the economies that we have here. It's not that surprising

1106
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:19,940
I mean who's over here what you have to spend to play a game?

1107
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:25,860
I mean I was just the other day at the shop buying a 360 game well attempting to and it was like 90 US dollars

1108
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:32,580
So I'm not gonna go buy a game for that price, so if Nintendo had to officially release their games support the region

1109
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,740
We think the prices of games are gonna be

1110
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:42,300
You know and they I mean they're not gonna sell at what people here could buy because they will have no profit and even worse

1111
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:47,620
You know people from the US would import from South America, and it's the same thing right and pay cheaper true

1112
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,760
It would never work. I guess that's true. I

1113
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:53,940
Guess we had to get the realist perspective so in the mean in the meantime

1114
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:57,220
How are you getting your games footy remind our listeners? How do you get your games?

1115
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:03,100
Do you just have to pay the mark up or do you import or what actually I got a 360 quite recently I?

1116
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:10,080
Probably January, and I had the option of flashing the bias and just you know like lucky

1117
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,980
Look at us in one of his 360s and part of my games

1118
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:18,960
But I actually really like the live experience, and I actually bit the bullet then whenever I go to Chile games

1119
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:25,460
They're a pretty and another cheap, but they're competitive prices with the u.s.. I seen I could buy Mass Effect with 50 bucks

1120
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:28,800
Or the other day I found lost Odyssey for 45 bucks

1121
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,900
Oh nice, so you know it's like the prices are even sometimes

1122
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:36,320
They're even cheaper like a god deal a for new seal for 20 bucks, so

1123
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:41,980
What I could what I did is just actually go there because I have family there and whenever I make a trip

1124
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:46,060
I just bring two or three games with me. You know because here. It's like $100, but over there

1125
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:52,660
It's since Microsoft official distributes the games. It's totally you know possible to actually buy original games so right now

1126
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:57,820
I'm buying original games and just doing it on ps2. I had to back. You know buy backups

1127
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:00,980
That's all you could do and on my DS. It's I do the same thing

1128
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,260
It's very interesting footy to hear you kind of talking openly about

1129
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:09,820
Pirating games which you know has ruffled some feathers in the past here on this show with some of our listeners who are against pirating

1130
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:11,820
Which you know I understand

1131
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,820
Let me let me make this straight

1132
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:18,140
It's interest, but it's interesting though footy when it's your only option

1133
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,500
You know like you're talking about I mean

1134
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:25,620
It's that or smuggle your games from Chile or not play games because really I mean just because you don't have money

1135
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:30,460
Your option is not stealing. You know I do because I am fully aware that I'm doing something

1136
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:34,800
That's not entirely legal or morally you know correct, but I have that better

1137
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,540
I will this is a small anecdote here when I was a kid

1138
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:42,340
I used to go to a computer shop to get my computer games in floppy disks

1139
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:45,820
And I would go my floppy disk that I would buy in a box at a retailer

1140
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:49,580
Go there, and you know look at through a list of games and ask them for a game

1141
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:53,780
And they would I would pay them and I would go home to me that was totally normal and reasonable

1142
01:25:53,780 --> 01:26:00,940
That was how you got games right only later. I understood that that's illegal, but that was the way you did it here

1143
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:05,900
Hmm, so there's another culture of original games here there. I mean really there isn't

1144
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:11,940
So that's part of the problem as well piracy is just so rampant you know that it's like the way it is

1145
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:14,860
It's like go to China and say you know with the same argument. It will not work

1146
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:19,460
I guess it's so interesting to hear from around the world kind of the way things work because sometimes

1147
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,620
We're in our little bubbles in these other countries

1148
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:26,220
We live in so what I love about the internet and doing these podcasts and talking to people from around the world as you get

1149
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,660
To hear you to hear from gamers everywhere footy

1150
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:31,280
We got to wrap up and let you go, but anything else you want to say to our listeners

1151
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:34,780
That's pretty much it guys. I guess I'll talk to you later. All right. Good luck footy. Take care

1152
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,780
YouTube

1153
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,720
Smuggles his games from Chile amazing

1154
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:43,100
Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1155
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:47,860
This is the excuse next to be a second time and hopefully more stable way

1156
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:54,140
Then you sound millions light-years better hello, Tony. I know you sound telephony probably cuz he's on the telephone

1157
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:59,040
He's on the 877, but that's all right. Yeah, what's on you? I blame Skype. I blame Vista. I blame

1158
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:04,860
I calm crap and you know everything else I can blame. It's not my life is five. Don't forget to blame them. Oh

1159
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:11,420
Yeah, sure by 365 screw the RA the older fault. All right, and the police. All right

1160
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,200
Jason what's on your mind?

1161
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:17,460
Two short things and one quick thing

1162
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:22,980
And one longer thing. Did you know that they made an impossible mission remake on the Wii?

1163
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:28,320
Yes in Europe. Where is it here? I want it. Gimme gimme gimme

1164
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:35,340
On my video game shelf come over and play it sometime. Shut up. Did you import it from Europe?

1165
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:43,060
No, it was in the we went to Best Buy we were checking out and it was just sitting in those discount bins

1166
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,540
What I looked at it

1167
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:50,680
I laughed it said I'm getting this and bid and I've already played it then the game must come out here under the radar. I

1168
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:57,840
Yeah, it doesn't have any it's obviously not all it works on our TV without anything special, you know

1169
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,840
You use freeloader any of that stuff, right?

1170
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:04,920
Well shit, I'm gonna go get but I'm gonna go pick that up tomorrow then. All right, cool

1171
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:08,880
Thanks for the heads up. Hold up. Well, I didn't even know it came out here. That's great

1172
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,400
It's cuz it didn't it did it did not it only came out in the DS

1173
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:19,560
Yeah possible mission DS 10 bucks on Amazon. All right. Well, we'll see I'm gonna have to pick it just cuz I'm sure

1174
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:24,840
It plays like crack at the box. I'll look for more logos. I will take a picture and show you guys

1175
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,560
I it's not that I don't believe you. Oh here. Here's the best way to tell

1176
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:34,080
Here's the best way to tell Jason see if it has a rating an ESRB rating on it because if it doesn't oh, yeah

1177
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:38,240
Then it's different overseas. Aha. That's the way to tell. So anyway, what was the other?

1178
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,280
What was the other story with little or what was the other story right now?

1179
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:46,080
But the I'd barely they're watching Mulan Roo, so it's kind of noisy out there and I want to make too much of a ruckus

1180
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:49,560
No, what are they singing? What are they singing along? No

1181
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:55,080
But I heard them laughing uncontrollably just a minute ago. So good enough. I guess Oh girls

1182
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,600
All right. Oh, yes, of course

1183
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:04,440
I completely forgot what the second thing is. So I'll just skip to the last thing. All right farms is exceedingly intelligent

1184
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,760
Yes, he is. I

1185
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:11,040
Was obviously listening to the interview since I made it back in time to be able to listen to the show

1186
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:17,840
And the discussion along the lines of XNA and we wear and everything opening up new opportunities. It's

1187
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:26,100
Opening up another avenue for developers of the sort to showcase their talent, but it's not going to be a

1188
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:32,080
It's going to be the same thing with indie and underground games. We already have through a different medium

1189
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,480
It's you know, so the ones that are really good

1190
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:41,560
There will be that one game and then the talent from the studio or just a or just a specific individuals can be hired

1191
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,920
Onto a big-name studio and the cycles going to continue

1192
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:47,240
It's a it's a great new app a new absolutely

1193
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:54,680
But it's not going to fundamentally change the landscape of indie games being easily accessible and open to everybody and it was just very

1194
01:29:55,480 --> 01:30:02,200
Interesting to hear somebody else. I mean go figure developer especially was it's very interesting to hear him say the exact same thoughts

1195
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:06,280
That I would have on such a thing. It's a great thing, but it doesn't change the landscape, but and

1196
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:11,760
Plus the fact that you know, he's in another country too. So you kind of get you know, that whole thing

1197
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,800
I was just talking about with footy monster hearing from gamers around the world hearing

1198
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:20,500
It's still the same idea over there. Not that there's you know, obviously all the all the companies are in Australia doing business

1199
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:26,480
It's it's not that radically different from what it is over here in Europe or what have you but still still interesting that it all

1200
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,380
Comes to that kind of same thought. I I don't know

1201
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:33,760
Maybe I blew the XNA thing out of proportion a little bit when we first heard it about it on the show

1202
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:40,040
But I still think it's going to be a pretty radical, you know, it's just like YouTube didn't change the internet

1203
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,280
Completely, but it had a great impact that was felt

1204
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,320
you know what I mean and live people know what YouTube is and where I

1205
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:52,380
Honestly think XNA is going to be a YouTube of sorts for gaming. That's kind of how I feel

1206
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:58,080
Did you play those little community XNA what two-week trial games that they had up there? Yeah, some of them were fun

1207
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:05,800
Yes, yes that they were it's I don't know that it's gonna have the same I completely understand your comparison

1208
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,880
but I don't think it's gonna have the same impact as YouTube just because

1209
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:14,400
Gamers the the XNA toolkit as I've talked to Bobby about the past and other various things

1210
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:20,900
Apparently the XNA toolkit is exceedingly interesting, but it doesn't lower the bar YouTube lowered the bar

1211
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:24,740
You take a video clicking the buttons and you're done. I guess that's true. This is

1212
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:31,380
Yeah, this is very special and it is a great Avenue, but it's not gonna fundamentally change everything

1213
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:32,140
So, okay

1214
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:32,820
I you know

1215
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:37,060
I am comparing apples to oranges a little bit but I still kind of think that whole concept where it's gonna be a lot

1216
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:40,460
Easier for the people that can do it to get their stuff out there because you know

1217
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:43,960
You look at some of those little trial games that came out, you know games like the dishwasher

1218
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:50,300
Jelly car were yards better than Yaris. You know what I mean? They were a while ago

1219
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:54,580
It's the loop and some of the other, you know, there's been some other junk on expo

1220
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:59,940
I hate to say it but the Tron ports weren't all that great like they could have done better and some of the other classic

1221
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:01,940
Game ports, you know what I mean?

1222
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:06,060
Yeah, I just think you know put it put these new game developers me interesting

1223
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:11,820
these new games can certainly hold a candle to classic remakes and

1224
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,480
Shit like yours. Yeah

1225
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:20,560
Jason we got a wrap up here so we can sign off for the night. It's already midnight 30 on the East Coast

1226
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,400
Do you have any quick final thoughts for us? I

1227
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:29,200
Wish I knew with all I wanted to say, but I forgot so good night. Well, you can always call us next week

1228
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,320

1231
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,960
We're gonna wrap up the show. But first we got to get some last-minute news

1232
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,440
I'm gonna check in with Loki and see if there's any last-minute news

1233
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:52,360
Not really much but it's kind of interesting it looks like

1234
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:57,000
There's a hacking group blaze team that has released a hacked

1235
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:03,640
We virtual console game that they've broken the encryption on so that's a whole

1236
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,320
Big old can of worms that Nintendo probably doesn't want opened

1237
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,560
and

1238
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:13,960
Then there's some other interesting things castle

1239
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:21,360
Crashers, it looks like it's gonna have some new characters including a bear that fights with a fish and

1240
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:29,560
You also I guess get little I don't know helper pets or something like that. They have a floating cat

1241
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,120
It's kind of funny. I can't wait for this game to come out a

1242
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:40,800
A floating cap. Yeah, it's an animal orb. It says the cat who will add to your agility and strength

1243
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,760
Interesting I

1244
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,760
Don't know. It's it's cute

1245
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:53,980
Rosteel UT says the ESRB org lists impossible mission for DS PS 2 PSP and we I gotta go look for that

1246
01:33:54,320 --> 01:34:00,240
They have yeah scratch paws the cat which is a cute name for a cat scratch paw. I'll let a cute

1247
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,600
they also have

1248
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:06,360
There are some other pictures in here. They have like a little bird and a dog and

1249
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,120
I

1250
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:14,860
Don't know. It's just it's just all on a dev blog dot the behemoth calm

1251
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:18,480
And you can check out like they show off the different weapons and stuff

1252
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,400
Was it the barbarian axe fish?

1253
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,340
They have a thin sword skinny sword thick sword pumpkin peeler

1254
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:33,520
And the different characters for castle crashers looks like

1255
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,540

1256
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:39,460

You know other than and they're gonna have a lot of characters to play as that games gonna be fucking awesome can't wait

1258
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:56,380
That's really it I think didn't we talked about games for Windows magazines going online only yeah

1259
01:34:56,380 --> 01:35:02,180
I think so, but yeah, it is it's kind of the way magazines are going right now anyway. Yeah, I had to say

1260
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:07,340
All right, we're gonna wrap up. We're running pretty long tonight on our first all-game show, but that's all right

1261
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:10,660

1262
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:13,460

01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,500
It's hot in here

1264
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:21,340
It's getting cooler. It's cooling down as the night goes on low-key your final thought. It's hot and humid in here
