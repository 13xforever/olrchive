13868	26043	Tonight, April 20th, 2008, Rock Band is set to get its first full albums, Soul Calibur the original is headed to Xbox Live Arcade, and did a recent video game release borrow its box art from the internet?
31528	35993	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36013	42541	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42601	47767	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48067	48368	Hi.
48988	49989	And how are you, Jamie?
50310	51211	I'm a little tired.
51556	53278	I'm sorry to hear about the tiredness.
54299	57682	I can tell you're quiet and you seem like your energy is depleted a little bit.
58482	61365	Well, happy late birthday to you, Miss Jamie Summers.
61405	66450	I know this weekend was your birthday and I guess you're just too exhausted from all the partying, huh?
67076	76521	I went to San Francisco for Sakura Matsuri and I was very sad because it was so windy that all the blossoms had been blown off of the trees except for a few.
76861	77901	Oh no.
79462	83124	But I did a lot of shopping and they changed Kinokuniya.
84426	88632	That has a whole anime, manga stuff section downstairs.
89173	89633	Interesting.
91035	97465	That's where all the fanboys were, but that's also where all the Copic markers and deleter pads were, so I had to go down there.
97785	99946	I noticed you brought back a video game magazine all in Japanese.
99966	100906	It looks like Famitsu magazine.
100926	102547	I brought back last month's issue of Famitsu.
102867	103127	Nice.
103287	109509	And I brought back the first issue of the Blue Dragon manga, which is interesting.
109669	112771	Yeah, I was thumbing through it and I'm like, this looks to have nothing in common with the video games.
112851	114711	It's not done by Toriyama.
114971	115332	Interesting.
116412	118833	And I brought back a bunch of comics.
119482	120202	Cool, cool.
120742	123584	I know she's getting a lot of belated happy birthdays in our chat room.
123724	125484	Thank you, everybody else in the chat room.
125724	128966	And if you want to join us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.
129046	133527	Even though we do tape live on all games radio, we do use a separate chat room still, our old chat room.
133567	137889	It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com, or if you're already on the Game Search Network, it's channel Orange Lounge.
138129	140271	And I got pie today, but I haven't eaten any of it.
140391	141832	Birthday pie instead of birthday cake?
141852	145075	Because my boss baked me a cake on Friday.
145615	148898	Well, not on Friday, but she brought me carrot cake, homemade carrot cake.
149018	150239	Because carrot cake is my favorite cake.
150399	150660	Nice.
151180	152561	She baked me a cake.
153662	154263	I'm so happy.
154423	156785	That's even better than giving you a cookie is baking you a cake.
157305	158226	And I got pie today.
158646	158907	Nice.
159027	159567	What kind of pie?
159587	160848	I did eat a lot of cookies, though.
161249	162029	I had samosas.
163150	163731	I love samosas.
164218	169180	I ate them, they were cold too, and had Mars Bars eggs, and Nestle Black Magic eggs.
169380	173661	Oh, you gotta stop talking, I miss all these foods ever since I had to go on the low-fat diet thanks to the pancreas.
173681	174461	Pie is good for you.
174741	176102	Alright, let's move on.
176122	177182	It's full of vitamin banana.
177382	180443	Let's move over and say hello to Techmaster Loki, who also joins us every week.
181083	181643	Hello.
181903	182223	How are you?
182724	183284	I'm doing good.
183384	184724	Any cookies or pie in your day?
185264	185724	No.
185904	186805	Did you have an exciting weekend?
186825	187425	Do you have anything fun?
191004	194025	I waited two hours to eat at Joe's Crab Shack yesterday, I guess.
194585	195226	No, that's not fun.
195326	195986	Two hours?
196506	196886	Two hours.
196906	198567	That must have been some damn good seafood.
199387	201388	No, it's just we were damn patient.
202289	205150	It's really popular here, though, in Sacramento, though, because it's on the river.
205330	207170	It was Saturday night.
207231	209672	It was during Dinner Rush, and they had prom people there.
210372	210932	Oh, okay.
212072	213133	People are dumb.
213641	215042	I was out of town for four days.
215522	216783	I missed Jamie's birthday, sadly.
216803	219105	I was completely out of town since Thursday.
219245	225930	I did my yearly pilgrimage out to the middle of nowhere, also known as Mendocino, which is up on the north coast of California.
226991	234737	Part of it's a vacation from life, but it's also a vacation from the internets and everything because there's no phone connection out there.
234777	235577	There's no internet.
235597	236198	There's no nothing.
236238	237699	Just the beach, hot tub.
238179	242302	Good times, except for the food poisoning I got that kept me in bed all day Saturday.
242382	242943	That kind of sucked.
243834	249278	Oh well, I did end up playing some video games, so I'll talk about that in a minute, right after we get to DarkSakura's Gaming Week.
249518	250219	How was your Gaming Week?
250999	263148	Um, it wasn't, well, other than Ragnarok, but I bought Famitsu and Blue Dragon Manga, and we were supposed to hook up the Dreamcast.
263649	270214	We had talked about hooking up the Dreamcast so that I could play a couple of things that I've been sort of having an itch to, but instead I downloaded ZSNES today.
272253	275314	Ssj100Matt says, you ate at the Crab Shack on Passover?
275334	275494	Fired.
302803	308465	Somebody who didn't change their name, OilArmyRecruit2559 says, Always with the Ragnacrack.
309126	310366	Yeah, and your point is?
310766	312367	Did you ever sign up for the number two?
312387	313748	Solid Goomba, by the way.
314348	314548	Oh, okay.
314568	315809	Did you ever sign up for the number two?
316109	320971	No, I'm going to wait until they have more than just menus translated.
321692	324493	To get some of the bugs worked out from the early releases?
325194	328636	Yeah, because I'd actually like to be able to do the quests, and I don't read Korean.
329677	341905	I, amazingly enough, know how Korean is read, you know, how the characters are arranged, but I do not actually read any Korean.
342205	342545	Sorry.
343246	343646	It's alright.
343926	344547	Nobody's perfect.
345347	346708	Alright, let's move on over to Loki.
346748	348229	Was there any Korean in your gaming week?
348849	349070	No.
349210	349970	Oh, then what was there?
349990	350350	I don't think.
351051	351131	Um...
352342	355244	I played Omega 5, actually.
355264	358548	I was downloading some Xbox Live Arcade games.
358608	361470	I downloaded Ikaruga, but I never got the chance to play it.
361911	366775	I did play... Actually, I played the demo of... What was it?
366795	370118	I don't remember.
370559	371860	What was the new release this week?
371880	372441	Because I was out.
374301	378365	Rocky and Bullwinkle and... Oh, that's right, the minigame thing.
378385	380047	I wanted to check that out.
380067	381028	I gotta catch up.
381068	383411	I heard that sucked, but whatever.
384432	388817	I'm actually kind of excited there's another game out there that uses the webcam, other than Totem Ball.
389137	390258	Totem Ball and what, Uno?
391640	393361	Really, we shouldn't be encouraging them.
393762	394643	Alright, fine, whatever.
395363	397765	Um, so, yeah, I played Omega 5.
397825	398525	That was pretty cool.
398565	401187	It's just really hard, but that's kind of shooters for you, I guess.
401967	408611	Um, I played lots of Mario Kart, and it's kind of, I don't know.
409092	411093	I guess it's just like the other Mario Karts.
411233	413434	I still really hate the fact that you can't do...
414315	415096	Thanks for watching!
431855	433056	More Saints Row, yes.
434058	437161	I played multiplayer, but then I realized something.
437601	447131	I don't know why I haven't realized it before, but I just found a code in the game that actually makes this game totally different and a lot fun in just the weirdest way.
447432	449934	I couldn't stop giggling the entire time I was playing this.
451204	456669	The code is the evil cars code, and it makes all the cars in the game try to hunt you down and kill you.
457209	458631	Nice.
459371	461573	And so you'll be running around or something.
461593	468399	All of a sudden, this car comes from nowhere, just flying through the air just at your head, where they'll be backing up towards you.
468719	473043	And so I made it kind of a goal to run from one end of the map to the next.
473403	486652	and it's fun and in fact I think I might actually do a little video for YouTube or something like that just something funny with you know that whole thing in there because it's hilarious because you'll be hiding in like a little ditch or something all of a sudden all these cars fly over your head and stuff trying to kill you
487802	488863	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
511181	512202	As I was going to say, it would be fun.
512502	513963	That could be a fun multiplayer game.
513983	516265	Who can live longer being chased stocked by the cars?
517205	524270	What I've been doing, like I said, I put in the infinite ammo code, the infinite sprint, and just go crazy.
524350	524890	Just run.
526612	527372	It's pretty hard.
527492	535718	Especially when you get onto the freeway and stuff and there's trucks coming after you and cars are exploding because they keep running into each other.
536809	537129	I don't know.
537409	538070	It's pretty cool.
538450	542691	SSJ100 Matt and Chad is chiming in with Death Race 3000, which he wants to point out is being remade.
543211	544872	Is that the one where you get stalked by cars?
544912	545312	Death Race?
546093	547993	No, that's the one that's just like Carmageddon.
548854	550334	No, I know the one you're thinking about.
550414	551875	It's a Stephen King movie.
551975	552555	It was Carrie!
553295	554736	No, Carrie was the... Christine!
555834	557575	Carrie was the prom queen.
557676	560578	Christine was the one about the Plymouth Fury.
560738	560958	Yes.
561318	564401	Well, there's another one I was thinking of where the cars were alive.
565021	567823	And remember they had that big rig with the clown face on the front?
568304	568404	It?
569044	569645	No, that wasn't it.
570105	570525	Forget it.
570746	571546	I don't remember what it's called.
571566	572227	It's not that important.
572867	574268	I'm sure someone in chat will know, though.
574308	575849	But, yeah, it's cool, though.
576110	581093	The code just, you know, I guess a little bit more life for this next few weeks until Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out.
581134	583736	And you've been extending the life of Saints Row for quite some time.
583756	585417	You're one of the only people I know that still just...
586321	587561	doesn't shut up about this game, ever.
587581	588161	It's a great game.
588702	593443	I already have my Saints Row 2 pre-ordered, so I can't wait to play that too.
594283	599064	Everyone's always pro-Saints Row or pro-Grand Theft Auto and hating on the other ones.
599124	600424	I don't understand why you can't like both.
600464	602104	I love both games just equally.
602604	604085	They're good in different ways.
604705	614567	Grand Theft Auto tends to be more realistic, where Saints Row is just absolutely batshit crazy with all sorts of stuff that you wouldn't be able to do in real life.
614787	615287	It's just great.
615987	619009	All right, chat.orangealtrader.com, some comments.
619709	625272	In response to the Vision Cam, VXJSNXV says, Rayman's Raving Rabbids on the 360 use the Vision Cam.
625573	626853	Unless, of course, you're talking about Arcade Consoling.
626913	632056	And Brad from PodCulture, Maximum Overdrive was the name of the movie with the cars there.
632417	633097	Nice work.
633777	634258	Nice work.
634878	637679	I was going to say about Rayman's Raving Rabbids.
637759	639759	I was already worn out from the Wii version.
639859	645801	I never even bothered with the 360 version because I was already kind of... It's dirt cheap now because that game didn't sell for crap.
646001	647021	Well, aren't they making a sequel though?
647902	649802	They already made a sequel, Rayman's Raving Rabbids 2.
649862	652643	They came out on the Wii last year around the holiday.
652663	653603	Apparently I slept through it.
654003	654864	Oh, you didn't miss much.
654884	655624	That's what I hear.
656673	659955	But they didn't do one for the 360 because the 360 one didn't sell at all.
660296	662798	Frisbee wants to know, can you use a vision cam on the computer?
662858	663978	Yes, you can, actually.
664299	669302	There's software available on Microsoft's website, but there's no audio with it, and the quality's not great.
670203	678990	I actually considered using it for our Justin TV feed, which is taping our show over at justintv.com, but the quality's not that great.
679790	681030	So, that's why we don't use it.
681650	682511	But it does work.
682651	683671	It is a USB camera.
684471	696334	My gaming week, believe it or not, even though I was out of town for four days, I did get the opportunity to play something new because what is going into the wilderness with ten of your friends staying in a cabin and not bringing along some party video game?
696374	699795	And I got to check out for the first time SingStar on the PlayStation 2.
700635	704676	And we've talked about this game an awful lot on the show, but I've always been more of a karaoke revolution player.
704696	705436	That's the games I've had.
705776	707797	But we did get to check out SingStar and
708877	710078	The friend of ours had a variety.
710158	713539	He had SingStar 80s, SingStar Pop, and SingStar Amped.
713799	719902	And I guess one kind of cool thing is that you could switch back and forth between the games without having to turn the whole dang thing off and on.
719942	722824	You just pop in another disc and it loads the 30 songs from that disc.
723544	724785	Each game has about 30 songs.
725345	726385	SingStar was kind of fun.
726465	728446	I was more impressed with it than I thought I would be.
728867	733769	The only kind of bitches I have is that I didn't like the pitch gauging quite as much as I do in Karaoke Revolution.
734049	736390	Like, you can only see your pitch as you sing.
736750	737531	You don't see it...
738271	743672	Any time you're saying something into the mic, like you do in Karaoke Revolution, you really kind of have to play both games to know what I'm talking about.
743932	748493	But if you play Karaoke Revolution, any time you make a sound, that arrow shows up on the line to show you where you're at.
748913	752414	Whereas in SingStar, you don't see it until you're already singing.
752854	759295	But one thing I did like about SingStar is that it had pretty much all the real music videos in the background as you're playing, which is kind of cool.
759656	765757	Like SingStar Pop has Aha Take On Me, so you know we had to play that just to see the video, because, I mean...
766557	769779	What was the last time you saw Aha take on me, the video?
769819	771479	I mean, it's got to be years and years ago.
771579	773821	Some of our listeners are probably too young to even remember this video.
774061	774241	What?
774801	775701	About four days ago.
776662	777582	On YouTube or something?
779263	780384	I hadn't seen it in years.
780484	782064	It's the one hit lender song.
782345	783025	I know, but still.
784583	788946	SSJ100 Matt says Rob in a cabin in the woods with SingStar horror movie plotline anyone?
789247	810983	kinda it could have been but I there was a lot of songs I sang and had a pretty recognizable song list I actually think I might want to pick this game up on Playstation 3 although only as a party game I mean you know how there's those video games that really only work when you have friends over SingStar is definitely one of those games maybe maybe
811451	814013	Because why get a PlayStation 3 for this crappy game?
814073	820177	Well, I'm not going to get it just for that, but I like the fact that there's the music videos, the actual music videos in the background, and the way it's put together is nice.
820257	823879	You know you just want it so you can film yourself and put yourself on that fake YouTube thing.
823899	826981	Hell no, hell no, because our listeners will find a way to exploit it.
827701	829423	I'm not going to subject myself to that.
830285	832286	Can you imagine me getting on there singing Like a Prayer?
832506	835067	You know what happened last time I sang Like a Prayer karaoke?
835347	839069	Yeah, it's been like 10 years and I haven't lived it down, so not gonna happen, sorry.
839929	841870	Or if it is, it's set to private or something.
841970	842350	We'll see.
842990	844011	So, alright.
845131	848493	And that, and I played on the PSP, because William brought his PSP.
848533	850113	He was playing the shit out of Puzzle Quest most of the time.
850413	853635	I played more Final Fantasy while I was sick yesterday, because I got food poisoning or something.
853655	855015	I was sick all day yesterday.
855035	855656	One or two?
855756	855836	One.
856716	859056	But it's the old school upgraded one on PSP.
859076	863777	I know I've talked about it on the show before a while back, but man, the graphics are just beautiful on the PSP.
864257	866218	That's one thing the PSP does have going for it.
866258	870599	Even though it has that little screen and everything, the graphics are high def and gorgeous.
870719	872879	That's one thing I really like about the PSP.
873699	878100	So I kind of want to go and get Final Fantasy 2 so I can play that on my PSP.
878120	880260	And then if I want to borrow Final Fantasy 1, I will.
880681	881621	I didn't get into the 2.
881861	882141	It was...
883228	883548	I don't know.
884229	884990	It's just different.
885390	885611	Yeah.
886011	886652	It's just different.
887853	888234	All right.
888494	889995	Well, that's going to do it for our gaming week.
890556	898345	So if you want to join in and chime in on our gaming weeks or the news for tonight, you can join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
898705	901888	In the meantime, we do have some housekeeping for you guys.
904006	916449	One thing that kind of made me sad, you know we have the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki at orangeloungeradio.wikia.com and that is growing and growing and the people, the listeners that have been contributing to that are doing an awesome job.
916849	917309	It's great.
917549	918849	The bad news isn't about that.
919189	924490	The bad news is about Wikipedia, the main site, you know, wikipedia.org.
924810	926611	You know how Orange Lounge Radio had an article on there?
927051	927611	It got zapped.
928413	929194	Somebody deleted it.
930154	930895	That's ridiculous.
931075	931736	Here's the thing.
931996	932936	Here's the thing I don't get.
933177	941483	I always thought that articles, when they got deleted from Wikipedia, had to go through a review phase for articles pended for deletion or whatever, and people are supposed to review it.
941523	941803	Nuh-uh.
942343	946086	When I looked in the deletion log, this guy named ClockworkSoul just nuked it.
946246	947267	He must be some admin on there.
947587	952751	He just nuked it, and it said, Web content does not indicate important significance.
953592	953872	Sad.
955113	957755	Without any debate or argument, this guy just kind of did it.
958840	960301	And now you know who to go after.
985994	988035	Probably the first show to use Skype.
988055	992218	There's a part of me that thinks we were the first online show to use Skype, and I think I have the post to back that up.
992678	998301	Not to toot our horn too much, but I think there are things we have accomplished that make it somewhat notable.
998921	1004685	What about the other websites referred to on there that are still there?
1006486	1008947	First site to use a PSP-based website?
1008987	1011428	First gaming thing to have a PSP spinoff site?
1012009	1012309	Whatever.
1013297	1014738	So let's just put it back up.
1015318	1016719	First and least updated.
1018821	1023724	Yeah, but I would just say if you guys are going to go back and recreate it, you just might want to source some things.
1023764	1026206	But you know some of our news stories are on YouTube, whatever.
1026766	1027787	Oh well, we'll see what happens.
1028047	1031890	Regardless, we do have the Orange Laundry Wiki, which is like ten times better anyway.
1032330	1033210	And nobody can delete that.
1034131	1034431	Whatever.
1034791	1035132	Whatever.
1035232	1035712	See if we care.
1036893	1036953	Um...
1038502	1041385	Our communities, we have MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1041405	1044990	We have our Facebook community, the Oil Army, our Live Journal community at Orange Lounge.
1045090	1047112	Join us if you are on any of those communities.
1047913	1052358	Speaking of community, the All Games community has banded together for this.
1052539	1053520	This is awesome.
1054716	1060541	A limited edition Xbox 360 Elite based on Grand Theft Auto 4 is being given away.
1060581	1062603	Now we have to correct something that was said last week's show.
1062663	1064424	It is not one of the 500.
1064945	1065685	That's the bad news.
1065725	1071010	It is not one of the 500 like uber limited edition things that Mark Echo got one of and we were making fun of him.
1071390	1073552	Where the other 499 went, we have no idea.
1073672	1076654	But the good news is it's one of eight.
1077608	1086411	This is one of eight Xboxes being prepared with the whole customization specifically for community websites as a Grand Theft Auto promotion.
1086531	1105517	Allgames.com has one and Orange Launch Radio is coming together with a bunch of all game shows including All Games Interactive, Dead Pixel Live, Bobby Blackwolf Show, Super Happy Funtime Show, Electric Sisterhood, Mediaspective, Chatterbox Video Game Radio, Video Game Outsiders, Ultimate Quest, Video Game Show and Platformation all coming together to give away this Xbox 360 Elite.
1106997	1109358	So, if you want to win this, you can.
1109719	1110699	Because here's how it's going to work.
1111219	1116122	Each one of those affiliates I just named is going to send one finalist to the final round.
1116142	1117102	And here's how it works.
1117323	1119584	Every show is doing the same giveaway.
1120224	1125647	What's going to happen is that... Okay, you know how like Grand Theft Auto, one of the big things in it is the radio stations that play?
1125667	1128528	Like, you know, Grand Theft Auto, huge on the soundtracks, right?
1129029	1131250	You know, the last one had what, like a four-disc soundtrack?
1131490	1132451	And they play all these songs.
1132711	1132911	Well...
1134119	1136301	Amidst the songs are fake DJs.
1136881	1140304	And people tell me all the time I sound like that one DJ in Grand Theft Auto.
1140324	1141545	What the hell is his name?
1141725	1142906	Yeah, Laszlo.
1143466	1144587	Apparently I sound like him.
1144607	1145728	I don't know if that's true or not.
1145968	1147469	I don't hear it, but I guess other people do.
1147909	1150391	So you know how Grand Theft Auto has those DJs and stuff?
1150411	1152773	They have little commercials and fake DJ things.
1153373	1154935	We want you to be that.
1155855	1156576	Here's how it works.
1156956	1158517	You are going to submit a sound clip.
1158557	1165242	It can't be any longer than two minutes and it has to be in the style of a Grand Theft Auto 4 radio station commercial.
1165623	1170086	It can be a spoof ad, a segment, it can be a little song and dance, whatever.
1170606	1173689	It has to somehow relate to Orange Lounge Radio.
1174369	1175610	Hey, that's the only thing.
1175630	1179192	It can be one of our in-jokes, and if you don't know any in-jokes, go check the wiki.
1179633	1182715	It can just say our name in it somewhere, whatever.
1183095	1186438	It just has to somehow relate to Orange Lounge Radio.
1186878	1190220	We will pick our favorites, like maybe our top five favorites.
1190580	1198166	The community will vote on the winner, which will then go on to the final round at allgames.com to win one of these eight rare 360s.
1198206	1201028	So that's like, what, two minutes worth of voiceover?
1201048	1201128	Yeah.
1201468	1206192	for possibly an Xbox 360 Elite, one of eight being made in the world.
1207453	1208014	So there you have it.
1208274	1215040	So the contest starts tonight, and if you have an MP3 you would like to submit to us, you can send that on in.
1215080	1220985	You can either send it to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, or we will set up a special page on our forums where you can send those in.
1221025	1221806	We'll pick our favorites.
1222126	1227811	The community will then vote on the winner, and then what happens is that the winning bumper goes to All Games Radio
1228351	1231432	and All Games Radio will choose the ultimate winner out of those.
1231712	1239173	But hey, the good news is just for winning from us, you get an All Games t-shirt and a $25 gift certificate to shop.allgames.com.
1239433	1242114	They sell video games, so that's like half off a video game right there.
1242214	1243074	So go for it.
1243794	1244814	Submission starts tonight.
1244854	1249115	You have to have these in by May 4th at midnight Pacific time.
1249515	1251195	No late entries accepted.
1251875	1254916	I know many of you listen to several shows on allgames.com.
1255356	1270019	you can submit multiple entries per multiple shows but keep in mind you'll probably have to do different bumpers because you know since we're making you have something related to Orange Lounge Radio for example Electric Sista Hood would probably want something relating to their show and so on and so on
1271579	1288100	we have the right to play your submission on our show blah blah blah if one person should win multiple contests a coin flip determines the winner open to North American residents only I'm sorry US and Canada only it's an NTSC console so we can't give it to Europe those are the rules sorry Europe
1288413	1290875	Yeah, we can't really give it to anybody else because it's going to me.
1291676	1295339	Unfortunately, cast and crew of the participating affiliate shows are not eligible.
1295399	1295960	Sorry, Loki.
1297942	1301585	And last but not least, no copywritten materials permitted in the entry.
1301665	1302686	Parody is fine.
1302986	1309492	You can't use, like, if you want to play Welcome to the Jungle, you have to, like, sing it yourself or something or, you know, Welcome to the Radio or something.
1309512	1309752	I don't know.
1309772	1311474	You have to sing a makeup thing.
1311874	1312675	So there you have it.
1313636	1315620	Actdeft is asking, what about Mexico?
1315920	1318004	I will have to ask the official judges about that.
1318425	1320228	I think that counts as North America.
1320408	1323394	I think that's okay, but I will get the final ruling on that shortly.
1324375	1325798	Decisions of the judges are final.
1325858	1326279	No bitching.
1327366	1333307	If you like the full list of rules, they are available on forums.allgames.com and we'll be posting them on our site soon.
1333387	1336508	So that's like, what, like $500 prize right there?
1336528	1337388	It's nice stuff.
1337829	1343790	There's prizes for second and third place too, but if I told you that tonight, I'd have nothing to tell you about next week when we plug the contest again.
1343830	1344790	So get working on it.
1344850	1347351	A two-minute commercial parody.
1347871	1352692	Orange Lounge Radio, anything that would happen in one of those little radio bits in the Grand Theft Auto game.
1352732	1353212	Be creative.
1353472	1361474	Hey, if you want, if you don't have a fancy recording studio set up in your place, you can also leave it on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1361494	1364395	When we're not live, you can call in and leave a bumper there.
1364455	1366575	So don't say you don't have many different ways to send this in.
1366655	1371837	It's all futile anyways because, like I said and stated again, the console's going to me.
1372597	1373677	Even though you're ineligible.
1373857	1374817	Even though I'm ineligible.
1374837	1376678	Hell, I'm not even entering and it's going to me.
1376778	1376978	So...
1378115	1378796	Marvel vs. Capcom
1396056	1397917	SubZero Staring Down Batman Midways Gamer Day
1413781	1418323	and they were showing off a trailer featuring Sub-Zero fighting Batman.
1418923	1432088	And the game itself, I don't know, I'm not a huge Mortal Kombat fan, but flying through the air while punching each other or falling, it's kind of hokey, but that's just my opinion, you know, whatever.
1432289	1435650	It made me think of the more recent Dead or Alive games.
1436129	1444575	All I gotta say is, I hope they have villains in there as well, other than just... Because I think it would be pretty badass if they had a cool version of Joker in there.
1444875	1446136	Okay, that might be pretty cool.
1446396	1449358	It might also be in horrible taste, though, to play a fatality on the Joker.
1450003	1450724	Okay, shut up.
1450804	1453525	Okay, fucking Jack Nicklaus is still alive.
1453585	1456627	Who cares if, you know... Jack Nicklaus was a golf player.
1456667	1457388	You mean Jack Nicholson?
1457748	1458449	Nicholson, whatever.
1458789	1462051	Hey, little did you know, Jack Nicklaus was actually Joker at one time.
1462071	1468775	And then Jack Nicholson... It's just... All these things you don't know about movies, Rob.
1469116	1473158	Look, I said this on Bobby's show when we were doing our little tease before we went live tonight.
1473939	1478562	The thing is that obviously this game is not going to have fatalities because it's going for a teen rating or whatever, right?
1478622	1478742	But...
1479342	1481683	and people are like, oh my god, I can't believe it.
1481723	1483965	What's a Mortal Kombat game without fatalities?
1483985	1487667	It's kind of sacrilegious to be able to perform a fatality on Wonder Woman.
1487907	1488247	Come on.
1488527	1489247	Or on Batman.
1489367	1491028	I mean, you can't decapitate Batman.
1491048	1491629	You just can't.
1492109	1493310	You can break Batman's back.
1494070	1495951	You can do a friendship on Batman all you want.
1495971	1496931	In fact, that might be kind of funny.
1496951	1498092	You can break his back.
1498112	1499793	That would be hilarious because that's what happened to him.
1499813	1500413	I think they should be mature.
1500433	1501214	I mean, come on.
1501334	1502855	Stop pussying out, DC.
1502895	1503715	Seriously.
1503735	1506617	Somebody said in chat earlier you could kill Superman but he'd just come back.
1507077	1507317	Yeah.
1509615	1510396	I don't know.
1511416	1512637	It's just sacrilegious.
1513377	1514217	Don't ask me why.
1514297	1517759	It's just something about seeing your childhood hero get decapitated as all kinds of wrong.
1518119	1519279	Now, here's a question for you.
1519319	1524982	Can you think of any game whatsoever that's had Superman in it that's been any good?
1526969	1530513	Superman on the Atari 2600 when I was five years old was the shit.
1530573	1531594	Okay, well that doesn't count.
1532174	1532655	Why not?
1533195	1535057	You said name a Superman video game that was good.
1535077	1538020	Okay, I was thinking, I don't know, within this decade.
1538100	1539581	There was that Justice League game.
1539642	1540983	That wasn't very good.
1542064	1544046	It was better than the straight Superman games.
1544346	1547568	All the games that Superman has ever touched, crap.
1547988	1549248	So, I'm sorry.
1549548	1550709	This isn't going to be very good.
1550909	1551949	And it's Superman's fault.
1552290	1554331	He should have stayed dead like a good superhero.
1554591	1562354	Instead of a fatality, I'm thinking the game will have nudalities where the characters are forced to don their own underoos.
1562374	1564655	I don't know.
1565716	1567116	I guess that wouldn't get a teen rating, though.
1567136	1568517	I hope the Wonder Twins are in it.
1569997	1576162	Well, all I can say is this is going to come out and be yet another mediocre Mortal Kombat game.
1577803	1581787	Am I the only one that actually enjoys Mortal Kombat's combat system?
1582267	1585990	I kind of liked how you could switch between the fighting styles and the weapons.
1586390	1589913	I actually kind of enjoy the Mortal Kombat games, not just for the fatalities.
1590013	1593276	If I'm to be fair, though, I don't like Street Fighter either, so, you know.
1596610	1602196	I like the fact that everything was hand-drawn stuff in Marvel vs. Capcom.
1602236	1610204	Hell, if they wanted to do a 2D fighter with the Mortal Kombat characters all hand-drawn, and not really Mortal Kombat style, but kind of ripping off SNK or Capcom,
1612486	1614268	DC Comics Marvel vs. DC Fighter Marvel vs. DC Fighter
1637080	1638741	All right, let's read comments from chat room.
1638841	1641703	SSJ100, Matt wants to point out, there was a good Superman arcade game.
1642824	1650889	Ranma says, mind you, Mortal Kombat vs. DC idea has been around since Marvel vs. Capcom, which is funny because I know it's been brought up on this show before.
1650929	1655252	I want to say this whole thing was in rumor state a couple months ago, and we joked about it then.
1656153	1661556	Ranma continues, and as much as I'm not too thrilled about not having fatalities, Mortal Kombat vs. DC does not need it.
1661857	1665879	Yes, the fandom will be pissed off, but the DC fandom is bigger than the Mortal Kombat fandom,
1667420	1668861	Here's what's going to happen.
1668881	1671622	This game is going to be in development right now.
1671782	1673003	It's scheduled out for the fall.
1673243	1674424	What movie is coming out this summer?
1675504	1676125	The Dark Knight.
1676505	1678826	What movie is going to probably be out on DVD in the fall?
1679306	1680687	Here's where the whoring begins.
1680747	1687170	They're just going to put this out at the same time as the fucking Dark Knight movie, and they're just going to try to sell some more copies on a mediocre game.
1687270	1690812	Pardon my ignorance, I don't follow comic books, but is Iron Man DC or Marvel?
1690952	1691312	Marvel.
1691452	1691992	Oh, never mind.
1692012	1692713	That's not related.
1693916	1696276	because I was going to say there's the Iron Man movie coming out too, but I guess that's old.
1696296	1697117	That's Marvel.
1697157	1698297	That's Marvel whoring.
1698437	1699097	Ah, that's why I asked.
1699117	1700577	And I'm getting the Iron Man game too.
1700617	1706658	That's Sega whoring Marvel characters like that and the Incredible Hulk.
1707319	1711379	Both games which look good, but I think are going to be mediocre.
1711579	1718181	You know, I think the last comic book I bought when I was maybe seven years old was Uncle Scrooge and Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
1718541	1719581	I have comics right here.
1720481	1720901	You know what?
1721341	1721601	What?
1722002	1723302	Best comic book game ever.
1724423	1726483	DuckTales was a pretty awesome comic book game.
1726524	1727084	Comics.
1727924	1728204	Nice.
1728404	1728664	X-Men.
1728704	1729865	Is that what a comic looks like?
1730105	1730865	It's a graphic novel.
1731065	1731265	Nice.
1731285	1732606	It's an older one, too.
1732846	1735627	That's what adults have to read nowadays because you can't read comics.
1735647	1736948	You have to read graphic novels.
1738028	1738428	Hell no.
1738488	1739229	I still buy comics.
1740529	1741310	I got to ask this.
1741430	1742650	Instapoll in chat.
1743130	1746132	There is a greater comic book game than DuckTales.
1746492	1746992	Y or N?
1750956	1754198	Meanwhile, we'll see what the Instapoll results are in a minute.
1755579	1757220	By the way, Tigerclaw wants to add this.
1757260	1769128	I don't think this is in our show role anywhere, but speaking of Mortal Kombat, I don't know if you heard this, the actor who was Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat movie, Robin Shu, he is going to be Jen in the new Street Fighter movie.
1770529	1775672	So there's that crossover there for Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter that one of the actors is going to be.
1775692	1776833	That's very loose, Rob.
1777173	1778134	I know, a little bit.
1779557	1784141	and little does he realize what kind of, you know, crap he is walking into.
1785522	1789826	Do we not forget Raul Julia and what happened to him in the last Street Fighter movie?
1791028	1792669	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1811243	1813684	Well, the Soul keeps burning on July 29th.
1813744	1817306	Soul Calibur is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
1817346	1818526	I'm sorry, not on that day.
1818606	1819627	Something else will come out that day.
1819947	1825089	On Xbox Live Arcade, though, sometime this summer, Soul Calibur is going to be coming out.
1825549	1834493	It's going to be old school because it's the Dreamcast version that's actually coming to Xbox Live Arcade, not the arcade version of Soul Calibur.
1834553	1836034	It better have the Japanese voices in it.
1836872	1837713	That would be kind of cool.
1838354	1839635	Because my man was Maxi.
1839955	1843939	It will have arcade training and survival modes in it.
1844540	1847323	And that was revealed at Namco's Gamers Day.
1847363	1848865	It is not the arcade version.
1848925	1850326	It is the Dreamcast version.
1851547	1855812	Now the question is, will it have to squeeze into that 150 megabyte limit or not?
1856793	1856953	Hmm.
1858737	1860298	So that's going to be pretty rad.
1860338	1863719	Especially if they're up the graphics to HD and all that other good stuff they usually do.
1863759	1864600	That's going to be pretty rad.
1864640	1865180	Don't you think, Jamie?
1865300	1866561	I think that would be fairly pretty.
1867541	1871603	Soul Calibur is also, remember, the game that gave us Rod Calibur.
1873104	1874865	Now we just, well, that's the next question.
1875405	1878446	Will we be able to use other interesting control devices on the Xbox 360?
1878667	1882088	See, there isn't a fishing rod controller for that.
1882128	1883409	No, but there's the Scenic controller.
1884414	1885495	That would be cool.
1886195	1889738	We should have a contest.
1889798	1892520	The rock band drums.
1892580	1894041	Guitar caliber.
1894761	1897263	We want guitar caliber.
1897403	1900665	I played Soul Calibur with my DDR pads.
1901406	1904968	My first DDR I owned was the Dreamcast DDR.
1905028	1910312	The only analog button on there was the Konami logo to put it into SSR.
1910905	1914629	and the question being asked in our chat room by none other than Bobby Blackwolf.
1914689	1916331	In other words, will it blend?
1917913	1920596	It's a very good question, will it blend?
1920656	1924821	Here's the results of our quick poll and then we'll get to more Soul Calibur news courtesy of Jamie.
1925883	1928826	Quick poll was, is there a comic book game better than DuckTales?
1928866	1929527	Here are the results.
1930309	1937312	N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, Y, X-Men Mutant Apocalypse.
1937692	1939273	It's all about maximum carnage.
1939313	1939873	I missed that one.
1940554	1941894	Y, Superman 64.
1943055	1944575	X-Men Arcade is a close second.
1945216	1947957	N, Y, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighters.
1948577	1951038	N, N, DuckTales freaking rocked.
1951619	1952519	Y, X-Men Arcade.
1953578	1955900	The X-Men arcade game was really, really good.
1956881	1960264	Looks like the majority do believe DuckTales is the greatest comic book game ever made, though.
1960284	1961805	That kind of surprises me.
1961865	1964007	I can't count DuckTales as a comic book game.
1964247	1967450	I think of the show.
1967790	1973455	There wasn't a DuckTales comic book until I think six months after the show had already been out for a while.
1974076	1978459	So technically it was based off of... That question is actually invalid.
1978619	1980121	So our entire poll was a crock of shit.
1980481	1982942	The entire poll wasn't just a crock of shit.
1983703	1987425	It was a crock of compost.
1987505	1989826	Well, then why don't you take us back to reality, Miss Summers?
1990146	1991687	Okay, but I prefer unreality.
1991727	1992968	So how about more Soul Calibur news?
1996294	2003039	Soul Calibur 4 is going to be out on July 29th and there will be a regular and a premium edition.
2003059	2003740	What you talk about, Jamie?
2003760	2005882	Soul Calibur 3 was awesome.
2018322	2024685	Drew, you could make, was it the Pope, or was it the Pope character they made, or was that in Moral Combat?
2025225	2026506	The Pope was in Soul Calibur 3.
2029027	2030287	So Tansel's Pope.
2032868	2035910	I had a lot of friends actually make custom characters for that.
2036510	2040291	That was the only thing I wanted, and I don't know if this one's going to have any customized.
2042012	2046014	The Special Edition, I think, was going to have some sort of thing for that.
2046479	2054182	Well, anyway, you're going to get your choices of different characters like Darth Vader and Yoda and a bunch of other people.
2054902	2055843	And no spawn.
2057343	2058144	That's okay, though.
2060585	2060805	But...
2063064	2080493	is of course different versions are going to have different characters like the Playstation 3 one will have Darth Vader, Xbox 360 one will have Yoda but there are but like you were saying the premium edition is going to have the extra customization content and a tournament kit and that will retail for $79.99
2082594	2083615	Okay, Quandary.
2084535	2087977	I'm getting my stimulus check, like we all are, hopefully, pretty soon, right?
2088017	2089979	And I'm thinking, hmm, $600.
2090059	2093521	Perfect amount to finally take the splurge and buy my damn PlayStation 3, right?
2093541	2097683	Because you know there's going to be all this crap around Christmas time I'm going to want, including home, right?
2098324	2111172	So here's the thing, is that... Here's where I'm stuck, is that I don't know whether to get Soul Calibur 3 for the PlayStation 3 or Xbox, because I do think Vader is cooler than Yoda, so I kind of want the PlayStation 3 version based on that alone, but...
2111972	2116694	I know on Xbox Live, the online is going to have to be better on Xbox Live.
2116714	2117714	Well, yeah.
2118414	2120735	And there's going to be more people and there's achievements and so on.
2121075	2121776	So what do I do?
2122236	2125097	I know you guys are both buy in your console ownings.
2125517	2126137	What do you think?
2127018	2128498	Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3?
2128738	2130099	I'm going to put the same question in chat.
2130119	2131239	That's another mini quick poll.
2131979	2136301	Only for those of you guys that own both systems, which one are you getting Soul Calibur 3 on and why, if you're buying it?
2136401	2137582	Or Soul Calibur 4, what the hell?
2137802	2138662	Soul Calibur 4 and why?
2139261	2146145	I'm thinking that we'll probably go with the Xbox 360 edition just because Yoda is comical fighting.
2147947	2152409	But again, it's like you said, there's going to be more content out.
2152450	2157593	Plus, I also think that the Xbox 360 controller is just a little more comfortable for a fighting game.
2158313	2158854	That's just me.
2160715	2160875	Loki?
2162898	2165499	I wouldn't buy a system for that game.
2165839	2167079	I'm not going to buy the system for the game.
2167099	2168360	I want the system for other stuff, too.
2168440	2170921	But I'm just saying, if I'm going to have the system anyway.
2171121	2172981	I wouldn't buy the system until Home comes out.
2173221	2174222	Trust me.
2174662	2175282	Because who knows?
2175542	2178063	Seriously, this summer, they may be trying to drive sales.
2178103	2179464	They may drop the price again.
2180564	2181565	Let me confess.
2181725	2185106	I'm eyeing the whole gray metal MGS4 bundle.
2185626	2187567	Alright, good luck finding that.
2188467	2205833	I would say, you know, I guess I could be sort of biased towards the 360, but only because you should really look at the game more than just one character, and I know that Darth Vader's cool and all, but if you want to play Darth Vader kicking ass, just buy Force Unleashed when that comes out.
2206353	2206833	But, um...
2208163	2208523	I don't know.
2208964	2214167	Really, how much did you... Well, I guess, you know, Soul Calibur 2, I mean, Link was pretty popular and stuff like that.
2214247	2215228	See, exactly.
2215308	2217909	Like, you had to have Soul Calibur 2 on the GameCube because of Link.
2217969	2218530	Hands down.
2219150	2219751	Hands down.
2220731	2221392	Anyway.
2221432	2223213	We actually have all of those.
2223649	2226310	All right, let's look at the chat room, what they thought.
2226390	2228410	J-Rod says, PlayStation 3 equals Vader.
2228470	2229551	Vader greater than all.
2229911	2231411	Black Wolf says, I'm getting the PlayStation 3.
2231691	2233412	Yes, I have both because of Vader.
2233992	2237233	J-Rod says, the only way to get more people on PlayStation Network is to buy the PlayStation 3.
2238813	2241034	J-Rod says, Soul Calibur 4 is PlayStation 3 for me.
2243874	2244335	Let's see.
2246727	2248828	HitStun says you have to have Yoda versus Vader.
2249308	2251248	Queltipo says 360, fuck Vader.
2253849	2258551	Sephiroth1215 says the PlayStation 3 version is better for Vader and the control is much better for Soul Calibur.
2261511	2262892	Jrod answered the question like five times.
2262912	2263372	It's throwing me off.
2263692	2267193	FootyMonster said if I get it, I'm going to go 360 because that's what I own.
2267473	2268994	Plus, Yoda greater than Vader.
2269054	2270214	Yes, I said it, bitches.
2271094	2273035	And RawSteelUT says stop hating the PlayStation 3, Loki.
2274110	2279795	I don't hate the PS3, it's just, once again, they've got the achievement system built in already.
2279815	2282857	I have more friends that are on the 360.
2283698	2292845	I'll be getting exclusive games for the PS3 when those come out, just right now, if there's a game coming out on both platforms, I'm going to get it on the 360.
2295240	2299745	And who's to say, like Bobby said before, who's to say that they could possibly, you know, add these as download content later on for the other systems?
2299765	2299945	True.
2299965	2301086	You never know.
2301106	2302167	So, you know, that could be all for naught.
2317338	2325763	And of course, why would they pass up the opportunity to whore out themselves a little bit and sell the characters for an extra five bucks on top of the game?
2325803	2328124	I mean, I could see them doing that.
2328284	2330265	Especially now that we have download content available.
2331406	2332166	Time will tell.
2332246	2342252	I would see them, not so much the Vader-Yoda thing, but maybe bringing back classic Soul Calibur characters who maybe don't make the cut for Soul Calibur 4 or always were intended to be downloadables or something.
2342812	2343873	This should be a special mode.
2345267	2345607	We'll see.
2346088	2347491	Or what do you want to bet?
2347511	2350957	If this custom creator thing is in it, that's where your download content is going to be.
2351057	2352240	Download new pants.
2352642	2355885	But the special mode should be the Kill Voldo mode.
2357226	2358187	Again and again and again?
2358547	2358848	Oh, yes.
2359528	2359828	Again.
2360129	2362130	Replace the punching bag mode with just Voldo.
2362671	2362851	Yeah.
2363111	2363592	Alright, we'll see.
2364112	2365013	Alright, let's move on.
2365153	2365533	New game.
2365774	2372159	Well, one thing that you may be able to download content on for Soul Calibur 4 would be the brand new PlayStation Store.
2372680	2373160	That's right.
2373440	2375102	This week, after a brief
2375622	2376662	A bit of downtime.
2377082	2381143	They finally brought back the PlayStation Store with its new features and stuff.
2381183	2382423	It's a lot easier to browse.
2383283	2392465	And then finally kind of caught up on all the content that 360 owners have had for a while including still live for Rock Band and all that stuff.
2393085	2395105	So definitely worth checking out.
2395245	2399626	Also coming along with that is the brand new firmware 2.30 and that's live as well and
2405007	2405327	I don't know.
2405547	2413230	It's supposed to be enhancing DTS HD and Master High Resolution Audio.
2416831	2417671	It looks a lot better.
2417831	2420552	I didn't really care for the old PlayStation Store too much.
2421292	2432056	I still wish that those prepaid cards are out there because that would be pretty nice so I could buy some with store credit instead of having to pony up real money for PlayStation money.
2435137	2436941	So you have yet to buy anything from the new store?
2437722	2439165	Uh, not yet from the new store.
2439185	2442331	To be honest, I haven't plugged in my PlayStation 3 in quite a while.
2442812	2442992	What?
2443032	2444615	You're not helping to cure cancer even?
2445216	2445357	No.
2445497	2445978	Fuck cancer.
2447403	2453549	Well, one thing that I'm kind of surprised you haven't jumped out and downloaded, although, then again, it is kind of expensive, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.
2454330	2455851	It is now on the PSN store.
2456692	2458714	It's 1.9 gigabytes to download it.
2459295	2461017	40 bucks if you want to download this.
2461177	2462118	Buy the full game.
2462138	2463459	At least you get a case with it.
2463559	2468824	And if you stop playing it later on, you can sell it for, you know, money.
2469765	2479768	The weird thing is that the intro video and the ending videos don't come with the game when you download it, but you can download them later to view, which is kind of strange.
2479808	2482509	You can only get the ending video, of course, after you've beaten Gran Turismo.
2483289	2492112	There's a whole documentary as well, Beyond the Apex, which is apparently only on the Blu-ray version of the game, so I guess if you want a documentary, you have that as well.
2492312	2495214	But seriously though, that's the only thing I could see.
2495854	2506280	I know why they offered these games available to download, but if they're offering a disc version of it, I don't understand why people don't buy the disc version of the game since that's the thing.
2506700	2512803	You may get tired of playing this game later on, or say for example, you want to sell it off before Gran Turismo 5 comes out.
2513804	2515625	You can't do that with the download version.
2515665	2516305	You have to
2516525	2518346	I can think of maybe two reasons.
2518606	2522669	One, convenience, especially for those that may live in the middle of nowhere where it's harder to get to a store.
2522909	2524590	Your only option is like Walmart, right?
2525451	2528513	Two, no sales tax in some places.
2529073	2533416	I don't know if, because I know on Nintendo, if you live in California, you don't get charged sales tax on Wii Points.
2533436	2534297	Same thing with Xbox.
2534377	2538260	So I don't think on PlayStation, which uses real money, I don't think you get charged sales tax.
2539160	2539801	Okay, great.
2539841	2541242	So you save a few bucks there.
2541862	2542362	Just saying.
2542582	2546125	I'm just saying, though, wouldn't you rather have a case and all that stuff for it?
2547105	2548306	I don't know.
2548326	2553888	If a game came out on the Xbox Live Arcade and I had a choice of downloading it or buying it in a store, I'd buy it in a store.
2555609	2556429	That's just me, I guess.
2556549	2557530	What about the PopCap game?
2557550	2559210	Well, I guess those didn't come out until way later, too.
2559230	2560551	Yeah, they didn't come out until way later.
2560891	2562552	I mean, I don't know.
2563314	2567317	RossDLUT is pointing out in chat, Rob, the middle of nowhere isn't going to have broadband.
2567417	2568318	I guess that's kind of true.
2568398	2569839	Well, yes and no.
2570039	2577364	I think broadband's really spreading out more and more, especially as, isn't satellite in some form starting to support like a broadband-esque type of connection?
2577384	2581487	Yeah, and really, really middle of nowhere, there's always going to be a Walmart around.
2582452	2584052	They pop up like Starbucks.
2584192	2587533	Alright, maybe a bad excuse, but I don't know, just trying to think.
2587633	2589994	Obviously somebody's buying it or they wouldn't be putting it out there.
2590294	2590474	True.
2590694	2593415	Well, see, I like what they did with Warhawk.
2594115	2600277	Well, originally they had it where you can buy the version in stores and it came with a Bluetooth headset.
2600397	2606839	And that was how they kind of, you know, you can do this and get all this extra stuff or if you don't want to buy that, you can just download the version of the game.
2607839	2611060	Then later on they came out with the version that's just the game only, but...
2612259	2617342	I don't know, it's still... I would rather buy it on disc, I guess.
2618223	2618523	Alright.
2619704	2622405	DarkSakura, you mentioned you and the husband got this game this week, right?
2623826	2625747	I keep wanting to say Grand Theft Auto, Gran Turismo.
2626288	2630010	Yeah, Dan was playing quite a bit of it, and he had his cousin over playing it.
2630050	2632932	I didn't really watch it, because you know me, I don't really give a crap.
2633192	2633672	Was it pretty?
2635293	2637535	I said I didn't watch any of it, because I didn't give a crap.
2638356	2640398	I thought maybe Elise glanced at it once or twice.
2640679	2641540	I looked a little bit.
2641600	2642120	It was pretty.
2642300	2645324	Alright, see, that's what I was looking for.
2645404	2648688	Did you guys actually go get the box version or did you download it?
2649428	2650750	I think that Dan bought it.
2651246	2651446	Yeah.
2652566	2654987	He probably gets a discount anyway because of the whole game store connection thing.
2655027	2655327	Yeah.
2655547	2655827	Probably.
2656347	2656587	Yeah.
2656627	2657007	Makes sense.
2657287	2659068	But he was pretty happy about it.
2659128	2664869	I mean, he was like... I was like, so why do you... And I straight out asked him, I was like, why did you want to pay money for a glorified demo?
2665649	2671810	And he's like, well, honestly, I look at this as more of a part A, you know, sort of thing.
2672390	2674191	You know, the game comes out...
2675511	2675631	Don't.
2675651	2675751	Don't.
2699960	2700861	PSP is still hot shit in Japan
2725417	2726338	I don't know why, but it is.
2727379	2734666	Right now, in order of systems sold, number 6 is the Xbox 360.
2735246	2736908	PlayStation 2 is after that.
2736948	2738149	PlayStation 3 is after that.
2738329	2740331	Wii is after that by quite a bit.
2741693	2743695	Let me actually just go back and give the numbers.
2743715	2743755	So...
2747455	2753677	Xbox 360 is at $1,147 PlayStation 2 is $6,834 PlayStation 3 is $8,232 Wii is $46,296 The DS $47,158 and PSP at $85,721 if that's going to put it into perspective as far as what was sold in the past week.
2753697	2753757	Hmm.
2775347	2802574	so just PSPs really got it now and actually I was looking through a couple of back issues of Famitsu when I was at Kinokuniya and there were plenty of PSP ads just in terms of ads there were just more and you know there's actually a couple of full just PSP only magazines so I thought that was kind of interesting Loki any thoughts on why the PSP is really taking off in Japan all of a sudden?
2802734	2804414	Monster Hunter hmm
2805120	2805461	I don't know.
2805681	2806802	They like the Monster Hunter.
2807964	2809125	Maybe Monster Hunter on PS3.
2809145	2810367	That'd be pretty awesome.
2811068	2811328	Could be.
2812669	2815031	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
2842620	2843961	No fanboy, no siree.
2844081	2844862	Not over there.
2844942	2845583	Not at all.
2845943	2848045	Hey, I just know a great game when I see it.
2850747	2851288	Not by a saw.
2851308	2852609	Are you excited that it's gone gold?
2852629	2853890	This means like no more delays.
2853950	2854871	It's really going to happen.
2855352	2855812	It's coming.
2856012	2856272	What is it?
2856313	2857414	It's only like a week away, right?
2857554	2857894	Yeah.
2857994	2858474	What's the date?
2858675	2859495	April 29th.
2860256	2863079	See, the thing is though is I'm... Are you going to make it to the show that week?
2863099	2863179	Yeah.
2864981	2867042	Yeah, well, there's a few reasons.
2867162	2869303	I'm going to Vegas that week, actually.
2869363	2870503	Oh, wow.
2870583	2879687	To go train a certain large shoe company on how to sell games.
2881092	2882493	Wait, a large shoe company?
2882853	2883153	Yes.
2883213	2884114	On how to sell games?
2884594	2884854	Yes.
2885214	2885915	Interesting.
2885935	2886155	Okay.
2886455	2888977	A certain website begins with Z. Okay.
2888997	2889057	Wow.
2889077	2889957	And ends with Epos.
2891958	2892799	Don't hold back.
2893499	2895600	So, yeah, I get to go to Vegas.
2896081	2897502	I was actually thinking about...
2899474	2904198	Bringing my 360 with me to play, you know, during... Because I'm going for a day.
2904218	2908781	We're actually training them on, like, different... Kind of giving them, like, the games 101 type shit.
2908921	2911683	I'm sure there... I'm sure we have... I know we have listeners in Vegas.
2911783	2913845	I'm sure there's some out there who would be like, Loki, come over.
2913885	2914285	We'll play.
2915826	2916767	I'll buy pizza and beer.
2916827	2917087	Come on.
2917167	2917828	But here's the thing.
2919409	2920150	My boss reminded me.
2920190	2922711	He's all, you know, there's going to be 360s there.
2922872	2925373	So you can just bring Grand Theft Auto with you.
2925414	2927195	I'm like, I know, but I want to bring it...
2928576	2930556	I don't know if I should bring it on the plane
2961775	2962615	This game rules.
2963596	2966776	This game sucks.
2967337	2968537	Your controller's kind of big.
2970738	2972138	I don't think we have anything in your size.
2973578	2974019	Let's see.
2974119	2974879	Moving on.
2975279	2977580	Another series that people are pretty into.
2977860	2979460	Who likes their survival horror?
2980020	2980661	Me.
2980761	2982101	Do you like the game Siren?
2983749	2985970	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3012522	3020648	July 24th is the day it's supposed to come out, but a demo is supposed to be out very, very soon in Japan, so if you were a fan of Siren.
3021569	3024711	To which Jrod in chat says, Siren is absolutely terrible.
3025171	3026172	Avoid it at all costs.
3026352	3032457	And they also have a big, like, Siren in the game that sounds just like the one from Silent Hill as well.
3034138	3037681	I don't want to say rip-off because the game, I think, was out before Silent Hill, so...
3038257	3039998	Queltipo says, hooray for Siren.
3040038	3042860	When nothing you do makes much sense, you just have to do it anyway.
3042900	3045742	Well, what if they go back and fix all the problems and make the graphics even prettier?
3045762	3047183	Would that make this game worth owning?
3047264	3047564	I don't know.
3047744	3052888	Hey, you know, nothing's going to hurt having another survivor horror game out there.
3052928	3054088	There really isn't that many.
3054128	3057551	Yeah, but then you just have to keep reminding yourself, Silent Hill 5 this year.
3057651	3058812	Silent Hill 5 this year.
3058992	3060593	Well, you hope it's this year.
3060753	3060993	I hope.
3061033	3061614	It better be.
3062895	3065136	Especially after seeing the little preview clips for it.
3065156	3067058	I'm so freaking excited.
3068171	3069192	It's bonerific.
3070293	3071234	I don't know if I'd go that far.
3074036	3074977	I couldn't find the article.
3075197	3075698	That's alright.
3076478	3077739	How about some different gaming news then?
3077860	3079061	How about some Rock Band?
3079321	3080202	Alrighty, I'll take it.
3080482	3089650	Well, Harmonix is going to have up a downloadable album for Rock Band that's going to be available next week.
3090390	3093753	It's called Screaming for Vengeance by Judas Priest.
3094734	3097175	It has 10 tracks that will cost $15.
3097295	3101076	It's both for PS3 and Xbox 360.
3101816	3105537	Each of the songs will be $2 a piece.
3108278	3113000	Later on, coming in May, there will be an album by The Cars and then Doolittle by The Pixies.
3113060	3113780	The Pixies are cool.
3115542	3118646	So it looks like they're just still working on trying to get those out.
3118686	3119988	I think that's kind of a neat idea.
3121130	3128742	And they said, though, that they were supposed to have The Who have a first downloadable album, but they said that that's going to be later on.
3131368	3142131	It's very interesting that they're going this download album route, especially in a day and age where, you know, I don't know, this is probably a bit of a controversial statement, but where music seems to be getting away from the albums.
3142332	3143332	I mean, sad but true.
3143392	3151314	We live in this iTunes world now where it's very easy to buy the one song that you like, and a lot of people don't ever take the time to listen to the entire album.
3151714	3156856	So I find it kind of interesting the rock band is kind of going this route where they're standing behind the albums in a way, you know?
3157881	3158983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3172048	3176009	I guess when you think about, well, in the classics, that's when the albums were really albums.
3176169	3177710	Maybe it's not so surprising.
3177750	3178050	I don't know.
3178210	3195456	Well, you know, and I also think that it's sad that we really don't have albums as a big format anymore just because from an artistic point of view, keep in mind what all went into making an album, you know, with your cover and everything and you had all the publishing.
3196516	3199037	I think that actually is sort of a...
3200655	3204157	A neat thing as far as its nostalgic value.
3204397	3205758	You know what I mean?
3205818	3206859	Looking at chat comments.
3206919	3210721	Hitstuns in chat.orangelunchradio.com says, When I download stuff, I get the whole album.
3211361	3213843	J-Rod says, Rock band needs more modern metal.
3214703	3217485	Actdeft says, I'm an iTunes boy living in an iTunes world.
3220166	3223368	Sephiroth1215 says, I'm waiting for Nevermind to come out.
3223408	3224709	I'll get the whole album for that.
3226490	3226830	We'll see.
3228419	3231743	That would be classic, classic rock, especially for this generation.
3231783	3234766	You know, that early 90s stuff is really the defining classic rock.
3234806	3235587	It's kind of interesting.
3236048	3237209	It's interesting.
3237590	3238170	It's interesting.
3238571	3238811	I know.
3239311	3239672	I know.
3239752	3240413	We're getting old.
3241053	3241874	We ain't getting any younger.
3242708	3248450	But hey, while we age, we have a lot of new games and things coming out around the world to look forward to, so let's do some release dates.
3249070	3252512	Yes, this week, actually, there's going to be something pretty cool.
3252832	3257314	Well, about a week from now, there'll be something pretty cool, because it's going to be coming out on Sunday.
3257714	3263276	Mario Kart Wii, finally coming out in the U.S., so you can take a look at that.
3263916	3264577	Very good game.
3265757	3269518	Let's see, other things coming out other than Mario Kart Wii...
3271334	3276797	There is a game actually also on the Wii, little known, Heavenly Guardian.
3277397	3282960	It's a pretty cheap game, and it's kind of like a side-scroller shooter game, so that's kind of cool.
3283921	3294846	There's also NBA Ballers Chosen One, which is coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, kind of a one-on-one, two-on-two basketball game.
3296387	3297988	Let's see, there's also...
3301850	3303556	RiverKingMysticValley
3304861	3307864	and that's like a fishing game, fishing RPG.
3307884	3312227	I guess it's what Harvest Moon is to farming, this is to fishing.
3313228	3315370	Battle of the Bands coming out on the Wii.
3315590	3321975	That's that music game that doesn't require instruments but you have different mashups of music genres in there.
3323857	3324878	This is kind of cool.
3325358	3327560	Wild Earth African Safari.
3327580	3328060	That's right.
3328220	3331483	It's the Pokemon Snap type of game that's for the Wii.
3331963	3333865	It's the Africa before Africa.
3334639	3335680	The World Ends With You James Bond
3353581	3355682	I think that came up on last week's show.
3355702	3357323	We were talking about The World Ends With You.
3357923	3358523	James Bond.
3358543	3360264	This totally sounds like a Bond.
3360364	3362365	This game you may want to skip.
3362685	3365006	Target Terror by Konami.
3365026	3367387	Apparently one of the ugliest games for the Wii.
3367727	3373969	This is a game that came out of the arcades circa 1990s with wonderful mocap technology.
3374009	3377691	Kind of think of like Area 51 and Maximum Force type things.
3378581	3383263	Chameleon on PSP Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 FES Dream Pinball 3D
3398120	3399781	Lineage 2, Call of Duty 4, and I believe that's actually it.
3399841	3400341	Yep, that is it.
3416874	3420016	Jonathan F. in chat just said something I've been wondering about for the longest time.
3420097	3424720	Fantasy Star Universe, Ambition of the Illuminous, Max Attack G begins, I guess, this week.
3425020	3427162	Play the old PSO stages in PSU.
3427202	3431225	That's like the whole reason I downloaded Ambition of the Illuminous, not realizing they weren't there yet.
3431806	3434168	So, God, I hope you can do that at low level.
3434188	3436109	I hope I don't have to level, like, 100 to play them.
3436129	3437250	But I will if I have to.
3438191	3439372	I miss caves that much.
3440152	3443195	Who doesn't miss caves and those damn little plants that kept paralyzing you all the time?
3445174	3448455	Anyhow, traveling to Japan and looking at some of the releases over there.
3448715	3451476	If you're a war fan, hey, Xbox 360 is where it's at this week.
3451516	3458058	On April 24th, Frontline's Fuel of War and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 both come out in Japan.
3458098	3462239	So if you like those war shooting tech games, you might have fun with that.
3463219	3475202	In PlayStation 3, Senjo no Valkyria comes out as well from Sega this week in Japan, as well as another version of Rainbow Six Vegas, except that's just a price reduction on the PlayStation 3.
3476282	3478622	Trying to figure out what this Valkyrie game is here.
3478742	3482563	It's actually a game that we're getting over here in the fall.
3483323	3484824	It's a turn-based RPG.
3484864	3490085	It combines strategy with action, and you proceed in the game like it's a history book.
3490385	3490766	Valkyrie Profile
3506923	3508224	So it's like you make history.
3508425	3509405	That sounds kind of interesting.
3510707	3518013	Well, coming out on other systems, going over to the Nintendo Wii coming out this week, the white GameCube controller we talked about last week.
3518414	3522658	Also coming out, Osuji Sentai Clean Keeper.
3524858	3525539	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3554690	3556691	That's like a weird Captain Planet thing.
3556992	3557632	Wait, hold on.
3558693	3573964	The fairy mentions that there is a queen of pollution in school seeking to bring the school down by dirtying it and the only way to stop her is to form the Clean Keeper Squad by rescuing all the cleaning fairies and finding the girls who can see and bond with these fairies.
3574645	3576686	This game sounds badass.
3576746	3579128	I think you have to capture girls and clean them.
3583149	3585491	Osuji Sentai Clean Keeper H2O Edelbloom
3606889	3609391	Prism Arc Awake also comes out.
3610151	3612833	And lots of other games get price reductions.
3613373	3621218	Furayaki, Everybody's Golf 4, and Rim Runners gets a price reduction.
3622199	3623860	I swear to God, that's the name of a game.
3623900	3625961	Rim Rummers.
3628322	3629003	We're so immature.
3629623	3630484	Nintendo DS.
3631877	3639162	Days of Memories 2, Ako de Pon, Ikisama Horiyuki, Puzzle Mate, Summon Night,
3657315	3658535	This is a big week for DS.
3659055	3665637	Yataman DS, Bikiriori Dokiri Daisukisen de Koron.
3666917	3670658	That's sort of part of the charm of this segment is getting to hear me butcher such Japanese names.
3671418	3672198	How about PSP?
3672258	3675919	Let's see real quick if there's anything on PSP to match the amount of stuff coming out on DS this week.
3675979	3677179	Actually, there is quite a bit this week.
3677919	3678919	A lot of it's movies.
3681100	3682840	Like I Am Legend you can finally pick up.
3683926	3687590	SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 makes its way to Asia.
3688511	3691134	How about Vampire Chronicle gets a price reduction?
3691595	3692095	There you have it.
3693117	3694558	That's release dates for Japan.
3695119	3695860	Let's move over to Europe.
3703992	3718121	NBA Ballers, Chosen One on the 25th for Xbox 360, Nitro Bike on PS2, Turok, PDC World Championship, Dart 2008, SingStar Summer Party, Wii Fit, that's good, and Grand Theft Auto 4 on the 29th.
3718161	3718362	That's it.
3722085	3722225	Barf!
3722245	3722325	Barf!
3746761	3752354	On the Genesis, we get a cool RPG, Fancy Star 3 Generations of Doom.
3753898	3754319	And that's it.
3755361	3755682	All right.
3756493	3757714	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3778464	3781986	But they do have as downloadable content as we found out this week.
3782246	3785828	The five bonus songs on the Wii are just download songs from the other systems.
3786288	3797834	Dirty Little Secret by the All-American Rejects, Don't Look Back in Anger by Oasis, Rome by the B-52s, Rockaway Beach by the Ramones, and you don't have to turn out the red light for Roxanne by the police.
3798755	3799475	Good songs!
3800135	3803797	I actually own two of those five as download songs, and I don't even own that many songs.
3804517	3804698	But...
3805738	3815761	A little bit disappointing to some that they are just simply download songs from the other systems, but they will be right there on the Wii disc to offset the fact that you won't be able to download anything else for now, for a while.

3948827	3951728	For PC, a demo of Kung Fu Panda came out.
3952448	3953809	Whatever Kung Fu Panda is.
3954349	3955109	Sounds pretty awesome.
3955449	3955909	I guess.
3956189	3957110	Kung Fu Panda?
3957910	3961191	That's based on the Jack Black film, I think.
3963294	3986373	Steam brought out Rainbow Six Vegas 2 Trackmania United which gives free access to Trackmania United Forever and Trackmania United Forever was also free well the Trackmania United was 40 bucks Metabolite Ultimate Collection Juice 2 Hot Import Nights, Exo Cubes Essential Collection Heroes of Might and Magic 5 that be all are
3987864	3988584	Damn you, Jamie.
3990045	3991847	Now I have Message in a Bottle stuck in my head.
3992527	3995009	Message in a Bottle.
3995629	3997070	Message in a Bottle.
3997090	3999091	This is my favorite police song ever.
3999631	4000152	Ever.
4001773	4002934	And the ferret agrees too.
4004515	4005695	That was not Message in a Bottle.
4005715	4006636	That was gibberish.
4007056	4008157	That was gibberish and a ferret.
4008517	4014621	Alright, so we know that Mario Kart is already out now in Japan and Europe.
4015376	4016497	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4032586	4059533	and it's another, not really a game but a UMD video Bokudaki no Kajitsu and that actually translates to Only My Fruit and it's an erotic like hentai UMD video or game or something so that's kind of funny erotic PSP game beats out Mario Kart Wii if only they had more jubblies in Mario Kart Wii maybe
4061277	4065926	Nintendo is, uh, sending out an SOS about right now.
4067952	4069413	Seriously, how to get beaten by porn.
4069693	4072794	I mean, is this like something that's really, really popular in Japan or something?
4072974	4073974	Yeah, Akihabara.
4075495	4079096	Wait, but this is only one store's chart, right?
4079136	4080696	This isn't like the whole country's chart.
4080716	4081497	This is Akihabara.
4081717	4088599	Alright, so maybe it's a little bit much to say that OMG, Mario Kart Wii gets its butt kicked by porn in the entirety of Japan.
4088879	4089699	No, it's just one store.
4090060	4092380	And maybe this is the only store where you can buy this particular game.
4092761	4096762	Sort of like how here, you know, Walmarts and Targets don't carry certain games, right?
4097182	4098163	Yeah, maybe.
4098183	4100125	If they only carried more porn games, you know.
4102467	4102827	Who knows?
4103107	4103427	We'll see.
4125746	4131350	Now, it's only announced for Japan right now, but if this sells over in Japan, I don't see why they wouldn't bring this over here.
4131410	4136734	Like I said, Resident Evil 4, we didn't do too bad, so why the hell not?
4139196	4139616	There you have it.
4140436	4149483	Well, there has been an ESRB game rating released because of blood and fantasy violence, and it's set for something on the Nintendo DS.
4150263	4151124	Can we guess what that is?
4152305	4152485	Huh.
4153581	4160664	Castlevania Order of Ecclesia All games have fantasy violence But the best ones have real violence
4178979	4180561	None of them have real violence.
4180681	4182123	It's all fantasy.
4182643	4189731	It's all you perceiving one character beating up another, but it's just fucking data.
4190612	4191273	You know what, though?
4191413	4194016	Whattheyplay.com Snap will have real violence.
4194036	4194597	But will it blend?
4194617	4195858	We hope.
4195938	4196299	We hope.
4197728	4200570	I don't know if it'll blend since it's an idea.
4200751	4203853	I don't think you can get ideas into a blender.
4204654	4205114	Just yet.
4205594	4209357	Maybe a new blender with idea blending capabilities.
4209838	4210338	You never know.
4213201	4214241	I don't know if this will blend.
4214281	4215643	It may blend on the Wii.
4216203	4224410	But apparently Namco has announced another, yes, there is actually another already, cheerleader game for the Wii.
4224530	4225771	It's called Wii Cheer.
4226251	4227052	It features...
4228592	4232835	and cartoony cheerleaders jumping around and stuff.
4232935	4238519	And you apparently use the game, each one of your pom-poms, I guess, in the game is actually a Wii remote.
4238559	4247825	So you use two Wii remotes and kind of think like a Wii version of yet another cheering game, Oh and Done, or Elite Beat Agents.
4247965	4250247	It's kind of like that is how you play the game.
4251308	4254370	I would be interested in this if they had just called it Bring It On, the game.
4256570	4278472	and it forces you to use spirit fingers spirit fingers that movie was was incredible I don't know that's the only way you're allowed to finish that sentence don't get me wrong this is this is like I guess a cool idea for girls because um the video the trailer showed girls playing this game why's it gotta be an only a girl game huh
4279013	4281194	Well, because they showed little girls playing the game.
4281434	4283015	Do you want to play a game that little girls play?
4283135	4284935	Maybe.
4286016	4286536	I don't know.
4286636	4290478	This is kind of... I don't think I can play this game.
4290518	4292338	I would feel dirty playing this game.
4293419	4295100	Okay, I got to look at some of this trailer.
4297781	4300022	Oh, little girls dancing and happy.
4302523	4304263	This makes horrible radio.
4304303	4305764	They butcher the songs, by the way.
4310359	4312679	So they're probably going to be all horrible cover versions.
4316260	4317500	Create your own cheerleader.
4317540	4318601	Jamie, custom mode.
4318621	4319121	Look at that.
4319481	4321721	You like that, don't you?
4321881	4323442	I'd probably make a cheerleader.
4323482	4324862	I'll end the torture for our chat.
4324902	4327722	Killer or something.
4327762	4329363	They look like they're all having fun.
4330743	4332123	That's what games are all about, right?
4332143	4334064	Because they're paid to look like they're having fun.
4335384	4336364	What was the game called again?
4337014	4337734	We cheer.
4338014	4338734	We cheer.
4339615	4340515	Just like we ski.
4342115	4342795	We cheer.
4342955	4344856	We starve ourselves to fit in the outfit.
4345716	4348057	They do kind of look like they have starved themselves.
4348737	4349437	They're children.
4350377	4350737	Be nice.
4351397	4352878	They're children on TV.
4353158	4358799	Then they'll have the, you know, we need to get to Dallas, the WDS Dallas sequel for the game.
4363168	4365808	Fireboma says Sky sold as soon as he hears that song.
4366109	4366909	It is a good song.
4367149	4368009	Who doesn't like that song?
4368769	4369989	Don't it feel good?
4370629	4372110	I actually am really annoyed by that song.
4374950	4376971	Well, poop on you.
4377791	4378751	Sorry, Debbie Downer.
4384972	4388073	Channel Z says they show a boy playing at the end of the WeCheer video.
4388353	4389353	Boys can be cheerleaders.
4389693	4390073	Why not?
4391437	4392878	Smart boys are cheerleaders.
4394239	4394760	You know why?
4394780	4395260	Why?
4395300	4398743	Because they get to put their hands up the girls' skirts all day long.
4402365	4402786	All right.
4403006	4403466	Touche.
4404607	4404807	Huh?
4404887	4405868	How can you respond to that?
4405928	4406429	You can't.
4406589	4407089	Exactly.
4407729	4408010	All right.
4408130	4409771	If you saw Bring It On, you'd know this.
4409831	4412773	There was the gay cheerleader who was, you know, cheerleading because he was gay.
4413054	4416156	And then there was the cheerleader who was, you know, just there to hit on all the women.
4417377	4417957	Yeah, that's the thing.
4418017	4420079	He can hit on all the women, but he ain't going to get any of them.
4421368	4421669	Alright.
4424814	4426797	Let's look at another game here.
4426977	4428920	It's Okami on the Wii.
4429481	4432186	And the funny thing about Okami on the Wii is that...
4433837	4433897	I.G.N.
4458914	4467878	In other words, Capcom lifted the IGN art from the website or whatever to make the Wii box art for Okami.
4469499	4470999	Isn't that funny?
4471019	4473260	They stole their own artwork from a website.
4473340	4474401	I think that's really funny.
4474481	4475161	I don't know why.
4477564	4480345	and apparently it's legit.
4480485	4482646	You can go look at a box for this game and it's there.
4482967	4490090	I don't know if they'll be able to fix it at one point but at some point later but apparently the press releases that have gone out already have this on there.
4490350	4491170	People have confirmed it.
4492091	4492631	There you have it.
4493992	4496553	Frisbee in chat says Capcom googled their own box art.
4496573	4497293	Apparently they did.
4499214	4499694	There you have it.
4499874	4500755	Someone's getting fired.
4501135	4502175	Someone totally got fired.
4502916	4503556	Ha ha ha.
4504298	4515213	Alright, we're about ready to take a break here and go from Part A to Part B, but first, it just would not be an Orange Launch Radio Part A if we did not pay tribute to video game classics.
4515654	4519700	And we do that with a little segment here on the show called our Classic Video Game of the Week.
4522691	4528995	DarkSakura goes through her vast archives of video games and picks out one classic for you all to pay respect to.
4529455	4530876	What's it going to be this week, DarkSakura?
4531196	4531696	Strider.
4533037	4534278	Bitches better recognize.
4536800	4541042	And unfortunately, the only copy of the first level that I could find was the Genesis version.
4541442	4545665	However, this was one of the first of their eight meg titles that they brought out.
4546205	4548387	Oh, you can't start it past where the music was.
4548807	4549927	Wait, do I need to start at the very beginning?
4550208	4550428	Yeah!
4553962	4554723	Yeah, right there.
4556224	4557105	This is classic.
4557926	4574342	But, um, this is the game that actually in Japan was called Strider Yu-Yu, and it gave us the character from Marvel vs. Capcom, but basically it's a platformer, and it's actually very interesting because all of the in-between areas...
4575223	4582709	are basically the characters speaking their native languages, but they're speaking them to each other and can apparently understand everybody else.
4583130	4585451	I guess they have translators in the future like that.
4586793	4603266	But you go through different levels, and the first one starts off, you have to fight this guy called Grandmaster Mayo, and you're going through different areas, like you start off in the Soviet Union, the next one is, I think the next level is in Siberia,
4603906	4619640	You have the Amazon Rainforest, you've got a big platform in space, and actually this is my favorite level to do because as you're going through that, you are on the ground and then gravity reverses and you're in other areas and then you have to fight this thing that you move in a circle around.
4620060	4649660	But his weapon is called a cipher, which is like a swinging tonfa-style blade, but as you get power-ups, it'll extend further, and he'll get his little mechanical animal buddies to help him out, like a falcon, and a big saber-toothed tiger, and his little things that... Okay, I don't think they actually got names until Marvel vs. Capcom came out, but the little tiny things were called Ouroboros, but that was also one of the bosses of the game, too.
4650681	4654305	Um, okay, the stages in this was, um, St.
4654365	4660512	Petersburg, um, the Siberian Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship, um, Amazon, and, um, the Third Moon.
4660993	4663375	It was just a really kind of an epic sort of game.
4664156	4669242	Um, the thing about the, um, in-between areas is that, like, um...
4670243	4684447	For example, after you fight, there's the area where you fight three girls as the bosses, and one of them is Pompu, who was also one of the helper characters in Marvel vs. Capcom, but she speaks Chinese.
4685287	4687448	The bounty hunter guy speaks English.
4687508	4690249	I see they didn't do it on the...
4692159	4695900	on the Genesis one, the arcade one.
4697021	4717487	It also, there were other versions that came out, like the one that we were listening to was the Genesis one, but it's been on the Amiga, the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and there's been a Master System version and a Sharp X68000 version.
4717527	4717807	There was...
4723951	4729357	We actually have a burn of this, the version that was going to be Super Graphics CD.
4733402	4739449	We actually have a copy of the proto for it, but we don't have the arcade card to play it with.
4743013	4747840	I will tell people that there is a Nintendo version.
4749181	4758093	However, just to let people know, that was actually based off of the Strider comics that came out in Japan and is not anything like...
4759294	4769861	It's very interesting because when I, you know, I didn't have a Genesis growing up, we only had a Nintendo, but I do remember Strider on the Nintendo, and I love that game, but it is completely different than this game.
4770161	4774604	This game is more of like a platformer, whereas Strider on the NES was a bit more like adventure.
4775024	4780628	Yeah, it was a bit more Bionic Commando, and that fucking triangle jump made me want to kill people.
4781108	4786871	But, I mean, it's so interesting that you have both games that were Strider, yet they were so completely freaking different.
4786911	4787692	This is very interesting.
4787952	4800061	Well, part of the reason with this was they were actually going to leave out the, um, as far as I'm aware, now this is coming from my husband, and for anyone who kept up on older video game sites, my husband used to run one called Neo Strider Strider Zone.
4800781	4803984	And I did all, I, you know, fixed all of his graphics on it for him.
4804624	4805145	But, um...
4806185	4809686	Dan is full of Strider trivia.
4809746	4817128	When they were first going to bring it out on Genesis slash Mega Drive, there wasn't enough memory to accommodate the full game.
4817148	4821830	They were going to leave out the Amazon level and ended up just creating their 8MB cartridges to...
4824504	4828647	And I have to say, it's pretty damn close to arcade perfect.
4841866	4843287	Journey from Darkness, Strider Returns
4866678	4871984	and, um, a lot, it plays basically just like Striders, a lot of the same type of game.
4872524	4880333	Um, it did get a really good sequel called Strider 2, which was really freaking good, um, but that'll be touched on at a later date.
4882972	4885173	So Strider 2 is different than Strider Returns?
4886093	4890094	Yeah, Strider Returns was more of a... It was just awful.
4892055	4895376	In fact, the story that it brought up was actually retconned because of Strider 2.
4895896	4897157	The real Strider 2 that came out.
4898277	4902618	and the one that came out was, I think, a worthy sequel.
4902838	4903798	Oh, that's the Amazon level.
4905019	4908619	When you fight the girls that... This is someone doing a speedrun of the game.
4909139	4912980	They use the emulator cheats, though, but it's a speedrun in seven and a half minutes.
4913200	4914961	He's fighting the half-naked Amazon ladies.
4915121	4915381	Hot.
4915401	4916441	All right, well, there you have it.
4916461	4923223	Your classic game of the week, Strider, for the arcade and the Genesis or Mega Drive, whatever region you happen to live in.
4924163	4924603	Check it out.
4926044	4926504	Respect the Classics.
4948604	4953350	that had the NES version of Strider, Bionic Commando, and Mighty Final Fight.
4953870	4956113	So that's also another way that people can check it out.
4956493	4957174	All right, very cool.
4957194	4960438	And besides that, Mighty Final Fight is just fun, too.
4961039	4962020	Yeah, it's kind of silly fun.
4962581	4964283	It's basically chibi Final Fight.
4964323	4965484	At least it had Guy in it, right?
4965704	4967266	It did, yeah.
4967386	4968608	That's why I had Final Fight Guy.
4969119	4971400	Alright, we're going to go ahead and take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
