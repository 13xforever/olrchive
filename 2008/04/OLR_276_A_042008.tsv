0	19360	Tonight, April 20th, 2008, Rock Band is set to get its first full albums, Soul Caliber
19360	24240	the Original is headed to Xbox Live Arcade, and did a recent video game release borrow
24240	31600	its box art from the internet.
31600	35480	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35480	36480	Radio.
36480	40840	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture
40840	42600	and the gamer lifestyle.
42600	47160	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,
47160	48160	Jamie Summers.
48160	49160	Hi.
49160	50160	And how are you, Jamie?
50160	51480	I'm a little tired.
51480	53800	I'm sorry to hear about the tiredness.
53800	58040	I can tell you're quiet and you seem like your energy is depleted a little bit.
58040	61360	Well, a happy late birthday to you, Ms. Jamie Summers.
61360	65680	I know this weekend was your birthday and I guess you're just too exhausted from all
65680	66680	the partying, huh?
66680	73800	I went to San Francisco for Sakura Matsuri and I was very sad because it was so windy
73800	77000	that all the blossoms had been blown off of the trees except for a few.
77000	78000	Oh no.
78000	83040	But I did a lot of shopping and they changed Kinokuniya.
83040	84040	Hmm.
84040	88720	It has a whole anime manga stuff section downstairs.
88720	89720	Interesting.
89720	95720	But that's where all the fanboys were but that's also where all the Copic markers and
95720	97680	the leader pads were so I had to go down there.
97680	99840	I noticed you brought back a video game magazine, All in Japanese.
99840	100840	It looks like Famitsu magazine.
100840	102760	I brought back last month's issue of Famitsu.
102760	103760	Nice.
103760	108760	And I brought back the first issue of the Blue Dragon manga which is interesting.
108760	112120	Yeah, I was thumbing through it and I'm like, this looks to have nothing in common with
112120	113120	the video games.
113120	115240	It's not done by Toriyama.
115240	116480	Interesting.
116480	118600	And I brought back a bunch of comics.
118600	120600	Cool, cool.
120600	123880	We noticed you're getting a lot of belated happy birthdays in our chat room.
123880	125760	Thank you everybody else in the chat room.
125760	129640	And if you want to join us, chat.orangelaungeradio.com is the place to be even though we do tape
129640	135220	live on all games radio, we do use a separate chat room still, our old chat room, so chat.orangelaungeradio.com
135220	138200	or if you're already on the game search network, it's channel Orange Lounge.
138200	140600	And I got pie today but I haven't eaten any of it.
140600	141960	Birthday pie instead of birthday cake?
141960	145120	Because my boss baked me a cake on Friday.
145120	150160	Well, not on Friday, but she brought me homemade carrot cake because carrot cake is my favorite
150160	151160	cake.
151160	152160	Nice.
152160	153160	She baked me a cake.
153160	154160	I'm so happy.
154160	157400	That's even better than giving you a cookie is baking you a cake.
157400	158400	I got pie today.
158400	159400	Nice.
159400	160400	What kind of pie?
160400	161400	I did eat a lot of cookies though.
161400	162400	I had Samoas.
162400	163400	I love Samoas.
163400	164400	I ate them.
164400	169240	They were cold too and had Mars Bars eggs and Nestle Black Magic eggs.
169240	170240	Oh, you got to stop talking.
170240	173640	I miss all these foods ever since I had to go on the low fat diet thanks to the pancreas.
173640	174640	Pie is good for you.
174640	175640	All right.
175640	176640	Let's move on.
176640	177640	It's full of vitamin banana.
177640	180560	Let's move over and say hello to Tech Master Loki who also joins us every week.
180560	181560	Hello.
181560	182560	You're on Orange Lounge.
182560	183560	How are you?
183560	184560	I'm doing good.
184560	185560	Any cookies or pie in your day?
185560	186560	No.
186560	187560	Do you have an exciting weekend?
187560	188560	Do anything fun?
188560	194400	I waited two hours to eat at Joe's Crab Shack yesterday, I guess.
194400	195400	No, that's not fun.
195400	196400	Two hours?
196400	197400	Two hours.
197400	198880	That must have been some damn good seafood.
198880	199880	No.
199880	200880	It was.
200880	202360	We were damn patient.
202360	205200	It's really popular here, though, in Sacramento, though, because it's on the river.
205200	206200	You went to look downtown.
206200	207200	It was on the river, right?
207200	208200	It was Saturday night.
208200	213540	It was during dinner rush and they had prom people there, so, you know, people are dumb.
213540	215480	I was out of town for four days.
215480	216800	I missed Jamie's birthday, sadly.
216800	219800	I was completely out of town since Thursday.
219800	223880	I did my yearly pilgrimage out to the middle of nowhere, also known as Mendocino, which
223880	227120	is up on the north coast of California.
227120	231560	Part of it's a vacation from, you know, life, but it's also a vacation from the internets
231560	234880	and everything because there's no phone connection out there.
234880	235880	There's no internet.
235880	236880	There's no nothing.
236880	237880	Just the beach, hot tub.
237880	242440	Good times, except for the food poisoning I got that kept me in bed all day Saturday.
242440	243440	That kind of sucked.
243440	244600	Oh, well.
244600	247540	I did end up playing some video games, so I'll talk about that in a minute right after
247540	249320	we get to Dark Sakura's gaming week.
249320	251680	How was your gaming week?
251680	252680	It wasn't.
252680	256760	Well, other than Ragnarok, but I bought Famitsu and the Blue Dragon manga.
256760	263640	And we were supposed to hook up the Dreamcast.
263640	267320	We had talked about hooking up the Dreamcast so that I could play a couple of things that
267320	272240	I've been sort of having an itch to, but instead I downloaded ZSNES today.
272240	273240	The emulator.
273240	274240	Nice.
274240	278240	Because I want to finish Seiken Densetsu 3, and I think I know where my save file is.
278240	280960	It was at the Super Nintendo ROM you were most itching to finish?
280960	283560	Yeah, it was a pretty good RPG.
283560	286720	Those are good times.
286720	292320	If you want to join our chat room and give comments on gaming weeks, chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com,
292320	295760	and for some reason people are commenting on Joe's Crab Shack.
295760	300720	SSJ100Matt says, you ate at the Crab Shack on Passover?
300720	302840	Fired.
302840	308640	Somebody who didn't change their name, OLArmyRecruit2559 says, always with the ragnacrack.
308640	310780	Yeah, and your point is?
310780	312240	Did you ever sign up for the number two?
312240	313800	Solid Goomba, by the way.
313800	314800	Oh, okay.
314800	315880	Did you ever sign up for the number two?
315880	321080	No, I'm going to wait until they have more than just menus translated.
321080	324720	Did you get some of the bugs worked out from the early releases?
324720	329440	Yeah, because I'd actually like to be able to do the quests, and I don't read Korean.
329440	330440	Yet.
330440	339640	Amazingly enough, know how Korean is read, you know, how the characters are arranged,
339640	342120	but I do not actually read any Korean.
342120	343120	Sorry.
343120	344120	It's alright.
344120	345120	Nobody's perfect.
345120	346800	Alright, let's move on over to Loki.
346800	348520	Was there any Korean in your gaming week?
348520	349520	No.
349520	350520	Oh, then what was there?
350520	352040	I don't think.
352040	355680	I played Omega 5, actually.
355680	358560	I was downloading some Xbox Live Arcade games.
358560	361840	I downloaded Ikaruga, but I never got the chance to play it.
361840	369880	I did play, actually I played the demo of, what was it, I don't remember.
369880	370880	Anyways.
370880	374240	What was the new release this week, because I was out?
374240	376680	Rocky and Bullwinkle, and Battlezone.
376680	378320	Oh, that's right, the minigame thing.
378320	380200	I wanted to check that out.
380200	381200	I gotta catch up.
381200	384240	I heard that it sucked, but whatever.
384240	387880	I'm actually kind of excited there's another game out there that uses the webcam, other
387880	389080	than Totem Ball.
389080	391120	Totem Ball and Wouno.
391120	392120	And the other board game assortment.
392120	394120	Really, we shouldn't be encouraging them.
394120	395120	Alright, fine.
395120	396120	Whatever.
396120	398600	So, yeah, I played Omega 5, and that was pretty cool.
398600	402280	It's just really hard, but that's kind of shooters for you, I guess.
402280	409000	I played lots of Mario Kart, and it's kind of, I don't know.
409000	411080	I guess it's just like the other Mario Karts.
411080	416640	I still really hate the fact that you can't do, you know, just four person, you know,
416640	420280	everybody against everybody, you know, types of battles.
420280	423260	It always has to be two on two teams, or one on three.
423260	425120	It's just, it's stupid.
425120	427520	It's just lazy that they don't have that in there.
427520	430200	But racing is pretty fun, so we've been doing that.
430200	433960	And then, more Saints Row, yes.
433960	437440	I played multiplayer, but then I realized something.
437440	442140	I don't know why I haven't realized it before, but I just found a code in the game that actually
442140	447320	makes this game totally different, and a lot fun in just the weirdest way.
447320	451200	I couldn't stop giggling, like, the entire time I was playing this.
451200	456160	The code is the Evil Cars code, and it makes all the cars in the game try to hunt you down
456160	457160	and kill you.
457160	458160	Nice.
458160	463520	And so, you'll be running around or something, all of a sudden, this car comes from nowhere,
463520	468280	just flying through the air, just at your head, where they'll, like, be backing up towards
468280	469280	you.
469280	473440	And so, I made it, like, kind of a goal to, like, run from one end of the map to the next,
473440	474440	and it's fun.
474440	478760	And, in fact, I think I might actually do a little video for YouTube or something like
478760	481720	that, just something funny with, you know, that whole thing in there, because it's hilarious,
481720	484240	because you'll be hiding in, like, a little ditch or something, all of a sudden, all these
484240	487040	cars fly over your head and stuff, trying to kill you.
487040	489160	What's that, the plot of some movie?
489160	490160	I don't know.
490160	491160	Carrie?
491160	492160	I don't know.
492160	493160	Oh, no, not Carrie.
493160	494160	No, you're thinking...
494160	495160	That's, like, death proof.
495160	496160	No, not death proof.
496160	497160	I didn't see death proof.
497160	498160	I know what you're thinking of.
498160	499160	Ah, forget it.
499160	500160	The title of the movie.
500160	501160	But it sounds like fun.
501160	502160	Can you do that in multiplayer?
502160	503160	No.
503160	504160	Well, it would be...
504160	505160	It's people driving the cars.
505160	506160	They'll come after you.
506160	508600	If you take the people out of the cars, then they will stop moving.
508600	510720	It's not like the cars drive themselves, because that would be cool, too.
510720	513840	As I was going to say, it would be fun, like, that could be a fun multiplayer game, is,
513840	517200	like, who can live longer being chased, stalked by the cars?
517200	520960	So, what I've been doing, yeah, like I said, I put in, you know, the infinite ammo code,
520960	527520	the infinite sprint, and just go crazy, just run, you know, and it's pretty hard.
527520	528520	There's a lot of...
528520	531800	Especially when, like, you get onto the freeway and stuff, and there's trucks coming after
531800	536680	you, and cars are exploding because they keep running into each other.
536680	537680	I don't know.
537680	538680	It's pretty cool.
538680	541920	SSJ 100 Matt and Chad is chiming in with Death Race 3000, which he wants to point out is
541920	543160	being remade.
543160	544960	Is that the one where you get stalked by cars?
544960	545960	Death Race?
545960	546960	Uh, no.
546960	547960	That's the one that's just, like, Carmageddon.
547960	550480	No, I know the one you're thinking about.
550480	551640	It's a Stephen King movie.
551640	552640	It was Carrie!
552640	553640	It wasn't Carrie.
553640	554640	No, Carrie was the prom king.
554640	555640	Christine.
555640	557640	Christine was the prom queen.
557640	560680	Christine was the one about the Plymouth Fury.
560680	561680	Yes.
561680	565360	Well, there's another one I was thinking of where the cars were alive, and remember they
565360	568120	had that big rig with the clown face on the front?
568120	569120	It?
569120	570120	No, that wasn't it.
570120	571120	Forget it.
571120	572120	Forget it.
572120	573120	I don't remember what it's called.
573120	576120	I'm not sure if someone in chat will know, though, but yeah, it's cool, though.
576120	580040	The code just, you know, I guess a little bit more life for this next few weeks until
580040	581160	Grand Theft Auto IV comes out.
581160	583720	And you've been extending the life of Saints Row for quite some time.
583720	584720	Oh, it's a great game.
584720	587280	You're one of the only people I know that still just doesn't shut up about this game
587280	588280	ever.
588280	589280	It's a great game.
589280	592720	I already have my Saints Row 2 preordered, so I can't wait to play that, too.
592720	597400	And, you know, and I don't, everyone's always, you know, pro Saints Row or pro Grand Theft
597400	599080	Auto and, you know, hating on the other ones.
599080	600440	I don't understand why you can't like both.
600440	604080	I love both games just equally, and they're good in different ways.
604080	609280	I mean, Grand Theft Auto tends to be more realistic, where Saints Row is just absolutely
609280	614000	batshit crazy with, you know, all sorts of, like, stuff that you wouldn't be able to do
614000	615000	in real life.
615000	616000	It's just great.
616000	617000	All right.
617000	619640	Chad.orangelsrader.com, some comments.
619640	624560	In response to the vision cam, vxjsonXV says Rayman's raving rabbits on the 360 use the
624560	625560	vision cam.
625560	626640	Unless, of course, you're talking about arcade scheduling.
626640	632520	And Brad from Pod Culture, Maximo Overdrive was the name of the movie with the cars there.
632520	633520	Nice work.
633520	634520	Nice work.
634520	639760	I was going to say about Rayman's Raving Rabbids, I was already worn out from the Wii version.
639760	642440	I never even bothered with the 360 version, because I was already kind of...
642440	645320	It's dirt cheap now, because that game didn't sell for crap, so...
645320	646320	I bet.
646320	647320	Well, aren't they making a sequel, though?
647320	649920	They already made a sequel, Rayman's Raving Rabbids 2.
649920	652640	They came out on the Wii last year, around the holiday.
652640	653760	Apparently, I slept through it.
653760	654760	Oh, well, you didn't miss much.
654760	655760	That's what I hear.
655760	660320	But they didn't do one for the 360, because, you know, the 360 one didn't sell at all.
660320	662720	Frisbee wants to know, can you use the vision cam on the computer?
662720	664400	Yes, you can, actually.
664400	667960	There's software available on Microsoft's website, but there's no audio with it, and
667960	669800	the quality's not great.
669800	670800	We actually...
670800	675320	I actually considered using it for our Justin TV feed, which is taping our show over Justin
675320	679800	TV, but the quality's not that great.
679800	681720	So that's why we don't use it.
681720	682720	But it does work.
682720	684460	It is a USB camera.
684460	687600	My gaming week, believe it or not, even though I was out of town for four days, I did get
687600	692520	the opportunity to play something new, because what is going into the wilderness with 10-year
692520	696360	friends staying in a cabin and not bringing along some party video game?
696360	700680	And I got to check out, for the first time, SingStar on the PlayStation 2.
700680	703400	And we've talked about this game an awful lot on the show, but I've always been more
703400	704760	of a karaoke revolution player.
704760	705880	That's the games I've had.
705880	710160	But we did get to check out SingStar, and the friend of ours had a variety.
710160	713800	He had SingStar 80s, SingStar Pop, and SingStar Amped.
713800	716520	And I guess one kind of cool thing is that you could switch back and forth between the
716520	719920	games without having to turn the whole dang thing off and on.
719920	723520	You just pop in another disc, and it loads the 30 songs from that disc.
723520	725400	Each game has about 30 songs.
725400	726400	SingStar was kind of fun.
726400	728840	I was more impressed with it than I thought I would be.
728840	732320	The only kind of bitches I have is that I didn't like the pitch gauging quite as much
732320	734160	as I do in Karaoke Revolution.
734160	736760	You can only see your pitch as you sing.
736760	741600	You don't see it any time you're saying something in the mic like you do in Karaoke Revolution.
741600	743960	You really kind of have to play both games to know what I'm talking about.
743960	747320	But if you play Karaoke Revolution, any time you make a sound, that arrow shows up on the
747320	749000	line to show you where you're at.
749000	752880	Whereas in SingStar, you don't see it until you're already singing.
752880	757040	But one thing I did like about SingStar is that it had pretty much all the real music
757040	760520	videos in the background as you're playing, which is kind of cool.
760520	762120	SingStar Pop has Aha!
762120	763120	Take On Me.
763120	766720	So you know we had to play that just to see the video, because, I mean, how long?
766720	768720	When was the last time you saw Aha!
768720	769720	Take On Me, the video?
769720	771600	I mean, it's got to be like years and years ago.
771600	773720	Some of our listeners are probably too young to even remember this video.
773720	774720	Oh, Rob.
774720	775720	What?
775720	776720	About four days ago.
776720	777720	On YouTube or something?
777720	778720	Yeah.
778720	780360	I hadn't seen it in years.
780360	781360	I hadn't seen it in years.
781360	782360	It's the one-hit-lender song.
782360	783360	I know, but still.
783360	788680	NessusJ100Matt says, Rob, in a cabin in the woods with SingStar, horror movie plotline
788680	789680	anyone?
789680	790680	Kind of.
790680	791840	It could have been.
791840	797360	But there was a lot of songs I sang and had a pretty recognizable song list.
797360	802400	I actually think I might want to pick this game up on PlayStation 3, although, only it's
802400	803400	a party game.
803400	807480	I mean, you know how there's those video games that really only work when you have friends
807480	808480	over?
808480	809480	SingStar's definitely one of those games.
809480	810480	Let's wait for the WiiWare one.
810480	811480	I think.
811480	812480	Yeah, maybe.
812480	813480	Because why get a PlayStation 3 for the crappy game?
813480	816720	Well, I'm not going to get it just for that, but I like the fact that there's the music
816720	820280	videos, the actual music videos in the background, and the way it's put together is nice.
820280	823680	You know you just want it so you can film yourself and put yourself on that fake YouTube
823680	824680	thing.
824680	825680	Hell no.
825680	826680	Hell no.
826680	827680	I'm not going to be able to exploit it.
827680	830320	I'm not going to subject myself to that.
830320	832520	Can you imagine me getting on there singing Like a Prayer?
832520	835160	You know what happened last time I sang Like a Prayer or Karaoke?
835160	839880	Yeah, it's been like 10 years and I haven't lived it down, so not going to happen, sorry.
839880	841960	Or if it is, it's set to private or something.
841960	842960	We'll see.
842960	843960	So.
843960	844960	Alright.
844960	848840	And that, and I played on the PSP, because William brought his PSP, he was playing the
848840	851880	shit out of Puzzle Quest most of the time, I played more Final Fantasy while I was sick
851880	855720	yesterday because I got food poisoning or something, I was sick all day yesterday.
855720	856720	One.
856720	860280	But it's the old school upgraded one on PSP, and I know I've talked about it on the show
860280	864320	before a while back, but man, the graphics are just beautiful on the PSP.
864320	867480	That's one thing the PSP does have going for it, is even though it has that little screen
867480	870800	and everything, you know, the graphics are high def and gorgeous.
870800	873680	That's one thing I really like about the PSP.
873680	877460	So I kind of want to go and pick out, get Final Fantasy II so I can play that on my
877460	880560	PSP and then if I want to borrow a Final Fantasy I will.
880560	884240	I didn't get into the II, it was, I don't know.
884240	885240	It's just different.
885240	886240	Yeah.
886240	887240	It's just different.
887240	892920	Alright, well that's going to do it for our gaming week, so if you want to join in and
892920	898720	chime in on our gaming weeks or the news for tonight, you can join our chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
898720	904040	In the meantime, we do have some housekeeping for you guys.
904040	911280	One thing that kind of made me sad, you know we have the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki at orangelaungeradio.wiki.com,
911280	915160	and that is growing and growing and the people, the listeners that have been contributing
915160	917600	to that are doing an awesome job, it's great.
917600	919240	The bad news isn't about that.
919240	924880	The bad news is about Wikipedia, the main site, you know, wikipedia.org.
924880	927080	You know how Orange Lounge Radio had an article on there?
927080	928080	It got zapped.
928080	929080	Somebody deleted it.
929080	930080	That's ridiculous.
930080	933000	But here's the thing, here's the thing I don't get.
933000	937000	I always thought that articles when they got deleted from Wikipedia had to go through a
937000	941040	review phase for like articles pended for deletion or whatever and people are supposed
941040	942040	to review it.
942040	946240	So, when I looked at the deletion log, this guy named ClockworkSoul just nuked it.
946240	947560	He must be some admin on there.
947560	953560	He just nuked it and it said, web content does not indicate important significance.
953560	955120	Sad.
955120	958120	Without any debate or argument, this guy just kind of did it.
958120	960520	Well, now you know who to go after.
960520	964440	Well, I mean, I think we all kind of knew it was coming anyway, but I mean, I don't
964440	965440	know, you know, we were...
965440	967440	A warning would have been nice.
967440	970920	I don't know, you know, we were one of the, we've been one of the longest running, you
970920	974080	know, when we had the Live Through Six Five station, we were one of the longest running
974080	978760	video game shows on the internet and, you know, now we're teamed up to probably form
978760	983600	one of the, with all games, probably the most experienced out there on the internet.
983600	987360	We were one of the first shows to use Skype, probably the first show to use Skype.
987360	990280	I actually, there's a part of me that thinks we were the first only show to use Skype and
990280	992760	I think I have the post to back that up.
992760	996380	Not to toot our horn too much, but I think there are things we have accomplished that
996380	998240	make it somewhat notable.
998240	1005560	Well, what about the other websites referred to on there that are still, you know, there?
1005560	1006560	No.
1006560	1011680	First site to use a PSP-based website, first gaming thing to have a PSP spin-off site,
1011680	1012680	whatever.
1012680	1014680	So let's just put it back up.
1014680	1017280	Yeah, well, first and least updated.
1017280	1022520	Yeah, but I would just say if you guys are going to go back and recreate it, you just
1022520	1025640	might want to source some things, but you know, some of our news stories are on YouTube,
1025640	1028080	whatever, but oh well, we'll see what happens.
1028080	1032360	Regardless, we do have the OrangeLoungeRadio Wiki, which is like 10 times better anyway,
1032360	1038520	and nobody can delete that, so whatever, whatever, see if we care.
1038520	1042560	Our communities, we have Myspace.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, we have our Facebook community,
1042560	1047920	the OL Army, our live journal community, OrangeLounge, join us if you are on any of those communities.
1047920	1052660	Speaking of community, the All Games community has banded together for this.
1052660	1054600	This is awesome.
1054600	1060560	A limited edition Xbox 360 Elite based on Grand Theft Auto 4 is being given away.
1060560	1062640	Now we have to correct something that was said last week's show.
1062640	1065080	It is not one of the 500.
1065080	1066080	That's the bad news.
1066080	1070280	It is not one of the 500 Uber limited edition things that Mark Echo got one of when we were
1070280	1071440	making fun of him.
1071440	1077640	Where the other 499 went, we have no idea, but the good news is it's one of eight.
1077640	1083800	This is one of eight Xboxes being prepared with the whole customization specifically for
1083800	1086560	community websites as a Grand Theft Auto promotion.
1086560	1090800	All Games dot com has one, and OrangeLoungeRadio is coming together with a bunch of All Game
1090800	1095240	shows, including All Games Interactive, Dead Pixel Live, Bobby Black Wolf Show, Super Happy
1095240	1100120	Fun Time Show, Electric Sisterhood, Media Spective, Chatterbox Video Game Radio, Video
1100120	1103660	Game Outsiders, Ultimate Quest, Video Game Show, and Platformation, all coming together
1103660	1107320	to give away this Xbox 360 Elite.
1107320	1111280	If you want to win this, you can, because here's how it's going to work.
1111280	1115680	Each one of those affiliates I just named is going to send one finalist to the final
1115680	1117540	round, and here's how it works.
1117540	1120280	Every show is doing the same giveaway.
1120280	1123560	What's going to happen is that, okay, you know how Grand Theft Auto, one of the big
1123560	1128400	things in it is the radio stations that play, you know, Grand Theft Auto, huge on the soundtracks,
1128400	1129400	right?
1129400	1133040	You know, the last one had what, like a four-disc soundtrack, and they play all these songs.
1133040	1139180	Well, amidst the songs are fake DJs, and people tell me all the time I sound like that one
1139180	1141400	DJ in Grand Theft Auto, what the hell is his name?
1141400	1142400	Laszlo.
1142400	1143400	Yeah, Laszlo, okay.
1143400	1144520	Apparently, I sound like him.
1144520	1145720	I don't know if that's true or not.
1145720	1147880	I don't hear it, but I guess other people do.
1147880	1151480	So, you know how Grand Theft Auto has those DJs and stuff, they have little commercials
1151480	1153380	and fake DJ things.
1153380	1155960	We want you to be that, okay?
1155960	1156960	Here's how it works.
1156960	1160920	You are going to submit a sound clip, it can't be any longer than two minutes, and it has
1160920	1165600	to be in the style of a Grand Theft Auto 4 radio station commercial, okay?
1165600	1170600	It can be a spoof ad, a segment, it can be a little song and dance, whatever.
1170600	1175040	It has to somehow relate to Orange Lounge Radio, okay?
1175040	1176120	That's the only thing.
1176120	1179600	It can be one of our in-jokes, and if you don't know any in-jokes, go check the wiki.
1179600	1183080	It can just say our name in it somewhere, whatever.
1183080	1186880	It just has to somehow relate to Orange Lounge Radio.
1186880	1190560	We will pick our favorites, like maybe our top five favorites.
1190560	1195760	The community will vote on the winner, which will then go on to the final round at AllGames.com
1195760	1198840	to win one of these eight rare 360s.
1198840	1199840	That's like, what?
1199840	1205640	Two minutes worth of voiceover for possibly an Xbox 360 Elite, one of eight being made
1205640	1207440	in the world.
1207440	1208440	So there you have it.
1208440	1213980	So the contest starts tonight, and if you have an MP3 you would like to submit to us,
1213980	1214980	you can send that on in.
1214980	1220180	You can either send it to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, or we will set up a special page on our forums
1220180	1221180	where you can send those in.
1221180	1222180	We'll pick our favorites.
1222180	1225640	The community will then vote on the winner, and then what happens is that the winning
1225640	1231080	bumper goes to All Games Radio, and All Games Radio will choose the ultimate winner out
1231080	1232080	of those.
1232080	1236400	But hey, the good news is, just for winning from us, you get an All Games t-shirt and
1236400	1239400	a $25 gift certificate to Shop.AllGames.com.
1239400	1244040	They sell video games, so that's like half off a video game right there, so go for it.
1244040	1245040	Submission starts tonight.
1245040	1251720	You have to have these in by May 4th at midnight Pacific time, no late entries accepted.
1251720	1255360	I know many of you listen to several shows on AllGames.com.
1255360	1259400	You can submit multiple entries per multiple shows, but keep in mind you'll probably have
1259400	1263560	to do different bumpers because, you know, since we're making you have something related
1263560	1268020	to Orange Launch Radio, for example, Electric Sistahood would probably want something relating
1268020	1271580	to their show, and so on and so on.
1271580	1275080	We have the right to play your submission on our show, blah, blah, blah.
1275080	1279080	If one person should win multiple contests, a coin flip determines the winner.
1279080	1281280	Open to North American residents only.
1281280	1282280	I'm sorry.
1282280	1283660	US and Canada only.
1283660	1286540	It's an NTSC console, so we can't give it to Europe.
1286540	1287540	Those are the rules.
1287540	1288540	Sorry, Europe.
1288540	1291640	Yeah, and we can't really give it to anybody else because it's going to me.
1291640	1295520	Unfortunately, cast and crew of the participating affiliate shows are not eligible.
1295520	1298020	Sorry, Loki.
1298020	1301720	And last but not least, no copywritten materials permitted in the entry.
1301720	1303000	Parody is fine.
1303000	1306240	You can't use, like, if you want to play Welcome to the Jungle, you have to, like, sing it
1306240	1309400	yourself or something, or, you know, welcome to the radio or something.
1309400	1310400	I don't know.
1310400	1311880	You have to sing a makeup thing.
1311880	1313680	So there you have it.
1313680	1315800	ActDeft is asking, what about Mexico?
1315800	1318280	I will have to ask the official judges about that.
1318280	1320280	I think that counts as North America.
1320280	1324640	I think that's okay, but I will get the final ruling on that shortly.
1324640	1327360	Decisions of the judges are final, no bitching.
1327360	1331700	If you like the full list of rules, they are available on forums.allgames.com, and we'll
1331700	1333400	be posting them on our site soon.
1333400	1336600	So that's, like, what, like the $500 prize right there?
1336600	1337920	It's nice stuff.
1337920	1341140	There's prizes for second and third place, too, but if I told you that tonight, I'd have
1341140	1343840	nothing to tell you about next week when we plug the contest again.
1343840	1344840	So get working on it.
1344840	1350480	A two-minute commercial parody Orange Laundry, anything that would happen in one of those
1350480	1352720	little radio bits in the Grand Theft Auto game.
1352720	1353720	Be creative.
1353720	1357920	If you want, if you don't have a fancy recording studio set up in your place, you can also
1357920	1362600	leave it on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, when we're not live.
1362600	1364480	You can call in and leave a bumper there.
1364480	1366560	So don't say you don't have many different ways to send this in.
1366560	1371360	It's all for you, Tali, anyways, because, like I said, and say it again, the console's
1371360	1372360	going to me.
1372360	1373360	Sorry.
1373360	1374360	Even though you're ineligible.
1374360	1375360	Even though I'm ineligible.
1375360	1376800	Hell, I'm not even entering, and it's going to me.
1376800	1379760	So that's just the way the cookie crumbles.
1379760	1380760	Good luck with that, Logie.
1380760	1382600	All right, let's get to some gaming news.
1382600	1390840	All right, so anyways, this week we're going to start things out with a story that's not
1390840	1394960	too surprising, since there was Marvel versus Capcom.
1394960	1401560	Sure, let's do Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe, and of course they had a little teaser video.
1401560	1407600	Actually, first there was an image that leaked out showing Sub-Zero staring down Batman,
1407600	1414380	and then they actually fully veiled it for Midway's Gamer Day, and they were showing
1414380	1418960	off a trailer featuring Sub-Zero fighting Batman.
1418960	1425560	And the game itself, it looks, okay, I don't know, not a huge Mortal Kombat fan, but flying
1425560	1430640	through the air while punching each other, falling, it's kind of hokey, but that's just
1430640	1432280	my opinion, you know, whatever.
1432280	1436160	It made me think of the more recent Dead or Alive games.
1436160	1441400	All I gotta say is, I hope they have villains in there as well, other than just, because
1441400	1445360	I think it'd be pretty badass if they had a cool version of Joker in there, okay, that
1445360	1446360	might be pretty cool.
1446360	1449640	It might also be in horrible taste, though, to play a fatality on the Joker.
1449640	1455520	Okay, shut up, okay, fucking Jack Nicklaus is still alive, who cares if, you know, Jack
1455520	1457560	Nicklaus was a golf player, you mean Jack Nicholson?
1457560	1458560	Nicholson, whatever.
1458560	1462600	Hey, you, little did you know, Jack Nicklaus was actually Joker at one time, and then Jack
1462600	1468920	Nicklaus was, it's just, all these things you don't know about movies, there, Rob.
1468920	1472520	Look, I said this on Bobby's show when we were doing our little tease before we went
1472520	1476760	live tonight, the thing is, is that obviously this game's not going to have fatalities because
1476760	1480160	it's going for a teen rating or whatever, right, but, you know, and people are like,
1480160	1483800	oh my god, I can't believe it, what's a Mortal Kombat game without fatalities, but like,
1483800	1487960	you know, it's kind of sacrilegious to be able to perform a fatality on Wonder Woman,
1487960	1492080	come on, or on Batman, I mean, you can't decapitate Batman, you just can't.
1492080	1494080	You can break Batman's back.
1494080	1497080	You can do a friendship on Batman all you want, in fact, that might be kind of funny.
1497080	1498080	You can break his back.
1498080	1500080	That would be hilarious, because that's what happened to him.
1500080	1503080	I think this should be mature, I mean, come on, stop twistying out, DC, seriously.
1503080	1506280	You could, somebody said in chat earlier, you could kill Superman, but he'd just come
1506280	1507280	back.
1507280	1508280	Yeah.
1508280	1514560	Because, I don't know, it's just sacrilegious, I don't know, don't ask me why, it's just
1514560	1518000	something about seeing your childhood hero get decapitated is all kinds of wrong.
1518000	1519520	Now, here's a question for you, Rob.
1519520	1520520	But friendships are okay.
1520520	1527160	Can you think of any game whatsoever that's had Superman in it that's been any good?
1527160	1530440	Superman on the Atari 2600 when I was five years old was the shit.
1530440	1532240	Okay, well, that doesn't count.
1532240	1533240	Why not?
1533240	1535160	You said name a Superman video game that was good.
1535160	1538160	Okay, I was thinking, I don't know, within this decade.
1538160	1540120	There was that Justice League game that was the...
1540120	1541120	That wasn't very good.
1541120	1544400	It was better than the straight Superman games.
1544400	1548040	All the Superman, all the games that Superman has ever touched, crap.
1548040	1552280	So I'm sorry, this isn't going to be very good, and it's Superman's fault.
1552280	1554880	He should have stayed dead like a good superhero.
1554880	1559840	Instead of a fatality, I'm thinking the game will have nudalities where the characters
1559840	1565640	are forced to don their own underoos.
1565640	1567120	I guess that wouldn't get a teen rating, though, would it?
1567120	1569040	I hope the Wonder Twins are in it.
1569040	1570040	Well...
1570040	1571040	Because they're great.
1571040	1576080	All I can say is this is going to come out and be yet another mediocre Mortal Kombat
1576080	1577080	game.
1577080	1578080	I...
1578080	1582800	Am I the only one that actually enjoys Mortal Kombat's combat system, and I like the game...
1582800	1586360	Like, I kind of liked how you could switch between the fighting styles and the weapons.
1586360	1587360	If it's in the...
1587360	1589960	I actually kind of enjoy the Mortal Kombat games, not just for the fatalities.
1589960	1595960	If I'm to be fair, though, I don't like Street Fighter either, so, you know.
1595960	1600920	I like the fact that, okay, personally I like the fact that everything was hand-drawn stuff
1600920	1601920	in Marvel vs. Capcom.
1601920	1606640	Hell, if they wanted to do a 2D fighter with the Mortal Kombat characters, all hand-drawn,
1606640	1610720	in, you know, not really Mortal Kombat style, but kind of ripping off, I don't know, SNK
1610720	1613360	or, you know, Capcom, that would be pretty badass.
1613360	1615640	You know, do it, do it, like, DC comic style.
1615640	1616640	That'd be pretty cool.
1616640	1621520	See, I think that they should do a Marvel vs. DC fighter, so that all the Marvel characters
1621520	1623240	would just beat up everybody in the DC universe.
1623240	1627160	Yeah, but how much money would that cost to get both those licenses to play together nicely?
1627160	1631640	But, as I said earlier, they've done it before.
1631640	1636880	There's been, they've worked together before for plenty of comics, you know.
1636880	1638880	Alright, let's read comments from chat room.
1638880	1642800	SSJ100Matt wants to point out, there was a good Superman arcade game.
1642800	1648360	Rama says, mind you, Mortal Kombat vs. DC idea has been around since Marvel vs. Capcom,
1648360	1650840	which is funny because I know it's been brought up on this show before.
1650840	1654760	I want to say this whole thing was in rumors state a couple months ago, and we joked about
1654760	1656000	it then.
1656000	1659640	Rama continues, and as much as I'm not too thrilled about not having fatalities, Mortal
1659640	1661720	Kombat vs. DC does not need it.
1661720	1665420	Yes, the fandom will be pissed off, but the DC fandom is bigger than the Mortal Kombat
1665420	1667840	fandom, and you want to keep the natives happy.
1667840	1668920	Here's what's going to happen.
1668920	1671840	This game is going to be, okay, this is in development right now.
1671840	1673300	It's scheduled out for the fall.
1673300	1674680	What movie's coming out this summer?
1674680	1676560	You know, The Dark Knight.
1676560	1679400	What movie's going to probably be out on DVD in the fall?
1679400	1680800	Here's where the whoring begins.
1680800	1684480	They're just going to put this out at the same time as the fucking Dark Knight movie,
1684480	1687320	and they're just going to try to sell some more copies on a mediocre game.
1687320	1690960	Pardon my ignorance, I don't follow comic books, but is Iron Man DC or Marvel?
1690960	1691960	Marvel.
1691960	1692960	Oh, never mind.
1692960	1693960	That's not related.
1693960	1696080	Because I was going to say there's the Iron Man movie coming out too, but I guess that's
1696080	1697080	a whole...
1697080	1698080	That's Marvel.
1698080	1699080	That's Marvel whoring.
1699080	1700080	Ah, that's why I asked.
1700080	1701080	And I'm getting the Iron Man game too.
1701080	1707760	Actually, that's Sega whoring Marvel characters, like that and the Incredible Hulk, both games
1707760	1711560	which look good, but I think are going to be mediocre.
1711560	1715880	You know, I think the last comic book I bought when I was maybe seven years old was Uncle
1715880	1718440	Scrooge and Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
1718440	1719880	I have comics right here.
1719880	1721520	And you know what?
1721520	1722520	What?
1722520	1723520	Best comic book game ever.
1723520	1724520	See?
1724520	1726520	DuckTales was a pretty awesome comic book game.
1726520	1727520	Comic book.
1727520	1728520	Comics.
1728520	1729520	Nice.
1729520	1730520	X-Men.
1730520	1731520	Is that what a comic looks like?
1731520	1732520	It's a graphic novel.
1732520	1733520	Nice.
1733520	1734520	It's the older one too.
1734520	1735520	That's what adults have to read nowadays, because you can't read comics.
1735520	1737080	You have to read graphic novels.
1737080	1740360	Hell no, I still buy comics.
1740360	1741440	I got to ask this.
1741440	1746320	Instapoll in chat, there is a greater comic book game than DuckTales.
1746320	1755560	Y or N. Meanwhile, we'll see what the Instapoll results are in a minute.
1755560	1757180	By the way, Tigerclaw wants to add this.
1757180	1760640	I don't think this is in our show role anywhere, but speaking of Mortal Kombat, I don't know
1760640	1766000	if you heard this, the actor who was Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat movie, Robin Shu, he
1766000	1770520	is going to be Jen in the new Street Fighter movie.
1770520	1774560	So there's that crossover there for Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter that one of the
1774560	1775560	actors is going to be.
1775560	1776960	That's very loose, Rob.
1776960	1777960	I know.
1777960	1779560	A little bit.
1779560	1785520	And little does he realize what kind of crap he is walking into.
1785520	1790880	Do we not forget Raul Julia and what happened to him in the last Street Fighter movie?
1790880	1792920	He died after it was made, if I remember right.
1792920	1793920	Yeah, okay.
1793920	1794920	Yeah.
1794920	1798320	Do you really want to admit yourself to something that is associated with death?
1798320	1799320	I don't know.
1799320	1800320	All right.
1800320	1804200	Let's talk about something associated with eternal life, such as Soul Calibur, because
1804200	1806520	thinking about this game makes me warm and fuzzy.
1806520	1809900	And wasn't there like eternal life, soul lives on forever, whatever.
1809900	1810900	The soul still burns?
1810900	1813880	Well, the soul keeps burning on July 29th.
1813880	1817360	Soul Calibur is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
1817360	1818800	I'm sorry, not on that day.
1818800	1820000	Something else will come out that day.
1820000	1824840	On Xbox Live Arcade though, sometime this summer, Soul Calibur is going to be coming
1824840	1825840	out.
1825840	1831000	It's going to be old school, because it's the Dreamcast version that's actually coming
1831000	1834320	to Xbox Live Arcade, not the arcade version of Soul Calibur.
1834320	1836960	It better have the Japanese voices in it.
1836960	1837960	That would be kind of cool.
1837960	1839960	Because my man was maxi.
1839960	1844600	It will have arcade training and survival modes in it.
1844600	1847360	And that was revealed at Namco's Gamers' Day.
1847360	1848920	It is not the arcade version.
1848920	1851560	It is the Dreamcast version.
1851560	1858800	Now the question is, will it have to squeeze into that 150 megabyte limit or not?
1858800	1860640	So that's going to be pretty rad.
1860640	1863640	Especially if they're up the graphics to HD and all that other good stuff they usually
1863640	1864640	do.
1864640	1865640	That's going to be pretty rad, don't you think, Jamie?
1865640	1867640	I think that would be fairly pretty.
1867640	1874160	Soul Calibur is also, remember, they gave us rod caliber.
1874160	1875160	That's the next question.
1875160	1879000	Will we be able to use other interesting control devices on the Xbox 360?
1879000	1882120	There isn't a fishing rod controller for that.
1882120	1884560	No, but there's the scenic controller.
1884560	1885560	That would be cool.
1885560	1887560	We should have a contest.
1887560	1894760	There's also the rock band drums, guitar caliber.
1894760	1896680	We want guitar caliber, okay.
1896680	1903800	Dude, I played Soul Calibur with my DDR pads because my first DDR I owned was the Dreamcast
1903800	1904960	DDR.
1904960	1910960	And the only analog button on there was the Konami logo to put it into SSR.
1910960	1914680	And the question being asked in our chat room by none other than Bobby Black Wolf.
1914680	1916800	In other words, will it blend?
1916800	1918840	That's a very good question.
1918840	1919840	Will it blend?
1919840	1920840	Awesome.
1920840	1924260	Here's the results of our quick poll and then we'll get to more Soul Calibur news courtesy
1924260	1925960	of Jamie.
1925960	1928920	Quick poll was, is there a comic book game better than DuckTales?
1928920	1930920	Here are the results.
1930920	1937760	N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, Y, X-Men Mutant Apocalypse.
1937760	1940920	It's all about maximum carnage, I missed that one.
1940920	1948560	Y, Superman 64, X-Men Arcade is a close second, N, Y, Marvel Superheroes versus Street Fighters,
1948560	1953600	N, N, DuckTales freaking rocked, Y, X-Men Arcade.
1953600	1957000	The X-Men Arcade game was really, really good.
1957000	1960360	Looks like majority do believe DuckTales is the greatest comic book game ever made though.
1960360	1961360	That's kind of surprising.
1961360	1968160	But I can't count DuckTales as a comic book game because the show was out, there wasn't
1968160	1972740	a DuckTales comic book until I think what, six months after the show had already been
1972740	1974120	out for a while.
1974120	1978660	So technically it was based off of, so that question's actually invalid.
1978660	1980520	So our entire poll was a crock of shit.
1980520	1987560	The entire poll wasn't just a crock of shit, it was a crock of compost.
1987560	1990000	Well then why don't you take us back to reality Ms. Summers.
1990000	1996480	Okay but I prefer unreality so how about more Soul Calibur news.
1996480	2003720	Soul Calibur 4, you know what, I have hopes for this just because I didn't play the last
2003720	2007080	one because it was, anyway.
2007080	2012440	So Soul Calibur 4 is going to be out on July 29th and there will be a regular and a premium
2012440	2013440	edition.
2013440	2018400	What you talk about Jamie, Soul Calibur 3 was awesome.
2018400	2023560	Here you could make, was it the Pope or was it the Pope character they made or was that
2023560	2025240	in the moral combat?
2025240	2029360	The Pope was in Soul Calibur 3.
2029360	2032320	The pantsless Pope.
2032320	2036600	I had a lot of friends actually make custom characters for that.
2036600	2042000	That was the only thing I wanted and I don't know if this one's going to have any customize.
2042000	2046560	The special edition I think was going to have some sort of thing for that.
2046560	2050320	Well anyway you're going to get your choices of different characters like Darth Vader and
2050320	2057520	Yoda and a bunch of other people and no spawn.
2057520	2060800	That's okay though.
2060800	2066200	But it's of course different versions are going to have different characters like PlayStation
2066200	2073680	3 will have Darth Vader, Xbox 360 will have Yoda, but there are, but like you were saying
2073680	2079240	the premium edition is going to have the extra customization content and a tournament kit
2079240	2082760	and that will retail for $79.99.
2082760	2087920	Okay Quandary, I'm getting my stimulus check like we all are hopefully pretty soon right
2087920	2093120	and I'm thinking $600 perfect amount to finally take the splurge and buy my damn PlayStation
2093120	2095440	3 right because you know there's going to be all this crap around Christmas time I'm
2095440	2098360	going to want including home right.
2098360	2102680	So here's the thing is that here's where I'm stuck is that I don't know whether to get
2102680	2108000	Soul Calibur 3 for the PlayStation 3 or Xbox because I do think Vader is cooler than Yoda
2108000	2113320	so I kind of want the PlayStation 3 version based on that alone but I know on Xbox Live
2113320	2117120	the online is going to have to be better on Xbox Live.
2117120	2118480	Well yeah.
2118480	2121120	And there's going to be more people and there's achievements and so on.
2121120	2122120	So what do I do?
2122120	2125600	I know you guys are both buy in your console ownings.
2125600	2127040	What do you think?
2127040	2128560	Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3?
2128560	2132080	I'm going to put the same question to Chad as another mini quick poll.
2132080	2135160	Only for those of you guys that own both systems which one are you getting Soul Calibur 3 on
2135160	2139100	and why if you're buying it or Soul Calibur 4 what the hell Soul Calibur 4 and why?
2139100	2145680	I'm thinking that we'll probably go with the Xbox 360 edition just because Yoda is comical
2145680	2153280	fighting but again it's like you said there's going to be more content out plus I also think
2153280	2158440	that the Xbox 360 controller is just a little more comfortable for a fighting game.
2158440	2160440	That's just me.
2160440	2162800	Loki?
2162800	2165440	I would just I wouldn't buy a system for that game.
2165440	2168640	I'm not going to buy the system for the game I want the system for other stuff too but
2168640	2171080	I'm just saying you know if I'm going to have the system anyway.
2171080	2175440	I wouldn't buy the system until home comes out trust me I mean because who knows I mean
2175440	2179000	seriously this summer you know they may be trying to drive sales they may drop the price
2179000	2180000	again.
2180000	2185120	Okay okay okay let me confess I'm eyeing the whole gray metal MGS4 bundle.
2185120	2188320	Alright good luck finding that.
2188320	2195000	I would say you know just I guess I could be sort of biased towards the 360 but only
2195000	2199520	because you should really look at the game more than just one character and I know that
2199520	2204580	Darth Vader is cool and all but if you want to play Darth Vader kicking ass just buy Force
2204580	2209120	Unleashed when that comes out but I don't know.
2209120	2213560	Really how much did you well I guess Soul Calibur 2 I mean Link was pretty popular and
2213560	2214560	stuff like that.
2214560	2219040	Yeah exactly like you had to have Soul Calibur 2 on the GameCube because of Link hands down
2219040	2220880	hands down.
2220880	2224920	Anyway let's see we had all we actually have all of those all right let's let's let's look
2224920	2229140	at the chat room what they thought J-Rod says PlayStation 3 equals Vader Vader greater than
2229140	2234400	all Black Wolf says I'm getting the PlayStation 3 yes I have both because of Vader J-Rod says
2234400	2239040	the only way to get more people on PlayStation Network is to buy the PlayStation 3 J-Rod
2239040	2248040	says Soul Calibur 4 is PlayStation 3 for me let's see hit stun says you have to have Yoda
2248040	2255800	versus Vader Quel Tipo says 360 fuck Vader Semeraw1215 says the PlayStation 3 version
2255800	2262040	is better for Vader and the control is much better for Soul Calibur J-Rod answered the
2262040	2265480	question like five times it's throwing me off footy monster said if I get it I'm gonna
2265480	2271120	go 360 because that's what I own plus Yoda greater than Vader yes I said it bitches and
2271120	2275560	RawsteelUT says stop hating the PlayStation 3 Loki I don't hate the PlayStation 3 it's
2275560	2280840	just once again they've got the achievement system built in already I have more friends
2280840	2286200	that are on you know the 360 you know I'll be getting you know exclusive games for the
2286200	2291920	you know PS3 when those come out just right now if there's a game coming out on both platforms
2291920	2298080	I'm gonna get it on the 360 um let's see and sj100 Matt says Rob here's what you do rent
2298080	2302000	the 360 version and see if you even like it I know I'm gonna like it the Soul Calibur
2302000	2305520	is like one of the few like hardcore fighting games I really really like who's to say I
2305520	2310520	know I'm gonna like it Bobby said before who's to say that they could possibly you know add
2310520	2315060	these as download content later on for the other systems you never know so you know that
2315060	2320600	could be all for not and of course why would they pass up the opportunity to you know whore
2320600	2325000	out themselves a little bit and you know sell the characters for an extra five bucks on
2325000	2329360	top of the game I mean I could see them doing that especially now that we have download
2329360	2335040	content available time will tell time was I would see them not so much the Vader Yoda
2335040	2338340	thing but maybe bringing back classic Soul Calibur characters who maybe don't make the
2338340	2342980	cut for Soul Calibur 4 or always were intended to be downloadables or something this should
2342980	2348820	be a special mode we'll see or what do you want to bet if this custom creator thing is
2348820	2353260	in it that's where your download content is going to be download new pants but the special
2353260	2360860	mode should be the kill Voldo mode again and again and again oh yes again replace the punching
2360860	2366140	bag mode with just Voldo yeah all right we'll see all right let's move on new game one thing
2366140	2371580	you may be able to download content on for Soul Calibur 4 would be the brand new PlayStation
2371580	2377860	store that's right this week after a brief bit of downtime they have finally brought
2377860	2383660	back the PlayStation store with its new features and stuff it's a lot easier to browse and
2383660	2388020	then finally kind of caught up on all the content that you know 360 owners have had
2388020	2394460	for a while including still live for Rock Band and all that stuff so definitely worth
2394460	2402660	checking out also coming along with that is the brand new firmware 2.30 and that's live
2402660	2411900	as well and I don't know it's supposed to be enhancing I was a DTS HD and master high
2411900	2419660	resolution audio so oh it looks a lot better I didn't really care for the old PlayStation
2419660	2424940	store too much I still wish that the those prepaid cards are out there because that'd
2424940	2428820	be pretty nice I could buy some a store credit instead of having actually the pony up real
2428820	2437220	money for you know PlayStation money so you have yet to buy anything from the new store
2437220	2441900	ah not yet from the new store be honest I haven't plugged in my PlayStation 3 in quite
2441900	2448380	a while what you're not helping to cure cancer even fuck cancer well one thing that I'm
2448380	2451180	just kind of surprised you haven't jumped out and downloaded although then again it
2451180	2457980	is kind of expensive Gran Turismo 5 prologue it is now on the PSN store it's 1.9 gigabytes
2457980	2463060	to download it 40 bucks if you want to download this by the full game at least you get a case
2463060	2470060	with it and if you stop playing it later on you can sell it for you know money the weird
2470060	2475140	thing is is that the intro video and the ending videos don't come with the game when you download
2475140	2480180	it but you can download them later to view which is kind of strange you can only get
2480180	2484560	the ending video of course after you've beaten Gran Turismo there's a whole documentary as
2484560	2489260	well beyond the apex which is apparently only on the blu-ray version of the game so I guess
2489260	2493380	you if you want a documentary you have that as well but seriously though that that's the
2493380	2498580	only thing I could see why would they I know why they offered you know these games available
2498580	2502500	to download but if they're offering a disc version of it I don't understand why people
2502500	2507300	don't buy the disc version of the game since you know that's the thing you may get tired
2507300	2511500	playing this game later on or say for example you want to sell it off before you know Gran
2511500	2516460	Turismo 5 comes out why can't you can't do that with the download version you have to
2516460	2520260	I can think it I think it may be two reasons one convenience especially for those that
2520260	2523580	may live in the middle of nowhere where it's harder to get to a store your only option
2523580	2530060	is like Walmart right to no sales tax in some places I don't know if because like I know
2530060	2533540	on Nintendo if you live in California you know you charge sales tax on we point same
2533540	2537300	thing with Xbox so I don't think on PlayStation which uses real money I don't think you get
2537300	2542460	charged sales tax which is kind of great so you save a few bucks there but just saying
2542460	2547300	I'm just saying though wouldn't you rather have a case and all that stuff for I don't
2547300	2551780	know I just like if a game came out on the Xbox Live Arcade and I had a choice of downloading
2551780	2556860	there or buying it in a store I'd buy it in a store that's just me I guess what about
2556860	2559740	the PopCap game well I guess those didn't come out till way later yeah they didn't come
2559740	2565460	out until way later and I mean I don't know RossDielUT is pointing out in chat Rob the
2565460	2569980	middle of nowhere isn't going to have broadband I guess that's kind of true well yes and no
2569980	2574540	I think broadband is really spreading out more and more especially as a satellite in
2574540	2579340	some form starting to support like a broadband-esque type of connection and really really middle
2579340	2584140	of nowhere there's always going to be a Walmart around they pop up like I guess it's Starbucks
2584140	2588380	all right maybe a bad excuse but I don't know just trying to think obviously somebody's
2588380	2592100	buying it or they wouldn't be putting it out there true well see here I like what they
2592100	2597620	did with Warhawk where they well originally they had it where you can buy the version
2597620	2602300	you know in stores and it came with a Bluetooth headset and that was how they kind of you
2602300	2605420	know you can do this and get all this extra stuff or if you don't want to buy that you
2605420	2609580	can just download the version of the game then later on they came out with the version
2609580	2617040	that's just the game only but I don't know it's still I would rather buy it on disk I
2617040	2622300	guess all right you used to mention you and the husband got this game this week right
2622300	2627720	grant that he wants a grand theft auto Gran Turismo yeah Dan was playing quite a bit of
2627720	2632180	it he had his cousin over playing it I didn't really watch it because you know me I don't
2632180	2638260	really give a crap was it pretty I said I didn't watch any of it I didn't give a crap
2638260	2642140	I thought maybe at least glanced at it once or twice I looked a little bit it was pretty
2642140	2647580	all right see that's what I was looking for but did you guys actually go get the box version
2647580	2653780	or did you download it I think that Dan bought it yeah he pranks the discount anyway because
2653780	2658300	the whole game store connection thing yeah probably yeah make sense but he was pretty
2658300	2662660	happy about it I mean he was like I was like so why do you and I straight out asked him
2662660	2667460	was like why did you want to pay money for glorify demo and he's like well honestly I
2667460	2673760	look at this as more of a part a you know sort of thing you know that the game comes
2673760	2681060	out this is almost a full game as it is it has a lot of content already he said you know
2681060	2685500	this is really makes me want the full version more when it comes out and I don't mind having
2685500	2690700	this to tide me over I was like well put that way I do sort of understand especially he's
2690700	2694460	so excited about everything that was there so far but he was so mad he tried to go buy
2694460	2698860	himself a Lancer Evo right off the bat and was seven thousand short don't I was like
2698860	2703220	haha but I mean your man's really into racing games this is seems like every time I go over
2703220	2706700	there there's something there's burnout or there's something you know there's a lot of
2706700	2711900	times I see racing games on the TV so yeah all right anyhow sorry I just thought I'd
2711900	2714980	ask because I know you're talking about that before the show but why don't we go into some
2714980	2720580	other gaming news well we do have other gaming news and this is about the PSP apparently
2720580	2730460	the PSP is still hot shit in Japan I don't know why but it is right now in order of systems
2730460	2738100	sold number six is the Xbox 360 PlayStation 2 is after that PlayStation 3 is after that
2738100	2745220	we is after that by quite a bit let me actually just go back and give the give the numbers
2745220	2761820	so Xbox 360 is at 1147 PlayStation 2 is 6834 PlayStation 3 is 8232 we is 46296 the DS 47158
2761820	2770460	and PSP at 85,721 if that's going to put it into perspective as far as what was sold in
2770460	2781240	the past week so just PSP is really got it now and actually I was looking through a couple
2781240	2789580	of back issues of Famitsu when I was at Kinokuniya and there were plenty of PSP ads just in terms
2789580	2797060	of ads there were just more and you know there's actually a couple of full just PSP only magazines
2797060	2801180	so I thought that was kind of interesting Loki any thoughts on why the PSP is really
2801180	2806460	taking off in Japan all of a sudden Monster Hunter I don't know they like the Monster
2806460	2814260	Hunter maybe Monster Hunter on PS3 that'd be pretty awesome could be okay for one game
2814260	2817660	I don't know if it's gonna be big in Japan but it's gonna be big everywhere else Grand
2817660	2824340	Theft Auto 4 it's gone gold and is apparently on the way to retail stores for you know one
2824340	2829740	lucky person at Target or Walmart to break street and probably have it out there early
2829740	2836300	like they do every time so keep your eyes out it'll be available soon also for everybody
2836300	2843100	you know on the 29th give me one of the greatest games this year that's for sure no fanboy

2887340	2897060	with Z okay wow apples no but hold back so yeah I get to go to Vegas I was actually thinking
2897060	2904380	about bringing my 360 with me to play you know during cuz I'm going for a day we're
2904380	2908800	actually training them on like different kind of giving them like the games 101 type shit
2908800	2912380	I'm sure they're I'm sure we have I know we have listeners in Vegas I'm sure there's some
2912380	2917480	out there would be like Loki come over we'll play I'll buy pizza and beer come on but here's
2917480	2922880	the thing my my boss reminded me he's all you know there's gonna be 360 is there so
2922880	2927140	you can just bring grant the thought or with you I'm like I know but I want to bring it
2927140	2932060	I don't know if I should bring it on the plane here to be in freaking Las Vegas and you want
2932060	2936200	to play a video game I'm like I'd be going out gambling going to shows screw video games
2936200	2941460	I don't have that I'm getting there late on Wednesday in the next day is a training thing
2941460	2948580	and then the day after that I'm leaving come back on Friday so and Gerardo mo and chat
2948580	2957260	says an unnamed website presents buying shoes online the game imagine buying shoes anyway
2957260	2970860	oh my god shoes this game rules this game sucks your controllers kind of big I don't
2970860	2977020	think we have anything in your size let's see moving on another series that people are
2977020	2984420	pretty into who likes their survival horror me do you like the game siren okay maybe not
2984420	2990900	well like it or not siren is getting a new translation that's what they call it it's
2990900	2995940	from from you to magazine it's siren new translation it's a PlayStation 3 remake actually that
2995940	3000780	might you know your magazine yeah I think it was it might actually be in there well
3000780	3004500	apparently you know if you forgot what the original game was all about it was these souls
3004500	3009580	were trying to get out of a Japanese village and they can only see through the eyes of
3009580	3014980	nearby creatures that's how it works July 24th is the day it's supposed to come out
3014980	3020860	but the demo is supposed to be out very very soon in Japan so if you were a fan of siren
3020860	3026380	and to which J rod and chat says siren is absolutely terrible avoided at all costs and
3026380	3031860	they also have a big likes well siren in the game that sounds just like the one from sound
3031860	3038620	hills well I don't want to say rip off because the game I think was out before so well tippo
3038620	3042780	says hooray for siren when nothing you do makes much sense you just have to do it anyway
3042780	3045820	what if they go back and fix all the problems that make the graphics even prettier would
3045820	3051300	that make this game worth owning I don't know hey you know nothing's gonna hurt having another
3051300	3054840	you know survivor horror game out there there really isn't that many yeah but then you just
3054840	3059540	have to keep reminding yourself Silent Hill 5 this year Silent Hill 5 this year well you
3059540	3064980	hope it's this year I hope it better be especially after seeing the little preview clips for
3064980	3074340	it I'm so freaking excited it's boneriffic I don't know if I'd go that far I couldn't
3074340	3078060	find the article that's all right how about some different gaming news then how about
3078060	3086540	some rock band all righty I'll take it well harmonix is gonna have up a downloadable album
3086540	3092620	for a rock band is gonna be available next week and it's called I'm screaming for vengeance
3092620	3100380	by Judas Priest and it has 10 tracks that will cost $15 and it's both for ps3 and Xbox
3100380	3108960	360 and each of the songs will be $2 apiece and then there's going to be a later on coming
3108960	3113500	in May there'll be an album by the cars and then do little by the Pixies the Pixies are
3113500	3119020	cool so it looks like they're just still working on trying to get those out I think that's
3119020	3124860	a kind of a neat idea and they said that though that they were supposed to have The Who have
3124860	3132340	a first downloadable album but they said that that's going to be later on it's very interesting
3132340	3136540	that they're going this download album route especially in the day and age where you know
3136540	3141020	I don't know this is probably a bit of a controversial statement but where music seems to be getting
3141020	3145340	away from the albums I mean sad but true we live in this iTunes world now where it's very
3145340	3149820	easy to buy the one song that you like and a lot of people don't ever take the time to
3149820	3153580	listen to the entire album so I find it kind of interesting the rock band is kind of going
3153580	3158580	this route where they're standing behind the albums in a way you know but I mean maybe
3158580	3161620	that's why you know when I read the news I was kind of surprised to see that they were
3161620	3166000	going for what really seems like the classics like it seems like they're going for the classics
3166000	3173100	more than anything right so that was kind of surprising but I guess when you think about
3173100	3177700	well in the classics that's when the albums were really albums maybe it's not so surprising
3177700	3183060	I don't know well you know and I also think that it's sad that we really don't have albums
3183060	3191420	as a big format anymore just because from an artistic point of view keep in mind what
3191420	3194620	all went into making an album you know with your cover and everything and you had all
3194620	3202500	the publishing I think that that actually is sort of a neat thing as far as its nostalgic
3202500	3208100	value you know what I mean I'm looking at chat comments hitstunz in chat that orange
3208100	3212500	on twitter.com says when I download stuff I get the whole album J rod says rock band
3212500	3220460	needs more modern metal act F says I'm an iTunes boy living in an iTunes world Sephiroth
3220460	3226500	1215 says I'm waiting for never mind to come out I'll get the whole album for that we'll
3226500	3232820	see that would be classic classic rock especially for this generation you know that early 90s
3232820	3236780	stuff is really the defining classic rock it's kind of interesting it's interesting
3236780	3243260	it's interesting I know I know we're getting old we ain't getting any younger but hey while
3243260	3247180	we age we have a lot of new games and things coming out around the world look forward to
3247180	3252060	so let's do some release dates yes this week actually there's gonna be something pretty
3252060	3256140	cool well about a week from now there will be something pretty cool because it's gonna
3256140	3262740	be coming out on Sunday Mario Kart Wii finally coming out in the US so you can take a look
3262740	3271380	at that very good game let's see other things coming out other than Mario Kart Wii there
3271380	3279180	is a game actually also on the Wii little known heavenly guardian it's a pretty cheap
3279180	3284260	game and it's kind of like a side scroll or shooter game so that's kind of cool there's
3284260	3292420	also NBA ballers chosen one which is coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
3292420	3302020	kind of a one-on-one two-on-two basketball game let's see there's also this week River
3302020	3310420	King Mystic Valley and that's like a fishing game fishing RPG I guess it's the what Harvest
3310420	3315780	Moon is to farming this is the fishing Battle of the Bands coming out on the Wii that's
3315780	3321560	that music game that doesn't require instruments but you have different mashups of music genres
3321560	3329860	in there this is kind of cool Wild Earth African Safari that's right it's the Pokemon snap
3329860	3335800	type of game that's for the Wii it's the Africa before Africa new game that's coming hell
3335800	3342500	ever happened to Africa are we gonna see that this Christmas maybe finally maybe this week
3342500	3347380	oh I gotta get this on the DS the world ends with you that apparently pretty awesome Square
3347380	3352860	Enix role-playing game so definitely worth checking out totally sounds like a James Bond
3352860	3356220	movie I think that I think that came up on last week's show we were talking about the
3356220	3361300	world ends with you James Bond like a bonus totally sounds like a bar this game you may
3361300	3367760	want to skip target terror and by Konami apparently one of the ugliest games for the Wii this
3367760	3374100	is a game that came out of the arcade circa 1990s with wonderful mocap technology kind
3374100	3382940	of think like area 51 and maximum force type things I don't know a chameleon on PSP another
3382940	3389060	little puzzle game this one's also pretty big Shin Megami tensei persona 3 FES this

3405920	3414260	of the Year editions coming out and let's see here and I believe that's actually it
3414260	3419300	yep that is it Jonathan F and Chad just said something I've been wondering about for the
3419300	3424140	longest time Phantasy Star Universe ambition of the illuminous max attack G begins I guess
3424140	3429140	this week play the old PSO stages in PSU that's the whole reason I downloaded ambition of
3429140	3433380	the illuminous not realizing they weren't there yet so god I hope I hope you can do

3471740	3476740	Vegas except that's just a price reduction on the PlayStation 3 trying to figure out
3476740	3481340	what this Valkyrie game is here it's it's actually a game that we're getting over here
3481340	3488020	in the fall it's a turn-based RPG it combines strategy with action and you proceed in the
3488020	3495960	game like it's a history book no it's not Valkyrie profile is it's from Sega so kind
3495960	3500600	of interesting you read text get involved with battle parts and depending on the option
3500600	3504860	you've chosen the battles you've thought or the battles you fought the game rewards you
3504860	3510780	with more chapters in the book so it's like you make history sounds kind of interesting

3731740	3737380	out this week on virtual console this week's two releases uh the first one being on the

3757020	3762660	um hey the rock band on the wii you know one of the big things is downloadable content
3762660	3767140	of course on the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 uh well unfortunately the wii doesn't have
3767140	3771160	the same setup so you might remember when it was announced uh that rock band was coming
3771160	3775820	to the wii they were going to have five bonus songs that the xbox 360 and the playstation
3775820	3781640	3 didn't have on the disc but they do have as downloadable content as we found out this
3781640	3786460	week the five bonus songs on the wii are just download songs from the other systems dirty
3786460	3791200	Little Secret by the All-American Rejects, Don't Look Back in Anger by Oasis, Rome by
3791200	3796380	the B-52s, Rockaway Beach by the Ramones, and You Don't Have to Turn Out the Red Light
3796380	3798860	for Roxanne by the Police.
3798860	3800000	Good songs!
3800000	3804680	I actually own two of those five as download songs, and I don't even own that many songs,
3804680	3808960	but a little bit disappointing to some that they are just simply download songs from the
3808960	3809960	other systems.
3809960	3813480	But they will be right there on the Wii disc to offset the fact that you won't be able
3813480	3817000	to download anything else for now, for a while.
3817000	3821760	Well, we've got a whole bunch of downloadable content for the week.

3938800	3941400	Drive game for 800 Wii points.
3941400	3948880	In US and Canada, we got Fantasy Zone for Master System, yay, and Mega Turrican.
3948880	3954280	For PC, a demo of Kung Fu Panda came out, whatever Kung Fu Panda is.
3954280	3955280	Sounds pretty awesome.
3955280	3956280	I guess.
3956280	3962000	Kung Fu Panda, that's based on the Jack Black film, I think.
3962000	3963360	Oh, okay.
3963360	3969520	Steam brought out Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Trackmania United, which gives free access to Trackmania
3969520	3973200	United Forever, and Trackmania United Forever was also free.
3973200	3976880	Well, the Trackmania United was 40 bucks.
3976880	3981920	Metabolie Ultimate Collection, Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, Exo Cubes, Essential Collection
3981920	3985400	is Heroes of Might and Magic 5.
3985400	3989200	That'd be all R. Damn you, Jamie.
3989200	3992160	Well, now I have Message in a Bottle stuck in my head.
3992160	3995160	This is the best police song ever.
3995160	3996160	Message in a Bottle.
3996160	3997160	Message in a Bottle.
3997160	4004560	This is my favorite police song ever, ever, and the fair degrees too.
4004560	4007200	That was not Message in a Bottle, that was Gibberish.
4007200	4008480	That was Gibberish and a ferret.
4008480	4016240	All right, so we know that Mario Kart is already out now in Japan and Europe.
4016240	4020440	Now you would think, of course, Nintendo game, it's gonna be probably the top-selling game
4020440	4022360	ever.
4022360	4023880	Not really in its first week, actually.
4023880	4025820	In Japan, it didn't fare too well.
4025820	4033840	It ended up being number three, beaten out by Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G, and another
4033840	4043120	not really a game, but a UMD video, Boku Daki no Kaji-Tsu, and that actually translates
4043120	4051800	to Only My Fruit, and it's an erotic, like, hentai UMD video or game or something.
4051800	4052800	So that's kind of funny.
4052800	4056720	Erotic PSP game beats out Mario Kart Wii.
4056720	4061200	If only they had more jubilees in Mario Kart Wii, maybe.
4061200	4067080	Nintendo is sending out an SOS about right now.
4067080	4069560	Seriously, how to get beaten by porn.
4069560	4072840	I mean, is this like something that's really, really popular in Japan or something, this
4072840	4073840	series?
4073840	4074840	Yeah, Akihabara.
4074840	4075840	Huh.
4075840	4079200	Wait, but this is only, also, this is only one store's chart, right?
4079200	4080680	This isn't like the whole country's chart.
4080680	4081680	No, this is Akihabara.
4081680	4086720	All right, so maybe it's a little bit much to say that OMG, Mario Kart Wii gets its butt
4086720	4088600	kicked by porn in the entirety of Japan.
4088600	4090100	No, it's just one store.
4090100	4092920	And maybe this is the only store where you can buy this particular game.
4092920	4097240	Sort of like how here, you know, Walmarts and Targets don't carry certain games, right?
4097240	4098240	Yeah.
4098240	4099240	Maybe.
4099240	4101240	If they only carry more porn games, you know.
4101240	4103160	Who knows?
4103160	4104160	We'll see.
4104160	4111280	Well, speaking of Wii fun times in Japan, Resident Evil 0 has been given a date for
4111280	4112280	Japan.
4112280	4115520	Now, of course, this game was already on the GameCube, but, you know, Resident Evil 4 on
4115520	4117600	the Wii turned out pretty good, so hell, why not?
4117600	4118600	Let's port this over.
4118600	4121240	July 10th will be the day that this comes out.
4121240	4125000	4,190 yen will be the price.
4125000	4129640	Now, it's only announced for Japan right now, but, you know, if this sells over in Japan,
4129640	4131440	I don't see why they wouldn't bring this over here.
4131440	4136400	Like I said, Resident Evil 4 Wii didn't do too bad, so why the hell not?
4136400	4137400	Excuse me.
4137400	4140360	There you have it.
4140360	4147760	Well, there has been an ESRB game rating released because of blood and fantasy violence, and
4147760	4150320	it's set for something on the Nintendo DS.
4150320	4152320	Can we guess what that is?
4152320	4153320	Huh?
4153320	4155360	Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.
4155360	4158200	Hey, didn't we talk about this a couple weeks ago?
4158200	4160440	Yep, it is for the DS.
4160440	4161440	Who would've thought, kid?
4161440	4164200	Who would've thought that those secrets slip out and...
4164200	4165200	I like fantasy violence.
4165200	4166200	Sure enough.
4166200	4167820	It sounds kinda dirty.
4167820	4170480	Don't all the Castlevania games have fantasy violence?
4170480	4172720	Don't any game have fantasy violence?
4172720	4174360	Any good game has fantasy violence.
4174360	4176240	All games have fantasy violence.
4176240	4178960	But the best ones have real violence.
4178960	4180720	None of them have real violence.
4180720	4182680	It's all fantasy.
4182680	4190600	It's all you perceiving one character beating up another, but it's just fucking data.
4190600	4191600	You know what, though?
4191600	4193920	WhatTheyPlay.com Snap will have real violence.
4193920	4195900	But will it blend?
4195900	4196900	We hope.
4196900	4200360	I don't know if it'll blend, since it's an idea.
4200360	4204760	I don't think you can get ideas into a blender.
4204760	4205760	Just yet.
4205760	4209880	It'll be a new blender with mind control capabilities.
4209880	4213120	You never know.
4213120	4214120	I don't know if this'll blend.
4214120	4216280	It may blend on the Wii.
4216280	4223120	But apparently Namco has announced another, yes, there is actually another already, cheerleader
4223120	4224600	game for the Wii.
4224600	4226260	It's called Wii Cheer.
4226260	4234040	It features cartoony cheerleaders jumping around and stuff, and you apparently use the
4234040	4238600	game, each one of your pom-poms, I guess, in the game is actually a Wii remote.
4238600	4245560	So you use two Wii remotes and kind of think like a Wii version of yet another cheering
4245560	4248000	game, Oh and Done, or Elite Beat Agents.
4248000	4251200	It's kind of like that, is how you play the game.
4251200	4256600	I would be interested in this if they had just called it Bring It On, the game.
4256600	4259280	And it forces you to use spirit fingers.
4259280	4263320	Spirit fingers.
4263320	4264720	That movie was...
4264720	4265720	Was incredible.
4265720	4266720	I don't know.
4266720	4269000	That's the only way you're allowed to finish that sentence.
4269000	4274580	Don't get me wrong, this is like, I guess, a cool idea for girls, because the video,
4274580	4276700	the trailer showed girls playing this game.
4276700	4279040	Why's it gotta be an only a girl game, huh?
4279040	4281480	Well, because they showed little girls playing the game.
4281480	4283440	Do you want to play a game that little girls play?
4283440	4284440	Maybe.
4284440	4286720	I don't know.
4286720	4289160	This is kind of...
4289160	4290480	I don't think I could play this game.
4290480	4293600	I would feel dirty playing this game.
4293600	4296440	Okay I gotta look at some of this trailer.
4296440	4301400	Aw, little girls dancing and happy.
4301400	4303960	This makes horrible radio.
4303960	4310400	Oh yes, and they butcher the songs, by the way.
4310400	4316560	So they're probably going to be all horrible cover versions.
4316560	4318520	Create your own cheerleader, Jamie, custom mode.
4318520	4319520	Look at that.
4319520	4321520	You like that, don't you?
4321520	4322520	Alright I'll end the...
4322520	4323520	I'd probably make a cheerleader...
4323520	4324880	I'll end the torture for our chat.
4324880	4327760	...killer or something.
4327760	4330880	They look like they're all having fun.
4330880	4332240	That's what games are all about, right?
4332240	4335440	Because they're paid to look like they're having fun.
4335440	4337040	What was the game called again?
4337040	4338040	We cheer.
4338040	4339740	We cheer.
4339740	4342120	Just like we ski.
4342120	4343120	We cheer.
4343120	4345740	We starve ourselves to fit in the outfit.
4345740	4348800	They do kind of look like they have starved themselves.
4348800	4349800	They're children.
4349800	4350800	Be nice.
4350800	4353240	They're children on TV.
4353240	4358280	Then they'll have the, you know, We Need to Get to Dallas, the Debbie Does Dallas sequel
4358280	4363200	for the game.
4363200	4366120	Fireboma says, Sky's sold as soon as he hears that song.
4366120	4367200	It is a good song.
4367200	4369000	Who doesn't like that song?
4369000	4370000	Don't it feel good?
4370000	4375040	I actually am really annoyed by that song.
4375040	4377680	Well poop on you.
4377680	4379120	Sorry Debbie Downer.
4379120	4380520	Wah wah.
4380520	4381520	Hey Rob.
4381520	4382520	What?
4382520	4383520	Rob.
4383520	4384520	Rob.
4384520	4385520	Rob.
4385520	4386520	Rob.
4386520	4387520	Rob.
4387520	4388520	Rob.
4388520	4389520	Rob.
4389520	4390520	Rob.
4390520	4391520	Rob.
4391520	4392520	Channel Z says they show a boy playing at the end of the We Cheer video.
4392520	4393520	Boys can be cheerleaders.
4393520	4394520	Why not?
4394520	4395520	Smart boys are cheerleaders.
4395520	4396520	You know why?
4396520	4397520	Why?
4397520	4400520	Because they get to put their hands up the girls' skirts all day long.
4400520	4401520	Alright.
4401520	4402520	Touche.
4402520	4403520	Huh?
4403520	4405960	How can you respond to that?
4405960	4406960	You can't.
4406960	4407960	Exactly.
4407960	4408960	Alright.
4408960	4409960	If you saw Bring It On, you'd know this.
4409960	4412880	There was the gay cheerleader who was, you know, cheerleading because he was gay.
4412880	4416360	And then there was the cheerleader who was, you know, just there to hit on all the women.
4416360	4418000	Yeah, that's the thing.
4418000	4423080	He can hit on all the women, but he ain't gonna get any of them.
4423080	4424920	Alright.
4424920	4427040	Let's look at another game here.
4427040	4429480	It's Okami on the Wii.
4429480	4438160	And the funny thing about Okami on the Wii is that, well, the box art is kind of screwy.
4438160	4440920	And when I say screwy, I mean stolen.
4440920	4441920	That's right.
4441920	4447720	If you look very carefully at the Okami box art, apparently you can zoom in on a portion
4447720	4448720	of it.
4448720	4452080	It's not far from the dog's mouth there, the wolf or whatever you want to call it.
4452080	4458880	If you zoom in on that, you can see very faintly a watermark that says IGN.
4458880	4466040	In other words, Capcom lifted the IGN art from the website or whatever to make the Wii
4466040	4469440	box art for Okami.
4469440	4470440	Isn't that funny?
4470440	4473160	They stole their own artwork from a website.
4473160	4474360	I think that's really funny.
4474360	4477320	I don't know why.
4477320	4480480	And apparently it's legit.
4480480	4482720	You can go look at a box for this game and it's there.
4482720	4487560	I don't know if they'll be able to fix it at one point, at some point later, but apparently
4487560	4490480	the press releases that have gone out already have this on there.
4490480	4491480	People have confirmed it.
4491480	4494000	There you have it.
4494000	4496840	Frisbee in chat says, Capcom googled their own box art.
4496840	4497840	Apparently they did.
4497840	4500020	There you have it.
4500020	4501280	Someone's getting fired.
4501280	4502280	Someone totally got fired.
4502280	4503280	Ha, ha, ha.
4503280	4504280	All right.
4504280	4508880	We're about ready to take a break here and go from part A to part B, but first it just
4508880	4515640	would not be an Orange Ons Radio part A if we did not pay tribute to video game classics.
4515640	4519040	And we do that with a little segment here on the show called our classic video game
4519040	4522760	of the week.
4522760	4526600	Dark Sakura goes through her vast archives of video games and picks out one classic for
4526600	4528960	you all to pay respect to.
4528960	4531280	What's it going to be this week, Dark Sakura?
4531280	4532280	Strider.
4532280	4536800	Bitches better recognize.
4536800	4541400	And unfortunately the only copy of the first level that I could find was the Genesis version.
4541400	4546200	However, this was one of the first of their eight meg titles that they bought out.
4546200	4548760	Oh, you can't start it past where the music is.
4548760	4549760	Wait.
4549760	4550760	Don't you start at the very beginning?
4550760	4551760	Yeah.
4551760	4552760	Yeah.
4552760	4553760	Right there.
4553760	4554760	This is classic.
4554760	4564400	But this is the game that actually in Japan was called Strider Yu Yu and it gave us the
4564400	4571040	character from Ronald vs. Capcom, but basically it's a platformer and it's actually very
4571040	4578520	interesting because all of the in-between areas are basically the characters speaking
4578520	4582240	their native languages, but they're speaking them to each other and can apparently understand
4582240	4583240	everybody else.
4583240	4588160	I guess they have translators in the future like that, but you go through different levels
4588160	4594040	and the first one starts off, you have to fight this guy called Grandmaster Mayo and
4594040	4596840	you're going through different areas.
4596840	4603880	You start off in the Soviet Union, the next one is, I think the next level is in Siberia.
4603880	4610960	There you have the Amazon rainforest, you've got a big platform in space and actually this
4610960	4614920	is my favorite level to do because as you're going through that you are on the ground and
4614920	4618400	then gravity reverses and you're in other areas and then you have to fight this thing
4618400	4620400	that you move in a circle around.
4620400	4626000	But his weapon is called a cypher, which is like this swinging tonfa style blade, but
4626000	4630800	as you get power up he'll extend further and he'll get his little mechanical animal buddies
4630800	4640560	to help him out, like a falcon and a big saber tooth tiger and his little things that, okay,
4640560	4646240	I don't think they actually got names until Marvel vs Capcom came out, but the little
4646240	4652680	tiny things were called Ouroboros, but that was also one of the bosses in the game too.
4652680	4657920	Okay the stage in this was St. Petersburg, the Siberian wilderness, the aerial battleship,
4657920	4665080	Amazon, and the third moon, but it was just a really kind of an epic sort of game.
4665080	4673240	The thing about the in between areas is that, for example, after you fight, there's the
4673240	4678240	area where you fight three girls with the bosses and one of them is Pompou who was also
4678240	4685320	one of the helper characters in Marvel vs Capcom, but she speaks Chinese, produced Japanese,
4685320	4693360	the bounty hunter guy speaks English, I see they didn't do it on the on the Genesis one
4693360	4697040	for the arcade one, it had all the places.
4697040	4700680	It also, there were other versions that came out, like the one that we were listening to
4700680	4709000	was the the Genesis one, but it's been on the Amiga, the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore
4709000	4719320	64, ZX Spectrum, and there's been a Master System version and a Sharp X68000 version.
4719320	4726840	There was one on, we actually have a burn of this, the version that was going to be
4726840	4738240	Super Graphics CD, we actually have a copy of the proto for it, but we don't have the
4738240	4743000	arcade card to play it with.
4743000	4750200	There's also, I will tell people that there is a Nintendo version, however, just to let
4750200	4756160	people know is that that was actually based off of the Strider comics that came out in
4756160	4761600	Japan and is not anything like, it's very interesting because when I, you know, I didn't
4761600	4765640	have a Genesis growing up, we only had a Nintendo, but I do remember Strider on the Nintendo
4765640	4770200	and I love that game, but it is completely different than this game.
4770200	4773880	This game is more of like a platformer, where as Strider on the NES was a bit more like
4773880	4774880	Adventure.
4774880	4781200	Yeah, it was a bit more Bionic Commando and that triangle jump made me want to kill people,
4781200	4785320	but I mean, it's so interesting that you have both games that were Strider yet, they were
4785320	4786680	so completely freaking different.
4786680	4787680	This is very interesting.
4787680	4791280	Well, part of the reason with this was they were actually going to leave out the, as far
4791280	4796400	as I'm aware, now this is coming from my husband and for anyone who kept up on older video
4796400	4802040	game sites, my husband used to run one called Neo Strider Strider Zone and I did all, I,
4802040	4808360	you know, fixed all of his graphics on it for him, but Dan is like full of Strider trivia,
4808360	4813800	but he's like, when they were first going to bring it out on Genesis slash Mega Drive,
4813800	4817720	that there wasn't enough memory to accommodate the full game, they were going to leave out
4817720	4824920	the Amazon level and ended up just creating their 8 meg cartridges to, to accommodate
4824920	4825920	the entire game.
4825920	4829560	And I have to say, it's pretty damn close to arcade perfect.
4829560	4831360	It's very, very good.
4831360	4840160	And for anyone who picked up the, this sequel, there actually was one called Strider Returns,
4840160	4845360	that was a journey from darkness Strider Returns, but it was really kind of shitty.
4845360	4848800	But we had Marvel versus Capcom, like I kept mentioning, and he was in, it was basically
4848800	4856480	all of his moves for the game, Hideo and Hien, who was in Strider 2, were in the Namco Capcom
4856480	4857480	game.
4857480	4862640	And there was also, the lead programmer of Strider left Capcom and created a game called
4862640	4870600	Osman, which was also called Canon Dancer, and a lot, it plays basically just like Strider
4870600	4872760	is a lot of the same type of game.
4872760	4878960	It did get a really good sequel called Strider 2, which was really freaking good, but that'll
4878960	4883000	be touched on at a later date.
4883000	4886040	So Strider 2 is different than Strider Returns?
4886040	4887040	Or are they the same?
4887040	4892040	Yeah, Strider Returns was more of a, it was just awful.
4892040	4896200	In fact, the story that it brought up was actually retconned because of Strider 2, the
4896200	4898360	real Strider 2 that came out.
4898360	4902400	And the one that came out was, I think, a worthy sequel.
4902400	4908160	Oh, that's the Amazon level, when you fight the girls that, this is someone doing a speedrun
4908160	4912440	of the game, they use the emulator cheats though, but it's a speedrun in seven and a
4912440	4913440	half minutes.
4913440	4915000	He's fighting the half naked Amazon ladies.
4915000	4916000	Hot.
4916000	4920080	All right, well there you have it, your classic game of the week Strider for the arcade and
4920080	4924280	the Genesis or Mega Drive, whatever region you happen to live in.
4924280	4925280	Check it out.
4925280	4931720	Especially, and I would suggest this too, even though technically the Strider NES version
4931720	4935440	was not the classic game of the week, I would suggest if you've only ever played one, try
4935440	4939120	the other and just see how radically different they are for a little bit.
4939120	4944640	They are, well actually if anyone does want to check out the older one, there was a Game
4944640	4951600	Boy Advance release called Capcom Classics Mini Mix that had the NES version of Strider,
4951600	4955720	Bionic Commando, and Mighty Final Fight, so that's also another way that people can check
4955720	4956720	it out.
4956720	4957720	All right, very cool.
4957720	4960560	And besides that, Mighty Final Fight is just fun too.
4960560	4962860	Yeah, it's kind of silly fun.
4962860	4964200	It's basically chibi final fight.
4964200	4965600	At least it had Guy in it, right?
4965600	4966600	It did, yeah.
4966600	4967600	That's why you need me.
4967600	4968600	That's why I have Final Fight Guy.
4968600	4971620	All right, we're going to go ahead and take a break here on Orange Laundry Radio, plenty
4971620	4973660	more to come in part B tonight.
4973660	4976880	We're going to talk about some more Grand Theft Auto news.
4976880	4977880	Can you believe it?
4977880	4978880	Lots of stuff.
4978880	4982040	Talking about Bionic Commando Rearmed a little bit as well, and somebody dared to say that
4982040	4983520	Wii games look like crap.
4983520	4984520	Who would have thought?
4984520	4988000	We'll talk all about that in part B right after a quick break.
4988000	4992560	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
4992560	4993560	a week.
4993560	5006520	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
