5873	14719	To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15419	19062	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20322	21623	Orange Lounge Radio
41048	41809	I want to say it was the bow.
66988	67648	and DarkSakura.
95635	96916	The Cars Are All Ghost Cars
120703	148270	so yeah that's pretty awesome I guess that's coming in August but I'm really looking forward to the expansions for the maps whenever the hell those are going to come out what is the obsession with motorcycles in racing games lately because you know we had Project Gotham 4 right added them and then we have Mario Kart Wii is now all of a sudden got motorcycles and now Burnout it's like 2008 is the year of motorcycle well I guess Project Gotham came out in 07 but still it's like you know all the rage right now what's up with that
149346	150266	I don't know, something different.
150707	151167	I guess.
151727	154288	Do you prefer motorcycle racing to car racing?
154709	155549	I don't prefer either.
156689	159631	I prefer, well, I'd have to say I like car better.
159891	164893	I think motorcycle racing is much cooler when you have a stick that you beat people with off the side of the car.
164913	165714	Yes, exactly, road rush.
165734	172437	Personally, I'm more of a fan of when they had Need for Speed 2, and then this is not Underground 2 or anything like that.
172497	174198	It's like the second Need for Speed game.
174858	176540	Outhouse as a giant T-Rex statue.
192386	192666	DarkSakura
216545	224691	All right, well, one game we love here at Orange Lounge Radio is the Eye of Judgment, which, by the way, I checked the Orange Lounge Radio wiki today.
225011	241563	Since we have no official Wikipedia entry anymore because some a-hole nuked it, we now have our own wiki, orangeloungeradio.wikia.com, and I was looking at the latest Eye of Judgment sales figures, which now our chatters are tracking for us, just shy of 200,000 worldwide.
241743	242443	Never going to happen.
243624	244425	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
264707	265067	Whatever.
265408	268450	They're the Eye of Judgment set-to-promo cards.
268850	272673	All you have to do, you watch the official PlayStation blog starting next Friday.
273153	279058	And, oh, I see why they're rare, because you have to be one of the first few hundred who registers with the mailing list, and then you get the rarities.
279098	280859	So only a few hundred of these are going to go out.
282140	284421	Or... One of them will be Xeroxed and put all over the internet.
284441	287924	Or you could just Xerox the ones right there that are available on the website.
287984	288344	No, no, no.
288364	288844	Here's the thing.
288884	292125	The ones that are going around blogs, though, you've got to look at those black bars carefully.
292185	293906	Those black bars are what the Eye of Judgment reads.
293926	295226	They're all the same on these cards.
295846	297507	So not that easy, Loki.
298107	298687	Oh, darn.
298767	302749	I guess we'll just have to wait for one of the hundreds of people that actually... Oh, who cares?
302809	303509	No one plays the game.
303549	304069	It doesn't matter.
304949	306550	All right.
306610	308550	BlackWolf is in chat.
308590	309891	He actually owns Eye of Judgment.
309931	313032	He was a big supporter of trying to move a million copies of them.
313352	315372	He says the best part is that you have to pay $14.99 just to use those cards.
317566	317986	Awesome.
318126	319507	Since, you know, you gotta get set too.
319667	319987	Awesome.
320007	320807	Way to support that.
321327	321787	Good job.
323308	326269	Sadly, we don't get to count expansion sales towards our million.
326329	326469	Nope.
327249	328349	Doesn't matter anyways.
328449	331830	But we do get to count sales of Let's Ride Friends Forever, let's not forget.
333271	334271	Yeah, all ten of those.
335391	338692	Well, another game that we're not counting is Portal.
339933	342033	Otherwise, Loki would be in that tingle suit right now.
343494	344834	It's a good thing we didn't count Portal.
346235	372037	well basically they have said from Valve that we will not be seeing a new portal this year but they are going to do a new game that is as revolutionary they say as Half-Life 2 was to the original Half-Life he's quoted as saying it won't be portal with different colors so we're going to be getting something new from Valve I say good for them
373004	373764	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
404537	406318	Just, you know, will it be good?
407379	409720	Dartetsuya in chat suggests Portal 2.
409841	411161	No, really, there's cake this time.
412863	416225	No, no, no, because the cake is made with, like, dust.
417386	419367	I say in Portal 2 you're going after pie.
419447	420267	What's better than cake?
420388	420688	Pie.
421208	421668	There you go.
421929	422689	I had a birthday pie.
424249	425110	I want a birthday pie.
425991	430977	If I can eat pie by that time, because, you know, the whole pancreas drama of mine.
431157	433460	You know what's in two weeks for us?
433800	433980	What?
434121	434641	Margaret Cho.
434741	435302	I know.
435322	436644	Your birthday present a little late.
436684	437324	Let's get pie.
438426	439006	If I can eat it.
439467	441529	It might have to be low-fat Weight Watchers pie.
442711	443572	Fat-free cheesecake.
443592	444413	I'd rather eat barf.
446703	451666	Well, it's not cake, but it's definitely coming a lot sooner than Portal 2.
452706	456108	It is the releases on the PlayStation Network this week.
457708	465952	And there's some pretty interesting stuff, like the Echo Chrome demo that's been released out now for, I believe, the PlayStation Portable.
466812	473455	And you can also download some PlayStation 1 classics for R-Type, including R-Type 1 and R-Type 2.
475696	476777	And that's available for $6.
477878	481982	And they also have, of course, the variety map pack for Call of Duty 4 for PlayStation 3.
483303	492471	And if you happen to be a fan of Karaoke Revolution, American Idol, Encore, they've added a variety of new songs you can check out there as well.
494173	495094	And let's see here.
495654	503299	Also, of course, the Eye of Judgment Violeth Rebellion 2 expansion set is available to download for $15.
503339	504680	The typical rock band stuff.
504700	506882	Guitar Hero 3 Deaf Leopard Pack.
507682	510384	There's an Army of Two SSE Challenge Pack.
511785	513706	Demo for Iron Man on the PlayStation 3.
513946	517949	Resistance Fall Man 2 teaser trailer.
518069	523393	And there's some other stuff from different game videos and stuff.
524613	526113	and some free stuff.
526694	533595	Eye of Judgment theme number two for free and the PlayStation 3 wallpaper for Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.
535095	543737	And on the PSP store, they're actually still selling full games on there because remember, you can download full PSP games including LocoRoco, which is $21.99.
543777	545457	They've got, let's see here.
549847	551868	I guess that's the only new free game.
552529	556432	Well, it's not free, but... $21.99, that's a free deal.
556472	557832	Free after $21.99.
559894	561875	Free with $21.99 download fee.
562035	564377	There's also Kingdom of Paradise, which is $10.99.
565217	566979	I don't know.
567839	579507	That kind of sucks, though, because the money that you put into the PlayStation Store and stuff like that, it's in whole dollars, so you're stuck with these remainder cents that you get ripped off on on each purchase.
580933	583036	Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus Guilty Gear
598089	600670	This is coming to the PSP.
600970	604791	They call it the most complete and balanced version of the game to date.
605271	608572	So what happens is that also the game is going to have an ad hoc mode.
608592	610052	You can do three on three tournaments.
610933	613393	I guess if you have the whole wireless thing going on.
613413	614034	So that would be fun.
614594	615374	I like Guilty Gear.
615734	620495	This information, by the way, coming from Famitsu Magazine, who is pretty reputable.
620595	622896	So this game is coming out for the PSP.
623556	624537	So good times.
624597	625837	Guilty Gear in your pocket.
626837	627177	Grand Theft Auto 4
644727	649972	Well, you know how we were chatting about that little rumor about there being a special bundle for PS3?
651193	652234	It's not a rumor.
653095	664345	It's going to be released on April 29th as a 40-gig unit with a 6-axis controller and stuff.
665826	669910	And by the way, this is the European bundle, to be specific.
670510	671071	It will be â‚¬4.39.
673453	677616	So if you care that much about it, go get it, I guess.
680599	681500	Go get it, I guess.
683762	686324	DarkSakura reviews games here on Orange Launch Radio.
687485	688306	Go get it, I guess.
689272	690133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
706391	709552	That's why they sell, you know, monitor adapters and stuff like that.
709632	710332	I play on my computer monitor.
710352	711833	I don't even have a good monitor.
712213	712613	You know what?
712693	714214	I have that little Disney... You know what?
714234	718975	I have this Disney Princesses TV I never got a chance to use that I got for my birthday.
719595	721296	You want to take that and hook something up to it?
721556	721796	Okay.
723337	724477	I'll call it Dance TV.
724977	726698	Sad thing is, I think she's serious.
729229	730050	We'll see what happens.
730591	732534	I'm all for more DarkSakura game reviews.
745652	747753	That's a lot of karaoke.
747793	757958	Apparently the SingStar online store has 140,000 registered users and over 20,000 user submitted videos.
758558	762520	None of which are of me because I don't own the game nor will ever own the game.
763560	765521	And have been watched over 2.5 million times.
767850	782295	The franchise has also sold 12 million copies over its multiple iterations including SingStar Bollywood and it's due out over here next month on the 20th I believe.
785777	786217	Alright.
787774	789876	So check that out, I guess.
790216	791737	SingStar when it comes out over here.
792197	793278	Although Loki won't be.
794178	798541	I think I'm going to buy it and then get Loki drunk and then see what happens.
798982	800203	If we can get him on the TV.
801003	801864	It might be worth it.
803345	806246	Listeners, let's do a quick poll in chat.
806346	806986	Quick poll.
807086	807586	Here we go.
807727	808487	Answer the question.
808767	816249	Y or N. Is it worth the $600 investment for a PlayStation 3 simply to upload Loki drunk karaoke to the interwebs?
816269	818850	Y or N. You'd also have to buy a PlayStation Eye.
820431	820691	All right.
820731	823192	Is it worth the $650 adjustment or whatever?
823532	824492	Let's throw in booze.
824552	825273	Is it worth the $700 investment?
825293	825373	Loki.
829744	830704	I'm not going to do that.
831085	831825	Answer question.
832365	832745	Let's see.
832846	834466	Oh, we have some answers coming in already.
834546	834927	Let's see.
834987	851234	We have Y, Y, N from Cheeseburger, F and Y, so Y, hell fucking Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, lowercase Y. I think... And then we have Dora the Explorer TV is greater than Disney Princess TV.
851254	852095	That wasn't the question!
853951	854931	Ace of Spades
882068	884710	With some guy.
885571	889415	I'll sing, but I'll make you turn around and I'll just say I'm David Cook.
891657	892798	And then you'll get all excited.
893558	893879	Anyhow.
895060	898083	By the way, guys, Jamie is hella into American Idol this year.
898123	898743	It's hilarious.
901446	901466	I...
904741	905442	It's not funny.
905562	906362	No, it's hilarious.
906402	907003	It's great.
907343	908324	Why is it funny?
908444	909905	Because it's cute.
910025	911466	They got rid of that bitch Carly, though.
911606	912487	I like her!
912507	915049	Alright, shut up right now.
915369	916570	Video game podcast.
916590	918972	First of all, did you listen to her old shit?
919692	922755	She sings so much better now than she did five years ago.
922815	923315	Too bad.
923735	927198	On top of that, they said that she had the best performance ever.
927258	930480	It's just a stupid fucking popularity contest, but David Cook is still gonna win.
931821	932422	That is true.
934434	934794	That's it.
934875	936658	I'm changing my cage match song.
937299	938140	I'll give you a dollar.
938641	939542	Alright, fine.
941786	942447	He's great.
943128	943669	You know what?
943869	944831	They can all kiss my ass.
944851	945873	We have games to talk about.
948280	948560	Is this?
948740	948900	Oh.
949560	949800	Is it?
949840	953181	No, we have an international story.
953261	953561	We do.
953781	956102	We have an international story straight out of Singapore.
956582	957422	They caned somebody.
958162	960502	No, they did not cane somebody, but I don't know.
960562	962543	They may have some type of crazy outbreak here.
962583	963103	Here's the thing.
963403	967924	There's a brand new rating system that has been announced in Singapore.
968004	971505	Rating systems are overall a good thing as long as people are educated on them.
971525	973425	But here's the kind of weak point about it.
974446	978469	People Like Us has identified a problem with the rating system.
978770	983834	People Like Us, by the way, is a Singapore gay and lesbian group focused on advocacy and public education.
984295	984955	Here's the thing.
985576	990320	If a game contains homosexuality, it is instantly an adult theme rating.
991101	994843	Just because you might have some hot girl on girl action like you have in Mass Effect.
995283	997084	So here's a quote from People Like Us.
997384	1000305	People Like Us considers this new rule unjustifiably strict.
1000605	1007388	Children should not have to be kept ignorant about the presence of gay people in society any more than they should be shielded from people of other faiths and ethnicities.
1007828	1011750	The path to acceptance of gay people is through teaching children and diversity from a young age.
1012330	1020214	It is pejorative to lump gay sexual orientation with crime and drug use as the MDA's new guidelines do as if gay orientation is some kind of social threat.
1020934	1032388	Now, I think it goes without saying that obviously it's kind of stupid because this is the equivalent of Brokeback Mountain is automatically an NC-17 rated movie because, you know, oh my god, butt sex, right?
1033048	1034830	So, here's the thing.
1034850	1035411	But it's hot.
1036633	1038134	Here's the thing is that, okay...
1040131	1045056	The even kind of bigger issue here is that, like, are there really that many games that this is going to affect?
1045116	1046037	I mean, don't get me wrong.
1046457	1047158	I totally agree.
1047218	1050682	It's stupid that this would be, you know, cause the game to get into adults only rating.
1051022	1053665	But are there really that many games that are going to fall into this category?
1053825	1056227	I mean, how many gay characters in games do we have?
1057028	1058129	Sadly, not a lot.
1058489	1059470	And I'm not saying that...
1060431	1060772	Shut up.
1061092	1076430	I'm not saying that we suddenly have to get all these games to come out that have OMG, a token gay in them, or a gay lead character, but I think it would be nice if in an RPG or something, and I'm not talking about Enchanted Arms and that Makoto guy, okay?
1076470	1077231	I'm not even talking about that.
1077612	1078933	I'm talking about, I think it would be great
1079594	1080635	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1104913	1105113	Huh?
1105353	1106314	Where?
1106354	1110816	You know what on the internet, but I'm saying at least in their personal lives.
1110836	1112657	I think most people are just like, whatever.
1112797	1114718	It's no big deal in this day and age anymore.
1114818	1116458	It's just people are different.
1117679	1132746	And I would like to see that same attitude in games, but I know there's some people that have that archaic attitude of, well, you know, then don't put it in Grand Theft Auto, but there's plenty of other games that would be just fine with it.
1135277	1136117	Sky's voice the game.
1136858	1138978	No.
1139118	1146161	Seg in chat says, it's not about existing games, but it's the reason that sexuality themes are limited because of rating systems would overreact.
1146501	1150423	You know, that's kind of true too, is that how often is sexuality even a factor in games?
1151203	1152983	Violence, hell yeah, everywhere.
1153104	1155244	Cursing, even start to see more and more.
1155664	1156445	Sexuality?
1157245	1157765	Not so much.
1158105	1166628	Because OMG boobs get you an instant auto I'm a walking MC-70 movie rating.
1169549	1170389	People are sad.
1171069	1171689	It's just silly.
1172890	1176651	I would do the FUs of the week right here, but it's just, I don't know.
1178372	1184313	Sadly, it's not surprising, but I think the bigger issue is there's not a lot of games that are going to fall into this category.
1184794	1186114	Why don't we work on that first?
1189224	1189545	That's it.
1190946	1192348	Now we can move on to your story, Jamie.
1193069	1193549	Now it's time.
1194490	1196192	Okay.
1196693	1200477	The beta for Battlefield Heroes is going to be in May.
1203462	1203982	That's it?
1204282	1205723	What the hell is Battlefield Heroes?
1205743	1206743	I've never even heard of this game.
1206763	1207624	It's on the 6th.
1207704	1213766	It's a free-to-play cartoon sort of version of an online shooting series.
1215406	1218388	The ads, it's actually funded by ads, but it's not in-game.
1218448	1219108	It's on the website.
1219328	1220228	Oh, so it's like a PC game.
1220428	1220628	Yeah.
1220648	1221849	Because I hear cartoon, I think of Wii.
1222893	1228075	But I think that I had seen a little bit of it and it looks like it might be a little bit fun.
1228775	1233237	So I thought that, especially anything that's free, I thought that people would be into it.
1235818	1236558	So May 6th.
1237218	1238359	Beta!
1239559	1239939	Alright.
1240340	1242860	Hey, I like beta and I like free games even more.
1242881	1243701	Beta Max!
1244601	1248563	Another EA game that's getting a, well not really a beta, but a demo.
1248883	1249523	A VHS?
1250143	1251244	No, not a VHS.
1251404	1251944	A Laserdisc?
1252719	1255582	Spore Creature Creator and Demo
1270560	1273182	I believe there's like a SimCity pack or Sims pack coming out.
1274083	1281849	That'll be a part of that, as well as, well, if you don't want to purchase it as part of that, you can also get the, I guess, demo for $9.99.
1282630	1287834	And what the Creature Creator will allow you to do is create creatures, obviously.
1288234	1291897	You can export those creatures to wallpapers and stuff like that.
1292417	1296660	So, plus, I guess the creatures can be used in the full game when that actually finally comes out.
1297681	1298662	You know what's kind of sad?
1298682	1298762	What?
1299790	1301071	I, like, forgot about Spore.
1301892	1305815	Remember I was so hyped about this game after we saw that one demo at E3 in, like, what, 2005?
1306396	1309178	I was, like, so hyped up for Spore, right?
1309499	1310600	I kind of forgot about Spore.
1310880	1313722	They might as well just rename this game Spore Chinese Democracy.
1313782	1315364	It's the next PC game I'm gonna buy.
1315704	1324532	I mean... Because I don't really... Well, the last game I bought, and I didn't really technically buy it because I got it for free, was Crysis.
1325052	1326073	It came with my graphics card.
1326574	1326694	So...
1327110	1327870	DarkSakura.com
1356690	1358111	Ragnarok 2, maybe.
1358771	1360172	So your games have to come from Korea.
1360492	1363073	Yeah, Korea.
1363153	1371556	I wouldn't mind having an updated Sonic R. Rock Band is a game we all own and love and play on the internet.
1371596	1373437	I was actually playing a little bit of Rock Band this week.
1373477	1377679	I was playing with our webmaster VXJasonXV and Raichan.
1378399	1381361	I was playing with them and sadly, Xbox, well...
1382261	1383182	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1407441	1409022	which are from Chico, California.
1409202	1410543	I know that because I used to live there.
1410683	1413645	So I think it's kind of funny that now they're having all this success through a video game.
1413665	1417748	But there you have Red Tandy and Time Sick Son of a Grizzly Bear from the Mother Hipps.
1417768	1420049	I wonder if they still play at Brickworks.
1420109	1420450	I don't know.
1420750	1421750	But that is coming.
1422891	1424633	at some point to Rock Band.
1424673	1426034	That would be next Tuesday, actually.
1427095	1428756	But the Smashing Pumpkins, you know them.
1428816	1429997	They have a song already in the game.
1430017	1431619	They have, what, Cherub Rock is in the game.
1431919	1435342	And now you can download Zero, which has some pretty awesome guitar.
1435943	1436903	Remember that song, Zero?
1437824	1440166	Although, props to you if you can sing like Billy Corgan.
1440847	1441007	No.
1441107	1443069	Because he's got something going on.
1444130	1446372	It's sad when a man can sing higher than me.
1446692	1448653	Billy Corgan is sadly not David Cook, is he?
1448874	1448994	No.
1449254	1449374	No.
1449834	1450095	All right.
1451383	1452905	Let's get to the mailbag.
1452985	1454987	Every week we encourage you guys to send us some emails.
1455067	1457309	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to do it.
1457609	1463595	DarkSakura will dive into the email bag every week, but she wears plastic gloves when she does it because she doesn't want anthrax poisoning.
1464016	1465898	Anthrax was an 80s band, not a poison.
1468123	1470324	Alright, so here it is, our mailbag segment.
1471005	1472345	DarkSakura, read some emails.
1472806	1476007	Crap, crap, crap, crap done.
1476227	1476648	No, I'm kidding.
1476868	1478168	We just got a lot of crap this week?
1478469	1482431	No, although some underage girl wanted to show me her private pictures.
1482951	1484032	Oh, damn that spam.
1484512	1484772	I know.
1484812	1485893	That's supposed to be coming to me.
1486373	1491256	No, I'm not going to say it.
1491516	1491776	Anyway.
1493157	1494538	Hi, guys!
1494818	1501523	On the show before last, Rob said Live365, idiots, charged him after he sent two emails saying he quit.
1502183	1505025	He said he would give us an update on it last week and never did.
1505346	1507327	So my question is, what's going on with that?
1507927	1511930	Also, I have been listening since episode 150 and I still don't know why Loki hates Tingle.
1512271	1512671	P.S.
1512811	1513752	I attached a picture.
1513892	1514472	I was bored.
1514932	1515513	Misspelled.
1516714	1517274	Who's it from?
1517995	1521097	Oh, it's a little picture of Tingle with Loki's face on it and it says Loki.
1523209	1524693	How wonderful.
1525434	1527378	And that's from Eichen House Cheeseburger.
1527970	1528731	I can ask Cheeseburger.
1529151	1529491	Thank you.
1529511	1532654	I did forget to give the Live 365 update because it's kind of funny what happened.
1532674	1541162	You might remember I was really pissed because they charged my credit card, and it was a little unfair of me to not give the follow-up, so I apologize to them.
1541482	1547127	But strangely enough, that next Monday, mysteriously, with no email, well, no, I did get an email.
1547167	1554374	I got a little email in my inbox that says, Rob, we have processed the cancellation, and they refunded my credit card, the entire money.
1557318	1558759	They did not end up stealing the money for me.
1558779	1561842	It was only out of my bank account for a couple of days.
1562002	1563003	They borrowed it for a couple of days.
1563023	1565365	They poked it and did experiments.
1565666	1569930	The strange thing is we got a little bit of kickback from our VIP listenership.
1569950	1572732	The more VIPs that we had listening to us on Live 365, we got some kickback.
1572752	1574474	But honestly, guys, it was nothing.
1574554	1577717	I think we got like $1.37 from the month of May.
1578277	1579718	No, I'm sorry, month of March.
1581220	1584742	So I actually got refunded that $1.37 back as well.
1584882	1591728	So I actually did get a little bit of interest, I guess you could say, thanks to our VIP listeners, who I do feel bad for that we're not on Live 365 anymore.
1591868	1593889	But all games, it's where it's at, yo.
1594710	1595310	It's where it's at.
1597152	1597652	Live in the now.
1598432	1604357	Also, Sauce says that Poison was also an 80s band, Rob.
1605097	1605537	That is true.
1606058	1608099	Anthrax is poison and poison was also an 80s band.
1608339	1608780	That's crazy.
1608820	1610541	Dark Titsuya said the exact same thing in chat.
1611141	1611982	Great minds think alike.
1612002	1612663	That's kind of freaky.
1613243	1614644	I like what my husband says.
1615184	1616205	Great minds think like us.
1616785	1618607	Loki, describe your hatred of Tingle.
1618647	1620028	Why is it you hate Tingle so damn much?
1620828	1622109	I think he's a stupid character.
1622350	1622770	That's all.
1623851	1624471	He was annoying.
1624511	1626392	He was annoying in Wind Waker.
1627974	1630936	This fascination with everybody for me to do Tingle's voice.
1631216	1631616	I don't know.
1631676	1632457	It's just retarded.
1632995	1633476	I did it one night, yes.
1633496	1635037	Because people don't know when to let a joke go.
1635077	1636279	This email is from someone in Australia, I believe.
1651152	1652312	So... Crikey!
1652913	1653293	Hi!
1654213	1657354	I've been listening for the past six months on podcasts and have been enjoying it.
1657734	1663095	It breaks up the ride to and from work so I'm not bored just looking at the window seeing the same thing every day.
1663696	1666616	I can't listen live as it's in the middle of Monday and I'm at work.
1667417	1669377	Only have been live once.
1669877	1671518	The changeover to all games has been good.
1671578	1674619	I've noticed the upgrade in audio from the first second.
1674979	1676399	Glad to see you've left dead 365.
1679747	1683668	I actually do want to point out the change in audio has nothing to do with our all-games move.
1683708	1685589	The live change in audio, yes.
1686029	1697313	The podcast change in audio was just a decision that we just did, we went through with, and that is that we used to be encoded in 56k stereo, but honestly, how much music have we been playing on this show?
1697373	1697793	Not a lot.
1697833	1704975	So we downgrade, we actually downgraded to mono, but we went to 64k mono, and that, there's a lot of difference there in the sound quality.
1705276	1706136	So it sounds really good.
1707902	1713224	I've been playing Mario Kart Wii quite a bit over the past few months and I found out something that Rob won't like too much.
1713484	1717366	Sorry to tell you, Rob, but Toadette is an unlockable character on Mario Kart Wii.
1719667	1721368	Thanks for everything and keep up the good work.
1721468	1722309	Long live the ferret.
1722329	1728512	That's the one I was trying to get to.
1729072	1731453	And this email is also sponsored by the Olive Garden.
1731533	1734135	Unfortunately, no never-ending breadsticks here in Australia.
1734315	1734535	What? !
1736935	1738236	You need to start a riot.
1740078	1743300	Bobby Blackwolf's in chat, our old buddy who airs an hour before us.
1743360	1745422	He is actually taking credit for the sound upgrade.
1745462	1748505	He says, no, actually, all games is responsible for this change, too.
1748585	1749285	Don't believe Rob.
1749345	1753028	We were like, you can't come unless you're in 64K mono.
1753068	1753429	It's true.
1754309	1754510	Rob.
1755270	1755450	What?
1755911	1756091	Rob.
1756351	1756511	What?
1756631	1757492	Rob.
1757552	1757792	What?
1758633	1760414	On May 1st, let's go to Olive Garden.
1761155	1761535	I can't.
1762156	1764097	I'm still on the low-fat diet until at least...
1765424	1765684	Really?
1766064	1766245	Yes!
1766285	1767565	Alright, then we can go on May 1st.
1768446	1773089	I will personally look over their menu and pick out the crap that is low-fat.
1773109	1774510	You can get a diet menu anywhere.
1774710	1775390	That's what I've learned.
1775470	1777251	I've been in Vegas on May 1st.
1778372	1780193	Alright, here we go with the Food Network again.
1780253	1781374	But here's a quick thing.
1781414	1786897	If the listeners that have been listening for a couple months know that I have issues in my pancreas, I'm on a very strict low-fat diet because of it.
1787177	1788038	I should put that in my cage.
1788098	1789378	Until at least May 9th.
1789779	1790859	Here's the thing is that...
1793355	1802901	Part of the thing I've learned, like I went to Ruby Tuesdays this week with some of my co-workers that were visiting from LA, and they were getting the spinach dip and the avocado dip, and they were like, mmm, this is so good.
1802981	1803741	I'm so sorry, Rob.
1803781	1804742	I'm so sorry you can't eat this.
1805162	1806843	So I learned that they have a diet menu.
1806863	1808284	You know what I ate at Ruby Tuesdays?
1808304	1808885	Nice little fat.
1809285	1812387	I ate an unflavored piece of cooked chicken and broccoli.
1812927	1813607	That was my dinner.
1814788	1815649	Whoop-de-hoo!
1817590	1817810	Well...
1819913	1829056	I think that also part of... I think that, you know, possibly the... You didn't ask if it's all the fats or if it's just saturated.
1829317	1830097	Saturates.
1830257	1830797	It's all fat.
1830977	1831457	It's any fat.
1831857	1832478	Oh, man.
1832518	1833178	I can't have fat.
1833238	1833838	I can't have caffeine.
1833858	1834458	I can't have carbonation.
1834478	1835399	You can't digest vitamin E now.
1835619	1836179	It's horrible.
1836919	1838380	You cannot digest vitamin E.
1839125	1842167	May 5th marks one month since I got out of the hospital, but here's the thing.
1842628	1851915	I had Thai food last night in San Francisco that I thought was going to be healthy for me, and I think I overindulged a little bit because my chest was hurting last night, and that's not a good sign.
1852976	1853656	I'm really worried.
1853676	1854577	I don't want to have this forever.
1854917	1856338	Alright, OL Foodio is over.
1856398	1857879	Let's get back to the email.
1858480	1858940	Orange Lounge Foodio.
1861952	1862192	Okay.
1862452	1863333	Hey, OLR.
1863953	1868056	First off, a big F you to Nintendo for giving a mandatory update with Super Smash Bros.
1868096	1871198	Brawl, so now I permanently have Photo Channel 1.1.
1872078	1880203	This means I need to make M4A files to listen to music on Photo Channel, which means I'll have to delete my MP3 files for one of my favorite racing games, Excite Truck.
1880363	1882785	Loki, I love the game as much as you do You Are Not Alone.
1883666	1889509	Next, would you buy anything with the word strip before the title if it were on Xbox Live Arcade?
1890330	1890590	Yes.
1890610	1890930	Yes.
1892409	1893269	What if it's strip mine?
1895350	1896451	That's what I keep thinking of.
1896511	1899432	What if it's, you know, strip racing?
1900133	1900853	Or strip paint.
1901633	1904515	You know, where you go to the wall and put turpentine and shit.
1905976	1909637	Third, are you looking forward to any WiiWare games when the service comes out next week?
1910638	1919562	I actually like Defend Your Castle way more than I ought to, so I'll probably buy Defend Your Castle on the Wii, because that game is so much freaking hilarity on the PC.
1919602	1920783	And yeah, I know it's been out for years.
1921974	1923357	That's what I want.
1923377	1923497	Oh, man.
1931904	1932264	Let's see.
1932284	1939966	The chat room wants to let our emailer know Blackwolf is saying he can just delete the 1.1 channel and Actdeft is going to post a link in chat.
1939986	1942226	There is a way you can downgrade the photo channel from 1.1.
1943087	1945367	You can get rid of that if you want to go back to the old one.
1946247	1948868	Probably you can Google it since you're not a live listener, it sounds like.
1948888	1950568	Was this the same guy from Australia?
1950948	1952629	No, this is Katamari's Forever.
1952809	1955329	Oh, well shit, Katamari's Forever I think is in chat right now.
1956110	1956650	Or did they leave?
1957510	1958150	Oh, I think they left.
1959141	1960884	Well, poor thing, because they're about to get a link in chat.
1961044	1963928	But if they happen to be listening to the podcast, I'm sure it's out there somewhere.
1964369	1965190	Shoot us a message.
1965571	1966112	We'll find it.
1966252	1974004	Actdeft is posting a link from Joystick, the blog with a joystick with a Q. It was posted on December 13th of last year, if you want to go find it.
1977824	1980547	Lastly, I recently bought Night's Journey of Dreams.
1980627	1986093	It's a cool and very cute game, but it suffers from simplicity.
1986534	1990538	However, the voice acting is top-notch, and it sort of alludes to Eternity's Child.
1990678	1994883	I hope to see you at the Olive Garden when the Endless Pasta deal comes back.
1996440	2000782	and the Knights has always been simplistic in play.
2000882	2010046	However, having upgraded, you know, better voice acting is really good because the Saturn version is like, and Claris decided that she was going to go out.
2010086	2015028	It's like they took one of their secretaries who just happened to speak English and say, here, do this.
2015969	2016429	Okay.
2016889	2019190	And yes, it had the same bad voice acting in Japan.
2019290	2021071	Sadly, that's probably how it happened.
2022150	2022932	Oh yeah, I went and found it.
2023353	2023713	P.S.
2024475	2026018	Where did DarkSakura get the ferret?
2026580	2029285	I haven't listened for that long, and I'd like to know of its origins.
2029346	2029827	Thanks again.
2030167	2032472	It's not my ferret, but I have adopted it as my baby.
2033354	2039558	I want to say this week on the Wikia, I posted a huge... I went to the Wikia to clear up two questions that were being asked to me.
2039658	2040578	One of them was the ferret.
2040939	2045781	No, the ferret article was wrong, so I went and posted a big old thing in the talk section, so you can go read that.
2046762	2049684	And also on the Wikia, how OLR got its name.
2050044	2056148	DarkTetsuya wanted me to post a thing about that, so I posted a big old thing on that, including why we named it that, and so on and so on.
2060138	2062240	Actdeft is also pointing a step-by-step.
2062280	2065703	He actually went and got a bullet point list of how you downgrade the photo channel.
2065723	2066143	So here it is.
2066463	2078374	From the main menu, go into the Wii button, select Data Management, select Channels, then select Photo Channel 1.1, confirm you want to delete it.
2078694	2080636	Photo Channel 1.0 will return.
2080916	2081376	There you have it.
2082798	2083258	Stuff.
2084359	2085100	A long email.
2085865	2086205	Oh lord.
2086245	2086905	Dun dun dun.
2086945	2087245	From who?
2087706	2089006	Guess who it's from.
2089146	2089506	From who?
2090387	2092127	It is from Rolf Steel UT.
2092287	2093468	He must be listening tonight.
2093528	2095068	He must have heard the thing earlier, didn't he?
2095848	2096228	I don't know.
2097089	2097389	Alright.
2100470	2101530	Well, read however much you want to.
2102130	2103131	Hey guys!
2103831	2107152	Hi, I'm a girl, so you should clarify too.
2109253	2110153	Hey guys and girl.
2110717	2111738	Hi, baby.
2112299	2112519	Anyway.
2114462	2115764	You really wanted him to start emailing?
2115784	2116384	Hey, baby.
2117105	2117265	No.
2117846	2118848	I was just being silly.
2119508	2122332	Rob, the heat in here is giving me a freaking migraine.
2122612	2124234	Look, you're sitting right by the fan.
2124274	2124915	I don't know what to tell you.
2124975	2125416	It doesn't matter.
2125456	2126217	I still have a migraine.
2126434	2127614	And the box fan is broke.
2127734	2128274	Alright, come on.
2128434	2128894	Read the email.
2128934	2129795	He broke the box.
2130955	2134815	Just because I can't get on the chat anymore doesn't mean I can't participate.
2134915	2136376	Dude, unban him, okay?
2137416	2140036	My official decree is to freaking unban him.
2140196	2140817	So do it.
2141917	2142417	Oh, snap.
2142957	2143377	Now.
2144157	2145137	Alright, there you have it.
2145777	2152038	I'd probably say more things that DMN and other game pirates don't like in these emails, but what are they gonna do?
2152178	2152599	Ban me?
2154639	2154739	Ugh.
2157054	2163881	Anyway, I wanted to start by talking about light gun games on consoles, particularly games that use limited continues.
2164281	2170648	The problem with console ports of arcade shooters is that, by and large, they're very vanilla ports without much consideration for the home consoles.
2171369	2179577	Obviously, you need to get the arcade mode in there, give people the option of free play, but in order to give a balanced experience, it feels like it's...
2182443	2183044	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2210327	2213732	have been released recently to show a way for console light gun games to work.
2214052	2217657	First, we have time crises for complete mission mode.
2218618	2225468	In between the FPS stages, players will play through the arcade stages, but there is a difference in how they work versus the arcade mode.
2226048	2230089	The player starts each stage with four units of life regardless of their health at the end of the previous stage.
2230570	2233090	Upon death, the stage starts at the very beginning.
2233471	2235991	They can, however, retry as many times as they like.
2236372	2240993	This makes the game challenging without being a cheap exercise in credit draining.
2241713	2243974	Another game is Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles.
2244334	2251857	This game has a checkpoint at the center of the stage and at the final boss, and items found in the game can be used immediately or stored for later use.
2252877	2258724	One can only hope that more light gun games will provide more robust experiences.
2258764	2259645	Did he use robust?
2261827	2265351	Because just the arcade game isn't enough.
2265711	2267453	Remember, you can't spell robust without Rob.
2268094	2268534	Or bust.
2270376	2271317	Like robo-bust.
2272639	2273279	More email.
2273480	2273980	More email!
2274200	2274461	Fine!
2275794	2281879	Next, I saw something on Kotaku regarding the obscene amount of time it takes to quit the PC versions of Assassin's Creed.
2282239	2284961	It took a full minute to quit the game using the in-game menus.
2285281	2300573	Granted, you can control alt delete and quit that way, but seeing just how asinine the in-game quit ordeal is really cast doubt over Ubi's willingness to cater to the PC crowd, especially with the continued downfall of the PC as a mainstream gaming platform, i.e.
2300633	2303235	retail games and not ad-supported casual stuff.
2304736	2315562	and it's at kotaku.com slash 384339 slash assassins-creed-i-can't-quit-you I think that's pretty freaking funny.
2316750	2324935	Next, I have to talk about the Perfect 10 review IGN gave GTA 4, which was coincidentally an exclusive first review.
2325975	2330878	First off, one has to question the ethical integrity of an exclusive review.
2331839	2334460	We don't hear about exclusive music or movie previews.
2334880	2335801	It just doesn't happen.
2336181	2336381	Why?
2336421	2342005	Because the music and movie reviews tend to have more integrity than much of the gaming enthusiast media.
2343163	2355291	Indeed, I've never seen an exclusive review that wasn't a glowing puff piece for the game in question.
2355751	2364697	And the reviewer in this case made it obvious with hyperbole like calling it the best game in a decade and proclaiming it to be perfect.
2366115	2371238	I can imagine the guy writing the review on his knees while his mouth was otherwise occupied.
2371978	2391789	Considering Loki's criticism of the soundtrack, Jamie's complete disinterest in the boring monotony, and both Loki and Rob saying that the cheats are what make GTA fun, it really looks like Rockstar is buying reviews, or at least like many reviewers are mystified by the uber-popular franchise and not wanting to believe they're even the slightest thing wrong with it.
2393389	2393690	You know what?
2393710	2394610	I just want to jump in here.
2394750	2403654	I actually really agree with what he's saying here because I think it is absolute bullshit that IGN gets this exclusive review and coincidentally it gets a 10 out of 10.
2404234	2412878	Now, I think we all knew Grand Theft Auto was going to get stellar reviews across the board, but quite frankly, IGN's word is tarnished, period, from this.
2413920	2414861	Thanks for watching!
2432273	2432613	I don't know.
2432993	2435954	The whole rating system is kind of skewed anyways.
2436054	2439935	And really what you need to do is just ignore the ratings and just read what they write.
2439975	2444076	Because they'll explain in the review that it's not perfect and that there's issues and stuff.
2444416	2445437	And that's really what you need to take.
2445457	2447797	You don't buy your game based off of a number review.
2447978	2448878	It's just like, you know...
2450038	2457421	If you scored a B on a test or something, what's more important, the fact that you scored a B or why you scored a B on the test?
2457721	2462143	That's what's more important, I would think, to an individual.
2462163	2464644	And the other thing, too, is a lot of people are skewed.
2464665	2467026	There's a lot of Grand Theft Auto fanboys out there.
2467886	2473568	I'll be first to say I love the game, and I absolutely think it's not perfect, but it's...
2475839	2476279	What do you expect?
2476379	2483121	It's basically as much of a jump from Grand Theft Auto 3 to 4 as it was from 2 to 3.
2484162	2485122	And that was pretty big.
2486642	2487002	It's great.
2487183	2488083	It's where it needs to go.
2488163	2488863	But you know what?
2488923	2495265	When they do come out with the next Vice City or whatever that is using the same engine, it's going to be that much better.
2495385	2496625	So, I don't know.
2497746	2498106	But yeah.
2498406	2500067	Exclusive anything's retarded.
2500287	2501347	There was more to that paragraph.
2503655	2515689	The lack of balls in mainstream gaming media is frighteningly familiar to anyone who remembers the gaming industry crash of 1983 when people stopped buying video games in general because even shitty games were getting glowing reviews.
2516290	2523218	Hopefully the growth of independent media such as All Games Radio will stem the tide of consumer distrust before the industry explodes.
2524739	2537923	Lastly, while the Nintendo Wii is still selling like crazy, attach rates are still lower than either other console, and third parties are increasingly looking at the Wii as nothing more than a disposable toy.
2538364	2546406	GameStop can't keep Wiis in stock but have huge piles of accessories, and the only consistent sellers are Wii Play and Nintendo mascot games.
2546926	2548807	Nintendo can make all the money they want,
2549327	2554729	I do agree that they haven't really expanded much beyond... I mean, because they were trying to get out of the whole rut that, you know, the GameCube is just a game for kids.
2554749	2557049	Well, the fact that they're releasing kid games, you know, all across... And I...
2579201	2582169	Okay, so they released Metroid Prime 3, but big deal.
2582529	2585798	One game out of, you know, I don't know how many they've made.
2586199	2587121	That doesn't really count.
2589304	2597848	And yeah, they are targeting, you know, the casual player and stuff with these, you know, like Wii Fit and, you know, just the Wii console and Wii Sports and everything.
2597908	2601489	And so, yeah, there's a lot of people that will buy it just for Wii Sports and that's it.
2601909	2608972	And they've sold, you know, they profited from that maybe about $10, you know, because they're probably making some money off each console, but that's it.
2609513	2614895	And, you know, then they're getting people to buy accessories and stuff and there's, you know, a lot of markup there too, so...
2616201	2616881	It's just retarded.
2617101	2637271	I think it's important to remember, not that I'm trying to make excuses for the Wii, because the Wii certainly has its shortcomings, especially as we've kind of moved on a year past its launch and so on, or almost two years getting there, is that the Wii doesn't lose money with every sale, whereas PlayStation 3 loses quite a bit of money, and Xbox 360 I think now about breaks even, but when it was first out, it was losing money too.
2637671	2640032	So they have to sell more games to kind of make a profit.
2640512	2643493	But Nintendo Wii, they're profiting right out the gate.
2643653	2647654	So kind of like Loki says, you just buy it for Wii Sports, there's still a profit to be made.
2648014	2659658	But I think as long as Nintendo puts out those one, two games a year that you just have to freaking have, the soccer moms, and I think Wii Fit is this year's, it's still going to be a big deal.
2662578	2665520	But again, it's just a different audience than the hardcore gamer.
2666321	2670884	So if Nintendo wants to appeal to the hardcore gamer, I guess we get Metroid Prime 3.
2671385	2672405	Mario Kart's not bad.
2673506	2674947	There's some of those games.
2675588	2679531	Here's my problem with Nintendo is I don't think they get the market still.
2679671	2689538	Even though they may... In theory, tapping parts of the market that haven't been tapped before, like the casual gamer and stuff...
2691158	2695080	Maybe you shouldn't be tapping that market because it's not profitable for you.
2695140	2698221	You're selling tons of consoles, but these people aren't buying games.
2698461	2700002	It's also the same problem with Sony.
2700062	2703664	You're selling a PlayStation 3 as a Blu-ray player.
2703784	2705744	Well, these people may not buy games either.
2706145	2711267	So now you're losing money on that sale, but you're not necessarily making it up in Blu-ray sales.
2711607	2714170	Keep in mind also, Nintendo is a Japanese company.
2714230	2715891	Microsoft is an American company.
2715931	2724600	And while, yes, Sony is a Japanese company as well, you kind of get the feeling that there's a little bit of tug of war going on between their American and Japanese arms as to, you know, who's controlling the PlayStation 3.
2725120	2725621	You know what I mean?
2726161	2726361	So...
2727515	2733937	It's something else to consider as well, because definitely you have a vastly different audience when you talk about the Japanese gaming audience and the American gaming audience.
2733977	2736377	Just look at any top ten chart from a week, and there you have it.
2736697	2744879	And, I mean, the same, I guess, could be said for the DS, because the Nintendo-made games tend to sell very well, and it's starting to come around for third-party stuff.
2745139	2751681	And I think it's going to come around eventually for the Wii as well, because, I mean, the Wii's only been out for, you know, not that long, so...
2753004	2761133	I mean, sure, there's a ton of crappy ports, just like there was a ton of crappy Xbox ports for the Xbox 360 when it first came out.
2761713	2766638	And there was a ton of crappy PlayStation 1 ports for the PlayStation 2 when it first came out.
2767099	2771223	But Fantavision... Fantavision was fun.
2771384	2772425	I liked Fantavision.
2773165	2773526	I don't know.
2774485	2777026	But, you know, stuff will get better.
2777066	2782408	And people, unfortunately, you know, people understand that there are shovelware games out there.
2782528	2783169	And you know what?
2783229	2784869	The best thing you can do is just not buy them.
2785009	2788191	You know, granted, there are stupid people that will buy them, but that's fine.
2788231	2788991	That's who they're catered to.
2789011	2791792	There will always be the Walmart crowd that buys them because they're cheap.
2792052	2792613	But that's fine.
2793053	2794213	Those companies are there.
2794574	2802057	You know, it's pretty funny, though, because we had some of the publishers out, and there were some publishers that deal in specifically...
2802937	2830102	I want to say it was Destiny but I'm not sure but they're a company that dealt with like really small games that you know didn't really do that well and they understand where their market is they understand that they're not trying to compete with like Grand Theft Auto they're competing you know they're basically just putting them out there because they sell and that's it so you know they understand that their games aren't that quality but they accept them for what they are so it's just people that are dumb and buy them
2830507	2831471	Alright, let's move on.
2831511	2832434	That was the end of the email.
2832474	2833617	Are there any more emails?
2834440	2835042	No, no, no.
2835102	2835624	There were two more.
2836266	2836446	Okay.
2837403	2838083	Hey, OLR.
2838123	2839404	Hope Sky and the Ferret are okay.
2839904	2846907	I just thought I'd say that since I started to listen to OLR episode 245, the show has changed so much.
2846927	2849288	New cam, new studio, and the all games move.
2849748	2851189	OLR is just getting bigger and better.
2851269	2851729	Congrats.
2852529	2861273	I should be live for once as I live in the UK, so keep an eye out as it won't happen again for a while.
2861313	2863273	That's from Lycan that's in the chat room right now.
2863413	2864154	They are in chat.
2864554	2864834	Awesome.
2865402	2866363	Last email!
2866543	2869867	I just wanted to say, that person did kind of put it into perspective.
2869887	2873371	There has been a lot of changes to the show just in the past year, so it's pretty exciting.
2874892	2875613	Soon the world.
2878256	2879077	Last email.
2879718	2880659	Dun dun dun.
2881556	2882377	Hi, OLR.
2883158	2886082	I have been really bored because I forced myself to stop Crysis.
2887083	2890969	I've been playing other games right now, like Ragnarok 2, but I think it hates Vista.
2891069	2891670	What doesn't?
2892330	2895735	So it gives me a BSOD, to translate, a blue screen of death.
2926272	2926792	Diz were good.
2927833	2930074	12 was great.
2930414	2933415	Well, you know, I played 12 and I did not like the battle system at all.
2933515	2936316	There's people up and down screaming, you gotta get Persona 3.
2936416	2937657	Yeah, Persona 3.
2938777	2942279	Or, uh... Disgaea, if you like tactical games.
2942319	2942479	What was...
2945874	2955200	I'm trying to think of what the... It's not really an RPG, but the Fatal Frame games were getting some... have a little bit of a fan following behind them, too.
2956161	2958882	This is from Sakura Max, Dragging Misery Into My Life.
2960103	2963646	I hope all the idiots who exist in my life would just go away.
2963766	2965207	Okay, I'm not going to read the rest of that.
2965227	2965567	That's emo.
2965627	2965947	P.S.
2966007	2966868	Strip Lounge Radio.
2967608	2968048	P.S.S.
2968128	2968929	Orange Lounge Radio.
2969029	2969870	It's better than Crisis.
2971310	2971611	Indeed.
2971891	2972731	It is better than Crisis.
2974012	2974933	Now we're done with emails.
2977540	2977780	Yar.
2978060	2978400	Yar.
2979240	2979340	Oh.
2981181	2983861	I got one more mention from RawSteelUT.
2984761	2985621	Oh, how long is it?
2985921	2986262	Not long.
2986622	2987122	Alright, hurry.
2987742	2991702	Sorry guys, but with my banning from chat, I can't respond fast to the topics I like.
2992183	2993163	Just some quick things though.
2993223	2997563	In the US, fansubbing is still illegal as it violates the original rights holders.
2997623	2999744	In this case, Japanese anime makers.
3000124	3005865	Companies like Media Factory Incorporated have sent cease and desist orders to torrent sites carrying fansubs of their anime.
3006445	3024122	and we've seen an increase in recent years of pre-licensed anime such as Ghost of the Shell Standalone Complex and some cases even funded in part by US companies like ADV and Manga Entertainment Japanese companies are obviously discontent with fansubbers as they devalue a license and are also available for Japanese users the internet being what it is
3025443	3032190	JSRAC is a company formed by such anime companies and have frequently had problems with YouTube over the fans of content in their service.
3032991	3040778	As for the sequel to Rival Schools, while it is still called Project Justice Rival Schools 2 in Latin American Europe, the subtitle Rival Schools 2 was removed from the American, I knew that.
3041819	3047744	Presumably not to cause controversy two years after the Columbine Massacre in Japan, it was referred to as Moru Justice Gakuen, which is what I said.
3048526	3055244	and that's the name I still mostly refer to it by because I had the Japanese version for a long long time so yeah
3056979	3062123	If you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Meanwhile, more gaming news!
3062623	3065505	Yes, there's going to be a brand new game.
3065605	3066986	Actually, this looks pretty awesome.
3067066	3070148	I've got one on order for myself and I'm not really into racing games.
3071329	3074771	Grid, the brand new game from Codemasters.
3074811	3079614	You may remember them doing Dirt, which is a pretty well-accepted game.
3080215	3084958	This time, it's going to be all street racing, well, street circuits and that kind of stuff.
3086619	3096761	It is pretty cool though, they're going to have integration with eBay Motors, so you can actually, I guess, sell vehicles that you have created in-game through eBay.
3098410	3101851	I don't know how that's actually going to work, though, if you're going to have to pay real money for it.
3102712	3107854	It says, well, it's going to allow players to buy and sell in-game vehicles in a realistic setting.
3108914	3116097	And it says also they're going to have different eBay-sponsored races, like the eBay Motor Muscle Series.
3118138	3124481	They're going to have, let's see, some other concept cars and stuff like that with eBay stuff plastered all over it.
3125811	3126971	I could find out.
3146201	3146882	Thanks for watching!
3159551	3161093	Ticket Redemption Games and Illegal Gambling
3179455	3180776	But it's not what you think.
3181237	3181777	Here's the thing.
3182318	3185020	The sponsor of the bill, he calls it the Chuck E. Cheese Bill.
3185561	3192026	And what it is is that right now, a game like skee-ball or a type of video game, it might violate the law.
3192446	3199192	However, what he wants to do is he actually wants to clearly state that these games do not violate the gambling law, that they're okay.
3199653	3203276	So it's actually, you know, usually when we talk about, you know,
3203976	3205737	Game-related bills going into effect.
3222526	3234871	That doesn't change the fact, though, that these games at Chuck E. Cheese is one thing, but these games having taken over my favorite arcades of yesteryear are another, and it kind of ticks me off.
3234951	3245756	I don't know about you guys, but I'm a little bit pissed off that Ticket Redemption games have overtaken arcades I used to know and love and shut other ones out of business, and hence that's why I think it's time to do the FUs of the week.
3262092	3280126	Um, my, uh, FU is, uh, to these stupid people, and I know I always do talk about, you know, traffic and stupid people driving, but this couple in a big mini, it's not really mini, it's just a van.
3281041	3283062	We're turning around where you cannot do a U-turn.
3283703	3286404	And so turned into the next street and did a wide loop.
3286485	3290267	So I was like, fuck you, you have to wait since they're technically in a right-hand turning lane now.
3290667	3293009	And I went and honked at them quite loudly.
3293109	3294410	Stupid bitch.
3294950	3297352	And also, F you to the heat.
3298672	3302835	I mean, it's not very hot right now and it was really nice outside, but the sun specifically.
3303636	3304696	F you, sun!
3304716	3307478	You need to get a really big rock and throw it at the sun.
3307498	3310480	A little bit of Tampa.
3311198	3311458	No!
3312399	3312859	Or a burn.
3313119	3313439	Loki.
3314860	3318142	I don't know, I don't have any FUs this week.
3320004	3322765	I guess... Okay, I got one.
3323486	3328109	FU to Burger King for coming out with the Deluxe Steakhouse Burger.
3328549	3335013	Because I understand, as cool of an idea as it sounds like on paper, it really is not a very good burger.
3335173	3336674	I mean, it's got, what...
3337096	3339138	You know, steak, like onions.
3339378	3344463	But where they go wrong with it is that it has mashed potatoes on the burger.
3345584	3345665	Ew.
3345725	3347486	We used to do that in elementary school.
3347506	3348968	That sounds nasty.
3349508	3350129	I tried it.
3350249	3351230	It wasn't very good.
3351290	3352832	But the Steakhouse Burger itself is good.
3352852	3354073	Just don't go deluxe.
3354553	3356435	Or if you do, minus mashed potatoes.
3356756	3359018	It sounds more like a shepherd's pie burger.
3360623	3362124	If you've got this beef in there, you
3386078	3389163	Misty, by the way, is in chat and she's a BK expert of sorts.
3389303	3390585	She says, I agree with that.
3390865	3392027	Hey, I like the potatoes.
3392087	3393590	It's the meat that's fucking nasty.
3395533	3396935	No, the meat's not bad.
3397335	3398036	Try McDonald's.
3398056	3398557	That shit's horrible.
3398777	3400841	Here we go again with Orange Lounge Foodio.
3403659	3407520	My FU of the week goes to my pancreas, again, for giving me problems the past few days.
3407860	3410621	Specifically the cysts that I believe burst on my pancreas.
3411001	3413282	Ew, I know, but think how it feels.
3413942	3416883	Just a couple days ago, which caused me to have a lot of pain.
3417643	3418724	And I'm still in pain today.
3418744	3420564	It feels like there's a hole in my pancreas.
3420624	3421144	It hurts.
3421244	3421665	I hate it.
3422325	3422825	And, um...
3423585	3425266	F you to drama in general.
3425286	3427887	I'm not talking about any chat room drama that's going on or whatever.
3427907	3431589	I'm talking about drama in my personal life, because I had a lot of drama.
3431670	3433611	I had epic drama yesterday.
3433891	3438233	Epic, with a capital E-P-I-C, all caps, epic drama yesterday.
3438673	3439354	It was great.
3442455	3443656	And by great, I mean shitty.
3444476	3444737	Alright.
3446838	3447998	There you have it, your FUs of the week.
3448439	3449559	Let's get back to some gaming news.
3452241	3452761	Yes, we must.
3455181	3455381	Okay.
3455981	3456441	Guess what?
3457521	3459522	Arby's bought out Wendy's for real?
3459542	3459882	They did?
3461183	3464544	How did Arby's buy... Here we go back to Orange Lounge Radio Foodio.
3465564	3467265	Arby's bought... Wouldn't it be the other way around?
3467285	3468245	I thought Wendy's was number three.
3468285	3469446	Shouldn't Wendy's buy Arby's?
3471066	3472267	Arby's is nastified.
3473707	3476168	Except their hash brown things are really good to dip in the cheese.
3477929	3478789	So guess what?
3479570	3479790	What?
3480150	3480590	Home.
3481010	3482451	Oh, they're trying to buy Wendy's.
3482671	3482891	Sorry.
3483908	3484408	Yes, home.
3484488	3484868	I'm in it.
3485829	3490450	The open beta is going to be in fall 2008.
3492431	3494152	So the closed beta has been extended.
3496193	3502935	However, Sony is going to be inviting more people to join, so maybe they'll actually update stuff in it like they said they were.
3502995	3507557	How about they invite everyone to join and just release it?
3509208	3533818	because I think they're still hashing out stuff and according to some of the updates there haven't really been updates they've just been sort of sitting there going la la la this takes me back to what was it I want to say spring of 2006 when they're like yeah the Playstation 3 is coming out in the spring of 2006 oh wait no it's not it's coming out next year
3534838	3537240	And hasn't home been delayed like four times now?
3537741	3537961	Yeah.
3538041	3539322	And we haven't had the boomerang.
3539782	3543285	Home, Spore, Forever, Duke Nukem, Chinese Democracy.
3543365	3543686	Come on.
3546208	3547469	Well, not like we have democracy here.
3549651	3549891	Anyway.
3551255	3554116	But yeah, Sony delays.
3554576	3557397	Hey, you unplugged me, bastard.
3558698	3560959	Sorry, it just makes my monitor go slightly dimmer.
3561239	3563020	Live radio.
3563040	3564700	I had to get up for a minute, sorry.
3565340	3571343	So, you know, one thing that's not been delayed is any sort of sequels to Guitar Hero.
3571563	3574044	And there's more rumors now coming out about Guitar Hero 4.
3574964	3583672	including that, yes, they're going to jump on the Rock Band bandwagon, adding vocals, drums, and regular download content to the next game.
3586154	3591558	One of the other things that they were saying that they want to add as well is local content from local bands.
3592339	3601207	Although, I'm assuming when they're saying local, that means major city local and not like, I don't know, Hoboken, you know.
3602348	3602428	Um,
3603769	3606711	Whether this will happen or not, I'm sure we'll find out at E3.
3607431	3610533	And if it does, does anyone think this is sort of copying?
3610613	3613275	I mean, do we even want to go there?
3613295	3614675	No, no other game has done this before.
3615656	3616096	Well, good.
3616656	3617417	It'll be the first.
3619738	3620058	I don't know.
3621399	3624481	What can they do to differentiate themselves from Rock Band?
3624541	3628603	Because you know that people are going to say something.
3631605	3633126	They're... I don't know.
3633663	3635164	They're going to make their drums look different.
3636904	3637285	I don't know.
3637565	3638325	Here's the thing, though.
3638365	3643347	Here's the thing that is going to piss me the F off, is that the controllers will not be compatible again.
3643367	3644268	Now, I'm telling you what.
3644368	3648490	There is going to be hell to pay from the consumers, and one of these games is going to be out.
3648950	3655793	I mean, right now there's room for two, but one of these games will be shut out if they start making these controllers incompatible with each other.
3656153	3656693	Mark my words.
3656733	3657714	Here's the thing.
3657854	3659815	The controllers were incompatible because...
3660515	3664018	Well, Microsoft says all the controllers have to work with all the games, basically.
3664218	3668341	I mean, guitar games have to work with all the guitar controllers, etc.
3669342	3672685	So you won't ever run into that issue with the Xbox 360.
3672805	3682232	Where you will run into this issue with is the Wii, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 3 versions, where they just say, where Activision's like, well, you know what?
3682893	3686256	We're just not going to license you to use these controllers, so fuck off.
3686376	3687016	Buy ours.
3688317	3688678	I don't know.
3688778	3689098	It just...
3690441	3691162	It's kind of lame.
3691943	3703958	It's kind of lame, you know, but at the same, I guess, you know, you can't just have one fighting game, one music game, but these games are expensive, and my thing is, like, I think it's a little too late.
3704138	3709385	You have to innovate or get out, and, you know, they originally were kind of trying to corner, like,
3709775	3712076	The Hardcore Guitar Playing Thing.
3712296	3722881	It's kind of like In A Groove in Dance Dance Revolution, whereas In A Groove was more technical, it was a lot harder, and they're going to do stuff like that, whereas Rock Band's more accessible.
3722941	3726923	I mean, granted, it's really expensive to get into it, but it's more accessible, it's easier.
3727283	3734447	And one was a giant flop, although you have about 100 hardcore fans that will scream and bitch and try to tell you otherwise, but...
3735984	3739526	Well, here's my thing is now Harmonix is not developing the game.
3739886	3740986	Is it going to be any good?
3741106	3745788	I mean, because I don't know if Guitar Hero 3 was quite as good as Guitar Hero 2.
3746028	3748249	I'm sure there's people who go both ways.
3748329	3754732	But, you know, the fact that they're developing entirely new stuff for like, you know, some sort of singing thing and that kind of stuff.
3755472	3755792	I don't know.
3755912	3759234	And will Harmonix sue because, you know, they're kind of ripping them off.
3760680	3761361	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3772930	3775611	How do I market a music game to the US?
3776091	3777011	I don't know.
3801220	3811365	The Triple Bonus Pack has the Memory Lamp, which will allow you to watch all the past event scenes again, which is good, because Lost Odyssey, you know, high-def cutscenes, awesomeness, good times.
3812186	3821270	Shattered Bond is a new antique that adds another one of the dream sequences in Lost Odyssey, which you really have to kind of experience a Lost Odyssey dream sequence.
3821330	3824912	It's unlike anything we've seen in gaming for a little while since, like, Zork.
3826032	3826913	But it's cool!
3827053	3828153	Like, I can't explain it.
3828213	3828473	Like, it's...
3830173	3831874	But the stories are really good.
3832735	3834816	They're really good.
3834876	3835216	Whatever.
3835236	3836056	You didn't play enough of it.
3836917	3840719	Killer Machine is a new ring also that comes out with the game.
3840819	3842540	And rings are an essential part of the game.
3842580	3843560	If you play the game, you know that.
3844701	3845281	So there you have it.
3845321	3847082	Download content for Lost Odyssey.
3847142	3848603	Also some other download content.
3848643	3849243	I think, what was it?
3849303	3849843	Army of Two.
3849863	3851984	We got some download content this week as well.
3852385	3855746	So if you're into that game, there's some new download content you can check out there.
3856607	3858768	600 points for the SSC Challenge.
3859714	3860554	Army of your mom.
3862195	3864015	Well, Army of me and your mom would be too.
3865075	3865576	You know what?
3867676	3868916	The next story makes me sad.
3869177	3869577	Why is that?
3870017	3875498	Well, it doesn't make me sad as far as their stance, but it makes me sad for the industry in general.
3879099	3886221	There is a story run in the New York Times about Stern Pinball being the last pinball factory left in the world.
3887586	3897554	and the president of the company, Gary Stern, basically said that they're planning on sticking around and that they expect the industry to rebound in the next 10 years.
3899415	3902918	It's basically become more of the enthusiast market these days.
3903198	3909042	So now that when they're selling their machines, they're not going to arcades, they're going to people.
3910663	3913225	We're going to the people who really care about the product.
3914646	3915427	I just think it's sad.
3916227	3916948	Damn you, Williams.
3919269	3921130	I just hope it doesn't go away forever.
3921170	3921630	You know what I mean?
3921650	3923852	When you hear there's only one left, it's kind of sad.
3924732	3925712	They've got the market.
3926393	3927053	The end of an era.
3927393	3930035	Hey, you know what I was reading up on that I really want to go to this year?
3930055	3931075	The table they did was good.
3931796	3932656	California Extreme.
3932696	3933837	I've got to make sure I go this year.
3933857	3934797	Oh, I love California Extreme.
3934857	3935178	I know.
3935418	3940260	Pinnagogo is... I won't be going to it this year because I'll have company.
3940540	3940881	Oh, sad.
3941201	3943142	But Pinnagogo is Memorial Day weekend.
3943604	3944024	Oh, fun.
3944905	3947147	I think I actually have Memorial Day weekend free this year.
3947367	3950149	Oh, yeah, because Faname isn't happening for us this year.
3950489	3951370	We're sitting out this year.
3951490	3953952	So maybe I'll go to that instead.
3954072	3954453	We'll see.
3954793	3955393	Dan will be going.
3955653	3955894	Hmm.
3956934	3957255	We'll see.
3958436	3963279	Penny Arcade Expo, by the way, as long as my medical issues pull through, I'm going.
3964020	3968003	Which means, you know, it is the last weekend in August.
3968243	3968664	Seattle.
3968844	3969184	I want to go.
3970647	3975330	and, by the way, going to be a huge conglomeration of all-games podcasters there.
3975650	3978191	Like, at least six different shows have representation, if not more.
3978692	3979592	It's going to be pretty awesome.
3979652	3979972	So, good.
3979992	3980933	I hope you can go, Jamie.
3980953	3983094	I hope you can talk to wife into letting you go, Loki.
3983594	3984735	So, we'll see.
3985495	3995621	Speaking of Loki, he's got our last story for tonight, and after that story is read, we're going to open up the Skype line, which is available at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3996837	3997397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4013988	4027461	I don't know, tried to get Blizzard to allow him to create a movie for, in which Blizzard COO Paul Sams replied, we will not sell the movie rights, not to you, especially not to you.
4028482	4029082	Bravo!
4032397	4043002	They're worried that because it's such a success online that a bad movie would destroy that oncoming income, perhaps, or at least tarnish it.
4043183	4048565	Good for Blizzard for realizing what epic mistake they would have made if they had let him direct this movie.
4049946	4051847	But are we sure this is actually true?
4052327	4052827	I think it is.
4053588	4057049	Because part of me goes, this seems like a fanboy might have said this or something.
4057089	4057470	I don't know.
4057990	4058230	Yeah.
4059125	4064028	All right, well, that's going to do it for tonight's stories until we get to last-minute stories, of which I'm sure Loki has a few of tonight.
4064608	4066229	But for now, we're going to open up the Skype line.
4066249	4067950	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4068050	4070771	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4070831	4072632	Let's go to the phones and open them up.
4073492	4074293	And we've got a call.
4074333	4075313	Hello, caller, are you there?
4076174	4077154	Hey, what's up, guys?
4077394	4078015	Hey, who is this?
4078695	4081316	It's Toshin from All Games and every other chat room known to man.
4081396	4082377	What's up, Toshin?
4082397	4084518	You listen to pretty much all the All Games shows, don't you?
4085570	4087831	I listen to a lot of them because I'm a bored person.
4088111	4089252	That's alright.
4089392	4090212	That's why it's there.
4090273	4094275	You know, some people listen to regular radio, some people listen to all-games radio if they're cool.
4096156	4099357	But you've been listening to all-games for ages, haven't you?
4099397	4103279	Like, you were with them back when they were, what was that other thing, Sudo or whatever they had?
4103819	4104660	Yep.
4105020	4105660	Way back there.
4105821	4111223	No, I actually skipped G4, but I was around back when Scott was on the East Coast and all that.
4111443	4114365	Well, that's because you're in Canada, so you kind of had to skip out on G4, right?
4115847	4118409	I've never seen anything related to G4 ever, which is probably safer.
4118429	4119450	You ain't missing much.
4120571	4122293	Anyhow, what's on your mind?
4124194	4129779	I've come into a new console called Xbox 360 and I was wondering if you could recommend me some stuff.
4130840	4131320	Xbox 360.
4131400	4133541	The Xbox 360 is awesome.
4133561	4134441	Are you online with your Xbox 360?
4134482	4136342	Have you checked out Xbox Live Arcade yet?
4137063	4138863	I'm actually working on that as we speak.
4138883	4147026	I'm on a temporary laptop because my other PC got fried over the week, so I haven't been online much, but that's a different story.
4147046	4151888	But as soon as I get it back, I'm going to definitely hit up Live, and I'm going to need some friends and all that kind of stuff.
4152168	4152789	So you're invited.
4153689	4154049	Good time.
4154670	4156211	Jamie's going to recommend the Orange Box for Portal.
4156511	4159252	I was going to say on Xbox Live Arcade, you definitely want to get some stuff.
4159272	4161233	You've got to get Geometry Wars.
4161314	4162894	You've got to get... Symphony of the Night.
4162954	4163775	Symphony of the Night.
4163895	4165796	Oh, hell yeah.
4165916	4167157	You're a music game fan, right?
4167177	4168818	That's what brought you to OLR in the first place, right?
4169338	4169538	Yes.
4169618	4171119	You've got to get Rez HD.
4172080	4173861	In fact... I have that for my Dreamcast too.
4174521	4175082	In fact...
4175982	4179283	We still have a code for Rez HD that I never gave away.
4179943	4185404	And now if he just got an Xbox 360, he might be the one person who doesn't already have Rez.
4186464	4187045	Which I don't.
4187945	4191666	I might have to give Toshin the code for Rez HD.
4192606	4195066	But will we have to make Toshin do something to earn it?
4196667	4198267	What can we make Toshin do to earn it?
4198287	4199307	I'm on the hook, am I?
4200367	4200788	You what?
4200808	4202348	I'm on the hook, am I?
4203951	4206392	Oh, FootyMonster's complaining because he doesn't have Rez either.
4207232	4207892	Well, I don't know.
4208413	4209293	We'll figure something out.
4209653	4213294	Toshin, you and I will have a chat offline and maybe we can hook you up with Rez.
4213414	4215455	Maybe I'll have to make you and FootyMonster fight for it.
4217896	4221057	Ooh, maybe we'll make... He has his own podcast.
4221217	4221817	You know what we'll do?
4222237	4226319	We'll make Footy and Toshin play a game next week on the show.
4226819	4228419	We'll get some guests and we'll play match game.
4228439	4229440	Are you going to be here next week?
4230280	4230520	Up here.
4231089	4232830	Alright, we're going to get Toshin.
4233130	4234390	I'll make Footy come next week.
4234970	4236851	Footy and Toshin will play Epic Match Game.
4238291	4239912	We're going to play Epic Match Game next week.
4239972	4240792	Why is it Epic?
4241453	4242073	You'll find out.
4242133	4244714	I have a new idea for Match Game to make it Epic.
4245554	4247355	So we're going to play Epic Match Game next week.
4247735	4247975	Alright.
4249055	4250296	Alright, anyhow.
4252276	4253677	What other types of games do you like, Toshin?
4255455	4256977	I mean, I like XBLA.
4257938	4259119	I've played a couple of those games.
4260921	4261542	I like anything.
4261562	4262764	I'm pretty neutral.
4262784	4265026	I mean, I won't not down a game until I've tried it.
4265347	4268210	So I'm pretty open to trying anything like RPGs.
4268751	4271574	If you like RPGs, you must, must, must get Lost Odyssey.
4272175	4272875	It's amazing.
4273576	4276218	It's not getting enough buzz out there.
4276258	4276918	I don't know why.
4277098	4279720	It's for classic RPG fans.
4279760	4285023	If you like your old school RPGs from Super Nintendo and the Final Fantasies and stuff, you will love Lost Odyssey.
4286143	4286383	Okay.
4287884	4288645	Other types of games.
4288665	4290126	Well, of course, Portal if you're into shooters.
4290146	4292427	And the Orange Box is just a great deal overall, frankly.
4292867	4295008	Loki, what about a recommendation from you?
4295309	4296169	Grand Theft Auto 4.
4297750	4298350	What's that?
4298370	4299911	I've never heard of the series.
4300111	4301632	I keep hearing stuff about it, though.
4301953	4302593	Never heard of it.
4304253	4304533	All right.
4304753	4305753	I'll have to look into that one.
4305993	4307914	Well, there you have some suggestions, Toshin.
4307954	4309914	Good luck to you, and congratulations on your purchase.
4310814	4311875	I'll definitely check that out.
4312015	4312995	Any last thoughts for our listeners?
4315815	4317896	Just enjoy the weather.
4317956	4318756	It's getting nice out.
4318936	4319796	Turn down the garage.
4320736	4322837	It is very, very hot out here right now.
4322877	4326057	We're trying to enjoy it, but it's difficult when you're cooking alive out here.
4326718	4328238	We're cooking Mama alive.
4328258	4328978	I mean the big door.
4329798	4330178	Don't worry.
4330218	4330958	Mama will fix it.
4331619	4332239	What was that?
4332439	4333359	Not my mom.
4334560	4335801	Alright, Tosha, we gotta let you go.
4335841	4336321	Take care, buddy.
4337082	4337662	Alright, see you later.
4337802	4338143	Bye-bye.
4339824	4341665	Why is Skype acting all janky tonight?
4342626	4343787	It's acting very slow.
4344868	4345428	I don't like it.
4345949	4347009	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4347029	4347370	Who's this?
4348359	4348999	Hey, it's Ranma.
4349019	4349720	What's up, everyone?
4349740	4357746	Not much, although I've got to say Skylark is like, in chat room, Skylark is like jumping up and down screaming Eternal Sonata, which also was a really good game.
4357786	4365851	And if you like more action-oriented RPGs, like not of the Kingdom Hearts caliber necessarily, it's just a great story.
4365952	4368473	If you like a good story, I do recommend Eternal Sonata.
4368553	4369294	All right, what's up, Ranma?
4370694	4372215	Well, a couple of things before I begin.
4373336	4380703	I'm glad that you guys finally mentioned Video Power because every time you mention Starcade, I'm like, I've never seen this show.
4381104	4383406	Am I the only one that's ever seen Video Power?
4386225	4389106	I have never seen Video Power, but apparently Jamie has.
4389406	4390486	I've seen Video Power.
4390627	4390927	Really?
4391427	4392567	How did I miss this show?
4392607	4401170	There was one episode where the kid had to Velcro a Nintendo Entertainment System box to his head like he was running through a maze.
4402950	4403331	It was funny.
4405131	4405531	Good times.
4405571	4407512	Were you a contestant on Video Power or something?
4408490	4411991	No, but believe it or not, Video Power was actually two seasons.
4412011	4415232	The first season was with the kid that hosted as a game show.
4415272	4422915	He would come in, show the Video Power cartoon, and at the end of the show, you put up either a review or a secret code, and that was it.
4423235	4426496	Then the second season was nothing but the game show aspect of it.
4430417	4434419	So it started as a game advice show, and then it morphed into a game show?
4434439	4434939	That's kind of weird.
4435768	4445194	Yeah, it was sponsored by Acclaim because it was all about Narc, Quirk, Bigfoot, Arch Rivals, all that together as a superhero team.
4446135	4447216	Whatever happened to Acclaim?
4447456	4448737	Are they still around?
4449037	4449818	No, they went under.
4449838	4453380	But they came back doing MMOs now.
4454101	4454541	Interesting.
4456127	4462072	Well, VidPowa, what other old school... Actually, we used to have a chatter named VidPowa, now that I think about it.
4462092	4465495	That's why I said it that way, because there was a chatter all the time that we had here.
4465935	4467136	I wonder if they got his name from that.
4468758	4472801	What other types of old school video game-based TV shows do you remember?
4474102	4477025	I actually remember the Qbert cartoon and Donkey Kong.
4477045	4477305	Yes.
4478546	4481889	I remember the Qbert cartoon, because it had the Valley Girl sort of character on there, too.
4482950	4483270	Mm-hmm.
4485786	4489227	I remember a Pac-Man cartoon, but I don't remember Q-Bert.
4490827	4496389	I remember one year, they had Pac-Man saving Santa Claus, and they played it at night, and I was so happy.
4498390	4506573	I always wanted to go on Nick Arcade, but I never did, because my parents didn't take me places where I could go on.
4506613	4506813	What?
4507173	4508993	I did watch Captain N, and it pissed me off.
4509414	4509854	Why is that?
4510514	4512795	Because I was like, dude, these characters aren't like that.
4513055	4513515	This sucks.
4514491	4515671	I love the Super Mario Bros.
4515691	4516251	Super Show.
4517131	4518392	I liked the Zelda episodes.
4518592	4520592	Yes, Zelda Fridays were always awesome.
4521092	4522012	That's all on DVD now.
4522032	4524353	I actually did like the Super Mario World one they did too.
4524513	4525353	That one was pretty cool.
4526713	4527413	Good times.
4527653	4529374	And you could always do the Mario at the end of the show.
4529754	4530714	Alright, enough reminiscing.
4530734	4532034	Anything else you want to share with the listeners, Ranma?
4532794	4534975	Sky, did you get Mario Kart Wii yet?
4535135	4536115	Did you call me Scott?
4537055	4537195	No.
4537215	4537735	I said Sky.
4537935	4538495	Oh, Sky.
4539095	4540175	I was like, wrong show.
4541296	4542616	I know he's speaking New York.
4542876	4543036	Sorry.
4544520	4545860	Did I get Mario Kart Wii yet?
4545981	4546441	I did not.
4546581	4546761	Yes.
4546941	4547621	I haven't picked it up yet.
4547641	4548001	Why not?
4548501	4550622	I spent the money on a new air conditioner for the garage today.
4551182	4552783	So I'll probably get it this week.
4553843	4554564	It's a great game.
4554644	4555204	I'm loving it.
4555424	4555664	I know.
4555704	4558365	We played, you know, Loki had the advanced copy and we played it.
4558445	4559725	So, you know, I got my fill of it.
4559745	4565247	But I will buy the game because I do want to play online with other people, even if Toadette's in the game and I can't stand her.
4566468	4567608	Well, there's also Baby Peach.
4567668	4568448	That's not so bad.
4569329	4569729	That's true.
4571434	4572736	Loki, I want your friend code.
4573016	4574878	I owe you an ass beating in Mario Kart.
4575780	4576581	I'll think about it.
4576701	4579685	As soon as I get online, I'm going to stop playing.
4579705	4580646	God, you're lazy.
4580946	4584270	As soon as he can tear himself away from Grand Theft Auto 4.
4584751	4586333	Alright, Ranma, we've got to let you go to get more calls.
4586493	4587535	Take care, buddy.
4587575	4588055	Later, guys.
4590416	4594338	Good luck tearing Loki away from Grand Theft Auto 4 for a few days.
4594858	4596579	What the fuck is wrong with Skype today?
4596639	4598520	It's running horribly on my end.
4598760	4599800	At least the calls sound fine.
4600120	4601081	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4601101	4601421	Who's this?
4602521	4603042	Hey, what's up, guys?
4603062	4603762	This is FootyMonster.
4604002	4605443	Well, hello, FootyMonster.
4605523	4606923	So are you going to be here next week?
4608024	4608484	Definitely.
4608564	4610145	I want that free coffee for 60.
4610305	4611385	All right.
4611665	4614947	It's going to be you and Toshin duking it out in Epic Match Game.
4615127	4615707	Just you wait.
4616792	4618954	The gloves are off, or whatever you want to call it.
4619555	4620495	Alright, it's going to be good times.
4621236	4621997	So what's on your mind, Fuddy?
4623098	4629463	Well, basically I wanted to share with you guys what I think personally is the best RPG I've played in a long time.
4630084	4631025	Persona 3?
4631545	4631906	Again?
4632186	4636710	No, it's actually The World Ends With You for the DS that came out just last week.
4638812	4641995	Let me tell you, it's out there with console RPGs.
4642930	4644570	It's pretty fantastic.
4644891	4649352	You know, if I wasn't in such a PSP mood this week, I would have totally bought that game.
4649432	4651652	I think the soundtrack's pretty hopping.
4651892	4657374	Describe what this game's all about, because I've not seen much about it except for some of the artwork and the soundtrack.
4657414	4658274	How does this game work?
4659534	4661635	Well, this game has different mechanics.
4661675	4669017	Let me start by saying it's a game that can be as hardcore as you want it to be, but at the same time it can be as simple as you want it to be.
4669554	4692486	which I think is very interesting because for portable people, especially RPG players on the go, maybe they don't want to delve too much into an RPG that's super complex, but yet this game allows you to make it either really complex, like for instance Shadow Slayer plays it in a really simple way, and I played it in a super complex way, in which I do much more stuff, yet we're both enjoying it just as much, which I thought was brilliant.
4692847	4693287	Interesting.
4694913	4699678	For instance, the game works on both screens at the same time, and you control two characters at the same time.
4700059	4701581	One on the bottom screen, and one on the top screen.
4702381	4709910	On the bottom screen, you control with your style to move and attack, and on the top screen, you move by your D-pad, or if you're right-handed or left-handed, with the face buttons.
4710690	4714635	And what you do, which sounds really convoluted, because you basically work...
4715686	4717067	on both planes at the same time.
4717747	4725652	But the beauty is that you can actually set the other character to move automatically if you don't want to, or maybe automatically if you don't move it by every two seconds.
4725752	4729574	So that way it gives you this freedom of like, okay, do I want to be really hardcore right now?
4730155	4733857	Or do I just, I'm just playing for 30 minutes and I don't want to really buzz my head in with this.
4734597	4736218	And I thought that was pretty impressive.
4736419	4739881	Same with on the fly for different difficulty settings that you can change.
4740796	4748401	You can go with easy, with super easy, normal, which is okay, except for the boss battle, hard, which is always hard, and ultimate, which is impossible, basically.
4771816	4775377	Right, that's kind of the thing, only that you can't really let anyone else control it.
4775517	4783099	Although I was thinking when I was playing this game with Jack, we were thinking, dude, how awesome would it be if with Wi-Fi you could control top screen and I could control bottom screen or vice versa.
4783119	4784279	It'd be so much fun.
4784839	4792981	But this game really surprised me because I actually wrote in the audience forums a small, super tiny paragraph that basically describes how I feel about this game.
4793501	4799262	Because I tried to wrap it out in a way that I let people call in as well and not, you know,
4801693	4804535	So, if you'll allow me, I'd like to read that.
4804735	4805776	It's like five lines.
4805996	4806637	Of course, go for it.
4808598	4812621	Basically, what I said is, it's bar none the best RPG I've played in a while, at least on portables.
4813142	4818265	Mass Effect and Persona 3 take the cake on consoles, for sure, at least in what I've played lately, right?
4818606	4830555	I was totally hooked with the story and the impressive amount of plot twists that never cease to be interesting, which totally surprised me because I can't remember the last time a BS game or a PSP game engaged me in that way.
4831243	4833424	in that way that I go, okay, I can't really put this down.
4834604	4835565	Lost Odyssey could do with you.
4836645	4839887	That kind of commitment, which blew my mind, really.
4840987	4852652	The game definitely must be played by any DS owner just because it's really accessible as an RPG because you can tone everything down, play easy, automatic on your partner, and just never worry about anything by looking at the cool story.
4853512	4857474	Or you can go all the way hardcore if you wanted to if you're a really avid RPG player.
4858490	4861231	and the music as we've heard on the break today is amazing.
4861491	4864632	And if you haven't checked it out, you need to check it out because it's fantastic.
4864692	4865492	It's out there with Persona 3.
4865633	4867973	It's super modern, super upbeat.
4868433	4878317	It has interesting beats that I really haven't heard in RPGs in a long time because, you know, RPGs today are elves and, you know, science fiction maybe and Final Fantasy and that's it.
4879036	4881359	and this modern day setting is so refreshing.
4881539	4883162	Like, you are in Shibuya.
4883362	4883662	That's it.
4883802	4885284	No frills, no nothing.
4885304	4886606	It's just a very stylish Shibuya.
4886686	4886987	That's it.
4887547	4888449	You're in Little Tokyo.
4888709	4893796	Here's one question I have about the game because I have to admit, one of the turn-offs for the game for me is that it's on the DS.
4894316	4914897	and I don't like I don't like seeing these type of like hardcore games on the DS because I don't know maybe I'm just old-fashioned but like the way I like to play my games is I like to have that big experience on the big television and really immerse myself with everything I feel like I can't be as immersed in the DS DS is more like a casual game system for me and I know I need to kind of get over it you know but
4916172	4920414	Do you think this game might have been better if it wasn't on the DS, if it was on an actual console?
4920634	4921674	Well, it's a thing.
4921834	4927476	That's why I'm so impressed by Square Enix here proving that they can do something that's not Dragon Quest and that it's not Final Fantasy.
4928116	4929537	They made a game for the DS.
4930937	4933578	It is meant to be played with the DS and you can't play it on another system.
4934138	4934719	It's that simple.
4935399	4936279	Which I thought was brilliant.
4936699	4940081	I mean, the dual screens are not used to showing a map.
4940641	4942502	There's action happening on both screens at the same time.
4942922	4943382	Basically...
4944298	4953846	Just to explain real quick, you're fighting enemies on the bottom screen, and the same enemies are cloned on the top screen, and it's kind of like fighting on a dual plane kind of battle.
4953866	4962153	So if you kill someone on the bottom screen, you die on the top screen as well, and they share the hit points from top to bottom, and you and your partner share the same hit points bar.
4962173	4966517	So if your partner falls, it starts hitting out from your bottom screen life bar, basically.
4966537	4967558	It's like a vertical bar.
4967898	4968479	Interesting.
4969269	4971070	It's a very interesting way that they've designed it.
4971090	4973352	They've said it in a way that blew my mind.
4973372	4974092	I didn't expect it.
4974393	4978715	I didn't expect it to blow my mind, not after what they've done lately, if you know what I mean.
4979616	4985020	They haven't really been creative, and this is creative, which I thought was impressive.
4985100	4985960	The combat system is deep.
4986401	4989443	The art style, oh my god, that's great.
4989523	4993726	Seriously, it's not 3D, but it's such a good 3D that doesn't make you miss 3D.
4994526	4996148	Rave, Rave, Rave.
4996209	4998592	That's all you're doing about this game, but that's great.
4998612	4999032	I'm sorry.
4999112	5001736	It's really, really good.
5001836	5006241	I didn't go into the game because it looks like emo-ish, and it's not my style.
5007202	5007623	God damn it.
5007643	5010727	I got into that game, and seriously, my life was over for a week and a half.
5010887	5012209	I finished the game two days ago.
5012899	5016901	and it's one of those games that I wish I hadn't played so I could play it again.
5017121	5020102	It's that good to me.
5020322	5021263	You know how I rave about Persona 3?
5021643	5022703	I never actually finished Persona 3.
5022923	5023684	I got burnt out.
5023984	5025805	This one, I'm not getting burnt out.
5026085	5029006	And there's a lot of stuff to do after the game is over which I think is really interesting as well.
5029586	5031087	There's a lot of stuff to do.
5031367	5041252	It's interesting because with Grand Theft Auto 4 taking all the headlines this week, it's really interesting that a game like this might slip under the radar that people may miss out on.
5041913	5043654	I agree.
5043994	5053039	I'm getting GTA 4 myself, and I'm glad that I actually put the time since the game came out to play it before this came out because I probably would have lost it otherwise.
5053559	5056221	So that's why we dedicated last week's review to that game
5059349	5060399	We did a totally enough review.
5060942	5089797	and I can't recommend it enough that's why I wanted to come on your show guys because I know there's a lot of RPG listeners here and you as well I mean you guys play RPGs as well so I wanted you to guys you need to check this out before GTA comes in and steals your lives that's all I'm saying too late for Loki but there's still there's still hope for me and Jamie so you know if you're listening to this program Footy demands that you put down Grand Theft Auto and check out The World Ends With You if you own DS and I will I promise you I'll check it out soon good stuff alright Footy we gotta let you go take more calls but have a good one okay buddy
5090723	5090983	No worries.
5091003	5091363	See you guys later.
5091383	5092003	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.
5092023	5093984	Your fearless webmaster has arrived.
5126641	5135289	I'm trying to decide what exactly I think of custom peripherals on the Wii.
5136310	5147019	I caught the latter half of Bobby's show and was listening, of course, to his complaints about the real power controls with the Mario Kart Wii wheel.
5148247	5162692	and then Loki's earlier rant about the silly extensions for the baseball game that just puts the Wii out another foot so you can crack that priceless vase and kill your TV even quicker when you let go on accident and it flails away.
5164312	5171154	There was a long, long, long ago wish list that I had and one of those was Fatal Frame moving to Nintendo.
5172255	5176116	I always, and I think I still do believe this, that the best...
5177566	5178906	I need to take a step back, I'm failing.
5181407	5189629	One of the things that I've always wanted to do is have a camera to play Fatal Frame and have it translate to the character controls in-game.
5190169	5200992	They never did that on the PS2 or Xbox, obviously, and apparently the fourth incarnation is coming to the Wii, when I'm not entirely sure, but I was reading that the other day.
5202771	5215658	and I'm just trying to decide what worth a camera clamshell would be for the Wiimote or if it would be better as a dedicated controller or if the whole thing is just bupkits and you should use the normal controller anyways.
5215758	5223662	Here's my question is what having that extra clamshell and that extra stuff, what exactly does that bring to the experience?
5225483	5231946	It would be the feeling, it would be the immersion, it would be the fact that you're not just pointing and changing channels on your TV.
5233007	5237011	I mean, that's what the whole concept around this has been.
5237071	5251485	It's been the attempt at immersion when the thing's impossible to do, or when there may be situations that prevent you from doing it, i.e., you don't golf in the rain, in the lightning storm, in the snow, you don't drive off-road at 100 miles an hour.
5251505	5253206	Well, maybe some people do, but they're just nuts.
5253907	5258051	And you can't go around taking pictures of maniacal spirits that want to kill you.
5259486	5266790	I gotta ask Loki what you think about that, because you're a big anti-Wii peripheral person.
5267351	5274915	Do you think that there are some games that might justify these different peripherals, besides maybe just Wii Fit, where that kind of is the game?
5275396	5279458	For instance, Jason's example is Fatal Frame with an actual clamshell camera.
5279898	5283520	Do you think that there's other types of games that maybe can justify the...
5284841	5285481	Silly Controllers
5310026	5310627	Thanks for watching!
5331846	5333327	You know, without having that on there.
5333367	5337310	I mean, people say, oh, yeah, well, you can weight it and stuff, so it feels more natural.
5337350	5339191	But, yeah, then you can hit stuff and break it.
5339691	5347216	But as far as, like, if they came out with something that... It would be hard for them to do it, I guess, because of the infrared and stuff.
5348217	5350918	However you would do that, it would be really weird.
5350938	5355561	But if they could pull it off in a way that was interesting, then maybe, yeah, that would be worth it.
5355621	5357563	But a lot of these things are just, like...
5359423	5364247	It's basically aimed at the people that will only buy the Wii for Wii Sports.
5364828	5369692	So they're like, oh hey, now I can add this tennis racket thing and it looks like I'm really playing tennis.
5371233	5373655	It's just for the simple-minded, I guess.
5373936	5374336	I don't know.
5376898	5377579	Simple-minded.
5377679	5378139	Very nice.
5378680	5383204	The abridged version of what I was going to say is that on the one hand, I love the Super Scope 6.
5383384	5383925	Absolutely.
5384025	5385466	Games were fantastic.
5386451	5389142	but it was so short-lived and you can't really reuse it.
5389704	5392134	But on the flip side, I just want to play Fatal Frame with the camera.
5392791	5398515	and thinking about that, I just had what probably amounts to one of the better ideas that cost way too damn much.
5398735	5404018	I'm sorry, I have to interrupt and go back to the camera because the chat room is so winter.
5404419	5416626	They said not only could that camera be used for Fatal Frame, but the clamshell camera could also be used to play the OLR Dream Game WhatTheyPlay.com Snap from last week's show.
5417687	5421930	The other inspiration was Pokemon Snap 2, so believe me, I completely understand that.
5423416	5423736	Winner.
5423816	5424397	Sorry, Jason.
5426439	5428380	All three games we found a use for the camera.
5429081	5433645	This is probably the most infeasible thing to do for cost, but this would be freaking awesome.
5433985	5437128	The reason why I would want a camera is I would want an external screen.
5437208	5441132	You know, cameras have viewfinders, they have the LCD screen and all that kind of stuff on it.
5442293	5444575	It would be interesting to have a rigging.
5445051	5450019	where the Wiimote plugs into the Nintendo DS and the DS becomes your viewfinder.
5450320	5457752	That way you have Fatal Frame on screen, but since you cannot, at least they had no better way to represent this in the PS2 version,
5458300	5461102	You cannot see the ghost's blind eye, naked eye.
5461382	5462783	You can through the viewfinder.
5463263	5464324	Lift up your DS.
5464684	5475732	It shows you the same thing your character would be seeing in the environment based off where you're pointed on on the TV, but you will only be able to see the ghost and battle it through the DS screen, at least accurately, anyways.
5476873	5481936	That would be the funnest game I have ever played, swear to God.
5482477	5486499	But it's probably not going to happen because that's... I was going to say, sadly, too damn intricate.
5486519	5487120	...crazy and...
5488140	5489561	Two damn interkits, sadly.
5491101	5494703	A kid can dream, but oh man.
5495564	5502247	I guess the end result of all this is that one-off and small-use peripherals will continue to come around.
5502547	5504988	They will attempt to find reuse in which they will fail.
5505008	5509050	They will fade into obscurity and people will reminisce like we do the Super Scope.
5509630	5512832	And the Virtual Boy.
5513372	5516674	Jason, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for the call.
5518424	5518964	Take care, buddy.
5519505	5520585	And I hope you get your dream game.
5542633	5543693	Sure, I have a few, I guess.
5545754	5550035	There's a game coming out that's got a great name, so I think it's worth checking it out.
5551135	5555717	It's a RTS game called Stalin vs. the Martians.
5557897	5563919	Basically, you play Joseph Stalin, and you have to save Russia from Martians.
5565015	5567760	And it's kind of like a real-time strategy game.
5567880	5572288	Looks similar to maybe Civilization or something like that.
5573490	5575654	Interesting name, though.
5576816	5577578	Let's see here.
5578911	5588876	Apparently our friend Lord Voldemort is on a road trip now to remove Grand Theft Auto 4 ads from U.S.
5588997	5589957	transit lines.
5590817	5607827	And apparently he has sent emails to Miami Mayor Carlos Alvarez saying Grand Theft Auto games have been obsessively played by a number of teens who have then copycatted the outrageous sociopathic violence in the games and killed innocent people.
5608567	5614351	and so he is being himself, I guess.
5615411	5616692	Now, this is actually pretty cool.
5616892	5626598	You know how they're doing Street Fighter 2 HD, which is basically an HD remix of Street Fighter, all the stuff redrawn and stuff like that?
5626878	5632582	Well, there is a homebrew project being done to do something very similar to Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
5632702	5633903	Nice.
5633943	5634223	Nice.
5634443	5639868	They're redrawing all the characters and it looks pretty good so far with new sprites.
5639908	5649777	They're going to add MP3 music to it, true 3D special stages, and then I guess a bunch more stuff.
5650157	5652900	256 colors with one alpha channel and all sorts of fun.
5653140	5653700	I'd buy that.
5654381	5655061	That sounds awesome.
5655082	5658324	That's what the Sonic 2 on Xbox Live should have been in the first place.
5658645	5658805	Yeah.
5659785	5670458	And then apparently, you remember Ben Heck, his PlayStation 3 laptop that he made went up on auction and actually ended up selling for $9,000.
5673005	5673326	Jeeez
5700669	5703292	And that is it.
5704593	5707958	Alright, then that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.
5708378	5710441	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5711282	5713184	And I'll start tonight.
5713304	5714926	My final thought is, ow, chest pain.
5715707	5716728	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5717029	5718791	Tired, hot, headache.
5719147	5720007	Loki, your final thought.
5720127	5721328	More Grand Theft Auto 4!
5721888	5723168	I'm going to Vegas this week.
5723589	5724349	Ooh, lucky you.
5725009	5725529	Lucky, lucky you.
