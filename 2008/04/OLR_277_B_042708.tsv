15000	19400	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19400	24600	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April the 27th of 2008
24600	29600	to part B of our podcast we tape live every Sunday night at orangeloungeradio.com
29600	32300	which is just going to refer you right over to allgames.com
32300	34400	which is the actual radio site where we broadcast.
34400	37000	We like people to pay attention to our own website as well
37000	40800	because that's where the podcast is hosted which many of you are listening to right now.
40800	43800	But of course, we also have a lot of live listeners who are assembled.
43800	46200	If you're listening live, but you're not in chat, why not?
46200	48800	chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be
48800	54000	or for those of you guys on the IRC Game Surge Network, just join Channel Orange Lounge.
54000	57600	All right, let's get back into some gaming news here in part B of our show.
57600	63600	All right, well we've been talking about some updates coming to Burnout Paradise over the last few weeks.
63600	68800	Recently the, I want to say it was the Bogart patch was released.
68800	73000	Although I didn't see any of the new islands or anything like that, but maybe that's coming later.
73000	79600	But there is another patch that they're talking about coming out later in August code named Davis.
79600	82000	And this one's actually going to be pretty significant.
82000	87000	It's going to be including, for the first time for the series, motorcycles.
87000	90200	And then it will also have night driving as well.
90200	94800	And the motorcycles will have actual passengers on them, which is also another first for the series
94800	98800	because the cars are all ghost cars in Burnout Paradise normally.
98800	108000	And the bikes will get their own modes and challenges as well as new locations designed to suit the bikes.
108000	114600	And no word though on what they're going to do with like Showtime mode for riding a bike.
114600	118000	Since, you know, your rider would kind of go flying through the air.
118000	122000	So yeah, that's pretty awesome.
122000	123200	I guess that's coming in August.
123200	128200	But I'm really looking forward to the expansions for the maps whenever the hell those are going to come out.
128200	133600	What is the obsession with motorcycles and racing games lately?
133600	136600	Because, you know, we had Project Gotham 4, right, added them.
136600	139800	And then we have Mario Kart, Wii is now all of a sudden got motorcycles.
139800	141400	And now Burnout.
141400	143800	It's like 2008 is the year of motorcycle.
143800	145400	Well, I guess Project Gotham came out in 07.
145400	147600	But still, it's like, you know, all the rage right now.
147600	149200	What's up with that?
149200	150600	I don't know, it's something different.
150600	151600	I guess.
151600	154600	Do you prefer motorcycle racing to car racing?
154600	156600	I don't prefer either.
156600	159800	I prefer, well, I'd have to say I like car better.
159800	164600	I think motorcycle racing is much cooler when you have a stick that you beat people with off the side of the car.
164600	164800	Road rush?
164800	165600	Yes, exactly, road rush.
165600	170000	Personally, I'm more of a fan of when they had Need for Speed 2.
170000	172400	And this is not Underground 2 or anything like that.
172400	174200	It's like the second Need for Speed game.
174200	182200	They had, like, some crazy codes you could put in to actually race as a bunch of different, like, some of the props on the side of the road and stuff.
182200	187400	Like, you could race as a log, you could race as an outhouse, as a giant T-Rex statue.
187400	191200	What else was in there that was really funny?
191200	193400	Just, like, a bunch of weird shit.
193400	196600	And I always used to love racing the log versus the T-Rex.
196600	198800	And I laugh like crazy.
198800	203000	They had something similar with, I want to say Daytona as well, you could race as a horse.
203000	205200	Now, the nighttime mode sounds cool.
205200	206800	I like racing at night.
206800	210800	But I think the nighttime, from what I'm looking at here, nighttime is not going to have any cars.
210800	212000	It's just going to be empty.
212000	212400	What?
212400	214000	It's kind of dumb.
214000	215600	Whatever.
215600	224600	Alright, well, one game we love here at Orange Lounge Radio is the Eye of Judgment, which, by the way, I checked the Orange Lounge Radio wiki today.
224600	233600	Since we have no official Wikipedia entry anymore, because some a-hole nuked it, we now have our own wiki, orangeloungeradio.wiki.com.
233600	241600	And I was looking at the latest Eye of Judgment sales figures, which now our chatters are tracking for us, just shy of 200,000 worldwide.
241600	242600	Never going to happen.
242600	243600	Never going to make a million.
243600	251600	However, for those that do happen to own Eye of Judgment, Sony is somewhat apologizing, I guess you could say, because the second set of Eye of Judgment cards...
251600	252600	Sorry about it.
252600	253600	Sorry about this game.
253600	256600	But there was a second set of cards that got delayed.
256600	260600	So three rare cards are being given away starting next Friday, but here's what I don't get.
260600	264600	How are they rare if they're giving them away?
264600	265600	Whatever.
265600	268600	They're the Eye of Judgment set to promo cards.
268600	272600	All you have to do, you watch the official PlayStation blog starting next Friday.
272600	278600	And, oh, I see why they're rare, because you have to be one of the first few hundred who registers with the mailing list, and then you get the rarities.
278600	280600	So only a few hundred of these are going to go out.
280600	282600	Or...
282600	284600	One of them will be Xeroxed and put all over the Internet.
284600	287600	Or you could just Xerox the ones right there that are available on the website.
287600	288600	No, no, no, here's the thing.
288600	291600	The ones that are going around blogs, though, you've got to look at those black bars carefully.
291600	293600	Those black bars are what the Eye of Judgment reads.
293600	295600	They're all the same on these cards.
295600	297600	So, not that easy, Loki.
297600	298600	Oh, darn.
298600	301600	I guess we'll just have to wait for one of the hundreds of people that actually...
301600	302600	Oh, who cares?
302600	303600	No one plays the game.
303600	304600	It doesn't matter.
304600	306600	Alright.
306600	312600	Black Wolf is in chat. He actually owns Eye of Judgment. He was a big supporter of trying to move a million copies of them.
312600	316600	He says the best part is that you have to pay $14.99 just to use those cards.
316600	317600	Awesome.
317600	319600	Since, you know, you've got to get set, too.
319600	320600	Awesome. Way to support that.
320600	322600	Good job.
322600	325600	Sadly, we don't get to count expansion sales towards our million.
325600	326600	Nope.
326600	327600	Doesn't matter anyways.
327600	331600	But we do get to count sales of Let's Ride Friends Forever, let's not forget.
331600	334600	Yeah, all ten of those.
334600	339600	Well, another game that we're not counting is Portal.
339600	342600	Otherwise, Loki would be in that Tingle suit right now.
342600	345600	It's a good thing we didn't count Portal.
345600	351600	Well, basically, they have said from Valve that we will not be seeing a new Portal this year.
351600	363600	But they are going to do a new game that is as revolutionary, they say, as Half-Life 2 was to the original Half-Life.
363600	367600	He's quoted as saying, it won't be Portal with different colors.
367600	370600	So, we're going to be getting something new from Valve.
370600	372600	I say good for them.
372600	374600	You don't want to beat this thing into the ground.
374600	375600	You know what I mean?
375600	377600	Sequels have so much to live up to with the originals.
377600	381600	And granted, in gaming, we often get off a lot better than in movies.
381600	385600	Like, you know, in movies, sequels, like 99% of the time, are crappier than the original.
385600	387600	Once in a while, you have a rare one that's better.
387600	391600	But in games, sometimes you get sequels that are more memorable than the original.
391600	394600	But, you know, you don't want to rush Portal.
394600	395600	You've got to make it right.
395600	396600	And I'm all for new IPs.
396600	399600	You know, Portal was a new IP when it came out.
399600	402600	So, I'm all for new things that are just as cute.
402600	406600	Just, you know, will it be good?
406600	409600	Dark Tetsuya in chat suggests, Portal 2.
409600	411600	No, really, there's cake this time.
411600	416600	No, no, no, because the cake is made with, like, dust and...
416600	418600	I say in Portal 2, you're going after pie.
418600	419600	What's better than cake?
419600	420600	Pie.
420600	421600	There you go.
421600	423600	I had a birthday pie.
423600	425600	I want a birthday pie.
425600	430600	If I can eat pie by that time, because, you know, the whole pancreas drama.
430600	433600	But you know what's in two weeks for us?
433600	434600	What, Margaret Cho?
434600	435600	I know.
435600	436600	Your birthday present is a little late.
436600	437600	Let's get pie.
437600	438600	If I can eat it.
438600	440600	It might have to be low-fat Weight Watchers pie.
440600	441600	We can eat fat-free pie.
441600	443600	Fat-free cheesecake.
443600	445600	I'd rather eat barf.
445600	451600	Well, it's not cake, but it's definitely coming a lot sooner than Portal 2.
451600	455600	It is the releases on the PlayStation Network this week.
455600	465600	And there's some pretty interesting stuff, like the EchoChrome demo that's been released out now for, I believe, the PlayStation Portable.
465600	474600	And you can also download some PlayStation 1 classics for R-Type, including R-Type 1 and R-Type 2.
474600	477600	And that's available for $6.
477600	482600	And they also have, of course, the variety map pack for Call of Duty 4 for PlayStation 3.
482600	493600	And if you happen to be a fan of Carrique Revolution American Idol Encore, they've added a variety of new songs you can check out there as well.
493600	495600	And let's see here.
495600	502600	Also, of course, the Eye of Judgment Byleth Rebellion 2 expansion set is available download for $15.
502600	504600	You know, the typical rock band stuff.
504600	507600	Guitar Hero 3 Def Leppard pack.
507600	511600	There's an Army of Two SSE Challenge pack.
511600	514600	Demo for Iron Man on the PlayStation 3.
514600	517600	Resistance Fall Man 2 teaser trailer.
517600	523600	And then there's some other stuff from different game videos and stuff.
523600	526600	And some free stuff.
526600	530600	Eye of Judgment Theme number 2 for free.
530600	534600	And the PlayStation 3 wallpaper for Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.
534600	539600	And on the PSP Store, they're actually still selling full games on there.
539600	544600	Because, remember, you can download full PSP games, including Loco Rocco, which is $21.99.
544600	551600	They've got, let's see here, I guess that's selling new free game.
551600	553600	Or, well, it's not free.
553600	556600	$21.99, that's a free deal.
556600	559600	Free after $21.99.
559600	561600	Free with $21.99 download fee.
561600	565600	There's also Kingdom of Paradise, which is $10.99.
565600	567600	So, I don't know.
567600	573600	That kind of sucks, though, because the money that you put into the PlayStation Store and stuff like that,
573600	580600	it's in whole dollars, so you're stuck with these remainder cents that you get ripped off on in each purchase.
580600	581600	Way to go, Sony.
581600	590600	Alright, well, also on the PSP soon will be Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus.
590600	592600	Yay!
592600	596600	For those fans of Guilty Gear who like their wordy game titles.
596600	597600	We went through it for Street Fighter.
597600	600600	This is coming to the PSP.
600600	604600	They call it the most complete and balanced version of the game to date.
604600	608600	So, what happens is that also the game's going to have an ad hoc mode.
608600	610600	You can do three-on-three tournaments.
610600	613600	I guess if you have the whole wireless thing going on.
613600	614600	So, that'd be fun.
614600	615600	I like Guilty Gear.
615600	620600	This information, by the way, coming from Famitsu Magazine, who is pretty reputable.
620600	623600	So, this game is coming out for the PSP.
623600	624600	So, good times.
624600	626600	Guilty Gear in your pocket.
626600	628600	What could possibly be better?
628600	633600	I actually do have the Guilty Gear mini that was on Wonderswan.
633600	634600	Nice.
634600	638600	It's very, very difficult to play that.
638600	644600	In other news, a game I don't care about, Grand Theft Auto IV.
644600	650600	Well, you know how we were chatting about that little rumor about there being a special bundle for PS3?
650600	652600	It's not a rumor.
652600	665600	It's going to be released on April 29th as a 40-gig unit with a six-axis controller and stuff.
665600	670600	And, by the way, this is the European bundle, to be specific.
670600	673600	It will be 4.39 euro.
673600	680600	So, if you care that much about it, go get it, I guess.
680600	683600	Go get it, I guess.
683600	687600	Dark Soccer Reviews Games here on Orange Launch Radio.
687600	688600	Go get it, I guess.
688600	690600	You should let me do more game reviews.
690600	692600	You should play more games.
692600	694600	We have a thing at the top of the show.
694600	698600	Well, it's not necessarily that I'm not actually playing them.
698600	702600	It's that other people are using the TV and playing the games.
702600	706600	You need to regulate and say, bitch, I own half.
706600	709600	That's why they sell, you know, monitor adapters and stuff like that.
709600	710600	I play on my computer monitor.
710600	712600	I don't even have a good monitor.
712600	713600	You know what, I have that little Disney.
713600	719600	You know what, I have this Disney princesses TV I never got a chance to use that I got for my birthday.
719600	721600	You want to take that and hook something up to it?
721600	723600	Okay.
723600	724600	Look, Dan's TV.
724600	728600	The sad thing is, I think she's serious.
728600	730600	Well, let's see what happens.
730600	732600	I'm all for more Dark Soccer game reviews.
732600	735600	Well, a game I'm sure Jamie would enjoy more than Grand Theft Auto.
735600	739600	SingStar, not yet released over here, but in Europe.
739600	746600	The SingStar has sold its one million track and that's a lot of karaoke.
746600	757600	They have apparently, the SingStar online store has 140,000 registered users and over 20,000 user submitted videos.
757600	762600	None of which are of me because I don't own the game nor will ever own the game.
762600	766600	And have been watched over 2.5 million times.
766600	774600	The franchise has also sold 12 million copies over its multiple iterations including SingStar Bollywood.
774600	784600	And it's due out over here next month on the 20th, I believe.
784600	786600	Alright.
786600	789600	So, check that out I guess.
789600	791600	SingStar, when it comes out over here.
791600	793600	Although, Loki won't be.
793600	798600	I think I'm going to buy it and then get Loki drunk and then see what happens.
798600	800600	If we can get him on the TV.
800600	802600	It might be worth it.
802600	805600	Listeners, let's do a quick poll in chat.
805600	807600	Quick poll, here we go.
807600	809600	Answer the question Y or N.
809600	816600	Is it worth the $600 investment for a Playstation 3 simply to upload Loki drunk karaoke to the interwebs?
816600	819600	You'd also have to buy a Playstation I.
819600	823600	Alright, is it worth the $650 adjustment or whatever?
823600	824600	Let's throw in booze.
824600	828600	Is it worth the $700 investment?
828600	830600	I'm not going to do that.
830600	832600	Answer the question.
832600	834600	Let's see, oh, we have some answers coming in already.
834600	837600	Let's see, we have Y, Y, N from cheeseburger.
837600	847600	F and Y, so Y, hell fucking Y, Y, Y, well Y, Y, Y, Y, lowercase Y, I think.
847600	850600	And then we have Dora the Explorer TV is greater than Disney Princess TV.
850600	853600	That wasn't the question.
853600	854600	Alright.
854600	856600	There you go, almost 100%.
856600	857600	Everyone except cheeseburger.
857600	859600	Well cheeseburger, you can just sit that night out.
859600	861600	You can go sit in the corner.
861600	862600	I say N.
862600	863600	Alright, why?
863600	864600	Because I already have one.
864600	866600	Alright, oh, there we go.
866600	868600	Even better, we'll just bring yours over.
868600	871600	And then all we have to do is buy Sing Star in a can.
871600	872600	I want Sing Star.
872600	873600	Loki don't glare at me.
873600	874600	I do want Sing Star.
874600	875600	I know, it'll be fun.
875600	876600	I played it at E3.
876600	877600	It'll be fun.
877600	880600	And I sang, what's that Motorhead song?
880600	881600	Ace of Spades.
881600	883600	With some guy.
883600	891600	Oh, here's what we'll do is I'll sing, but I'll make you turn around and I'll just say I'm David Cook.
891600	893600	And then you'll get all excited.
893600	897600	Anyhow, by the way guys, Jamie is hella into American Idol this year.
897600	900600	It's hilarious.
900600	904600	I...
904600	905600	It's not funny.
905600	906600	No, it's hilarious.
906600	907600	It's great.
907600	908600	Why is it funny?
908600	909600	Well they got rid of that bitch.
909600	910600	Because it's cute.
910600	911600	They got rid of that bitch Carly though.
911600	912600	I like her.
912600	913600	Alright, shut up right now.
913600	915600	Shut up right now.
915600	916600	Video game podcast.
916600	919600	First of all, did you listen to her old shit?
919600	922600	She sings so much better now than she did five years ago.
922600	923600	Too bad.
923600	924600	I apologize.
924600	926600	On top of that, they said that she'd had the best performance ever.
926600	931600	It's just a stupid fucking popularity contest, but David Cook is still going to win.
931600	932600	That is true.
932600	934600	That is because he's freaking awesome.
934600	935600	That's it.
935600	936600	I'm changing my cage match song.
936600	938600	I'll give you a dollar.
938600	941600	Alright, fine.
941600	942600	He's great.
942600	943600	You know what?
943600	944600	They can all kiss my ass.
944600	946600	We have games to talk about.
946600	947600	It's my turn.
947600	948600	Is it?
948600	949600	Oh.
949600	950600	Is it?
950600	951600	No.
951600	952600	We have an international story.
952600	953600	We do.
953600	956600	We have an international story straight out of Singapore.
956600	957600	They can't somebody.
957600	960600	No, they did not cane somebody, but I don't know.
960600	962600	They may have some type of crazy outbreak here.
962600	963600	Here's the thing.
963600	967600	There's a brand new rating system that has been announced in Singapore.
967600	971600	You know, rating systems are overall a good thing as long as people are educated on them,
971600	974600	but here's the kind of weak point about it.
974600	978600	People Like Us has identified a problem with the rating system.
978600	982600	People Like Us, by the way, is a Singapore gay and lesbian group focused on advocacy
982600	983600	and public education.
983600	985600	Here's the thing.
985600	991600	If a game contains homosexuality, it is instantly an adult theme rating just because you might
991600	994600	have some hot girl on girl action like you have in Mass Effect.
994600	996600	Here's a quote from People Like Us.
996600	1000600	People Like Us considers this new rule unjustifiably strict.
1000600	1003600	Children should not have to be kept ignorant about the presence of gay people in society
1003600	1007600	any more than they should be shielded from people of other faiths and ethnicities.
1007600	1010600	The path to acceptance of gay people is through teaching children and diversity from a young
1010600	1011600	age.
1011600	1016600	It is pejorative to love gay sexual orientation with crime and drug use, as the MDA's new
1016600	1020600	guidelines do, as if gay orientation is some kind of social threat.
1020600	1024600	Now, I think it goes without saying that obviously it's kind of stupid because this is the
1024600	1030600	equivalent of Brokeback Mountain is automatically an NC-17 rated movie because, you know, oh
1030600	1032600	my God, butt sex, right?
1032600	1034600	So, here's the thing.
1034600	1036600	But it's hot.
1036600	1042600	Here's the thing is that, okay, the even kind of bigger issue here is that, like, are there
1042600	1044600	really that many games that this is going to affect?
1044600	1045600	I mean, don't get me wrong.
1045600	1046600	I totally agree.
1046600	1050600	It's stupid that this would be, you know, cause a game to get an adults only rating.
1050600	1053600	But are there really that many games that are going to fall into this category?
1053600	1056600	I mean, how many gay characters in games do we have?
1056600	1058600	Sadly, not a lot.
1058600	1063600	And I'm not saying that, shut up, I'm not saying that we suddenly have to get all these
1063600	1068600	games to come out that have OMG, a token gay in them, or, you know, a gay lead character.
1068600	1073600	But I think it would be nice if, like, you know, in an RPG or something, and I'm not
1073600	1077600	talking about Enchanted Arms and that Makoto guy, okay, I'm not even talking about that.
1077600	1082600	I'm talking about, I think it would be great to just see a character who just happens to
1082600	1087600	be gay, and it's no big D. You know, it's just, okay, whatever, cool, right?
1087600	1091600	Cause I think the nice thing about the youth of America, and, you know, I would say the
1091600	1095600	youth of the world in general, and most of the countries probably listen to our show
1095600	1097600	anyway, is that most people kind of have that attitude.
1097600	1102600	I think most young people know at least one gay or lesbian person in their real life.
1102600	1104600	I mean, you know one on the internet, hello.
1104600	1105600	Who?
1105600	1106600	Huh?
1106600	1107600	Where?
1107600	1109600	You know one on the internet, but I'm saying, like, at least in their personal lives.
1109600	1113600	You know, I'm just saying, I think most people are just like, whatever, it's no big deal
1113600	1114600	in this day and age anymore.
1114600	1117600	It's just, people are different.
1117600	1121600	And I would like to see that same attitude in games, but I know there's some people that
1121600	1125600	have that archaic attitude of, ew, ew, it's too gay, ew, ew.
1125600	1130600	Well, you know, then don't put it in Grand Theft Auto, but there's plenty of, you know,
1130600	1134600	other games that would be just fine with it.
1134600	1136600	This guy's voiced the game.
1136600	1137600	No.
1137600	1142600	Uh, Saig in chat says, it's not about existing games, but it's the reason that sexuality
1142600	1145600	themes are limited because of rating systems would overreact.
1145600	1149600	You know, and that's kind of true too, is that how often is sexuality even a factor
1149600	1150600	in games?
1150600	1151600	Violence?
1151600	1152600	Hell yeah, everywhere.
1152600	1155600	Cursing even starts to see more and more.
1155600	1156600	Sexuality?
1156600	1157600	Not so much.
1157600	1166600	Because OMG Boobs gets you an instant, you know, auto, you know, MC, MA, AO, rating.
1166600	1167600	So.
1167600	1168600	Uh.
1168600	1170600	These people are sad.
1170600	1172600	It's just silly.
1172600	1175600	I would do the FUs of the Week right here, but it's just, I don't know.
1175600	1181600	I mean, I, sadly it's not surprising, but I think the bigger issue is there's not a
1181600	1184600	lot of games that are going to fall into this category.
1184600	1187600	Why don't we work on that first?
1187600	1188600	So.
1188600	1190600	That's it.
1190600	1192600	Now we can move on to your story, Jamie.
1192600	1193600	Now it's time.
1193600	1194600	Okay.
1194600	1203600	The beta for Battlefield Heroes is going to be in May.
1203600	1204600	That's it?
1204600	1205600	What the hell is Battlefield Heroes?
1205600	1206600	I've never even heard of this game.
1206600	1207600	It's on the 6th.
1207600	1214600	It's a free-to-play cartoon sort of version of an online shooting series.
1214600	1218600	The ads, it's actually funded by ads, but it's not in-game, it's on the website.
1218600	1219600	Oh, so it's like a PC game?
1219600	1220600	Yeah.
1220600	1222600	Because I hear cartoon, I think of Wii.
1222600	1227600	But I think that I had seen a little bit of it and it looks like it might be a little
1227600	1228600	bit fun.
1228600	1232600	So, I thought that, you know, especially anything that's free, I thought that people would
1232600	1234600	be into it.
1234600	1237600	So, May 6th.
1237600	1238600	Beta.
1238600	1239600	All right.
1239600	1243600	Hey, I like beta and I like free games even more.
1243600	1244600	Betamax.
1244600	1249600	Another EA game that's getting a, well not really a beta, but a demo.
1249600	1250600	A VHS?
1250600	1251600	No, not a VHS.
1251600	1252600	Laserdisc?
1252600	1253600	No.
1253600	1254600	A DVD?
1254600	1255600	Spore.
1255600	1259600	They're getting the Spore creature creator and demo.
1259600	1261600	Those are both coming June 17th.
1261600	1271600	The Spore creature creator is actually supposedly part of the, I believe there's like a SimCity
1271600	1273600	pack or Sims pack coming out.
1273600	1278600	That'll be a part of that as well as, well if you don't want to purchase it as part of
1278600	1282600	that, you can also get the, I guess, demo for $9.99.
1282600	1287600	And what the creature creator will allow you to do is create, you know, creatures obviously.
1287600	1291600	You can export those creatures to wallpapers and stuff like that.
1291600	1295600	So, plus I guess the creatures can be used in the full game when that actually finally
1295600	1296600	comes out.
1296600	1298600	You know what's kind of sad?
1298600	1300600	I like forgot about Spore.
1300600	1305600	Remember I was so hyped about this game after we saw that one demo at E3 in like, what,
1305600	1306600	2005?
1306600	1308600	I was like so hyped up for Spore, right?
1308600	1310600	I kind of forgot about Spore.
1310600	1313600	They might as well just rename this game Spore Chinese Democracy.
1313600	1315600	It's the next PC game I'm going to buy.
1315600	1320600	I mean, because I don't really, well the last game I bought, and I didn't really technically
1320600	1324600	buy it because I got it for free, was Crysis.
1324600	1326600	It came with my graphics card.
1326600	1328600	What about Wrath of the, well I know you're not a Warcraft player.
1328600	1330600	I'll probably buy Wrath of the Lich game for this.
1330600	1331600	Fuck the Warcraft shit.
1331600	1332600	Eh, whatever.
1332600	1333600	Teach their own.
1333600	1335600	No, I'm excited about Spore.
1335600	1338600	I just kind of, sadly I forgot it was out there because the game, like, doesn't seem
1338600	1340600	to ever be coming.
1340600	1343600	So I don't know, I guess maybe this is a good sign that it'll be on its way.
1343600	1345600	Will you check out just the creature creator?
1345600	1347600	Or are you just going to be like, screw it?
1347600	1351600	Uh, I think I'm just going to be like, screw it.
1351600	1352600	I don't want to spoil it.
1352600	1356600	Are there any PC games you're excited about, Dark Sakura?
1356600	1358600	Ragnarok 2, maybe.
1358600	1360600	So your games have to come from Korea.
1360600	1362600	Yeah, Korea.
1362600	1363600	Alright.
1363600	1367600	I wouldn't mind having an updated Sonic R.
1367600	1371600	Um, Rock Band is a game we all own and love and play on the internet.
1371600	1373600	I was actually playing a little bit of Rock Band this week.
1373600	1377600	I was playing with our webmaster VX JasonXV and Rychan.
1377600	1381600	I was playing with them, and sadly, Xbox, well,
1381600	1384600	Xbox was kind of having sporadic connection issues.
1384600	1386600	Our game got dumped, and then like, I left to go get dinner,
1386600	1389600	and then I totally got sidetracked and didn't come back until like hours later.
1389600	1391600	I felt kind of bad, but you know, it's just a video game.
1391600	1393600	But Rock Band's fun to play online.
1393600	1395600	I need to go on and play with some listeners at some point,
1395600	1397600	even though now they're all on Mario Kart Wii.
1397600	1402600	But Rock Band has some new songs coming out, as they do every week.
1402600	1405600	Two of the songs this week come from the same band,
1405600	1408600	The Mother Hips, which are from Chico, California.
1408600	1410600	I know that because I used to live there,
1410600	1413600	so I think it's kind of funny that now they're having all this success through a video game.
1413600	1417600	But there you have Red Tandy and Time Six Son of a Grizzly Bear from The Mother Hips.
1417600	1420600	I wonder if they still play at Brickworks, I don't know.
1420600	1424600	But that is coming at some point to Rock Band.
1424600	1426600	That would be next Tuesday, actually.
1426600	1429600	But the Smashing Pumpkins, you know them, they have a song already in the game.
1429600	1431600	They have what, Cherub Rock is in the game.
1431600	1435600	And now you can download Zero, which has some pretty awesome guitar.
1435600	1437600	Remember that song, Zero?
1437600	1440600	Although, props to you if you can sing like Billy Corgan.
1440600	1441600	No.
1441600	1443600	Because he's got something going on.
1443600	1446600	I'm sad when a man can sing higher than me.
1446600	1448600	Billy Corgan is sadly not David Cook, is he?
1448600	1449600	No.
1449600	1450600	All right.
1450600	1452600	Let's get to the mailbag.
1452600	1454600	Every week we encourage you guys to send us some e-mails.
1454600	1457600	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to do it.
1457600	1459600	Dark Sakura will dive into the e-mailbag every week,
1459600	1463600	but she wears plastic gloves when she does it because she doesn't want anthrax poisoning.
1463600	1466600	Anthrax was an 80s band, not a poison.
1466600	1467600	Anthrax is great.
1467600	1468600	All right.
1468600	1470600	So here it is, our mailbag segment.
1470600	1472600	Dark Sakura, read some e-mails.
1472600	1475600	Crap, crap, crap, crap done.
1475600	1476600	No, I'm kidding.
1476600	1478600	We just got a lot of crap this week.
1478600	1482600	No, although some underage girl wanted to show me her private pictures.
1482600	1484600	Oh, damn that spam.
1484600	1485600	I know.
1485600	1489600	That's supposed to be coming to me.
1489600	1491600	No, I'm not going to say it.
1491600	1494600	Anyway, hi guys.
1494600	1501600	On the show before last Rob said Live 365 idiots charged him after he sent two e-mails saying he quit.
1501600	1505600	He said he would give us an update on it last week and never did.
1505600	1507600	So my question is, what's going on with that?
1507600	1511600	Also I have been listening since episode 150 and I still don't know why Loki hates Tingle.
1511600	1513600	P.S. I attached a picture.
1513600	1514600	I was bored.
1514600	1516600	Misspelled.
1516600	1517600	Who's it from?
1517600	1522600	Oh, it's a little picture of Tingle with Loki's face on it and it says Loki.
1522600	1523600	How wonderful.
1523600	1524600	All right.
1524600	1527600	And that's from I Can Ask Cheeseburger.
1527600	1528600	I Can Ask Cheeseburger.
1528600	1529600	Thank you.
1529600	1532600	I did forget to give the Live 365 update because it's kind of funny what happened.
1532600	1535600	You might remember I was really pissed because they charged my credit card
1535600	1538600	and it was a little unfair of me to not give the follow up.
1538600	1540600	So I apologize to them.
1540600	1545600	But strangely enough that next Monday mysteriously with no e-mail.
1545600	1546600	Well, no, I did get an e-mail.
1546600	1549600	I got a little e-mail in my inbox that says,
1549600	1554600	Rob, we have processed the cancellation and they refunded my credit card the entire money.
1554600	1555600	Sweet.
1555600	1558600	So they did not end up stealing the money for me.
1558600	1560600	It was only out of my bank account for a couple of days.
1560600	1561600	They borrowed it for a couple of days.
1561600	1562600	They borrowed it for a couple of days.
1562600	1564600	They poked it and did experiments.
1564600	1569600	But the strange thing is we got like a little bit of kickback from our VIP listenership.
1569600	1572600	The more VIPs that we had listening to us in Live 365, we got some kickback.
1572600	1574600	But honestly, guys, it was nothing.
1574600	1580600	I think we got like $1.37 from the month of March.
1580600	1584600	So I actually got refunded that $1.37 back as well.
1584600	1586600	So I actually did get a little bit of interest, I guess you could say,
1586600	1591600	thanks to our VIP listeners who I do feel bad for that we're not on Live 365 anymore.
1591600	1594600	But all games is where it's at, yo.
1594600	1595600	It's where it's at.
1595600	1596600	Get in.
1596600	1597600	Live in the now.
1597600	1604600	Also, Sauce says that Poison was also an 80s band, Rob.
1604600	1605600	That is true.
1605600	1607600	Anthrax is Poison and Poison was also an 80s band.
1607600	1608600	That's crazy.
1608600	1610600	Darktitsuiya said the exact same thing in chat.
1610600	1611600	Great minds think alike.
1611600	1612600	That's kind of freaky.
1612600	1614600	I like what my husband says.
1614600	1616600	Great minds think like us.
1616600	1618600	Loki, describe your hatred of Tingle.
1618600	1620600	Why is it you hate Tingle so damn much?
1620600	1623600	I think he's a stupid character, that's all.
1623600	1624600	He was annoying.
1624600	1627600	He was annoying in Wind Waker.
1627600	1631600	This fascination with everybody for me to do Tingle's voice, I don't know.
1631600	1632600	It's just retarded.
1632600	1634600	I think you actually did it one night and that's what was funny.
1634600	1635600	I did it one night, yes.
1635600	1637600	And that was the biggest mistake you ever made.
1637600	1638600	There you go.
1638600	1640600	Because people don't know when to let a joke go.
1640600	1641600	All right.
1641600	1642600	That joke has been going on forever.
1642600	1643600	Anyway.
1643600	1645600	All right, moving on.
1645600	1650600	This email is from someone in Australia, I believe.
1650600	1651600	So.
1651600	1652600	Crikey.
1652600	1653600	Hi.
1653600	1657600	I've been listening for the past six months on podcasts and have been enjoying it.
1657600	1661600	It breaks up the ride to and from work, so I'm not bored just looking at the window,
1661600	1663600	seeing the same thing every day.
1663600	1666600	I can't listen live as it's in the middle of Monday and I'm at work.
1666600	1669600	Only have been live once.
1669600	1671600	The changeover to all games has been good.
1671600	1674600	I've noticed the upgrade in audio from the first second.
1674600	1679600	Glad to see you've left dead 365.
1679600	1683600	I actually do want to point out the change in audio has nothing to do with our all games move.
1683600	1685600	The live change in audio, yes.
1685600	1690600	The podcast change in audio was just a decision that we just did.
1690600	1694600	We went through it and that is that we used to be encoded in 56K stereo.
1694600	1696600	But honestly, how much music have we been playing on the show?
1696600	1697600	Not a lot.
1697600	1698600	So we downgraded.
1698600	1702600	We actually downgraded to mono, but we went to 64K mono.
1702600	1707600	There's a lot of difference there in the sound quality, so it sounds really good.
1707600	1710600	I've been playing Mario Kart Wii quite a bit over the past few months,
1710600	1713600	and I found out something that Rob won't like too much.
1713600	1716600	Sorry to tell you, Rob, but Toadette is an unlockable character on Mario Kart Wii.
1716600	1719600	God damn it!
1719600	1721600	Thanks for everything and keep up the good work.
1721600	1727600	Long live the ferret.
1727600	1729600	That's the one I was trying to get to.
1729600	1732600	King Mill is also sponsored by the Olive Garden.
1732600	1734600	Unfortunately, no never-ending breadsticks here in Australia.
1734600	1736600	What?
1736600	1738600	Thanks is from Michael.
1738600	1743600	Bobby Blackwolf's in chat, our old buddy who errors an hour before us.
1743600	1745600	He is actually taking credit for the sound upgrade.
1745600	1748600	He says, no, actually, all games is responsible for this change too.
1748600	1749600	Don't believe Rob.
1749600	1752600	We were like, you can't come unless you're in 64K mono.
1752600	1754600	It's true.
1754600	1755600	Rob.
1755600	1756600	What?
1756600	1757600	Rob.
1757600	1758600	What?
1758600	1760600	On May 1st, let's go to Olive Garden.
1760600	1762600	I can't.
1762600	1764600	I'm still on the low-fat diet until at least...
1764600	1765600	You can get low-fat?
1765600	1766600	Really?
1766600	1767600	Yes.
1767600	1769600	All right, then we can go on May 1st.
1769600	1773600	I will personally look over their menu and pick out the crap that isn't fat.
1773600	1775600	You can get a diet menu anywhere.
1775600	1776600	That's what I've learned.
1776600	1778600	I've been in Vegas on May 1st.
1778600	1780600	All right, here we go with the Food Network again.
1780600	1782600	But here's the quick thing.
1782600	1785600	If the listeners that have been listening for a couple months know that I have issues in my pancreas,
1785600	1789600	I'm going to pick low-fat diet because of it until at least May 9th.
1789600	1794600	Here's the thing is that like part of the thing I've learned,
1794600	1798600	like I went to Ruby Tuesdays this week with some of my coworkers that were visiting from L.A.
1798600	1801600	and they were getting the spinach dip and the avocado dip and they were like,
1801600	1802600	mmm, this is so good.
1802600	1803600	I'm so sorry, Rob.
1803600	1804600	I'm so sorry you can't eat this.
1804600	1806600	So I learned that they have a diet menu.
1806600	1808600	You know what I ate at Ruby Tuesdays, nice low-fat?
1808600	1812600	I ate an unflavored piece of cooked chicken and broccoli.
1812600	1814600	That was my dinner.
1814600	1817600	Whoop-de-hoo.
1817600	1825600	Well, I think that also part of, I think that, you know, possibly the,
1825600	1829600	you didn't ask if it's all the fats or if it's just saturated, saturates.
1829600	1830600	It's all fat.
1830600	1831600	It's any fat.
1831600	1832600	Oh, man.
1832600	1833600	I can't have fat.
1833600	1834600	I can't have caffeine.
1834600	1835600	I can't have carbonation.
1835600	1836600	You can't digest vitamin E now.
1836600	1837600	It's horrible.
1837600	1838600	You cannot digest vitamin E.
1838600	1841600	May 5th marks one month since I got out of the hospital.
1841600	1844600	But here's the thing, I had Thai food last night in San Francisco
1844600	1846600	that I thought was going to be healthy for me,
1846600	1850600	and I think I overindulged a little bit because my chest was hurting last night,
1850600	1852600	and that's not a good sign.
1852600	1853600	I'm really worried.
1853600	1854600	I don't want to have this forever.
1854600	1856600	All right, OL Foodio is over.
1856600	1858600	Let's get back to the e-mail.
1858600	1859600	Hey, give me a second.
1859600	1860600	My eyes hurt.
1860600	1861600	Orange Lounge Foodio.
1861600	1862600	Okay.
1862600	1863600	Hey, OLR.
1863600	1866600	First off, a big F-you to Nintendo for giving a mandatory update
1866600	1868600	with Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
1868600	1871600	I permanently have Photo Channel 1.1.
1871600	1875600	This means I need to make M4A files to listen to music on Photo Channel,
1875600	1879600	which means I have to delete my MP3 files for one of my favorite racing games,
1879600	1880600	Excite Truck.
1880600	1881600	Loki, I love the game as much as you do.
1881600	1883600	You are not alone.
1883600	1887600	Next, would you buy anything with the word strip before the title
1887600	1889600	if it were on Xbox Live Arcade?
1889600	1891600	Yes.
1891600	1894600	What if it's strip mine?
1894600	1896600	That's what I keep thinking of.
1896600	1899600	What if it's, you know, strip racing?
1899600	1901600	Or strip paint.
1901600	1905600	You know, where you go to the wall and put turpentine and shit.
1905600	1907600	Third, are you looking forward to any WiiWare games
1907600	1910600	when the service comes out next week?
1910600	1913600	I actually like Defend Your Castle way more than I ought to,
1913600	1916600	so I'll probably buy Defend Your Castle on the Wii
1916600	1919600	because that game is so much freaking hilarity on the PC,
1919600	1921600	and yeah, I know it's been out for years.
1921600	1922600	That might be.
1922600	1924600	I'm looking forward to seeing the competitive one.
1924600	1926600	And yes, I want the strong, bad Wii game.
1926600	1928600	That's going to be hilarious, but I know that's not out at launch.
1928600	1930600	That's what I want. Oh, man.
1930600	1932600	Let's see.
1932600	1934600	The chat room wants to let our e-mailer know.
1934600	1937600	BlackWolf is saying he can just delete the 1.1 channel,
1937600	1939600	and ActDeft is going to post a link in chat.
1939600	1942600	There is a way you can downgrade the photo channel from 1.1.
1942600	1945600	You can get rid of that if you want to go back to the old one.
1945600	1948600	Probably you can Google it since you're not a live listener, it sounds like.
1948600	1950600	Was this the same guy from Australia?
1950600	1952600	No, this is Katamari's Forever.
1952600	1955600	Oh, well, shit, Katamari's Forever I think is in chat right now.
1955600	1957600	Or did they leave?
1957600	1958600	Oh, I think they left.
1958600	1960600	Well, poor thing because they're about to get a link in chat.
1960600	1962600	But if they happen to be listening to the podcast,
1962600	1964600	I'm sure it's out there somewhere.
1964600	1966600	Shoot us a message. We'll find it.
1966600	1968600	ActDeft is posting a link from Joystiq,
1968600	1970600	you know, the blog with Joystiq with a Q.
1970600	1974600	It was posted on December 13th of last year if you want to go find it.
1974600	1977600	Just Google it. Photo channel downgrade, you'll find it.
1977600	1980600	Lastly, I recently bought Night's Journey of Dreams.
1980600	1986600	It's a cool and very cute game, but it suffers from simplicity.
1986600	1990600	However, the voice acting is top notch and it sort of alludes to eternity's child.
1990600	1995600	I hope to see you at the Olive Garden when the endless pasta deal comes back.
1995600	2000600	And Night's has always been simplistic in play.
2000600	2005600	However, having upgraded, you know, better voice acting is really good
2005600	2009600	because the Saturn version is like, and Claris decided that she was going to go out.
2009600	2013600	It's like they took one of their secretaries who just happened to speak English and say,
2013600	2016600	here, do this. Okay.
2016600	2018600	And yes, it had the same bad voice acting in Japan.
2018600	2021600	Sadly, that's probably how it happened.
2021600	2022600	Oh, yeah, I went and done it.
2022600	2025600	P.S. Where did Dr. Sakura get the ferret?
2025600	2028600	I haven't listened for that long and I'd like to know of its origins.
2028600	2029600	Thanks again.
2029600	2032600	It's not my ferret, but I have adopted it as my baby.
2032600	2036600	I want to say this week on the Wikia, I posted a huge,
2036600	2039600	I went to the Wikia to clear up two questions that were being asked of me.
2039600	2040600	One of them was the ferret.
2040600	2044600	No, the ferret article was wrong, so I went and posted a big old thing in the talk section,
2044600	2046600	so you can go read that.
2046600	2049600	And also on the Wikia, how OLR got its name.
2049600	2053600	Dr. Tetsuya wanted me to post a thing about that, so I posted a big old thing on that,
2053600	2056600	including why we named it that, and so on and so on.
2056600	2059600	Oh, my God.
2059600	2061600	ActDeft is also pointing a step by step.
2061600	2065600	He actually went and got a bullet point list of how you downgrade the photo channel.
2065600	2066600	So here it is.
2066600	2071600	From the main menu, go into the Wii manual, go into the Wii button,
2071600	2076600	select data management, select channels, then select photo channel 1.1.
2076600	2078600	Confirm you want to delete it.
2078600	2080600	Photo channel 1.0 will return.
2080600	2082600	There you have it.
2082600	2083600	Stuff.
2083600	2085600	A long email.
2085600	2086600	Oh, Lord.
2086600	2087600	Dun, dun, dun.
2087600	2088600	From who?
2088600	2089600	Guess who it's from.
2089600	2090600	From who?
2090600	2092600	It is from Raw Steel UT.
2092600	2093600	He must be listening tonight.
2093600	2095600	He must have heard the thing earlier, didn't he?
2095600	2096600	I don't know.
2096600	2099600	All right.
2099600	2101600	Well, read however much you want to.
2101600	2103600	Hey, guys.
2103600	2104600	Hi.
2104600	2108600	I'm a girl, so you should clarify, too.
2108600	2110600	Hey, guys and girl.
2110600	2111600	Hi, baby.
2111600	2112600	Anyway.
2112600	2115600	You really wanted him to start emailing?
2115600	2116600	Hey, baby.
2116600	2117600	No.
2117600	2118600	I was just being silly.
2118600	2122600	Rob, the heat in here is giving me a freaking migraine.
2122600	2123600	Look, you're sitting right by the fan.
2123600	2124600	I don't know what to say.
2124600	2125600	It doesn't matter.
2125600	2126600	I still have a migraine.
2126600	2127600	And the box fan is broke.
2127600	2128600	All right.
2128600	2129600	Come on.
2129600	2130600	Read the email.
2130600	2131600	He broke the box.
2131600	2134600	Just because I can't get on the chat anymore doesn't mean I can't participate.
2134600	2136600	Dude, unban him, okay?
2136600	2141600	My official decree is to freaking unban him, so do it.
2141600	2142600	Oh, snap.
2142600	2143600	Now.
2143600	2144600	All right.
2144600	2145600	There you have it.
2145600	2150600	I'd probably say more things that DMN and other game pirates don't like in these emails,
2150600	2151600	but what are they going to do?
2151600	2152600	Ban me?
2152600	2153600	Anyway.
2153600	2161600	Anyway, I wanted to start by talking about light gun games on consoles, particularly
2161600	2163600	games that use limited continues.
2163600	2167600	The problem with console ports of arcade shooters is that, by and large, they're very vanilla
2167600	2170600	ports without much consideration for the home consoles.
2170600	2176600	Obviously, you need to get the arcade mode in there, give people the option of free play,
2176600	2183600	but in order to give a balanced experience that feels like it's not being made to bilk
2183600	2188600	your ass for quarters, there needs to be a console-specific game mode.
2188600	2192600	House of the Dead 2 and Vampire Knight had cool little mode where you could find special
2192600	2198600	items that could then be equipped for use in the next playthrough.
2198600	2202600	That was a cool little beginning, but since we've seen very little progress to making
2202600	2211600	console-specific experiences, however, two games that have been released recently show
2211600	2213600	a way for console light gun games to work.
2213600	2218600	First, we have Time Crisis 4 Complete Mission Mode.
2218600	2223600	In between the FPS stages, players will play through the arcade stages, but there is a
2223600	2225600	difference in how they work versus the arcade mode.
2225600	2228600	The player starts each stage with four units of life regardless of their health at the
2228600	2230600	end of the previous stage.
2230600	2233600	Upon death, the stage starts at the very beginning.
2233600	2236600	They can, however, retry as many times as they like.
2236600	2241600	This makes the game challenging without being a cheap exercise in credit draining.
2241600	2244600	Another game is Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles.
2244600	2248600	This game has a checkpoint at the center of the stage and at the final boss, and items
2248600	2252600	found in the game can be used immediately or stored for later use.
2252600	2258600	One can only hope that more light gun games will provide more robust experiences.
2258600	2261600	Did he use robust?
2261600	2265600	Because just the arcade game isn't enough.
2265600	2267600	Remember, you can't spell robust without Rob.
2267600	2269600	Or bust.
2269600	2271600	Like Robobust.
2271600	2273600	More email.
2273600	2274600	More email!
2274600	2275600	Fine!
2275600	2279600	Next, I saw something on Kotaku regarding the obscene amount of time it takes to quit
2279600	2281600	the PC versions of Assassin's Creed.
2281600	2284600	It took a full minute to quit the game using the in-game menus.
2284600	2288600	Granted, you can control alt-delete and quit that way, but seeing just how asinine
2288600	2293600	the in-game quit ordeal is really cast doubt over Ubi's willingness to cater to the PC
2293600	2299600	crowd, especially with the continued downfall of the PC as a mainstream gaming platform
2299600	2304600	i.e. retail games and not ad-supported casual stuff.
2304600	2314600	And it's at Kotaku.com slash 384339 slash Assassins dash Creed dash I dash can't dash quit dash U.
2314600	2316600	I think that's pretty freakin' funny.
2316600	2322600	Next, I have to talk about the Perfect 10 review IGN gave GTA IV, which was coincidentally
2322600	2325600	an exclusive first review.
2325600	2331600	First off, one has to question the ethical integrity of an exclusive review.
2331600	2334600	We don't hear about exclusive music or movie previews.
2334600	2335600	It just doesn't happen.
2335600	2336600	Why?
2336600	2340600	Because the music and movie reviews tend to have more integrity than much of the gaming
2340600	2342600	enthusiast media.
2342600	2354600	Indeed, I've never seen an exclusive review that wasn't a glowing puff piece for the game
2354600	2355600	in question.
2355600	2360600	And the reviewer in this case made it obvious, with hyperbole like calling it the best game
2360600	2365600	in a decade and proclaiming it to be perfect.
2365600	2371600	I can imagine the guy writing the review on his knees while his mouth was otherwise occupied.
2371600	2374600	Considering Loki's criticism of the soundtrack, Jamie's complete disinterest in the boring
2374600	2380600	monotony, and both Loki and Rob saying that the cheats are what make GTA fun, it really
2380600	2384600	looks like Rockstar is buying reviews, or at least like many reviewers are mystified
2384600	2390600	by the uber popular franchise and not wanting to believe they're even the slightest thing
2390600	2392600	wrong with it.
2392600	2394600	You know what, I just want to jump in here.
2394600	2398600	I actually really agree with what he's saying here, because I think it is absolute bullshit
2398600	2403600	that IGN gets this exclusive review, and coincidentally it gets a 10 out of 10.
2403600	2407600	Now, I think we all knew Grand Theft Auto was going to get stellar reviews across the
2407600	2413600	board, but quite frankly, IGN's word is tarnished, period, from this.
2413600	2419600	If you get an exclusive review from a company and all this stuff, of course you're going
2419600	2420600	to say good things about it.
2420600	2421600	You know what I mean?
2421600	2423600	Well, and I wouldn't really say that it's exclusive.
2423600	2426600	I mean, a lot of people shared the 10 out of 10, and to be honest, I think the official
2426600	2432600	Xbox magazine had a 10 out of 10 review way before this, but I don't know.
2432600	2437600	The whole rating system is kind of skewed anyways, and really what you need to do is
2437600	2440600	just ignore the ratings and just read what they write, because they'll explain in the
2440600	2444600	review that it's not perfect and that there's issues and stuff, and that's really what you
2444600	2445600	need to take.
2445600	2447600	You don't buy your game based off of a number review.
2447600	2453600	It's just like if you scored a B on a test or something, well, what's more important,
2453600	2456600	the fact that you scored a B or why you scored a B on the test?
2456600	2460600	I mean, that's what's more important, I would think, to an individual.
2460600	2463600	And the other thing, too, is a lot of people are skewed.
2463600	2468600	I mean, there's a lot of Grand Theft Auto fanboys out there, and I'll be first to say
2468600	2475600	I love the game, and I absolutely think it's not perfect, but it's, I mean, what do you
2475600	2476600	expect?
2476600	2483600	It's basically as much of a jump from Grand Theft Auto 3 to 4 as it was from 2 to 3, and
2483600	2486600	that was pretty big, so it's great.
2486600	2488600	It's what it needs to go, but you know what?
2488600	2492600	When they do come out with the next Vice City or whatever that is using the same engine,
2492600	2497600	it's going to be that much better, so I don't know.
2497600	2499600	But yeah, exclusive of anything is retarded.
2499600	2503600	Well, there was more to that paragraph.
2503600	2507600	The lack of balls in mainstream gaming media is frighteningly familiar to anyone who remembers
2507600	2512600	the gaming industry crash of 1983, when people started buying video games in general because
2512600	2515600	even shitty games were getting glowing reviews.
2515600	2520600	Hopefully the growth of independent media such as All Games Radio will stem the tide
2520600	2524600	of consumer distrust before the industry explodes.
2524600	2532600	Lastly, while the Nintendo Wii is still selling like crazy, attach rates are still lower than
2532600	2536600	either other console, and third parties are increasingly looking at the Wii as nothing
2536600	2538600	more than a disposable toy.
2538600	2543600	GameStop can't keep Wiis in stock, but have huge piles of accessories, and the only consistent
2543600	2546600	sellers are Wii Play and Nintendo mascot games.
2546600	2550600	Nintendo can make all the money they want, but they've not achieved their alleged goal
2550600	2552600	of increasing the market.
2552600	2556600	Some gamers still aren't buying games, and the gamers who aren't Nintendo fanboys are
2556600	2560600	increasingly dissatisfied with the system, yours truly while still UT.
2560600	2564600	This letter brought to you by Taco Bell, home of the never-ending diarrhea.
2564600	2568600	I do agree that they haven't really expanded much beyond, because they were trying to get
2568600	2572600	out of the whole rut that the GameCube is just a game for kids.
2572600	2578600	Well, the fact that they're releasing kid games all across, and I...
2578600	2584600	Okay, so they released Metroid Prime 3, but big deal, one game out of, you know, I don't
2584600	2588600	know how many they've made, that doesn't really count.
2588600	2593600	And yeah, they are targeting, you know, the casual player and stuff with these, you know,
2593600	2597600	like Wii Fit, and, you know, just the Wii console, and Wii Sports and everything, and
2597600	2601600	so yeah, there's a lot of people that will buy it just for Wii Sports, and that's it.
2601600	2605600	And they've sold, you know, they've profited from that maybe about ten bucks, you know,
2605600	2609600	because they're probably making some money off each console, but that's it.
2609600	2612600	And you know, then they're getting people to buy accessories and stuff, and there's,
2612600	2616600	you know, a lot of markup there too, so it's just retarded.
2616600	2619600	I think it's important to remember, not that I'm trying to make excuses for the Wii, because
2619600	2623600	the Wii certainly has its shortcomings, you know, especially as we've kind of moved on
2623600	2628600	a year past its launch and so on, or almost two years getting there, is that the Wii doesn't
2628600	2633600	lose money with every sale, whereas PlayStation 3 loses quite a bit of money, and Xbox 360
2633600	2637600	I think now about breaks even, but when it was first out it was losing money too, so
2637600	2642600	they have to sell more games to kind of make a profit, but Nintendo Wii, they're profiting
2642600	2646600	right out the gate, so kind of like Logie says, you just buy it for Wii Sports, there's
2646600	2650600	still a profit to be made, but I think as long as Nintendo puts out those, you know,
2650600	2654600	one, two games a year that you just have to freaking have, the soccer moms, and I think
2654600	2660600	Wii Fit is this year's, it's still going to be a big deal.
2660600	2666600	So, you know, but again, it's just a different audience than the hardcore gamer, so if Nintendo
2666600	2672600	wants to appeal to the hardcore gamer, I guess we get Metroid Prime 3, Mario Kart's not bad,
2672600	2674600	you know, there's some of those games.
2674600	2678600	I just don't think, but here's my problem with Nintendo is I don't think they get the
2678600	2685600	market still, even though they may, you know, they're in theory tapping parts of the market
2685600	2691600	that, you know, haven't been tapped before, like the casual gamer and stuff, maybe you
2691600	2695600	shouldn't be tapping that market because it's not profitable for you, you're selling tons
2695600	2698600	of consoles, but these people aren't buying, you know, games.
2698600	2703600	It's also the same problem with Sony, you're selling a Playstation 3 as a Blu-ray player,
2703600	2708600	well these people may not buy games either, so now you're losing money on that sale, but
2708600	2711600	you're not necessarily making it up in Blu-ray sales.
2711600	2715600	Keep in mind also Nintendo is a Japanese company, Microsoft is an American company, and while
2715600	2719600	yes, Sony is a Japanese company as well, you kind of get the feeling that there's a little
2719600	2723600	bit of tug-of-war going on between their American and Japanese arms as to, you know, who's controlling
2723600	2725600	the Playstation 3, you know what I mean?
2725600	2730600	So, it's something else to consider as well, because definitely you have a vastly different
2730600	2733600	audience when you talk about the Japanese gaming audience, and the American gaming audience
2733600	2736600	just look at any top 10 chart from a week, and there you have it.
2736600	2740600	And I mean, the same I guess could be said for the DS, because the Nintendo-made games
2740600	2744600	tend to sell very well, and there are, it's starting to come around for third-party stuff,
2744600	2748600	and I think it's going to come around eventually for the Wii as well, because I mean the Wii's
2748600	2756600	only been out for, you know, not that long, so, I mean, sure there's a ton of crappy ports,
2756600	2761600	just like there was a ton of crappy Xbox ports for the Xbox 360 when it first came out, and
2761600	2766600	there was a ton of crappy Playstation 1 ports for, you know, the Playstation 2 when it first came out.
2766600	2772600	But it's that Fantavision. Fantavision was fun, I liked Fantavision.
2772600	2779600	I don't know. But, you know, stuff will get better, and people, unfortunately, you know,
2779600	2783600	people understand that there are shovelware games out there, and you know what, the best
2783600	2786600	thing you can do is just not buy them, you know, granted there are stupid people that
2786600	2788600	will buy them, but that's fine, that's who they're catered to.
2788600	2791600	There will always be the Walmart crowd that buys them because they're cheap.
2791600	2795600	Exactly, but that's fine, those companies are there, you know, it's pretty funny though,
2795600	2800600	because we had some of the publishers out, and there were some publishers that deal in
2800600	2805600	specifically, you know, I want to say it was Destiny, but I'm not sure, but they're a
2805600	2810600	company that dealt with, like, really small games that, you know, didn't really do that
2810600	2814600	well, and they understand where their market is, they understand that they're not trying
2814600	2818600	to compete with, like, Grand Theft Auto, they're competing, you know, they're basically
2818600	2821600	just putting them out there because they sell, and that's it.
2821600	2825600	So, you know, they understand that their games aren't that quality, but they accept them
2825600	2829600	for what they are, so it's just people that are dumbing to buy them.
2829600	2832600	Alright, let's move on, that was the end of the email, are there any more emails?
2832600	2835600	No, no, no, there were two more.
2835600	2836600	Okay.
2836600	2843600	Hey, OLR, Hope Sky and the Fair are okay, I just thought I'd say, since I started to
2843600	2847600	listen to OLR episode 245, the show has changed so much, and you can use Studio and the
2847600	2851600	All Games move, OLR just getting bigger and better, congrats.
2851600	2859600	I should be live for once as I live in the UK, so keep an eye out, as it won't happen
2859600	2862600	again for a while, and that's from Lichen, that's in the chat room right now.
2862600	2864600	They are in chat, awesome.
2864600	2865600	Last email!
2865600	2869600	I just wanted to say, that person did kind of put it into perspective, there has been
2869600	2873600	a lot of changes to the show just in the past year, so it's pretty exciting.
2873600	2877600	Soon the world.
2877600	2879600	Last email.
2879600	2881600	Dun dun dun.
2881600	2886600	Hi, OLR, I have been really bored because I forced myself to stop Crysis.
2886600	2890600	I've been playing other games right now, like Ragnarok 2, but I think it hates Vista,
2890600	2896600	what doesn't, so it gives me a BSOD, to translate a blue screen of death.
2896600	2901600	I have a bit of money, so I want a PS2 game for my new PS2, and I recommend games for
2901600	2903600	an RPG fan, not Kingdom Hearts, period.
2903600	2908600	I already own Kingdom Hearts 1, Ace Combat 5, Tony Hawk's Project 8, Game of Pure Fail.
2908600	2915600	Some PC games would do, but it can be a shooter, no Valve games, I'd rather RPGs.
2915600	2920600	Honestly, Kingdom Hearts 2 is much better than Kingdom Hearts 1, but if you want RPG,
2920600	2925600	give Final Fantasy X or X-2, I mean those were fairly solid.
2925600	2927600	Those were good.
2927600	2931600	12 was great.
2931600	2933600	I played 12 and I did not like the battle system at all.
2933600	2936600	There's people up and down screaming, you gotta get Persona 3.
2936600	2938600	Yeah, Persona 3.
2938600	2945600	Disgaea, if you like tactical games.
2945600	2947600	I'm trying to think of what the new...
2947600	2952600	It's not really an RPG, but the Fatal Frame games were getting some...
2952600	2955600	have a little bit of a fan falling behind them too.
2955600	2959600	This is from SakuraiMax, dragging misery into my life.
2959600	2963600	I hope all the idiots who exist in my life would just go away.
2963600	2965600	Okay, I'm not going to read the rest of that, that's emo.
2965600	2967600	PS, Drip Lounge Radio.
2967600	2970600	PSS Orange Lounge Radio, it's better than Crysis.
2970600	2973600	Indeed, it is better than Crysis.
2973600	2977600	Now we're done with emails.
2977600	2979600	Yar.
2979600	2984600	Oh, I got one more mention from Royal Steel UT.
2984600	2985600	Oh, how long is it?
2985600	2986600	Not long.
2986600	2987600	Alright, hurry.
2987600	2991600	Sorry guys, but with my banning from chat, I can't respond fast to the topics I like.
2991600	2993600	Just some quick things though.
2993600	2997600	In the US, fansubbing is still illegal as it violates the original rights holders.
2997600	2999600	In this case, Japanese anime makers.
2999600	3005600	Companies like Media Factory Incorporated have sent cease and desist orders to torrent sites carrying fansubs of their anime.
3005600	3011600	And we've seen an increase in recent years of pre-licensed anime such as Ghost of the Shell Standalone Complex.
3011600	3015600	In some cases even funded in part by US companies like ADV and Manga Entertainment.
3015600	3022600	Japanese companies are obviously discontent with fansubbers as they devalue a license and are also available for Japanese users.
3022600	3024600	The internet being what it is.
3024600	3032600	JSRAC is a company formed by such anime companies and have frequently had problems with YouTube over the fansub content of their service.
3032600	3037600	As for the sequel to Rival Schools, while it is still called Project Justice Rival Schools 2 in Latin American Europe,
3037600	3041600	the subtitle Rival Schools 2 was removed from the American A.I. I knew that.
3041600	3047600	Presumably not to cause controversy two years after the Columbine Massacre in Japan, it was referred to as Moru Justice Gakuen, which is what I said.
3047600	3053600	And that's the name I still mostly refer to it by because I had the Japanese version for a long, long time.
3053600	3055600	So yeah.
3055600	3056600	Done!
3056600	3060600	If you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
3060600	3062600	Meanwhile, more gaming news!
3062600	3070600	Yes. There's going to be a brand new game. Actually, this looks pretty awesome. I've got one on order for myself and I'm not really into racing games.
3070600	3079600	But, Grid, the brand new game from Codemasters. You may remember them doing Dirt, which is a pretty well accepted game.
3079600	3085600	This time, you know, it's going to be all street racing and, well, street circuits and that kind of stuff.
3085600	3089600	It is pretty cool though. They're going to have integration with eBay Motors.
3089600	3096600	So you can actually, I guess, sell vehicles that you have created in-game through eBay.
3096600	3101600	I don't know how that's actually going to work though if you're going to have to pay real money for it.
3101600	3107600	It says, well, it's going to allow players to buy and sell in-game vehicles in a realistic setting.
3107600	3115600	And it says also they're going to have different eBay sponsor races like the eBay Motor Muscle Series.
3115600	3124600	They're going to have, let's see, some other concept cars and stuff like that with eBay stuff plastered all over it.
3124600	3129600	It doesn't really say though that they're going to be using real money.
3129600	3133600	So I'm not sure if it's just using eBay with some fictional money or what's going on there.
3133600	3139600	God, I hope it's not real eBay. As if there wasn't enough shit on eBay. Really.
3139600	3142600	You could actually probably buy shit on eBay.
3142600	3144600	I could find out.
3144600	3150600	No, it's probably against their terms of service, but that doesn't mean there isn't one for sale that's waiting to get taken down.
3150600	3155600	I mean, once in a while I'll go on eBay and search for souls, people selling their soul on eBay.
3155600	3158600	And there's usually a couple to be found even though you can't sell those.
3158600	3160600	All right, moving on to something.
3160600	3167600	I guess the ticket redemption industry probably sold their soul to the devil to chew real arcade games out of arcades.
3167600	3169600	But I thought this was kind of interesting.
3169600	3178600	There is a new bill in South Carolina that Representative Todd Rutherford has brought to light that deals with ticket redemption games and illegal gambling.
3178600	3181600	But it's not what you think. Here's the thing.
3181600	3184600	The sponsor of the bill, he calls it the Chuck E. Cheese bill.
3184600	3191600	And what it is is that right now a game like skeeball or a type of video game, it might violate the law.
3191600	3198600	However, what he wants to do is he actually wants to clearly state that these games do not violate the gambling law, that they're okay.
3198600	3207600	So it's actually, you know, usually when we talk about, you know, game related bills going into effect, we're talking about some type of extreme ass hattery.
3207600	3209600	But in this case, I guess it makes sense.
3209600	3212600	You know, it's just kids messing around. They don't want to consider it gambling.
3212600	3220600	They don't expect any opposition because, you know, the bill is simply saying that children's games at Chuck E. Cheese are not illegal.
3220600	3228600	That doesn't change the fact, though, that, you know, these games at Chuck E. Cheese is one thing.
3228600	3233600	But these games, having taken over my favorite arcades of yesteryear, are another.
3233600	3242600	And it kind of ticks me off. I don't know about you guys, but I'm a little bit pissed off that ticket redemption games have overtaken arcades I used to know and love and shed other ones out of business.
3242600	3245600	And hence, that's why I think it's time to do the FUs of the week.
3245600	3267600	My FU is to these stupid people.
3267600	3278600	And I know I always do talk about, you know, traffic and stupid people driving, but this couple in a big mini, it's not really mini.
3278600	3280600	It's just a van.
3280600	3285600	We're turning around where you cannot do a U-turn and so turned into the next street and did a wide loop.
3285600	3290600	So I was like, fuck you, you have to wait since they're technically in a right hand turning lane now.
3290600	3294600	And I went and honked at them quite loudly. Stupid bitch.
3294600	3298600	And also FU to the heat.
3298600	3303600	I mean, it's not very hot right now and it was really nice outside, but the sun specifically.
3303600	3305600	FU, sun!
3305600	3309600	You need to get a really big rock and throw it at the sun.
3309600	3311600	Little bit of tan.
3311600	3315600	Or a burn. Loki.
3315600	3319600	I don't have any FUs this week.
3319600	3321600	I guess.
3321600	3328600	Okay, I got one. FU to Burger King for coming out with the Deluxe Steakhouse Burger.
3328600	3334600	Because I understand as cool of an idea as it sounds like on paper, it really is not a very good burger.
3334600	3338600	I mean, it's got, what, you know, steak, like onions.
3338600	3345600	But where they go wrong with it is that it has mashed potatoes on the burger.
3345600	3347600	You should do that in elementary school.
3347600	3349600	That sounds nasty.
3349600	3351600	If you tried it, it wasn't very good.
3351600	3354600	But the Steakhouse Burger itself was good. Just don't go Deluxe.
3354600	3356600	Or if you do, minus mashed potatoes.
3356600	3360600	It sounds more like a Shepherd's Pie Burger.
3360600	3364600	Because potatoes are good on a Shepherd's Pie, but I wouldn't...
3364600	3367600	They do that with their breakfast burgers. They have one with hash browns on it.
3367600	3370600	Which hash browns aren't so bad because it's got that crunchy outside to it.
3370600	3373600	But mashed potatoes, it's just weird.
3373600	3374600	It's not... no.
3374600	3378600	I need to put my french fries on my hamburger.
3378600	3382600	You cannot take a meal, put it between buns, and call it a fucking burger.
3382600	3383600	It just doesn't work.
3383600	3385600	If you've got this beef in there, you can.
3385600	3388600	Misty, by the way, is in chat, and she's a BK expert of sorts.
3388600	3390600	She says, I agree with that.
3390600	3394600	Hey, I like the potatoes. It's the meat that's fucking nasty.
3394600	3396600	No, the meat's not bad.
3396600	3398600	Try McDonald's. That shit's horrible.
3398600	3402600	Here we go again with Orange Lounge Foodio.
3402600	3407600	My FU of the Week goes to my pancreas, again, for giving me problems the past few days.
3407600	3410600	Specifically the cysts that I believe burst on my pancreas.
3410600	3411600	Ew, I know.
3411600	3413600	But think how it feels.
3413600	3417600	Just a couple days ago, which caused me to have a lot of pain.
3417600	3420600	And I'm still in pain today. It feels like there's a hole in my pancreas.
3420600	3422600	It hurts. I hate it.
3422600	3425600	And FU'd a drama in general.
3425600	3427600	I'm not talking about any chat room drama that's going on or whatever.
3427600	3431600	I'm talking about drama in my personal life because I had a lot of drama.
3431600	3433600	I had epic drama yesterday.
3433600	3438600	Epic with a capital E-P-I-C. All caps. Epic drama yesterday.
3438600	3441600	It was great.
3441600	3443600	And by great, I mean shitty.
3443600	3446600	All right.
3446600	3448600	There you have it, Chair of FUs of the Week.
3448600	3451600	Let's get back to some gaming news.
3451600	3454600	Yes, we must.
3454600	3457600	Okay. Guess what?
3457600	3459600	Arby's bought out Wendy's for real?
3459600	3460600	They did?
3460600	3462600	How did Arby's buy-
3462600	3464600	Here we go back to Orange on Radio Fudio.
3464600	3466600	Arby's bought Wendy's.
3466600	3468600	Wouldn't it be the other way around? I thought Wendy's was number three.
3468600	3470600	Shouldn't Wendy's buy Arby's?
3470600	3472600	Arby's is nastified.
3472600	3476600	Except their hash brown things are really good to dip in the cheese.
3476600	3479600	So guess what?
3479600	3480600	What?
3480600	3481600	Home.
3481600	3483600	Oh, they're trying to buy Wendy's. Sorry.
3483600	3485600	Yes, home. I'm in it.
3485600	3491600	The open beta is going to be in fall 2008.
3491600	3495600	So the closed beta has been extended.
3495600	3499600	However, Sony is going to be inviting more people to join.
3499600	3502600	So maybe they'll actually update stuff in it like they said they were.
3502600	3508600	How about they invite everyone to join and just release it?
3508600	3510600	Because I think they're still hashing out stuff.
3510600	3514600	And according to some of the updates, there haven't really been updates.
3514600	3517600	They've just been sort of sitting there going la la la.
3517600	3521600	This takes me back to what was it?
3521600	3525600	I want to say spring of 2006 when they're like,
3525600	3529600	yeah, the PlayStation 3 is coming out in spring of 2006.
3529600	3531600	Oh, wait, no, it's not.
3531600	3534600	It's coming out next year.
3534600	3537600	And hasn't home been delayed like four times now?
3537600	3538600	Yeah.
3538600	3539600	And we haven't had the boomerang.
3539600	3542600	Home spore forever, Duke Nukem, Chinese democracy.
3542600	3545600	Come on.
3545600	3549600	Well, not like we have democracy here.
3549600	3551600	Anyway.
3551600	3554600	But yeah, Sony delays.
3554600	3558600	Hey, you unplugged me, bastard.
3558600	3559600	It's all right.
3559600	3561600	It just makes my monitor go slightly dimmer.
3561600	3563600	Live radio.
3563600	3565600	I had to get up for a minute. Sorry.
3565600	3571600	So one thing that's not been delayed is any sort of sequels to Guitar Hero.
3571600	3574600	And there's more rumors now coming out about Guitar Hero 4,
3574600	3578600	including that, yes, they're going to jump on the rock band bandwagon,
3578600	3585600	adding vocals, drums, and regular download content to the next game.
3585600	3588600	One of the other things that they were saying that they want to add as well
3588600	3591600	is local content from local bands.
3591600	3595600	Although I'm assuming when they're saying local, that means major city local
3595600	3603600	and not like, I don't know, Hoboken, you know.
3603600	3607600	Whether this will happen or not, I'm sure we'll find out at E3.
3607600	3610600	And if it does, does anyone think this is sort of copying?
3610600	3613600	I mean, do we even want to go there?
3613600	3615600	No. No other game has done this before.
3615600	3619600	Well, good. It'll be the first.
3619600	3621600	I don't know.
3621600	3624600	What can they do to differentiate themselves from rock band?
3624600	3631600	Because you know that people are going to say something.
3631600	3633600	They're, I don't know.
3633600	3636600	They're going to make their drums look different.
3636600	3637600	Or not.
3637600	3638600	Here's the thing, though.
3638600	3640600	Here's the thing that is going to piss me the F off,
3640600	3643600	is that the controllers will not be compatible again.
3643600	3644600	Now, I'm telling you what.
3644600	3646600	There is going to be hell to pay from the consumers,
3646600	3648600	and one of these games is going to be out.
3648600	3650600	I mean, right now there's room for two,
3650600	3652600	but one of these games will be shut out
3652600	3655600	if they start making these controllers incompatible with each other.
3655600	3656600	Mark my words.
3656600	3657600	Well, here's the thing. Here's the thing.
3657600	3660600	The controllers were incompatible because, well,
3660600	3663600	Microsoft says all the controllers have to work with all the games, basically.
3663600	3668600	I mean, guitar games have to work with all the guitar controllers, et cetera.
3668600	3672600	So you won't ever run into that issue with the Xbox 360.
3672600	3675600	Where you will run into this issue with is the Wii, PlayStation 2,
3675600	3679600	and PlayStation 3 versions, where they just say,
3679600	3682600	where Activision's like, well, you know what?
3682600	3687600	We're just not going to license you to use these controllers to fuck off, buy ours.
3687600	3688600	I don't know.
3688600	3691600	It's just kind of lame.
3691600	3694600	It's kind of lame, but the same, I guess.
3694600	3697600	You can't just have one fighting game, one music game,
3697600	3699600	but these games are expensive.
3699600	3701600	Thank you.
3701600	3703600	I think it's a little too late.
3703600	3705600	You have to innovate or get out.
3705600	3711600	They originally were kind of trying to corner the hardcore guitar playing thing.
3711600	3714600	It's kind of like In a Groove and Dance Dance Revolution,
3714600	3716600	whereas In the Groove was more technical.
3716600	3718600	It was a lot harder.
3718600	3720600	And they're going to do stuff like that,
3720600	3722600	whereas Rock Band's more accessible.
3722600	3724600	Granted, it's really expensive to get into it,
3724600	3726600	but it's more accessible, it's easier.
3726600	3728600	And one was a giant flop,
3728600	3732600	although you have about 100 hardcore fans that will scream and bitch
3732600	3735600	and try to tell you otherwise.
3735600	3736600	Well, here's my thing.
3736600	3739600	Now, harmonix is not developing the game.
3739600	3741600	Is it going to be any good?
3741600	3745600	I don't know if Guitar Hero 3 was quite as good as Guitar Hero 2.
3745600	3748600	I'm sure there's people who will go both ways.
3748600	3751600	But the fact that they're developing entirely new stuff for it,
3751600	3754600	like some sort of singing thing and that kind of stuff,
3754600	3756600	I don't know.
3756600	3760600	And we'll harmonix Sue because they're kind of ripping them off.
3760600	3762600	But then again, Konami's been ripped off on all this stuff,
3762600	3764600	so I don't know.
3764600	3766600	When's Konami going to do something?
3766600	3768600	That's what I want to know.
3768600	3770600	They've been sitting there kind of going doo-dee-doo-doo.
3770600	3772600	They realize they missed out.
3772600	3775600	How do I mark a music game to the U.S.?
3775600	3776600	I don't know.
3776600	3778600	At least we have DDR.
3778600	3780600	Oh, goody.
3780600	3783600	Hey, one game I have not been playing enough of lately
3783600	3784600	that I really need to go back and beat
3784600	3786600	because this game was all kinds of awesome,
3786600	3788600	and I don't know why I fell out of the habit of playing.
3788600	3790600	Lost Odyssey. Awesomeness.
3790600	3792600	Lost Odyssey just got some download content.
3792600	3795600	Maybe that might motivate some people to give it another look.
3795600	3798600	It is the triple bonus pack, and it will set you back 200 points.
3798600	3800600	That's not too bad. It's about 250.
3800600	3803600	The triple bonus pack has the memory lamp,
3803600	3806600	which will allow you to watch all the past event scenes again,
3806600	3808600	which is good because Lost Odyssey,
3808600	3811600	you know, high-def cutscenes, awesomeness, good times.
3811600	3814600	Shattered Bond is a new antique
3814600	3817600	that adds another one of the dream sequences in The Lost Odyssey,
3817600	3819600	which you really have to kind of experience
3819600	3821600	a Lost Odyssey dream sequence.
3821600	3824600	It's unlike anything we've seen in gaming for a little while since Zork.
3824600	3825600	This is reading.
3825600	3828600	But it's cool. I can't explain it.
3828600	3832600	But the stories are really good.
3832600	3834600	They're really good.
3834600	3836600	Whatever. You didn't play enough of it.
3836600	3840600	Killer Machine is a new ring also that comes out with the game,
3840600	3842600	and rings are an essential part of the game.
3842600	3844600	If you play the game, you know that.
3844600	3846600	So there you have it. Download content for Lost Odyssey.
3846600	3848600	Also some other download content.
3848600	3850600	I think, what was it? Army of Two?
3850600	3852600	Got some download content this week as well.
3852600	3854600	So if you're into that game, there's some new download content
3854600	3856600	you can check out there.
3856600	3859600	600 points for the SSC challenge.
3859600	3861600	I have Army of Your Mom.
3861600	3864600	Well, Army of Me and Your Mom would be too.
3864600	3867600	You know what?
3867600	3869600	The next story makes me sad.
3869600	3870600	Why is that?
3870600	3873600	Well, it doesn't make me sad as far as their stance,
3873600	3878600	but it makes me sad for the industry in general.
3878600	3883600	There is a story run in the New York Times about Stern Pinball
3883600	3886600	being the last pinball factory left in the world.
3886600	3891600	And the president of the company, Gary Stern,
3891600	3894600	basically said that they're planning on sticking around
3894600	3897600	and that they expect the industry to rebound in the next ten years.
3897600	3902600	It's basically become more of the enthusiast's market these days.
3902600	3906600	So now that when they're selling their machines,
3906600	3909600	they're not going to arcades, they're going to people.
3909600	3914600	They're going to the people who really care about the product.
3914600	3915600	I just think it's sad.
3915600	3918600	Damn you, Williams.
3918600	3920600	I just hope it doesn't go away forever.
3920600	3921600	You know what I mean?
3921600	3924600	When you hear there's only one left, it's kind of sad.
3924600	3925600	Well, they've got the market.
3925600	3926600	The end of an era.
3926600	3929600	Hey, you know what I was reading up on that I really want to go to this year?
3929600	3931600	The spiral table they did was good.
3931600	3932600	California Extreme.
3932600	3933600	I've got to make sure I go this year.
3933600	3934600	Oh, I love California Extreme.
3934600	3935600	I know.
3935600	3940600	Pinna-Go-Go is, I won't be going to it this year because I'll have company.
3940600	3941600	Oh, sad.
3941600	3943600	But Pinna-Go-Go is Memorial Day weekend.
3943600	3944600	Oh, fun.
3944600	3947600	I think I actually have Memorial Day weekend free this year.
3947600	3950600	Oh, yeah, because Fond of May isn't happening for us this year.
3950600	3951600	We're sitting out this year.
3951600	3954600	So maybe I'll go to that instead.
3954600	3955600	We'll see.
3955600	3956600	Dan, where are we going?
3956600	3958600	We'll see.
3958600	3960600	Penny Arcade Expo, by the way,
3960600	3963600	as long as my medical issues pull through, I'm going,
3963600	3968600	which means, you know, it is the last weekend in August, Seattle.
3968600	3969600	I want to go.
3969600	3975600	And, by the way, going to be a huge conglomeration of All Games podcasters there.
3975600	3978600	Like, at least six different shows have representation, if not more.
3978600	3979600	It's going to be pretty awesome.
3979600	3980600	So, good, I hope you can go, Jamie.
3980600	3983600	I hope you can talk to wife into letting you go, Loki.
3983600	3985600	So, we'll see.
3985600	3987600	Speaking of Loki, he's got our last story for tonight.
3987600	3989600	And after that story is read, we're going to open up the Skype line,
3989600	3993600	which is available at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype,
3993600	3996600	Orange Lounge Radio.
3996600	4002600	Yes, when he's not butchering franchises or threatening Michael Bay to a fist fight,
4002600	4007600	Ui Bull is trying to hit up other franchises for movie options,
4007600	4011600	and one of those franchises happened to be World of Warcraft,
4011600	4017600	in which he, I don't know, tried to get Blizzard to allow him to create a movie for,
4017600	4022600	in which Blizzard COO Paul Sams replied,
4022600	4027600	We will not sell the movie rights, not to you, especially not to you.
4027600	4030600	Bravo!
4030600	4037600	You know, they're worried that because it's such a success online,
4037600	4042600	that a bad movie would destroy that oncoming income, perhaps, or at least tarnish it.
4042600	4046600	Good for Blizzard for realizing what epic mistake they would have made
4046600	4048600	if they'd let him direct this movie.
4048600	4051600	So, are we sure this is actually true?
4051600	4053600	I think it is.
4053600	4054600	You know, because part of me goes,
4054600	4057600	this seems like a fanboy might have said this or something, I don't know.
4057600	4060600	So, all right, well that's going to do it for tonight's stories,
4060600	4063600	until we get to last minute stories, of which I'm sure Loki has a few of tonight.
4063600	4067600	But for now, we're going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
4067600	4070600	our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4070600	4073600	Let's go to the phones and open them up, and we've got a call.
4073600	4075600	Hello, caller, are you there?
4075600	4077600	Hey, what's up, guys?
4077600	4078600	Hey, who is this?
4078600	4081600	This is Toshin from All Games and every other chat room known to man.
4081600	4085600	What's up, Toshin? You listen to pretty much all the All Games shows, don't you?
4085600	4088600	I listen to a lot of them because I'm a bored person.
4088600	4090600	That's all right. That's why it's there.
4090600	4095600	You know, some people listen to regular radio, some people listen to All Games radio, if they're cool.
4095600	4096600	Yeah.
4096600	4099600	But you've been listening to All Games for ages, haven't you?
4099600	4103600	Like, you were with them back when they were, what was that other thing, pseudo or whatever they had?
4103600	4104600	Yep.
4104600	4107600	Way back there. No, I actually skipped G4.
4107600	4108600	Wow.
4108600	4111600	But I was around back when Scott was on the East Coast and all that.
4111600	4114600	Well, that's because you're in Canada, so you kind of had to skip out on G4, right?
4114600	4118600	Yeah, I've never seen anything related to G4 ever, which is probably safer.
4118600	4119600	Ah, you ain't missin' much.
4119600	4122600	Anyhow, well, what's on your mind?
4122600	4129600	I've come into a new console called Xbox 360, and I was wondering if you could recommend me some stuff.
4129600	4136600	Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 is awesome. Are you online with your Xbox 360? Have you checked out Xbox Live Arcade yet?
4136600	4146600	I'm actually working on that as we speak. I'm on a temporary laptop because my other PC got fried over the week, so I haven't been online much, but that's a different story.
4146600	4151600	But as soon as I get it back, I'm going to definitely hit up Live, and I'm going to need some friends and all that kind of stuff.
4151600	4152600	Good times.
4152600	4153600	Good times.
4153600	4155600	Jamie's going to recommend the Orange Box for Portal.
4155600	4161600	I was going to say, on Xbox Live Arcade, you definitely want to get some stuff. You've got to get Geometry Wars. You've got to get...
4161600	4162600	Symphony of the Night.
4162600	4168600	Symphony of the Night. Oh, hell yeah. You're a music game fan, right? That's what brought you to LR in the first place, right?
4168600	4169600	Yes.
4169600	4171600	You've got to get Res HD. In fact...
4171600	4173600	Ooh, nice. I have that for my Dreamcast, too.
4173600	4178600	In fact, we still have a code for Res HD that I never gave away.
4178600	4185600	And now, if he just got an Xbox 360, he might be the one person who doesn't already have Res.
4185600	4186600	Which I don't.
4186600	4190600	I might have to give Toshin the code for Res HD.
4190600	4191600	So...
4191600	4194600	But, well, we have to make Toshin do something to earn it.
4194600	4197600	What can we make Toshin do to earn it?
4197600	4199600	I'm on the hook, am I?
4199600	4200600	You what?
4200600	4202600	I'm on the hook, am I?
4202600	4206600	Oh, Footy Monster's complaining because he doesn't have Res either.
4206600	4209600	Well, I don't know. We'll figure something out.
4209600	4213600	Toshin, you and I will have a chat offline and maybe we can hook you up with Res.
4213600	4216600	Maybe I'll have to make you and Footy Monster fight for it.
4216600	4218600	Ooh, maybe we'll make...
4218600	4220600	I'm sure. He hits his own podcast.
4220600	4226600	You know what we'll do? We'll make Footy and Toshin play a game next week on the show.
4226600	4229600	We'll get some guests and we'll play match game. Are you going to be here next week?
4229600	4230600	Up here.
4230600	4234600	Alright. We're going to get Toshin. I'll make Footy come next week.
4234600	4238600	Footy and Toshin will play epic match game.
4238600	4241600	We're going to play epic match game next week. Why is it epic?
4241600	4245600	You'll find out. I have a new idea for match game to make it epic.
4245600	4247600	So we're going to play epic match game next week.
4247600	4248600	Alright.
4248600	4249600	He's already fucking smacked me.
4249600	4251600	Anyhow.
4251600	4254600	What other types of games do you like, Toshin?
4254600	4260600	I mean, I like XBLA. I've played a couple of those games.
4260600	4265600	I like anything. I'm pretty neutral. I mean, I won't knock down a game until I've tried it.
4265600	4268600	So I'm pretty open to trying anything like RPGs.
4268600	4273600	If you like RPGs, you must, must, must get Lost Odyssey. It's amazing.
4273600	4277600	It's not getting enough buzz out there. I don't know why.
4277600	4285600	For classic RPG fans, if you like your old school RPGs from Super Nintendo and the Final Fantasy and stuff, you will love Lost Odyssey.
4285600	4287600	Okay.
4287600	4292600	Other types of games. Well, of course, Portal if you're into shooters and the Orange Box is just a great deal overall, frankly.
4292600	4295600	Loki, what about my recommendation from you?
4295600	4297600	Grand Theft Auto IV.
4297600	4299600	What's that?
4299600	4301600	I keep hearing stuff about it, though.
4301600	4303600	Never heard of it.
4303600	4304600	Alright.
4304600	4305600	I'll have to look into that one.
4305600	4310600	Well, there you have some suggestions, Toshin. Good luck to you and congratulations on your purchase.
4310600	4311600	I'll definitely check that out.
4311600	4313600	Any last thoughts for our listeners?
4313600	4320600	Um, just enjoy the weather. It's getting nice out and turn down the garage.
4320600	4326600	It is very, very hot out here right now. We're trying to enjoy it, but it's difficult when you're cooking alive out here.
4326600	4328600	So we're cooking Mama alive.
4328600	4331600	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
4331600	4332600	What was that?
4332600	4334600	Not my mom.
4334600	4336600	Alright, Toshin, we gotta let you go. Take care, buddy.
4336600	4337600	Alright, see you later.
4337600	4339600	Bye-bye.
4339600	4342600	Why is Skype acting all janky tonight?
4342600	4344600	It's acting very slow.
4344600	4345600	I don't like it.
4345600	4347600	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
4347600	4349600	Hey, it's Ronma. What's up, everyone?
4349600	4357600	Not much, although I've gotta say Skylark is like, in chat rooms, Skylark is like jumping up and down screaming Eternal Sonata, which also was a really good game.
4357600	4365600	And if you like more action-oriented RPGs, like not of the Kingdom Hearts caliber necessarily, it's just a great story.
4365600	4368600	If you like a good story, I do recommend Eternal Sonata.
4368600	4370600	Alright, what's up, Rama?
4370600	4372600	Well, a couple of things before I begin.
4372600	4378600	I'm glad that you guys finally mentioned Video Power, because every time you mention Starrcade, I'm like,
4378600	4385600	I've never seen this show, and I'm the only one that's ever seen Video Power.
4385600	4388600	I have never seen Video Power, but apparently Jamie has.
4388600	4390600	I've seen Video Power.
4390600	4392600	Really? How did I miss this show?
4392600	4401600	There was one episode where the kid had to Velcro a Nintendo Entertainment System box to his head, like he was running through a maze.
4401600	4402600	Mm-hmm.
4402600	4404600	It was funny.
4404600	4407600	Good times. Were you a contestant on Video Power or something?
4407600	4411600	No, but believe it or not, Video Power was actually two seasons.
4411600	4414600	The first season was with the kid that hosted it as a game show.
4414600	4422600	He would come in, show the Video Power cartoon, and after the end of the show, you put up either a review or a secret code, and that was it.
4422600	4427600	Then the second season was nothing but the game show aspect of it.
4427600	4434600	So it started as a game advice show, and then it morphed into a game show? That's kind of weird.
4434600	4444600	Yeah, it was sponsored by Acclaim because it was all about NARC, Quirk, Bigfoot, Arch-Vribals, all that together as a superhero team.
4444600	4447600	Whatever happened to Acclaim? Are they still around?
4447600	4448600	I don't remember that.
4448600	4449600	No, they went under.
4449600	4451600	Oh, hmm. They were big back in the day.
4451600	4453600	But they came back doing MMOs now.
4453600	4454600	Interesting.
4454600	4465600	Well, VidPowa, what other old school... We actually used to have a chatter named VidPowa now that I think about it. That's why I said it that way, because there was a chatter all the time that we had here.
4465600	4467600	I wonder if they got his name from that.
4467600	4473600	What other types of old school video game based TV shows do you remember?
4473600	4476600	I actually remembered a Qbert cartoon and Donkey Kong.
4476600	4482600	Yes. I remember the Qbert cartoon because it had the Valley Girl sort of character on there too.
4482600	4483600	Mm-hmm.
4483600	4485600	That said gag me with a rocket ship.
4485600	4487600	I remember a Pac-Man cartoon, but I don't remember Qbert.
4487600	4488600	The Pac-Man cartoons were good too.
4488600	4489600	That too.
4489600	4490600	Yeah.
4490600	4497600	I remember one year they had Pac-Man saving Santa Claus, and they played it at night, and I was so happy.
4497600	4506600	I always wanted to go on Nick Arcade, but I never did because my parents didn't take me places where I could go on. What?
4506600	4508600	I did watch Captain In and it pissed me off.
4508600	4509600	Why is that?
4509600	4513600	Because I was like, dude, these characters aren't like that. It sucks.
4513600	4516600	I loved the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.
4516600	4518600	I liked the Zelda episodes.
4518600	4520600	Yes. Zelda Fridays were always awesome.
4520600	4521600	That's all on DVD now.
4521600	4525600	I actually did like the Super Mario World one they did too. That one was pretty cool.
4525600	4527600	Mm-hmm. Good times.
4527600	4529600	And you could always do the Mario at the end of the show.
4529600	4532600	All right. Enough reminiscing. Anything else you want to share with listeners, Rama?
4532600	4534600	Skye, did you get Mario Kart Wii yet?
4534600	4536600	Did you call me Scott?
4536600	4537600	No.
4537600	4538600	I said Skye.
4538600	4540600	I was like, wrong show.
4540600	4543600	I know he's speaking New York.
4543600	4546600	Did I get Mario Kart Wii yet? I did not.
4546600	4547600	Yes.
4547600	4548600	I haven't picked it up yet.
4548600	4549600	Why not?
4549600	4553600	I spent the money on a new air conditioner for the garage today, so I'll probably get it this week.
4553600	4555600	It's a great game. I'm loving it.
4555600	4566600	I know. Loki had the advanced copy and we played it, so I got my fill of it, but I will buy the game because I do want to play online with other people, even if Toadette's in the game and I can't stand her.
4566600	4568600	It's also Baby Peach. That's not so bad.
4568600	4570600	That's true.
4570600	4575600	Loki, I want your friend code. I owe you an ass beating in Mario Kart.
4575600	4579600	I'll think about it as soon as I get online when I'm stopped, you know, playing.
4579600	4581600	God, you're lazy.
4581600	4584600	Yeah, as soon as he can tear himself away from Grand Theft Auto IV.
4584600	4586600	All right, Rama. We got to let you go to get more calls, but take care, buddy.
4586600	4587600	All right, cool. All right. Later, guys.
4587600	4588600	Later.
4588600	4589600	All right.
4589600	4594600	I know. Good luck tearing Loki away from Grand Theft Auto IV for a few days.
4594600	4599600	What the fuck is wrong with Skype today? It's running horribly on my end. At least the calls sound fine.
4599600	4601600	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?
4601600	4603600	Hey, what's up, guys? This is Footy Monster.
4603600	4606600	Well, hello, Footy Monster. So, are you going to be here next week?
4606600	4609600	Definitely. I want that free coffee for $60.
4609600	4615600	All right, all right. It's going to be you and Toshin duking it out in Epic Match Game. Just you wait.
4615600	4617600	The gloves are off.
4617600	4618600	All right.
4618600	4619600	Whatever you want to call it. Yeah.
4619600	4620600	All right. It's going to be good times.
4620600	4622600	So, what's on your mind, Footy?
4622600	4629600	Well, basically, I wanted to share with you guys what I think personally is the best RPG I've played in a long time.
4629600	4631600	Persona 3 again?
4631600	4636600	No. No. It's actually The World Ends With You for a DS that came out just last week.
4636600	4637600	Ah.
4637600	4644600	And let me tell you, it's out there with console RPGs. It's pretty fantastic.
4644600	4648600	You know, if I wasn't in such a PSP mood this week, I would have totally bought that game.
4648600	4650600	I think the soundtrack is pretty hopping.
4650600	4656600	Describe what this game is all about because I've not seen much about it except for some of the artwork and the soundtrack.
4656600	4658600	How does this game work?
4658600	4661600	Well, it has different mechanics.
4661600	4666600	Let me start by saying it's a game that can be as hardcore as you want it to be,
4666600	4671600	but at the same time it can be as simple as you want it to be, which I think is very interesting because for portable people,
4671600	4678600	especially RPG players on the go, maybe they don't want to delve too much into an RPG that's super complex,
4678600	4685600	but yet this game allows you to make it either really complex, like for instance, Shadow Slayer plays it in a really simple way,
4685600	4689600	and I've played it in a super complex way in which I do much more stuff,
4689600	4692600	yet we're both enjoying it just as much, which I thought was brilliant.
4692600	4694600	Interesting.
4694600	4699600	Like, for instance, the game works on both screens at the same time and you control two characters at the same time,
4699600	4701600	one on the bottom screen and one on the top screen.
4701600	4704600	On the bottom screen you control your styles to move and attack,
4704600	4710600	and on the top screen you move by your D-pad or if you're right-handed or left-handed with the face buttons.
4710600	4717600	And all you do, which sounds really convoluted because you had to basically work on both planes at the same time,
4717600	4721600	but the beauty is that you can actually set the other character to move automatically if you don't want to,
4721600	4725600	or maybe automatically if you don't move it by every two seconds,
4725600	4729600	so that way it gives you this freedom of like, okay, do I want to be really hardcore right now,
4729600	4734600	or do I just, I'm just playing for 30 minutes and I don't want to really buzz my head in with this?
4734600	4736600	And I thought that was pretty impressive.
4736600	4740600	Same with, on the fly, four different difficulty settings that you can change.
4740600	4744600	You can go with easy, with super easy, normal, which is okay except for the blast battle,
4744600	4748600	hard, which is always hard, and ultimate, which is impossible, basically.
4748600	4751600	You know what it reminds me of when you describe that whole character thing,
4751600	4754600	is for some reason I'm having flashbacks to Secret of Mana.
4754600	4757600	Like, remember how you could kind of customize the second and third players that you had?
4757600	4759600	You had the girl and the little sprite guy.
4759600	4762600	Like, you could kind of, you could customize the way they behaved,
4762600	4766600	but then, like, if you really wanted to, you just have a second person control the character.
4766600	4768600	Like, you could make it a two-player game.
4768600	4771600	Or if you're really hardcore, you can control them all yourself.
4771600	4775600	Right. That's kind of the thing, only that you can't really let anyone else control it.
4775600	4777600	Although I was thinking when I was playing this game with Jack,
4777600	4780600	we were thinking, dude, how awesome would it be if with Wi-Fi you could control top screen
4780600	4783600	and I could control bottom screen or, you know, vice versa.
4783600	4784600	It would be so much fun.
4784600	4788600	But this game really surprised me because I actually wrote in the audience forms
4788600	4792600	a small, like, super tiny paragraph that basically describes how I feel about this game.
4792600	4797600	Because it's, I tried to wrap it out in a way that I let people call in as well,
4797600	4800600	and not, you know...
4800600	4805600	So, if you allow me, I would like to read that, like, it's like five lines.
4805600	4806600	Sure, of course, go for it.
4806600	4809600	So, I basically, what I said is,
4809600	4811600	it's far none of the best RPG I've played in a while,
4811600	4812600	at least on portables,
4812600	4815600	Mass Effect and Persona 3 take the cake on consoles for sure,
4815600	4818600	at least in what I play lightly, right?
4818600	4822600	I was totally hooked with the story and the impressive amount of plot twists
4822600	4825600	that never seems to be interesting, which totally surprised me because
4825600	4830600	I can't remember the last time a BS game or a PSP game engaged me in that way.
4830600	4833600	In that way that I go, okay, I can't really put this down.
4833600	4835600	Like, Lost Odyssey could do with you.
4835600	4840600	That kind of commitment, which I was, it blew my mind really.
4840600	4843600	The game definitely must be played by any DS owner
4843600	4845600	just because it's really accessible as an RPG,
4845600	4847600	because you can tone everything down,
4847600	4849600	play easy, automatic on your partner,
4849600	4852600	and just never worry about anything by looking at the cool story,
4852600	4855600	or you can go all the way hardcore if you wanted to,
4855600	4857600	if you're a really avid RPG player.
4857600	4860600	And the music, as we've heard on the break today, is amazing,
4860600	4862600	and if you haven't checked it out, you need to check it out
4862600	4865600	because it's fantastic, it's out there with Persona 3,
4865600	4867600	super modern, super upbeat,
4867600	4872600	it has interesting beats that I really haven't heard in RPGs in a long time,
4872600	4876600	because RPGs today were elves in science fiction, maybe,
4876600	4878600	and Final Fantasy, and that's it.
4878600	4881600	And this modern day setting is so refreshing.
4881600	4885600	Like, you are in Shibuya, that's it, no frills, no nothing.
4885600	4887600	It's just a very stylish Shibuya, that's it.
4887600	4888600	You're in the middle of Tokyo.
4888600	4890600	Here's one question I have about the game,
4890600	4892600	because I have to admit, one of the turn-offs for the game for me
4892600	4894600	is that it's on the DS.
4894600	4898600	I don't like seeing these types of hardcore games on the DS,
4898600	4900600	because I don't know, maybe I'm just old-fashioned,
4900600	4905600	but the way I like to play my games is I like to have that big experience
4905600	4908600	on the big television and really immerse myself with everything.
4908600	4910600	I feel like I can't be as immersed in the DS.
4910600	4912600	DS is more like a casual game system for me,
4912600	4914600	and I know I need to kind of get over it.
4914600	4918600	But do you think this game might have been better if it wasn't on the DS,
4918600	4920600	if it was on the actual console?
4920600	4921600	Well, that's the thing.
4921600	4923600	That's why I'm so impressed by Square Enix here,
4923600	4925600	proving that they can do something that's not Dragon Quest
4925600	4927600	and that it's not Final Fantasy.
4927600	4930600	They made a game for the DS.
4930600	4931600	It is meant to be played with the DS,
4931600	4933600	and you can't play it on another system.
4933600	4936600	It's that simple, which I thought was brilliant.
4936600	4937600	I mean, the dual screen,
4937600	4940600	dual screens are not used to show you a map.
4940600	4942600	There's action happening on both screens at the same time.
4942600	4945600	Basically, just to explain real quick,
4945600	4947600	you're fighting enemies on the bottom screen,
4947600	4949600	and the same enemies are cloned on the top screen,
4949600	4953600	and it's kind of like fighting on a two-dual plane kind of battle.
4953600	4955600	So if you kill someone on the bottom screen,
4955600	4957600	it dies on the top screen as well,
4957600	4959600	and they share the hit points from top to bottom,
4959600	4961600	and you and your partner share the same hit points bar.
4961600	4963600	So if your partner falls,
4963600	4966600	it starts hitting out from your bottom screen life bar, basically.
4966600	4967600	It's like a vertical bar.
4967600	4968600	Interesting.
4968600	4970600	So it's a very interesting way that they've designed it.
4970600	4972600	They've decided it in a way that,
4972600	4974600	well, man, I didn't expect it.
4974600	4976600	I didn't expect Square to blow my mind,
4976600	4978600	not after what they've done lately, if you know what I mean.
4978600	4980600	They haven't really been creative,
4980600	4982600	and this is creative,
4982600	4984600	which I thought was impressive.
4984600	4985600	The combat system is steep.
4985600	4988600	The art style, oh my God, that's great.
4988600	4990600	Seriously, it's not 3D,
4990600	4993600	but it's such a good 3D that doesn't make you miss 3D.
4993600	4995600	Rave, rave, rave.
4995600	4997600	That's all you're doing about this game,
4997600	4998600	but that's great.
4998600	5000600	I'm sorry. It's really, really good.
5000600	5004600	I didn't go into the game because it looks emo-ish,
5004600	5006600	and it's not my style.
5006600	5008600	God damn it, I got into that game,
5008600	5010600	and seriously, my life was over for a week and a half.
5010600	5012600	I finished the game two days ago,
5012600	5015600	and it's one of those games that I wish I hadn't played
5015600	5016600	so I could play it again.
5016600	5017600	It's that kind of thing.
5017600	5018600	Wow. All right.
5018600	5021600	You know how Rave out Persona 3?
5021600	5022600	I never actually finished Persona 3.
5022600	5023600	I got pranked out.
5023600	5025600	This one, I'm not getting pranked out.
5025600	5027600	And there's a lot of stuff to do after the game's over,
5027600	5029600	which I think is really interesting as well.
5029600	5030600	There's a lot of stuff to do.
5030600	5032600	It's interesting because with Grand Theft Auto IV
5032600	5034600	kind of taking all the headlines this week,
5034600	5036600	it's really interesting that a game like this
5036600	5038600	might kind of slip under the radar
5038600	5040600	that people may kind of miss out on.
5040600	5042600	So if you're listening to this program...
5042600	5045600	I'm getting GTA IV myself,
5045600	5047600	and I'm glad that I actually put the time,
5047600	5049600	since the game came out,
5049600	5051600	to play it before this game came out
5051600	5053600	because I probably would have lost it otherwise.
5053600	5058600	So that's why we dedicated last week's review to that game.
5058600	5060600	We did a totally in-depth review,
5060600	5061600	and I can't recommend it enough.
5061600	5062600	That's why I wanted to come on your show, guys,
5062600	5064600	because I know there's a lot of RPG listeners here,
5064600	5065600	and you as well.
5065600	5067600	I mean, you guys play RPGs as well.
5067600	5068600	So I wanted you to guys...
5068600	5070600	You need to check this out before GTA comes in
5070600	5071600	and steals your lives.
5071600	5072600	That's what I'm saying.
5072600	5073600	Too late for Loki,
5073600	5075600	but there's still hope for me and Jamie.
5075600	5077600	So if you're listening to this program,
5077600	5080600	Footie demands that you put down Grand Theft Auto
5080600	5082600	and check out The World Ends With You if you own DS.
5082600	5083600	And I will.
5083600	5085600	I promise you I'll check it out soon.
5085600	5086600	Good stuff.
5086600	5087600	All right.
5087600	5088600	Footie, we've got to let you go take more calls,
5088600	5089600	but have a good one, okay, buddy?
5089600	5090600	No worries.
5090600	5091600	See you guys later.
5091600	5092600	All right, later.
5092600	5096600	That was a very, very strongly worded recommendation
5096600	5097600	for The World Ends With You.
5097600	5099600	So, you know, I've been hearing a lot of good things
5099600	5100600	about that game.
5100600	5101600	I'm going to pick it up.
5101600	5102600	Yeah, I think I want to too.
5102600	5105600	Or I'll just wait until you get it and get sick of it
5105600	5106600	and I'll borrow yours.
5106600	5109600	We'll see what happens.
5109600	5111600	Okay, let's take one more call.
5111600	5112600	Why not?
5112600	5113600	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5113600	5114600	Who's this?
5114600	5117600	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.
5117600	5119600	Your fearless webmaster has arrived.
5119600	5124600	Well, hello, VXZXWQ Jason XQWV.
5124600	5125600	Okay, you fail.
5125600	5126600	You're done.
5126600	5127600	I'm just kidding.
5127600	5128600	What's up?
5128600	5129600	You fail.
5129600	5130600	Failed.
5130600	5135600	I'm trying to decide what exactly I think of custom peripherals on the Wii.
5135600	5141600	I caught the latter half of Bobby's show and was listening, of course,
5141600	5147600	to his complaints about the real power controls with the Mario Kart Wii wheel
5147600	5152600	and then Loki's earlier rant about the silly extensions for the baseball game
5152600	5156600	that just puts the Wii out another foot so you can crack that priceless base
5156600	5163600	and kill your TV even quicker when you let go on accident and it flails away.
5163600	5167600	There was a long, long, long ago wish list that I had
5167600	5171600	and one of those was Fatal Frame moving to Nintendo.
5171600	5174600	I always, and I think I still do believe this,
5174600	5178600	that the best – I need to take a step back.
5178600	5180600	I'm failing.
5180600	5185600	One of the things that I've always wanted to do is have a camera to play Fatal Frame
5185600	5189600	and have it translate to the character controls in game.
5189600	5193600	They never did that on the PS2 or Xbox, obviously,
5193600	5198600	and apparently the fourth incarnation is coming to the Wii,
5198600	5202600	when I'm not entirely sure, but I was reading that the other day.
5202600	5209600	And I'm just trying to decide what worth a camera clamshell would be for the Wiimote
5209600	5211600	or if it would be better as a dedicated controller
5211600	5215600	or if the whole thing is just bumpkits and you should use the normal controller anyways.
5215600	5217600	Here's my question.
5217600	5220600	What having that extra clamshell and that extra stuff,
5220600	5224600	what exactly does that bring to the experience?
5224600	5226600	It would be the feeling.
5226600	5228600	It would be the immersion.
5228600	5232600	It would be the fact that you're not just pointing and changing channels on your TV.
5232600	5237600	I mean, that's what the whole concept around this has been.
5237600	5241600	It's been the attempt at immersion when the thing is impossible to do
5241600	5244600	or when there may be situations that prevent you from doing it, i.e.,
5244600	5248600	you don't golf in the rain or in the lightning storm in the snow.
5248600	5251600	You don't drive off-road at 100 miles in a while.
5251600	5253600	Maybe some people do, but they're just nuts.
5253600	5258600	And you can't go around taking pictures of maniacal spirits that want to kill you.
5258600	5261600	I've got to ask Loki what you think about that
5261600	5266600	because you're a big anti-Wii peripheral person.
5266600	5271600	Do you think that there are some games that might justify these different peripherals
5271600	5274600	besides maybe just Wii Fit where that kind of is the game?
5274600	5279600	For instance, Jason's example is Fatal Frame with an actual clamshell camera.
5279600	5285600	Do you think that there's other types of games that maybe can justify the silly controllers?
5285600	5288600	If it uses it in an interesting way.
5288600	5293600	I've seen some... this is kind of like the middle ground, I would say.
5293600	5297600	There was a game called Hooked Real Motion Fishing.
5297600	5300600	And what it was is it was a clamshell that held the remote in,
5300600	5304600	and then there was the reel that held the nunchuck in.
5304600	5309600	So you had to use the actual reel like you're reeling in a fish.
5309600	5313600	Granted, you could probably do that without the actual clamshell,
5313600	5316600	but it still was using it to something...
5316600	5321600	It's not as simple as just Mario Kart pretending it's a wheel.
5321600	5326600	You can tilt the remote without the steering wheel attachment.
5326600	5329600	Or even worse, with the baseball thing.
5329600	5333600	You can play Wii Baseball without having that on there.
5333600	5337600	People say, oh yeah, you can weight it and stuff, so it feels more natural.
5337600	5339600	But yeah, then you can hit stuff and break it.
5339600	5342600	But as far as if they came out with something that...
5342600	5347600	It would be hard for them to do it, I guess, because of the infrared and stuff.
5347600	5351600	However you would do that, it would be really weird.
5351600	5355600	But if they could pull it off in a way that was interesting, then maybe, yeah, that would be worth it.
5355600	5358600	But a lot of these things are just...
5358600	5364600	It's basically aimed at the people that will only buy the Wii for Wii Sports.
5364600	5369600	So they're like, oh hey, now I can add this tennis racket thing and it looks like I'm really playing tennis.
5369600	5374600	It's just for the simple-minded, I guess. I don't know.
5374600	5378600	Simple-minded. Very nice.
5378600	5382600	The bridge version of what I was going to say is that on the one hand, I love the Super Scope 6.
5382600	5385600	Absolutely. Games were fantastic.
5385600	5389600	But it was so short-lived and you can't really reuse it.
5389600	5392600	But on the flip side, I just want to play Fatal Frame with the camera.
5392600	5398600	And thinking about that, I just had what probably amounts to one of the better ideas that cost way too damn much.
5398600	5404600	I'm sorry, I have to interrupt and go back to the camera because the chat room is so winter.
5404600	5408600	They said not only could that camera be used for Fatal Frame,
5408600	5417600	but the clamshell camera could also be used to play the OLR dream game WhatTheyPlay.com Snap from last week's show.
5417600	5423600	The other inspiration was Pokemon Snap 2, so believe me, I completely understand.
5423600	5425600	Winner. Sorry, Jason.
5425600	5428600	All three games we found a use for the camera.
5428600	5433600	This is probably the most infeasible thing to do for cost, but this would be freaking awesome.
5433600	5437600	The reason why I would want a camera is I would want an external screen.
5437600	5442600	These cameras have viewfinders, they have the LCD screen and all that kind of stuff on it.
5442600	5450600	It would be interesting to have a rigging where the Wiimote plugs into the Nintendo DS and the DS becomes your viewfinder.
5450600	5455600	That way you have Fatal Frame on screen, but since you cannot at least,
5455600	5458600	they have no better way to represent this than the PS2 version,
5458600	5461600	you cannot see the ghost's blind eye, naked eye.
5461600	5463600	You can through the viewfinder.
5463600	5469600	With your DS, it shows you the same thing your character would be seeing in the environment based off where you're pointed on on the TV,
5469600	5476600	but you will only be able to see the ghost and battle it through the DS screen, at least accurately anyway.
5476600	5482600	That would be the funnest game I have ever played, swear to God.
5482600	5487600	But it's probably not going to happen because that's been too damn intricate.
5487600	5490600	Too damn intricate, sadly.
5490600	5495600	A kid can dream, but oh man.
5495600	5502600	I guess the end result of all this is that one-off and small-use peripherals will continue to come around,
5502600	5506600	they will attempt to find reuse in which they will fail, they will fade into obscurity,
5506600	5509600	and people will reminisce like we do the Super Scope.
5509600	5511600	And the Virtual Boy.
5511600	5517600	Alright, Jason, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for the call.
5517600	5518600	Of course.
5518600	5520600	Take care, buddy. And I hope you get your dream game.
5520600	5522600	Alright, bye-bye.
5522600	5526600	That would be a very expensive setup though, but I mean, it sounds pretty cool.
5526600	5528600	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight, guys.
5528600	5531600	Sorry to those who didn't get through, but we've got to wrap it up.
5531600	5535600	We have kind of a long show, we still have a post-show live thing to do.
5535600	5542600	So, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, but before I do that, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?
5542600	5545600	Sure, I have a few, I guess.
5545600	5550600	There's a game coming out that's got a great name, so I think it's worth checking it out.
5550600	5556600	It's a RTS game called Stalin vs. the Martians.
5556600	5564600	And basically you play Joseph Stalin, and you have to save Russia from Martians.
5564600	5572600	And it's kind of like a real-time strategy game, looks similar to maybe Civilization or something like that.
5572600	5576600	Interesting name, though.
5576600	5578600	Let's see here.
5578600	5590600	Apparently, our friend Lord Voldemort is on a road trip now to remove Grand Theft Auto 4 ads from US transit lines.
5590600	5596600	And apparently he has sent emails to Miami Mayor Carlos Alvarez saying,
5596600	5607600	Grand Theft Auto games have been obsessively played by a number of teens who have then copy-catted the outrageous sociopathic violence in the games and killed innocent people.
5607600	5614600	And so, he is being himself, I guess.
5614600	5616600	Now, this is actually pretty cool.
5616600	5626600	You know how they're doing Street Fighter 2 HD, which is basically an HD remix of Street Fighter, all the stuff redrawn and stuff like that?
5626600	5633600	Well, there is a homebrew project being done to do something very similar to Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
5633600	5634600	Nice.
5634600	5639600	They're redrawing all the characters, and it looks pretty good so far, with new sprites.
5639600	5644600	They're going to add MP3 music to it, true 3D special stages.
5644600	5649600	And then, I guess, a bunch more stuff.
5649600	5652600	256 colors with one alpha channel and all sorts of fun.
5652600	5653600	I'd buy that.
5653600	5655600	That sounds awesome.
5655600	5658600	That's what the Sonic 2 on Xbox Live should have been in the first place.
5658600	5678600	Yeah. And then, apparently, you remember Ben Heck, his PlayStation 3 laptop that he made went up on auction and actually ended up selling for $9,000 online with all of the proceeds going to the National Cancer Coalition.
5678600	5680600	Alright, at least it's a good cause.
5680600	5688600	Yeah, so that's pretty awesome, but if that's not good enough, he is going to be starting much like he did with the Xbox 360.
5688600	5699600	His how-to guide, and he has the first installment in gadget right now, so you can check that out and make your own PS3 laptop if you can do that.
5699600	5703600	And that is it.
5703600	5707600	Alright, then that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.
5707600	5712600	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought, and I'll start tonight.
5712600	5715600	My final thought is, ouch, has pain.
5715600	5716600	Dr. Sankar, your final thought?
5716600	5718600	Tired, hot, headache.
5718600	5719600	Loki, your final thought?
5719600	5721600	More Grand Theft Auto 4!
5721600	5723600	I'm going to Vegas this week.
5723600	5725600	Ooh, lucky you. Lucky, lucky you.
5725600	5726600	I have to go train people.
