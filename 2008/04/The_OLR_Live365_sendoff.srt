00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
you

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,800
Orange Lounge radio will be closing after April 12th

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,060
Thanks to all who have supported us in our five and a half years of broadcasting on April 13th

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,960
Please join us in our future projects at our new home

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,960
They work in the music business march to the corporate beat

6
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,720
But after hours they go online and make radio the way they feel it should be these are DJs on live

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,280
365 VIP members have part of their fees kicked back to these broadcasters

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,680
So when you listen to these guys you tell them they're right. It's a revolution join today at live 365 comm slash VIP

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:21,380
Y365

10
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,380
Wherever you are you're gonna see me fly

11
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,380
Across the midnight sky

12
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,380
Where were you to hold my hand

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,380
To the things that we had planned

14
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,380
Yes I need you by my side

15
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,380
When things go crazy

16
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,380
I just need to know you here

17
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,380
Guarantee that you'll be there

18
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,380
When I wake up in the night

19
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,380
Will you be my guiding light

20
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,380
I don't care how far I'll take a place

21
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,380
Tonight

22
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,380
Tell me where you are and everything's gonna be alright

23
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,380
Like a shooting star

24
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,380
Across the midnight sky

25
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,380
Just to be with you tonight

26
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,380
Like a shooting star

27
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,380
Across the midnight sky

28
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:15,380
Just to be with you tonight

29
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,380
To a crazy friend

30
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,380
We wrote this song specially for you

31
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,380
It's for everything you do

32
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,380
You are the best

33
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,380
Now get undressed

34
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,380
You are the cutest

35
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,380
That's why far

36
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,380
You took a risk

37
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,380
And brought our disses

38
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,380
You play it loudly in your car

39
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,380
You tell your friends

40
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,380
What about our band

41
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,380
We're intimate

42
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,380
This is what you are

43
00:03:49,380 --> 00:04:02,380
F-U-C-E-R

44
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,380
When we play a show

45
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
It's good to know

46
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,380
You are in the crowd

47
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,380
We hear you scream so loud

48
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,380
You like to dance

49
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,380
And take a chance

50
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,380
So throw your undies on the stage

51
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,380
No wait

52
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
You're underage

53
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,380
You send us e-mail everyday

54
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,380
Sharp and touchy

55
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,380
You make your freak

56
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
So uber chic

57
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,380
You know what they're for

58
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:47,380
F-U-C-E-R

59
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,380
You're super sperm

60
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,380
And it's what you are

61
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,380
So super sperm

62
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,380
You just dance by far

63
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,380
You're super sperm

64
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,380
And it's what you are

65
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,380
So super sperm

66
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:08,380
So super sperm

67
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,380
To our future fans

68
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,380
And for our fans

69
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,380
Do you want to join our club?

70
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,380
We're on the road

71
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,380
It's super sperm

72
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
We'll just ask for one thing more

73
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,380
Come see our tour

74
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,380
You will agree

75
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,380
Let's make a long, long, long will

76
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,380
F-U-C-E-R

77
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,380
You're super sperm

78
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,380
And it's what you are

79
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,380
So super sperm

80
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,380
You just dance by far

81
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,380
This is what you are

82
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:47,380
F-U-C-E-R

83
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,380
You're super sperm

84
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,380
And it's what you are

85
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,380
You know it oh what you are

86
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,220
S U T E R

87
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,960
You're super sprung, that is what you are

88
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,400
So super sprung, Jesus plans by far

89
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,460
You're super sprung, that is what you are

90
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,820
So super sprung, Jesus plans by far

91
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,840
You're super sprung, that is what you are

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,040
So super sprung, Jesus plans by far

93
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,260
You're super sprung, that is what you are

94
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,760
So keep this ring and chain, just dance that song

95
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,760
I know, I know, I know, I know

96
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Hey, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
It is the end, guys.

98
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,760
30 minutes before we officially pull the plug on Orange Lounge Radio

99
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,760
and five and a half years of memories on Live 365.

100
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
But no tears, no crying, dammit.

101
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
There's no crying in internet radio

102
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,260
because the future begins at AllGames.com this Sunday.

103
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,260
The new chapter of Orange Lounge Radio.

104
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,260
But we take a look back at some of the important things

105
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,760
that have happened over the past five years.

106
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,260
And you gotta love this guy.

107
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,760
He was one of the first very accessible people on it.

108
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,260
Oh, actually, we're gonna take a quick little detour here.

109
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,760
Somebody's calling me a little early here.

110
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
We're gonna go Skype line.

111
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Hello, are you there?

112
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm here.

113
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Hello, how are you, Jamie?

114
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Tired.

115
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
Been all day at IKEA.

116
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
How was IKEA?

117
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
What were you going shopping for at IKEA?

118
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,260
It was Swedish.

119
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,760
It was very Swedish.

120
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Were you going for meatballs or what?

121
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,260
We actually had meatballs.

122
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,760
And then I saw the herring and decided that it was disgusting.

123
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
And I bought shelves.

124
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
What are you gonna be organizing later?

125
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,760
The computer room.

126
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Fun.

127
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
It's a wreck.

128
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Sounds like fun.

129
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
It's a freaking wreck.

130
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
A freaking wreck.

131
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
Well, hey, we're at the end, Jamie.

132
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,760
This is 30 minutes before we pull the plug on the station.

133
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,260
And it's all over.

134
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,760
Are you sad?

135
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
No.

136
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
No?

137
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Me neither, really.

138
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
We have a few people joining us.

139
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
The chat is filled up a little bit.

140
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Chat.orangelaundry.com.

141
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
We have a handful of people here.

142
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
This is really the loyalist we have here tonight.

143
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,760
The people that have been with us through thick and thin, through five and a half years.

144
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Do you have anything you want to say to those people as we say goodbye tonight?

145
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
To our listeners?

146
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Yeah.

147
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
I like fire.

148
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Always have and always will.

149
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Yeah, I can hang out on the phone for a little while.

150
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
All right.

151
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,760
We're going to ignite our flame pit and charge some melon flesh.

152
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Awesome.

153
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Sounds awesome.

154
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Well, hey, since you're on the phone, I'm gonna play a song just for you, okay?

155
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Okay.

156
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
All right.

157
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
This is a game.

158
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,760
I'm doing things a little bit out of order here, but that's okay, Jamie.

159
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
I was gonna play something else.

160
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
We'll do this song.

161
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,760
This is a song from a game, and this is a little bit newer, but this is a game that

162
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Jamie has just... She hasn't really shut up about in the past year because she just

163
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
loves this game so much.

164
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,760
It's Portal, and you gotta love this song.

165
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Bobby wants me to remind you of this, though.

166
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,760
You know Jonathan Colton, the man who sings this song we're about to play, Still Alive?

167
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,760
You know he also sang a song called Skullcrusher Mountain, which was once in our cage match

168
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
like three years ago.

169
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
No, not that long ago.

170
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Probably about two years ago.

171
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Yeah, and everybody in chat hated it.

172
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,760
We all hated it, but now he's super famous with this Still Alive.

173
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
It's kind of ironic, don't you think?

174
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
His other stuff is pretty quirky, too.

175
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
It is pretty awesome.

176
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
All right, so here it is.

177
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,760
We're gonna play Still Alive for our listeners, and we'll come back and dish a little more

178
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
before we say goodbye tonight.

179
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,760
This was a triumph.

180
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,760
I'm making a note here, huge success.

181
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:47,760
It's hard to upstate my satisfaction.

182
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Aperture Science.

183
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,760
We do what we must, because we can.

184
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,760
For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead.

185
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,760
But there's no sense crying over every mistake.

186
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,760
You just keep on trying till you run above cake.

187
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:22,760
And the science gets done, and you make a neat come for the people who are still alive.

188
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,760
I'm not even angry.

189
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,760
I'm being so sincere right now.

190
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Even though you broke my heart and killed me.

191
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,760
I'm twirling to pieces.

192
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,760
And through every piece came to a fire.

193
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,760
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you.

194
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Now these points of data make a beautiful line.

195
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,760
And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time.

196
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:15,760
So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive.

197
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Go ahead and leave me.

198
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,760
I think I'd prefer to stay inside.

199
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.

200
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Maybe Black Mesa.

201
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,760
That was a joke, haha, at chance.

202
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Anyway, this cake is great.

203
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
It's so delicious and moist.

204
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Look at me still talking when there's science to do.

205
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,760
When I look up there it makes me glad I'm not you, I've experimented too long.

206
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,760
There is research to be done on the people who are still alive.

207
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Then leave me, I'm still alive.

208
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm doing science and I'm still alive.

209
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,760
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.

210
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
While you're dying I'll be still alive.

211
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,760
And when you're dead I will be still alive.

212
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Still alive, still alive.

213
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,760
That's Jonathan Goldin here with Still Alive on OLR, the final little live show.

214
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,760
When we're going to be pulling the plug on OLR in 23 minutes.

215
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Jamie's joining us by phone, you still there Jamie?

216
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Uh, no.

217
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
You're half dead.

218
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Hey, you want to hear the latest in the Live 365 drama?

219
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
This is hilarious.

220
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Do tell.

221
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,760
I tried to send them a, oh my god, it's so hard to cancel your account with them, right?

222
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,760
So you have to send them an email in order to cancel the account because they have no handy dandy thing on the web.

223
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,760
So I sent them an email like on Monday, hasn't been responded to.

224
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Sent them an email like second request Thursday or Friday, still hasn't been responded to.

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,760
So I'm just like great, they're going to try to charge my card tomorrow.

226
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
But aha, I'm one step ahead of them.

227
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm going to call the bank tomorrow and put a stop pay on anything they try to do.

228
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
So things are going to get ugly.

229
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Ha.

230
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Well, you've already paid for the service and they're going to try to do those to just cut it off anyway, right?

231
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Exactly, that's the thing.

232
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,760
I don't have 85 bucks or whatever much they're going to try to charge us for another month.

233
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
I don't want to be here another month.

234
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
We're ready for the future, dang it.

235
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
That's some crap.

236
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,760
I know, it's such crap.

237
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
The crap is the best part for it.

238
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,760
How did you put up with this for five years?

239
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Because we were lazy.

240
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

241
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
We're super lazy.

242
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Nothing is as motivating as being forced into it.

243
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
True, very true.

244
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,760
I think it's kind of part of the thing we're learning here throughout this transition.

245
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,760
But the future of OLR is going to be very exciting.

246
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,760
You know I got to play with the All Great Game stream yesterday.

247
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
I got to hijack it for a little bit.

248
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
It was lots of fun.

249
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
The quality is really good.

250
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,760
I think it's going to be a good time.

251
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Well, I've got news.

252
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
What's that?

253
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,760
They brought up a blog for that Street Fighter movie.

254
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Well, the blog was overloaded because of a lot of heavy web traffic.

255
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
But they've got it back up now.

256
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,760
It's at streetfightermovie.net.

257
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Interesting.

258
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li, which means I'm not going to watch it because she's my least favorite character.

259
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
I'll watch it if Kylie's in it.

260
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Even if she has a cameo or is on the soundtrack, I'll still watch it.

261
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Yeah.

262
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
It'll be awesome.

263
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
I'm sure we'll talk more about that on Tomorrow Night Show.

264
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Also on Tomorrow Night Show, I just taped it not even 20 minutes ago.

265
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,760
It's the reason why we started a little bit after 7 tonight.

266
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Farbs, the man who wrote Romcheck Fail is going to be on Tomorrow Night Show.

267
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
It's going to be good times.

268
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Good times.

269
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,760
And I played a whole lot of Romcheck Fail today because I had to do research for the interview.

270
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
So it'll be good times.

271
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Alright, hey, we've got to squeeze in a bunch more songs.

272
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Everybody is wondering what the last song is that's ever going to be played on O.L.R.

273
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,760
And Jamie, I hate to tell you, I've already picked it out and there's nothing you can do about it.

274
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
I've already picked out the-

275
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
I thought that-

276
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
What?

277
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,760
I thought we were going to do the one that we discussed because I found it.

278
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Oh, no, no, that'll be the next to last song.

279
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,760
But then it occurred to me that there really is only one song we can go out with.

280
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
There's really only one song.

281
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
But that'll be the next to last song.

282
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Okay.

283
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Alright.

284
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
See, even I'm keeping Jamie in suspense here.

285
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
But you will approve.

286
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
Trust me, you'll approve.

287
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
I will?

288
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Yes, you will.

289
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Will you tell me out there?

290
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
You better or I'm going to stick you with a spork.

291
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Yeah, if you join chat or something, I'll tell you.

292
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Okay.

293
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Alright.

294
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Hey-

295
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
I actually don't have IRC on this computer yet.

296
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Dang you.

297
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Go to chat.

298
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
I'm going to download it.

299
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Go to chat.orangehondrena.com, silly pants.

300
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
I hate that client.

301
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Alright.

302
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Hey, we're going to play another song here.

303
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
We're going to play some remixes here in this break.

304
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,760
And one person we came to know and love during the OLR run on Live at 365 was Midi Head,

305
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,760
like the first accessible DDR artist to all of us.

306
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,760
He actually came on the show and did an interview and he was a lot of fun.

307
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
So we're going to play one of his remixes right now.

308
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,760
It's Midi Head's smack mix of Jelly Kiss.

309
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,760
We'll be back with more at the end.

310
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:53,760
See you on OLR.

311
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Bye.

312
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Bye.

313
00:17:52,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Jerry Kiss here on Orange Lounge Radio.

314
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Hey, you know, one of the first big whoopty-doo deal shows we ever had on Orange Lounge Radio.

315
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,640
Do you remember when we got to premiere a brand new DDR song before anybody else did

316
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Dark Sakura?

317
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Yeah.

318
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,640
And I'm thinking not even like we did it for some of the Xbox games a couple of years ago,

319
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,640
but even way, way, way before that because we had buddies at Konami.

320
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,640
We got to premiere the DDR version of Your Rain.

321
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
You remember that?

322
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Yeah, I do.

323
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
It was huge.

324
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
We actually got some longtime listeners out of that one night.

325
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
It was a huge night for us.

326
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,640
So I thought maybe we could tip our hat and play that song.

327
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,640
Even though you hate this remix, Jamie, it's an important part of OLR history.

328
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
So I think we got to play it.

329
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Here it is.

330
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Here it is.

331
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Here it is.

332
00:19:40,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Here it is.

333
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:22,640
I will never forget how we teased everybody with like little bits and pieces and clips

334
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
of that song for like three hours.

335
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,640
And people actually stayed to hear the whole damn thing because they're awesome.

336
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
I know.

337
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
That was really cool.

338
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
That was an awesome night.

339
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,640
You know, we got to figure out a way to get the old shows to the fans because we have

340
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
people.

341
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
I mean, I got to say, I get emails from Misty all the time.

342
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
You got to let out the old shows.

343
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
I don't even know if we have all the old shows.

344
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
Some of them are like long gone.

345
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,640
I know there's at least one episode that got botched archive or something that's never

346
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
coming back, but a pretty good chunk of them.

347
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,640
We're going to have to get some DVDs out there in the next year or something now that we

348
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,640
have time since we're not managing a station 24-7 anymore.

349
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,640
Well, hey, guess who's in chat?

350
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
Hey, you're in chat.

351
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Hey, then you can see everybody there, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

352
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Hey, while you say hello to people in chat, I thought since Loki's not on the phone tonight,

353
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
we need to tip our hat at the one and only Loki somehow.

354
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Little known fact about Loki, he actually was not a full-time show host when the show

355
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
started.

356
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
He did not join full-time until episode 20.

357
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,640
And Jamie and I made the decision to anoint him as a host of the program because, well,

358
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
he just never went away.

359
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,640
I mean, he came to every single program, but he was very passionate and obviously has done

360
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,640
a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of great work for OLR over the years and is just as

361
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
much a part of the station as the rest of us.

362
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,640
So I got to play a Loki remix because he's a very talented remixer.

363
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,640
This is probably one of the most famous remixes he did over the years.

364
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
So you ready for this?

365
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,640
This is Don't Play Nice, the Zodiac Mix by Loki and Verbilicious.

366
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,640
Oh, then don't answer your iPhone when you hear this, Jamie.

367
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

368
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

369
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

370
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

371
00:23:47,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

372
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:31,640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

373
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Loki versus Verbilicious with Don't Play Nice, the Zodiac Mix.

374
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Eleven minutes until the plug gets pulled.

375
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
We don't have a lot of time, but hey, you know,

376
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Orange Launch Radio started as a, you know, DDR, 2DX, BeatMania, Parappa,

377
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
you know, all those music games.

378
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
You started as a station like that.

379
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
We all came together, DarkSakura, myself, and Loki.

380
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,640
We all met playing DDR at the local arcade.

381
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,640
I mean, literally, that is how Orange Launch Radio started.

382
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Do you remember the first time we met DarkSakura?

383
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,640
I do, actually. Wasn't it over in Milpitas?

384
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,640
It was. It was the day we all went to go play Para Para Paradise together.

385
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,640
Yeah, and so Siege was there and doing his thing.

386
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,640
That's right. Raven to the beat.

387
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:37,640
Jamie, what would you say is your favorite DDR song of all freaking time?

388
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,640
I'd have to actually say the Brilliant to You OG.

389
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Brilliant to You OG. Shit, I had something else queued up.

390
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,640
That's all right. I can find it. I know I have it.

391
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Honestly, that's been my favorite DDR song since, like, the very beginning.

392
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,640
What is it about Brilliant to You OG that makes it your very fav?

393
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Because I'm going to do a block here of the host's favorite DDR song,

394
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
because I know Loki's, and I'll play mine too.

395
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Tell me what you did have for me.

396
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
I had Love by Sonic Dream.

397
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,640
Actually, no. I love, I adore that song, but it wasn't my favorite DDR song.

398
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,640
That's all good. I think I have OG remixed queued up somewhere here.

399
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,640
I just got to dig for it a little bit. Not a problem.

400
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,640
I just thought that it was different, you know?

401
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,640
I thought that I liked the mix itself, and the steps were a lot of fun.

402
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,640
That's true. It was a lot of fun.

403
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
Definitely one of the first Carter songs I've done.

404
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,640
Oh my gosh, I do not have B4U Orchestral Groove. How is that?

405
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,640
I have, like, the entire DDR Freak Radio playlist from back in the day,

406
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,640
and somehow I don't have B4U Orchestral Groove.

407
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Well, let me see.

408
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
How is that?

409
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,640
I have it.

410
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,640
I might have it. You know, I have the third mix.

411
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
Wasn't it on third mix?

412
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,640
I have it.

413
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,640
I'm looking in my portable drive now.

414
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,640
Okay, then we'll do mine and Loki's first while we dig for that,

415
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
so we don't have a lot of time.

416
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
I wouldn't expect you playing Love.

417
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Alright, then we might play Love, just in the interest of time,

418
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,640
and everyone will just know for the record that Rob screwed up.

419
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Hey, what better way to end OLR than me screwing up?

420
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Here it is, Love by Sonic Dream.

421
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:23,640
One of Jamie's favorite DDR songs. One of them.

422
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:58,640
You're like a dream come true, I feel so beautiful.

423
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,640
And heart and style is all those of you.

424
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Love, I've just got to have it.

425
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
I believe in love.

426
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,140
I can't be without it

427
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,640
Come to me and make your confession

428
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Love, come let it go

429
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,140
Love, like it's got a habit I believe in

430
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,140
Love, I can't be without it

431
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,640
Come to me and make your confession

432
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Love, come let it go

433
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Here comes my favorite DDR song of all time and it's from a home version

434
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,640
Love, like it's got a habit

435
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Theo

Understand me now

446
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,640
Listen to the words I'm saying baby

447
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,140
I found my soul

448
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,140
Let it keep me hanging on

449
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,640
Understand me now

450
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,140
The frequency of the beat gets higher

451
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,140
And I'm pretty sure this song is Matt's favorite DVR song

452
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:37,140
Let's move it on

453
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,640
Let's go

454
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,640
Go

455
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Let's go

456
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,140
People now moving on

457
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,140
My dreams will come true

458
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,140
I'll be with you

459
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,140
I just can't stop thinking of you

460
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,140
You'll say goodbye

461
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,140
I'll make you fly

462
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:17,140
Into the deep blue sky tonight

463
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,140
I'll do everything to please come back

464
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,140
Into my life

465
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,140
Come on baby I'm waiting for you

466
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,140

467
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,640

00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,140
Moving on

473
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:55,140
Moving on

474
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Let's go

475
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,140
Alright it's almost that time

476
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,140
We're like four minutes from the end or about five minutes

477
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
I might go a little bit over but

478
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,140
Jamie it's just about over

479
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,140
I don't know what else to say

480
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
What Jamie?

481
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
I just said yeah

482
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,140
Oh okay I thought you said Rob

483
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,140
I thought you were going to do the Rob Rob Rob thing

484
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,140
Rob

485
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,140
What?

486
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,140
No

487
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Alright

488
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Well we

489
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,140
What?

490
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,140
No

491
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,140
Alright

492
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,140
We promise

493
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,140
I hate you

494
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
I hate you so much

495
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,140
What?

496
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,140
Hi

497
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,140
Hi

498
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,140
You know what Jamie?

499
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,140
It's time for you to get the F out

500
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,140
Of Live 365

501
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,140
No we swore that this was going to be our last song

502
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,140
And it's not

503
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
It's actually our next to last song in Live 365

504
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,140
But it's very fitting for the end of Orange Lounge Radio

505
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,140
It's 2 Live Crew with one of their classics

506
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,140
So anything else you want to say about this song Jamie?

507
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,140
I have memories of this song from my freshman year of high school

508
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,140
I'll play it that way

509
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,140
Awesome

510
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,140
And we dedicate this to all the OLR listeners

511
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,140
Who have stuck with us for five years

512
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,140
Through thick and thin right?

513
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,140
We dedicate it to all of you

514
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,140
And hope you'll be able to recover from the message in this song

515
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,140
Here it is, 2 Live Crew

516
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,140
It's my house, and if you don't like it, get the fuck out

517
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,140
So get the fuck out

518
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,140
You sorry ass bitch

519
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,140
You come in my house

520
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,140
Eating all my shit

521
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,140
So get the fuck out

Get the fuck, get the fuck, get the fuck outna my bitch

00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,640

Look at you, you sorry ass, but I'm raggedy bitch

00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:47,640
House, house, house, house, house, house, house, house, house, house

532
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:55,140
Get the fuck out, get the fuck out, get the fuck out my house

533
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:59,140
You're callin' all your friends on my telephone

534
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,140
You need to leave all them bull-daggin' bitches alone

535
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,140
I got bitches that do shit for me that you can never do bitch

536
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,140
They suck me, fuck me, and give me money too

537
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Get the fuck out, get the fuck out, get the fuck out my house, bitch

538
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Get the fuck out, get the fuck out my house, bitch

539
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:35,640
House, house, house, house, house, house, house, house

540
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,640
House, house, house, house, house, house

541
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:49,640
So get your ass out of my motherfuckin' house Let the doe dog hit you, well the dog should have bit you

542
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:57,640
You lazy ass bitch, I don't need to take this shit So get the fuck out of my motherfuckin' house

543
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Bitch, get the fuck out Bitch, get the fuck out my house

544
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:13,640
It's my house, and if you don't like it, get the fuck out I don't give a fuck

545
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:53,640
Bitch, get the fuck out Bitch, get the fuck out Bitch, get the fuck out my house

546
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:07,640
Catch, catch, catch, catch, catch, catch, catch, catch

547
00:37:37,640 --> 00:38:04,000
Well guys, here it is.

548
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
The end.

549
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
This is it.

550
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's eight o'clock.

551
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,760
It's time to pull the plug.

552
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,840
It's time to say goodbye to the station we started five and a half years ago.

553
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
It's time to say hello to the future.

554
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Can we set it on fire?

555
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Huh?

556
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
We're still here.

557
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
What?

558
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Can we set it on fire?

559
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Can we set the station on fire?

560
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
God damn I wish.

561
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,120
But no, what we're going to be doing, the reason why we're pulling the plug at eight

562
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
is that we want to be cleared out.

563
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,680
We want to be moved out by 9 Eastern and that means we're going to be purging everything

564
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,000
from the archives because we don't want Live 365 to continue to operate our station as

565
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,680
a VIP only thing.

566
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,160
Everything is going to be completely wiped and officially we've merged with AllGames.com

567
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,480
but you know I must say I'm going to miss being the overlord of my own radio station

568
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
with my friends.

569
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,540
You know, getting to take over the stream randomly.

570
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,400
No more random bursts of Abba.

571
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,920
It's kind of going to be sad but what can you do?

572
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
That's what Justin TV swore right?

573
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Yep.

574
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,920
And then of course you know, you never know, we might be able to twist Bobby's arm enough

575
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,440
and maybe we get something special over at AllGames like a very fucked up Christmas from

576
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,800
Jamie and Rob or something like that.

577
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
You never know.

578
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
So.

579
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
So.

580
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
That would be fun.

581
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,500
I'm sorry, the chat was correct to me, it's supposed to be 9 Pacific which would be Midnight

582
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Eastern.

583
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,720
I want to be moved out by Midnight Eastern which is only about an hour away and I have

584
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
dinner planned.

585
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,780
So this is it.

586
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,780
The last song.

587
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,600
I'm going to introduce it here in just a moment but Jamie, do you have any last things you

588
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,200
want to say?

589
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,440
Um, a couple things.

590
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Sure.

591
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:38,680
Number one, Live 365, thank you for giving in to the whole RIAA scare tactic bullshit

592
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
going on.

593
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,000
That's the number one thing.

594
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:52,960
Number two, I really like hamburgers and number three, cinnamon buns from Ikea are really

595
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,400
really really tasty and smell really really really good but they're really really bad

596
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
for you.

597
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,840
And the very final thing is reject false icons.

598
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
Of course.

599
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
I have to name a new one.

600
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,320
This has been my catchphrase for life.

601
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,320
Okay.

602
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,280
Nothing changes until you make a change.

603
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,480
That is true.

604
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Very true.

605
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,760
And now we're making a change.

606
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,320
We're going to change tomorrow is when it all starts.

607
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
This is kind of sad.

608
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
It's a sad moment.

609
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,640
It's happy and it's sad, you know what I mean?

610
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,080
Like I feel bad for all the folks that have really supported us over five and a half years

611
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,520
of internet radio.

612
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,740
I know the show, the music and all that stuff is going away, but you know, obviously the

613
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,960
show is still going to be there.

614
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
We're still going to be there.

615
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,240
The community is still going to be there.

616
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,280
The oil army is still going to be there.

617
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,680
Nothing is really going away except our stream.

618
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,920
And as we merge into Voltron, what's that?

619
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,280
We're starting over.

620
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,080
We are starting over indeed, truer words.

621
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,400
So that's it.

622
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,200
I just want to say thank you to everybody in chat right now.

623
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,600
Everybody who couldn't be here tonight, but wanted to be everybody that supported us for

624
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
five and a half years.

625
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,360
And please continue to support us in the future.

626
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,400
That's going to bring us to the last song and Jamie, do you want me to hang up or just

627
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,040
keep you on through this?

628
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
I'll stay on.

629
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Okay.

630
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
This is what's going to happen folks.

631
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,840
I'm going to play the last song, which you know, after thinking long and hard, we wanted

632
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,680
to pick one song that really just encompassed everything that Orange Lounge Radio in the

633
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,680
past five and a half years.

634
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,080
If you could just sum it up into one song, this is it.

635
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,680
So we're going to play this and then that's it.

636
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,720
You're going to hear silence and then you're going to hear the stream get cut and that's

637
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,840
the end.

638
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,600
So that's it.

639
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,120
Any last, last, last things, Jamie, because this is really it.

640
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,640
We're not saying anything after the song.

641
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
It's over.

642
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,600
The plug's getting pulled.

643
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:51,360
I guess I hope you all have been listening to.

644
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
Absolutely.

645
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:58,280
You know that Herring Row I was talking about earlier?

646
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
The brand is ABBA.

647
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
Awesome.

648
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
All right.

649
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,520
So you have candidates, that's us.

650
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,600
You will keep going on with randomness as long as I let you.

651
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Yes I will.

652
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Okay.

653
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Play the damn song.

654
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
All right.

655
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,080
Group hug and chat everybody.

656
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,080
Here it is.

657
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,140
The last song and then the plug getting pulled.

658
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,520
Thank you for myself, Dark Sakura, Loki, everybody.

659
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,020
Thank you for your support of Orange Lounge Radio.

660
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,240
We are starting over.

661
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,480
We'll see you tomorrow night at AllGames.com.

662
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:52,000
Good night everybody.

663
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:25,480
Good night.

664
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:53,960
Good night.

665
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:21,960
Good night.

666
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:43,440
Good night.

667
00:44:51,960 --> 00:45:17,440
Good night.

668
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:42,920
Good night.
