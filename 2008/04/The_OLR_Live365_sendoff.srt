[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio will be closing after April 12th.

2
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:25,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all who have supported us in our five and a half years of broadcasting.

3
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:30,060
[SPEAKER_01]: On April 13th, please join us in our future projects at our new home.

[SPEAKER_00]: Live365.com

5
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,235
Like a shooting star

6
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:34,807
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the end, guys.

8
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:41,591
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 minutes before we officially pull the plug on Orange Lounge Radio and five and a half years of memories on Live 365.

9
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:43,592
[SPEAKER_01]: But no tears, no crying, damn it.

10
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,493
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no crying in internet radio.

11
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:49,174
[SPEAKER_01]: because the future begins at allgames.com this Sunday.

12
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,155
[SPEAKER_01]: The new chapter of Orange Lounge Radio.

13
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:54,376
[SPEAKER_01]: But we take a look back at some of the important things that have happened over the past five years.

14
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:55,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to love this guy.

15
00:06:56,316 --> 00:07:01,398
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one of the first very accessible people on... Oh, actually, we're going to take a quick little detour here.

16
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:02,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's calling me a little early here.

17
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:03,538
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go sky blind.

18
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, are you there?

19
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:07,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.

20
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, how are you, Jamie?

21
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Tired.

22
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:12,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Been all day at Ikea.

23
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:14,921
[SPEAKER_01]: How was Ikea?

24
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:16,602
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you going shopping for at Ikea?

25
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:17,903
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Swedish.

26
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,644
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very Swedish?

27
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:21,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you going for meatballs or what?

28
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:25,929
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually had meatballs and then I saw the herring and decided that it was disgusting.

29
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,372
[SPEAKER_07]: And I bought shelves.

30
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,533
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to be organizing later?

31
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:35,175
[SPEAKER_07]: The computer room.

32
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:36,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun.

33
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:37,436
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a wreck.

34
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:40,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like fun.

35
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:41,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a freaking wreck.

36
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:50,032
[SPEAKER_01]: a freaking wreck well hey we're at the end Jamie this is 30 minutes before we pull the plug on the station and it's all over are you sad?

37
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:51,514
[SPEAKER_07]: no

38
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:56,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Me neither, really.

39
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:58,383
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few people joining us.

40
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:02,025
[SPEAKER_01]: The chat is filled up a little bit, chat.orangelandrady.com.

41
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:03,345
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a handful of people here.

42
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:08,628
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really the loyalists we have here tonight, the people that have been with us through thick and thin, through five and a half years.

43
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:13,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything you want to say to those people as we say goodbye tonight?

44
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,450
[SPEAKER_07]: To our listeners?

45
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

46
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:18,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I like fire.

47
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:21,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Always have and always will.

48
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:25,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can hang out on the phone for a little while.

49
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:30,008
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, sounds... We're going to ignite our flame pit and char some malum flush.

50
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

51
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:31,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds awesome.

52
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:36,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hey, since you're on the phone, I'm going to play a song just for you, okay?

53
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:37,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

54
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:37,727
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

55
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,468
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a game.

56
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:42,350
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing things a little bit out of order here, but that's okay, Jamie.

57
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to play something else.

58
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:44,852
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do this song.

59
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:56,679
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a song from a game, and this is a little bit newer, but this is a game that Jamie is just â€“ she hasn't really shut up about in the past year because she just loves this game so much, and it's Portal.

60
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:57,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Portal.

61
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,790
[SPEAKER_01]: His other stuff is pretty quirky too.

62
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:28,111
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a triumph I'm making a note here, huge success It's hard to overstate my satisfaction Aperture science

63
00:09:51,738 --> 00:10:12,349
[SPEAKER_04]: We do what we must because we can For the good of all of us Except the ones who are dead But there's no sense crying over every mistake You just keep on trying till you run out of cake And the science gets done

64
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:57,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being so sincere right now Even though you broke my heart and killed me And tore me to pieces And blew every piece into a pile As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you Now these points of data make a beautiful

65
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:05,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'd prefer to stay inside Maybe you'll find someone else to help

66
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:36,963
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the joke?

67
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Haha, bad chance.

68
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:45,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist.

69
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:50,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at me, still talking when there's science to do.

70
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:53,803
[SPEAKER_03]: When I look up there it makes me glad I'm not you.

71
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:56,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I've experimented too long, there is

72
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:33,879
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Jonathan Coulton here with Still Alive on OLR, the final little live show when we're going to be pulling the plug on OLR in 23 minutes.

73
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie's joining us by phone.

74
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,061
[SPEAKER_01]: You still there, Jamie?

75
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:38,124
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

76
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:39,506
[SPEAKER_01]: You're half dead.

77
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you want to hear the latest in the Live 365 drama?

78
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:43,390
[SPEAKER_01]: This is hilarious.

79
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to send them an account.

80
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:49,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, it's so hard to cancel your account with them, right?

81
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:54,190
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to send them an email in order to cancel the account because they have no handy dandy thing on the web.

82
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,953
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sent them an email like on Monday, hasn't been responded to.

83
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:02,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Sent them an email like second request Thursday or Friday, still hasn't been responded to.

84
00:13:02,757 --> 00:13:04,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just like, great.

85
00:13:04,338 --> 00:13:07,981
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to try to charge my card tomorrow, but aha, I'm one step ahead of them.

86
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:11,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call the bank tomorrow and put a stop pay on anything they try to do.

87
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:12,925
[SPEAKER_01]: So things are going to get ugly.

88
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you've already paid for the service, and if you're going to try to do those, you should just cut it off anyway, right?

89
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:20,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, that's the thing.

90
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:24,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have 85 bucks or whatever much they're going to try to charge us for another month.

91
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be here another month.

92
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:28,467
[SPEAKER_01]: We're ready for the future, dang it.

93
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:30,048
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so crap.

94
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, it's such crap.

95
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,571
[SPEAKER_07]: The crap is the best word for it.

96
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:37,673
[SPEAKER_01]: How did we put up with this for five years?

97
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:40,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we were lazy.

98
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, something like that.

99
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:42,816
[SPEAKER_01]: We're super lazy.

100
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:43,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing is...

101
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing is as motivating as being forced into it.

102
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:47,818
[SPEAKER_01]: True, very true.

103
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:51,559
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of part of the thing we're learning here throughout this transition.

104
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:54,280
[SPEAKER_01]: But the future of OLR is going to be very exciting.

105
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,341
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got to play with the all-grit game stream yesterday.

106
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to hijack it for a little bit.

107
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:00,062
[SPEAKER_01]: It was lots of fun.

108
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:01,162
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality is really good.

109
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:02,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a good time.

110
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:06,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I've got news.

111
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:06,984
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

112
00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:12,466
[SPEAKER_07]: They've brought up a blog for that Street Fighter movie.

113
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:12,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

114
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the blog was, I guess, overloaded because of a lot of heavy web traffic.

115
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,344
[SPEAKER_07]: But they've got it back up now.

116
00:14:23,484 --> 00:14:25,565
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at streetfightermovie.net.

117
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:27,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

118
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:32,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter, The Legend of Chun-Li, which means I'm not going to watch it because she's my least favorite character.

119
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:35,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll watch it if Kylie's in it.

120
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

121
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:40,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if she has a cameo or is on the soundtrack, I'll still watch it.

122
00:14:41,317 --> 00:14:41,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

123
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:42,398
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be awesome.

124
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:44,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we'll talk more about that on tomorrow night's show.

125
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on tomorrow night's show, I just taped it not even 20 minutes ago.

126
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:51,082
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the reason why we started a little bit after 7 tonight.

127
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:55,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Farbs, the man who wrote Rom Check Fail is going to be on tomorrow night's show.

128
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:00,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we were going to do the one that we discussed because I found it

129
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, that'll be the next to last song.

130
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:28,037
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it occurred to me that there really is only one song we can go out with.

131
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:29,717
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really only one song.

132
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,658
[SPEAKER_01]: But that'll be the next to last song.

133
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:33,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

134
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:33,699
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

135
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:37,060
[SPEAKER_01]: See, even I'm keeping Jamie in suspense here, but you will approve.

136
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, you'll approve.

137
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I will?

138
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:39,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you will.

139
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:40,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you tell me off air?

140
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:41,742
[SPEAKER_01]: You better.

141
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:43,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stick you with a spork.

142
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:45,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you join chat or something, I'll tell you.

143
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:46,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

144
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:47,143
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

145
00:15:47,844 --> 00:15:50,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually don't have IRC on this computer yet.

146
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:51,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang you.

147
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:55,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to download it I hate that client I'm downloading it

148
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:16,077
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually came on the show and did an interview and he was a lot of fun.

149
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:18,480
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to play one of his remixes right now.

150
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,306
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Middyhead's smack mix of Jelly Kiss.

151
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:25,150
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be back with more at the end.

152
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,351
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know a lot.

153
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:10,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry Kiss here on Orange Lounge Radio.

154
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:21,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know, one of the first big whoop-dee-doo deal shows we ever had on Orange Lounge Radio, do you remember when we got to premiere a brand new DDR song before anybody else did, DarkSakura?

155
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:22,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.

156
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:35,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was, and I'm thinking not even like, we did it for some of the Xbox games a couple years ago, but even way, way, way before that, because we had buddies at Konami, we got to premiere the DDR version of Your Rain, you remember that?

157
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:35,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

158
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:36,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do.

159
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:36,895
[SPEAKER_01]: That it is.

160
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:28,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I will never forget how we teased everybody with like little bits and pieces and clips of that song for like three hours and people actually stayed to hear the whole damn thing because they're awesome.

161
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:30,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, that was really cool

162
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:01,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you're in chat.

163
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:05,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, then you can see everybody there, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

164
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:13,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, while you say hello to people in chat, I thought since Loki's not on the phone tonight, we need to tip our hat at the one and only Loki somehow.

165
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:18,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Little known fact about Loki, he actually was not a full-time show host when the show started.

166
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:25,275
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not join full-time until episode 20, and Jamie and I made the decision to anoint him as a host of the program because...

167
00:21:25,695 --> 00:21:26,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he just never went away.

168
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:37,239
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he came to every single program, but he was very passionate and obviously has done a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of great work for OLR over the years and is just as much a part of the station as the rest of us.

169
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to play a Loki remix because he's a very talented remixer.

170
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:44,142
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably one of the most famous remixes he did over the years.

171
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:44,862
[SPEAKER_01]: So you ready for this?

172
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:51,205
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Don't Play Nice, the Zodiac Mix by Loki and Verbilicious.

173
00:21:51,505 --> 00:21:53,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, then don't answer your iPhone when you hear this, Jamie.

174
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:07,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Checking if the DJ's hot, I'm just chillin'

175
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's switch it up.

176
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:48,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki versus Verbalicious with Don't Play Nice, the Zodiac mix.

177
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,917
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 minutes till the plug gets pulled.

178
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:59,581
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a lot of time, but hey, you know, Orange Lounge Radio started as a, you know, DDR, 2DX, Beatmania, Parappa, you know, all those music games.

179
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:00,861
[SPEAKER_01]: We started as a station like that.

180
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:03,822
[SPEAKER_01]: We all came together, DarkSakura, myself, and Loki.

181
00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:06,423
[SPEAKER_01]: We all met playing DDR at the local arcade.

182
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally, that is how Orange Lounge Radio started.

183
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:11,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember the first time we met, DarkSakura?

184
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:13,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, actually.

185
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:18,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't it over in Milpitas?

186
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:18,770
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.

187
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,352
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the day we all went to go play Para Para Paradise together.

188
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and so Siege was there and doing his thing.

189
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:28,075
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, raving to the beat.

190
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:32,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Jamie, what would you say is your favorite DDR song of all freaking time?

191
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:39,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to actually say the brilliant T.O.G.,

192
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant2U OG.

193
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:43,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, I had something else queued up.

194
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,280
[SPEAKER_01]: That's alright.

195
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I can find it.

196
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I have it.

197
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:55,742
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it about Brilliant2U OG that makes it your very fave?

198
00:25:56,082 --> 00:26:00,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm going to do a block here of the host's favorite DDR song because I know Loki's and I'll play mine too.

199
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I had Love by Sonic Dream.

200
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no.

201
00:26:07,743 --> 00:26:10,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I love, I adore that song, but it wasn't my favorite DDR song.

202
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:11,725
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all good.

203
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:13,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have OG Remix queued up somewhere here.

204
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:15,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I just gotta dig for it a little bit.

205
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:16,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a problem.

206
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:19,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought that it was different, you know.

207
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:23,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that I liked the mix itself, and the steps were a lot of fun.

208
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:24,692
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

209
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:25,132
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun.

210
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,513
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the first harder songs I've done.

211
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:30,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, I do not have B4U Orchestra Groove.

212
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:31,050
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that?

213
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:36,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, like, the entire DDR Freak Radio playlist from back in the day, and somehow I don't have B4U Orchestra Groove.

214
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me see.

215
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:39,474
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that?

216
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:41,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it.

217
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:42,876
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have it.

218
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:43,977
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have the third mix.

219
00:26:45,998 --> 00:26:46,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't it on third mix?

220
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:49,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Good money, DDR...

221
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:52,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking in my portable drive now.

222
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:58,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, then we'll do mine and Loki's first while we dig for that so we don't have a lot of time.

223
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't object to you playing Love.

224
00:27:01,046 --> 00:27:07,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, then we might play Love just in the interest of time and everyone will just know for the record that Rob screwed up.

225
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:10,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what better way to end OLR than me screwing up?

226
00:27:12,595 --> 00:27:14,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is, Love by Sonic Dream.

227
00:27:14,956 --> 00:27:16,637
[SPEAKER_01]: One of Jamie's favorite DDR songs.

228
00:27:16,858 --> 00:27:17,158
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them.

229
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,282
I believe in

230
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes my favorite DDR song of all time and it's from a home version.

231
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:30,017
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm pretty sure this song is Matt's favorite DDR song.

232
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, it's almost that time.

233
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:08,719
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like four minutes from the end, or about five minutes.

234
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:12,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go a little bit over, but Jamie, it's just about over.

235
00:32:13,403 --> 00:32:14,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else to say.

236
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:15,545
[SPEAKER_01]: What, Jamie?

237
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:17,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I just said yeah.

238
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:18,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

239
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:18,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you said Rob.

240
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:20,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were going to do the Rob, Rob, Rob thing.

241
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:22,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

242
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:23,112
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

243
00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:24,813
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

244
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:25,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

245
00:32:26,434 --> 00:32:27,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we... What?

246
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:29,137
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

247
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:29,745
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

248
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:30,927
[SPEAKER_01]: We promise.

249
00:32:31,547 --> 00:32:32,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate you.

250
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:33,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate you so much.

251
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:36,232
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

252
00:32:36,953 --> 00:32:37,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

253
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:37,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

254
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:39,696
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, Jamie?

255
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:42,659
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for you to get the F out of Life 365.

256
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:49,058
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we swore that this was going to be our last song, and it's not.

257
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:55,045
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually our next-to-last song in Live Through CC5, but it's very fitting for the end of Orange Lounge Radio.

258
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:58,008
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 2 Live Crew with one of their classics.

259
00:32:58,589 --> 00:32:59,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here it is.

260
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you want to say about this song, Jamie?

261
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I were just...

262
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:08,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I have memories of this song from my freshman year of high school.

263
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:08,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put it that way.

264
00:33:09,115 --> 00:33:09,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

265
00:33:09,995 --> 00:33:17,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And we dedicate this to all the OLR listeners who have stuck with us for five years through thick and thin, right?

266
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,043
[SPEAKER_01]: We dedicate it to all of you and hope you'll be able to recover from the message in this song.

267
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is, 2 Life Crew.

268
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:30,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my house, and if you don't like it, get the fuck out.

269
00:33:31,128 --> 00:33:33,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my house.

270
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:34,414
Go!

271
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,245
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like it, get the fuck out!

272
00:37:57,113 --> 00:37:58,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the fuck out my house!

273
00:37:59,055 --> 00:38:00,516
[SPEAKER_02]: You missed me, bitch!

274
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:18,600
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

275
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:41,577
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be fun.

276
00:39:09,372 --> 00:39:10,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, the chat was correct to me.

277
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,874
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be 9 Pacific, which would be midnight Eastern.

278
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:17,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be moved out by midnight Eastern, which is only about an hour away, and I have dinner planned.

279
00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:19,658
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is it, the last song.

280
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:21,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to introduce it here in just a moment.

281
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:24,101
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jamie, do you have any last things you want to say?

282
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:29,063
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple things.

283
00:39:29,404 --> 00:39:29,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

284
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:34,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, Live365, fuck you for giving in to the...

285
00:39:35,578 --> 00:39:39,240
[SPEAKER_07]: whole RIAA scare tactic bullshit going on.

286
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,741
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the number one thing.

287
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:45,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, I really like hamburgers.

288
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:57,710
[SPEAKER_07]: And number three, cinnamon buns from Ikea are really, really, really tasty and smell really, really, really good, but they're really, really bad for you.

289
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,393
[SPEAKER_07]: And the very final thing is reject false icons.

290
00:40:04,147 --> 00:40:05,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I have something, a new one.

291
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,091
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been my catchphrase for life.

292
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:07,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

293
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:10,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing changes until you make it change.

294
00:40:11,197 --> 00:40:11,777
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.

295
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:12,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.

296
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:14,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're making it change.

297
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,506
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to change tomorrow is when it all starts.

298
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:20,228
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of sad.

299
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:21,489
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sad moment.

300
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:22,910
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happy and it's sad.

301
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,530
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

302
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad for all the folks that have really supported us over five and a half years of internet radio.

303
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:34,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the music and all that stuff is going away, but obviously the show is still going to be there.

304
00:40:34,878 --> 00:40:35,739
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still going to be there.

305
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:37,200
[SPEAKER_01]: The community is still going to be there.

306
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,581
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oil Army is still going to be there.

307
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is really going away except our stream.

308
00:40:42,784 --> 00:40:43,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Rob.

309
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:44,885
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

310
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:47,406
[SPEAKER_07]: We're starting over.

311
00:40:47,727 --> 00:40:48,827
[SPEAKER_01]: We are starting over.

312
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:49,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.

313
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:50,488
[SPEAKER_01]: True words.

314
00:40:51,029 --> 00:40:52,409
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.

315
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:54,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say thank you to everybody in chat right now.

316
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:56,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody who couldn't be here tonight but wanted to be.

317
00:40:57,572 --> 00:41:01,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that supported us for five and a half years and please continue to support us in the future.

318
00:41:02,195 --> 00:41:03,856
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to bring us to the last song.

319
00:41:04,697 --> 00:41:08,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jamie, do you want me to hang up or just keep you on through this?

320
00:41:09,156 --> 00:41:09,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll stay on.

321
00:41:09,776 --> 00:41:09,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

322
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:11,837
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's going to happen, folks.

323
00:41:11,897 --> 00:41:22,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play the last song, which, you know, after thinking long and hard, we wanted to pick one song that really just encompassed everything that Orange Lounge Radio in the past five and a half years.

324
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:25,624
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could just sum it up into one song, this is it.

325
00:41:26,024 --> 00:41:28,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to play this, and then that's it.

326
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:33,167
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to hear silence, and then you're going to hear the stream get cut, and that's the end.

327
00:41:33,787 --> 00:41:33,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

328
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:35,839
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

329
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Any last, last, last things, Jamie?

330
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is really it.

331
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not saying anything after the song.

332
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:40,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over.

333
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,800
[SPEAKER_01]: The plug's getting pulled.

334
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess out with the old and with the new.

335
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:50,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

336
00:41:51,782 --> 00:41:52,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So here it is.

337
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:53,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Abba-solutely?

338
00:41:54,063 --> 00:41:54,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Abba-solutely.

339
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,804
[SPEAKER_07]: You know that herring roe I was talking about earlier?

340
00:41:58,264 --> 00:41:59,144
[SPEAKER_07]: The brand is Abba.

341
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:00,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

342
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:02,005
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

343
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,265
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have tangents.

344
00:42:03,285 --> 00:42:03,805
[SPEAKER_07]: That's us.

345
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,523
[SPEAKER_01]: You will keep going on with randomness as long as I let you.

346
00:42:09,264 --> 00:42:09,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I will.

347
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:11,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, play the damn song.

348
00:42:11,945 --> 00:42:13,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Group hug and chat, everybody.

349
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:16,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is, the last song and then the plug getting pulled.

350
00:42:16,928 --> 00:42:20,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you from myself, DarkSakura, Loki, everybody.

351
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:23,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your support of Orange Lounge Radio.

352
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:25,054
[SPEAKER_01]: We are starting over.

353
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:27,795
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you tomorrow night at allgames.com.

354
00:42:28,155 --> 00:42:28,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night, everybody.

355
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:02,226
[SPEAKER_03]: and more.
