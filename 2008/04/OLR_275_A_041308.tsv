0	14000	This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.
14000	20780	Tonight April 13, 2008, Brazil bans a popular video game, could BBC show soon be coming
20780	22440	to the Nintendo Wii?
22440	27440	And we interview Fards, the creator of Rom Check Fail.
27440	31440	This is Orange Lounge Radio.
31440	35520	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35520	36520	Radio.
36520	39040	A very special week for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
39040	44000	That's right, it's the first week of us live and exclusive on AllGames.com.
44000	49340	The old chapter of our Orange Lounge Radio feed on Live 365 closed as of yesterday and
49340	53600	now we're on our new home at AllGames.com so a big hello to all of our new live listeners
53600	58720	that we've got over at AllGames.com and hello to those of you still joining us, be it through
58720	62520	the podcast feed or our old OLR faithful or what be you.
62520	65280	Remember, you can always join our chat room to interact with the show.
65280	68400	Just a quick footnote for the live folks, it is a different chat room than AllGames
68400	69400	usually uses.
69400	73520	You're going to want to head over to chat.orangeloungeradio.com or if you're already on the Game Surge
73520	76440	Network, you're going to want to use channel Orange Lounge.
76440	78260	Alright let's go ahead and introduce the cast.
78260	83100	My name is Rob Roberts but joining me as always, say hello to talk to me about the gaming news
83100	85720	and make fun of it, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
85720	86720	Hi.
86720	88640	When it deserves to be made fun of, correct?
88640	89640	Or even when it doesn't.
89640	90640	Alright, sounds good.
90640	93280	I'm an equal opportunity make fun of her.
93280	94280	Sounds good.
94280	95280	How are you doing, DarkSakura?
95280	96280	Meaty.
96280	97280	Alright.
97280	98280	I'm meaty today.
98280	99280	Did you get your pastrami today?
99280	100280	I have my pastrami.
100280	102540	I have the ferret too.
102540	104760	Very nice.
104760	108000	Too much to Bobby's dismay, you do have the ferret here in the studio with us joining
108000	109000	us.
109000	111000	Also joining us, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
111000	112000	Hello.
112000	113000	How you doing, Loki?
113000	114000	Alright.
114000	116600	And you're full of pizza, if I'm not mistaken.
116600	118440	Uh, yeah, breadsticks and stuff.
118440	121800	Yeah, when you came walking up to the door you had like two pizza boxes, I'm like damn
121800	124800	Loki, you're fat.
124800	126400	Fat with a pH, Loki.
126400	127400	You know I love ya.
127400	131960	But no, it was one pizza and one thing of breadsticks.
131960	135000	By the way, we here at OLR, for those of you on all games who haven't heard our show before,
135000	137280	we like food almost as much as we like video games.
137280	138480	So there you have it.
138480	141200	I especially like video games about food.
141200	143120	Like cooking mama.
143120	149920	You know how some people say that they like to, you know, watch porn while they do it?
149920	154020	I like to eat food while I'm playing video games about food.
154020	157600	So while you're like playing cooking mama, do you actually cook things that you're cooking
157600	158600	in cooking mama?
158600	163400	No, however, it did inspire me to try to make one of the dishes once.
163400	164700	We should try that one night.
164700	167960	We should do some, you know, cooking mama, like for reals.
167960	173040	The instructions in that game are actually semi-realistic, given that those are, a lot
173040	177320	of those dishes are stuff I make anyway, because I'm an awesome cook.
177320	178320	And so humble.
178320	185320	I know, I am, but it's the same type of thing, you know, the same situation, you know, to
185320	188840	watch something and then, you know, participate, sort of.
188840	192000	Well, we have a cooking mama related story tonight as well.
192000	193000	We do.
193000	195640	Sort of, distantly, but it is a cooking mama related thing.
195640	196720	We'll get into that later.
196720	201260	Also tonight we have Farbz, but you know him as the man behind Rom Check Fail, which was
201260	202260	written by one man.
202260	205080	We'll tell you more about that a little bit later on in the program.
205080	209400	Also, we're live and streaming on Justin TV, if you want to see our ugly mugs on the cam.
209400	212200	We're over there at Justin TV, Orange Lounge Radio.
212200	215080	But we're going to start off tonight's show as we always do, talking a little bit about
215080	216080	our gaming weeks.
216080	219960	How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
219960	221440	It was meaty, no.
221440	222440	So meaty.
222440	227560	Now, my gaming week was actually, I know I always say it's pinball oriented, but this
227560	230160	week was especially pinball oriented.
230160	236680	Because Dan is hosting his pinball group gathering tonight.
236680	241940	Hence another reason why I, you know, feel very blessed to be here tonight.
241940	246600	So I had to be around loud stranger men that I don't know.
246600	252600	Anyway, so a lot of the week was actually spent testing out after shopping out some
252600	253960	of the tables.
253960	258480	We've had his friend Will's Judge Dredd torn apart all over our garage right now and they
258480	261240	just put it back together today and I hate that table.
261240	269440	Anyway, we also went to one of our local used movie CD places called Dimple and we almost
269440	271720	picked up some 7800 games.
271720	274440	But then we remembered that we probably already owned them.
274440	279960	Because the way you know that you have too much in your collection is when you have to
279960	285160	actually stop and ask yourself, do I own this or even worse, how many copies of this do
285160	287320	I already have?
287320	290880	I've come home with a game for Dan and now the unique thing about it is that I did have
290880	291880	the manual in the box.
291880	293160	It's a 5200 game.
293160	296560	We had three other copies of it.
296560	300400	You need to get one of those little personal organizers just for your video game collection
300400	303220	so you can actually pull up an Excel spreadsheet on the go.
303220	304640	Do I have this game?
304640	305920	Does it have the manual with it?
305920	306920	Yes or no?
306920	310820	That's a pretty hardcore video game collector.
310820	315200	We actually did have a list like that for a while and then I think we lost it in a computer
315200	320760	crash and then we just were sort of like, you've seen our vault.
320760	329240	We have an entire room dedicated to the collection and it's sort of overwhelming now.
329240	330240	Actually a lot overwhelming.
330240	333120	Have you ever thought like, one of these days we just need to get rid of this shit.
333120	336200	We need to call the 1-800 got junk people or whatever it is.
336200	337200	Bite your tongue.
337200	338200	Ow.
338200	339200	It has been bitten.
339200	343560	Dan has said that we should get rid of some of it and I'm like, you touch that collection
343560	352000	I kill you and then when you're dead it's all mine.
352000	354520	He'll divorce him when he's dead and then take over the collection.
354520	357800	Well when he's dead I'm actually putting him in his Mustang driving it off a cliff and
357800	359240	exploding it in mid-air.
359240	360240	That's what he wants.
360240	364000	I am the best wife ever.
364000	366640	Something tells me you're out of video games to talk about so we're going to move over
366640	370960	to, now she's like talking about these Thelma and Louise inspired things, I don't know,
370960	371960	so we're going to go over.
371960	372960	What's this idea?
372960	373960	Loki.
373960	376520	Do I want to buy a Virtual Boy system?
376520	377520	That's what I need to know.
377520	379400	Yes, you do want a Virtual Boy system.
379400	381560	How much do they want for it?
381560	382560	$75.
382560	385200	No, actually wait I'm sorry I read that wrong.
385200	389600	I would be about $84.
389600	392760	Is that something you're looking at on eBay right now or something?
392760	393760	Yes.
393760	396960	Well now that you just said that on air everybody else is going to go look that up and jack
396960	397960	the price up.
397960	398960	Let's buy it now.
398960	399960	Oh, buy it now.
399960	403560	I don't know, it's a piece of gaming history.
403560	407800	I have the Vectrex too and I can't turn it, see I want a game system that I can leave
407800	412240	running on my desk all day long so people can come and play it but the Vectrex makes
412240	419720	it really loud like the entire time that it's going so that and there's no real like demo
419720	423560	loop or anything it just keeps playing the game over and over until you actually touch
423560	424560	it.
424560	425560	Isn't that a demo loop?
425560	431800	No, because you have to play in other words you keep dying because there's no demo loop
431800	432940	but.
432940	436360	Have you ever thought of actually just like building like a mock cabinet and having to
436360	438720	something that cycles like an emulator?
438720	443360	No, I don't want to build a cabinet for my desk because I think they'd be like what the
443360	444800	hell's that?
444800	445800	In the office.
445800	448040	It's my new arcade cabinet.
448040	449040	Don't touch my arcade cabinet.
449040	450600	No, but actually stuff that I played this week.
450600	454160	I was going to say, you know, we here on Orange Launch Radio, we like to stay on the current
454160	458200	news too, not just, you know, Virtual Boys and Atari 7800s, have you been playing like
458200	461280	360, Wii, any of that stuff?
461280	464960	This week I've only played two things, unfortunately.
464960	467420	First one of course is multiplayer Saints Rokes.
467420	471400	We're still playing that damn game until we can get Grand Theft Auto IV, which I did find
471400	477760	out today, well not today, but earlier this week that my boss is going to buy me a special
477760	481640	edition of Grand Theft Auto IV, so that's awesome, but at the same time I already preordered
481640	485940	another one just because, you know, we're going to need some for multiplayer.
485940	491640	And I think I need about two to three more copies on top of those too, so five somewhere
491640	492640	around there.
492640	496280	That reminds me I still have to fix my other 360.
496280	503320	And then, other than Saints Row, I did play Mario Kart Wii, a lot of Mario Kart Wii, in
503320	512600	fact I've already finished 50cc and 100cc, of course imported from the UK.
512600	516040	And well, what can I say about the game, it's Mario Kart.
516040	519560	I like some of the new levels that are in there, I think they're really cool.
519560	523760	The only thing that, a couple gripes I have about the game, some of the levels that they
523760	528840	chose, like the classic levels, are kind of stupid choices.
528840	532600	They're not, well Rainbow Road's kind of annoying, but you know, that's just Rainbow Road, but
532600	536480	a lot of the like, especially even the battle modes, like the battle courses that they chose
536480	538220	are just kind of crappy.
538220	539800	Which Rainbow Road did they bring over?
539800	543480	They have the new Rainbow Road, there is no older one.
543480	544480	And it's annoying.
544480	546360	Well Rainbow Road always is.
546360	551280	No, but like some of the battle courses that they brought over, they brought over like,
551280	555000	I don't know, just some of the lamest ones from the other games.
555000	559880	And I really think they could have chose some better tracks as well from like the classic
559880	560880	stuff.
560880	564720	Because there's a lot that just kind of resemble other tracks in the game that are already
564720	565720	there.
565720	570320	I mean there's three tracks that are kind of like the Donkey Kong, what was it, the
570320	572640	one from Double Dash.
572640	576680	They're kind of like that, where you have the giant cannon that launches you to the
576680	579680	top of the track and you race down back to the cannon and stuff.
579680	582000	So it's alright.
582000	584280	Some other weird gripes about it.
584280	586440	Battle mode is only team based.
586440	590640	You cannot play against, you know, individual people.
590640	591640	What?
591640	592640	Yeah.
592640	594760	You can only play against, you have to be on one team or the other.
594760	598560	So if you have three people or four people and you want to battle each other, well you
598560	599560	can't.
599560	601360	You have to be on two man teams.
601360	602360	That sucks.
602360	603360	Yeah, it's retarded.
603360	604360	I wonder why they did that.
604360	607920	You would think that's something that, you know, doesn't take a whole lot of extra programming.
607920	608920	Oh yeah.
608920	609920	It's lazy.
609920	610920	That's all it is.
610920	611920	Interesting.
611920	612920	That's a weird change.
612920	613920	Yeah.
613920	614920	So that sucks.
614920	619600	Other than that though, you can customize a lot of stuff in there, like different item
619600	620600	drops.
620600	626860	But, you know, I tried some of the ones that drop like the really supposedly big items,
626860	632440	like the more powerful items more frequently versus the normal drops and I didn't notice
632440	633440	a difference.
633440	634600	So I don't know.
634600	636400	It's not very useful.
636400	638480	But tried online a little bit.
638480	641400	I was hardly able to get into any games right now.
641400	645440	Online is kind of crappy as far as connecting to a game, but once you're in the game, it's
645440	646720	fine.
646720	649680	I like the way that they have it where you pick courses and stuff.
649680	655000	You basically choose a course that you want, then the computer randomly selects which player's
655000	656620	choice gets picked and stuff.
656620	657620	So that's kind of neat.
657620	659680	Now obviously you have no friends to play against right now, right?
659680	660680	So you're just playing the...
660680	661860	I'm just playing against random people worldwide.
661860	662860	And it's working okay?
662860	664320	I'm surprised there's enough people on there.
664320	665320	But I guess since the game's...
665320	666320	No, there's a ton of people on there.
666320	667800	Since the game's out in the UK and stuff.
667800	671040	It's out in the UK and Japan already.
671040	675800	Two-thirds of the world has it, but just not the US yet.
675800	676800	But yeah, it's okay.
676800	678520	I'm not very good at...
678520	685960	I like playing as Yoshi or the medium karts, so it's not very fast and I get beat pretty
685960	687360	quick sometimes.
687360	689000	But I like the tracks.
689000	694480	Some of the meat integration in the game is pretty funny, especially there's a mall level
694480	695480	that you play in.
695480	699240	And there's a bunch of signs and stuff that are all throughout the mall with different
699240	700240	Miis on there.
700240	702240	And it's randomly selected each time you play the game.
702240	707200	So there was one that I was driving through the very first time I played at the mall.
707200	710560	My Chuck Norris Mii was on the coffee.
710560	711560	There's a coffee advertisement.
711560	714320	And then there's another one with Jesus on there.
714320	719080	And then later on in the level you saw Hitler driving a car and stuff.
719080	720880	Just absolutely funny stuff.
720880	721880	Nice.
721880	726480	And there's Goat Say Mii driving a car one time, but for some reason it likes selecting
726480	728360	Saddam and Hitler Miis.
728360	731280	I don't know why, but I see them the most frequent.
731280	733600	Did you get the Bobby Black Wolf Mii to show up at some point?
733600	737760	Like, you know, Saddam, Hitler, and Bobby Black Wolf all driving cars with the Goat
737760	738760	Say?
738760	739760	Goat Say Man?
739760	743560	You know, he might have been in there somewhere, but I don't remember exactly what his Mii
743560	745960	looks like, so I have to see.
745960	747080	It looks like him, dummy!
747080	751040	Well, I know it looks like him, duh, but I have a ton of Miis and, you know, they all
751040	755160	kind of look similar to different things, so, you know, it's hard to pick out.
755160	757560	I'm like, is that Rob, or is that Shane?
757560	758880	I'm not sure, you know.
758880	760520	Well, let's get this thing.
760520	763200	Shane, black hair, Rob, reddish-brown hair.
763200	764200	It's not that hard.
764200	765200	Well, you're driving my stuff really fast, okay?
765200	767120	You can't just, like, stop and, like, hmm.
767120	771120	I think that my Mii is very recognizable, but then again she's also scowling.
771120	772120	Yeah, yeah.
772120	773120	I love Dark Soccer's Mii.
773120	776120	Her Mii was in a car one time, so that was funny.
776120	779760	Dark Soccer's Mii always looks angry, because she picked the little pointy eyebrows to make
779760	781560	her look mad all the time, which is great.
781560	787800	So yeah, you can play the game, and then eventually you unlock the Mii, the drive S, which, here's
787800	792200	my other gripe, and I haven't, I could be wrong about this, but I haven't tried multiplayer
792200	794120	with it yet.
794120	797960	In single player, when you're playing as the Mii character, you can't select which Mii
797960	798960	it uses.
798960	801400	It's only the one that you assign to your license.
801400	806840	So you can't swap it between other things, which is another lazy thing that they've done.
806840	811360	And it also has the most retarded voice I've ever heard for a character.
811360	814240	It's like a retarded Mario voice.
814240	815800	It's like, ehhhhh.
815800	818980	It's like, what the hell is that?
818980	820880	It sounds like goat boy Mii or something.
820880	822120	What the hell is that?
822120	823120	I don't know, but hopefully...
823120	825120	Can you make that sound again for us?
825120	826120	Ehhhhh.
826120	827120	There you go.
827120	828920	So I don't know.
828920	829920	I like the game.
829920	835440	I like it a lot better than Smash Brothers, but I love Mario Kart, so what can I say?
835440	839360	Well Bobby is in chat right now at chat.orangelaundry.com, defending himself a little bit.
839360	843280	We'll let him have the first comment on allgames.com, because he is the show that precedes us after
843280	847640	all over on allgames.com, Bobby Black Wolf Show, which starts an hour before we do here
847640	848640	on allgames.com.
848640	853560	He says, my Mii looks like Jesus to some people, so maybe when you were driving by really fast,
853560	856880	what actually you thought was Jesus was just Bobby.
856880	857880	It could have been.
857880	858880	Possibly.
858880	861720	Looking at some other comments, some folks were talking about Mario Kart Double Dash,
861720	865040	because not everybody's played Mario Kart Wii yet, obviously, so it's been inspiring
865040	870160	some talk about Mario Kart Double Dash, and Osfer speaking up for Double Dash, saying
870160	875080	Double Dash was some fun shit, and Sephiroth1215 saying, yeah, see, I really don't understand
875080	877600	why people don't like Double Dash.
877600	878600	It was okay.
878600	879600	It's just, okay.
879600	882480	The thing I didn't like about Double Dash is the battle mode really sucked.
882480	885760	Like the levels that they made for it just awful.
885760	890880	And even some of the levels in, oh that's the other thing too about, and I, you know,
890880	895920	I don't remember the other Mario games too well, the Mario Kart games, but from what
895920	902440	I remember before, you didn't have a point limit or a time limit, so in the battle mode
902440	906000	this time, you have a three minute time limit for each game that you play.
906000	912280	You can't just keep playing until, you know, someone loses, which is kind of lame.
912280	916280	And when you lose all your balloons, you just get them all back, and it just keeps counting
916280	919440	more scores, so the balloons are kind of pointless too.
919440	920440	Interesting.
920440	921440	Yeah.
921440	925440	But I like what they've done with the levels, like where you can go up like half pipes almost
925440	926560	and do tricks and stuff.
926560	927740	That's pretty cool.
927740	930100	And there are some, you know, neat things.
930100	933560	The motorcycles I don't really dig very much.
933560	937720	I think that's kind of a dumb addition, and I tried playing it the steering wheel method,
937720	938720	and I hate it.
938720	939720	It's awful.
939720	944240	But the good news is though, for those that may have heard different stories claiming
944240	947600	otherwise, the classic controller and the GameCube controller are not gimped in any
947600	951320	way whatsoever, so you can play them just fine with it.
951320	952320	Really?
952320	953320	In fact, I use the classic controller.
953320	956200	But I mentioned there's got to be a huge difference between using an analog stick to control something
956200	957200	and using the motion.
957200	958400	There's got to be a huge difference.
958400	959400	Yeah.
959400	960400	I don't like the motion at all.
960400	961400	Interesting.
961400	966400	And doing all the gestures that do different things, it's not very fun, so I prefer the
966400	967920	classic controller of the GameCube.
967920	971520	Okay, so to kind of sum up this game review here that you're ending up giving us on Mario
971520	972520	Kart Wii, what would you say?
972520	974120	Is it better than Double Dash?
974120	975840	Are fans of Mario Kart going to like it?
975840	976840	Do you recommend it?
976840	981000	Yeah, I'd say it's better than Double Dash because it doesn't have two characters anymore
981000	983160	and that kind of is stupid in the first place.
983160	984720	And they killed Toadette off, hopefully.
984720	985720	Yeah, I think so.
985720	987720	I can't stand Toadette.
987720	988720	Toadette sucks.
988720	990920	Definitely, if you like Mario Kart, you're going to like this game.
990920	994760	The fact that it has online is going to be pretty cool.
994760	999040	There has been some cheating online, but we'll get into that a little bit later.
999040	1002500	Thankfully they fixed that.
1002500	1005520	But I don't know, overall it's a pretty cool game.
1005520	1008040	I just wish there were some better tracks.
1008040	1010640	Some of the classic tracks that they picked were kind of stupid.
1010640	1014900	Just like kind of, well this track's easy, the remake, so let's just pick this one instead
1014900	1016880	of actually picking good tracks.
1016880	1018840	That's my only gripe.
1018840	1021240	But other than that, it is an awesome game.
1021240	1022240	Alright.
1022240	1026920	Well, moving on to my gaming week, I was just bitching at Loki for talking about classics
1026920	1030080	too much, but that's actually kind of what I ended up playing this week because if you
1030080	1033000	were listening last week, you know I've been sick for a little while now and I was actually
1033000	1034880	at my parents' house this week recovering.
1034880	1039920	And so there are no video games in my parents' place and I lost my freaking DS charger.
1039920	1040920	And here's the weird thing.
1040920	1044920	Do you know that Target and Walmart, both those stores, they do not carry DS chargers.
1044920	1050360	They carry the car chargers, but they don't carry the ones you can plug in the wall.
1050360	1053800	And I wasn't able to convince them to take me over to a GameStop or whatever, so I was
1053800	1056760	just like, alright, so I'm just gonna, I guess, watch TV.
1056760	1061480	And then it dawned on me, even though my parents, they only have a 56.6K dial-up connection
1061480	1062480	to the internet.
1062480	1063960	Oh my god, so slow.
1063960	1065340	When you're spoiled with broadband.
1065340	1067480	But they have the 56.6K connection to the internet.
1067480	1069840	I downloaded emulators.
1069840	1072680	And so I went to town on some Super Nintendo games I'd missed and the one I probably played
1072680	1073680	the most of was Soul Blazer.
1073680	1075960	I don't know if you guys remember this game at all.
1075960	1079800	It was kind of in that same series-ish that Illusion of Gaia and Terranigma and some of
1079800	1080800	these other games were.
1080800	1081800	I remember.
1081800	1087320	Soul Blazer was like the first in that game by Enix, you know, way back in the day.
1087320	1091560	Basically you could kind of call it a Zelda-ish type of game.
1091560	1095800	You go in these action stages and as you kill these monsters that come out of the lair,
1095800	1099480	you free souls that might unlock something in the town.
1099480	1101920	But the towns and the dungeons are sort of related.
1101920	1105600	So like, you know, like in the dungeon, for instance, there's one part where an elevator
1105600	1106840	is broken and it doesn't work.
1106840	1110920	Well you have to release the soul of the man who runs the water well to get him to start
1110920	1113400	the water well again so the elevator works.
1113400	1114740	There's weird little connections like that.
1114740	1118820	But the game has a surprising amount of depth to it with the story for a Super Nintendo
1118820	1119820	game.
1119820	1124400	I'm reviewing a classic, but it is one of my all-time favorite Super Nintendo games.
1124400	1129480	Because in the story, the hero can talk to, he's kind of like a servant of God, quote
1129480	1135960	unquote, whatever you want to call it, and he can talk to dogs and cats and goats and
1135960	1138080	plants the same way that he talks to humans.
1138080	1140160	So it's very interesting the way they've written the story.
1140160	1141160	Do you know the cleric?
1141160	1143880	Sort of, but I don't think that's what he's called in the game.
1143880	1146920	He's just a hero is what he's called.
1146920	1147920	He's a goat whisperer.
1147920	1151960	Well in my game, he was called Butters because you can name him whatever you want, so I named
1151960	1154160	him Butters because I like that name.
1154160	1157480	So yeah, so I played a lot of Soul Blazer this week.
1157480	1162680	And otherwise, as far as newer games go, I went back to an MMO this week that I haven't
1162680	1163680	played in a while.
1163680	1165600	I hope it's not Final Fantasy XI.
1165600	1167720	It is not Final Fantasy XI.
1167720	1169000	But you would still be surprised.
1169000	1171240	You know what MMO I played this week that I haven't played?
1171240	1172240	PSN Blue Burst?
1172240	1173240	Close.
1173240	1174240	Phantasy Star Universe.
1174240	1175240	Julie said she saw you on.
1175240	1177680	Yep, I played Phantasy Star Universe for a little while.
1177680	1181200	She came over to show me the free server she's playing on for Blue Burst.
1181200	1185700	Sega apparently is cool with people being on the free servers now and has character
1185700	1186700	transfer tools.
1186700	1188400	Dang, that's kind of rad.
1188400	1189400	Yeah.
1189400	1190400	That's nice of them.
1190400	1192320	But she said she saw you on.
1192320	1193320	Yes.
1193320	1194320	Rob's playing PSU again?
1194320	1195320	Cool.
1195320	1196320	I need to play with him.
1196320	1201040	I actually downloaded the expansion, the Ambition of the Illuminous, or whatever it's called.
1201040	1203480	I've always jokingly called it the abortion of the Illuminous.
1203480	1204480	Well not on Xbox 360.
1204480	1205480	You can't get it.
1205480	1206480	Really?
1206480	1207480	I could have gotten it free for free.
1207480	1208480	Alright, that's alright.
1208480	1210360	I got it anyway.
1210360	1213240	I haven't gotten to explore it a whole lot, but I will say this.
1213240	1218320	I've kind of enjoyed the way that the online story, because the game's changed a lot since
1218320	1221440	I last, because I played for about a month after it first came out, and then I just stopped
1221440	1222440	because I was kind of getting old.
1222440	1226480	It felt like the same grind over and over, but they've really expanded a story that begins
1226480	1232320	on the disc of the game, Phantasy Star Universe, is this very anime style story with this grand
1232320	1233840	introduction and everything.
1233840	1238040	The neat thing about PSU is that it keeps expanding the story on in the online mode,
1238040	1244680	so you literally start chapter two or the second series online, and it's a continuation
1244680	1245840	of the first series.
1245840	1249900	And then this whole Ambition of the Illuminous is the third series, and it even comes with
1249900	1254000	its own cutscenes, new introduction, and all this other cool stuff.
1254000	1257160	So I thought it was kind of interesting.
1257160	1261160	I have not yet though gotten the mag and all this other stuff that supposedly PSU is bringing
1261160	1263840	back some of the old school stuff from Phantasy Star Online, but I'm not that far enough yet.
1263840	1265880	They've got the original four stages too.
1265880	1270280	I know that the people that are probably, if you're looking to play this game and you
1270280	1272040	haven't done it yet, it's like 20 bucks now.
1272040	1273040	It's very cheap.
1273040	1277360	And Rob, kaths can use four skills now.
1277360	1279680	It's about time.
1279680	1285320	Speaking of crack that I used to be on gaming-wise, speaking of Final Fantasy XI as well, I also
1285320	1289960	noticed, I didn't realize this came out, there's a new combo disc that came out for the Xbox
1289960	1294720	360 that combines Final Fantasy XI and every single expansion, including the new Wings
1294720	1297840	of the Goddess, only $29.99 on Xbox 360.
1297840	1301200	Not too bad of a deal, I got to say, if you want to get sucked into that crack.
1301200	1304680	So you have several MMO crack things to choose from on the Xbox 360.
1304680	1306400	All right, that's going to do it for our gaming week.
1306400	1309640	That was quite a bit tonight, but we had a lot of games to talk about.
1309640	1311640	Let's talk about some housekeeping news.
1311640	1315720	Of course, last night the plug was pulled on our Live 365 feed.
1315720	1317880	It's no longer there.
1317880	1321920	Gaming and Live 365, oh my god.
1321920	1324520	I wrote them a cancellation email a week ago.
1324520	1326520	You're supposed to give them three business days to cancel, right?
1326520	1328680	I wrote them an email a week ago, no response.
1328680	1331760	Wrote them a second notice, like Thursday or Friday, no response.
1331760	1333400	Guess who charged my card today?
1333400	1334400	The butt heads.
1334400	1336880	This is a fun ever start.
1336880	1340160	I'll keep you guys posted next week, what happens with that?
1340160	1345040	We might have to get nasty if things keep going down this route, because essentially
1345040	1347880	they've taken money from me that I didn't pay for.
1347880	1349400	It's kind of pissing me off.
1349400	1352260	Call your bank and stop payment.
1352260	1356720	So hello to AllGames.com, our new home, which has deducted no money from my bank account
1356720	1361700	this week, thankfully, because there are great people over at AllGames.com who aren't sucking
1361700	1365480	my money away, and they're friends, and we definitely urge you to check out the programming
1365480	1366900	that's at AllGames.com.
1366900	1368920	They have something new every night.
1368920	1372200	They re-air a bunch of podcasts that go on throughout the week.
1372200	1375840	Some of them have their debut on All Games Radio, so check that out.
1375840	1378760	We debut, of course, Sunday nights before us, Bobby Black Wolf.
1378760	1383520	In the morning times, All Games Interactive is on like every day, Monday through Friday.
1383520	1388200	So that shows on, I think, like 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and they go through most of the morning,
1388200	1391240	which would be actually early afternoon for the East Coast folks, so it really works out
1391240	1395400	great for the East Coast folks who have to stay up really late to listen to us.
1395400	1399080	And again, we want to remind you, we have a special guest tonight, Farbz of Romcheck
1399080	1403080	Fail fame, and if you like Orange Lounge Radio, you want to get to know us a little better,
1403080	1405000	join our social networking.
1405000	1406000	That's right.
1406000	1408320	We're MySpace whores just like everybody else, and Facebook and all that other stuff.
1408320	1411080	Our MySpace is MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1411080	1415560	We also have a live journal community at Orange Lounge, no radio, and Facebook.
1415560	1419880	Just search for OL Army, and you can add us on all those sites, and stay tuned with all
1419880	1424140	the news, and when we shift networks and all that stuff, you'll be on top of things and
1424140	1425140	know where to catch us.
1425140	1429920	Apparently, the chat room is loving the new sound, by the way, because our feed now is
1429920	1436920	96k, so it's a lot clearer, the feed, than the 64k we were on with Live 365, so they're
1436920	1438200	really happy with that.
1438200	1441600	And I think our podcast listeners are going to notice we also changed the audio on the
1441600	1446360	podcast to be similar to what we're broadcasting at now, so it's going to be a whole new sound.
1446360	1447360	That's okay, Rob.
1447360	1448360	I'll just talk like this.
1448360	1451360	We'll ruin the audio quality of the show this way.
1451360	1453360	Yeah, we'll just do it this way.
1453360	1459000	Alright, how about you get into some great new news tonight, will ya, ladies and gentlemen?
1459000	1460120	Anyways, let's see.
1460120	1466600	So this week, the publisher of Famitsu Magazine thinks that they have an idea of what may
1466600	1470200	be happening in E3 this year, one of the announcements.
1470200	1477200	Their guess is that Nintendo is going to be announcing yet another revision of the DS,
1477200	1481720	and their thinking behind this is because the timing seems to be right.
1481720	1488440	Apparently, every two years or so is when they revise their portable systems.
1488440	1496540	So for example, there is the 1996 Game Boy Pocket, and then in 98 there was the Game
1496540	1501640	Boy Color, and then of course in 2001 there was the Game Boy Advance, in 2003 there was
1501640	1509600	the Game Boy Advance SP, in 2004 there was DS, and then in 2006 there was DS Lite, so
1509600	1516360	2008, obviously since the DS is doing extremely well, they wouldn't probably introduce a new
1516360	1522440	system, but maybe another revision, maybe a yet slimmer and something with storage that
1522440	1526080	could possibly download something off the Virtual Console or something like that.
1526080	1527640	The DS Micro.
1527640	1528640	Who knows?
1528640	1531520	Or maybe they'll just do nothing and won't they feel stupid.
1531520	1536960	Okay, so in other words, Famitsu Magazine is basically saying this, Nintendo likes to
1536960	1540640	redo shit and make you buy it all over again, all the time.
1540640	1545680	So 2008 will be nothing new, is essentially what they're saying, and this is news how?
1545680	1547680	I don't know.
1547680	1554680	It's news because, I don't know, because we're talking about E3, and people like talking
1554680	1555680	about E3.
1555680	1561520	Odd1 says, but this time it's got, what the hell else can they do to this thing other
1561520	1563880	than make it smaller or give it storage?
1563880	1565560	Ah, there's a thought.
1565560	1571520	What about turning the DS a little bit PSP-ish, where, hey, not only is it a DS, but it plays
1571520	1574200	MP3s and it has scheduling things.
1574200	1576160	I would refuse to buy one if it does that.
1576160	1577160	Or here's something...
1577160	1578160	Wait, wait.
1578160	1579160	I gotta know this.
1579160	1580160	Why is that?
1580160	1581940	Because it's the same reason why I'm not too fond of the PSP.
1581940	1583440	It's got way too much shit in it.
1583440	1586840	If I want to play a game, I want a system that plays a game.
1586840	1588720	I have an iPhone already, hello?
1588720	1589720	I have to be honest.
1589720	1593320	That's kind of one thing I like about the PSP is that it's a little bit of everything.
1593320	1594320	You know what I mean?
1594320	1595320	I think it's kind of neat.
1595320	1598720	If you want your video game system to have everything, then that's fine.
1598720	1600120	If that's what you want.
1600120	1605640	But for me personally, because I already have the means to do all this other stuff, I really
1605640	1608080	just want my system to play my video games.
1608080	1615100	Here's something, a thought, and I could see this happening more than I could see, say,
1615100	1616680	a new system coming out.
1616680	1620880	Maybe an expansion that would plug into the bottom of the Game Boy Advance slot or whatever,
1620880	1624400	and you would plug in your SD memory card because, guess what, you have an SD memory
1624400	1630760	card slot on your Wii and so maybe this, I don't know, device or whatever that you plug
1630760	1636800	into the bottom, that is flashable and that you can have firmware upgrades to and whatnot
1636800	1642640	to allow it to play, like say, emulate different games like the Virtual Console or stuff like
1642640	1645960	that or WiiWare or something like that.
1645960	1648520	I could see that happening because that would be a little easier.
1648520	1651880	They can't just get rid of, like if they make it any slimmer, they're going to get rid of
1651880	1655280	the Game Boy Advance slot, then you're going to have stuff that uses it, like say Guitar
1655280	1659440	Hero on Tour, I don't know if they're going to screw that over because that would be good
1659440	1664600	for them, they can't get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot just yet.
1664600	1670560	It's an interesting thought, but why would they do this when they could release games
1670560	1674000	on the, I mean they did this for the Game Boy Advance, they released their classic series
1674000	1675000	games.
1675000	1678480	Remember the classic series games that came out on the Game Boy Advance?
1678480	1682140	Like you could get classic Donkey Kong or classic Metroid even though you could unlock
1682140	1684220	it in another game, right?
1684220	1687080	You get these classic games and they were charging like $19.99 for them.
1687080	1690120	So why would they give you a device where you could get all this shit basically for
1690120	1695120	free from the Virtual Console when they could recharge for it and people would buy it?
1695120	1696960	Well, because I don't think people would buy it.
1696960	1702040	I think people would rather have a service available where they can download all these
1702040	1707100	games, and I think you get a lot more people downloading games, it's a lot easier to download
1707100	1710480	games on the Virtual Console and pay a lot more money that way.
1710480	1716320	That also saves them packaging, they don't have to press any of these stupid cartridges.
1716320	1719560	I think the packaging and stuff, that would save them a lot of money, and it doesn't really
1719560	1722400	cost them anything to transfer a file.
1722400	1728880	It's just, you know, basically what they're gonna probably want to do is prevent people
1728880	1731320	from pirating this stuff, and that's about it.
1731320	1737200	Because, you know, right now with those other SD memory card things, yeah, you can pirate
1737200	1742200	games like, you know, no end, but they'd have to create something that you wouldn't be able
1742200	1744200	to do that.
1744200	1745200	Well we'll see what happens.
1745200	1748080	And besides, think of all the other things you could do, I mean, it's essentially just
1748080	1753560	like that PlayOn thing that they have available now, you could use it as Game Boy, you know,
1753560	1758700	not necessarily for Virtual Console games and stuff like that, MP3s, you can use it
1758700	1763160	for like maybe small media files, you know, playing a really, really, really low res movie
1763160	1769920	or something like that, you know, like think, I don't know, your cartoons.
1769920	1771840	They had that on the Game Boy Advance, remember those?
1771840	1775560	They still sell those at like Walmart and stuff, you can get the couple episodes of
1775560	1779120	Kim Possible or whatever on an Advance cart, and you can watch those movies.
1779120	1783240	Or, you know, just like an iPod, you know, Nano or something like that with a tiny ass
1783240	1786840	screen on it, you know, you can do something like that.
1786840	1789400	As long as it shuts the kids up in the backseat of the car, right?
1789400	1790400	Exactly.
1790400	1793280	Well this is something that will shut a lot of people up for a while, it's Final Fantasy
1793280	1795880	4, and the reason why I say that is because once you start playing this game, you get
1795880	1797420	sucked into it for a while.
1797420	1800120	It's a pretty epic RPG, one of my favorites on the Super Nintendo.
1800120	1803740	I can't wait to play the new version on the DS, and we talked about this a little bit
1803740	1808020	last week, and this is a bit of a follow-up, is that there was a rumor that Final Fantasy
1808020	1811240	4 was, yes, it's going to be North American bound because it showed up on the cover, Nintendo
1811240	1816080	Power and all this stuff, well Squeenix confirmed it this week, Final Fantasy 4 will be coming
1816080	1821200	out July 22nd in North America, which is a little bit off from the date I seem to recall
1821200	1822200	Loki mentioning.
1822200	1824080	Well, they revised it, bumped it up a week.
1824080	1825520	All because of you, probably, right?
1825520	1826520	Yeah.
1826520	1827520	Just kidding.
1827520	1831580	It is, of course, Final Fantasy 4 with some graphical upgrades, they also have, get this
1831580	1837640	fully voiced cutscenes and other added content, so that's going to be interesting, this whole
1837640	1838640	mini movie thing.
1838640	1843400	And then my mistake from last week, it wasn't Dragon Quest V, it was Dragon Quest IV.
1843400	1845320	Oh, okay.
1845320	1848160	That is also on its way, but that's secret type thing, right?
1848160	1849160	Shhh.
1849160	1850160	Secret.
1850160	1851160	Secret.
1851160	1852160	Okay.
1852160	1855200	All right, so we'll see what happens next from Squeenix, I guess that's probably why
1855200	1858440	this game has taken a long time to come out from Japan to the US is because they're having
1858440	1862360	to redo the voices now too, which I'm sure can't be an easy thing on the DS because then
1862360	1867320	they have to go basically remake the whole cartridges and all that, so please voice acting,
1867320	1871800	don't suck in this, please do not ruin my fond fond memories of Final Fantasy 4 or I'll
1871800	1872800	cry.
1872800	1875440	I don't know why they can't leave it intact.
1875440	1876440	But no.
1876440	1877440	But no.
1877440	1879860	Maybe the classic version will be in there somewhere, I don't know.
1879860	1880860	One can hope.
1880860	1887280	Well, at any rate, something else that has made a lot of people on the internet go Squee,
1887280	1892840	is a, but not Squeenix, okay, is a strong bad game coming to WiiWare, and I am very
1892840	1893840	happy about this.
1893840	1894840	Did you watch the trailer?
1894840	1899560	I have not seen the trailer yet, remember I was on 56.6K most of the week.
1899560	1905400	The trailer is hilarious, but there is a game coming out called Strong Bad's Cool Game for
1905400	1907800	Attractive People.
1907800	1908800	Which is, yeah.
1908800	1911640	Aw, I'm sorry, Loki, you can't play.
1911640	1913600	That's alright.
1913600	1923080	Or if you're, you know, super cool, as the trailer says, it's SBCG for AP.
1923080	1924080	So yeah.
1924080	1929160	But anyway, it's gonna be episodic games, gonna be out starting in June.
1929160	1935880	Being put out by Telltale Games, and it's five episode season, and it will be out once
1935880	1936880	a month.
1936880	1939920	And they're the ones that did the Sam and Max games.
1939920	1941160	Are they?
1941160	1942160	Interesting.
1942160	1945840	Speaking of which, that's Sam and Max for the Wii, that's season one.
1945840	1946840	Only.
1946840	1947840	Only season one.
1947840	1948840	Oh, thank you for the update.
1948840	1949840	Appreciate it.
1949840	1954200	But it should be reasonable.
1954200	1958920	Well there's gonna be a, the trailer is actually posted in our chat room right now, chat.orangelaunchvideo.com
1958920	1961840	from Tigerclaw, found it on YouTube and dug that up.
1961840	1964920	Going back to the last story, because there was a lot of comments from the voice chat
1964920	1969320	on Final Fantasy IV, going back to some comments from our chat room.
1969320	1973560	Let's see, Jonathan F. is fantasizing Final Fantasy VI with voices, because you would
1973560	1975940	have the opera scene with singing.
1975940	1977640	Celeste would actually sing the opera.
1977640	1979600	That could be, that could be, go either way.
1979600	1981640	That could be really good or really bad.
1981640	1984400	Well like, they could do it like, Dear Friends.
1984400	1987000	If they get real people to do it, yeah, well remember when we went to, it was More Friends,
1987000	1988680	not Dear Friends, but More Friends.
1988680	1989680	They did the opera live.
1989680	1990680	And it, it wasn't bad.
1990680	1992160	It was actually really good.
1992160	1993560	FootyMonster is happy about the cutscenes.
1993560	1995040	He says, voice cutscenes are awesome.
1995040	1996840	I'm very happy about this.
1996840	1998280	RawsteelUT, not so happy.
1998280	1999840	He says, voices on the DS?
1999840	2002040	That's gonna be massive compression.
2002040	2004080	But he says, ooh, Dragon Quest IV.
2004080	2008400	ShadowSlayer thinks it could be good if they get good voice actors.
2008400	2012480	Odd1 says, it's dependent on how big the card for the game is.
2012480	2016560	And Zeppelin says, why can't they put one to two gigabyte in a DS card?
2016560	2017920	I'm pretty sure they can, can't they?
2017920	2018920	I think they can.
2018920	2019920	Yeah, why not?
2019920	2023960	If your camera can fit like two gigabytes, I'm sure those DS cards can crank in like
2023960	2025360	four gigabytes on those cards.
2025360	2027760	You'd probably get some pretty massive games on there.
2027760	2028760	So.
2028760	2029760	Yeah.
2029760	2030760	So this is another rumor.
2030760	2032840	Oh, I'm sorry, was there more on the Strong Bad stuff?
2032840	2034400	I had more to say.
2034400	2035400	Oh, sure, sure.
2035400	2036400	But that's okay.
2036400	2038640	Well, there's nobody in chat commenting on it either.
2038640	2040240	What do you guys think of the Strong Bad game?
2040240	2044040	Oh, BlackWolf says the Strong Bad game is also coming to the PC.
2044040	2047080	So if you don't want to download that on the Wii, you can also get it on the PC.
2047080	2054120	Well, I was going to say the type of game is a 3D point, to actually quote a quote from
2054120	2059880	Strong Bad, okay, it is a puffy 3D point-and-click-em-up adventure.
2059880	2062680	You need to do it in the Strong Bad voice.
2062680	2063680	No.
2063680	2066560	Dan can do the Strong Bad voice.
2066560	2069400	I cannot.
2069400	2072560	You can turn the light switch on or off.
2072560	2073560	That's all I remember.
2073560	2074560	All right.
2074560	2078760	I did not install it so you could have a light switch rave.
2078760	2080000	What do you think?
2080000	2081000	Winner or sellout?
2081000	2082000	Winner!
2082000	2083000	Winner?
2083000	2084000	I hope so.
2084000	2085000	It all depends on the game.
2085000	2090580	But that's hopeful if it's the same folks that did Sam and Max, so we'll see.
2090580	2096280	Another game that hopefully will be coming soon, Elibits 2.
2096280	2102160	And of course, this is coming from the latest issue of the official Nintendo magazine, reporting
2102160	2108200	that Elibits 2 will be due out on the Wii later this year, which is odd because I thought
2108200	2111400	it was supposed to be due out on the DS later this year.
2111400	2118520	Either way, it'll be coming to a Nintendo system this year probably, and hopefully won't
2118520	2122800	be just mediocre like the last game.
2122800	2126000	I kind of like the last game with the level designs and stuff like that.
2126000	2130040	The last game was kind of neat, but there was something about it that didn't keep me
2130040	2131480	there long-term, you know what I mean?
2131480	2136080	I don't know if I just felt like there wasn't a lot to keep me going in that game, you know
2136080	2137080	what I mean?
2137080	2139520	Which is odd to say because there was the level editor and those things like that, but
2139520	2140520	I don't know.
2140520	2141920	It just kind of seemed like the game got kind of old.
2141920	2146160	The formula to the game got a little bit old to me, so hopefully they'll have some.
2146160	2150020	I mean, but think about how far the Wii has progressed since Elibits was...
2150020	2153200	It wasn't in the launch, but it was right after, right?
2153200	2154720	Didn't Elibits come out right after launch?
2154720	2157600	It was one of the first major games to come out after launch.
2157600	2159720	Now they have a lot more they can play with.
2159720	2164200	I'm sure technologies have come along and developed in the Wii games as well as online
2164200	2165200	possibly, which could be interesting.
2165200	2168400	I don't know what they could do with a DS version of the game, because a lot of that
2168400	2174480	game required you to be able to pull on the remote and twist it and stuff like that.
2174480	2182680	It'd be hard not to have that depth sensing that the Wii version had in the DS version.
2182680	2185960	Some comments from chat on Elibits, Sephiroth1215 not happy from this.
2185960	2192020	Ah no, I hate Elibits, and RawsteelUT says, it's Elibits, no one cares.
2192020	2195520	Frisbee wants to mention that it was a launch title in Japan.
2195520	2199440	Qualtippo says, Elibits seemed good at the time, but no staying power though.
2199440	2202800	And Gerardimo says, Elibits was good and innovative, just shallow.
2202800	2206080	That might actually be a good way of phrasing it.
2206080	2207080	But I don't know.
2207080	2209920	I mean, you really want to appreciate Elibits, but I don't know, it just kind of got old
2209920	2210920	quick.
2210920	2214160	Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join in the fun here on this Sunday night.
2214160	2217000	Remember we are on a new network, allgames.com.
2217000	2220360	At this time we're not, it's just too much to read the All Games chat and the Orange
2220360	2224760	Lounge chat and we have people chatting on Justin.TV as well who thinks I'm neglecting
2224760	2225880	them over on Justin.TV.
2225880	2231080	I'm not, it's just a lot to read and try to do a show at the same time and bring you more
2231080	2236360	gaming news like this one about the white GameCube controller.
2236360	2241140	That's right, there is a white GameCube controller coming out a little later this year if you
2241140	2242680	live in Japan.
2242680	2243680	That's the problem.
2243680	2246540	It's only going to come out for those of you guys in Japan.
2246540	2251080	It's a little weird though that this is just now coming out.
2251080	2254420	It's a white GameCube controller to match the Wii basically.
2254420	2257600	It is the same color as the Nintendo Wii.
2257600	2261240	And it's coming out for the games that will support the GameCube controller such as Super
2261240	2265880	Smash Brothers and now Mario Kart Wii we know is going to support the GameCube controller.
2265880	2268840	So there's a, this is going to be coming out in Japan.
2268840	2273820	But the odd thing is, why not a Wavebird controller that would make so much more sense because
2273820	2275820	the Wavebird was pretty awesome.
2275820	2278800	I don't know if it's a cost thing or what.
2278800	2281100	But who knows if this will be coming out here.
2281100	2282880	It's actually a lot sooner than later this year.
2282880	2287800	That is coming out later this month according to Nintendo of Japan's website.
2287800	2289880	So pretty cool.
2289880	2293840	I don't know, do you think they ought to bring Wavebirds, white Wavebirds to the Wii?
2293840	2296760	Or does it matter because if you didn't buy one-
2296760	2298840	There are Wavebirds?
2298840	2300680	Because there already are Wavebirds and if you weren't-
2300680	2302000	But they don't make them anymore.
2302000	2303000	So?
2303000	2307680	So you're basically saying screw you to everyone who didn't get one like me.
2307680	2308680	I can bring them over.
2308680	2309680	You suck.
2309680	2313660	But honestly, and I'll tell you this, remember when they came out with those different colored
2313660	2317480	controllers for the GameCube?
2317480	2324200	Well GameStop and a few other retailers were getting shipments of them.
2324200	2329520	They were even selling the spice color, the orange one basically, that we didn't technically
2329520	2331200	get a release of over here.
2331200	2336360	So I actually wouldn't be too surprised to see it at GameStop, GameCrazy, any of your
2336360	2339160	actual retailers.
2339160	2345260	And they actually get hori items too, to sell.
2345260	2348600	You sometimes see these little random import things too at random stores.
2348600	2349600	Just kind of have to look around.
2349600	2350600	You know what I mean?
2350600	2360160	So our oddest find as far as import anything went at actual GameStop was buying Capcom
2360160	2367480	Classic Collection Volume 2, which was the Ghosts and Goblins, the Makaimura, Daimakaimura.
2367480	2368600	But it never came out here, right?
2368600	2370520	No, we never got that collection.
2370520	2378320	We got the Japanese one at a GameStop in Hilltop Mall.
2378320	2381800	Several people in chat, by the way, mentioning that the Wavebirds did not have rumble.
2381800	2385240	Perhaps that's the reason Nintendo is deciding not to do it.
2385240	2389780	Because Sony learned the hard way, you gotta have rumble.
2389780	2394960	Rumble is not so last gen, as they tried to say at E3 a couple years ago.
2394960	2395960	They learned the hard way.
2395960	2396960	So maybe that's why.
2396960	2400760	But why, I mean, is a Wavebird with rumble that hard to do?
2400760	2402120	I mean is it?
2402120	2403120	I don't know.
2403120	2404120	Maybe it's just me.
2404120	2405120	It's impossible.
2405120	2409480	If the Xbox 360 wireless can do rumble, I would think.
2409480	2410920	Maybe it's just me.
2410920	2413200	It's not that hard.
2413200	2414200	I didn't think so.
2414200	2417560	I mean, I'm not even, no, no, no, no, no.
2417560	2418560	Alright, moving on.
2418560	2424520	I can't fathom why they think it'd be difficult, but anyway, for our Squenix fans out there,
2424520	2429760	and actually for anyone who is a fan of the manga series Soul Eater, there is going to
2429760	2435200	be a Soul Eater RPG out on the Wii, put out by Squenix.
2435200	2439080	And if you don't know anything about Soul Eater, there's a Wikipedia article, so enjoy.
2439080	2446800	But it will be coming to the US, and actually, my apologies, it's so far listed as Japan
2446800	2449960	only and I don't think it's going to be coming out anywhere else.
2449960	2450960	So.
2450960	2455840	I mean, because honestly, it has, I don't even think the Soul Eater manga's come out
2455840	2458400	over in the US, has it?
2458400	2460440	You're asking the wrong guy when it comes to manga.
2460440	2468440	The whole point of the, I guess, manga is that these people are going to this technical
2468440	2474640	school to make weapons and have to make this one weapon out of 99 evil human souls and
2474640	2477400	one belonging to this witch to make a death scythe.
2477400	2480760	Which I think death scythe, and I think back to Gundam Wing, so whatever.
2480760	2482600	Well the way you describe it, it sounds kind of cool.
2482600	2484200	Yeah, it would be something I would read.
2484200	2486200	But I don't know if that's something that would come out here.
2486200	2487200	No.
2487200	2492120	I mean, I don't know if, I'll read the manga I guess.
2492120	2495300	Well I guess it's nice to see Squeenix doing something that's, you know, outside of their
2495300	2497640	usual IPs, if nothing else, right?
2497640	2498640	Yeah.
2498640	2503040	I mean, how many actual manga adaptations in game have they really done?
2503040	2504040	I can't think of a lot.
2504040	2507840	But they've had their stuff done as manga.
2507840	2514400	It's better than continuing to bastardize the Blank of Mana series.
2514400	2517160	I almost bought that game on DS.
2517160	2518960	I'll never forgive them for that PlayStation 1.
2518960	2519960	What was PlayStation 1?
2519960	2520960	Was that Legend of Mana?
2520960	2521960	Legend of Mana.
2521960	2522960	Oh my god, I hated that game.
2522960	2523960	You know what my problem with Legend of Mana was?
2523960	2524960	I hated that game.
2524960	2525960	What?
2525960	2528240	Is I imported it like a dumbass.
2528240	2536000	And that was the most text-intensive, kanji-heavy game I have ever freaking played.
2536000	2540160	And I could read like five words on an entire page.
2540160	2543400	You know what other Squeenix collection I can't stand, and they've done more than one
2543400	2544400	games in the series.
2544400	2545920	I can't even remember the name of it.
2545920	2548920	It's the one where there's like eight different people, and they have the eight-
2548920	2549920	Saga Frontier.
2549920	2550920	The Saga series.
2550920	2552920	I freaking hate the Saga series.
2552920	2553920	Cannot stand it.
2553920	2559720	Sorry, RPG fans and Saga fans, but if you thought that, you know, because I do give
2559720	2563560	Final Fantasy a lot of love here on the show, Chrono series, things like that, but if you
2563560	2567720	thought the Squeenix could do no wrong, just go play the Saga series sometime.
2567720	2568720	It's pretty bad.
2568720	2569720	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2569720	2571840	Why didn't they ever carry on like the Tow Ball series?
2571840	2572840	I like that one.
2572840	2573840	Hmm.
2573840	2574840	What about Alundra?
2574840	2577840	Or Brave Fencer Musache was them, wasn't it?
2577840	2578840	Yeah, they did a new one.
2578840	2579840	Those were cute.
2579840	2580840	Yeah, did they?
2580840	2581840	It was a cute one.
2581840	2584320	I like PlayStation 2.
2584320	2592000	So this is also another article kind of correcting some more wrongs with Mario Kart Wii.
2592000	2596960	Apparently there was news before that Mario Kart Wii did not work with the freeloader.
2596960	2598960	However, that is false.
2598960	2604000	It actually does work just fine with the freeloader, so if you happen to live in the US and want
2604000	2610080	to pick up a copy of the European version and get it a few weeks before we get it here,
2610080	2614720	then go right ahead and pick one up because the freeloader will work just fine.
2614720	2624240	In fact, Import Retailer NCS tested the game on a version 3.1 firmware and it ran just
2624240	2630160	fine and apparently there was some issues, I guess, with 3.0 firmware.
2630160	2634600	So if you update your firmware, it should be good to go.
2634600	2636880	But I don't know.
2636880	2637880	Great game.
2637880	2638880	Wow.
2638880	2643880	Didn't take long for that to get opened up there.
2643880	2647960	But I guess, you know, especially with these staggered international dates, there really
2647960	2650400	are people who just can't freaking wait.
2650400	2651400	Like you.
2651400	2652400	Threw away the steering wheel.
2652400	2653400	Piece of shit.
2653400	2658600	Would it be cheaper, maybe, to import it so you can get the version without the steering
2658600	2659600	wheel?
2659600	2660600	I don't know.
2660600	2663240	I don't think they sell it without the steering wheel.
2663240	2669360	Well, apparently, on Mario Kart Wii, there are already people cheating in there.
2669360	2671400	And it's in the time trials mode, apparently.
2671400	2675840	There's all these impossible times that are showing up in the time trials mode.
2675840	2680680	Apparently, somebody on the official Nintendo Magazine forums wrote this on here.
2680680	2682760	I only saw it on the snowboard track.
2682760	2685920	There was a guy with a time of 53 point something or other seconds.
2685920	2689160	There are about three other people with exactly the same time.
2689160	2693360	Like others have said, on the replay, the guy just does one lap really slow and then
2693360	2696320	turns the opposite way just after the finish line.
2696320	2698460	Then the replay doesn't stop.
2698460	2700840	So he says, personally, I think it's a bug.
2700840	2702440	I've only seen it on one track.
2702440	2704280	And there are others with the same time.
2704280	2710320	What apparently was happening, and I'm not positive this is actually the case, but what
2710320	2718840	I heard was that if you let the time trial sit there for longer than 99 minutes and 99
2718840	2723560	seconds and 0.99, it'll actually loop back around to zero again.
2723560	2728440	So people were racing through a couple laps or whatever.
2728440	2736120	And then they would stop, wait for it to just barely flip over from, you know, who has time
2736120	2737120	to do that?
2737120	2740880	I mean, really, you're going to sit there and wait for 99 minutes or even, you know,
2740880	2742400	just leaving it on, doing that.
2742400	2747160	I don't know what the hell you're doing, you know, going up, going out drinking or something
2747160	2754760	and coming back 90 minutes later, just to have a high score that we all know is a piece
2754760	2755760	of crap.
2755760	2759720	Well, the thing about that, too, though, Nintendo has actually removed those scores off of their
2759720	2763000	leaderboards now.
2763000	2764000	So Nintendo is cracking down.
2764000	2767920	I'm just waiting for it to happen where people find a way to cheat in the multiplayer mode.
2767920	2768920	You know what I mean?
2768920	2769920	That's going to be a...
2769920	2771800	Oh my God.
2771800	2775960	I hope Nintendo knows a way to patch this game on the fly if things like that happen,
2775960	2777840	but we'll see.
2777840	2782240	I don't know, I don't think they have it built in yet where they can patch games.
2782240	2787120	In fact, I know they don't have it built in yet where they can patch games.
2787120	2789440	Does their firmware updates patch the games?
2789440	2793240	There's firmware updates, but I don't think they patch games.
2793240	2797400	But the good thing, though, is they don't have an action replay yet for the Wii.
2797400	2802680	They only have game saves and power saves and stuff like that.
2802680	2803680	I don't know.
2803680	2808800	There shouldn't really be a way to cheat unless you do something with the servers or whatever
2808800	2811360	where you lag someone out.
2811360	2815080	Plus it just goes back to if you're cheating online, why?
2815080	2816080	Why really?
2816080	2817080	What do you got to prove?
2817080	2818080	I don't know.
2818080	2819080	You know what I mean?
2819080	2824520	You beat three other strangers in an online Mario match when Nintendo doesn't even tell
2824520	2825520	you who you're playing against.
2825520	2827920	I mean, it's kind of like, big wow.
2827920	2828920	You know?
2828920	2830840	It's like, do you really have to feel that special?
2830840	2832000	I don't know.
2832000	2833440	Maybe it's just me.
2833440	2840040	Well, speaking of special people, you know that there's always that time top 100 most
2840040	2842760	influential people that they do.
2842760	2844920	And guess who's on the list this year?
2844920	2845920	Miyamoto.
2845920	2848600	He is on the list this year.
2848600	2856880	He has been voted for 25,000 times as of the source I'm reading.
2856880	2861440	So he's at number 31 out of 200.
2861440	2864320	And 56%.
2864320	2869480	And basically he's been put on there basically for making Mario and Zelda.
2869480	2875940	And for the new Wii stuff, you know, the things he's trying to do with the Wii.
2875940	2880400	And that, and he's been quoted saying that he wants to make people more aware of their
2880400	2886520	bodies and get in better shape and use that as a tool to improve their life and not just
2886520	2888160	slack around, you know?
2888160	2891360	So how much influence does the online poll have in the final result?
2891360	2894920	I mean, I seem to recall in the past, Time kind of did their own list of the 100 most
2894920	2899020	influential people, but then like the online poll kind of ran separately.
2899020	2903120	And you know, so you'd see like Howard Stern and Miyamoto and all these, you know, people
2903120	2906200	that have rabid fan bases, you know, towards the top of the list.
2906200	2911160	Well, see that I'm really not sure exactly how it works, but I can tell you other people
2911160	2912160	who are on it.
2912160	2913800	You've heard of Rain, haven't you?
2913800	2914800	I think so.
2914800	2915800	Korean.
2915800	2916800	Oh yeah.
2916800	2917800	Yeah.
2917800	2918800	He's actually right up at the top.
2918800	2919800	Interesting.
2919800	2921680	And right behind him is Steven Colbert.
2921680	2924720	See it's people with rabid fan bases like that.
2924720	2928600	Nothing against Steven Colbert because I think he's hilarious, but you know what I mean?
2928600	2931160	Well, he does have Captain America shield.
2931160	2936200	Hey, some comments from Justin TV, actually, who says, I ignore them all the time, but
2936200	2939080	a good comment here about the whole patching of Wii games.
2939080	2943120	Richie Maniac says they can't patch, otherwise they would have fixed Guitar Hero 3 without
2943120	2944880	sending out new discs.
2944880	2945880	Very good point.
2945880	2949120	So if somebody's cheating in Mario Kart, there's nothing they can do about it.
2949120	2952240	Well, I'm putting the unlink to vote for Miyamoto in the chat room.
2952240	2957680	But you could cheat however you want, however much you want in the...
2957680	2959920	And Black Wolf says, is correcting me and saying it's Colbert.
2959920	2961680	I thought that was just something he did on the show.
2961680	2962680	Is his last name really Colbert?
2962680	2964240	I thought that was just the show joke.
2964240	2965240	Colbert.
2965240	2966240	Because it's weird.
2966240	2969240	I know people with the exact same last name in real life, but they pronounce it with the
2969240	2971320	hard T. So my bad.
2971320	2973800	That's why it's the Colbert Report because, you know.
2973800	2974800	Oh.
2974800	2975800	Well, I just thought that was a joke.
2975800	2980160	I just got corrected again, so people don't correct me, okay?
2980160	2981160	This is pissing me off.
2981160	2982660	It's hot in here.
2982660	2983660	It is hot in here today.
2983660	2986040	What is up with the weather?
2986040	2992480	There's another game that got announced this week during Nintendo's Media Summit.
2992480	2994480	And this is not really a big surprise at all.
2994480	2999800	In fact, I want to say we've already seen this being announced at E3 last year, but
2999800	3001800	whatever.
3001800	3008240	Anyways, it is Super Mario, or I should say Mario Super Sluggers.
3008240	3017140	And it is, of course, a continuation of Super Mario Stadium Baseball.
3017140	3025160	Just another sports game from Nintendo that's capitalizing on Mario, just like Mario Strikers
3025160	3026160	and stuff.
3026160	3028480	You know, it's kind of funny.
3028480	3031320	I hope they don't do this, but I could just see them because they're kind of following
3031320	3036840	the trends of, or I should say bad trends, that third party companies are creating accessories
3036840	3037840	for.
3037840	3040000	They're creating attachments for the Wii Sports stuff.
3040000	3043800	I could just see them releasing this game with a baseball bat attachment or something
3043800	3044800	for the Wii.
3044800	3047560	Just like, I don't know, try to sell a few more copies.
3047560	3048560	Here's my question.
3048560	3051800	What really is the difference between the Super Sluggers thing and the Strikers?
3051800	3054040	I mean, aren't they just kind of both baseball games?
3054040	3057160	No, Strikers is a soccer game, whereas Sluggers is a baseball game.
3057160	3058160	Oh, what the hell am I thinking?
3058160	3059160	Why am I...
3059160	3060160	But there's another...
3060160	3061160	Wasn't there another...
3061160	3062160	Yeah, there's Mario Baseball.
3062160	3065400	Yeah, I'm like, I know there's another baseball game that already freaking came out on the
3065400	3066400	Wii.
3066400	3067400	Really?
3067400	3070680	I could have sworn there was already a baseball game on the Wii.
3070680	3075840	No, just like how there was, was it, oh god, I don't remember what the other...
3075840	3079200	There was another soccer game that was on GameCube as well.
3079200	3083840	So it's just import whatever, you know, sport with Mario in it.
3083840	3084840	Yeah.
3084840	3087680	Pretty soon it'll be Mario synchronized swimming.
3087680	3088680	Just in time for the Beijing Olympics.
3088680	3091840	I don't see how there could be any popular Japanese franchise that won't have a baseball
3091840	3092840	game attached to it.
3092840	3094280	I guess that's true.
3094280	3095880	Baseball is like the sport.
3095880	3096920	I guess that's true.
3096920	3102360	And guess what, Rob, you'll be happy to know that Toadette is in this game as well.
3102360	3103360	Bitch.
3103360	3108500	All right, rostielut in chat, dot orange launcher dot com, says, oh, baseball on the Wii.
3108500	3110200	This will appeal to the fanboys, really.
3110200	3111840	The casuals still have Wii Sports.
3111840	3115560	Well, I would think that baseball fanboys would go for something a little more hardcore.
3115560	3116560	MLB 2K8.
3116560	3118560	And I don't know if it would necessarily be on the Wii.
3118560	3122160	Or MLB Power Pros, you know, where it was just another baseball game.
3122160	3124760	Or they've already got like plenty of baseball games on them.
3124760	3127840	I would think these are the people that do like baseball on Wii Sports but want to take
3127840	3128840	it like one step further.
3128840	3129840	You know what I mean?
3129840	3130840	I don't know.
3130840	3132160	I don't know how appealing that is.
3132160	3134720	But Jamie does have a good point, especially over in Japan.
3134720	3135720	Baseball is huge.
3135720	3137480	And you know, baseball is huge here, too.
3137480	3140880	It may not be as big as football in this day and age, but.
3140880	3141880	That's fine.
3141880	3143960	This game will come out in the E3 or whatever.
3143960	3148280	I have a feeling, because I heard some rumors before, that this was going to be coming out
3148280	3149280	in June.
3149280	3155800	And then in July, there was supposed to be that stupid disaster day of crisis.
3155800	3158960	I don't remember what blog I read that in, but.
3158960	3162480	If this does come out and stuff, and then E3 rolls around and, oh, guess what?
3162480	3163480	Wii Sports 2.
3163480	3164680	And it's like, ah, shit.
3164680	3168120	I just bought this game and now, you know, Wii Sports 2.
3168120	3173200	Which is going to be probably the number one selling game all time on Wii.
3173200	3174200	Mario Hockey.
3174200	3175720	Several people want to see that game in our chat room.
3175720	3176960	A Mario Hockey game.
3176960	3180440	I don't know, though, because I think Nintendo might have a problem with people punching
3180440	3181440	Mario in the face.
3181440	3187460	Mario Hockey, all that would be is just like Super Mario Strikers with re-skinned, basically.
3187460	3188460	You know what they need?
3188460	3190840	They need to bring back old school ice hockey.
3190840	3192360	I actually had this game on the NES.
3192360	3195680	I'm not talking Blades of Steel, although that game was frickin rad, too, but I'm talking
3195680	3196880	old school ice hockey.
3196880	3198040	Remember this game?
3198040	3203120	Where you had your entire team consisted of the fat guys, the skinny guys, and the average
3203120	3204120	guys.
3204120	3205120	Remember that?
3205120	3206120	Yeah.
3206120	3207120	Mario Hockey 2008.
3207120	3208120	Or Ice Hockey Wii.
3208120	3211520	That'd be rad.
3211520	3212520	You know you want it.
3212520	3217160	All right, let's travel the world and explore upcoming release dates.
3217160	3219640	We're going to check out some games that are coming out a little bit sooner than some of
3219640	3221340	these other games we've been talking about.
3221340	3225140	We will start off in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.
3225140	3226200	Really not a lot.
3226200	3229800	You really have to wait for the 24th for any big games to start coming out.
3229800	3231380	Same thing with the PlayStation 3.
3231380	3233480	It's kind of a slow period right now.
3233480	3236320	On the Nintendo Wii, nothing either.
3236320	3240280	This is a dry week in Japan for these next batch of systems.
3240280	3245240	But if you want to go back to the PlayStation 2, Ape Escape 3 is coming out now in a Chinese
3245240	3246240	language.
3246240	3250240	So for the other Asian regions abroad, Ape Escape 3 comes out in Chinese this week.
3250240	3256080	Also a game called Hoshigari Empusa comes out in Japan on April the 17th.
3256080	3263760	And going over to the Nintendo DS, Gear Spirit from TV Animation One Piece, Gear Spirit.
3263760	3268960	Also from Nintendo, Pack and Ball comes out on the Nintendo DS.
3268960	3274480	And a new Phoenix Wright game, Gaikukten Saiban Mask Vision Murder Case.
3274480	3278240	Actually, I'm sorry, that's just a price reduction on Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney.
3278240	3281340	I was going to say, isn't that already out?
3281340	3282340	Just a price reduction.
3282340	3283340	Now it's out for much cheaper.
3283340	3286920	You can import that for about 20 bucks now, plus shipping.
3286920	3290240	So that's not bad.
3290240	3299720	Also on the Nintendo DS, Kansu Hajime Yo Shisan Unyo DS comes out.
3299720	3304280	And this is just, I don't know, the cover has a bunch of people like planting trees
3304280	3305320	on it.
3305320	3309160	And I don't know if that's supposed to symbolize like a tree of knowledge or what that is.
3309160	3314840	Because the category for the game is miscellaneous, which usually means some type of boring training
3314840	3315840	type thing.
3315840	3316840	I don't think it's a dating sim.
3316840	3317840	Joking.
3317840	3320000	Because you actually use the touch screen and stuff.
3320000	3321720	It's a perverted dating sim, though.
3321720	3322880	No, not that kind of dating.
3322880	3324760	It's not like, you know, I don't know.
3324760	3326760	I'm joking, Rob.
3326760	3330360	Let's see if there's anything coming out on the PSP.
3330360	3335280	Although I somehow doubt it, but we'll take a look real quick for the PSP in Japan.
3335280	3336280	No.
3336280	3338560	But the 24th will be a big week.
3338560	3341320	There's lots more stuff coming out for you folks in Japan on the 24th.
3341320	3346840	But this week, you're gonna have to just play the games you already have, I guess.
3346840	3347840	That's it.
3347840	3355320	For the games that are coming out for our friends over in the UK, we have, on the 16th,
3355320	3359560	Trackmania Nations Forever on PC.
3359560	3360560	Trackmania.
3360560	3363960	Those look pretty awesome.
3363960	3364960	Is it?
3364960	3365960	Yeah.
3365960	3366960	Okay.
3366960	3369840	I want that Konami track game where you can play as Pyramid Head.
3369840	3370840	That's the one I'm waiting for.
3370840	3371840	I know, right?
3371840	3372840	The new track and field?
3372840	3373840	Yeah.
3373840	3374840	Do want.
3374840	3375840	July.
3375840	3376840	The hell with all the other track games.
3376840	3377840	July or August.
3377840	3378840	Alright, thank you.
3378840	3383960	Anyway, also coming out, now this is on the 18th of this next series of games, which is
3383960	3388960	the day before my birthday, Emergency Mayhem on Wii.
3388960	3390960	Hard to be a god on PC.
3390960	3394240	I think I'm gonna need to get that game, okay?
3394240	3395480	Story of my life.
3395480	3399040	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC.
3399040	3407360	UEFA Euro 2008 on PC, Xbox 360, and Playstation 3, and PS2, and PSP, and Wonderswan Color,
3407360	3411240	and Neo Geo Pocket Color, and the Neo Geo CD.
3411240	3413480	Those last four are probably not true.
3413480	3416680	8 Ball All Stars on DS.
3416680	3419640	We have Namco Museum Remix on Wii.
3419640	3421320	I need to get that.
3421320	3424280	The World Ends With You on DS.
3424280	3426000	That's a lot of pressure, isn't it?
3426000	3428120	That sounds like something you'd say before you kill someone.
3428120	3429120	The World Ends With You.
3429120	3431080	No, that sounds like a Bond movie.
3431080	3432080	Ooh, it does.
3432080	3434520	It does sound like a Bond movie.
3434520	3438560	And the very last is Time Crisis 4 on Playstation 3.
3438560	3439560	Awesome.
3439560	3442720	Yeah, Time Crisis.
3442720	3448760	In the US, it's an okay release week, I should say.
3448760	3457480	Starting off, we've got Major League Baseball 2K8 Fantasy All Stars for the DS.
3457480	3461400	It's kind of an arcade-style version of that game.
3461400	3464880	Sherlock Holmes Nemesis on the PC.
3464880	3469280	AMF Bullying Pin Busters on the DS.
3469280	3471760	Rondo of Swords on the DS.
3471760	3473880	Good Atlus RPG.
3473880	3476560	Okami on the Wii.
3476560	3479640	Jack Keane on the PC.
3479640	3483760	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue on the PS3.
3483760	3486560	That's just a small little game there.
3486560	3489960	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC.
3489960	3495600	Also on PC this week, Turok and Europa Universal...
3495600	3498880	Was it Universalist Rome?
3498880	3501400	That's kind of a weird name.
3501400	3504480	High School Musical 2 worked this out on the DS.
3504480	3506120	Also another Disney DS game.
3506120	3508360	What if I don't want to work it out?
3508360	3509360	Then you don't buy the game.
3509360	3510680	Alright, I won't.
3510680	3515040	Another Disney DS game, Cory in the House.
3515040	3520640	The Sims 2 Kitchen and Bath Interior Design Stuff expansion for the PC.
3520640	3522680	Oh, yay!
3522680	3529240	Summer Sports Paradise Island for the Wii, also being brought out by Destineer, which
3529240	3531520	has crappy games.
3531520	3536600	Teenage Zombies Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies for the DS.
3536600	3541520	Emergency Mayhem for the Wii, which is supposed to be just like Crazy Taxi.
3541520	3549560	And as Rob mentioned earlier, the Final Fantasy XI Vanity of Collection 2008 for the PC.
3549560	3550920	We have other releases.
3550920	3553040	Do you want to get into that kind of crack?
3553040	3554040	Alright, yeah.
3554040	3555880	What about the Virtual Console?
3555880	3558240	Well these of course have already come out now.
3558240	3560800	These are for our UK releases for Virtual Console.
3560800	3568920	It's Yoshi's Cookie, which is 500 Wii points, the equivalent of 5 euro or 3 pounds 50.
3568920	3571120	And it's Yoshi's Cookie.
3571120	3572920	What more do I need to say about freaking Yoshi's Cookie?
3572920	3576960	That it was far superior on the Super Nintendo, so why they released the Nintendo version
3576960	3577960	I have no idea.
3577960	3580040	Now the next one.
3580040	3583080	We need triumphant music for this, for these next two.
3583080	3584080	Hold on, hold on.
3584080	3586640	I do have fanfare music somewhere.
3586640	3587640	It'll just take me a minute.
3587640	3589440	Can you read a different one before you get to those two?
3589440	3592320	Well the next two are, these are the only two left.
3592320	3593880	Actually, are they?
3593880	3595080	No, there's more.
3595080	3597160	I will skip ahead and then I will go back to the awesome ones.
3597160	3600000	Alright good, because I'm getting the fanfare right now.
3600000	3603160	California Games, which is Commodore 64.
3603160	3606640	Ooh, Commodore 64 games are hitting the Wii finally.
3606640	3608640	And Impossible Mission.
3608640	3610480	Both of them.
3610480	3612280	That's the one I should have played the fanfare for.
3612280	3619320	Both of them are 500 Wii points, 3 pounds 50 pence or 5 euro.
3619320	3623720	And um, but those aren't the two that- Stay awhile.
3623720	3624720	The realm of awesome for me.
3624720	3625720	Stay forever.
3625720	3629800	Did you ever play Impossible Mission?
3629800	3631720	I didn't have a Commodore 64, Rob.
3631720	3632720	Really?
3632720	3633720	I told you I didn't.
3633720	3634720	That's right.
3634720	3638080	You know what I had is I had the Texas Instruments stupid retardo computer.
3638080	3640920	And I had a Coleco Adam.
3640920	3642920	I'm still trying to find the sounds.
3642920	3643920	Darn it.
3643920	3646360	Well then I will go ahead, because I will go ahead and announce the one that somebody
3646360	3647360	gets fanfare.
3647360	3648360	Oh you know why?
3648360	3652560	Because here's the thing, I had to upgrade Winamp to get Shoutcast now.
3652560	3655760	And for whatever reason my Winamp is not playing WAV files.
3655760	3657080	Although you think it would.
3657080	3658320	The old one did.
3658320	3662280	I just haven't configured it right, so we have no sounds tonight.
3662280	3663600	We'll have Loki sing a fanfare.
3663600	3665680	Wait hold on, Loki sing the fanfare.
3665680	3667560	I'm not singing the fanfare.
3667560	3668560	No fanfare.
3668560	3669560	Please.
3669560	3670560	Use the NBC music.
3670560	3671560	No.
3671560	3672560	You can't use it can you?
3672560	3673560	Just read it.
3673560	3675120	We're wasting so much time.
3675120	3676120	Precious time.
3676120	3680560	Alright, Wonder Boy from the Sega Master System, 500 Wii points.
3680560	3685520	And that game is really sweet, but this is the one that makes me super uber happy.
3685520	3686520	Fantasy Zone!
3686520	3688680	Didn't we announce this last week?
3688680	3689680	Yay.
3689680	3690680	No.
3690680	3695120	I think we announced it was coming, but it wasn't really known when it was coming.
3695120	3696120	It's out now.
3696120	3699860	You're the Oppa Oppa and you get to shoot stuff and it sort of plays like Defender,
3699860	3701640	but it's awesome.
3701640	3706480	Fantasy Zone is my second favorite game ever.
3706480	3708480	And was one of the classic games of the week as well.
3708480	3710680	It was the first classic game of the week.
3710680	3711680	Alright.
3711680	3712680	Nice.
3712680	3716160	By the way, in the US on the Virtual Console, you also get Yoshi's Cookie and Bases Loaded
3716160	3718240	came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
3718240	3721080	Speaking of baseball games, if you want to play one of the classics, Bases Loaded sets
3721080	3725160	you back 500 Wii points.
3725160	3728640	Now we'll go back to some gaming news.
3728640	3734160	And I don't know, this isn't exactly like totally gaming news, this is basically what
3734160	3735160	idiots think.
3735160	3738060	I don't know, maybe this should be a new segment on our show.
3738060	3739060	What idiots think.
3739060	3740060	I don't know.
3740060	3741700	Here's the deal.
3741700	3745460	There's this website and it's called WhatTheyPlay.com.
3745460	3752080	And it's a parental oriented website and they did a poll a little earlier this week.
3752080	3757860	And what they did in this poll is that they surveyed what would you find most offensive
3757860	3759880	in a video game.
3759880	3761560	And here's the results.
3761560	3767900	The choices were a graphically severed human head, a man and a woman having sex, multiple
3767900	3772200	use of the F word, and two men kissing.
3772200	3773200	Here's the thing.
3773200	3779280	The least offensive according to the poll is multiple usages of the F word, 10%.
3779280	3789520	The second least offensive, a graphically severed human head with 28%, no 26%.
3789520	3795300	And then two men kissing, 27%.
3795300	3801320	So two men kissing is right in the same ballpark as a graphically severed human head in how
3801320	3805040	offensive they are in a video game.
3805040	3806520	I mean like words escape me.
3806520	3810160	I think most people in this generation that probably listen to this program are probably
3810160	3812240	rolling their eyes and going, what the fuck at this as well?
3812240	3815920	This is just a couple of like old farts that need to like get out of the barn and go outdoors
3815920	3816920	once in a while.
3816920	3817920	They're answering this poll.
3817920	3820000	And then they have a, was it the man and woman having sex?
3820000	3824120	Yeah, man and a woman having sex is at 37%, but honestly has no surprise to me.
3824120	3826440	I mean, hello, look at American society.
3826440	3830960	People are way more pent up over sexual things than they are violence.
3830960	3833280	It's been that way forever.
3833280	3841480	I have to say that we are probably one of the most, I'd have to say conflicting societies
3841480	3847600	as far as, because you know, sex sells everything and everything, you know, they're, you know,
3847600	3848960	the porn industry is thriving.
3848960	3852560	There's all this yet we have this other extreme like, Oh, but we don't talk about that.
3852560	3853720	Oh, we don't do this.
3853720	3854960	Oh, we don't have this in our game.
3854960	3857120	Oh, this is offensive.
3857120	3860080	People just need to get over it.
3860080	3864760	Sairan says in our chat room, well, what, so Sharon, I keep mispronouncing it says,
3864760	3866040	what did the two men look like?
3866040	3869560	I guess that is important because if they're like two guys who haven't bathed in a week,
3869560	3870600	that would be kind of offensive.
3870600	3871600	I think.
3871600	3872960	I don't think the kissing would be offensive.
3872960	3875840	I would just think that the lack of personal hygiene would be offensive.
3875840	3876840	That's the point.
3876840	3882480	So, so where does like, say, I don't know, a two men kissing graphically severed human
3882480	3887760	head, uh, on top of a man and woman having sex while they shout, you know, obscenities.
3887760	3889120	Where's that fall on the list?
3889120	3890520	Is this your next dream game?
3890520	3895360	Is there, is there like, I think there, I think there is an OLR dream game to be had
3895360	3896360	here.
3896360	3900520	Is there a write in, uh, uh, write in a vote?
3900520	3901520	There should be write in vote.
3901520	3902520	All right.
3902520	3903520	Yeah.
3903520	3905680	My write in vote would be this poll.
3905680	3906680	Here it is.
3906680	3907680	Okay.
3907680	3909840	We're going to call it a what they play.com the game.
3909840	3910840	Okay.
3910840	3912560	It's what they play.com the game.
3912560	3918280	And what it is is it, uh, it stars, uh, it stars three people, two guys and a girl.
3918280	3920600	And uh, all they do is they know how to say the F word.
3920600	3922400	So we get the 10% there.
3922400	3927460	And uh, meanwhile the two guys will kiss and then the man and the woman will have sex while
3927460	3929160	they sever the other guy's head.
3929160	3933160	I'm not sure.
3933160	3939000	I'm not sure where the game is in this, but we'll find it somewhere to take pictures.
3939000	3940000	Yeah.
3940000	3941000	Yeah.
3941000	3942000	Like Pokemon.
3942000	3943000	Okay.
3943000	3944200	There it is.
3944200	3954160	So what the more offensive the photo is, the more D the photo is then that's beautiful.
3954160	3955160	I love this idea.
3955160	3956160	Sick imagination.
3956160	3957160	It's what they play.
3957160	3958160	Snap.
3958160	3959160	Okay.
3959160	3960160	I want to change the name.
3960160	3961160	The game.
3961160	3962160	Okay.
3962160	3963160	So an OLR dream game.
3963160	3964160	Here it is.
3964160	3965160	What they play.
3965160	3966160	Snap.
3966160	3967160	So it is to our Wiki.
3967160	3968160	Yes.
3968160	3969160	We need a dream games Wiki.
3969160	3970160	There is the dream games.
3970160	3971160	Yes.
3971160	3974160	There's already a Wiki page on there, so we'll need to get this added.
3974160	3980040	Uh, what they play snap and in what they play snap is three people that use the F word,
3980040	3984640	then half kiss each other, then have sex with each other, then kill each other while you
3984640	3989640	take pictures on a track.
3989640	3999000	And then in later stages, in later stages, you get the pester ball because no one likes
3999000	4003480	the pester ball.
4003480	4005040	We seriously have problems.
4005040	4006040	Rob is red in the face.
4006040	4007440	I don't think it's from the heat.
4007440	4012400	I think it's just so excited about the idea because I find this immature shit funny.
4012400	4013400	Okay.
4013400	4014600	Let's go back.
4014600	4016400	Let's go back to the root problem though.
4016400	4017400	Here is this survey.
4017400	4020960	Obviously we're being a little bit facetious with this whole stuff here.
4020960	4023720	The problem is I want the game.
4023720	4025480	I think quick poll.
4025480	4028080	We need to do an insta poll right now in a orange lounge.
4028080	4029080	Okay.
4029080	4030080	Chat that orange laundry.com.
4030080	4032060	I want to see some wiser ends.
4032060	4036200	Would you buy what they play snap wire and would you play it?
4036200	4038520	Let's say the game costs $29.99.
4038520	4040040	Would you put, would you buy it?
4040040	4043680	And it's on Nintendo Wii.
4043680	4044680	Would you buy it?
4044680	4045680	Wire end.
4045680	4050560	I think that that's what makes that the most, just completely farcical.
4050560	4051560	Act now.
4051560	4058840	We'll throw in a, um, a severed head controller, like cover attachment, severed head attachment.
4058840	4062280	It'd be a camera, severed head camera.
4062280	4065360	Somebody in chat said something about this and I thought it was really good.
4065360	4069280	Um, I think it was Ross Steele, UT had said something and I lost it here.
4069280	4070280	Oh, here it is.
4070280	4073200	Uh, seriously, this isn't exactly a scientific poll.
4073200	4077680	You'd get different results on game facts and it does have to do with the audience that
4077680	4081980	was, uh, sampled is cause it was, you know, more of a conservative audience.
4081980	4086000	But still, I mean, doesn't that kind of say something about just society in general?
4086000	4088280	I mean, maybe this goes beyond gaming a little bit.
4088280	4093160	Pardon us for getting so deep, but seriously guys, seriously, two guys kissing is more
4093160	4094680	offensive than a severed head.
4094680	4098560	Like, I hate to break it to you, but like, you know, I don't think it's, I'm biased just
4098560	4104400	because I happen to be gay and you know, well, hell, the guy I'm seeing and have been seeing
4104400	4106680	for over a year now is a conservative.
4106680	4108760	He's very active in Republican, he's a log cabin guy.
4108760	4111080	He's very active in Republican politics.
4111080	4114400	You know, whether you are conservative or liberal, doesn't really have anything to do
4114400	4115400	it.
4115400	4120480	I don't know whether you're an idiot or not in terms of this poll, but I don't know.
4120480	4124920	Like I, me personally, I cannot watch the Saw movies like that level of violence.
4124920	4126840	Like I watched the first one and I was like, that's enough.
4126840	4128240	I've heard about what's in the other ones.
4128240	4129720	I don't need to see it.
4129720	4131760	If you want to watch it, have fun.
4131760	4134040	You want to see that sick shit, go for it.
4134040	4136320	But for me, like I don't want to watch that.
4136320	4138120	There's other things I could watch with my time.
4138120	4139120	Like showgirls.
4139120	4144520	Showgirls is great and for the record, I've never seen a Saw movie and never will.
4144520	4146040	Cause it's just, you know, I don't know.
4146040	4148240	I think that is a generational thing.
4148240	4151480	Am I going to change my opinion as I get older or what is it?
4151480	4152480	No, no.
4152480	4162320	I think that the violent graphic violence for the sake of graphic violence is unnecessary.
4162320	4164320	You know, I believe in all things in moderation.
4164320	4168240	Like if I have a movie that's just a good movie that happens to have some graphic violence
4168240	4169960	in it, then that's okay.
4169960	4175240	I don't care if there's a little blood and gore thrown out if it's part, you know, if
4175240	4179400	it moves the story along, but when the whole movie is nothing but that, then I think that
4179400	4180960	it's just crap.
4180960	4182880	Here are the results of our quick poll.
4182880	4185400	Would you buy our game on the Nintendo Wii?
4185400	4186400	Why?
4186400	4187400	Why?
4187400	4188400	Why?
4188400	4191400	N. Throw the pester ball at the people having sex and they look up at you and say, fuck.
4191400	4192400	Why?
4192400	4193400	Why?
4193400	4194400	Why?
4194400	4195400	Why?
4195400	4196400	Why?
4196400	4197400	Why?
4197400	4198400	Why?
4198400	4199400	Why?
4199400	4200400	Why?
4200400	4201400	Why?
4201400	4202400	Why?
4202400	4203400	Why?
4203400	4204740	Why?
4204740	4205940	Why?
4205940	4207640	Why?
4207640	4209080	Why in a fucking instant?
4209080	4210080	And why?
4210080	4211040	There you have it.
4211040	4214720	The results of the OLR quick poll.
4214720	4216320	Interesting comment as well from odd1.
4216320	4219140	Torture porn is just what the name says.
4219140	4221720	I'll leave it but nothing against those who watch it.
4221720	4222720	Why?
4222720	4225400	Because I don't bloody think that one piece of media is going to completely change a person
4225400	4227920	and destroy it whatever moral fiber they might have.
4227920	4229160	And Jirnami says, case in point-
4229160	4233380	Each of the killer, you know, there's a lot of sick shit out there in movies
4233380	4239440	If you want to watch it go for it, but you know on the other hand if people want to watch
4240380	4243940	If people want to play a game that might involve a sexual component
4244880	4250920	Whatever right? That's what warnings are for. Hi exactly. It's what reviews are for. Hi read them, you know
4251360	4256620	Be educated be a little educated when it comes to purchasing your games be you know
4256620	4260940	What there's people should just be educated in general and not so freakin head up their ass
4262600	4265840	That's what I think all right your head out of your ass I
4266800	4269180	Don't really know what else to say in response to this story
4269180	4274760	I mean, you know, you think I'd have a big rant or something to say with this, but sadly the results
4274760	4277620	Don't kind of surprise me. It's just the way our society is I think
4278320	4283820	Think some of the people need to need to re-examine their priorities. I think this poll shows
4283820	4288060	I think that's the best way I can some of it this poll shows that there are people out there
4288360	4295720	With their certain agendas that really really need to re-examine their priorities. That's it back to games
4296400	4298400	Okay Legos
4299120	4301600	Okay, Legos aren't really games, but they do make Lego games
4302320	4305840	And you know that I think that the Lego Star Wars games are tons of fun
4305840	4313760	so now there is going to be by Activision a Lego, Indiana Jones game that's going to be out on the 6th of June and
4314440	4316040	you have
4316040	4319600	you can actually play as over 60 characters and
4321120	4325200	Some of his friends and some of the enemies and you can actually
4326160	4328800	Customize your characters by mixing out their parts
4329520	4331520	you know like when you play with Legos and
4331520	4338240	And you have your whip and it's from what I'm seeing that that the whole using the whip is sort of like
4340840	4342120	Pitfall
4342120	4346680	because you're saying that you use it to get over gaps and hit switches and
4347560	4352040	You can use you can use it to pick up items in the game to throw at people
4353200	4359480	And then you can interact you know with your environment, and you swim and climb and you know
4359480	4366000	Jumping climbing trees that type of stuff. Well, Indiana Jones is kind of fun anyway. Yeah, I think it'd be pretty fun
4366000	4368360	And I go series is cute. Go games are so fun
4368360	4372120	I mean that's they may not be the most stellar looking games
4372120	4375680	They may be kind of dumb, but the Lego games are just fun
4376240	4379760	You know just like a movie full of sex and violence dumb fun
4380560	4384260	No, that's showgirls. Oh, sorry, which is both a movie full anyway
4384260	4392860	It's also coming out in the US and released North America in June as well, so around the same time as the movie
4393780	4395420	awesome
4395420	4400900	There's gonna be an update coming. Well. We've been talking about for a while now codename Bogart. Which is coming to
4401540	4408020	Burnout paradise it's going to be basically the next update that they have hopefully adding this
4408020	4415460	Brand new island to race in and going to be part of you know many different updates that they're going to have for the game
4416300	4421060	Some of the things that are going to be coming with it including some bug fixes
4421580	4424680	That they're going to be identifying the top 10
4426180	4428180	problems that users have been facing
4428700	4430620	online functionality
4430620	4432100	balancing tweaks
4432100	4438020	They're gonna be fixing like the head-on takedowns which seemed unfair. I guess an unrealistic
4438620	4442180	unfair low-speed takedowns have been removed and
4442900	4446100	Then they're gonna also be of course adding you know
4447020	4449460	the brand new tracks and or
4450140	4455340	Portions of the game and hopefully some new cars to download all this is supposed to happen April
4455900	4460300	24th so I guess a lot to happen in a day. Yeah, and so I guess we'll have to
4460300	4463060	Stay tuned to see what that is. I'm interested in it
4463060	4467860	I'm actually gonna start playing the game again once it comes out, but only briefly because you know
4468420	4472420	Paradise kind of wore out quick. I don't think I like the open-world thing
4472420	4476180	I think I'd like my burnout the way it was I don't like what they did to it. I like the open-world
4476180	4480460	It's just I don't know yeah, I know I'm being so hypocritical because I loved it in test drive
4480460	4483020	Maybe that's why I'm kind of like it's just when I played burnout
4483020	4487160	I played this before a lot of grinding is what it is because a lot of like okay
4487160	4492840	You finish this many races now you have to do it all over again to get this next license
4492840	4494040	And I got to do it all over again
4494040	4498220	Where it's like the crash modes and stuff like that of the you know older games
4498440	4505880	They you know provided different scenarios and stuff to play through whereas this game. You can kind of crash anywhere, but there's only really
4506420	4511920	Specific spots that you're going to kind of want to go to where you can get enough points to you know get to the next
4512800	4516760	License well burnout paradise is not the only game that's getting a patch this week
4516760	4522840	Layer is also going to be getting a patch very soon. It's coming out in Japan on April 17th
4522840	4527620	That's probably the same day. You're likely to see it everywhere else the biggest thing that you're getting in this patch
4528140	4535600	Not just rumble support for the new rumble controllers coming out the dual shock threes, but now you're going to get analog controls
4536860	4540520	Finally you don't have to just control with the six axis controller
4540520	4547660	You can also there will be a new targeting icon that shows up and now you can download wind dragon and poison dragon
4547840	4550320	The different types dragons that you can use in any old stage
4550320	4554160	I wonder if this will change people's opinions on the game because some of the people you know biggest bitch
4554160	4559500	They had was the controls yeah, if they fix the controls. I'd be really interested to see how the game plays out
4559500	4565320	I want to see some people just some not everybody but some people that reviewed this game before like re-review it if that makes sense
4565320	4572320	They may actually I'd be curious to see that which is very interesting if a patch has that big of an impact on a game
4572320	4576720	You know what? I mean? Well, I'll teach them to stick with the stupid motion controls
4577240	4581660	Hmm only you know they should have it as an option. Hmm. Just like rumble
4582760	4584760	true
4584840	4589880	Well some good news for our friends over in the UK is that
4589880	4596400	one of the retailers shop to is confirmed that they are going to be selling a Grand Theft Auto for
4596960	4599080	hardware bundle that will have
4599800	4608080	The 40 gig ps3 6-axis and a copy of GTA 4 and it will be out on the 29th of April for 299 pounds
4608880	4611800	Which is for the equivalent of a 590 bucks for us?
4611800	4620960	Nice any word on something like that coming over here. Not that I've seen hmm
4622720	4624640	Are you surprised Loki at the lack?
4624640	4628960	I mean, I know you're big on Grand Theft Auto 4 and this is supposed to be like a system selling type game
4628960	4633960	I have actually heard people thinking of investing in a PlayStation 3 because they want to get Grand Theft Auto and
4634040	4638440	For whatever reason there's more games on the ps3 than interest them as opposed to Xbox 360
4638440	4645160	Why isn't Sony jumping on the opportunity over here? I don't know probably because they have a new bundle coming out with
4645880	4650520	Metal Gear Solid 4 I mean if they were going to do a bundle they would have already announced it by now I
4651200	4653920	Don't know. Maybe they're just not selling as well over
4654920	4661400	Say you know in Europe and stuff. Maybe they're really needing to push them. That's why they have all those extra bundles over there
4661400	4668920	Really though and they've been having trouble keeping the bundles or actually these systems in I think
4669480	4671200	Although we haven't been selling them too fast
4671200	4678280	I know so and I mean I went to Fry's the other day, and they had pallets of just ps3s just sitting there, so
4679440	4682060	It's not like there was a shortage of them. It's just people
4682760	4684760	need games to play on it and
4684760	4691960	I guess Grand Theft Auto will be one of those games. It'll be one they'll sell systems, but at the same time. I think you know
4692800	4695040	Just if people actually realize hey
4696000	4699180	there's a lot of games on 360 as well, and it's coming out on there, but
4699880	4702680	To each his own I guess whatever their preference is
4704120	4711540	So one thing though that's kind of disappointing is the PlayStation Network will be going down tomorrow for about 15 hours
4711540	4715580	But not a big deal like because it will be coming back
4716300	4722420	Shortly after that with the brand new PlayStation store. It's going to be completely redesigned
4722660	4725400	I'm going to have a bunch of new features in there as well
4726220	4731860	supposed to be a little bit easier to browse kind of like the I don't know sink star store a little bit and
4732980	4736100	Some of the cool things that they're going to have on there as well
4737420	4738780	hopefully
4738780	4740460	the home
4740460	4742820	beta will be coming out pretty soon, but
4744300	4747940	You know lots of stuff to look forward to and it's nice to see that
4747940	4753060	They're actually updating their store because it was pretty hard the browse through and this looks a little bit better
4754820	4760340	Yeah, it's a I think the PlayStation store kind of needed some look and feel changes to it
4760340	4761660	So I hope this goes well for them
4761660	4769280	You know what other store needs to look and changes that fucking virtual console store needs some serious updates
4769280	4771280	well
4771600	4777080	Going from hardcore updates and news to big old rumors. This is take this with a big grain of salt
4778280	4780920	Apparently this is coming over from game reactor
4782000	4788280	Some blogger on there has said that apparently John Woo is going to announce the Metroid film at
4788640	4791080	Next week's comic-con in New York City
4791720	4794280	Here's the deal with it. It's going to star
4794800	4797840	Christiana Loken and she was the main actress in blood rain
4797840	4799360	apparently
4799360	4802840	But thank God is not being directed by a bowl like blood rain was and God
4803360	4807680	And apparently there's a little picture that made its way through it that says
4808960	4811760	5209 like a release date May 2nd of 2009
4812320	4817200	So now here's the thing is that you might go bullshit, but there are some pieces of it that add up
4817680	4821320	John Woo purchase the rights to Metroid although that was a couple years ago
4821800	4827540	But he did and he's gotten involved with video games before because there was stranglehold right was a John Woo game as well
4827540	4829160	so
4829160	4834260	Kind of interesting I think the release date makes this fault because I think if this were true
4834320	4841680	The movie would already be filming and I don't know that seems like a pretty aggressive release date to just like unless they're gonna like start
4841680	4845200	Filming it this summer. I guess they could really see it can change. I mean, it's just
4846520	4851840	Good. Well, I think also keep in mind that a lot of times especially for seek for projects that they're gonna
4851840	4857680	Hype quite a bit and when I actually push out there that they'll start filming them under a false name, but
4858120	4865600	Still I just with the amount of buzz that a game like this would get I would think that something would leak
4865600	4867320	You know what? I mean, I
4867320	4868920	Don't know. I
4868920	4871240	Don't know if they're doing it all on a soundstage
4871240	4877180	You know also all the work that they could be doing right now could be up now maybe going in reverse a little bit doing
4877180	4883200	A lot of the CG work now and then going back and then filming this stuff and then adding the CG stuff in there
4883200	4885200	I don't know
4885280	4886480	There's modeling
4886480	4891840	Yeah, I would just think the special effects that a Metroid movie would take are gonna take too long unless they've already been doing them
4891840	4896640	But again if they've already been doing them some dude on a blog somewhere would not have been the first one to notice this
4897240	4899240	It's gonna really suck
4900000	4902760	That would be sad. That would be very sad
4902760	4907620	Because after all the we both films, you know, they don't take that long to put together. So
4908680	4910600	bite your tongue
4910600	4916560	Metroid set in like a Western or something like that. All right. Well, we're about to the end of the first half of our program
4916560	4920580	That's right. You guys listening at all games calm for the first time possibly to our show. We're a long show
4920580	4921640	We're about a three hour show
4921640	4923900	We're about to the end of the first half of our program
4923900	4929060	But we don't end part a until we have a chance to go back and look at the classics
4929060	4931680	And I guess I already did that a little bit during my gaming week
4931680	4936400	I talked about one classic game that wasn't the official game of the week dark Sakura likes to you know
4936400	4938760	She's got the massive collection. She was talking about earlier
4938760	4944640	She likes to dig through her collection every week and find one game to spotlight for those you guys
4945080	4948860	Pay a little respect to the classic video game of the week
4951360	4955080	So dark Sakura what classic video game have you selected for the crowd this week?
4955080	4958840	This is another one that makes my heart hurt that it's considered a classic now
4958840	4965360	Um, but it came out on PlayStation and it's bus to move. I'm not talking about puzzle bobble
4966040	4969720	it came out over here as this is bust a groove because
4970520	4974560	Puzzle puzzle bobble came out as best to move already and therefore had the license in the u.s.
4974560	4993560	Um, but in Japan, it was best to move. Let's take a listen
4993560	4999360	Whoever's playing this kitty and is actually doing pretty good and the video file that we are playing this from is actually the person playing
4999360	5003760	On the mode with no commands. I don't know if you noticed that Rob. Yeah, I know that
5003760	5007600	I was like something's wrong with this when I was looking at it. There's no arrows that you hit in
5007600	5011760	Yeah, that's actually when I was at my height of playing this game. I used to play it without hands
5012800	5017880	Everyone has the same damn moves. You're probably gonna have to explain for our listeners how this is different from DDR
5018320	5021460	okay, and basically what bus to move is it's sort of a
5022300	5025140	versus dance game where you
5025600	5030880	put in the commands that it brings up on the screen and you do them you hit your
5030880	5036840	Trigger, but I guess I usually call it the trigger. Whatever your last command button is to activate those moves
5037480	5043360	Right on the beat. So you have to have good rhythm to make sure that you're you're hitting this, right? And
5044240	5050560	Some of the songs go from super easy to super hard to just being easy and then having tricky parts
5051120	5057040	Like this one in fact at the very end of this part is where the trickiest part of the song for me is
5057040	5060640	But and as you might have just heard where it says high scoring moves
5060640	5063920	You actually have secret moves that when it comes up to the character's
5064480	5070440	Solo part if you know what that command is then you can put in those moves and it boosts your score even more
5072280	5076160	It has a bunch of different characters had different songs each you had
5077200	5081720	Different styles they actually changed quite a bit though when the US version came out you had Frida
5081720	5087440	Gaso ham who was the hamburger guy I thought he was great heat hero
5088000	5092960	Who was the disco guy Kelly who was a fetishist? She was a slut basically
5093760	5095760	He had kitty and kitty Nakajima
5096640	5101280	Who was sort of like I guess like the she was in some Senshi, you know TV show
5102000	5107880	Pinky who's a stripper and she's actually pretty cool shorty. Who's the little girl?
5107880	5114760	And you had strike who's the sort of gangster sort of and then you had hidden characters like you had burger dog who used hands
5115760	5122320	Dance moves who's in hand stage capoeira which were two silver aliens that did capoeira style dancing
5122800	5129000	Columbo that was shorty's pet mouse and robo zee who was actually the the boss of the game and
5129400	5134840	When you fight robo zee robo zee's like a really freakin tall and you're like, oh my god
5134840	5139720	she's like a really freakin tall and you're like maybe the size of a finger and
5141040	5147920	You're actually on top of the building and it's in the middle of the street causing accidents and wrecks. Hey, it's it's um, capoeira
5148560	5149880	but
5149880	5151880	Capoeira was also
5152160	5157560	Called Kiki and Lala which I thought was pretty funny. So when the game came out in the US they
5157560	5172200	See, this is the good version if you can turn up a little bit. Okay, this is they played this song in English and it sucked. The woman could not sing for crap.
5173080	5178960	They actually did they edit it quite a bit like when strike comes out you drink from a flask and
5178960	5186880	And um, they change it to a can of coke they took out hero's cigarette they changed certain lyrics for being I guess
5187560	5191160	Racially charged and also removed references to McDonald's and Burger King
5193520	5197920	They like I said, they did some of the songs in English which just was awful
5197920	5200760	Oh my god, they left fritas in Japanese, which I don't understand
5202160	5204160	and then
5204160	5208880	And also with the stages though is that if you did a
5209720	5216320	7-point combo which you know that was getting up to the most difficult stage of doing those special combos
5217000	5223520	You could get the levels to do like neat stuff like for this stage here capoeira stage the doors would pop off and you'd either
5223520	5225960	Be in the air you'd be in outer space depending
5227560	5231720	If you play shorty and pull one off her mouse jumps out of her pocket starts dancing with her
5231720	5236560	Um, this game is so it's just really one of my okay
5236560	5238560	I first played this when someone brought over
5238880	5245760	Their copy that it only been at like a week in Japan and I imported it like as soon as payday hit
5245760	5252660	Um, I know this bugs you when I call it this but bust a move too was my first rhythm game ever here in the u.s
5252660	5257860	And that that you know without that game. I probably would not be here on orange lawns radio today. So I
5258600	5260520	Totally love this series as well
5260520	5267200	best to move to and I've and the reason why I'm not really combining them is because actually best to move to
5268080	5270440	To me is sort of a different game
5271560	5272680	because
5272680	5276580	Each character had their own set of special commands instead of having
5278480	5282120	Everyone having the same move, which is why you can play best to move in
5284600	5290480	Without the commands because everybody had the same damn commands and I actually had one of the first English fan sites on this game
5290480	5296000	And it's gone. It's been dead. But the link is still on the anime web turnpike if that's any any
5297600	5302960	Indication of how long I've had that site fever time. Yeah character does really well
5302960	5306500	They get to bust out of solo. It's pretty awesome. And the endings are funny, too
5307120	5311240	but best to move to had individual moves for everybody had
5311840	5315800	Easy mode which it was all just using fans with the arrows
5315800	5321320	You had the medium mode which is plays pretty much just like the first bus to move and he had mix mode which uses
5321960	5326320	The triangle scored everything and you also had attacks too, which you if you timed your tag
5326320	5328760	Just right you could completely botched their entire solo
5329480	5332760	Now really quickly here before we go to break because we got to kind of wrap the segment up
5332760	5337940	Why do you think this series kind of died off because you know, we had these games we had dance summit
5337940	5339940	Which was kind of met, you know
5340320	5343740	It's just it wasn't really the same. Why did this series?
5343740	5348580	Why haven't we seen more games in this series, especially with how popular music games have been in this day and age?
5348980	5353820	Because annex needs to get off their ass and just to do it, you know, we never got dance summit over here
5354220	5359740	And just to let and to give people a quick explanation dance summit is actually sort of a teen dance game
5360100	5362340	where you have team versus team and
5363740	5367160	Based on whatever your command button is at the end of your sequence
5367220	5371700	You have different people in your team that do different dance moves and different solo moves
5371700	5374580	we have like a bunch of people that look like heat from the first one and
5374700	5380320	it was a lot more interactive and had really good music and it even had a special controller that came out with it that had
5380700	5386620	something that you wear sort of like a grip that you would push the buttons and hold it sideways and
5388520	5392700	They really tried to innovate the series and I thought the best remove too was going in the right direction
5393460	5395940	But they haven't done anything else with it
5395940	5402820	I think that maybe because of how poorly dance summit did that maybe they thought that it was just time to end the series
5402820	5404820	I don't know sad, but
5405100	5409640	What they need to do is go back and do another one that plays like best move to
5410900	5416020	All right, we gotta wrap up but that is your classic game of the week folks. It is bust a move
5416020	5420540	How can you not like a game that has a gigantic voguing robot or if you're here in the u.s
5420540	5424660	You find it under bust a groove because I guess the name bust a move is already ten toward it
5424660	5426660	I
5426980	5432140	Didn't think the US version I had the US version of bust a bust a groove to I guess you could say it wasn't that
5432140	5436020	Bad I mean for you know Rob's first music game because I didn't know what else was out there
5436020	5438020	I had a blast with it, you know
5438180	5444740	According to sauce the series died off because people suck. I guess that is true real quickly called tippo and chat asked
5444740	5446740	What could they put in a bust a groove sequel?
5447060	5453560	Honestly, just more the same on next-gen get rid of online Xbox live get rid of bio bring that gas. Oh
5453560	5457600	Yeah, here's a great the Xbox what a great Xbox live arcade game
5457600	5462040	This might make that would be good and you know what they should have. I think hmm. They should have
5462880	5465840	You know, you can do create about rest, you know in wrestling games
5465840	5470500	You can do create a wrestler and customize all of their moves every single one based on what you put
5470500	5472280	all you have to do is
5472280	5478440	have a create a dancer mode and you'd give them different combo moves or give them a style of dance and
5478440	5486360	What you do is you go in and make your character the way you want them to and then give a sign their style of dance
5487440	5491080	All right. I think that that should come out another dream game
5491120	5491800	All right
5491800	5494680	There you have it here on orange lounge radio your classic game of the week
5494680	5498600	Bust a move or bust a groove depending on where you live. Did you at Loki? You've been awfully quiet
5498600	5502200	Did you ever play that series? I would think you've probably touched that at some point. I played a demo of
5502200	5509200	Bust a groove just wasn't the same thing. It was just didn't like it as much because there wasn't actual you didn't actually dance or anything
5509200	5511200	You know, it's just kind of
5511640	5516940	Can't please everybody. That's all right. All right, we are gonna take a quick break here on orange lounge radio
5517240	5518780	We're gonna do a quick break
