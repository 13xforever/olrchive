13968	22061	Tonight, April 13th, 2008, Brazil bans a popular video game, could BBC shows soon be coming to the Nintendo Wii?
22361	25667	And we interview Farbs, the creator of Rom Check Fail.
31198	36102	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36142	38503	A very special week for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
38904	43847	That's right, it's the first week of us live and exclusive on allgames.com.
43947	51253	The old chapter of our Orange Lounge Radio feed on Live 365 closed as of yesterday and now we're on our new home at allgames.com.
51293	55616	So a big hello to all of our new live listeners that we've got over at allgames.com.
56116	62181	and hello to those of you still joining us, be it through the podcast feed or our old OLR faithful or what be you.
62782	65084	Remember, you can always join our chat room to interact with the show.
65144	69087	Just a quick footnote for the live folks, it is a different chat room than all games usually uses.
69107	73791	You're going to want to head over to chat.orangeloungeradio.com or if you're already on the Game Surge Network.
74191	75952	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
104721	105962	to much to Bobby's dismay.
106022	108103	You do have the ferret here in the studio with us joining us.
108443	110884	Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
111164	111424	Hello.
111785	112345	How you doing, Loki?
112645	112865	Fine.
113205	113525	All right.
114246	116047	And you're full of pizza, if I'm not mistaken.
116067	118388	Yeah, breadsticks and stuff.
118528	121329	Yeah, when you came walking up to the door, you had like two pizza boxes.
121369	122650	I'm like, damn, Loki, you're fat.
124688	126129	Fat with a PH, Loki.
126349	126969	You know I love you.
127710	131672	But no, it was one pizza and one thing of bread.
131932	137055	By the way, we here at OLR, for those of you on all games who haven't heard our show before, we like food almost as much as we like video games.
138155	140737	I especially like video games about food.
141397	142157	Like Cooking Mama.
143078	147620	You know how some people say that they like to watch porn while they do it?
150041	152703	I like to eat food while I'm playing video games about food.
153979	158260	So while you're like playing Cooking Mama, do you actually cook things that you're cooking in Cooking Mama?
158900	163081	No, however, it did inspire me to try to make one of the dishes once.
163361	164321	We should try that one night.
164681	167881	We should do some, you know, Cooking Mama, like for reals.
168382	171222	The instructions in that game are actually semi-realistic.
171302	172002	I know.
172022	176123	A lot of those dishes are stuff I make anyway because I'm an awesome cook.
177283	177903	And so humble.
178403	179323	I know, I am.
180804	182284	But it's the same type of thing, you know.
183588	188753	Same situation, you know, to watch something and then, you know, participate, sort of.
189142	189662	DarkSakura.com
220003	220804	It was meaty, no.
221424	222005	So meaty.
222565	229230	No, my gaming week was actually, I know I always say it's pinball oriented, but this week was especially pinball oriented.
229870	236055	Because Dan is hosting his pinball group gathering tonight.
236675	241519	Hence another reason why I feel very blessed to be here tonight.
241899	245602	So I had to be around loud, stranger men that I don't know.
246687	253396	Anyway, so a lot of the week was actually spent testing out after shopping out some of the tables.
253857	257762	We've had his friend Will's Judge Dredd torn apart all over our garage right now.
258383	260466	And they just put it back together today and I hate that table.
260646	260906	Anyway...
261947	273898	We also went to one of our local used movie CD places called Dimple and we almost picked up some 7800 games, but then we remember that we probably already own them.
274799	285809	The way you know that you have too much in your collection is when you have to actually stop and ask yourself, do I own this or even worse, how many copies of this do I already have?
287335	292079	I've come home with a game for Dan, and now the unique thing about it is that I did have the manual in the box.
292139	292859	It's a 5200 game.
293099	294180	We had three other copies of it.
296502	300445	You need to get one of those little personal organizers just for your video game collections.
300505	302967	You can actually pull up an Excel spreadsheet on the go.
303007	304168	Like, do I have this game?
304508	305749	Does it have the manual with it?
305789	306249	Yes or no?
306570	308191	That's a pretty hardcore video game collector.
309312	312794	Well, we actually did have a list like that for a while.
313555	315576	And then I think we lost it in a computer crash.
316650	327673	and then we just were sort of like you've seen our vault oh yes we have an entire room dedicated to the collection and um it's sort of overwhelming now
328829	330190	It's actually a lot overwhelming now.
330210	332912	Have you ever thought, like, one of these days we just need to get rid of this shit?
332952	336135	Like, we need to call the 1-800-GOT-JUNK people or whatever it is.
336235	337116	Bite your tongue.
338717	338837	Ow.
338877	339958	It has been bitten.
340218	344261	Dan has said that we should get rid of some of it, and I'm like, you touch that collection, I kill you.
344942	346943	And then, when you're dead, it's all mine.
351987	353969	He'll divorce him when he's dead and then take over the collection.
354468	355329	I am the best wife ever
373786	376368	Do I want to buy a Virtual Boy system?
376388	377108	That's what I need to know.
377148	378749	Yes, you do want a Virtual Boy system.
378989	379469	Okay.
379710	380830	Well, how much do they want for it?
381471	380830	$75.
382031	384392	Actually, wait, I'm sorry.
384412	384893	I read that wrong.
385493	388415	It would be about $84.
388615	391396	Is that something you're looking at on eBay right now or something?
391516	391857	Yes.
393618	397520	Well, now that you just said that on air, everybody else is going to go look that up and jack the price up.
398100	398761	Let's buy it now.
399041	399761	Oh, buy it now.
399781	399861	Okay.
401482	403403	I don't know, it's a piece of gaming history
425439	427741	No, because you have to play.
427961	431825	In other words, you keep dying because there's no demo loop.
432786	438551	Have you ever thought of actually just like building like a mock cabinet and having just something that cycles like an emulator?
438891	445557	No, I don't want to build a cabinet for my desk because I think they'd be like, uh, what the hell's that in the office?
446638	447579	It's my new arcade cabinet.
447959	448980	Don't touch my arcade cabinet.
449481	450662	Actually, stuff that I played this week.
450762	454865	Yeah, I was going to say, you know, we here on Orange Lounge Radio, we like to stay on the current news, too.
455186	457287	Not just, you know, Virtual Boys and Atari 7800s.
457307	459949	Have you been playing, like, 360, Wii, any of that stuff?
461170	464213	This week I've only played two things, unfortunately.
464773	476322	First one, of course, is Multiplayer Saints Row, because we're still playing that damn game until we can get Grand Theft Auto 4, which I did find out today, well, not today, but earlier this week, that my boss is going to buy me a...
477543	493803	Special Edition of Grand Theft Auto 4 so that's awesome but at the same time I already pre-ordered another one just because you know we're going to need some for multiplayer and I think I need about two or three more copies on top of those too so five somewhere around there that reminds me I still have to fix my other 360 um
496149	501533	And then, other than Saints Row, I did play Mario Kart Wii.
501914	503255	A lot of Mario Kart Wii.
503315	507918	In fact, I've already finished 50cc and 100cc.
509459	511241	Of course, imported from the UK.
512422	514303	And, well, what can I say about the game?
514343	515024	It's Mario Kart.
516125	517886	I like some new levels that are in there.
517906	518667	I think they're really cool.
519531	522433	The only thing that... A couple gripes I have about the game.
522653	527016	Some of the levels that they chose, like the classic levels, are kind of stupid choices.
527036	527796	Rainbow Road.
528757	532619	They're not... Well, Rainbow Road's kind of annoying, but that's just Rainbow Road.
533440	535121	Especially even the battle modes.
535141	538043	The battle courses that they chose are just kind of crappy.
538163	539364	Which Rainbow Road did they bring over?
539764	540284	Thanks for watching!
556098	559923	I really think they could have chosen better tracks as well from the classic stuff.
559943	564849	Because there's a lot that just kind of resemble other tracks in the game that are already there.
565109	569554	I mean, there's three tracks that are kind of like the Donkey Kong... What was it?
569574	570656	The one from...
571917	572417	Double Dash.
572598	579062	They're kind of like that, where you have a giant cannon that launches you to the top of the track and you race down back to the cannon and stuff.
579642	580763	So, it's alright.
581964	584005	Some other weird gripes about it.
584105	586187	Battle mode is only team based.
586427	590169	You cannot play against individual people.
590570	590730	What? !
591212	594694	Yeah, you can only play against, you have to be on one team or the other.
594734	598356	So if you have three people or four people and you want to battle each other, well, you can't.
598957	600898	You have to be on two-man teams.
601238	601939	That sucks.
602379	603239	Yeah, it's retarded.
603400	604200	I wonder why they did that.
604260	607982	You would think that's something that, you know, doesn't take a whole lot of extra programming.
608042	609323	Oh, yeah, it's just lazy.
609383	610044	That's all it is.
610164	610764	Interesting.
611064	611785	That's a weird change.
612085	613886	Yeah, so that sucks.
615007	619730	Other than that, though, you can customize a lot of stuff in there, like different item drops.
621716	636442	I tried some of the ones that drop like the really supposedly big items like the more powerful items more frequently versus the normal drops and I didn't notice a difference so I don't know it's not very useful but
637122	638383	Try it online a little bit.
638723	641124	I was hardly able to get into any games right now.
641224	644345	Online is kind of crappy as far as connecting to a game.
644385	646646	But once you're in the game, it's fine.
646806	649347	I like the way that they have it where you pick courses and stuff.
649668	651248	You basically choose a course that you want.
651268	656591	Then the computer randomly selects which player's choice gets picked and stuff.
656611	657331	So that's kind of neat.
657671	658392	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
675672	676532	But yeah, it's okay.
676693	686997	I'm not very good at... I like playing as Yoshi or the medium carts, so it's not very fast and I get beat pretty quick sometimes.
687198	688418	But I like the tracks.
688918	691239	Some of the Mii integration in the game is pretty funny.
691259	699764	Especially there's a mall level that you play in and there's a bunch of signs and stuff that are all throughout the mall with different Miis on there.
699784	701504	And it's randomly selected each time you play the game.
702165	704906	So there was one that I was driving through
704926	711768	The very first time I played them all, my Chuck Norris Mii was on the coffee advertisement.
711788	713769	Then there's another one with Jesus on there.
714209	718691	And then later on in the level, you saw Hitler driving a car and stuff.
718931	721412	Just absolutely funny stuff.
721572	724453	And there's Goatse Mii driving a car one time.
724473	727954	But for some reason, it likes selecting Saddam and Hitler Mii's.
728434	730555	I don't know why, but I see them the most frequently.
731255	731475	All right.
754016	759701	DarkSakura's Mii always looks angry because she picked the little pointy eyebrows to make her look mad all the time, which is great.
781519	792783	So, yeah, you can play the game, and then eventually you unlock the Mii, the Drive S, which, here's my other gripe, and I haven't, I could be wrong about this, but I haven't tried multiplayer with it yet.
794123	798204	In single player, when you're playing as the Mii character, you can't select which Mii it uses.
798544	800845	It's only the one that you assign to your license.
801365	805247	So you can't swap it between other things, which is another lazy thing that they've done.
806747	810888	And it also has the most retarded voice I've ever heard for a character.
811289	813809	It's like a retarded Mario voice.
813849	818091	It's like... It's like, what the hell is that?
818971	820932	It sounds like Goat Boy Me or something.
820972	821912	What the hell is that?
822232	824513	I don't know, but... Can you make that sound again for us?
826314	826734	There you go.
827094	828954	So, I don't know.
829014	829595	I like the game.
829775	833116	I like it a lot better than Smash Bros., but I love Mario Kart, so...
834905	835345	What can I say?
853467	856610	What actually you thought was Jesus was just Bobby.
856890	857391	It could have been.
857471	857952	Possibly.
858712	859473	Looking at some other comments.
859493	867321	Some folks were talking about Mario Kart Double Dash because, you know, not everybody's played Mario Kart Wii yet, obviously, so it's been inspiring some talk about Mario Kart Double Dash.
867881	871565	And Osfer speaking up for Double Dash, saying Double Dash was some fun shit.
872346	876290	And Sephiroth1215 saying, yeah, see, I really don't understand why people don't like Double Dash.
877625	878306	It was okay.
878386	878906	It's just... Okay.
879266	882189	The thing I didn't like about Double Dash is the battle mode really sucked.
882449	884771	Like, the levels that they made for it, just awful.
885532	899984	And even some of the levels in... Oh, that's the other thing, too, about... I don't remember the other Mario games too well, the Mario Kart games, but from what I remember before, you didn't have a point limit or a time limit.
900624	900824	So...
901625	905867	In the battle mode this time, you have a three-minute time limit for each game that you play.
906007	911010	You can't just keep playing until someone loses, which is kind of lame.
912271	916933	And when you lose all your balloons, you just get them all back, and it just keeps counting more scores.
916973	918574	So the balloons are kind of pointless, too.
919715	920175	Interesting.
921169	921950	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
939463	951406	But the good news is, though, for those that may have heard different stories claiming otherwise, the Classic Controller and the GameCube Controller are not gimped in any way whatsoever, so you can play them just fine with it.
951486	953186	In fact, I use the Classic Controller for these games.
953206	957107	But I mentioned there's got to be a huge difference between using an analog stick to control something and using the motion.
957147	958388	There's got to be a huge difference.
958428	959848	Yeah, I don't like the motion at all.
960088	963489	And doing all the gestures that do different things, it's not very fun.
963509	963949	Interesting.
965993	967814	I prefer the classic controller of the GameCube.
985678	986879	I can't stand Toadette.
987560	988180	Toadette sucks.
1002448	1003229	I don't know.
1003289	1004530	Overall, it's a pretty cool game.
1005632	1007333	I just wish there were some better tracks.
1007994	1010116	Some of the classic tracks that they picked were kind of stupid.
1010536	1016522	Just like, kind of, well, this track's easy, the remakes, so let's just pick this one instead of actually picking good tracks.
1016763	1018024	That's my only gripe.
1018765	1020887	But other than that, it is an awesome game.
1021866	1024668	DS Chargers, but they don't carry the ones you can plug in the wall.
1049807	1056729	So, and I wasn't able to convince them to take me over to a GameStop or whatever, so I was just like, alright, so I'm just gonna, I guess, watch TV.
1056749	1062131	And then it dawned on me, even though my parents, they only have a 56.6K dial-up connection to the internet.
1062311	1064912	Oh my god, so slow when you're spoiled with broadband.
1065272	1067412	But they have the 56.6K connection to the internet.
1067852	1069013	I downloaded emulators.
1069933	1070994	Super Nintendo Games I'd Missed
1095752	1096833	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1119551	1120251	Do you like a cleric?
1141591	1143492	Sort of, but I don't think that's what he's called in the game.
1143813	1146614	He's just a hero, is what he's called.
1146855	1147795	He's a goat whisperer.
1147995	1151478	Well, in my game, he was called Butters, because you can name him whatever you want.
1151498	1153579	So I named him Butters, because I like that name.
1154119	1157522	Yeah, so I played a lot of Soul Blazer this week.
1157722	1163466	Otherwise, as far as newer games go, I went back to an MMO this week that I haven't played in a while.
1163546	1165347	I hope it's not Final Fantasy XI.
1165587	1168929	It is not Final Fantasy XI, but you would still be surprised.
1168969	1170991	You know what MMO I played this week that I haven't played?
1171651	1172552	and DarkSakura
1196023	1200225	I actually downloaded the expansion, The Ambition of the Illuminous, or whatever it's called.
1201086	1203387	I've always jokingly called it The Abortion of the Illuminous.
1203427	1204267	Well, not on Xbox 360.
1204508	1204988	You can't get it.
1205288	1205508	Really?
1205808	1206789	I could have gotten it for you for free.
1207563	1208444	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1233806	1235067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1257462	1263486	I have not yet, though, gotten the mag and all this other stuff that supposedly PSU is bringing back some of the old school stuff from Phantasy Star Online, but I'm not that far off yet.
1263506	1265807	They've got the original four stages, too.
1266268	1272072	And I know that the people that are probably, if you're looking to play this game and you haven't done it yet, it's like 20 bucks now.
1272092	1272572	It's very cheap.
1272952	1277175	And Rob, casts can use four skills now.
1277255	1277916	That's about time.
1278700	1279481	Final Fantasy XI
1297702	1300784	Not too bad of a deal, I gotta say, if you want to get sucked into that crack.
1301144	1304826	So you have several MMO crack things to choose from on the Xbox 360.
1304906	1306347	Alright, that's going to do it for our gaming week.
1306367	1307407	That was quite a bit tonight.
1307587	1308628	We had a lot of games to talk about.
1309508	1311689	Let's talk about some housekeeping news.
1311869	1315231	Of course, last night the plug was pulled on our Live365 feed.
1315611	1316632	It's no longer there.
1317572	1318373	Speaking of Live365, oh my god.
1322040	1324401	I wrote them a cancellation email a week ago.
1324421	1326483	You're supposed to give them three business days to cancel, right?
1326523	1327823	I wrote them an email a week ago.
1328344	1328924	No response.
1329024	1330905	Wrote them a second notice like Thursday or Friday.
1330945	1331565	No response.
1331645	1332906	Guess who charged my card today?
1333326	1334067	The buttheads.
1335628	1336848	Does the fun ever start?
1337349	1340671	I'll keep you guys posted next week what happens with that.
1340831	1341831	We might have to get nasty.
1342772	1347634	Things keep going down this route because essentially they've taken money from me that I didn't pay for.
1347655	1348995	It's kind of pissing me off.
1349315	1350096	Call your bank and
1350703	1351364	That's what I'm going to do.
1351624	1352184	Stop payment.
1352224	1366235	So hello to allgames.com, our new home, which has deducted no money from my bank account this week, thankfully, because there are great people over at allgames.com who aren't sucking my money away, and they're friends, and we definitely urge you to check out the programming that's at allgames.com.
1366855	1368356	They have something new every night.
1368496	1372057	They re-air a bunch of podcasts that go on throughout the week.
1372117	1375739	Some of them have their debut on All Games Radio, so check that out.
1375779	1378400	We debut, of course, Sunday nights before us, Bobby Blackwolf.
1378740	1383122	In the morning times, All Games Interactive is on every day, Monday through Friday.
1383462	1387564	So that show's on, I think, 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and they go through most of the morning.
1388144	1390605	which would be actually early afternoon for the East Coast folks.
1390625	1394087	So it really works out great for the East Coast folks who have to stay up really late to listen to us.
1395307	1399910	And again, we want to remind you we have a special guest tonight, Farbs of Rom Check Fail fame.
1400450	1404652	And if you like Orange Lounge Radio, you want to get to know us a little better, join our social networking.
1404892	1408273	That's right, we're MySpace whores just like everybody else and Facebook and all that other stuff.
1408313	1410714	Our MySpace is MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1411035	1413756	We also have a live journal community at Orange Lounge, no radio.
1414376	1415338	and Facebook.
1415458	1424870	Just search for OL Army and you can add us on all those sites and stay tuned with all the news and when we shift networks and all that stuff you'll be on top of things and know where to catch us.
1425170	1429917	Apparently the chat room is loving the new sound by the way because our feed now is 96k.
1429937	1429977	So...
1432660	1436723	It's a lot clearer, the feed, than the 64K we were on with Live 365.
1436763	1437764	So they're really happy with that.
1438125	1444029	And I think our podcast listeners are going to notice we also changed the audio on the podcast to be similar to what we're broadcasting at now.
1444130	1446211	So it's going to be a whole new sound.
1446251	1446812	That's okay, Rob.
1446832	1448333	I'll just talk like this.
1449374	1451295	We'll ruin the audio quality of the show this way.
1451335	1452616	Yeah, we'll just do it this way.
1452817	1453537	All right.
1453938	1455439	How much are you going to disagree with me tonight?
1455479	1456840	What do you think I'll let you disagree with me tonight?
1457659	1459720	Anyways, let's see.
1460100	1469085	So this week, the publisher of Famitsu Magazine thinks that they have an idea of what may be happening on E3 this year, one of the announcements.
1470145	1475808	Their guess is that Nintendo is going to be announcing yet another revision of the DS.
1477149	1481111	And their thinking behind this is because the timing seems to be right.
1482071	1484693	Apparently every two years or so is when they...
1485673	1488556	Revise their portable systems.
1488596	1492439	For example, there was the 1996 Game Boy Pocket.
1492559	1494381	In 1998, there was the Game Boy Color.
1494501	1495802	In 2001, there was the Game Boy Advance.
1495882	1497844	In 2003, there was the Game Boy Advance SP.
1497904	1498805	In 2004, there was the DS.
1498925	1499586	In 2006, there was the DS Lite.
1499646	1499726	In 2008...
1512182	1512422	The DS Micro
1527628	1528048	Who knows?
1528449	1531411	Or maybe they'll just do nothing and won't they feel stupid?
1531451	1535093	Okay, so in other words, Famitsu Magazine is basically saying this.
1535834	1540417	Nintendo likes to redo shit and make you buy it all over again all the time.
1540677	1542318	So 2008 will be nothing new.
1542698	1542878	Yes.
1542959	1543919	Is essentially what they're saying.
1544259	1544480	Yes.
1544540	1545280	And this is news how?
1545840	1546141	I don't know.
1547682	1550704	It's news because... I don't know.
1551364	1552505	Because we're talking about E3.
1553606	1554967	And people like talking about E3.
1556628	1563473	Odd One says, but this time it's got, what the hell else can they do to this thing other than make it smaller or give it storage?
1564053	1565154	Ah, there's a thought.
1565514	1574820	What about turning the DS a little bit PSP-ish where, hey, not only is it a DS, but it plays MP3s and it has scheduling things.
1574880	1576001	I refuse to buy one if it does that.
1576241	1577722	Wait, wait, I gotta know this.
1577742	1578363	Why is that?
1579013	1581355	Because the same reason why I'm not too fond of the PSP.
1581915	1583176	It's got way too much shit in it.
1583496	1586899	If I want to play a game, I want a system that plays a game.
1587019	1588260	I have an iPhone already.
1588300	1588680	Hello?
1588801	1589441	I have to be honest.
1589461	1592884	That's kind of one thing I like about the PSP is that it's a little bit of everything.
1593344	1593864	You know what I mean?
1594225	1594925	I think it's kind of neat.
1594945	1598668	If you want your video game system to have everything, then that's fine.
1598688	1599629	If that's what you want.
1600029	1607735	But for me personally, because I already have the means to do all this other stuff, I really just want my system to play my video games.
1607915	1616379	Here's something, a thought, and I could see this happening more than I could see, say, a new system coming out.
1616479	1623602	Maybe an expansion that would plug into the bottom of the Game Boy Advance slot or whatever, and you would plug in your SD memory card, because guess what?
1623642	1628265	You have an SD memory card slot on your Wii, and so maybe this...
1629165	1631368	I don't know, device or whatever that you plug into the bottom.
1631509	1644587	That is flashable and that you can have firmware upgrades to and whatnot to allow it to play, say, emulate different games like the Virtual Console or stuff like that or WiiWare or something like that.
1646049	1659897	I can see that happening because that would be a little easier they can't just get rid of like if they make it a slimmer they're going to get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot then you're going to have stuff that uses it like say Guitar Hero on tour I don't think they're going to screw that over because that would be good for them
1662248	1664370	They can't get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot just yet.
1687026	1694789	So why would they give you a device where you could get all this shit basically for free from the virtual console when they could recharge for it and people would buy it?
1695349	1696930	Well, because I don't think people would buy it.
1697050	1705973	I think people would rather have a service available where they can download all these games and I think you'd get a lot more people downloading games.
1706033	1710015	It's a lot easier to download games on the virtual console and pay a lot more money that way.
1710335	1711956	That also saves some packaging.
1711996	1714977	They don't have to press any of these stupid cartridges.
1716433	1722018	I think the packaging and stuff, that would save them a lot of money, and it doesn't really cost them anything to transfer a file.
1722318	1730924	It's just, you know, basically what they're going to probably want to do is prevent people from pirating this stuff, and that's about it.
1731344	1742533	Because right now with those other SD memory card things, yeah, you can pirate games like No End, but they'd have to create something that you wouldn't be able to do that.
1744170	1744991	Well, we'll see what happens.
1745011	1746951	And besides, think of all the other things you could do.
1747012	1751133	I mean, it's essentially just like that PlayOn thing that they have available now.
1751393	1756596	You could use that as Game Boy, you know, not necessarily for, you know, virtual console games and stuff like that.
1757016	1764339	MP3s, you can use it for, like, maybe small media files, you know, playing a really, really, really low-res movie or something like that, you know.
1764939	1766720	Like, think of, I don't know, your...
1768305	1769686	Thanks for watching!
1786457	1786878	DarkSakura
1802618	1812183	And we talked about this a little bit last week, and this is a bit of a follow-up, is that there was a rumor that Final Fantasy IV was, yes, it's going to be North American bound because it showed up on the cover of Nintendo Power and all this stuff.
1812524	1814445	Well, Squeenix confirmed it this week.
1814505	1821809	Final Fantasy IV will be coming out July 22nd in North America, which is a little bit off from the date I seem to recall Loki mentioning last week.
1821849	1823509	Well, they revised it, bumped it up a week.
1824050	1825150	All because of you, probably, right?
1825471	1825571	Yeah.
1825591	1825991	I'm just kidding.
1826591	1830354	It is, of course, Final Fantasy IV with some graphical upgrades.
1830394	1834936	They also get this fully voiced cutscenes and other added content.
1835016	1838358	So that's going to be interesting, this whole mini-movie thing.
1838479	1842781	And then my mistake from last week, it wasn't Dragon Quest V, it was Dragon Quest IV.
1843922	1845163	Oh, okay.
1845203	1847944	That's also on its way, but that's a secret type thing, right?
1847984	1848965	Shh, secret.
1851215	1853837	Alright, so we'll see what happens next from Squeenix.
1854197	1865066	I guess that's probably why this game has taken a long time to come out from Japan to the US is because they're having to redo the voices now too, which I'm sure can't be an easy thing on the DS because then they have to go basically remake the whole cartridges and all that.
1865146	1867988	So please, voice acting, don't suck in this.
1868108	1871971	Please do not ruin my fond, fond memories of Final Fantasy 4 or I'll cry.
1872232	1874313	I just see why they can't leave it intact.
1875274	1875854	But no.
1876515	1876975	But no.
1877335	1879017	Maybe the classic version will be in there somewhere.
1879057	1879397	I don't know.
1879857	1880298	One can hope.
1880902	1893406	Well, at any rate, something else that has made a lot of people on the internet go squee, but not squeenix, okay, is a Strong Bad game coming to WiiWare, and I am very happy about this.
1893787	1894587	Did you watch the trailer?
1895527	1896528	I have not seen the trailer yet.
1896548	1898908	Remember, I was on 56.6k most of the week.
1899549	1908912	The trailer is hilarious, but there is a game coming out called Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, which is, yeah...
1909571	1909871	SBCG4AP
1937042	1939444	And they're the ones that did the Sam & Max games.
1940645	1940905	Are they?
1941366	1941946	Interesting.
1942046	1945409	Speaking of which, that Sam & Max for the Wii, that's season one.
1946190	1946410	Only.
1946710	1947350	Only season one.
1947511	1948411	Oh, thank you for the update.
1948431	1949472	Appreciate it.
1949512	1950593	But it should be reasonable.
1954130	1955351	Well, there's going to be a trailer.
1955371	1957712	The trailer is actually posted in our chat room right now.
1957752	1961193	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com from Tigerclaw found it on YouTube and dug that up.
1961773	1966755	Going back to the last story because there's a lot of comments on the voice chat on Final Fantasy IV.
1966775	1968736	Going back to some comments from our chat room.
1969236	1969577	Let's see.
1969697	1975459	Jonathan F. is fantasizing Final Fantasy VI with voices because you would have the opera scene with singing.
1975919	1977520	Celeste would actually sing the opera.
1977560	1978440	That could go either way.
1979861	1980201	DRAGON QUEST 4
2004174	2016538	Shadow Slayer thinks it could be good if they get good voice actors Odd One says it's dependent on how big the card for the game is and Zeppelin says why can't they put one to two gigabyte in a DS card?
2016558	2017758	I'm pretty sure they can, can't they?
2018178	2018898	I think they can.
2019338	2019638	Why not?
2019678	2025380	If your camera can fit like two gigabytes I'm sure those DS cards can crank in like four gigabytes on those cards.
2025400	2027021	You'd probably get some pretty massive games on there.
2029141	2030522	So this is another rumor.
2030542	2032082	Was there more on the Strong Bad stuff?
2033155	2034375	I had more to say.
2034495	2034775	Oh, sure.
2035275	2036016	But that's okay.
2036616	2038796	Well, there's nobody in chat commenting on it either.
2038836	2040236	What do you guys think of the Strong Bad game?
2040357	2043317	Oh, Black Wolf says the Strong Bad game is also coming to the PC.
2044037	2047278	So if you don't want to download that on the Wii, you can also get it on the PC.
2047458	2051859	Well, I was going to say the type of game is a 3D point.
2052519	2054839	To actually quote a quote from Strong Bad.
2055680	2055960	Okay.
2056620	2059961	It is a puffy 3D point and click them up adventure.
2060441	2061821	You need to do it in the Strong Bad voice.
2062021	2062101	No.
2064597	2065858	Dan can do the strong and bad voice.
2066699	2067100	I cannot.
2069362	2071144	You can turn the light switch on or off.
2072446	2073166	That's all I remember.
2073487	2073767	All right.
2075489	2077371	I did not install it so you could have a light switch rave.
2078192	2079153	What do you think?
2079834	2080855	Winner or sellout?
2082253	2083334	I hope so.
2083374	2084234	It all depends on the game.
2084474	2088916	But that's hopeful if it's the same folks that did Sam and Max.
2088956	2089277	We'll see.
2090417	2094679	Another game that hopefully will be coming soon, Elebits 2.
2096260	2105705	And of course, this is coming from the latest issue of the official Nintendo magazine, reporting that Elebits 2 will be due out on the Wii later this year.
2106145	2110848	Which is odd, because I thought it was supposed to be due out on the DS later this year.
2111568	2120412	Either way, it'll be coming to a Nintendo system this year, probably, and hopefully won't be just mediocre like the last game.
2122873	2125934	I kind of like the last game, with the level designs and stuff like that.
2125994	2131476	The last game was kind of neat, but there was something about it that didn't keep me there long-term, you know what I mean?
2131516	2133197	I don't know if I just felt like there wasn't a...
2134226	2134786	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2157576	2159237	Now they have a lot more they can play with.
2160258	2165120	I'm sure technologies have come along in developing the Wii games as well as online possibly, which could be interesting.
2165140	2172904	I don't know what they could do with a DS version of the game because a lot of that game required you to be able to pull on the remote and twist it and stuff like that.
2174485	2180488	It'd be hard to not have that depth sensing that the Wii version had in the DS version.
2182659	2184180	Some comments from chat on Elebits.
2184220	2185860	Sephiroth1215 not happy from this.
2186000	2187261	Ah, no, I hate Elebits.
2187741	2190302	And RawSteelUT says, it's Elebits, no one cares.
2191982	2194723	Frisbee wants to mention it was a launch title in Japan.
2195464	2199005	Quiltipo says, Elebits seemed good at the time, but no staying power though.
2199385	2202806	And Gerardimo says, Elebits was good and innovative, just shallow.
2203206	2205007	That might actually be a good way of phrasing it.
2206001	2206521	But I don't know.
2206601	2209062	I mean, you really want to appreciate Elebits, but I don't know.
2209082	2210163	It just kind of got old quick.
2210563	2213724	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join in the fun here on this Sunday night.
2214124	2216625	Remember, we are on a new network, AllGames.com.
2217006	2217886	At this time, we're not.
2217966	2220927	It's just too much to read the All Games chat and the Orange Lounge chat.
2221107	2225929	And we have people chatting on Justin.TV as well who thinks I'm neglecting them over on Justin.TV.
2225969	2226450	I'm not.
2227010	2234033	It's just a lot to read and try to do a show at the same time and bring you more gaming news like this one about the white...
2234693	2235974	GameCube Controllers
2262953	2277767	and now Mario Kart Wii we know is going to support the GameCube controller so this is going to be coming out in Japan but the odd thing is why not a WaveBird controller that would make so much more sense because the WaveBird was pretty awesome I don't know if it's a cost thing or what
2278737	2280158	But who knows if this will be coming out here.
2281039	2282780	It's actually a lot sooner and later this year.
2282820	2287223	That is coming out later this month, according to Nintendo of Japan's website.
2287743	2289204	So, pretty cool.
2289945	2293267	I don't know, do you think they ought to bring white wavebirds to the Wii?
2293888	2297830	Or does it matter because if you didn't buy one... Because there already are wavebirds?
2298151	2298371	Huh?
2298611	2300212	Because there already are wavebirds?
2300672	2301593	But they don't make them anymore.
2301913	2302173	So?
2302974	2305696	So you're basically saying screw you to everyone who didn't get one, like me.
2307717	2308398	I can bring them over.
2308578	2309018	You suck.
2309419	2316405	But honestly, and I'll tell you this, remember when they came out with those different colored controllers for the GameCube?
2317305	2317846	Well, um...
2319671	2320672	GameStop, GameCrazy
2345216	2348398	You sometimes see these little random import things too at random stores.
2348418	2350179	You just kind of have to look around, you know what I mean?
2350199	2367429	I'll tell you one, our oddest find as far as import anything went at actual GameStop was buying Capcom Classic Collection Volume 2, which was the Ghosts and Goblins, the Makai Mura, Dai Makai Mura.
2367449	2368510	But it never came out here, right?
2368690	2370251	No, we never got that collection.
2370551	2372252	We got the Japanese one.
2373693	2373853	Hmm.
2374564	2377066	at a GameStop in Hilltop Mall.
2378126	2381728	Several people in chat, by the way, mentioning that the WaveBirds did not have Rumble.
2381808	2384330	Perhaps that's the reason Nintendo is deciding not to do it.
2385030	2388072	Because Sony learned the hard way, you gotta have Rumble.
2389593	2394936	Rumble is not so last gen, as they tried to say at E3 a couple years ago.
2394976	2396497	They learned the hard way, so maybe that's why.
2396817	2399979	But why, I mean, is a WaveBird with Rumble that hard to do?
2400885	2401446	I mean, is it?
2402287	2402788	I don't know.
2402888	2403749	Maybe it's just me.
2403909	2404690	It's impossible.
2404710	2407914	If the Xbox 360 wireless can do rumble, I would think.
2409376	2409997	Maybe it's just me.
2410878	2413121	It's not that hard.
2413362	2413922	I didn't think so.
2414503	2417527	I mean, I'm not even, no, no, no, no, no.
2417747	2418228	All right, moving on.
2418615	2419415	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2435121	2438982	And if you don't know anything about Soul Eater, there's a Wikipedia article, so enjoy.
2439423	2442744	But it will be coming to the U.S.
2443384	2445244	Actually, my apologies.
2445905	2449086	So far, it's listed as Japan only, and I don't think it's going to be coming out anywhere else.
2452187	2456968	I mean, because honestly, I don't even think the Soul Eater manga has come out over in the U.S., has it?
2458349	2460450	You're asking the wrong guy about when it comes to manga.
2460470	2461230	The whole point of the...
2462889	2476873	of the, I guess, manga is that these people are going to this technical school to make weapons and have to make this one weapon out of 99 evil human souls and one belonging to this witch to make a death scythe.
2477333	2480134	Which I think death scythe, and I think back to Gundam Wing, so whatever.
2480714	2482575	Well, the way you describe it, it sounds kind of cool.
2482835	2484335	Yeah, it would be something I would read.
2484375	2485976	But I don't know if that's something that would come out here.
2486456	2488096	No, I mean, I don't know.
2488176	2490997	I'll read the manga, I guess.
2492025	2492905	I almost bought that game on DS.
2517199	2518841	I'll Never Forgive Him for that PlayStation 1.
2519001	2519742	What was PlayStation 1?
2519902	2520803	Was that Legend of Mana?
2520883	2521304	Legend of Mana.
2521344	2522505	Oh my god, I hated that game.
2522525	2523726	You know what my problem with Legend of Mana was?
2523746	2524207	I hated that game.
2524607	2524848	What?
2525388	2527451	I imported it like a dumbass.
2528232	2534999	And that was the most text-intensive, kanji-heavy game I have ever freaking played.
2535962	2539883	and I could read like five words on an entire page.
2540123	2542444	You know what other Squeenix collection I can't stand?
2542544	2545444	And they've done more than one games in the series and I can't even remember the name of it.
2545864	2549665	It's the one where there's like eight different people and they have the eight stories.
2549685	2550506	Saga Frontier.
2550526	2552146	I freaking hate the Saga series.
2552626	2553506	Cannot stand it.
2553646	2555827	Sorry, RPG fans and Saga fans, but...
2557701	2567728	If you thought that, you know, because I do give Final Fantasy a lot of love here on the show, Chrono series, things like that, but if you thought that Squeenix could do no wrong, just go play the Saga series sometime.
2567748	2568629	It's pretty good.
2569430	2571651	Why didn't they ever carry on, like, the Tobol series?
2571931	2572632	I like that one.
2572792	2574433	What about Alundra?
2574813	2577555	Or Brave Fencer Musashi was them, wasn't it?
2577876	2579056	Yeah, they did a new one.
2579076	2580097	Those were cute.
2580337	2581318	I like PlayStation 2.
2581358	2581878	Yeah.
2584272	2591759	So, this is also another article kind of correcting some more wrongs with Mario Kart Wii.
2592299	2596663	Apparently, there was news before that Mario Kart Wii did not work with the Freeloader.
2597143	2598825	However, that is false.
2598985	2601968	It actually does work just fine with the Freeloader.
2602028	2603689	So, if you happen to live in the U.S.
2603749	2606191	and want to pick up a copy of the European version...
2607212	2609373	and get it a few weeks before we get it here.
2610073	2614675	Then go right ahead and pick one up because the freeloader will work just fine.
2615255	2624698	In fact, import retailer NCS tested the game on a version 3.1 firmware and it ran just fine.
2625118	2630140	And apparently there was some issues, I guess, with 3.0 firmware.
2630160	2632581	So if you update your firmware, it should be good to go.
2634522	2635642	But I don't know.
2636803	2637143	Great game.
2663666	2668987	Well, apparently on Mario Kart Wii, there are already people cheating in there.
2669348	2671268	And it's in the time trials mode, apparently.
2671328	2675349	There's all these impossible times that are showing up in the time trials mode.
2676089	2680691	Apparently, somebody on the official Nintendo Magazine forums wrote this on here.
2680791	2682451	I only saw it on the snowboard track.
2682731	2685592	There was a guy with a time of 53 points, something or other seconds.
2685872	2688633	There are about three other people with exactly the same time.
2689133	2695963	Like others have said, on the replay, the guy just does one lap really slow and then turns the opposite way just after the finish line.
2696264	2697666	Then the replay doesn't stop.
2698447	2700850	So he says, personally, I think it's a bug.
2700890	2703975	I've only seen it on one track and there are others with the same time.
2705136	2723391	Apparently what's happening, and I'm not positive this is actually the case, but what I heard was that if you let the time trial sit there for longer than 99 minutes and 99 seconds and .99, it'll actually loop back around to zero again.
2723571	2733659	So people were racing through a couple laps or whatever, and then they would stop, wait for it to just barely flip over from
2734680	2736862	You know, who has time to do that?
2737022	2737662	I mean, really?
2737702	2742425	You're going to sit there and wait for 99 minutes or even, you know, just leaving it on, doing that.
2742486	2744127	I don't know what the hell you're doing, you know, going up.
2744147	2744787	Obsessed people.
2744967	2751572	Going out drinking or something and coming back 90 minutes later just to have a high score.
2753573	2755154	That we all know is a piece of crap.
2755394	2760596	Well the thing about that too though, Nintendo has actually removed those scores off of their leaderboards now.
2760676	2763937	So Nintendo is cracking down.
2763977	2767898	Now I'm just waiting for it to happen where people find a way to cheat in the multiplayer mode.
2767918	2768438	You know what I mean?
2768778	2770559	That's going to be a... Oh my god.
2771939	2775421	I hope Nintendo knows a way to patch this game on the fly if things like that happen.
2777181	2777681	We'll see.
2778962	2779282	I don't know.
2779302	2782143	I don't think they have it built in yet where they can patch games.
2783682	2786264	I know they don't have it built in yet where they can patch games.
2787065	2789507	Does their firmware updates patch the games?
2789527	2792029	There's firmware updates, but I don't think they patch games.
2793270	2797393	The good thing, though, is they don't have an action replay yet for the Wii.
2797433	2800575	They only have game saves and power saves and stuff like that.
2802837	2803297	I don't know.
2803478	2809923	There shouldn't really be a way to cheat, unless you do something with the servers or whatever where you lag someone out.
2810003	2810143	But
2811363	2814206	Plus it just goes back to, if you're cheating online, why?
2814786	2815347	You know, why?
2815487	2815747	Really?
2815787	2816708	What do you got to prove?
2816728	2817629	I don't know.
2817709	2818150	You know what I mean?
2818170	2825677	Like, oh, you beat three other strangers in an online Mario match when Nintendo doesn't even tell you who you're playing against.
2825717	2827178	I mean, it's kind of like, big wow.
2827879	2828199	You know?
2828280	2830542	It's like, do you really have to feel that special?
2830962	2831323	I don't know.
2831983	2832524	Maybe it's just me.
2833846	2841940	Well, speaking of special people, you know that there's always that time top 100 most influential people that they do.
2842661	2844204	And guess who's on the list this year?
2845105	2845266	Hmm.
2845754	2846295	Miyamoto!
2847035	2847976	He is on the list this year.
2848176	2848396	Nice.
2849657	2856383	He has been voted for 25,000 times as of the source I'm reading.
2856803	2858184	So he's at number 31 out of 200.
2858625	2863689	And is at 56%.
2863989	2868553	And basically he's been put on there for making Mario and Zelda...
2869313	2887578	and uh for uh the new Wii stuff you know the things he's trying to do with the Wii um and that and as he's been quoted saying that he wants to make people more aware of their bodies and get in better shape and and use that as a tool to improve their life and not just slack around you know
2888118	2891159	How much influence does the online poll have in the final result?
2906425	2907405	Captain America's Shield
2932110	2935912	Hey, some comments from Justin TV, actually, who says I ignore them all the time.
2935992	2938513	But a good comment here about the whole patching of Wii games.
2939093	2944195	Richie Maniac says they can't patch, otherwise they would have fixed Guitar Hero 3 without sending out new discs.
2944775	2945475	Very good point.
2945815	2948977	So if somebody's cheating in Mario Kart, there's nothing they can do about it.
2949257	2952058	Well, I'm putting the link to vote for Miyamoto in the chat room.
2952498	2953978	But you could cheat however much you want.
2957623	2959964	and BlackWolf is correcting me and saying it's Colbert.
2960004	2961525	I thought that was just something he did on the show.
2961665	2962745	Is his last name really Colbert?
2962765	2964826	I thought that was just a show joke.
2965026	2974531	I know people with the exact same last name in real life, but they pronounce it with the hard T. That's why it's the Colbert Report.
2974551	2976412	I thought that was a joke.
2977312	2978273	People, don't correct me, okay?
2980114	2980934	This is pissing me off.
2980974	2981494	It's hot in here.
2982655	2983835	It is hot in here today.
2984235	2984936	What is up with the weather?
2985515	2991337	Well, there's another game that got announced this week during Nintendo's Media Summit.
2992097	2994378	And this is not really a big surprise at all.
2994418	3001300	In fact, I want to say we've already seen this being announced at E3 last year, but whatever.
3002621	3007122	Anyways, it is Super Mario, or I should say Mario Super Sluggers.
3008123	3008243	And...
3009753	3015241	It is, of course, a continuation of Super Mario Stadium Baseball.
3017003	3025735	Just another sports game from Nintendo that's capitalizing on Mario, just like Mario Strikers and stuff.
3027257	3039464	I hope they don't do this, but I could just see them, because they're kind of following the bad trends that third-party companies are creating accessories for, like those attachments for the Wii Sports stuff.
3040045	3044207	I could just see them releasing this game with a baseball bat attachment or something for the Wii.
3045668	3047269	I don't know, try to sell a few more copies.
3047289	3047409	Yeah.
3047489	3048289	Here's my question.
3048329	3051991	What really is the difference between the Super Sluggers thing and the Strikers?
3052091	3053792	I mean, aren't they just kind of both baseball games?
3054212	3056893	No, Strikers is a soccer game, whereas Sluggers is a baseball game.
3056953	3057994	Oh, what the hell am I thinking?
3058094	3061456	Why am I... But there's another... Wasn't there another... Yeah, there was Mario Baseball.
3061616	3065578	Yeah, I know there's another baseball game that already freaking came out on the Wii.
3065658	3065878	Really?
3065918	3066358	It was on the GameCube?
3066378	3067058	No, it was on the GameCube, yeah.
3068359	3070480	I could have sworn there was already a baseball game on the Wii.
3070700	3072881	No, just like how there was... Was it...
3074042	3078223	I don't remember what the other... There was another soccer game that was on GameCube as well.
3079223	3083465	So it's just import whatever sport with Mario in it.
3084585	3086465	Pretty soon it'll be Mario synchronized swimming.
3087566	3088446	Just in time for the Beijing Olympics.
3088466	3092547	I don't see how there could be any popular Japanese franchise that won't have a baseball game attached to it.
3092947	3093687	I guess that's true.
3093887	3095488	Baseball is like the sport.
3096136	3096796	I guess that's true.
3096876	3097996	And guess what, Rob?
3098116	3101957	You'll be happy to know that Toadette is in this game as well.
3102157	3102437	Bitch.
3102918	3103498	Alright.
3104218	3108399	RossSteelUT in chat.orangelearn.com says, Oh, baseball on the Wii.
3108459	3109899	This will appeal to the fanboys, really.
3110219	3111720	The casuals still have Wii Sports.
3112140	3115500	Well, I would think that baseball fanboys would go for something a little more hardcore.
3115560	3116541	Like MLB 2K8?
3116841	3118701	I don't know if it would necessarily be on the Wii.
3118721	3121962	Or MLB Power Pros, you know, where it was just another baseball game?
3122202	3122262	Or...
3122742	3124784	They've already got, like, plenty of baseball games on there.
3124824	3128888	I would think these are the people that do like baseball on Wii Sports, but want to take it, like, one step further.
3128908	3129669	You know what I mean?
3129689	3130089	I don't know.
3130349	3133272	I don't know how appealing that is, but Jamie does have a good point.
3133312	3135254	Especially over in Japan, baseball is huge.
3135274	3136795	And, you know, baseball's huge here, too.
3137496	3140599	It may not be as big as football in this day and age, but...
3140799	3143501	That's fine, this game will come out in the E3 or whatever.
3144141	3155208	I have a feeling, because I heard some rumors before that this was going to be coming out in June, and then in July there was supposed to be that stupid disaster day of crisis.
3155948	3166215	I don't remember what blog I read that in, but if this does come out and stuff, and then E3 rolls around, and oh, guess what, Wii Sports 2, and it's like, ah, shit, I just bought this game, and now...
3167015	3172401	WeSports 2, which is going to be probably the number one selling game all time on Wii.
3173001	3173802	Mario Hockey.
3173882	3175724	Several people want to see that game in our chatroom.
3175764	3176685	A Mario Hockey game.
3177065	3181169	I don't know, though, because I think Nintendo might have a problem with people punching Mario in the face.
3181209	3186835	Mario Hockey, all that would be is just like Super Mario Strikers with re-skin, basically, because...
3187435	3188276	You know what they need?
3188416	3190777	They need to bring back old school ice hockey.
3190937	3192358	I actually had this game on the NES.
3192398	3196922	I'm not talking Blades of Steel, although that game was freaking rad too, but I'm talking old school ice hockey.
3196982	3203466	Remember this game where you had your entire team consisted of the fat guys, the skinny guys, and the average guys.
3203526	3204026	Remember that?
3204327	3204527	Yeah.
3204887	3205627	That's what they need to do.
3205767	3207929	Ice Hockey 2008, or Ice Hockey Wii.
3208890	3209610	That'd be rad.
3211491	3212132	You know you want it.
3212742	3215844	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3233452	3235953	On the Nintendo Wii, nothing either.
3236213	3239874	This is a dry week in Japan for these next batch of systems.
3240215	3245616	But if you want to go back to the PlayStation 2, Ape Escape 3 is coming out now in a Chinese language.
3246137	3249738	So for the other Asian regions abroad, Ape Escape 3 comes out in Chinese this week.
3250098	3254560	Also a game called Hoshigari Empusa comes out in Japan on April the 17th.
3255960	3262248	and going over to the Nintendo DS, Gear Spirit from TV Animation One Piece.
3262348	3262968	Gear Spirit.
3263629	3266412	Also from Nintendo, Pack'n Ball comes out.
3267369	3267809	S, Actdeft, Drew,
3290080	3297925	Also on the Nintendo DS, Kansu Hajime Yoshisan Unyo DS comes out.
3299626	3301307	And this is just... I don't know.
3301968	3304810	The cover has a bunch of people planting trees on it.
3305270	3309032	And I don't know if that's supposed to symbolize a tree of knowledge or what that is.
3309052	3311334	Because the category for the game is miscellaneous.
3311774	3315276	Which usually means some type of boring training type thing.
3315296	3316617	I don't think it's a dating sim.
3316657	3318598	Because you actually use the touch screen and stuff.
3319259	3319439	But...
3319921	3321542	It's a perverted dating sim, no.
3321622	3322863	No, not that kind of dating.
3322883	3324685	It's not like, you know, I don't know.
3324705	3325425	I'm joking, Rob.
3327787	3331950	Let's see if there's anything coming out on the PSP, although I somehow doubt it.
3331990	3335133	But we'll take a look real quick for the PSP in Japan.
3335713	3335953	No.
3336674	3338295	But the 24th will be a big week.
3338455	3341237	There's lots more stuff coming out for you folks in Japan on the 24th.
3341277	3344000	But this week, you're going to have to just play the games you already have, I guess.
3346702	3347042	That's it.
3348385	3358312	For the games that are coming out for our friends over in the UK, we have on the 16th, Trackmania Nations Forever on PC.
3359333	3360234	Trackmania.
3360254	3362035	This is going to look pretty awesome.
3363936	3364216	Is it?
3365958	3366158	Yeah.
3366498	3366718	Okay.
3367259	3369680	I want that Konami track game where you can play as Pyramid Head.
3369700	3370741	That's the one I'm waiting for.
3370821	3371542	I know, right?
3371562	3372302	The new track and field?
3372703	3372903	Yeah.
3373803	3374644	Do you want?
3375264	3376505	The hell with all the other track games.
3376525	3376846	July or August.
3376866	3377346	All right, thank you.
3379097	3385144	Anyway, also coming out, now this is on the 18th of this next series of games, which is the day before my birthday.
3386145	3387807	Emergency Mayhem on Wii.
3388808	3390610	Hard to Be a God on PC.
3391090	3392852	I think I'm going to need to get that game, okay?
3394091	3412716	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC UEFA Euro 2008 on PC Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 and PS2 and PSP and WonderSwan Color and Neo Geo Pocket Color and the Neo Geo CD those last four are probably not true
3414096	3416058	8-Ball All-Stars on DS.
3416658	3419260	We have Namco Museum Remix on Wii.
3419700	3420401	I need to get that.
3421321	3423362	The World Ends With You on DS.
3424123	3425564	That's a lot of pressure, isn't it?
3425964	3428025	That sounds like something you'd say before you kill someone.
3428446	3431047	No, that sounds like a Bond movie.
3431728	3432248	Oh, it does.
3432308	3433469	It does sound like a Bond movie.
3434430	3437371	And the very last is Time Crisis 4 on PlayStation 3.
3437412	3441114	Yeah, Time Crisis.
3442754	3447357	In the US, it's an okay release week, I should say.
3448517	3457182	Starting off, we've got Major League Baseball 2K8 Fantasy All-Stars for the DS.
3457443	3460524	It's kind of an arcade-style version of that game.
3461425	3464146	Sherlock Holmes Nemesis on the PC.
3465947	3468229	AMF Bowling Pinbusters on the DS.
3469480	3478212	Rondo of Swords on the DS Okami on the Wii Jack Keane on the PC
3479620	3482661	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue on the PS3.
3482761	3485362	That's just a small old game there.
3486622	3489463	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC.
3489803	3498326	Also on PC this week, Turok and Europa Universalist Rome.
3498786	3499607	That's kind of a weird name.
3501387	3503928	High School Musical 2 worked this out on the DS.
3504308	3506089	Also another Disney DS game.
3506109	3507249	What if I don't want to work it out?
3508101	3509322	Then you don't buy the game.
3509402	3510063	Alright, I won't.
3510523	3513406	Another Disney DS game, Cory in the House.
3515147	3520111	The Sims 2 Kitchen and Bath Interior Design Stuff expansion for the PC.
3520412	3521172	Oh, yay!
3522613	3525316	Summer Sports Paradise Island for the Wii.
3525916	3530100	Also being brought out by Destineer, which has crappy games.
3531501	3535364	Teenage Zombies Invasion of the Alien Brain thingies for the DS.
3536645	3540446	Emergency Mayhem for the Wii, which is supposed to be just like Crazy Taxi.
3541406	3547848	And as Rob mentioned earlier, the Final Fantasy XI Vanadil Collection 2008 for the PC.
3549568	3551048	We have other releases.
3551148	3552929	Do you want to get into that kind of crack?
3553609	3555469	What about the Virtual Console?
3555829	3557910	Well, these, of course, have already come out now.
3558190	3560491	These are for our UK releases for Virtual Console.
3560831	3561691	It's Yoshi's Cookie!
3563061	3567187	Which is 500 Wii Points, the equivalent of 5 Euro or 3 pounds 50.
3568849	3570972	And it's Yoshi's Cookie.
3571012	3573055	What more do I need to say about freaking Yoshi's Cookie?
3573475	3575458	That it was far superior on the Super Nintendo.
3575498	3577521	So why they released the Nintendo version, I have no idea.
3577741	3578702	Now the next one.
3579983	3583025	We need triumphant music for this, for these next two.
3583085	3583625	Hold on, hold on.
3583925	3586167	I do have fanfare music somewhere.
3586587	3587507	It'll just take me a minute.
3587547	3589468	Can you read a different one before you get to those two?
3589488	3591349	Well, the next two are, these are the only two left.
3592410	3593030	Actually, are they?
3594311	3595011	No, there's more.
3595151	3597072	I will skip ahead and then I will go back to the awesome ones.
3597092	3599153	Alright, good, because I'm getting the fanfare right now.
3599974	3602395	California Games, which is Commodore 64.
3602915	3606277	Ooh, Commodore 64 games are hitting the Wii finally.
3606537	3607738	And Impossible Mission.
3610249	3612370	That's the one I should have played the fanfare for.
3612691	3619354	Both of them are 500 Wii points, 3 pounds 50 pence, or a 5 euro.
3620715	3623357	But those aren't the two that... Stay a while.
3623377	3625958	Stay forever.
3626839	3628120	Did you ever play Impossible Mission?
3629881	3631482	I didn't have a Commodore 64, Rob.
3631582	3631862	Really?
3632242	3632822	I told you I didn't.
3632842	3633403	That's right.
3633443	3634263	You know what I had?
3634303	3636805	I had the Texas Instruments stupid retardo computer.
3638025	3638966	And I had a Clico Atom.
3640970	3642371	I'm still trying to find the sounds.
3642951	3643272	Darn it.
3643292	3644352	Well, then I will go ahead.
3644632	3646994	Because I will go ahead and announce the one that semi gets fanfare.
3647154	3647795	Oh, you know why?
3647975	3649115	Because here's the thing.
3649155	3652157	I had to upgrade Winamp to get Shoutcast now.
3652518	3655520	And for whatever reason, my Winamp is not playing WAV files.
3655740	3656600	Although you think it would.
3657041	3657801	The old one did.
3658582	3659762	I just haven't configured it right.
3659822	3661503	So we have no sounds tonight.
3661684	3662004	Okay.
3662224	3663845	We'll have Loki sing a fanfare.
3664405	3664786	Wait, hold on.
3664826	3665666	Loki, sing the fanfare.
3665786	3666687	I'm not singing the fanfare.
3666707	3667207	Sing the fanfare.
3667547	3668228	No fanfare.
3668288	3668628	Please.
3668748	3669749	Use the NBC music.
3670956	3671176	No.
3671717	3672658	You can't use it, can you?
3672678	3673219	Just read it.
3673279	3674920	We're wasting so much time.
3674961	3676002	Precious time.
3676042	3679085	Alright, Wonder Boy from the Sega Master System.
3679105	3680086	500 Wii Points.
3680527	3684491	And that game is really sweet, but this is the one that makes me super uber happy.
3685192	3686153	Fantasy Zone!
3686794	3688155	Didn't we announce this last week?
3688195	3688616	Yay!
3690332	3694496	I think we announced it was coming, but it wasn't really known when it was coming.
3695076	3700521	It's out now, you're the Opa Opa, and you get to shoot stuff, and it sort of plays like Defender, but it's awesome.
3701302	3705126	Fantasy Zone is my second favorite game ever.
3706405	3708567	and was one of the classic games of the week as well.
3708587	3710689	It was the first classic game of the week.
3712070	3718216	By the way, in the US on the Virtual Console you also get Yoshi's Cookie and Bases Loaded came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
3718236	3722580	Speaking of baseball games, if you want to play one of the classics, Bases Loaded will set you back 500 Wii Points.
3725143	3726384	Now we'll go back to some gaming news.
3728505	3731026	And, uh, I don't know.
3731066	3733107	This isn't exactly like totally gaming news.
3733127	3734928	This is basically what idiots think.
3734948	3735829	I don't know.
3735849	3737870	Maybe this should be a new segment on our show.
3737950	3738750	What idiots think.
3738850	3739210	I don't know.
3739910	3740671	Here's the deal.
3741511	3744333	There's this website and it's called whattheyplay.com.
3745553	3751277	It's a parental-oriented website, and they did a poll a little earlier this week.
3752718	3759123	What they did in this poll is that they surveyed, what would you find most offensive in a video game?
3759963	3760784	Here's the results.
3761565	3770391	The choices were a graphically severed human head, a man and a woman having sex, multiple use of the F word, and two men kissing.
3772048	3772608	Here's the thing.
3772988	3777449	The least offensive, according to the poll, is multiple usages of the F word, 10%.
3777509	3784271	The second least offensive, a graphically severed human head with 26%.
3784311	3785011	And then, two men kissing, 27%.
3795242	3802980	So two men kissing is right in the same ballpark as a graphically severed human head in how offensive they are in a video game.
3805220	3806221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3831607	3832787	It's been that way forever.
3833448	3844731	I have to say that we are probably one of the most... I'd have to say conflicting societies as far as... Because, you know, sex sells everything.
3844951	3848833	And everything, you know, the porn industry is thriving.
3848853	3849313	There's all this.
3849613	3852314	Yet we have this other extreme like, oh, but we don't talk about that.
3852854	3853674	Oh, we don't do this.
3853814	3854955	Oh, we don't have this in our game.
3855015	3855895	Oh, this is offensive.
3856915	3858656	People just need to get over it.
3860012	3865979	Siren says in our chat room, Siren, I keep mispronouncing it, says, what did the two men look like?
3866100	3870946	I guess that is important because if they're like two guys who haven't bathed in a week, that would be kind of offensive, I think.
3871656	3872977	I don't think the kissing would be offensive.
3872997	3875278	I would just think that the lack of personal hygiene would be offensive.
3875298	3876258	See if that's the point.
3876578	3888943	So where does, like, say, I don't know, two men kissing a graphically severed human head on top of a man and woman having sex while they shout obscenities, where does that fall on the list?
3889123	3890244	Is this your next dream game?
3890504	3891745	WhatTheyPlay.com The Game
3910564	3912166	It's whattheyplay.com, the game.
3912526	3917472	And what it is is it stars three people, two guys and a girl.
3918153	3920516	And all they do is they know how to say the F word.
3920556	3921717	So we get the 10% there.
3922258	3925161	And meanwhile, the two guys will kiss.
3925621	3928645	And then the man and the woman will have sex while they sever the other guy's head.
3929246	3929886	I'm not sure what...
3933385	3938169	I'm not sure where the game is in this, but we'll find it somewhere.
3938189	3938889	To take pictures.
3939710	3942172	Yeah, like Pokemon Snap.
3942812	3943413	Okay, there it is.
3944453	3947296	And the more offensive the photo is...
3948564	3954107	The more gee the photo is, then that's beautiful, Rob.
3954267	3954787	I love this idea.
3954827	3956048	I love your sick imagination.
3956068	3958909	It's What They Play Snap.
3958990	3960250	Okay, I want to change the name.
3960370	3961811	Okay, so an OLR dream game.
3961831	3962111	Here it is.
3962531	3964412	What They Play Snap.
3964492	3965493	Add this to our wiki.
3965793	3965953	Yes.
3966814	3968074	We need a dream games wiki.
3968715	3968995	There is.
3969235	3969895	The dream games wiki.
3969915	3970235	There is?
3970315	3970496	Yes.
3970736	3971176	Okay, cool.
3971356	3973957	There's already a wiki page on there, so we'll need to get this added.
3974618	3975738	What They Play Snap.
3975838	3976919	And in What They Play Snap...
3977319	3986065	is three people that use the F word, then half kiss each other, then half sex with each other, then kill each other while you take pictures on a track.
3989607	3995471	And then in later stages, in later stages, you get the pester ball.
3998233	3999734	Because no one likes a pester ball.
4003499	4004740	We seriously have problems.
4004900	4006080	Rob is red in the face.
4006280	4007441	I don't think it's from the heat.
4007661	4009421	He's just so excited about the idea.
4009441	4012043	I don't know, because I find this immature shit funny.
4012163	4017165	Okay, let's go back to the root problem, though, here, is this survey.
4017265	4019846	Obviously, we're being a little bit facetious with this whole stuff here.
4020946	4021747	The problem is... I'm not.
4021767	4022287	I want the game.
4024369	4024949	Quick poll.
4025469	4028131	We need to do an Insta poll right now in Orange Lounge.
4028391	4029692	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4029712	4031373	I want to see some Y's or N's.
4031974	4033935	Would you buy what they play Snap?
4034676	4035716	Y or N. Would you play it?
4036157	4037337	Let's say the game costs $29.99.
4038498	4039539	Would you buy it?
4040059	4041480	And it's on Nintendo Wii.
4043622	4044322	Would you buy it?
4045103	4045523	Y or N?
4045863	4047424	I think that's what makes that the most...
4049661	4058990	Act now, we'll throw in a severed head controller cover for your severed head attachment.
4059530	4061532	It'll be a severed head camera.
4062073	4065156	Somebody in chat said something about this and I thought it was really good.
4066457	4069099	I think it was RawSteelUT had said something and I lost it here.
4069139	4069499	Oh, here it is.
4070580	4073102	Seriously, this isn't exactly a scientific poll.
4073162	4075423	You'd get different results on game facts.
4076144	4081568	And it does have to do with the audience that was sampled because it was more of a conservative audience.
4081948	4086191	But still, I mean, doesn't that kind of say something about just society in general?
4086231	4088172	I mean, maybe this goes beyond gaming a little bit.
4088232	4089413	Pardon us for getting so deep.
4089433	4090614	But seriously, guys...
4090834	4091515	and DarkSakura.com.
4120061	4120602	I don't know.
4120902	4123263	Me personally, I cannot watch the Saw movies.
4123864	4125045	That level of violence.
4125065	4126886	I watched the first one and I was like, that's enough.
4126926	4128187	I've heard about what's in the other ones.
4128347	4129067	I don't need to see it.
4129748	4131689	If you want to watch it, have fun.
4131769	4133830	You want to see that sick shit, go for it.
4133890	4136192	But for me, I don't want to watch that.
4136232	4138754	There's other things I could watch with my time, like Showgirls.
4139674	4140715	Showgirls is great.
4140795	4143337	And for the record, I've never seen a Saw movie and never will.

4180872	4182754	Here are the results of our quick poll.
4182814	4184855	Would you buy our game on the Nintendo Wii?
4185656	4190699	Y, Y, Y, N. Throw the pester ball at the people having sex and they look up at you and say, fuck.
4191600	4199886	Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y. I'd buy it for my whole Sunday school class.
4201046	4202527	I'd buy a Nintendo Wii for it.
4203328	4209713	Y, N, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y in a fucking instant, N, Y.
4210373	4210753	There you have it.
4210773	4213995	The results of the OLR Quick Poll.
4214476	4216056	Interesting comment as well from Odd1.
4216377	4218918	Torture porn is just what the name says.
4219378	4221520	I'll leave it, but nothing against those who watch it.
4221620	4221900	Why?
4221960	4227784	Because I don't bloody think that one piece of media is going to completely change a person and destroy whatever moral fiber they might have.
4227824	4230205	And Drew Nami says, case in point, Ichi the Killer.
4231206	4233507	There's a lot of sick shit out there in movies.
4234087	4235828	If you want to watch it, go for it.
4236249	4239611	But, you know, on the other hand, if people want to watch...
4240948	4245871	If people want to play a game that might involve a sexual component, whatever, right?
4245931	4247252	That's what warnings are for.
4247432	4247792	Hi.
4248013	4248453	Exactly.
4248473	4249453	It's what reviews are for.
4249514	4249854	Hi.
4250074	4251034	Read them, you know.
4251795	4252716	Be educated.
4253376	4255437	Be a little educated when it comes to purchasing your games?
4256418	4257058	You know what?
4257379	4261141	People should just be educated in general and not so freaking head up their ass.
4263002	4263582	That's what I think.
4264523	4265644	Get your head out of your ass.
4267023	4267603	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4296711	4296953	Okay.
4297599	4298043	Legos!
4299691	4301732	Legos aren't really games, but they do make Lego games.
4303533	4306815	I think the Lego Star Wars games are tons of fun.
4306895	4313598	Now there is going to be, by Activision, a Lego Indiana Jones game that's going to be out on the 6th of June.
4314879	4323983	You can actually play as over 60 characters and some of his friends and some of the enemies.
4324203	4328846	You can actually customize your characters by mixing out their parts.
4329946	4331367	You know, like when you play with Legos.
4332808	4333909	And you have your whip.
4334670	4338352	From what I'm seeing, using the whip is sort of like...
4341024	4341465	Pitfall.
4342426	4352156	Because they're saying that you use it to get over gaps and hit switches and you can use it to pick up items in the game to throw at people.
4354138	4362547	And then you can interact with your environment and you swim and climb and jumping, climbing trees, that type of stuff.
4363343	4364123	Thanks for watching!
4387360	4391204	It's also coming out in the US and released in North America in June as well.
4391484	4393125	So around the same time as the movie.
4394066	4394326	Awesome.
4395827	4402693	There's going to be an update coming, well we've been talking about it for a while now, Codename Bogart, which is coming to Burnout Paradise.
4402753	4415584	It's going to be basically the next update that they have, hopefully adding this brand new island to race in and going to be part of many different updates that they're going to have for the game.
4416684	4421187	Some of the things that are going to be coming with it, including some bug fixes.
4422367	4431792	They're going to be identifying the top 10 problems that users have been facing, online functionality, balancing tweaks.
4432492	4438135	They're going to be fixing the head-on takedowns, which seemed unfair, I guess, and unrealistic.
4438895	4441997	Unfair low-speed takedowns have been removed.
4443017	4465759	and then they're going to also be of course adding you know the brand new tracks and or portions of the game and hopefully some new cars to download all this is supposed to happen April 24th so I guess a lot to happen in a day yeah and so I guess we'll have to uh stay tuned to see what that is I'm interested in it I'm actually gonna start playing the game again once it comes out but uh
4466500	4467061	Only briefly.
4468342	4470724	Burnout Paradise kind of wore out quick.
4470784	4472526	I don't think I like the open world thing.
4472566	4474268	I think I like my Burnout the way it was.
4474288	4475529	I don't like what they did to it.
4475629	4476490	I like the open world.
4476570	4480614	I'm being so hypocritical because I loved it in test drive.
4480755	4481395	Maybe that's why.
4482256	4484378	When I played Burnout, I was like, I've played this before.
4484398	4485139	It's a lot of grinding.
4485259	4494087	is what it is, because it's a lot of like, okay, you finished this many races, now you have to do it all over again to get this next license, now you gotta do it all over again.
4494407	4502895	Whereas like the crash modes and stuff like that of the older games, they provided different scenarios and stuff to play through, whereas this game
4503235	4513361	You can kind of crash anywhere, but there's only really specific spots that you're going to kind of want to go to where you can get enough points to get to the next license.
4513801	4516883	Well, Burnout Paradise is not the only game that's getting a patch this week.
4517423	4519964	Lair is also going to be getting a patch very soon.
4520705	4522946	It's coming out in Japan on April 17th.
4522966	4525647	That's probably the same day you're likely to see it everywhere else.
4526348	4532371	The biggest thing that you're getting in this patch, not just Rumble support for the new Rumble controllers coming out, the DualShock 3s, but...
4533031	4537414	Now you're going to get analog controls, finally.
4537875	4542458	You don't have to just control with the 6-axis controller.
4542538	4550464	There will be a new targeting icon that shows up, and now you can download Wind Dragon and Poison Dragon, the different types of dragons that you can use in any old stage.
4550804	4555327	I wonder if this will change people's opinions on the game, because some of the people's biggest bitch they had was the controls.
4555407	4559630	Yeah, if they fixed the controls, I'd be really interested to see how the game plays out.
4559850	4564453	I want to see some people, just some, not everybody, but some people that reviewed this game before, like re-review it.
4564954	4565514	If that makes sense.
4565754	4566755	They may, actually.
4567436	4568356	I'd be curious to see that.
4568756	4572479	Which is very interesting if a patch has that big of an impact on a game.
4572599	4573080	You know what I mean?
4573660	4576882	Well, I'll teach them to stick with the stupid motion controls.
4578043	4580185	Only, you know, they should have it as an option.
4581145	4581706	Just like Rumble.
4582967	4583147	True.
4583167	4583307	True.
4585239	4610713	Well, some good news for our friends over in the UK is that one of the retailers, Shop2, has confirmed that they are going to be selling a Grand Theft Auto 4 hardware bundle that will have the 40 gig PS3, 6-axis, and a copy of GTA 4, and it will be out on the 29th of April for £299, which is the equivalent of $590 for us.
4614998	4615278	Nice.
4616218	4618279	Any word on something like that coming over here?
4619139	4620159	Not that I've seen.
4621300	4622920	I don't work in the industry.
4623240	4624760	Are you surprised, Loki, at the lack?
4624800	4629141	I mean, I know you're big on Grand Theft Auto 4 and this is supposed to be like a system-selling type game.
4629522	4638464	I have actually heard people thinking of investing in a PlayStation 3 because they want to get Grand Theft Auto and for whatever reason there's more games on the PS3 that interest them as opposed to Xbox 360.
4639024	4641184	Why isn't Sony jumping on the opportunity over here?
4641945	4642505	I don't know.
4642545	4643165	Probably because...
4643925	4644265	and DarkSakura.
4664033	4669196	Really though, they've been having trouble keeping the systems in, I think.
4669836	4671817	Although we haven't been selling them too fast, I know.
4674038	4678120	I went to Fry's the other day and they had pallets of PS3s just sitting there.
4679921	4681522	It's not like there's a shortage of them.
4681582	4684405	It's just people need games to play on it.
4684865	4687487	I guess Grand Theft Auto will be one of those games.
4687527	4687948	It'll be one.
4687988	4699297	They'll sell systems, but at the same time, I think if people actually realize, hey, there's a lot of games on 360 as well, and it's coming out on there, but
4700356	4701397	To each his own, I guess.
4701757	4702778	Whatever their preference is.
4704599	4711743	So one thing, though, that's kind of disappointing is the PlayStation Network will be going down tomorrow for about 15 hours.
4713124	4720528	But not a big deal, because it will be coming back shortly after that with the brand new PlayStation Store.
4721009	4722710	It's going to be completely redesigned.
4723070	4725592	It's going to have a bunch of new features in there as well.
4726172	4728994	It's supposed to be a little bit easier to browse, kind of like the...
4730168	4753185	I don't know, SingStar store a little bit and some of the cool things that they're going to have on there as well hopefully the home beta will be coming out pretty soon but lots of stuff to look forward to and it's nice to see that they're actually updating their store because it was pretty hard to browse through and this looks a little bit better
4755239	4761689	Yeah, I think the PlayStation Store kind of needed some look and feel changes to it, so I hope this goes well for them.
4761909	4764293	You know what other store needs look and changes?
4764553	4769421	That fucking virtual console store needs some serious updates.
4771161	4777463	Well, going from hardcore updates and news to big old rumors, take this with a big grain of salt.
4778204	4781025	Apparently, this is coming over from Game Reactor.
4782345	4791209	Some blogger on there has said that apparently John Woo is going to announce the Metroid film at next week's Comic-Con in New York City.
4792049	4793190	Here's the deal with it.
4793310	4798912	It's going to star Christiana Loken, and she was the main actress in Blood Rain, apparently.
4799492	4800553	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4822249	4846504	but he did and he's gotten involved with video games before because there was Stranglehold right was a John Woo game as well so kind of interesting I think the release date makes this false because I think if this were true the movie would already be filming and I don't know that seems like a pretty aggressive release date to just like unless they're gonna like start filming it this summer I guess they could the release date can change I mean it's just go ahead
4848225	4857010	Also keep in mind that a lot of times, especially for projects that they're going to hype quite a bit and want to actually push out there, that they'll start filming them under a false name.
4858230	4865694	But still, just with the amount of buzz that a game like this would get, I would think that something would leak.
4865934	4866374	You know what I mean?
4867655	4867935	I don't know.
4869256	4869536	I don't know.
4869777	4872239	If they're doing it all on a soundstage, who knows?
4872319	4883287	Also, all the work that they could be doing right now, could it be maybe going in reverse a little bit, doing a lot of the CG work now, and then going back and then filming the stuff and then adding the CG stuff in there?
4884068	4884388	I don't know.
4885649	4886430	There's modeling.
4887083	4891865	I would just think the special effects that a Metroid movie would take are going to take too long unless they've already been doing them.
4891885	4896666	But again, if they've already been doing them, some dude on a blog somewhere would not have been the first one to notice this.
4897086	4899007	Or it's going to really suck.
4900407	4901247	That would be sad.
4901988	4902848	That would be very sad.
4903866	4904746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4924773	4929715	DarkSakura likes to dig through her collection every week and find one game to spotlight for those of you guys pay a little respect to the classic video game of the week
4951823	4955165	So DarkSakura, what classic video game have you selected for the crowd this week?
4955405	4958987	This is another one that makes my heart hurt that it's considered a classic now.
4960067	4963289	But it came out on PlayStation and it's Bust a Move.
4963789	4965470	I'm not talking about Puzzle Bobble.
4966630	4974694	It came out over here as Bust a Groove because Puzzle Bobble came out as Bust a Move already and therefore had the license in the U.S.
4975695	4977095	But in Japan it was Bust a Move.
4977396	4978016	Let's take a listen.
4993331	4995432	Whoever's playing as Kitty Yen is actually doing pretty good.
4995653	5001256	And the video file that we are playing this from is actually the person playing on the mode with no commands.
5001276	5003138	I don't know if you noticed that, Rob.
5003298	5003878	Yeah, I noticed.
5003938	5005840	I was like, something's wrong with this when I was looking at it.
5005860	5007701	There's no arrows that you hit in.
5007981	5011784	Yeah, that's actually when I was at my height of playing this game, I used to play it without commands.
5012664	5014465	Because everyone has the same damn moves?
5014746	5017748	You're probably going to have to explain for our listeners how this is different from DDR.
5018590	5039685	Okay, basically what Bust a Move is, it's sort of a versus dance game where you put in the commands that it brings up on the screen and you do them, you hit your trigger button, I guess I usually call it the trigger, whatever your last command button is, to activate those moves right on the beat.
5040286	5044289	So you have to have good rhythm to make sure that you're hitting this right.
5045029	5047051	And some of the songs go from...
5047911	5051974	Super easy to super hard to just being easy and then having tricky parts.
5052614	5053815	Like this one.
5054676	5058399	In fact, at the very end of this part is where the trickiest part of the song for me is.
5061521	5073369	And as you might have just heard where it says high-scoring moves, you actually have secret moves that when it comes up to the character's solo part, if you know what that command is, then you can put in those moves and it boosts your score even more.
5073389	5073429	Um...
5075651	5077532	It has a bunch of different characters.
5077552	5078733	It had different songs each.
5078773	5081235	You had different styles.
5081275	5083897	They actually changed quite a bit, though, when the US version came out.
5083937	5089401	You had Frida, Gasso, Ham, who was the hamburger guy.
5089421	5090022	I thought he was great.
5090362	5093204	Heat, Hiro, who was the disco guy.
5093604	5095646	Kelly, who was a fetishist.
5096066	5096987	She was a slut, basically.
5098374	5101915	Kitty N, Kitty Nakajima Pinky, Stripper Shorty, Strike Burger Dog
5119841	5132506	Dance Moves, who's in Ham Stage, Capoeira, which were two silver aliens that did Capoeira-style dancing, Columbo, that was Shorty's pet mouse, and Robo-Z, who was actually the boss of the game.
5133266	5139489	And when you fight Robo-Z, Robo-Z's like really freaking tall, and you're like maybe the size of a finger.
5140962	5145947	And you're actually on top of a building and it's in the middle of the street causing accidents and wrecks.
5146187	5148029	Hey, it's Capoeira.
5148990	5154836	But Capoeira was also called Kiki and Lala, which I thought was pretty funny.
5155677	5160201	So when the game came out in the US, they... See, this is the good version, if we can turn it up a little bit.
5167103	5170146	Okay, this is, they made this song in English and it sucked.
5170206	5173329	The woman could not sing for crap.
5173509	5176232	They actually did, they edited it quite a bit.
5176272	5178794	Like, when Strike comes out, he would drink from a flask.
5179835	5183178	And they changed it to a can of Coke.
5183198	5184540	They took out Hero's Cigarette.
5184580	5188604	They changed certain lyrics for being, I guess, racially charged.
5188664	5191426	And also references to McDonald's and Burger King.
5192607	5197974	Um, they, like I said, they did some of the songs in English, which just was awful.
5198114	5198574	Oh my god.
5198594	5200817	They left Fridas in Japanese, which I don't understand.
5201458	5203961	Um, and then, um...
5206685	5220050	Also, with the stages, though, is that if you did a seven-point combo, which, you know, that was getting up to the most difficult stage of doing those special combos, you could get the levels to do, like, neat stuff.
5220090	5226093	Like, for this stage here, Capoeira stage, the doors would pop off, and you'd either be in the air or you'd be in outer space, depending.
5228173	5231835	If you play shorty and pull one off, her mouse jumps out of her pocket and starts dancing with her.
5232955	5239840	This game is so... It's just really one of my... Okay, I first played this when someone brought over their copy.
5240380	5242041	It had only been like a week in Japan.
5242882	5245864	And I imported it as soon as Payday hit.
5247085	5252809	I know this bugs you when I call it this, but Bust a Move 2 was my first rhythm game ever here in the U.S.
5253429	5257572	And without that game, I probably would not be here on Orange Lounge Radio today.
5257732	5260174	So I totally love this series as well.
5260942	5282393	Best of Move 2 and the reason why I'm not really combining them is because actually Best of Move 2 to me is sort of a different game because each character had their own set of special commands instead of having everyone having the same move which is why you can play Best of Move in
5284918	5287339	without the commands because everybody had the same damn commands.
5287819	5291580	And I actually had one of the first English fan sites on this game and it's gone.
5291680	5300263	It's been dead, but the link is still on the anime web turnpike if that's any indication of how long I've had that site.
5300463	5301183	Fever time.
5301343	5301603	Yeah.
5301943	5304304	When a new character does really well, they get to bust out a solo.
5304324	5304924	It's pretty awesome.
5305524	5306565	And the endings are funny too.
5307505	5310967	But Busted Move 2 had individual moves for everybody.
5310987	5315910	It had easy mode, which it was all just using commands with the arrows.
5316330	5319973	You had the medium mode, which plays pretty much just like the first Busted Move.
5319993	5323675	And then you had mix mode, which uses the triangle score and everything.
5323695	5328838	And you also had attacks too, which if you timed your attack just right, you could completely botch their entire solo.
5329978	5334560	Now, really quickly here, before we go to break, because we've got to kind of wrap this segment up, why do you think this series kind of died off?
5334640	5339061	Because, you know, we had these games, we had Dance Summit, which was kind of meh.
5339402	5340722	I love Dance Summit!
5340782	5342683	It's just, it wasn't really the same.
5343063	5348745	Why did this series, why haven't we seen more games in this series, especially with how popular music games have been in this day and age?
5349249	5350190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5367611	5368211	Thank you for watching!
5388944	5395966	They really tried to innovate the series, and I thought that Buster Move 2 was going in the right direction, but they haven't done anything else with it.
5396006	5402909	I think that maybe because of how poorly Dance Summit did, that maybe they thought that it was just time to end the series.
5403009	5403509	I don't know.
5403649	5403989	Sad.
5404449	5409511	But what they need to do is go back and do another one that plays like Buster Move 2.
5411400	5414829	Alright, we gotta wrap up, but that is your classic game of the week, folks.
5414909	5416232	It is Bust a Move.
5416292	5419039	How can you not like a game that has a gigantic voguing robot?
5419485	5420166	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5441823	5442544	I guess that is true.
5443226	5446492	Real quickly, Qualtipo in chat asked, what could they put in a Buster Groove sequel?
5447274	5450480	Honestly, just more of the same on next gen.
5450540	5451742	Online, Xbox Live.
5451783	5453626	Get rid of bio, bring back gaso.
5454982	5458384	Here's a great Xbox... What a great Xbox Live Arcade game this might make.
5458404	5459204	See, that would be good.
5459285	5460785	And you know what they should have, I think?
5461446	5470570	They should have... You know, you can do creative mode... You know, in wrestling games, you can do create a wrestler and customize all of their moves, every single one based on what you put.
5470691	5478495	All you have to do is have a creative dancer mode and you'd give them different combo moves or give them a style of dance and...
5479175	5479395	All right.
5488464	5489704	I think that that should come out.
5490324	5491225	Another dream game!
5513837	5517159	All right, we are going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5517619	5520981	We're going to do a quick break, and we're going to come back with Part B of our podcast.
