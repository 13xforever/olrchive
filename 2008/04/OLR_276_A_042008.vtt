00:00.000 --> 00:19.360
Tonight, April 20th, 2008, Rock Band is set to get its first full albums, Soul Caliber

00:19.360 --> 00:24.240
the Original is headed to Xbox Live Arcade, and did a recent video game release borrow

00:24.240 --> 00:31.600
its box art from the internet.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.480
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.480 --> 00:36.480
Radio.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.840
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

00:40.840 --> 00:42.600
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.160
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,

00:47.160 --> 00:48.160
Jamie Summers.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.160
Hi.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.160
And how are you, Jamie?

00:50.160 --> 00:51.480
I'm a little tired.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.800
I'm sorry to hear about the tiredness.

00:53.800 --> 00:58.040
I can tell you're quiet and you seem like your energy is depleted a little bit.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.360
Well, a happy late birthday to you, Ms. Jamie Summers.

01:01.360 --> 01:05.680
I know this weekend was your birthday and I guess you're just too exhausted from all

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
the partying, huh?

01:06.680 --> 01:13.800
I went to San Francisco for Sakura Matsuri and I was very sad because it was so windy

01:13.800 --> 01:17.000
that all the blossoms had been blown off of the trees except for a few.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh no.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.040
But I did a lot of shopping and they changed Kinokuniya.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.040
Hmm.

01:24.040 --> 01:28.720
It has a whole anime manga stuff section downstairs.

01:28.720 --> 01:29.720
Interesting.

01:29.720 --> 01:35.720
But that's where all the fanboys were but that's also where all the Copic markers and

01:35.720 --> 01:37.680
the leader pads were so I had to go down there.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.840
I noticed you brought back a video game magazine, All in Japanese.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
It looks like Famitsu magazine.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.760
I brought back last month's issue of Famitsu.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.760
Nice.

01:43.760 --> 01:48.760
And I brought back the first issue of the Blue Dragon manga which is interesting.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.120
Yeah, I was thumbing through it and I'm like, this looks to have nothing in common with

01:52.120 --> 01:53.120
the video games.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.240
It's not done by Toriyama.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.480
Interesting.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.600
And I brought back a bunch of comics.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.600
Cool, cool.

02:00.600 --> 02:03.880
We noticed you're getting a lot of belated happy birthdays in our chat room.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.760
Thank you everybody else in the chat room.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.640
And if you want to join us, chat.orangelaungeradio.com is the place to be even though we do tape

02:09.640 --> 02:15.220
live on all games radio, we do use a separate chat room still, our old chat room, so chat.orangelaungeradio.com

02:15.220 --> 02:18.200
or if you're already on the game search network, it's channel Orange Lounge.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.600
And I got pie today but I haven't eaten any of it.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.960
Birthday pie instead of birthday cake?

02:21.960 --> 02:25.120
Because my boss baked me a cake on Friday.

02:25.120 --> 02:30.160
Well, not on Friday, but she brought me homemade carrot cake because carrot cake is my favorite

02:30.160 --> 02:31.160
cake.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.160
Nice.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.160
She baked me a cake.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.160
I'm so happy.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.400
That's even better than giving you a cookie is baking you a cake.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.400
I got pie today.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.400
Nice.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.400
What kind of pie?

02:40.400 --> 02:41.400
I did eat a lot of cookies though.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.400
I had Samoas.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
I love Samoas.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
I ate them.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.240
They were cold too and had Mars Bars eggs and Nestle Black Magic eggs.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.240
Oh, you got to stop talking.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.640
I miss all these foods ever since I had to go on the low fat diet thanks to the pancreas.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.640
Pie is good for you.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.640
All right.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.640
Let's move on.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.640
It's full of vitamin banana.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.560
Let's move over and say hello to Tech Master Loki who also joins us every week.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.560
Hello.

03:01.560 --> 03:02.560
You're on Orange Lounge.

03:02.560 --> 03:03.560
How are you?

03:03.560 --> 03:04.560
I'm doing good.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.560
Any cookies or pie in your day?

03:05.560 --> 03:06.560
No.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.560
Do you have an exciting weekend?

03:07.560 --> 03:08.560
Do anything fun?

03:08.560 --> 03:14.400
I waited two hours to eat at Joe's Crab Shack yesterday, I guess.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.400
No, that's not fun.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.400
Two hours?

03:16.400 --> 03:17.400
Two hours.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.880
That must have been some damn good seafood.

03:18.880 --> 03:19.880
No.

03:19.880 --> 03:20.880
It was.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.360
We were damn patient.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.200
It's really popular here, though, in Sacramento, though, because it's on the river.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.200
You went to look downtown.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.200
It was on the river, right?

03:27.200 --> 03:28.200
It was Saturday night.

03:28.200 --> 03:33.540
It was during dinner rush and they had prom people there, so, you know, people are dumb.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.480
I was out of town for four days.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.800
I missed Jamie's birthday, sadly.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.800
I was completely out of town since Thursday.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.880
I did my yearly pilgrimage out to the middle of nowhere, also known as Mendocino, which

03:43.880 --> 03:47.120
is up on the north coast of California.

03:47.120 --> 03:51.560
Part of it's a vacation from, you know, life, but it's also a vacation from the internets

03:51.560 --> 03:54.880
and everything because there's no phone connection out there.

03:54.880 --> 03:55.880
There's no internet.

03:55.880 --> 03:56.880
There's no nothing.

03:56.880 --> 03:57.880
Just the beach, hot tub.

03:57.880 --> 04:02.440
Good times, except for the food poisoning I got that kept me in bed all day Saturday.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.440
That kind of sucked.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.600
Oh, well.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.540
I did end up playing some video games, so I'll talk about that in a minute right after

04:07.540 --> 04:09.320
we get to Dark Sakura's gaming week.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.680
How was your gaming week?

04:11.680 --> 04:12.680
It wasn't.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.760
Well, other than Ragnarok, but I bought Famitsu and the Blue Dragon manga.

04:16.760 --> 04:23.640
And we were supposed to hook up the Dreamcast.

04:23.640 --> 04:27.320
We had talked about hooking up the Dreamcast so that I could play a couple of things that

04:27.320 --> 04:32.240
I've been sort of having an itch to, but instead I downloaded ZSNES today.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.240
The emulator.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.240
Nice.

04:34.240 --> 04:38.240
Because I want to finish Seiken Densetsu 3, and I think I know where my save file is.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.960
It was at the Super Nintendo ROM you were most itching to finish?

04:40.960 --> 04:43.560
Yeah, it was a pretty good RPG.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.720
Those are good times.

04:46.720 --> 04:52.320
If you want to join our chat room and give comments on gaming weeks, chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com,

04:52.320 --> 04:55.760
and for some reason people are commenting on Joe's Crab Shack.

04:55.760 --> 05:00.720
SSJ100Matt says, you ate at the Crab Shack on Passover?

05:00.720 --> 05:02.840
Fired.

05:02.840 --> 05:08.640
Somebody who didn't change their name, OLArmyRecruit2559 says, always with the ragnacrack.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.780
Yeah, and your point is?

05:10.780 --> 05:12.240
Did you ever sign up for the number two?

05:12.240 --> 05:13.800
Solid Goomba, by the way.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.800
Oh, okay.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.880
Did you ever sign up for the number two?

05:15.880 --> 05:21.080
No, I'm going to wait until they have more than just menus translated.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.720
Did you get some of the bugs worked out from the early releases?

05:24.720 --> 05:29.440
Yeah, because I'd actually like to be able to do the quests, and I don't read Korean.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.440
Yet.

05:30.440 --> 05:39.640
Amazingly enough, know how Korean is read, you know, how the characters are arranged,

05:39.640 --> 05:42.120
but I do not actually read any Korean.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.120
Sorry.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.120
It's alright.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.120
Nobody's perfect.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.800
Alright, let's move on over to Loki.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.520
Was there any Korean in your gaming week?

05:48.520 --> 05:49.520
No.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.520
Oh, then what was there?

05:50.520 --> 05:52.040
I don't think.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.680
I played Omega 5, actually.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.560
I was downloading some Xbox Live Arcade games.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.840
I downloaded Ikaruga, but I never got the chance to play it.

06:01.840 --> 06:09.880
I did play, actually I played the demo of, what was it, I don't remember.

06:09.880 --> 06:10.880
Anyways.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.240
What was the new release this week, because I was out?

06:14.240 --> 06:16.680
Rocky and Bullwinkle, and Battlezone.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.320
Oh, that's right, the minigame thing.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.200
I wanted to check that out.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.200
I gotta catch up.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.240
I heard that it sucked, but whatever.

06:24.240 --> 06:27.880
I'm actually kind of excited there's another game out there that uses the webcam, other

06:27.880 --> 06:29.080
than Totem Ball.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.120
Totem Ball and Wouno.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.120
And the other board game assortment.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.120
Really, we shouldn't be encouraging them.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.120
Alright, fine.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.120
Whatever.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.600
So, yeah, I played Omega 5, and that was pretty cool.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.280
It's just really hard, but that's kind of shooters for you, I guess.

06:42.280 --> 06:49.000
I played lots of Mario Kart, and it's kind of, I don't know.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.080
I guess it's just like the other Mario Karts.

06:51.080 --> 06:56.640
I still really hate the fact that you can't do, you know, just four person, you know,

06:56.640 --> 07:00.280
everybody against everybody, you know, types of battles.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.260
It always has to be two on two teams, or one on three.

07:03.260 --> 07:05.120
It's just, it's stupid.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.520
It's just lazy that they don't have that in there.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.200
But racing is pretty fun, so we've been doing that.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.960
And then, more Saints Row, yes.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.440
I played multiplayer, but then I realized something.

07:17.440 --> 07:22.140
I don't know why I haven't realized it before, but I just found a code in the game that actually

07:22.140 --> 07:27.320
makes this game totally different, and a lot fun in just the weirdest way.

07:27.320 --> 07:31.200
I couldn't stop giggling, like, the entire time I was playing this.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.160
The code is the Evil Cars code, and it makes all the cars in the game try to hunt you down

07:36.160 --> 07:37.160
and kill you.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.160
Nice.

07:38.160 --> 07:43.520
And so, you'll be running around or something, all of a sudden, this car comes from nowhere,

07:43.520 --> 07:48.280
just flying through the air, just at your head, where they'll, like, be backing up towards

07:48.280 --> 07:49.280
you.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.440
And so, I made it, like, kind of a goal to, like, run from one end of the map to the next,

07:53.440 --> 07:54.440
and it's fun.

07:54.440 --> 07:58.760
And, in fact, I think I might actually do a little video for YouTube or something like

07:58.760 --> 08:01.720
that, just something funny with, you know, that whole thing in there, because it's hilarious,

08:01.720 --> 08:04.240
because you'll be hiding in, like, a little ditch or something, all of a sudden, all these

08:04.240 --> 08:07.040
cars fly over your head and stuff, trying to kill you.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.160
What's that, the plot of some movie?

08:09.160 --> 08:10.160
I don't know.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.160
Carrie?

08:11.160 --> 08:12.160
I don't know.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.160
Oh, no, not Carrie.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.160
No, you're thinking...

08:14.160 --> 08:15.160
That's, like, death proof.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.160
No, not death proof.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.160
I didn't see death proof.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.160
I know what you're thinking of.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.160
Ah, forget it.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.160
The title of the movie.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.160
But it sounds like fun.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.160
Can you do that in multiplayer?

08:22.160 --> 08:23.160
No.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.160
Well, it would be...

08:24.160 --> 08:25.160
It's people driving the cars.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.160
They'll come after you.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.600
If you take the people out of the cars, then they will stop moving.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.720
It's not like the cars drive themselves, because that would be cool, too.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.840
As I was going to say, it would be fun, like, that could be a fun multiplayer game, is,

08:33.840 --> 08:37.200
like, who can live longer being chased, stalked by the cars?

08:37.200 --> 08:40.960
So, what I've been doing, yeah, like I said, I put in, you know, the infinite ammo code,

08:40.960 --> 08:47.520
the infinite sprint, and just go crazy, just run, you know, and it's pretty hard.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.520
There's a lot of...

08:48.520 --> 08:51.800
Especially when, like, you get onto the freeway and stuff, and there's trucks coming after

08:51.800 --> 08:56.680
you, and cars are exploding because they keep running into each other.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.680
I don't know.

08:57.680 --> 08:58.680
It's pretty cool.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.920
SSJ 100 Matt and Chad is chiming in with Death Race 3000, which he wants to point out is

09:01.920 --> 09:03.160
being remade.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.960
Is that the one where you get stalked by cars?

09:04.960 --> 09:05.960
Death Race?

09:05.960 --> 09:06.960
Uh, no.

09:06.960 --> 09:07.960
That's the one that's just, like, Carmageddon.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.480
No, I know the one you're thinking about.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.640
It's a Stephen King movie.

09:11.640 --> 09:12.640
It was Carrie!

09:12.640 --> 09:13.640
It wasn't Carrie.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.640
No, Carrie was the prom king.

09:14.640 --> 09:15.640
Christine.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.640
Christine was the prom queen.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.680
Christine was the one about the Plymouth Fury.

09:20.680 --> 09:21.680
Yes.

09:21.680 --> 09:25.360
Well, there's another one I was thinking of where the cars were alive, and remember they

09:25.360 --> 09:28.120
had that big rig with the clown face on the front?

09:28.120 --> 09:29.120
It?

09:29.120 --> 09:30.120
No, that wasn't it.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.120
Forget it.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.120
Forget it.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.120
I don't remember what it's called.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.120
I'm not sure if someone in chat will know, though, but yeah, it's cool, though.

09:36.120 --> 09:40.040
The code just, you know, I guess a little bit more life for this next few weeks until

09:40.040 --> 09:41.160
Grand Theft Auto IV comes out.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.720
And you've been extending the life of Saints Row for quite some time.

09:43.720 --> 09:44.720
Oh, it's a great game.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.280
You're one of the only people I know that still just doesn't shut up about this game

09:47.280 --> 09:48.280
ever.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.280
It's a great game.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.720
I already have my Saints Row 2 preordered, so I can't wait to play that, too.

09:52.720 --> 09:57.400
And, you know, and I don't, everyone's always, you know, pro Saints Row or pro Grand Theft

09:57.400 --> 09:59.080
Auto and, you know, hating on the other ones.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.440
I don't understand why you can't like both.

10:00.440 --> 10:04.080
I love both games just equally, and they're good in different ways.

10:04.080 --> 10:09.280
I mean, Grand Theft Auto tends to be more realistic, where Saints Row is just absolutely

10:09.280 --> 10:14.000
batshit crazy with, you know, all sorts of, like, stuff that you wouldn't be able to do

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
in real life.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
It's just great.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
All right.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.640
Chad.orangelsrader.com, some comments.

10:19.640 --> 10:24.560
In response to the vision cam, vxjsonXV says Rayman's raving rabbits on the 360 use the

10:24.560 --> 10:25.560
vision cam.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.640
Unless, of course, you're talking about arcade scheduling.

10:26.640 --> 10:32.520
And Brad from Pod Culture, Maximo Overdrive was the name of the movie with the cars there.

10:32.520 --> 10:33.520
Nice work.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.520
Nice work.

10:34.520 --> 10:39.760
I was going to say about Rayman's Raving Rabbids, I was already worn out from the Wii version.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.440
I never even bothered with the 360 version, because I was already kind of...

10:42.440 --> 10:45.320
It's dirt cheap now, because that game didn't sell for crap, so...

10:45.320 --> 10:46.320
I bet.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.320
Well, aren't they making a sequel, though?

10:47.320 --> 10:49.920
They already made a sequel, Rayman's Raving Rabbids 2.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.640
They came out on the Wii last year, around the holiday.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.760
Apparently, I slept through it.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.760
Oh, well, you didn't miss much.

10:54.760 --> 10:55.760
That's what I hear.

10:55.760 --> 11:00.320
But they didn't do one for the 360, because, you know, the 360 one didn't sell at all.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.720
Frisbee wants to know, can you use the vision cam on the computer?

11:02.720 --> 11:04.400
Yes, you can, actually.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.960
There's software available on Microsoft's website, but there's no audio with it, and

11:07.960 --> 11:09.800
the quality's not great.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.800
We actually...

11:10.800 --> 11:15.320
I actually considered using it for our Justin TV feed, which is taping our show over Justin

11:15.320 --> 11:19.800
TV, but the quality's not that great.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.720
So that's why we don't use it.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.720
But it does work.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.460
It is a USB camera.

11:24.460 --> 11:27.600
My gaming week, believe it or not, even though I was out of town for four days, I did get

11:27.600 --> 11:32.520
the opportunity to play something new, because what is going into the wilderness with 10-year

11:32.520 --> 11:36.360
friends staying in a cabin and not bringing along some party video game?

11:36.360 --> 11:40.680
And I got to check out, for the first time, SingStar on the PlayStation 2.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.400
And we've talked about this game an awful lot on the show, but I've always been more

11:43.400 --> 11:44.760
of a karaoke revolution player.

11:44.760 --> 11:45.880
That's the games I've had.

11:45.880 --> 11:50.160
But we did get to check out SingStar, and the friend of ours had a variety.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.800
He had SingStar 80s, SingStar Pop, and SingStar Amped.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.520
And I guess one kind of cool thing is that you could switch back and forth between the

11:56.520 --> 11:59.920
games without having to turn the whole dang thing off and on.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.520
You just pop in another disc, and it loads the 30 songs from that disc.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.400
Each game has about 30 songs.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.400
SingStar was kind of fun.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.840
I was more impressed with it than I thought I would be.

12:08.840 --> 12:12.320
The only kind of bitches I have is that I didn't like the pitch gauging quite as much

12:12.320 --> 12:14.160
as I do in Karaoke Revolution.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.760
You can only see your pitch as you sing.

12:16.760 --> 12:21.600
You don't see it any time you're saying something in the mic like you do in Karaoke Revolution.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.960
You really kind of have to play both games to know what I'm talking about.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.320
But if you play Karaoke Revolution, any time you make a sound, that arrow shows up on the

12:27.320 --> 12:29.000
line to show you where you're at.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.880
Whereas in SingStar, you don't see it until you're already singing.

12:32.880 --> 12:37.040
But one thing I did like about SingStar is that it had pretty much all the real music

12:37.040 --> 12:40.520
videos in the background as you're playing, which is kind of cool.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.120
SingStar Pop has Aha!

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
Take On Me.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.720
So you know we had to play that just to see the video, because, I mean, how long?

12:46.720 --> 12:48.720
When was the last time you saw Aha!

12:48.720 --> 12:49.720
Take On Me, the video?

12:49.720 --> 12:51.600
I mean, it's got to be like years and years ago.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.720
Some of our listeners are probably too young to even remember this video.

12:53.720 --> 12:54.720
Oh, Rob.

12:54.720 --> 12:55.720
What?

12:55.720 --> 12:56.720
About four days ago.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.720
On YouTube or something?

12:57.720 --> 12:58.720
Yeah.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.360
I hadn't seen it in years.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.360
I hadn't seen it in years.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.360
It's the one-hit-lender song.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.360
I know, but still.

13:03.360 --> 13:08.680
NessusJ100Matt says, Rob, in a cabin in the woods with SingStar, horror movie plotline

13:08.680 --> 13:09.680
anyone?

13:09.680 --> 13:10.680
Kind of.

13:10.680 --> 13:11.840
It could have been.

13:11.840 --> 13:17.360
But there was a lot of songs I sang and had a pretty recognizable song list.

13:17.360 --> 13:22.400
I actually think I might want to pick this game up on PlayStation 3, although, only it's

13:22.400 --> 13:23.400
a party game.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.480
I mean, you know how there's those video games that really only work when you have friends

13:27.480 --> 13:28.480
over?

13:28.480 --> 13:29.480
SingStar's definitely one of those games.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.480
Let's wait for the WiiWare one.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.480
I think.

13:31.480 --> 13:32.480
Yeah, maybe.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.480
Because why get a PlayStation 3 for the crappy game?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.720
Well, I'm not going to get it just for that, but I like the fact that there's the music

13:36.720 --> 13:40.280
videos, the actual music videos in the background, and the way it's put together is nice.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.680
You know you just want it so you can film yourself and put yourself on that fake YouTube

13:43.680 --> 13:44.680
thing.

13:44.680 --> 13:45.680
Hell no.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.680
Hell no.

13:46.680 --> 13:47.680
I'm not going to be able to exploit it.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.320
I'm not going to subject myself to that.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.520
Can you imagine me getting on there singing Like a Prayer?

13:52.520 --> 13:55.160
You know what happened last time I sang Like a Prayer or Karaoke?

13:55.160 --> 13:59.880
Yeah, it's been like 10 years and I haven't lived it down, so not going to happen, sorry.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.960
Or if it is, it's set to private or something.

14:01.960 --> 14:02.960
We'll see.

14:02.960 --> 14:03.960
So.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.960
Alright.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.840
And that, and I played on the PSP, because William brought his PSP, he was playing the

14:08.840 --> 14:11.880
shit out of Puzzle Quest most of the time, I played more Final Fantasy while I was sick

14:11.880 --> 14:15.720
yesterday because I got food poisoning or something, I was sick all day yesterday.

14:15.720 --> 14:16.720
One.

14:16.720 --> 14:20.280
But it's the old school upgraded one on PSP, and I know I've talked about it on the show

14:20.280 --> 14:24.320
before a while back, but man, the graphics are just beautiful on the PSP.

14:24.320 --> 14:27.480
That's one thing the PSP does have going for it, is even though it has that little screen

14:27.480 --> 14:30.800
and everything, you know, the graphics are high def and gorgeous.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.680
That's one thing I really like about the PSP.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.460
So I kind of want to go and pick out, get Final Fantasy II so I can play that on my

14:37.460 --> 14:40.560
PSP and then if I want to borrow a Final Fantasy I will.

14:40.560 --> 14:44.240
I didn't get into the II, it was, I don't know.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.240
It's just different.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.240
Yeah.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.240
It's just different.

14:47.240 --> 14:52.920
Alright, well that's going to do it for our gaming week, so if you want to join in and

14:52.920 --> 14:58.720
chime in on our gaming weeks or the news for tonight, you can join our chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

14:58.720 --> 15:04.040
In the meantime, we do have some housekeeping for you guys.

15:04.040 --> 15:11.280
One thing that kind of made me sad, you know we have the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki at orangelaungeradio.wiki.com,

15:11.280 --> 15:15.160
and that is growing and growing and the people, the listeners that have been contributing

15:15.160 --> 15:17.600
to that are doing an awesome job, it's great.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.240
The bad news isn't about that.

15:19.240 --> 15:24.880
The bad news is about Wikipedia, the main site, you know, wikipedia.org.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.080
You know how Orange Lounge Radio had an article on there?

15:27.080 --> 15:28.080
It got zapped.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.080
Somebody deleted it.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.080
That's ridiculous.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.000
But here's the thing, here's the thing I don't get.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
I always thought that articles when they got deleted from Wikipedia had to go through a

15:37.000 --> 15:41.040
review phase for like articles pended for deletion or whatever and people are supposed

15:41.040 --> 15:42.040
to review it.

15:42.040 --> 15:46.240
So, when I looked at the deletion log, this guy named ClockworkSoul just nuked it.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.560
He must be some admin on there.

15:47.560 --> 15:53.560
He just nuked it and it said, web content does not indicate important significance.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.120
Sad.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.120
Without any debate or argument, this guy just kind of did it.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.520
Well, now you know who to go after.

16:00.520 --> 16:04.440
Well, I mean, I think we all kind of knew it was coming anyway, but I mean, I don't

16:04.440 --> 16:05.440
know, you know, we were...

16:05.440 --> 16:07.440
A warning would have been nice.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.920
I don't know, you know, we were one of the, we've been one of the longest running, you

16:10.920 --> 16:14.080
know, when we had the Live Through Six Five station, we were one of the longest running

16:14.080 --> 16:18.760
video game shows on the internet and, you know, now we're teamed up to probably form

16:18.760 --> 16:23.600
one of the, with all games, probably the most experienced out there on the internet.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.360
We were one of the first shows to use Skype, probably the first show to use Skype.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.280
I actually, there's a part of me that thinks we were the first only show to use Skype and

16:30.280 --> 16:32.760
I think I have the post to back that up.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.380
Not to toot our horn too much, but I think there are things we have accomplished that

16:36.380 --> 16:38.240
make it somewhat notable.

16:38.240 --> 16:45.560
Well, what about the other websites referred to on there that are still, you know, there?

16:45.560 --> 16:46.560
No.

16:46.560 --> 16:51.680
First site to use a PSP-based website, first gaming thing to have a PSP spin-off site,

16:51.680 --> 16:52.680
whatever.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.680
So let's just put it back up.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.280
Yeah, well, first and least updated.

16:57.280 --> 17:02.520
Yeah, but I would just say if you guys are going to go back and recreate it, you just

17:02.520 --> 17:05.640
might want to source some things, but you know, some of our news stories are on YouTube,

17:05.640 --> 17:08.080
whatever, but oh well, we'll see what happens.

17:08.080 --> 17:12.360
Regardless, we do have the OrangeLoungeRadio Wiki, which is like 10 times better anyway,

17:12.360 --> 17:18.520
and nobody can delete that, so whatever, whatever, see if we care.

17:18.520 --> 17:22.560
Our communities, we have Myspace.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, we have our Facebook community,

17:22.560 --> 17:27.920
the OL Army, our live journal community, OrangeLounge, join us if you are on any of those communities.

17:27.920 --> 17:32.660
Speaking of community, the All Games community has banded together for this.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.600
This is awesome.

17:34.600 --> 17:40.560
A limited edition Xbox 360 Elite based on Grand Theft Auto 4 is being given away.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.640
Now we have to correct something that was said last week's show.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.080
It is not one of the 500.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.080
That's the bad news.

17:46.080 --> 17:50.280
It is not one of the 500 Uber limited edition things that Mark Echo got one of when we were

17:50.280 --> 17:51.440
making fun of him.

17:51.440 --> 17:57.640
Where the other 499 went, we have no idea, but the good news is it's one of eight.

17:57.640 --> 18:03.800
This is one of eight Xboxes being prepared with the whole customization specifically for

18:03.800 --> 18:06.560
community websites as a Grand Theft Auto promotion.

18:06.560 --> 18:10.800
All Games dot com has one, and OrangeLoungeRadio is coming together with a bunch of All Game

18:10.800 --> 18:15.240
shows, including All Games Interactive, Dead Pixel Live, Bobby Black Wolf Show, Super Happy

18:15.240 --> 18:20.120
Fun Time Show, Electric Sisterhood, Media Spective, Chatterbox Video Game Radio, Video

18:20.120 --> 18:23.660
Game Outsiders, Ultimate Quest, Video Game Show, and Platformation, all coming together

18:23.660 --> 18:27.320
to give away this Xbox 360 Elite.

18:27.320 --> 18:31.280
If you want to win this, you can, because here's how it's going to work.

18:31.280 --> 18:35.680
Each one of those affiliates I just named is going to send one finalist to the final

18:35.680 --> 18:37.540
round, and here's how it works.

18:37.540 --> 18:40.280
Every show is doing the same giveaway.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.560
What's going to happen is that, okay, you know how Grand Theft Auto, one of the big

18:43.560 --> 18:48.400
things in it is the radio stations that play, you know, Grand Theft Auto, huge on the soundtracks,

18:48.400 --> 18:49.400
right?

18:49.400 --> 18:53.040
You know, the last one had what, like a four-disc soundtrack, and they play all these songs.

18:53.040 --> 18:59.180
Well, amidst the songs are fake DJs, and people tell me all the time I sound like that one

18:59.180 --> 19:01.400
DJ in Grand Theft Auto, what the hell is his name?

19:01.400 --> 19:02.400
Laszlo.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.400
Yeah, Laszlo, okay.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.520
Apparently, I sound like him.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.720
I don't know if that's true or not.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.880
I don't hear it, but I guess other people do.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.480
So, you know how Grand Theft Auto has those DJs and stuff, they have little commercials

19:11.480 --> 19:13.380
and fake DJ things.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.960
We want you to be that, okay?

19:15.960 --> 19:16.960
Here's how it works.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.920
You are going to submit a sound clip, it can't be any longer than two minutes, and it has

19:20.920 --> 19:25.600
to be in the style of a Grand Theft Auto 4 radio station commercial, okay?

19:25.600 --> 19:30.600
It can be a spoof ad, a segment, it can be a little song and dance, whatever.

19:30.600 --> 19:35.040
It has to somehow relate to Orange Lounge Radio, okay?

19:35.040 --> 19:36.120
That's the only thing.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.600
It can be one of our in-jokes, and if you don't know any in-jokes, go check the wiki.

19:39.600 --> 19:43.080
It can just say our name in it somewhere, whatever.

19:43.080 --> 19:46.880
It just has to somehow relate to Orange Lounge Radio.

19:46.880 --> 19:50.560
We will pick our favorites, like maybe our top five favorites.

19:50.560 --> 19:55.760
The community will vote on the winner, which will then go on to the final round at AllGames.com

19:55.760 --> 19:58.840
to win one of these eight rare 360s.

19:58.840 --> 19:59.840
That's like, what?

19:59.840 --> 20:05.640
Two minutes worth of voiceover for possibly an Xbox 360 Elite, one of eight being made

20:05.640 --> 20:07.440
in the world.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.440
So there you have it.

20:08.440 --> 20:13.980
So the contest starts tonight, and if you have an MP3 you would like to submit to us,

20:13.980 --> 20:14.980
you can send that on in.

20:14.980 --> 20:20.180
You can either send it to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, or we will set up a special page on our forums

20:20.180 --> 20:21.180
where you can send those in.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.180
We'll pick our favorites.

20:22.180 --> 20:25.640
The community will then vote on the winner, and then what happens is that the winning

20:25.640 --> 20:31.080
bumper goes to All Games Radio, and All Games Radio will choose the ultimate winner out

20:31.080 --> 20:32.080
of those.

20:32.080 --> 20:36.400
But hey, the good news is, just for winning from us, you get an All Games t-shirt and

20:36.400 --> 20:39.400
a $25 gift certificate to Shop.AllGames.com.

20:39.400 --> 20:44.040
They sell video games, so that's like half off a video game right there, so go for it.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.040
Submission starts tonight.

20:45.040 --> 20:51.720
You have to have these in by May 4th at midnight Pacific time, no late entries accepted.

20:51.720 --> 20:55.360
I know many of you listen to several shows on AllGames.com.

20:55.360 --> 20:59.400
You can submit multiple entries per multiple shows, but keep in mind you'll probably have

20:59.400 --> 21:03.560
to do different bumpers because, you know, since we're making you have something related

21:03.560 --> 21:08.020
to Orange Launch Radio, for example, Electric Sistahood would probably want something relating

21:08.020 --> 21:11.580
to their show, and so on and so on.

21:11.580 --> 21:15.080
We have the right to play your submission on our show, blah, blah, blah.

21:15.080 --> 21:19.080
If one person should win multiple contests, a coin flip determines the winner.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.280
Open to North American residents only.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.280
I'm sorry.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.660
US and Canada only.

21:23.660 --> 21:26.540
It's an NTSC console, so we can't give it to Europe.

21:26.540 --> 21:27.540
Those are the rules.

21:27.540 --> 21:28.540
Sorry, Europe.

21:28.540 --> 21:31.640
Yeah, and we can't really give it to anybody else because it's going to me.

21:31.640 --> 21:35.520
Unfortunately, cast and crew of the participating affiliate shows are not eligible.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.020
Sorry, Loki.

21:38.020 --> 21:41.720
And last but not least, no copywritten materials permitted in the entry.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.000
Parody is fine.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.240
You can't use, like, if you want to play Welcome to the Jungle, you have to, like, sing it

21:46.240 --> 21:49.400
yourself or something, or, you know, welcome to the radio or something.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.400
I don't know.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.880
You have to sing a makeup thing.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.680
So there you have it.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.800
ActDeft is asking, what about Mexico?

21:55.800 --> 21:58.280
I will have to ask the official judges about that.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.280
I think that counts as North America.

22:00.280 --> 22:04.640
I think that's okay, but I will get the final ruling on that shortly.

22:04.640 --> 22:07.360
Decisions of the judges are final, no bitching.

22:07.360 --> 22:11.700
If you like the full list of rules, they are available on forums.allgames.com, and we'll

22:11.700 --> 22:13.400
be posting them on our site soon.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.600
So that's, like, what, like the $500 prize right there?

22:16.600 --> 22:17.920
It's nice stuff.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.140
There's prizes for second and third place, too, but if I told you that tonight, I'd have

22:21.140 --> 22:23.840
nothing to tell you about next week when we plug the contest again.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.840
So get working on it.

22:24.840 --> 22:30.480
A two-minute commercial parody Orange Laundry, anything that would happen in one of those

22:30.480 --> 22:32.720
little radio bits in the Grand Theft Auto game.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.720
Be creative.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.920
If you want, if you don't have a fancy recording studio set up in your place, you can also

22:37.920 --> 22:42.600
leave it on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, when we're not live.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.480
You can call in and leave a bumper there.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.560
So don't say you don't have many different ways to send this in.

22:46.560 --> 22:51.360
It's all for you, Tali, anyways, because, like I said, and say it again, the console's

22:51.360 --> 22:52.360
going to me.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.360
Sorry.

22:53.360 --> 22:54.360
Even though you're ineligible.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.360
Even though I'm ineligible.

22:55.360 --> 22:56.800
Hell, I'm not even entering, and it's going to me.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.760
So that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

22:59.760 --> 23:00.760
Good luck with that, Logie.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.600
All right, let's get to some gaming news.

23:02.600 --> 23:10.840
All right, so anyways, this week we're going to start things out with a story that's not

23:10.840 --> 23:14.960
too surprising, since there was Marvel versus Capcom.

23:14.960 --> 23:21.560
Sure, let's do Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe, and of course they had a little teaser video.

23:21.560 --> 23:27.600
Actually, first there was an image that leaked out showing Sub-Zero staring down Batman,

23:27.600 --> 23:34.380
and then they actually fully veiled it for Midway's Gamer Day, and they were showing

23:34.380 --> 23:38.960
off a trailer featuring Sub-Zero fighting Batman.

23:38.960 --> 23:45.560
And the game itself, it looks, okay, I don't know, not a huge Mortal Kombat fan, but flying

23:45.560 --> 23:50.640
through the air while punching each other, falling, it's kind of hokey, but that's just

23:50.640 --> 23:52.280
my opinion, you know, whatever.

23:52.280 --> 23:56.160
It made me think of the more recent Dead or Alive games.

23:56.160 --> 24:01.400
All I gotta say is, I hope they have villains in there as well, other than just, because

24:01.400 --> 24:05.360
I think it'd be pretty badass if they had a cool version of Joker in there, okay, that

24:05.360 --> 24:06.360
might be pretty cool.

24:06.360 --> 24:09.640
It might also be in horrible taste, though, to play a fatality on the Joker.

24:09.640 --> 24:15.520
Okay, shut up, okay, fucking Jack Nicklaus is still alive, who cares if, you know, Jack

24:15.520 --> 24:17.560
Nicklaus was a golf player, you mean Jack Nicholson?

24:17.560 --> 24:18.560
Nicholson, whatever.

24:18.560 --> 24:22.600
Hey, you, little did you know, Jack Nicklaus was actually Joker at one time, and then Jack

24:22.600 --> 24:28.920
Nicklaus was, it's just, all these things you don't know about movies, there, Rob.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.520
Look, I said this on Bobby's show when we were doing our little tease before we went

24:32.520 --> 24:36.760
live tonight, the thing is, is that obviously this game's not going to have fatalities because

24:36.760 --> 24:40.160
it's going for a teen rating or whatever, right, but, you know, and people are like,

24:40.160 --> 24:43.800
oh my god, I can't believe it, what's a Mortal Kombat game without fatalities, but like,

24:43.800 --> 24:47.960
you know, it's kind of sacrilegious to be able to perform a fatality on Wonder Woman,

24:47.960 --> 24:52.080
come on, or on Batman, I mean, you can't decapitate Batman, you just can't.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.080
You can break Batman's back.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.080
You can do a friendship on Batman all you want, in fact, that might be kind of funny.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.080
You can break his back.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.080
That would be hilarious, because that's what happened to him.

25:00.080 --> 25:03.080
I think this should be mature, I mean, come on, stop twistying out, DC, seriously.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.280
You could, somebody said in chat earlier, you could kill Superman, but he'd just come

25:06.280 --> 25:07.280
back.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.280
Yeah.

25:08.280 --> 25:14.560
Because, I don't know, it's just sacrilegious, I don't know, don't ask me why, it's just

25:14.560 --> 25:18.000
something about seeing your childhood hero get decapitated is all kinds of wrong.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.520
Now, here's a question for you, Rob.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.520
But friendships are okay.

25:20.520 --> 25:27.160
Can you think of any game whatsoever that's had Superman in it that's been any good?

25:27.160 --> 25:30.440
Superman on the Atari 2600 when I was five years old was the shit.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.240
Okay, well, that doesn't count.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.240
Why not?

25:33.240 --> 25:35.160
You said name a Superman video game that was good.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.160
Okay, I was thinking, I don't know, within this decade.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.120
There was that Justice League game that was the...

25:40.120 --> 25:41.120
That wasn't very good.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.400
It was better than the straight Superman games.

25:44.400 --> 25:48.040
All the Superman, all the games that Superman has ever touched, crap.

25:48.040 --> 25:52.280
So I'm sorry, this isn't going to be very good, and it's Superman's fault.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.880
He should have stayed dead like a good superhero.

25:54.880 --> 25:59.840
Instead of a fatality, I'm thinking the game will have nudalities where the characters

25:59.840 --> 26:05.640
are forced to don their own underoos.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.120
I guess that wouldn't get a teen rating, though, would it?

26:07.120 --> 26:09.040
I hope the Wonder Twins are in it.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.040
Well...

26:10.040 --> 26:11.040
Because they're great.

26:11.040 --> 26:16.080
All I can say is this is going to come out and be yet another mediocre Mortal Kombat

26:16.080 --> 26:17.080
game.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.080
I...

26:18.080 --> 26:22.800
Am I the only one that actually enjoys Mortal Kombat's combat system, and I like the game...

26:22.800 --> 26:26.360
Like, I kind of liked how you could switch between the fighting styles and the weapons.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.360
If it's in the...

26:27.360 --> 26:29.960
I actually kind of enjoy the Mortal Kombat games, not just for the fatalities.

26:29.960 --> 26:35.960
If I'm to be fair, though, I don't like Street Fighter either, so, you know.

26:35.960 --> 26:40.920
I like the fact that, okay, personally I like the fact that everything was hand-drawn stuff

26:40.920 --> 26:41.920
in Marvel vs. Capcom.

26:41.920 --> 26:46.640
Hell, if they wanted to do a 2D fighter with the Mortal Kombat characters, all hand-drawn,

26:46.640 --> 26:50.720
in, you know, not really Mortal Kombat style, but kind of ripping off, I don't know, SNK

26:50.720 --> 26:53.360
or, you know, Capcom, that would be pretty badass.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.640
You know, do it, do it, like, DC comic style.

26:55.640 --> 26:56.640
That'd be pretty cool.

26:56.640 --> 27:01.520
See, I think that they should do a Marvel vs. DC fighter, so that all the Marvel characters

27:01.520 --> 27:03.240
would just beat up everybody in the DC universe.

27:03.240 --> 27:07.160
Yeah, but how much money would that cost to get both those licenses to play together nicely?

27:07.160 --> 27:11.640
But, as I said earlier, they've done it before.

27:11.640 --> 27:16.880
There's been, they've worked together before for plenty of comics, you know.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.880
Alright, let's read comments from chat room.

27:18.880 --> 27:22.800
SSJ100Matt wants to point out, there was a good Superman arcade game.

27:22.800 --> 27:28.360
Rama says, mind you, Mortal Kombat vs. DC idea has been around since Marvel vs. Capcom,

27:28.360 --> 27:30.840
which is funny because I know it's been brought up on this show before.

27:30.840 --> 27:34.760
I want to say this whole thing was in rumors state a couple months ago, and we joked about

27:34.760 --> 27:36.000
it then.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.640
Rama continues, and as much as I'm not too thrilled about not having fatalities, Mortal

27:39.640 --> 27:41.720
Kombat vs. DC does not need it.

27:41.720 --> 27:45.420
Yes, the fandom will be pissed off, but the DC fandom is bigger than the Mortal Kombat

27:45.420 --> 27:47.840
fandom, and you want to keep the natives happy.

27:47.840 --> 27:48.920
Here's what's going to happen.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.840
This game is going to be, okay, this is in development right now.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.300
It's scheduled out for the fall.

27:53.300 --> 27:54.680
What movie's coming out this summer?

27:54.680 --> 27:56.560
You know, The Dark Knight.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.400
What movie's going to probably be out on DVD in the fall?

27:59.400 --> 28:00.800
Here's where the whoring begins.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.480
They're just going to put this out at the same time as the fucking Dark Knight movie,

28:04.480 --> 28:07.320
and they're just going to try to sell some more copies on a mediocre game.

28:07.320 --> 28:10.960
Pardon my ignorance, I don't follow comic books, but is Iron Man DC or Marvel?

28:10.960 --> 28:11.960
Marvel.

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
Oh, never mind.

28:12.960 --> 28:13.960
That's not related.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.080
Because I was going to say there's the Iron Man movie coming out too, but I guess that's

28:16.080 --> 28:17.080
a whole...

28:17.080 --> 28:18.080
That's Marvel.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.080
That's Marvel whoring.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.080
Ah, that's why I asked.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.080
And I'm getting the Iron Man game too.

28:21.080 --> 28:27.760
Actually, that's Sega whoring Marvel characters, like that and the Incredible Hulk, both games

28:27.760 --> 28:31.560
which look good, but I think are going to be mediocre.

28:31.560 --> 28:35.880
You know, I think the last comic book I bought when I was maybe seven years old was Uncle

28:35.880 --> 28:38.440
Scrooge and Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

28:38.440 --> 28:39.880
I have comics right here.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.520
And you know what?

28:41.520 --> 28:42.520
What?

28:42.520 --> 28:43.520
Best comic book game ever.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.520
See?

28:44.520 --> 28:46.520
DuckTales was a pretty awesome comic book game.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.520
Comic book.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.520
Comics.

28:48.520 --> 28:49.520
Nice.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
X-Men.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.520
Is that what a comic looks like?

28:51.520 --> 28:52.520
It's a graphic novel.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.520
Nice.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.520
It's the older one too.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.520
That's what adults have to read nowadays, because you can't read comics.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.080
You have to read graphic novels.

28:57.080 --> 29:00.360
Hell no, I still buy comics.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.440
I got to ask this.

29:01.440 --> 29:06.320
Instapoll in chat, there is a greater comic book game than DuckTales.

29:06.320 --> 29:15.560
Y or N. Meanwhile, we'll see what the Instapoll results are in a minute.

29:15.560 --> 29:17.180
By the way, Tigerclaw wants to add this.

29:17.180 --> 29:20.640
I don't think this is in our show role anywhere, but speaking of Mortal Kombat, I don't know

29:20.640 --> 29:26.000
if you heard this, the actor who was Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat movie, Robin Shu, he

29:26.000 --> 29:30.520
is going to be Jen in the new Street Fighter movie.

29:30.520 --> 29:34.560
So there's that crossover there for Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter that one of the

29:34.560 --> 29:35.560
actors is going to be.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.960
That's very loose, Rob.

29:36.960 --> 29:37.960
I know.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.560
A little bit.

29:39.560 --> 29:45.520
And little does he realize what kind of crap he is walking into.

29:45.520 --> 29:50.880
Do we not forget Raul Julia and what happened to him in the last Street Fighter movie?

29:50.880 --> 29:52.920
He died after it was made, if I remember right.

29:52.920 --> 29:53.920
Yeah, okay.

29:53.920 --> 29:54.920
Yeah.

29:54.920 --> 29:58.320
Do you really want to admit yourself to something that is associated with death?

29:58.320 --> 29:59.320
I don't know.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.320
All right.

30:00.320 --> 30:04.200
Let's talk about something associated with eternal life, such as Soul Calibur, because

30:04.200 --> 30:06.520
thinking about this game makes me warm and fuzzy.

30:06.520 --> 30:09.900
And wasn't there like eternal life, soul lives on forever, whatever.

30:09.900 --> 30:10.900
The soul still burns?

30:10.900 --> 30:13.880
Well, the soul keeps burning on July 29th.

30:13.880 --> 30:17.360
Soul Calibur is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.800
I'm sorry, not on that day.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.000
Something else will come out that day.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.840
On Xbox Live Arcade though, sometime this summer, Soul Calibur is going to be coming

30:24.840 --> 30:25.840
out.

30:25.840 --> 30:31.000
It's going to be old school, because it's the Dreamcast version that's actually coming

30:31.000 --> 30:34.320
to Xbox Live Arcade, not the arcade version of Soul Calibur.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.960
It better have the Japanese voices in it.

30:36.960 --> 30:37.960
That would be kind of cool.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.960
Because my man was maxi.

30:39.960 --> 30:44.600
It will have arcade training and survival modes in it.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.360
And that was revealed at Namco's Gamers' Day.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.920
It is not the arcade version.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.560
It is the Dreamcast version.

30:51.560 --> 30:58.800
Now the question is, will it have to squeeze into that 150 megabyte limit or not?

30:58.800 --> 31:00.640
So that's going to be pretty rad.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.640
Especially if they're up the graphics to HD and all that other good stuff they usually

31:03.640 --> 31:04.640
do.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.640
That's going to be pretty rad, don't you think, Jamie?

31:05.640 --> 31:07.640
I think that would be fairly pretty.

31:07.640 --> 31:14.160
Soul Calibur is also, remember, they gave us rod caliber.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.160
That's the next question.

31:15.160 --> 31:19.000
Will we be able to use other interesting control devices on the Xbox 360?

31:19.000 --> 31:22.120
There isn't a fishing rod controller for that.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.560
No, but there's the scenic controller.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.560
That would be cool.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.560
We should have a contest.

31:27.560 --> 31:34.760
There's also the rock band drums, guitar caliber.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.680
We want guitar caliber, okay.

31:36.680 --> 31:43.800
Dude, I played Soul Calibur with my DDR pads because my first DDR I owned was the Dreamcast

31:43.800 --> 31:44.960
DDR.

31:44.960 --> 31:50.960
And the only analog button on there was the Konami logo to put it into SSR.

31:50.960 --> 31:54.680
And the question being asked in our chat room by none other than Bobby Black Wolf.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.800
In other words, will it blend?

31:56.800 --> 31:58.840
That's a very good question.

31:58.840 --> 31:59.840
Will it blend?

31:59.840 --> 32:00.840
Awesome.

32:00.840 --> 32:04.260
Here's the results of our quick poll and then we'll get to more Soul Calibur news courtesy

32:04.260 --> 32:05.960
of Jamie.

32:05.960 --> 32:08.920
Quick poll was, is there a comic book game better than DuckTales?

32:08.920 --> 32:10.920
Here are the results.

32:10.920 --> 32:17.760
N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, Y, X-Men Mutant Apocalypse.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.920
It's all about maximum carnage, I missed that one.

32:20.920 --> 32:28.560
Y, Superman 64, X-Men Arcade is a close second, N, Y, Marvel Superheroes versus Street Fighters,

32:28.560 --> 32:33.600
N, N, DuckTales freaking rocked, Y, X-Men Arcade.

32:33.600 --> 32:37.000
The X-Men Arcade game was really, really good.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.360
Looks like majority do believe DuckTales is the greatest comic book game ever made though.

32:40.360 --> 32:41.360
That's kind of surprising.

32:41.360 --> 32:48.160
But I can't count DuckTales as a comic book game because the show was out, there wasn't

32:48.160 --> 32:52.740
a DuckTales comic book until I think what, six months after the show had already been

32:52.740 --> 32:54.120
out for a while.

32:54.120 --> 32:58.660
So technically it was based off of, so that question's actually invalid.

32:58.660 --> 33:00.520
So our entire poll was a crock of shit.

33:00.520 --> 33:07.560
The entire poll wasn't just a crock of shit, it was a crock of compost.

33:07.560 --> 33:10.000
Well then why don't you take us back to reality Ms. Summers.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.480
Okay but I prefer unreality so how about more Soul Calibur news.

33:16.480 --> 33:23.720
Soul Calibur 4, you know what, I have hopes for this just because I didn't play the last

33:23.720 --> 33:27.080
one because it was, anyway.

33:27.080 --> 33:32.440
So Soul Calibur 4 is going to be out on July 29th and there will be a regular and a premium

33:32.440 --> 33:33.440
edition.

33:33.440 --> 33:38.400
What you talk about Jamie, Soul Calibur 3 was awesome.

33:38.400 --> 33:43.560
Here you could make, was it the Pope or was it the Pope character they made or was that

33:43.560 --> 33:45.240
in the moral combat?

33:45.240 --> 33:49.360
The Pope was in Soul Calibur 3.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.320
The pantsless Pope.

33:52.320 --> 33:56.600
I had a lot of friends actually make custom characters for that.

33:56.600 --> 34:02.000
That was the only thing I wanted and I don't know if this one's going to have any customize.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.560
The special edition I think was going to have some sort of thing for that.

34:06.560 --> 34:10.320
Well anyway you're going to get your choices of different characters like Darth Vader and

34:10.320 --> 34:17.520
Yoda and a bunch of other people and no spawn.

34:17.520 --> 34:20.800
That's okay though.

34:20.800 --> 34:26.200
But it's of course different versions are going to have different characters like PlayStation

34:26.200 --> 34:33.680
3 will have Darth Vader, Xbox 360 will have Yoda, but there are, but like you were saying

34:33.680 --> 34:39.240
the premium edition is going to have the extra customization content and a tournament kit

34:39.240 --> 34:42.760
and that will retail for $79.99.

34:42.760 --> 34:47.920
Okay Quandary, I'm getting my stimulus check like we all are hopefully pretty soon right

34:47.920 --> 34:53.120
and I'm thinking $600 perfect amount to finally take the splurge and buy my damn PlayStation

34:53.120 --> 34:55.440
3 right because you know there's going to be all this crap around Christmas time I'm

34:55.440 --> 34:58.360
going to want including home right.

34:58.360 --> 35:02.680
So here's the thing is that here's where I'm stuck is that I don't know whether to get

35:02.680 --> 35:08.000
Soul Calibur 3 for the PlayStation 3 or Xbox because I do think Vader is cooler than Yoda

35:08.000 --> 35:13.320
so I kind of want the PlayStation 3 version based on that alone but I know on Xbox Live

35:13.320 --> 35:17.120
the online is going to have to be better on Xbox Live.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.480
Well yeah.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.120
And there's going to be more people and there's achievements and so on.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.120
So what do I do?

35:22.120 --> 35:25.600
I know you guys are both buy in your console ownings.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.040
What do you think?

35:27.040 --> 35:28.560
Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3?

35:28.560 --> 35:32.080
I'm going to put the same question to Chad as another mini quick poll.

35:32.080 --> 35:35.160
Only for those of you guys that own both systems which one are you getting Soul Calibur 3 on

35:35.160 --> 35:39.100
and why if you're buying it or Soul Calibur 4 what the hell Soul Calibur 4 and why?

35:39.100 --> 35:45.680
I'm thinking that we'll probably go with the Xbox 360 edition just because Yoda is comical

35:45.680 --> 35:53.280
fighting but again it's like you said there's going to be more content out plus I also think

35:53.280 --> 35:58.440
that the Xbox 360 controller is just a little more comfortable for a fighting game.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.440
That's just me.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.800
Loki?

36:02.800 --> 36:05.440
I would just I wouldn't buy a system for that game.

36:05.440 --> 36:08.640
I'm not going to buy the system for the game I want the system for other stuff too but

36:08.640 --> 36:11.080
I'm just saying you know if I'm going to have the system anyway.

36:11.080 --> 36:15.440
I wouldn't buy the system until home comes out trust me I mean because who knows I mean

36:15.440 --> 36:19.000
seriously this summer you know they may be trying to drive sales they may drop the price

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
again.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.120
Okay okay okay let me confess I'm eyeing the whole gray metal MGS4 bundle.

36:25.120 --> 36:28.320
Alright good luck finding that.

36:28.320 --> 36:35.000
I would say you know just I guess I could be sort of biased towards the 360 but only

36:35.000 --> 36:39.520
because you should really look at the game more than just one character and I know that

36:39.520 --> 36:44.580
Darth Vader is cool and all but if you want to play Darth Vader kicking ass just buy Force

36:44.580 --> 36:49.120
Unleashed when that comes out but I don't know.

36:49.120 --> 36:53.560
Really how much did you well I guess Soul Calibur 2 I mean Link was pretty popular and

36:53.560 --> 36:54.560
stuff like that.

36:54.560 --> 36:59.040
Yeah exactly like you had to have Soul Calibur 2 on the GameCube because of Link hands down

36:59.040 --> 37:00.880
hands down.

37:00.880 --> 37:04.920
Anyway let's see we had all we actually have all of those all right let's let's let's look

37:04.920 --> 37:09.140
at the chat room what they thought J-Rod says PlayStation 3 equals Vader Vader greater than

37:09.140 --> 37:14.400
all Black Wolf says I'm getting the PlayStation 3 yes I have both because of Vader J-Rod says

37:14.400 --> 37:19.040
the only way to get more people on PlayStation Network is to buy the PlayStation 3 J-Rod

37:19.040 --> 37:28.040
says Soul Calibur 4 is PlayStation 3 for me let's see hit stun says you have to have Yoda

37:28.040 --> 37:35.800
versus Vader Quel Tipo says 360 fuck Vader Semeraw1215 says the PlayStation 3 version

37:35.800 --> 37:42.040
is better for Vader and the control is much better for Soul Calibur J-Rod answered the

37:42.040 --> 37:45.480
question like five times it's throwing me off footy monster said if I get it I'm gonna

37:45.480 --> 37:51.120
go 360 because that's what I own plus Yoda greater than Vader yes I said it bitches and

37:51.120 --> 37:55.560
RawsteelUT says stop hating the PlayStation 3 Loki I don't hate the PlayStation 3 it's

37:55.560 --> 38:00.840
just once again they've got the achievement system built in already I have more friends

38:00.840 --> 38:06.200
that are on you know the 360 you know I'll be getting you know exclusive games for the

38:06.200 --> 38:11.920
you know PS3 when those come out just right now if there's a game coming out on both platforms

38:11.920 --> 38:18.080
I'm gonna get it on the 360 um let's see and sj100 Matt says Rob here's what you do rent

38:18.080 --> 38:22.000
the 360 version and see if you even like it I know I'm gonna like it the Soul Calibur

38:22.000 --> 38:25.520
is like one of the few like hardcore fighting games I really really like who's to say I

38:25.520 --> 38:30.520
know I'm gonna like it Bobby said before who's to say that they could possibly you know add

38:30.520 --> 38:35.060
these as download content later on for the other systems you never know so you know that

38:35.060 --> 38:40.600
could be all for not and of course why would they pass up the opportunity to you know whore

38:40.600 --> 38:45.000
out themselves a little bit and you know sell the characters for an extra five bucks on

38:45.000 --> 38:49.360
top of the game I mean I could see them doing that especially now that we have download

38:49.360 --> 38:55.040
content available time will tell time was I would see them not so much the Vader Yoda

38:55.040 --> 38:58.340
thing but maybe bringing back classic Soul Calibur characters who maybe don't make the

38:58.340 --> 39:02.980
cut for Soul Calibur 4 or always were intended to be downloadables or something this should

39:02.980 --> 39:08.820
be a special mode we'll see or what do you want to bet if this custom creator thing is

39:08.820 --> 39:13.260
in it that's where your download content is going to be download new pants but the special

39:13.260 --> 39:20.860
mode should be the kill Voldo mode again and again and again oh yes again replace the punching

39:20.860 --> 39:26.140
bag mode with just Voldo yeah all right we'll see all right let's move on new game one thing

39:26.140 --> 39:31.580
you may be able to download content on for Soul Calibur 4 would be the brand new PlayStation

39:31.580 --> 39:37.860
store that's right this week after a brief bit of downtime they have finally brought

39:37.860 --> 39:43.660
back the PlayStation store with its new features and stuff it's a lot easier to browse and

39:43.660 --> 39:48.020
then finally kind of caught up on all the content that you know 360 owners have had

39:48.020 --> 39:54.460
for a while including still live for Rock Band and all that stuff so definitely worth

39:54.460 --> 40:02.660
checking out also coming along with that is the brand new firmware 2.30 and that's live

40:02.660 --> 40:11.900
as well and I don't know it's supposed to be enhancing I was a DTS HD and master high

40:11.900 --> 40:19.660
resolution audio so oh it looks a lot better I didn't really care for the old PlayStation

40:19.660 --> 40:24.940
store too much I still wish that the those prepaid cards are out there because that'd

40:24.940 --> 40:28.820
be pretty nice I could buy some a store credit instead of having actually the pony up real

40:28.820 --> 40:37.220
money for you know PlayStation money so you have yet to buy anything from the new store

40:37.220 --> 40:41.900
ah not yet from the new store be honest I haven't plugged in my PlayStation 3 in quite

40:41.900 --> 40:48.380
a while what you're not helping to cure cancer even fuck cancer well one thing that I'm

40:48.380 --> 40:51.180
just kind of surprised you haven't jumped out and downloaded although then again it

40:51.180 --> 40:57.980
is kind of expensive Gran Turismo 5 prologue it is now on the PSN store it's 1.9 gigabytes

40:57.980 --> 41:03.060
to download it 40 bucks if you want to download this by the full game at least you get a case

41:03.060 --> 41:10.060
with it and if you stop playing it later on you can sell it for you know money the weird

41:10.060 --> 41:15.140
thing is is that the intro video and the ending videos don't come with the game when you download

41:15.140 --> 41:20.180
it but you can download them later to view which is kind of strange you can only get

41:20.180 --> 41:24.560
the ending video of course after you've beaten Gran Turismo there's a whole documentary as

41:24.560 --> 41:29.260
well beyond the apex which is apparently only on the blu-ray version of the game so I guess

41:29.260 --> 41:33.380
you if you want a documentary you have that as well but seriously though that that's the

41:33.380 --> 41:38.580
only thing I could see why would they I know why they offered you know these games available

41:38.580 --> 41:42.500
to download but if they're offering a disc version of it I don't understand why people

41:42.500 --> 41:47.300
don't buy the disc version of the game since you know that's the thing you may get tired

41:47.300 --> 41:51.500
playing this game later on or say for example you want to sell it off before you know Gran

41:51.500 --> 41:56.460
Turismo 5 comes out why can't you can't do that with the download version you have to

41:56.460 --> 42:00.260
I can think it I think it may be two reasons one convenience especially for those that

42:00.260 --> 42:03.580
may live in the middle of nowhere where it's harder to get to a store your only option

42:03.580 --> 42:10.060
is like Walmart right to no sales tax in some places I don't know if because like I know

42:10.060 --> 42:13.540
on Nintendo if you live in California you know you charge sales tax on we point same

42:13.540 --> 42:17.300
thing with Xbox so I don't think on PlayStation which uses real money I don't think you get

42:17.300 --> 42:22.460
charged sales tax which is kind of great so you save a few bucks there but just saying

42:22.460 --> 42:27.300
I'm just saying though wouldn't you rather have a case and all that stuff for I don't

42:27.300 --> 42:31.780
know I just like if a game came out on the Xbox Live Arcade and I had a choice of downloading

42:31.780 --> 42:36.860
there or buying it in a store I'd buy it in a store that's just me I guess what about

42:36.860 --> 42:39.740
the PopCap game well I guess those didn't come out till way later yeah they didn't come

42:39.740 --> 42:45.460
out until way later and I mean I don't know RossDielUT is pointing out in chat Rob the

42:45.460 --> 42:49.980
middle of nowhere isn't going to have broadband I guess that's kind of true well yes and no

42:49.980 --> 42:54.540
I think broadband is really spreading out more and more especially as a satellite in

42:54.540 --> 42:59.340
some form starting to support like a broadband-esque type of connection and really really middle

42:59.340 --> 43:04.140
of nowhere there's always going to be a Walmart around they pop up like I guess it's Starbucks

43:04.140 --> 43:08.380
all right maybe a bad excuse but I don't know just trying to think obviously somebody's

43:08.380 --> 43:12.100
buying it or they wouldn't be putting it out there true well see here I like what they

43:12.100 --> 43:17.620
did with Warhawk where they well originally they had it where you can buy the version

43:17.620 --> 43:22.300
you know in stores and it came with a Bluetooth headset and that was how they kind of you

43:22.300 --> 43:25.420
know you can do this and get all this extra stuff or if you don't want to buy that you

43:25.420 --> 43:29.580
can just download the version of the game then later on they came out with the version

43:29.580 --> 43:37.040
that's just the game only but I don't know it's still I would rather buy it on disk I

43:37.040 --> 43:42.300
guess all right you used to mention you and the husband got this game this week right

43:42.300 --> 43:47.720
grant that he wants a grand theft auto Gran Turismo yeah Dan was playing quite a bit of

43:47.720 --> 43:52.180
it he had his cousin over playing it I didn't really watch it because you know me I don't

43:52.180 --> 43:58.260
really give a crap was it pretty I said I didn't watch any of it I didn't give a crap

43:58.260 --> 44:02.140
I thought maybe at least glanced at it once or twice I looked a little bit it was pretty

44:02.140 --> 44:07.580
all right see that's what I was looking for but did you guys actually go get the box version

44:07.580 --> 44:13.780
or did you download it I think that Dan bought it yeah he pranks the discount anyway because

44:13.780 --> 44:18.300
the whole game store connection thing yeah probably yeah make sense but he was pretty

44:18.300 --> 44:22.660
happy about it I mean he was like I was like so why do you and I straight out asked him

44:22.660 --> 44:27.460
was like why did you want to pay money for glorify demo and he's like well honestly I

44:27.460 --> 44:33.760
look at this as more of a part a you know sort of thing you know that the game comes

44:33.760 --> 44:41.060
out this is almost a full game as it is it has a lot of content already he said you know

44:41.060 --> 44:45.500
this is really makes me want the full version more when it comes out and I don't mind having

44:45.500 --> 44:50.700
this to tide me over I was like well put that way I do sort of understand especially he's

44:50.700 --> 44:54.460
so excited about everything that was there so far but he was so mad he tried to go buy

44:54.460 --> 44:58.860
himself a Lancer Evo right off the bat and was seven thousand short don't I was like

44:58.860 --> 45:03.220
haha but I mean your man's really into racing games this is seems like every time I go over

45:03.220 --> 45:06.700
there there's something there's burnout or there's something you know there's a lot of

45:06.700 --> 45:11.900
times I see racing games on the TV so yeah all right anyhow sorry I just thought I'd

45:11.900 --> 45:14.980
ask because I know you're talking about that before the show but why don't we go into some

45:14.980 --> 45:20.580
other gaming news well we do have other gaming news and this is about the PSP apparently

45:20.580 --> 45:30.460
the PSP is still hot shit in Japan I don't know why but it is right now in order of systems

45:30.460 --> 45:38.100
sold number six is the Xbox 360 PlayStation 2 is after that PlayStation 3 is after that

45:38.100 --> 45:45.220
we is after that by quite a bit let me actually just go back and give the give the numbers

45:45.220 --> 46:01.820
so Xbox 360 is at 1147 PlayStation 2 is 6834 PlayStation 3 is 8232 we is 46296 the DS 47158

46:01.820 --> 46:10.460
and PSP at 85,721 if that's going to put it into perspective as far as what was sold in

46:10.460 --> 46:21.240
the past week so just PSP is really got it now and actually I was looking through a couple

46:21.240 --> 46:29.580
of back issues of Famitsu when I was at Kinokuniya and there were plenty of PSP ads just in terms

46:29.580 --> 46:37.060
of ads there were just more and you know there's actually a couple of full just PSP only magazines

46:37.060 --> 46:41.180
so I thought that was kind of interesting Loki any thoughts on why the PSP is really

46:41.180 --> 46:46.460
taking off in Japan all of a sudden Monster Hunter I don't know they like the Monster

46:46.460 --> 46:54.260
Hunter maybe Monster Hunter on PS3 that'd be pretty awesome could be okay for one game

46:54.260 --> 46:57.660
I don't know if it's gonna be big in Japan but it's gonna be big everywhere else Grand

46:57.660 --> 47:04.340
Theft Auto 4 it's gone gold and is apparently on the way to retail stores for you know one

47:04.340 --> 47:09.740
lucky person at Target or Walmart to break street and probably have it out there early

47:09.740 --> 47:16.300
like they do every time so keep your eyes out it'll be available soon also for everybody

47:16.300 --> 47:23.100

48:01.180 --> 48:07.340
large shoe company yes and how to sell games yes interest okay a certain website begins

48:07.340 --> 48:17.060
with Z okay wow apples no but hold back so yeah I get to go to Vegas I was actually thinking

48:17.060 --> 48:24.380
about bringing my 360 with me to play you know during cuz I'm going for a day we're

48:24.380 --> 48:28.800
actually training them on like different kind of giving them like the games 101 type shit

48:28.800 --> 48:32.380
I'm sure they're I'm sure we have I know we have listeners in Vegas I'm sure there's some

48:32.380 --> 48:37.480
out there would be like Loki come over we'll play I'll buy pizza and beer come on but here's

48:37.480 --> 48:42.880
the thing my my boss reminded me he's all you know there's gonna be 360 is there so

48:42.880 --> 48:47.140
you can just bring grant the thought or with you I'm like I know but I want to bring it

48:47.140 --> 48:52.060
I don't know if I should bring it on the plane here to be in freaking Las Vegas and you want

48:52.060 --> 48:56.200
to play a video game I'm like I'd be going out gambling going to shows screw video games

48:56.200 --> 49:01.460
I don't have that I'm getting there late on Wednesday in the next day is a training thing

49:01.460 --> 49:08.580
and then the day after that I'm leaving come back on Friday so and Gerardo mo and chat

49:08.580 --> 49:17.260
says an unnamed website presents buying shoes online the game imagine buying shoes anyway

49:17.260 --> 49:30.860
oh my god shoes this game rules this game sucks your controllers kind of big I don't

49:30.860 --> 49:37.020
think we have anything in your size let's see moving on another series that people are

49:37.020 --> 49:44.420
pretty into who likes their survival horror me do you like the game siren okay maybe not

49:44.420 --> 49:50.900
well like it or not siren is getting a new translation that's what they call it it's

49:50.900 --> 49:55.940
from from you to magazine it's siren new translation it's a PlayStation 3 remake actually that

49:55.940 --> 50:00.780
might you know your magazine yeah I think it was it might actually be in there well

50:00.780 --> 50:04.500
apparently you know if you forgot what the original game was all about it was these souls

50:04.500 --> 50:09.580
were trying to get out of a Japanese village and they can only see through the eyes of

50:09.580 --> 50:14.980
nearby creatures that's how it works July 24th is the day it's supposed to come out

50:14.980 --> 50:20.860
but the demo is supposed to be out very very soon in Japan so if you were a fan of siren

50:20.860 --> 50:26.380
and to which J rod and chat says siren is absolutely terrible avoided at all costs and

50:26.380 --> 50:31.860
they also have a big likes well siren in the game that sounds just like the one from sound

50:31.860 --> 50:38.620
hills well I don't want to say rip off because the game I think was out before so well tippo

50:38.620 --> 50:42.780
says hooray for siren when nothing you do makes much sense you just have to do it anyway

50:42.780 --> 50:45.820
what if they go back and fix all the problems that make the graphics even prettier would

50:45.820 --> 50:51.300
that make this game worth owning I don't know hey you know nothing's gonna hurt having another

50:51.300 --> 50:54.840
you know survivor horror game out there there really isn't that many yeah but then you just

50:54.840 --> 50:59.540
have to keep reminding yourself Silent Hill 5 this year Silent Hill 5 this year well you

50:59.540 --> 51:04.980
hope it's this year I hope it better be especially after seeing the little preview clips for

51:04.980 --> 51:14.340
it I'm so freaking excited it's boneriffic I don't know if I'd go that far I couldn't

51:14.340 --> 51:18.060
find the article that's all right how about some different gaming news then how about

51:18.060 --> 51:26.540
some rock band all righty I'll take it well harmonix is gonna have up a downloadable album

51:26.540 --> 51:32.620
for a rock band is gonna be available next week and it's called I'm screaming for vengeance

51:32.620 --> 51:40.380
by Judas Priest and it has 10 tracks that will cost $15 and it's both for ps3 and Xbox

51:40.380 --> 51:48.960
360 and each of the songs will be $2 apiece and then there's going to be a later on coming

51:48.960 --> 51:53.500
in May there'll be an album by the cars and then do little by the Pixies the Pixies are

51:53.500 --> 51:59.020
cool so it looks like they're just still working on trying to get those out I think that's

51:59.020 --> 52:04.860
a kind of a neat idea and they said that though that they were supposed to have The Who have

52:04.860 --> 52:12.340
a first downloadable album but they said that that's going to be later on it's very interesting

52:12.340 --> 52:16.540
that they're going this download album route especially in the day and age where you know

52:16.540 --> 52:21.020
I don't know this is probably a bit of a controversial statement but where music seems to be getting

52:21.020 --> 52:25.340
away from the albums I mean sad but true we live in this iTunes world now where it's very

52:25.340 --> 52:29.820
easy to buy the one song that you like and a lot of people don't ever take the time to

52:29.820 --> 52:33.580
listen to the entire album so I find it kind of interesting the rock band is kind of going

52:33.580 --> 52:38.580
this route where they're standing behind the albums in a way you know but I mean maybe

52:38.580 --> 52:41.620
that's why you know when I read the news I was kind of surprised to see that they were

52:41.620 --> 52:46.000
going for what really seems like the classics like it seems like they're going for the classics

52:46.000 --> 52:53.100
more than anything right so that was kind of surprising but I guess when you think about

52:53.100 --> 52:57.700
well in the classics that's when the albums were really albums maybe it's not so surprising

52:57.700 --> 53:03.060
I don't know well you know and I also think that it's sad that we really don't have albums

53:03.060 --> 53:11.420
as a big format anymore just because from an artistic point of view keep in mind what

53:11.420 --> 53:14.620
all went into making an album you know with your cover and everything and you had all

53:14.620 --> 53:22.500
the publishing I think that that actually is sort of a neat thing as far as its nostalgic

53:22.500 --> 53:28.100
value you know what I mean I'm looking at chat comments hitstunz in chat that orange

53:28.100 --> 53:32.500
on twitter.com says when I download stuff I get the whole album J rod says rock band

53:32.500 --> 53:40.460
needs more modern metal act F says I'm an iTunes boy living in an iTunes world Sephiroth

53:40.460 --> 53:46.500
1215 says I'm waiting for never mind to come out I'll get the whole album for that we'll

53:46.500 --> 53:52.820
see that would be classic classic rock especially for this generation you know that early 90s

53:52.820 --> 53:56.780
stuff is really the defining classic rock it's kind of interesting it's interesting

53:56.780 --> 54:03.260
it's interesting I know I know we're getting old we ain't getting any younger but hey while

54:03.260 --> 54:07.180
we age we have a lot of new games and things coming out around the world look forward to

54:07.180 --> 54:12.060

Enix role-playing game so definitely worth checking out totally sounds like a James Bond

56:01.300 --> 56:07.760
want to skip target terror and by Konami apparently one of the ugliest games for the Wii this

is a game that came out of the arcade circa 1990s with wonderful mocap technology kind

56:14.100 --> 56:22.940

56:59.300 --> 57:04.140
longest time Phantasy Star Universe ambition of the illuminous max attack G begins I guess

57:04.140 --> 57:09.140

57:09.140 --> 57:13.380

57:18.040 --> 57:22.580
I miss caves that much who doesn't miss caves those damn little plants that kept paralyzing

57:22.580 --> 57:28.500
you all the time anyhow traveling to Japan and looking at some of the releases over there

57:28.500 --> 57:33.260

57:51.740 --> 57:56.740
Vegas except that's just a price reduction on the PlayStation 3 trying to figure out

57:56.740 --> 58:01.340
what this Valkyrie game is here it's it's actually a game that we're getting over here

58:01.340 --> 58:08.020
in the fall it's a turn-based RPG it combines strategy with action and you proceed in the

58:08.020 --> 58:15.960
game like it's a history book no it's not Valkyrie profile is it's from Sega so kind

58:15.960 --> 58:20.600
of interesting you read text get involved with battle parts and depending on the option

58:20.600 --> 58:24.860
you've chosen the battles you've thought or the battles you fought the game rewards you

58:24.860 --> 58:30.780
with more chapters in the book so it's like you make history sounds kind of interesting

58:30.780 --> 58:35.940

is a queen of pollution in school seeking to bring the school down by dirtying it and

59:25.940 --> 59:30.620
the only way to stop her is to form the clean keeper squad by rescuing all the cleaning

59:30.620 --> 59:35.340
fairies that's why the girls who can see and bond with these fairies this game I think

59:35.340 --> 59:45.020

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.740
what reason all right back to some more gaming news uh some other things actually coming

nes the one and only river city ransom finally making its way out um barf on the genesis

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:37.020
uh we get a cool rpg fancy star three generations of doom and that's it all right pretty cool

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:42.660
um hey the rock band on the wii you know one of the big things is downloadable content

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:47.140
of course on the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 uh well unfortunately the wii doesn't have

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:51.160
the same setup so you might remember when it was announced uh that rock band was coming

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:55.820
to the wii they were going to have five bonus songs that the xbox 360 and the playstation

01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:01.640
3 didn't have on the disc but they do have as downloadable content as we found out this

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.460
week the five bonus songs on the wii are just download songs from the other systems dirty

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:11.200
Little Secret by the All-American Rejects, Don't Look Back in Anger by Oasis, Rome by

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.380

for Roxanne by the Police.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.000
Good songs!

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.680
I actually own two of those five as download songs, and I don't even own that many songs,

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.960
but a little bit disappointing to some that they are just simply download songs from the

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960
other systems.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.480
But they will be right there on the Wii disc to offset the fact that you won't be able

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.000
to download anything else for now, for a while.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.760

Drive game for 800 Wii points.

In US and Canada, we got Fantasy Zone for Master System, yay, and Mega Turrican.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:54.280
For PC, a demo of Kung Fu Panda came out, whatever Kung Fu Panda is.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.280
Sounds pretty awesome.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.280
I guess.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:02.000
Kung Fu Panda, that's based on the Jack Black film, I think.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.360
Oh, okay.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:09.520
Steam brought out Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Trackmania United, which gives free access to Trackmania

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.200
United Forever, and Trackmania United Forever was also free.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.880
Well, the Trackmania United was 40 bucks.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.920
Metabolie Ultimate Collection, Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, Exo Cubes, Essential Collection

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:25.400
is Heroes of Might and Magic 5.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:29.200
That'd be all R. Damn you, Jamie.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.160
Well, now I have Message in a Bottle stuck in my head.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.160
This is the best police song ever.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.160
Message in a Bottle.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.160
Message in a Bottle.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:44.560
This is my favorite police song ever, ever, and the fair degrees too.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.200
That was not Message in a Bottle, that was Gibberish.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.480
That was Gibberish and a ferret.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:56.240
All right, so we know that Mario Kart is already out now in Japan and Europe.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:00.440
Now you would think, of course, Nintendo game, it's gonna be probably the top-selling game

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.360
ever.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.880
Not really in its first week, actually.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:05.820
In Japan, it didn't fare too well.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:13.840
It ended up being number three, beaten out by Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G, and another

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:23.120
not really a game, but a UMD video, Boku Daki no Kaji-Tsu, and that actually translates

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:31.800
to Only My Fruit, and it's an erotic, like, hentai UMD video or game or something.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.800
So that's kind of funny.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:36.720
Erotic PSP game beats out Mario Kart Wii.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:41.200
If only they had more jubilees in Mario Kart Wii, maybe.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:47.080
Nintendo is sending out an SOS about right now.

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.560
Seriously, how to get beaten by porn.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.840
I mean, is this like something that's really, really popular in Japan or something, this

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:53.840
series?

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.840
Yeah, Akihabara.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.840
Huh.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.200
Wait, but this is only, also, this is only one store's chart, right?

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.680
This isn't like the whole country's chart.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.680
No, this is Akihabara.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.720
All right, so maybe it's a little bit much to say that OMG, Mario Kart Wii gets its butt

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.600
kicked by porn in the entirety of Japan.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.100
No, it's just one store.

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.920
And maybe this is the only store where you can buy this particular game.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:17.240
Sort of like how here, you know, Walmarts and Targets don't carry certain games, right?

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.240
Yeah.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.240
Maybe.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.240
If they only carry more porn games, you know.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.160
Who knows?

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.160
We'll see.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:31.280
Well, speaking of Wii fun times in Japan, Resident Evil 0 has been given a date for

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280
Japan.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.520
Now, of course, this game was already on the GameCube, but, you know, Resident Evil 4 on

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.600
the Wii turned out pretty good, so hell, why not?

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.600
Let's port this over.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.240
July 10th will be the day that this comes out.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.000
4,190 yen will be the price.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.640
Now, it's only announced for Japan right now, but, you know, if this sells over in Japan,

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.440
I don't see why they wouldn't bring this over here.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.400
Like I said, Resident Evil 4 Wii didn't do too bad, so why the hell not?

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.400
Excuse me.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.360
There you have it.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:07.760
Well, there has been an ESRB game rating released because of blood and fantasy violence, and

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.320
it's set for something on the Nintendo DS.

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.320
Can we guess what that is?

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.320
Huh?

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.360
Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.200
Hey, didn't we talk about this a couple weeks ago?

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.440
Yep, it is for the DS.

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.440
Who would've thought, kid?

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.200
Who would've thought that those secrets slip out and...

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.200
I like fantasy violence.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.200
Sure enough.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.820
It sounds kinda dirty.

01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:30.480
Don't all the Castlevania games have fantasy violence?

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.720
Don't any game have fantasy violence?

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.360
Any good game has fantasy violence.

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.240
All games have fantasy violence.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.960
But the best ones have real violence.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.720
None of them have real violence.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.680
It's all fantasy.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:50.600
It's all you perceiving one character beating up another, but it's just fucking data.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.600
You know what, though?

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.920
WhatTheyPlay.com Snap will have real violence.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.900
But will it blend?

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:56.900
We hope.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:00.360
I don't know if it'll blend, since it's an idea.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.760
I don't think you can get ideas into a blender.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.760
Just yet.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.880
It'll be a new blender with mind control capabilities.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.120
You never know.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.120
I don't know if this'll blend.

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.280
It may blend on the Wii.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:23.120
But apparently Namco has announced another, yes, there is actually another already, cheerleader

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.600
game for the Wii.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.260
It's called Wii Cheer.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:34.040
It features cartoony cheerleaders jumping around and stuff, and you apparently use the

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.600
game, each one of your pom-poms, I guess, in the game is actually a Wii remote.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:45.560
So you use two Wii remotes and kind of think like a Wii version of yet another cheering

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.000
game, Oh and Done, or Elite Beat Agents.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.200
It's kind of like that, is how you play the game.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:56.600
I would be interested in this if they had just called it Bring It On, the game.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.280
And it forces you to use spirit fingers.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.320
Spirit fingers.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.720
That movie was...

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:05.720
Was incredible.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.720
I don't know.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.000
That's the only way you're allowed to finish that sentence.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.580
Don't get me wrong, this is like, I guess, a cool idea for girls, because the video,

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.700
the trailer showed girls playing this game.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:19.040
Why's it gotta be an only a girl game, huh?

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.480
Well, because they showed little girls playing the game.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.440
Do you want to play a game that little girls play?

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.440
Maybe.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.720
I don't know.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.160
This is kind of...

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.480
I don't think I could play this game.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.600
I would feel dirty playing this game.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.440
Okay I gotta look at some of this trailer.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.400
Aw, little girls dancing and happy.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.960
This makes horrible radio.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:50.400
Oh yes, and they butcher the songs, by the way.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.560
So they're probably going to be all horrible cover versions.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.520
Create your own cheerleader, Jamie, custom mode.

01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.520
Look at that.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.520
You like that, don't you?

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.520
Alright I'll end the...

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.520
I'd probably make a cheerleader...

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.880
I'll end the torture for our chat.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.760
...killer or something.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.880
They look like they're all having fun.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.240
That's what games are all about, right?

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.440
Because they're paid to look like they're having fun.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.040
What was the game called again?

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.040
We cheer.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.740
We cheer.

01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:22.120
Just like we ski.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.120
We cheer.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.740
We starve ourselves to fit in the outfit.

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:28.800
They do kind of look like they have starved themselves.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.800
They're children.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.800
Be nice.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.240
They're children on TV.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:38.280
Then they'll have the, you know, We Need to Get to Dallas, the Debbie Does Dallas sequel

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.200
for the game.

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.120
Fireboma says, Sky's sold as soon as he hears that song.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.200
It is a good song.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.000
Who doesn't like that song?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Don't it feel good?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.040
I actually am really annoyed by that song.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.680
Well poop on you.

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.120
Sorry Debbie Downer.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.520
Wah wah.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.520
Hey Rob.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.520
What?

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.520
Rob.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.520
Rob.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.520
Rob.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520
Rob.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.520
Rob.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.520
Rob.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.520
Rob.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.520
Rob.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520
Rob.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520
Channel Z says they show a boy playing at the end of the We Cheer video.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520
Boys can be cheerleaders.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.520
Why not?

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.520
Smart boys are cheerleaders.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.520
You know why?

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.520
Why?

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.520
Because they get to put their hands up the girls' skirts all day long.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520
Alright.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.520
Touche.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.520
Huh?

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.960
How can you respond to that?

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.960
You can't.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.960
Exactly.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.960
Alright.

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:29.960
If you saw Bring It On, you'd know this.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.880
There was the gay cheerleader who was, you know, cheerleading because he was gay.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.360
And then there was the cheerleader who was, you know, just there to hit on all the women.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.000
Yeah, that's the thing.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.080
He can hit on all the women, but he ain't gonna get any of them.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.920
Alright.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.040
Let's look at another game here.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.480
It's Okami on the Wii.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:58.160
And the funny thing about Okami on the Wii is that, well, the box art is kind of screwy.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.920
And when I say screwy, I mean stolen.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920
That's right.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:07.720
If you look very carefully at the Okami box art, apparently you can zoom in on a portion

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.720
of it.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.080
It's not far from the dog's mouth there, the wolf or whatever you want to call it.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:18.880
If you zoom in on that, you can see very faintly a watermark that says IGN.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:26.040
In other words, Capcom lifted the IGN art from the website or whatever to make the Wii

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.440
box art for Okami.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.440
Isn't that funny?

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.160
They stole their own artwork from a website.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.360
I think that's really funny.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:37.320
I don't know why.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.480
And apparently it's legit.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.720
You can go look at a box for this game and it's there.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.560
I don't know if they'll be able to fix it at one point, at some point later, but apparently

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.480
the press releases that have gone out already have this on there.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.480
People have confirmed it.

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.000
There you have it.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.840
Frisbee in chat says, Capcom googled their own box art.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.840
Apparently they did.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.020
There you have it.

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.280
Someone's getting fired.

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.280
Someone totally got fired.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.280
Ha, ha, ha.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.280
All right.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.880
We're about ready to take a break here and go from part A to part B, but first it just

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:15.640
would not be an Orange Ons Radio part A if we did not pay tribute to video game classics.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:19.040
And we do that with a little segment here on the show called our classic video game

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:22.760
of the week.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.600
Dark Sakura goes through her vast archives of video games and picks out one classic for

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.960
you all to pay respect to.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.280
What's it going to be this week, Dark Sakura?

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.280
Strider.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.800
Bitches better recognize.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.400
And unfortunately the only copy of the first level that I could find was the Genesis version.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.200
However, this was one of the first of their eight meg titles that they bought out.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.760
Oh, you can't start it past where the music is.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:49.760
Wait.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.760
Don't you start at the very beginning?

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.760
Yeah.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.760
Yeah.

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:53.760
Right there.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.760
This is classic.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:04.400
But this is the game that actually in Japan was called Strider Yu Yu and it gave us the

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:11.040
character from Ronald vs. Capcom, but basically it's a platformer and it's actually very

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:18.520
interesting because all of the in-between areas are basically the characters speaking

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.240
their native languages, but they're speaking them to each other and can apparently understand

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.240
everybody else.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.160
I guess they have translators in the future like that, but you go through different levels

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:34.040
and the first one starts off, you have to fight this guy called Grandmaster Mayo and

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.840
you're going through different areas.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:43.880
You start off in the Soviet Union, the next one is, I think the next level is in Siberia.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:50.960
There you have the Amazon rainforest, you've got a big platform in space and actually this

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:54.920
is my favorite level to do because as you're going through that you are on the ground and

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:58.400
then gravity reverses and you're in other areas and then you have to fight this thing

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.400
that you move in a circle around.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:06.000
But his weapon is called a cypher, which is like this swinging tonfa style blade, but

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.800
as you get power up he'll extend further and he'll get his little mechanical animal buddies

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:20.560
to help him out, like a falcon and a big saber tooth tiger and his little things that, okay,

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.240
I don't think they actually got names until Marvel vs Capcom came out, but the little

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:32.680
tiny things were called Ouroboros, but that was also one of the bosses in the game too.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:37.920
Okay the stage in this was St. Petersburg, the Siberian wilderness, the aerial battleship,

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:45.080
Amazon, and the third moon, but it was just a really kind of an epic sort of game.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:53.240
The thing about the in between areas is that, for example, after you fight, there's the

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:58.240
area where you fight three girls with the bosses and one of them is Pompou who was also

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:05.320
one of the helper characters in Marvel vs Capcom, but she speaks Chinese, produced Japanese,

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:13.360
the bounty hunter guy speaks English, I see they didn't do it on the on the Genesis one

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.040
for the arcade one, it had all the places.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.680
It also, there were other versions that came out, like the one that we were listening to

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:29.000
was the the Genesis one, but it's been on the Amiga, the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:39.320
64, ZX Spectrum, and there's been a Master System version and a Sharp X68000 version.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:46.840
There was one on, we actually have a burn of this, the version that was going to be

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:58.240
Super Graphics CD, we actually have a copy of the proto for it, but we don't have the

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:03.000
arcade card to play it with.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:10.200
There's also, I will tell people that there is a Nintendo version, however, just to let

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:16.160
people know is that that was actually based off of the Strider comics that came out in

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.600
Japan and is not anything like, it's very interesting because when I, you know, I didn't

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:25.640
have a Genesis growing up, we only had a Nintendo, but I do remember Strider on the Nintendo

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.200
and I love that game, but it is completely different than this game.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.880
This game is more of like a platformer, where as Strider on the NES was a bit more like

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.880
Adventure.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:41.200
Yeah, it was a bit more Bionic Commando and that triangle jump made me want to kill people,

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:45.320
but I mean, it's so interesting that you have both games that were Strider yet, they were

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.680
so completely freaking different.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.680
This is very interesting.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.280
Well, part of the reason with this was they were actually going to leave out the, as far

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.400
as I'm aware, now this is coming from my husband and for anyone who kept up on older video

01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:02.040
game sites, my husband used to run one called Neo Strider Strider Zone and I did all, I,

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:08.360
you know, fixed all of his graphics on it for him, but Dan is like full of Strider trivia,

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:13.800
but he's like, when they were first going to bring it out on Genesis slash Mega Drive,

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.720
that there wasn't enough memory to accommodate the full game, they were going to leave out

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:24.920
the Amazon level and ended up just creating their 8 meg cartridges to, to accommodate

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920
the entire game.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.560
And I have to say, it's pretty damn close to arcade perfect.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.360
It's very, very good.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:40.160
And for anyone who picked up the, this sequel, there actually was one called Strider Returns,

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:45.360
that was a journey from darkness Strider Returns, but it was really kind of shitty.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.800
But we had Marvel versus Capcom, like I kept mentioning, and he was in, it was basically

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:56.480
all of his moves for the game, Hideo and Hien, who was in Strider 2, were in the Namco Capcom

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.480
game.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:02.640
And there was also, the lead programmer of Strider left Capcom and created a game called

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:10.600
Osman, which was also called Canon Dancer, and a lot, it plays basically just like Strider

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.760
is a lot of the same type of game.

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:18.960
It did get a really good sequel called Strider 2, which was really freaking good, but that'll

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:23.000
be touched on at a later date.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.040
So Strider 2 is different than Strider Returns?

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.040
Or are they the same?

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:32.040
Yeah, Strider Returns was more of a, it was just awful.

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:36.200
In fact, the story that it brought up was actually retconned because of Strider 2, the

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.360
real Strider 2 that came out.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.400
And the one that came out was, I think, a worthy sequel.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:48.160
Oh, that's the Amazon level, when you fight the girls that, this is someone doing a speedrun

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.440
of the game, they use the emulator cheats though, but it's a speedrun in seven and a

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.440
half minutes.

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.000
He's fighting the half naked Amazon ladies.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Hot.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.080
All right, well there you have it, your classic game of the week Strider for the arcade and

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.280
the Genesis or Mega Drive, whatever region you happen to live in.

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.280
Check it out.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:11.720
Especially, and I would suggest this too, even though technically the Strider NES version

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.440
was not the classic game of the week, I would suggest if you've only ever played one, try

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.120
the other and just see how radically different they are for a little bit.

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.640
They are, well actually if anyone does want to check out the older one, there was a Game

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:31.600
Boy Advance release called Capcom Classics Mini Mix that had the NES version of Strider,

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.720
Bionic Commando, and Mighty Final Fight, so that's also another way that people can check

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:36.720
it out.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.720
All right, very cool.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.560
And besides that, Mighty Final Fight is just fun too.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.860
Yeah, it's kind of silly fun.

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:44.200
It's basically chibi final fight.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.600
At least it had Guy in it, right?

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.600
It did, yeah.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.600
That's why you need me.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.600
That's why I have Final Fight Guy.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.620
All right, we're going to go ahead and take a break here on Orange Laundry Radio, plenty

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:53.660
more to come in part B tonight.

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:56.880
We're going to talk about some more Grand Theft Auto news.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.880
Can you believe it?

01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:58.880
Lots of stuff.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.040
Talking about Bionic Commando Rearmed a little bit as well, and somebody dared to say that

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.520
Wii games look like crap.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.520
Who would have thought?

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:08.000
We'll talk all about that in part B right after a quick break.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.560
