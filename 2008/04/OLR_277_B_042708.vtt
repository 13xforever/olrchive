00:15.000 --> 00:19.400
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.400 --> 00:24.600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April the 27th of 2008

00:24.600 --> 00:29.600
to part B of our podcast we tape live every Sunday night at orangeloungeradio.com

00:29.600 --> 00:32.300
which is just going to refer you right over to allgames.com

00:32.300 --> 00:34.400
which is the actual radio site where we broadcast.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.000
We like people to pay attention to our own website as well

00:37.000 --> 00:40.800
because that's where the podcast is hosted which many of you are listening to right now.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.800
But of course, we also have a lot of live listeners who are assembled.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.200
If you're listening live, but you're not in chat, why not?

00:46.200 --> 00:48.800
chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be

00:48.800 --> 00:54.000
or for those of you guys on the IRC Game Surge Network, just join Channel Orange Lounge.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.600
All right, let's get back into some gaming news here in part B of our show.

00:57.600 --> 01:03.600
All right, well we've been talking about some updates coming to Burnout Paradise over the last few weeks.

01:03.600 --> 01:08.800
Recently the, I want to say it was the Bogart patch was released.

01:08.800 --> 01:13.000
Although I didn't see any of the new islands or anything like that, but maybe that's coming later.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.600
But there is another patch that they're talking about coming out later in August code named Davis.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.000
And this one's actually going to be pretty significant.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
It's going to be including, for the first time for the series, motorcycles.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.200
And then it will also have night driving as well.

01:30.200 --> 01:34.800
And the motorcycles will have actual passengers on them, which is also another first for the series

01:34.800 --> 01:38.800
because the cars are all ghost cars in Burnout Paradise normally.

01:38.800 --> 01:48.000
And the bikes will get their own modes and challenges as well as new locations designed to suit the bikes.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.600
And no word though on what they're going to do with like Showtime mode for riding a bike.

01:54.600 --> 01:58.000
Since, you know, your rider would kind of go flying through the air.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
So yeah, that's pretty awesome.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.200
I guess that's coming in August.

02:03.200 --> 02:08.200
But I'm really looking forward to the expansions for the maps whenever the hell those are going to come out.

02:08.200 --> 02:13.600
What is the obsession with motorcycles and racing games lately?

02:13.600 --> 02:16.600
Because, you know, we had Project Gotham 4, right, added them.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.800
And then we have Mario Kart, Wii is now all of a sudden got motorcycles.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.400
And now Burnout.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.800
It's like 2008 is the year of motorcycle.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.400
Well, I guess Project Gotham came out in 07.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.600
But still, it's like, you know, all the rage right now.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.200
What's up with that?

02:29.200 --> 02:30.600
I don't know, it's something different.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.600
I guess.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.600
Do you prefer motorcycle racing to car racing?

02:34.600 --> 02:36.600
I don't prefer either.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.800
I prefer, well, I'd have to say I like car better.

02:39.800 --> 02:44.600
I think motorcycle racing is much cooler when you have a stick that you beat people with off the side of the car.

02:44.600 --> 02:44.800
Road rush?

02:44.800 --> 02:45.600
Yes, exactly, road rush.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.000
Personally, I'm more of a fan of when they had Need for Speed 2.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.400
And this is not Underground 2 or anything like that.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.200
It's like the second Need for Speed game.

02:54.200 --> 03:02.200
They had, like, some crazy codes you could put in to actually race as a bunch of different, like, some of the props on the side of the road and stuff.

03:02.200 --> 03:07.400
Like, you could race as a log, you could race as an outhouse, as a giant T-Rex statue.

03:07.400 --> 03:11.200
What else was in there that was really funny?

03:11.200 --> 03:13.400
Just, like, a bunch of weird shit.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.600
And I always used to love racing the log versus the T-Rex.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.800
And I laugh like crazy.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.000
They had something similar with, I want to say Daytona as well, you could race as a horse.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.200
Now, the nighttime mode sounds cool.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.800
I like racing at night.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.800
But I think the nighttime, from what I'm looking at here, nighttime is not going to have any cars.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.000
It's just going to be empty.

03:32.000 --> 03:32.400
What?

03:32.400 --> 03:34.000
It's kind of dumb.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.600
Whatever.

03:35.600 --> 03:44.600
Alright, well, one game we love here at Orange Lounge Radio is the Eye of Judgment, which, by the way, I checked the Orange Lounge Radio wiki today.

03:44.600 --> 03:53.600
Since we have no official Wikipedia entry anymore, because some a-hole nuked it, we now have our own wiki, orangeloungeradio.wiki.com.

03:53.600 --> 04:01.600
And I was looking at the latest Eye of Judgment sales figures, which now our chatters are tracking for us, just shy of 200,000 worldwide.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.600
Never going to happen.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.600
Never going to make a million.

04:03.600 --> 04:11.600
However, for those that do happen to own Eye of Judgment, Sony is somewhat apologizing, I guess you could say, because the second set of Eye of Judgment cards...

04:11.600 --> 04:12.600
Sorry about it.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.600
Sorry about this game.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.600
But there was a second set of cards that got delayed.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.600
So three rare cards are being given away starting next Friday, but here's what I don't get.

04:20.600 --> 04:24.600
How are they rare if they're giving them away?

04:24.600 --> 04:25.600
Whatever.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.600
They're the Eye of Judgment set to promo cards.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.600
All you have to do, you watch the official PlayStation blog starting next Friday.

04:32.600 --> 04:38.600
And, oh, I see why they're rare, because you have to be one of the first few hundred who registers with the mailing list, and then you get the rarities.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.600
So only a few hundred of these are going to go out.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.600
Or...

04:42.600 --> 04:44.600
One of them will be Xeroxed and put all over the Internet.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.600
Or you could just Xerox the ones right there that are available on the website.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.600
No, no, no, here's the thing.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.600
The ones that are going around blogs, though, you've got to look at those black bars carefully.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.600
Those black bars are what the Eye of Judgment reads.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.600
They're all the same on these cards.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.600
So, not that easy, Loki.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.600
Oh, darn.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.600
I guess we'll just have to wait for one of the hundreds of people that actually...

05:01.600 --> 05:02.600
Oh, who cares?

05:02.600 --> 05:03.600
No one plays the game.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.600
It doesn't matter.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.600
Alright.

05:06.600 --> 05:12.600
Black Wolf is in chat. He actually owns Eye of Judgment. He was a big supporter of trying to move a million copies of them.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.600
He says the best part is that you have to pay $14.99 just to use those cards.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
Awesome.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.600
Since, you know, you've got to get set, too.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
Awesome. Way to support that.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
Good job.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.600
Sadly, we don't get to count expansion sales towards our million.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.600
Nope.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.600
Doesn't matter anyways.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.600
But we do get to count sales of Let's Ride Friends Forever, let's not forget.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.600
Yeah, all ten of those.

05:34.600 --> 05:39.600
Well, another game that we're not counting is Portal.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.600
Otherwise, Loki would be in that Tingle suit right now.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.600
It's a good thing we didn't count Portal.

05:45.600 --> 05:51.600
Well, basically, they have said from Valve that we will not be seeing a new Portal this year.

05:51.600 --> 06:03.600
But they are going to do a new game that is as revolutionary, they say, as Half-Life 2 was to the original Half-Life.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.600
He's quoted as saying, it won't be Portal with different colors.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.600
So, we're going to be getting something new from Valve.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.600
I say good for them.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.600
You don't want to beat this thing into the ground.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.600
You know what I mean?

06:15.600 --> 06:17.600
Sequels have so much to live up to with the originals.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.600
And granted, in gaming, we often get off a lot better than in movies.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.600
Like, you know, in movies, sequels, like 99% of the time, are crappier than the original.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.600
Once in a while, you have a rare one that's better.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.600
But in games, sometimes you get sequels that are more memorable than the original.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.600
But, you know, you don't want to rush Portal.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.600
You've got to make it right.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.600
And I'm all for new IPs.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.600
You know, Portal was a new IP when it came out.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.600
So, I'm all for new things that are just as cute.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.600
Just, you know, will it be good?

06:46.600 --> 06:49.600
Dark Tetsuya in chat suggests, Portal 2.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.600
No, really, there's cake this time.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.600
No, no, no, because the cake is made with, like, dust and...

06:56.600 --> 06:58.600
I say in Portal 2, you're going after pie.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.600
What's better than cake?

06:59.600 --> 07:00.600
Pie.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.600
There you go.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.600
I had a birthday pie.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.600
I want a birthday pie.

07:05.600 --> 07:10.600
If I can eat pie by that time, because, you know, the whole pancreas drama.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.600
But you know what's in two weeks for us?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.600
What, Margaret Cho?

07:14.600 --> 07:15.600
I know.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.600
Your birthday present is a little late.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.600
Let's get pie.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.600
If I can eat it.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.600
It might have to be low-fat Weight Watchers pie.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.600
We can eat fat-free pie.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.600
Fat-free cheesecake.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.600
I'd rather eat barf.

07:25.600 --> 07:31.600
Well, it's not cake, but it's definitely coming a lot sooner than Portal 2.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.600
It is the releases on the PlayStation Network this week.

07:35.600 --> 07:45.600
And there's some pretty interesting stuff, like the EchoChrome demo that's been released out now for, I believe, the PlayStation Portable.

07:45.600 --> 07:54.600
And you can also download some PlayStation 1 classics for R-Type, including R-Type 1 and R-Type 2.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.600
And that's available for $6.

07:57.600 --> 08:02.600
And they also have, of course, the variety map pack for Call of Duty 4 for PlayStation 3.

08:02.600 --> 08:13.600
And if you happen to be a fan of Carrique Revolution American Idol Encore, they've added a variety of new songs you can check out there as well.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.600
And let's see here.

08:15.600 --> 08:22.600
Also, of course, the Eye of Judgment Byleth Rebellion 2 expansion set is available download for $15.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.600
You know, the typical rock band stuff.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.600
Guitar Hero 3 Def Leppard pack.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.600
There's an Army of Two SSE Challenge pack.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.600
Demo for Iron Man on the PlayStation 3.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.600
Resistance Fall Man 2 teaser trailer.

08:37.600 --> 08:43.600
And then there's some other stuff from different game videos and stuff.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.600
And some free stuff.

08:46.600 --> 08:50.600
Eye of Judgment Theme number 2 for free.

08:50.600 --> 08:54.600
And the PlayStation 3 wallpaper for Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

08:54.600 --> 08:59.600
And on the PSP Store, they're actually still selling full games on there.

08:59.600 --> 09:04.600
Because, remember, you can download full PSP games, including Loco Rocco, which is $21.99.

09:04.600 --> 09:11.600
They've got, let's see here, I guess that's selling new free game.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.600
Or, well, it's not free.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.600
$21.99, that's a free deal.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.600
Free after $21.99.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.600
Free with $21.99 download fee.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.600
There's also Kingdom of Paradise, which is $10.99.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.600
So, I don't know.

09:27.600 --> 09:33.600
That kind of sucks, though, because the money that you put into the PlayStation Store and stuff like that,

09:33.600 --> 09:40.600
it's in whole dollars, so you're stuck with these remainder cents that you get ripped off on in each purchase.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.600
Way to go, Sony.

09:41.600 --> 09:50.600
Alright, well, also on the PSP soon will be Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.600
Yay!

09:52.600 --> 09:56.600
For those fans of Guilty Gear who like their wordy game titles.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.600
We went through it for Street Fighter.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.600
This is coming to the PSP.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.600
They call it the most complete and balanced version of the game to date.

10:04.600 --> 10:08.600
So, what happens is that also the game's going to have an ad hoc mode.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.600
You can do three-on-three tournaments.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.600
I guess if you have the whole wireless thing going on.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.600
So, that'd be fun.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.600
I like Guilty Gear.

10:15.600 --> 10:20.600
This information, by the way, coming from Famitsu Magazine, who is pretty reputable.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.600
So, this game is coming out for the PSP.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
So, good times.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.600
Guilty Gear in your pocket.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.600
What could possibly be better?

10:28.600 --> 10:33.600
I actually do have the Guilty Gear mini that was on Wonderswan.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
Nice.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.600
It's very, very difficult to play that.

10:38.600 --> 10:44.600
In other news, a game I don't care about, Grand Theft Auto IV.

10:44.600 --> 10:50.600
Well, you know how we were chatting about that little rumor about there being a special bundle for PS3?

10:50.600 --> 10:52.600
It's not a rumor.

10:52.600 --> 11:05.600
It's going to be released on April 29th as a 40-gig unit with a six-axis controller and stuff.

11:05.600 --> 11:10.600
And, by the way, this is the European bundle, to be specific.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.600
It will be 4.39 euro.

11:13.600 --> 11:20.600
So, if you care that much about it, go get it, I guess.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.600
Go get it, I guess.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.600
Dark Soccer Reviews Games here on Orange Launch Radio.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.600
Go get it, I guess.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.600
You should let me do more game reviews.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.600
You should play more games.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.600
We have a thing at the top of the show.

11:34.600 --> 11:38.600
Well, it's not necessarily that I'm not actually playing them.

11:38.600 --> 11:42.600
It's that other people are using the TV and playing the games.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.600
You need to regulate and say, bitch, I own half.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.600
That's why they sell, you know, monitor adapters and stuff like that.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.600
I play on my computer monitor.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.600
I don't even have a good monitor.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.600
You know what, I have that little Disney.

11:53.600 --> 11:59.600
You know what, I have this Disney princesses TV I never got a chance to use that I got for my birthday.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.600
You want to take that and hook something up to it?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.600
Okay.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.600
Look, Dan's TV.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.600
The sad thing is, I think she's serious.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.600
Well, let's see what happens.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.600
I'm all for more Dark Soccer game reviews.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.600
Well, a game I'm sure Jamie would enjoy more than Grand Theft Auto.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.600
SingStar, not yet released over here, but in Europe.

12:19.600 --> 12:26.600
The SingStar has sold its one million track and that's a lot of karaoke.

12:26.600 --> 12:37.600
They have apparently, the SingStar online store has 140,000 registered users and over 20,000 user submitted videos.

12:37.600 --> 12:42.600
None of which are of me because I don't own the game nor will ever own the game.

12:42.600 --> 12:46.600
And have been watched over 2.5 million times.

12:46.600 --> 12:54.600
The franchise has also sold 12 million copies over its multiple iterations including SingStar Bollywood.

12:54.600 --> 13:04.600
And it's due out over here next month on the 20th, I believe.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.600
Alright.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.600
So, check that out I guess.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600
SingStar, when it comes out over here.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.600
Although, Loki won't be.

13:13.600 --> 13:18.600
I think I'm going to buy it and then get Loki drunk and then see what happens.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.600
If we can get him on the TV.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.600
It might be worth it.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.600
Listeners, let's do a quick poll in chat.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.600
Quick poll, here we go.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.600
Answer the question Y or N.

13:29.600 --> 13:36.600
Is it worth the $600 investment for a Playstation 3 simply to upload Loki drunk karaoke to the interwebs?

13:36.600 --> 13:39.600
You'd also have to buy a Playstation I.

13:39.600 --> 13:43.600
Alright, is it worth the $650 adjustment or whatever?

13:43.600 --> 13:44.600
Let's throw in booze.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.600
Is it worth the $700 investment?

13:48.600 --> 13:50.600
I'm not going to do that.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.600
Answer the question.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.600
Let's see, oh, we have some answers coming in already.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.600
Let's see, we have Y, Y, N from cheeseburger.

13:57.600 --> 14:07.600
F and Y, so Y, hell fucking Y, Y, Y, well Y, Y, Y, Y, lowercase Y, I think.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.600
And then we have Dora the Explorer TV is greater than Disney Princess TV.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.600
That wasn't the question.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.600
Alright.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.600
There you go, almost 100%.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.600
Everyone except cheeseburger.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.600
Well cheeseburger, you can just sit that night out.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.600
You can go sit in the corner.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
I say N.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.600
Alright, why?

14:23.600 --> 14:24.600
Because I already have one.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.600
Alright, oh, there we go.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.600
Even better, we'll just bring yours over.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.600
And then all we have to do is buy Sing Star in a can.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.600
I want Sing Star.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.600
Loki don't glare at me.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.600
I do want Sing Star.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.600
I know, it'll be fun.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
I played it at E3.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
It'll be fun.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.600
And I sang, what's that Motorhead song?

14:40.600 --> 14:41.600
Ace of Spades.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.600
With some guy.

14:43.600 --> 14:51.600
Oh, here's what we'll do is I'll sing, but I'll make you turn around and I'll just say I'm David Cook.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.600
And then you'll get all excited.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.600
Anyhow, by the way guys, Jamie is hella into American Idol this year.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.600
It's hilarious.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.600
I...

15:04.600 --> 15:05.600
It's not funny.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.600
No, it's hilarious.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
It's great.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
Why is it funny?

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
Well they got rid of that bitch.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
Because it's cute.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
They got rid of that bitch Carly though.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.600
I like her.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
Alright, shut up right now.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.600
Shut up right now.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
Video game podcast.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.600
First of all, did you listen to her old shit?

15:19.600 --> 15:22.600
She sings so much better now than she did five years ago.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.600
Too bad.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.600
I apologize.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.600
On top of that, they said that she'd had the best performance ever.

15:26.600 --> 15:31.600
It's just a stupid fucking popularity contest, but David Cook is still going to win.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
That is true.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.600
That is because he's freaking awesome.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.600
That's it.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.600
I'm changing my cage match song.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.600
I'll give you a dollar.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.600
Alright, fine.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.600
He's great.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.600
You know what?

15:43.600 --> 15:44.600
They can all kiss my ass.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.600
We have games to talk about.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.600
It's my turn.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
Is it?

15:48.600 --> 15:49.600
Oh.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.600
Is it?

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
No.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.600
We have an international story.

15:52.600 --> 15:53.600
We do.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.600
We have an international story straight out of Singapore.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.600
They can't somebody.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.600
No, they did not cane somebody, but I don't know.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.600
They may have some type of crazy outbreak here.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
Here's the thing.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.600
There's a brand new rating system that has been announced in Singapore.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.600
You know, rating systems are overall a good thing as long as people are educated on them,

16:11.600 --> 16:14.600
but here's the kind of weak point about it.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.600
People Like Us has identified a problem with the rating system.

16:18.600 --> 16:22.600
People Like Us, by the way, is a Singapore gay and lesbian group focused on advocacy

16:22.600 --> 16:23.600
and public education.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.600
Here's the thing.

16:25.600 --> 16:31.600
If a game contains homosexuality, it is instantly an adult theme rating just because you might

16:31.600 --> 16:34.600
have some hot girl on girl action like you have in Mass Effect.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.600
Here's a quote from People Like Us.

16:36.600 --> 16:40.600
People Like Us considers this new rule unjustifiably strict.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.600
Children should not have to be kept ignorant about the presence of gay people in society

16:43.600 --> 16:47.600
any more than they should be shielded from people of other faiths and ethnicities.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.600
The path to acceptance of gay people is through teaching children and diversity from a young

16:50.600 --> 16:51.600
age.

16:51.600 --> 16:56.600
It is pejorative to love gay sexual orientation with crime and drug use, as the MDA's new

16:56.600 --> 17:00.600
guidelines do, as if gay orientation is some kind of social threat.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.600
Now, I think it goes without saying that obviously it's kind of stupid because this is the

17:04.600 --> 17:10.600
equivalent of Brokeback Mountain is automatically an NC-17 rated movie because, you know, oh

17:10.600 --> 17:12.600
my God, butt sex, right?

17:12.600 --> 17:14.600
So, here's the thing.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.600
But it's hot.

17:16.600 --> 17:22.600
Here's the thing is that, okay, the even kind of bigger issue here is that, like, are there

17:22.600 --> 17:24.600
really that many games that this is going to affect?

17:24.600 --> 17:25.600
I mean, don't get me wrong.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.600
I totally agree.

17:26.600 --> 17:30.600
It's stupid that this would be, you know, cause a game to get an adults only rating.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.600
But are there really that many games that are going to fall into this category?

17:33.600 --> 17:36.600
I mean, how many gay characters in games do we have?

17:36.600 --> 17:38.600
Sadly, not a lot.

17:38.600 --> 17:43.600
And I'm not saying that, shut up, I'm not saying that we suddenly have to get all these

17:43.600 --> 17:48.600
games to come out that have OMG, a token gay in them, or, you know, a gay lead character.

17:48.600 --> 17:53.600
But I think it would be nice if, like, you know, in an RPG or something, and I'm not

17:53.600 --> 17:57.600
talking about Enchanted Arms and that Makoto guy, okay, I'm not even talking about that.

17:57.600 --> 18:02.600
I'm talking about, I think it would be great to just see a character who just happens to

18:02.600 --> 18:07.600
be gay, and it's no big D. You know, it's just, okay, whatever, cool, right?

18:07.600 --> 18:11.600
Cause I think the nice thing about the youth of America, and, you know, I would say the

18:11.600 --> 18:15.600
youth of the world in general, and most of the countries probably listen to our show

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
anyway, is that most people kind of have that attitude.

18:17.600 --> 18:22.600
I think most young people know at least one gay or lesbian person in their real life.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.600
I mean, you know one on the internet, hello.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.600
Who?

18:25.600 --> 18:26.600
Huh?

18:26.600 --> 18:27.600
Where?

18:27.600 --> 18:29.600
You know one on the internet, but I'm saying, like, at least in their personal lives.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.600
You know, I'm just saying, I think most people are just like, whatever, it's no big deal

18:33.600 --> 18:34.600
in this day and age anymore.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.600
It's just, people are different.

18:37.600 --> 18:41.600
And I would like to see that same attitude in games, but I know there's some people that

18:41.600 --> 18:45.600
have that archaic attitude of, ew, ew, it's too gay, ew, ew.

18:45.600 --> 18:50.600
Well, you know, then don't put it in Grand Theft Auto, but there's plenty of, you know,

18:50.600 --> 18:54.600
other games that would be just fine with it.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.600
This guy's voiced the game.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
No.

18:57.600 --> 19:02.600
Uh, Saig in chat says, it's not about existing games, but it's the reason that sexuality

19:02.600 --> 19:05.600
themes are limited because of rating systems would overreact.

19:05.600 --> 19:09.600
You know, and that's kind of true too, is that how often is sexuality even a factor

19:09.600 --> 19:10.600
in games?

19:10.600 --> 19:11.600
Violence?

19:11.600 --> 19:12.600
Hell yeah, everywhere.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.600
Cursing even starts to see more and more.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
Sexuality?

19:16.600 --> 19:17.600
Not so much.

19:17.600 --> 19:26.600
Because OMG Boobs gets you an instant, you know, auto, you know, MC, MA, AO, rating.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.600
So.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.600
Uh.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.600
These people are sad.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.600
It's just silly.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.600
I would do the FUs of the Week right here, but it's just, I don't know.

19:35.600 --> 19:41.600
I mean, I, sadly it's not surprising, but I think the bigger issue is there's not a

19:41.600 --> 19:44.600
lot of games that are going to fall into this category.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.600
Why don't we work on that first?

19:47.600 --> 19:48.600
So.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.600
That's it.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.600
Now we can move on to your story, Jamie.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.600
Now it's time.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.600
Okay.

19:54.600 --> 20:03.600
The beta for Battlefield Heroes is going to be in May.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.600
That's it?

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
What the hell is Battlefield Heroes?

20:05.600 --> 20:06.600
I've never even heard of this game.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.600
It's on the 6th.

20:07.600 --> 20:14.600
It's a free-to-play cartoon sort of version of an online shooting series.

20:14.600 --> 20:18.600
The ads, it's actually funded by ads, but it's not in-game, it's on the website.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.600
Oh, so it's like a PC game?

20:19.600 --> 20:20.600
Yeah.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.600
Because I hear cartoon, I think of Wii.

20:22.600 --> 20:27.600
But I think that I had seen a little bit of it and it looks like it might be a little

20:27.600 --> 20:28.600
bit fun.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.600
So, I thought that, you know, especially anything that's free, I thought that people would

20:32.600 --> 20:34.600
be into it.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.600
So, May 6th.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.600
Beta.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
All right.

20:39.600 --> 20:43.600
Hey, I like beta and I like free games even more.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.600
Betamax.

20:44.600 --> 20:49.600
Another EA game that's getting a, well not really a beta, but a demo.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.600
A VHS?

20:50.600 --> 20:51.600
No, not a VHS.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.600
Laserdisc?

20:52.600 --> 20:53.600
No.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.600
A DVD?

20:54.600 --> 20:55.600
Spore.

20:55.600 --> 20:59.600
They're getting the Spore creature creator and demo.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.600
Those are both coming June 17th.

21:01.600 --> 21:11.600
The Spore creature creator is actually supposedly part of the, I believe there's like a SimCity

21:11.600 --> 21:13.600
pack or Sims pack coming out.

21:13.600 --> 21:18.600
That'll be a part of that as well as, well if you don't want to purchase it as part of

21:18.600 --> 21:22.600
that, you can also get the, I guess, demo for $9.99.

21:22.600 --> 21:27.600
And what the creature creator will allow you to do is create, you know, creatures obviously.

21:27.600 --> 21:31.600
You can export those creatures to wallpapers and stuff like that.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.600
So, plus I guess the creatures can be used in the full game when that actually finally

21:35.600 --> 21:36.600
comes out.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.600
You know what's kind of sad?

21:38.600 --> 21:40.600
I like forgot about Spore.

21:40.600 --> 21:45.600
Remember I was so hyped about this game after we saw that one demo at E3 in like, what,

21:45.600 --> 21:46.600
2005?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.600
I was like so hyped up for Spore, right?

21:48.600 --> 21:50.600
I kind of forgot about Spore.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.600
They might as well just rename this game Spore Chinese Democracy.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.600
It's the next PC game I'm going to buy.

21:55.600 --> 22:00.600
I mean, because I don't really, well the last game I bought, and I didn't really technically

22:00.600 --> 22:04.600
buy it because I got it for free, was Crysis.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.600
It came with my graphics card.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.600
What about Wrath of the, well I know you're not a Warcraft player.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.600
I'll probably buy Wrath of the Lich game for this.

22:10.600 --> 22:11.600
Fuck the Warcraft shit.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.600
Eh, whatever.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
Teach their own.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.600
No, I'm excited about Spore.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.600
I just kind of, sadly I forgot it was out there because the game, like, doesn't seem

22:18.600 --> 22:20.600
to ever be coming.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.600
So I don't know, I guess maybe this is a good sign that it'll be on its way.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.600
Will you check out just the creature creator?

22:25.600 --> 22:27.600
Or are you just going to be like, screw it?

22:27.600 --> 22:31.600
Uh, I think I'm just going to be like, screw it.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.600
I don't want to spoil it.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.600
Are there any PC games you're excited about, Dark Sakura?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.600
Ragnarok 2, maybe.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.600
So your games have to come from Korea.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.600
Yeah, Korea.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.600
Alright.

22:43.600 --> 22:47.600
I wouldn't mind having an updated Sonic R.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.600
Um, Rock Band is a game we all own and love and play on the internet.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.600
I was actually playing a little bit of Rock Band this week.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.600
I was playing with our webmaster VX JasonXV and Rychan.

22:57.600 --> 23:01.600
I was playing with them, and sadly, Xbox, well,

23:01.600 --> 23:04.600
Xbox was kind of having sporadic connection issues.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.600
Our game got dumped, and then like, I left to go get dinner,

23:06.600 --> 23:09.600
and then I totally got sidetracked and didn't come back until like hours later.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.600
I felt kind of bad, but you know, it's just a video game.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.600
But Rock Band's fun to play online.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.600
I need to go on and play with some listeners at some point,

23:15.600 --> 23:17.600
even though now they're all on Mario Kart Wii.

23:17.600 --> 23:22.600
But Rock Band has some new songs coming out, as they do every week.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.600
Two of the songs this week come from the same band,

23:25.600 --> 23:28.600
The Mother Hips, which are from Chico, California.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.600
I know that because I used to live there,

23:30.600 --> 23:33.600
so I think it's kind of funny that now they're having all this success through a video game.

23:33.600 --> 23:37.600
But there you have Red Tandy and Time Six Son of a Grizzly Bear from The Mother Hips.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.600
I wonder if they still play at Brickworks, I don't know.

23:40.600 --> 23:44.600
But that is coming at some point to Rock Band.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.600
That would be next Tuesday, actually.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.600
But the Smashing Pumpkins, you know them, they have a song already in the game.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.600
They have what, Cherub Rock is in the game.

23:51.600 --> 23:55.600
And now you can download Zero, which has some pretty awesome guitar.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.600
Remember that song, Zero?

23:57.600 --> 24:00.600
Although, props to you if you can sing like Billy Corgan.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.600
No.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.600
Because he's got something going on.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.600
I'm sad when a man can sing higher than me.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.600
Billy Corgan is sadly not David Cook, is he?

24:08.600 --> 24:09.600
No.

24:09.600 --> 24:10.600
All right.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.600
Let's get to the mailbag.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.600
Every week we encourage you guys to send us some e-mails.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.600
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to do it.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.600
Dark Sakura will dive into the e-mailbag every week,

24:19.600 --> 24:23.600
but she wears plastic gloves when she does it because she doesn't want anthrax poisoning.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.600
Anthrax was an 80s band, not a poison.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.600
Anthrax is great.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.600
All right.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.600
So here it is, our mailbag segment.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.600
Dark Sakura, read some e-mails.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.600
Crap, crap, crap, crap done.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.600
No, I'm kidding.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.600
We just got a lot of crap this week.

24:38.600 --> 24:42.600
No, although some underage girl wanted to show me her private pictures.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.600
Oh, damn that spam.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.600
I know.

24:45.600 --> 24:49.600
That's supposed to be coming to me.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.600
No, I'm not going to say it.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.600
Anyway, hi guys.

24:54.600 --> 25:01.600
On the show before last Rob said Live 365 idiots charged him after he sent two e-mails saying he quit.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.600
He said he would give us an update on it last week and never did.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.600
So my question is, what's going on with that?

25:07.600 --> 25:11.600
Also I have been listening since episode 150 and I still don't know why Loki hates Tingle.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.600
P.S. I attached a picture.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.600
I was bored.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.600
Misspelled.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
Who's it from?

25:17.600 --> 25:22.600
Oh, it's a little picture of Tingle with Loki's face on it and it says Loki.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.600
How wonderful.

25:23.600 --> 25:24.600
All right.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.600
And that's from I Can Ask Cheeseburger.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.600
I Can Ask Cheeseburger.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.600
Thank you.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.600
I did forget to give the Live 365 update because it's kind of funny what happened.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.600
You might remember I was really pissed because they charged my credit card

25:35.600 --> 25:38.600
and it was a little unfair of me to not give the follow up.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.600
So I apologize to them.

25:40.600 --> 25:45.600
But strangely enough that next Monday mysteriously with no e-mail.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
Well, no, I did get an e-mail.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.600
I got a little e-mail in my inbox that says,

25:49.600 --> 25:54.600
Rob, we have processed the cancellation and they refunded my credit card the entire money.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.600
Sweet.

25:55.600 --> 25:58.600
So they did not end up stealing the money for me.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.600
It was only out of my bank account for a couple of days.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.600
They borrowed it for a couple of days.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
They borrowed it for a couple of days.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.600
They poked it and did experiments.

26:04.600 --> 26:09.600
But the strange thing is we got like a little bit of kickback from our VIP listenership.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.600
The more VIPs that we had listening to us in Live 365, we got some kickback.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.600
But honestly, guys, it was nothing.

26:14.600 --> 26:20.600
I think we got like $1.37 from the month of March.

26:20.600 --> 26:24.600
So I actually got refunded that $1.37 back as well.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.600
So I actually did get a little bit of interest, I guess you could say,

26:26.600 --> 26:31.600
thanks to our VIP listeners who I do feel bad for that we're not on Live 365 anymore.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.600
But all games is where it's at, yo.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.600
It's where it's at.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.600
Get in.

26:36.600 --> 26:37.600
Live in the now.

26:37.600 --> 26:44.600
Also, Sauce says that Poison was also an 80s band, Rob.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
That is true.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.600
Anthrax is Poison and Poison was also an 80s band.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.600
That's crazy.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.600
Darktitsuiya said the exact same thing in chat.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.600
Great minds think alike.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.600
That's kind of freaky.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.600
I like what my husband says.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.600
Great minds think like us.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.600
Loki, describe your hatred of Tingle.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.600
Why is it you hate Tingle so damn much?

27:00.600 --> 27:03.600
I think he's a stupid character, that's all.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.600
He was annoying.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.600
He was annoying in Wind Waker.

27:07.600 --> 27:11.600
This fascination with everybody for me to do Tingle's voice, I don't know.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
It's just retarded.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.600
I think you actually did it one night and that's what was funny.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.600
I did it one night, yes.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.600
And that was the biggest mistake you ever made.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.600
There you go.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.600
Because people don't know when to let a joke go.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.600
All right.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.600
That joke has been going on forever.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.600
Anyway.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.600
All right, moving on.

27:25.600 --> 27:30.600
This email is from someone in Australia, I believe.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.600
So.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
Crikey.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
Hi.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.600
I've been listening for the past six months on podcasts and have been enjoying it.

27:37.600 --> 27:41.600
It breaks up the ride to and from work, so I'm not bored just looking at the window,

27:41.600 --> 27:43.600
seeing the same thing every day.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.600
I can't listen live as it's in the middle of Monday and I'm at work.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.600
Only have been live once.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.600
The changeover to all games has been good.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.600
I've noticed the upgrade in audio from the first second.

27:54.600 --> 27:59.600
Glad to see you've left dead 365.

27:59.600 --> 28:03.600
I actually do want to point out the change in audio has nothing to do with our all games move.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.600
The live change in audio, yes.

28:05.600 --> 28:10.600
The podcast change in audio was just a decision that we just did.

28:10.600 --> 28:14.600
We went through it and that is that we used to be encoded in 56K stereo.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.600
But honestly, how much music have we been playing on the show?

28:16.600 --> 28:17.600
Not a lot.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.600
So we downgraded.

28:18.600 --> 28:22.600
We actually downgraded to mono, but we went to 64K mono.

28:22.600 --> 28:27.600
There's a lot of difference there in the sound quality, so it sounds really good.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.600
I've been playing Mario Kart Wii quite a bit over the past few months,

28:30.600 --> 28:33.600
and I found out something that Rob won't like too much.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.600
Sorry to tell you, Rob, but Toadette is an unlockable character on Mario Kart Wii.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.600
God damn it!

28:39.600 --> 28:41.600
Thanks for everything and keep up the good work.

28:41.600 --> 28:47.600
Long live the ferret.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.600
That's the one I was trying to get to.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.600
King Mill is also sponsored by the Olive Garden.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.600
Unfortunately, no never-ending breadsticks here in Australia.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.600
What?

28:56.600 --> 28:58.600
Thanks is from Michael.

28:58.600 --> 29:03.600
Bobby Blackwolf's in chat, our old buddy who errors an hour before us.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.600
He is actually taking credit for the sound upgrade.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.600
He says, no, actually, all games is responsible for this change too.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.600
Don't believe Rob.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.600
We were like, you can't come unless you're in 64K mono.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.600
It's true.

29:14.600 --> 29:15.600
Rob.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.600
What?

29:16.600 --> 29:17.600
Rob.

29:17.600 --> 29:18.600
What?

29:18.600 --> 29:20.600
On May 1st, let's go to Olive Garden.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.600
I can't.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.600
I'm still on the low-fat diet until at least...

29:24.600 --> 29:25.600
You can get low-fat?

29:25.600 --> 29:26.600
Really?

29:26.600 --> 29:27.600
Yes.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.600
All right, then we can go on May 1st.

29:29.600 --> 29:33.600
I will personally look over their menu and pick out the crap that isn't fat.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.600
You can get a diet menu anywhere.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.600
That's what I've learned.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
I've been in Vegas on May 1st.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.600
All right, here we go with the Food Network again.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.600
But here's the quick thing.

29:42.600 --> 29:45.600
If the listeners that have been listening for a couple months know that I have issues in my pancreas,

29:45.600 --> 29:49.600
I'm going to pick low-fat diet because of it until at least May 9th.

29:49.600 --> 29:54.600
Here's the thing is that like part of the thing I've learned,

29:54.600 --> 29:58.600
like I went to Ruby Tuesdays this week with some of my coworkers that were visiting from L.A.

29:58.600 --> 30:01.600
and they were getting the spinach dip and the avocado dip and they were like,

30:01.600 --> 30:02.600
mmm, this is so good.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.600
I'm so sorry, Rob.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
I'm so sorry you can't eat this.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.600
So I learned that they have a diet menu.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.600
You know what I ate at Ruby Tuesdays, nice low-fat?

30:08.600 --> 30:12.600
I ate an unflavored piece of cooked chicken and broccoli.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.600
That was my dinner.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.600
Whoop-de-hoo.

30:17.600 --> 30:25.600
Well, I think that also part of, I think that, you know, possibly the,

30:25.600 --> 30:29.600
you didn't ask if it's all the fats or if it's just saturated, saturates.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
It's all fat.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.600
It's any fat.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.600
Oh, man.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.600
I can't have fat.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.600
I can't have caffeine.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.600
I can't have carbonation.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.600
You can't digest vitamin E now.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.600
It's horrible.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.600
You cannot digest vitamin E.

30:38.600 --> 30:41.600
May 5th marks one month since I got out of the hospital.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.600
But here's the thing, I had Thai food last night in San Francisco

30:44.600 --> 30:46.600
that I thought was going to be healthy for me,

30:46.600 --> 30:50.600
and I think I overindulged a little bit because my chest was hurting last night,

30:50.600 --> 30:52.600
and that's not a good sign.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.600
I'm really worried.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.600
I don't want to have this forever.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.600
All right, OL Foodio is over.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.600
Let's get back to the e-mail.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.600
Hey, give me a second.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.600
My eyes hurt.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
Orange Lounge Foodio.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
Okay.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
Hey, OLR.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.600
First off, a big F-you to Nintendo for giving a mandatory update

31:06.600 --> 31:08.600
with Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.600
I permanently have Photo Channel 1.1.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.600
This means I need to make M4A files to listen to music on Photo Channel,

31:15.600 --> 31:19.600
which means I have to delete my MP3 files for one of my favorite racing games,

31:19.600 --> 31:20.600
Excite Truck.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.600
Loki, I love the game as much as you do.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.600
You are not alone.

31:23.600 --> 31:27.600
Next, would you buy anything with the word strip before the title

31:27.600 --> 31:29.600
if it were on Xbox Live Arcade?

31:29.600 --> 31:31.600
Yes.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.600
What if it's strip mine?

31:34.600 --> 31:36.600
That's what I keep thinking of.

31:36.600 --> 31:39.600
What if it's, you know, strip racing?

31:39.600 --> 31:41.600
Or strip paint.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.600
You know, where you go to the wall and put turpentine and shit.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.600
Third, are you looking forward to any WiiWare games

31:47.600 --> 31:50.600
when the service comes out next week?

31:50.600 --> 31:53.600
I actually like Defend Your Castle way more than I ought to,

31:53.600 --> 31:56.600
so I'll probably buy Defend Your Castle on the Wii

31:56.600 --> 31:59.600
because that game is so much freaking hilarity on the PC,

31:59.600 --> 32:01.600
and yeah, I know it's been out for years.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.600
That might be.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.600
I'm looking forward to seeing the competitive one.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.600
And yes, I want the strong, bad Wii game.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.600
That's going to be hilarious, but I know that's not out at launch.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.600
That's what I want. Oh, man.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.600
Let's see.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.600
The chat room wants to let our e-mailer know.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.600
BlackWolf is saying he can just delete the 1.1 channel,

32:17.600 --> 32:19.600
and ActDeft is going to post a link in chat.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.600
There is a way you can downgrade the photo channel from 1.1.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.600
You can get rid of that if you want to go back to the old one.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.600
Probably you can Google it since you're not a live listener, it sounds like.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.600
Was this the same guy from Australia?

32:30.600 --> 32:32.600
No, this is Katamari's Forever.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.600
Oh, well, shit, Katamari's Forever I think is in chat right now.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.600
Or did they leave?

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
Oh, I think they left.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.600
Well, poor thing because they're about to get a link in chat.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.600
But if they happen to be listening to the podcast,

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
I'm sure it's out there somewhere.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.600
Shoot us a message. We'll find it.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.600
ActDeft is posting a link from Joystiq,

32:48.600 --> 32:50.600
you know, the blog with Joystiq with a Q.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.600
It was posted on December 13th of last year if you want to go find it.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.600
Just Google it. Photo channel downgrade, you'll find it.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.600
Lastly, I recently bought Night's Journey of Dreams.

33:00.600 --> 33:06.600
It's a cool and very cute game, but it suffers from simplicity.

33:06.600 --> 33:10.600
However, the voice acting is top notch and it sort of alludes to eternity's child.

33:10.600 --> 33:15.600
I hope to see you at the Olive Garden when the endless pasta deal comes back.

33:15.600 --> 33:20.600
And Night's has always been simplistic in play.

33:20.600 --> 33:25.600
However, having upgraded, you know, better voice acting is really good

33:25.600 --> 33:29.600
because the Saturn version is like, and Claris decided that she was going to go out.

33:29.600 --> 33:33.600
It's like they took one of their secretaries who just happened to speak English and say,

33:33.600 --> 33:36.600
here, do this. Okay.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.600
And yes, it had the same bad voice acting in Japan.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.600
Sadly, that's probably how it happened.

33:41.600 --> 33:42.600
Oh, yeah, I went and done it.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.600
P.S. Where did Dr. Sakura get the ferret?

33:45.600 --> 33:48.600
I haven't listened for that long and I'd like to know of its origins.

33:48.600 --> 33:49.600
Thanks again.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.600
It's not my ferret, but I have adopted it as my baby.

33:52.600 --> 33:56.600
I want to say this week on the Wikia, I posted a huge,

33:56.600 --> 33:59.600
I went to the Wikia to clear up two questions that were being asked of me.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.600
One of them was the ferret.

34:00.600 --> 34:04.600
No, the ferret article was wrong, so I went and posted a big old thing in the talk section,

34:04.600 --> 34:06.600
so you can go read that.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.600
And also on the Wikia, how OLR got its name.

34:09.600 --> 34:13.600
Dr. Tetsuya wanted me to post a thing about that, so I posted a big old thing on that,

34:13.600 --> 34:16.600
including why we named it that, and so on and so on.

34:16.600 --> 34:19.600
Oh, my God.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.600
ActDeft is also pointing a step by step.

34:21.600 --> 34:25.600
He actually went and got a bullet point list of how you downgrade the photo channel.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.600
So here it is.

34:26.600 --> 34:31.600
From the main menu, go into the Wii manual, go into the Wii button,

34:31.600 --> 34:36.600
select data management, select channels, then select photo channel 1.1.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
Confirm you want to delete it.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.600
Photo channel 1.0 will return.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.600
There you have it.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.600
Stuff.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.600
A long email.

34:45.600 --> 34:46.600
Oh, Lord.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.600
Dun, dun, dun.

34:47.600 --> 34:48.600
From who?

34:48.600 --> 34:49.600
Guess who it's from.

34:49.600 --> 34:50.600
From who?

34:50.600 --> 34:52.600
It is from Raw Steel UT.

34:52.600 --> 34:53.600
He must be listening tonight.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.600
He must have heard the thing earlier, didn't he?

34:55.600 --> 34:56.600
I don't know.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.600
All right.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.600
Well, read however much you want to.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.600
Hey, guys.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.600
Hi.

35:04.600 --> 35:08.600
I'm a girl, so you should clarify, too.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.600
Hey, guys and girl.

35:10.600 --> 35:11.600
Hi, baby.

35:11.600 --> 35:12.600
Anyway.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.600
You really wanted him to start emailing?

35:15.600 --> 35:16.600
Hey, baby.

35:16.600 --> 35:17.600
No.

35:17.600 --> 35:18.600
I was just being silly.

35:18.600 --> 35:22.600
Rob, the heat in here is giving me a freaking migraine.

35:22.600 --> 35:23.600
Look, you're sitting right by the fan.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.600
I don't know what to say.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.600
It doesn't matter.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.600
I still have a migraine.

35:26.600 --> 35:27.600
And the box fan is broke.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.600
All right.

35:28.600 --> 35:29.600
Come on.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.600
Read the email.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
He broke the box.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.600
Just because I can't get on the chat anymore doesn't mean I can't participate.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.600
Dude, unban him, okay?

35:36.600 --> 35:41.600
My official decree is to freaking unban him, so do it.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.600
Oh, snap.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.600
Now.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.600
All right.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.600
There you have it.

35:45.600 --> 35:50.600
I'd probably say more things that DMN and other game pirates don't like in these emails,

35:50.600 --> 35:51.600
but what are they going to do?

35:51.600 --> 35:52.600
Ban me?

35:52.600 --> 35:53.600
Anyway.

35:53.600 --> 36:01.600
Anyway, I wanted to start by talking about light gun games on consoles, particularly

36:01.600 --> 36:03.600
games that use limited continues.

36:03.600 --> 36:07.600
The problem with console ports of arcade shooters is that, by and large, they're very vanilla

36:07.600 --> 36:10.600
ports without much consideration for the home consoles.

36:10.600 --> 36:16.600
Obviously, you need to get the arcade mode in there, give people the option of free play,

36:16.600 --> 36:23.600
but in order to give a balanced experience that feels like it's not being made to bilk

36:23.600 --> 36:28.600
your ass for quarters, there needs to be a console-specific game mode.

36:28.600 --> 36:32.600
House of the Dead 2 and Vampire Knight had cool little mode where you could find special

36:32.600 --> 36:38.600
items that could then be equipped for use in the next playthrough.

36:38.600 --> 36:42.600
That was a cool little beginning, but since we've seen very little progress to making

36:42.600 --> 36:51.600
console-specific experiences, however, two games that have been released recently show

36:51.600 --> 36:53.600
a way for console light gun games to work.

36:53.600 --> 36:58.600
First, we have Time Crisis 4 Complete Mission Mode.

36:58.600 --> 37:03.600
In between the FPS stages, players will play through the arcade stages, but there is a

37:03.600 --> 37:05.600
difference in how they work versus the arcade mode.

37:05.600 --> 37:08.600
The player starts each stage with four units of life regardless of their health at the

37:08.600 --> 37:10.600
end of the previous stage.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.600
Upon death, the stage starts at the very beginning.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.600
They can, however, retry as many times as they like.

37:16.600 --> 37:21.600
This makes the game challenging without being a cheap exercise in credit draining.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.600
Another game is Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles.

37:24.600 --> 37:28.600
This game has a checkpoint at the center of the stage and at the final boss, and items

37:28.600 --> 37:32.600
found in the game can be used immediately or stored for later use.

37:32.600 --> 37:38.600
One can only hope that more light gun games will provide more robust experiences.

37:38.600 --> 37:41.600
Did he use robust?

37:41.600 --> 37:45.600
Because just the arcade game isn't enough.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.600
Remember, you can't spell robust without Rob.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.600
Or bust.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.600
Like Robobust.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.600
More email.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.600
More email!

37:54.600 --> 37:55.600
Fine!

37:55.600 --> 37:59.600
Next, I saw something on Kotaku regarding the obscene amount of time it takes to quit

37:59.600 --> 38:01.600
the PC versions of Assassin's Creed.

38:01.600 --> 38:04.600
It took a full minute to quit the game using the in-game menus.

38:04.600 --> 38:08.600
Granted, you can control alt-delete and quit that way, but seeing just how asinine

38:08.600 --> 38:13.600
the in-game quit ordeal is really cast doubt over Ubi's willingness to cater to the PC

38:13.600 --> 38:19.600
crowd, especially with the continued downfall of the PC as a mainstream gaming platform

38:19.600 --> 38:24.600
i.e. retail games and not ad-supported casual stuff.

38:24.600 --> 38:34.600
And it's at Kotaku.com slash 384339 slash Assassins dash Creed dash I dash can't dash quit dash U.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.600
I think that's pretty freakin' funny.

38:36.600 --> 38:42.600
Next, I have to talk about the Perfect 10 review IGN gave GTA IV, which was coincidentally

38:42.600 --> 38:45.600
an exclusive first review.

38:45.600 --> 38:51.600
First off, one has to question the ethical integrity of an exclusive review.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.600
We don't hear about exclusive music or movie previews.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.600
It just doesn't happen.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.600
Why?

38:56.600 --> 39:00.600
Because the music and movie reviews tend to have more integrity than much of the gaming

39:00.600 --> 39:02.600
enthusiast media.

39:02.600 --> 39:14.600
Indeed, I've never seen an exclusive review that wasn't a glowing puff piece for the game

39:14.600 --> 39:15.600
in question.

39:15.600 --> 39:20.600
And the reviewer in this case made it obvious, with hyperbole like calling it the best game

39:20.600 --> 39:25.600
in a decade and proclaiming it to be perfect.

39:25.600 --> 39:31.600
I can imagine the guy writing the review on his knees while his mouth was otherwise occupied.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.600
Considering Loki's criticism of the soundtrack, Jamie's complete disinterest in the boring

39:34.600 --> 39:40.600
monotony, and both Loki and Rob saying that the cheats are what make GTA fun, it really

39:40.600 --> 39:44.600
looks like Rockstar is buying reviews, or at least like many reviewers are mystified

39:44.600 --> 39:50.600
by the uber popular franchise and not wanting to believe they're even the slightest thing

39:50.600 --> 39:52.600
wrong with it.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.600
You know what, I just want to jump in here.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.600
I actually really agree with what he's saying here, because I think it is absolute bullshit

39:58.600 --> 40:03.600
that IGN gets this exclusive review, and coincidentally it gets a 10 out of 10.

40:03.600 --> 40:07.600
Now, I think we all knew Grand Theft Auto was going to get stellar reviews across the

40:07.600 --> 40:13.600
board, but quite frankly, IGN's word is tarnished, period, from this.

40:13.600 --> 40:19.600
If you get an exclusive review from a company and all this stuff, of course you're going

40:19.600 --> 40:20.600
to say good things about it.

40:20.600 --> 40:21.600
You know what I mean?

40:21.600 --> 40:23.600
Well, and I wouldn't really say that it's exclusive.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.600
I mean, a lot of people shared the 10 out of 10, and to be honest, I think the official

40:26.600 --> 40:32.600
Xbox magazine had a 10 out of 10 review way before this, but I don't know.

40:32.600 --> 40:37.600
The whole rating system is kind of skewed anyways, and really what you need to do is

40:37.600 --> 40:40.600
just ignore the ratings and just read what they write, because they'll explain in the

40:40.600 --> 40:44.600
review that it's not perfect and that there's issues and stuff, and that's really what you

40:44.600 --> 40:45.600
need to take.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.600
You don't buy your game based off of a number review.

40:47.600 --> 40:53.600
It's just like if you scored a B on a test or something, well, what's more important,

40:53.600 --> 40:56.600
the fact that you scored a B or why you scored a B on the test?

40:56.600 --> 41:00.600
I mean, that's what's more important, I would think, to an individual.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.600
And the other thing, too, is a lot of people are skewed.

41:03.600 --> 41:08.600
I mean, there's a lot of Grand Theft Auto fanboys out there, and I'll be first to say

41:08.600 --> 41:15.600
I love the game, and I absolutely think it's not perfect, but it's, I mean, what do you

41:15.600 --> 41:16.600
expect?

41:16.600 --> 41:23.600
It's basically as much of a jump from Grand Theft Auto 3 to 4 as it was from 2 to 3, and

41:23.600 --> 41:26.600
that was pretty big, so it's great.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.600
It's what it needs to go, but you know what?

41:28.600 --> 41:32.600
When they do come out with the next Vice City or whatever that is using the same engine,

41:32.600 --> 41:37.600
it's going to be that much better, so I don't know.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.600
But yeah, exclusive of anything is retarded.

41:39.600 --> 41:43.600
Well, there was more to that paragraph.

41:43.600 --> 41:47.600
The lack of balls in mainstream gaming media is frighteningly familiar to anyone who remembers

41:47.600 --> 41:52.600
the gaming industry crash of 1983, when people started buying video games in general because

41:52.600 --> 41:55.600
even shitty games were getting glowing reviews.

41:55.600 --> 42:00.600
Hopefully the growth of independent media such as All Games Radio will stem the tide

42:00.600 --> 42:04.600
of consumer distrust before the industry explodes.

42:04.600 --> 42:12.600
Lastly, while the Nintendo Wii is still selling like crazy, attach rates are still lower than

42:12.600 --> 42:16.600
either other console, and third parties are increasingly looking at the Wii as nothing

42:16.600 --> 42:18.600
more than a disposable toy.

42:18.600 --> 42:23.600
GameStop can't keep Wiis in stock, but have huge piles of accessories, and the only consistent

42:23.600 --> 42:26.600
sellers are Wii Play and Nintendo mascot games.

42:26.600 --> 42:30.600
Nintendo can make all the money they want, but they've not achieved their alleged goal

42:30.600 --> 42:32.600
of increasing the market.

42:32.600 --> 42:36.600
Some gamers still aren't buying games, and the gamers who aren't Nintendo fanboys are

42:36.600 --> 42:40.600
increasingly dissatisfied with the system, yours truly while still UT.

42:40.600 --> 42:44.600
This letter brought to you by Taco Bell, home of the never-ending diarrhea.

42:44.600 --> 42:48.600
I do agree that they haven't really expanded much beyond, because they were trying to get

42:48.600 --> 42:52.600
out of the whole rut that the GameCube is just a game for kids.

42:52.600 --> 42:58.600
Well, the fact that they're releasing kid games all across, and I...

42:58.600 --> 43:04.600
Okay, so they released Metroid Prime 3, but big deal, one game out of, you know, I don't

43:04.600 --> 43:08.600
know how many they've made, that doesn't really count.

43:08.600 --> 43:13.600
And yeah, they are targeting, you know, the casual player and stuff with these, you know,

43:13.600 --> 43:17.600
like Wii Fit, and, you know, just the Wii console, and Wii Sports and everything, and

43:17.600 --> 43:21.600
so yeah, there's a lot of people that will buy it just for Wii Sports, and that's it.

43:21.600 --> 43:25.600
And they've sold, you know, they've profited from that maybe about ten bucks, you know,

43:25.600 --> 43:29.600
because they're probably making some money off each console, but that's it.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.600
And you know, then they're getting people to buy accessories and stuff, and there's,

43:32.600 --> 43:36.600
you know, a lot of markup there too, so it's just retarded.

43:36.600 --> 43:39.600
I think it's important to remember, not that I'm trying to make excuses for the Wii, because

43:39.600 --> 43:43.600
the Wii certainly has its shortcomings, you know, especially as we've kind of moved on

43:43.600 --> 43:48.600
a year past its launch and so on, or almost two years getting there, is that the Wii doesn't

43:48.600 --> 43:53.600
lose money with every sale, whereas PlayStation 3 loses quite a bit of money, and Xbox 360

43:53.600 --> 43:57.600
I think now about breaks even, but when it was first out it was losing money too, so

43:57.600 --> 44:02.600
they have to sell more games to kind of make a profit, but Nintendo Wii, they're profiting

44:02.600 --> 44:06.600
right out the gate, so kind of like Logie says, you just buy it for Wii Sports, there's

44:06.600 --> 44:10.600
still a profit to be made, but I think as long as Nintendo puts out those, you know,

44:10.600 --> 44:14.600
one, two games a year that you just have to freaking have, the soccer moms, and I think

44:14.600 --> 44:20.600
Wii Fit is this year's, it's still going to be a big deal.

44:20.600 --> 44:26.600
So, you know, but again, it's just a different audience than the hardcore gamer, so if Nintendo

44:26.600 --> 44:32.600
wants to appeal to the hardcore gamer, I guess we get Metroid Prime 3, Mario Kart's not bad,

44:32.600 --> 44:34.600
you know, there's some of those games.

44:34.600 --> 44:38.600
I just don't think, but here's my problem with Nintendo is I don't think they get the

44:38.600 --> 44:45.600
market still, even though they may, you know, they're in theory tapping parts of the market

44:45.600 --> 44:51.600
that, you know, haven't been tapped before, like the casual gamer and stuff, maybe you

44:51.600 --> 44:55.600
shouldn't be tapping that market because it's not profitable for you, you're selling tons

44:55.600 --> 44:58.600
of consoles, but these people aren't buying, you know, games.

44:58.600 --> 45:03.600
It's also the same problem with Sony, you're selling a Playstation 3 as a Blu-ray player,

45:03.600 --> 45:08.600
well these people may not buy games either, so now you're losing money on that sale, but

45:08.600 --> 45:11.600
you're not necessarily making it up in Blu-ray sales.

45:11.600 --> 45:15.600
Keep in mind also Nintendo is a Japanese company, Microsoft is an American company, and while

45:15.600 --> 45:19.600
yes, Sony is a Japanese company as well, you kind of get the feeling that there's a little

45:19.600 --> 45:23.600
bit of tug-of-war going on between their American and Japanese arms as to, you know, who's controlling

45:23.600 --> 45:25.600
the Playstation 3, you know what I mean?

45:25.600 --> 45:30.600
So, it's something else to consider as well, because definitely you have a vastly different

45:30.600 --> 45:33.600
audience when you talk about the Japanese gaming audience, and the American gaming audience

45:33.600 --> 45:36.600
just look at any top 10 chart from a week, and there you have it.

45:36.600 --> 45:40.600
And I mean, the same I guess could be said for the DS, because the Nintendo-made games

45:40.600 --> 45:44.600
tend to sell very well, and there are, it's starting to come around for third-party stuff,

45:44.600 --> 45:48.600
and I think it's going to come around eventually for the Wii as well, because I mean the Wii's

45:48.600 --> 45:56.600
only been out for, you know, not that long, so, I mean, sure there's a ton of crappy ports,

45:56.600 --> 46:01.600
just like there was a ton of crappy Xbox ports for the Xbox 360 when it first came out, and

46:01.600 --> 46:06.600
there was a ton of crappy Playstation 1 ports for, you know, the Playstation 2 when it first came out.

46:06.600 --> 46:12.600
But it's that Fantavision. Fantavision was fun, I liked Fantavision.

46:12.600 --> 46:19.600
I don't know. But, you know, stuff will get better, and people, unfortunately, you know,

46:19.600 --> 46:23.600
people understand that there are shovelware games out there, and you know what, the best

46:23.600 --> 46:26.600
thing you can do is just not buy them, you know, granted there are stupid people that

46:26.600 --> 46:28.600
will buy them, but that's fine, that's who they're catered to.

46:28.600 --> 46:31.600
There will always be the Walmart crowd that buys them because they're cheap.

46:31.600 --> 46:35.600
Exactly, but that's fine, those companies are there, you know, it's pretty funny though,

46:35.600 --> 46:40.600
because we had some of the publishers out, and there were some publishers that deal in

46:40.600 --> 46:45.600
specifically, you know, I want to say it was Destiny, but I'm not sure, but they're a

46:45.600 --> 46:50.600
company that dealt with, like, really small games that, you know, didn't really do that

46:50.600 --> 46:54.600
well, and they understand where their market is, they understand that they're not trying

46:54.600 --> 46:58.600
to compete with, like, Grand Theft Auto, they're competing, you know, they're basically

46:58.600 --> 47:01.600
just putting them out there because they sell, and that's it.

47:01.600 --> 47:05.600
So, you know, they understand that their games aren't that quality, but they accept them

47:05.600 --> 47:09.600
for what they are, so it's just people that are dumbing to buy them.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.600
Alright, let's move on, that was the end of the email, are there any more emails?

47:12.600 --> 47:15.600
No, no, no, there were two more.

47:15.600 --> 47:16.600
Okay.

47:16.600 --> 47:23.600
Hey, OLR, Hope Sky and the Fair are okay, I just thought I'd say, since I started to

47:23.600 --> 47:27.600
listen to OLR episode 245, the show has changed so much, and you can use Studio and the

47:27.600 --> 47:31.600
All Games move, OLR just getting bigger and better, congrats.

47:31.600 --> 47:39.600
I should be live for once as I live in the UK, so keep an eye out, as it won't happen

47:39.600 --> 47:42.600
again for a while, and that's from Lichen, that's in the chat room right now.

47:42.600 --> 47:44.600
They are in chat, awesome.

47:44.600 --> 47:45.600
Last email!

47:45.600 --> 47:49.600
I just wanted to say, that person did kind of put it into perspective, there has been

47:49.600 --> 47:53.600
a lot of changes to the show just in the past year, so it's pretty exciting.

47:53.600 --> 47:57.600
Soon the world.

47:57.600 --> 47:59.600
Last email.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.600
Dun dun dun.

48:01.600 --> 48:06.600
Hi, OLR, I have been really bored because I forced myself to stop Crysis.

48:06.600 --> 48:10.600
I've been playing other games right now, like Ragnarok 2, but I think it hates Vista,

48:10.600 --> 48:16.600
what doesn't, so it gives me a BSOD, to translate a blue screen of death.

48:16.600 --> 48:21.600
I have a bit of money, so I want a PS2 game for my new PS2, and I recommend games for

48:21.600 --> 48:23.600
an RPG fan, not Kingdom Hearts, period.

48:23.600 --> 48:28.600
I already own Kingdom Hearts 1, Ace Combat 5, Tony Hawk's Project 8, Game of Pure Fail.

48:28.600 --> 48:35.600
Some PC games would do, but it can be a shooter, no Valve games, I'd rather RPGs.

48:35.600 --> 48:40.600
Honestly, Kingdom Hearts 2 is much better than Kingdom Hearts 1, but if you want RPG,

48:40.600 --> 48:45.600
give Final Fantasy X or X-2, I mean those were fairly solid.

48:45.600 --> 48:47.600
Those were good.

48:47.600 --> 48:51.600
12 was great.

48:51.600 --> 48:53.600
I played 12 and I did not like the battle system at all.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.600
There's people up and down screaming, you gotta get Persona 3.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.600
Yeah, Persona 3.

48:58.600 --> 49:05.600
Disgaea, if you like tactical games.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.600
I'm trying to think of what the new...

49:07.600 --> 49:12.600
It's not really an RPG, but the Fatal Frame games were getting some...

49:12.600 --> 49:15.600
have a little bit of a fan falling behind them too.

49:15.600 --> 49:19.600
This is from SakuraiMax, dragging misery into my life.

49:19.600 --> 49:23.600
I hope all the idiots who exist in my life would just go away.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.600
Okay, I'm not going to read the rest of that, that's emo.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.600
PS, Drip Lounge Radio.

49:27.600 --> 49:30.600
PSS Orange Lounge Radio, it's better than Crysis.

49:30.600 --> 49:33.600
Indeed, it is better than Crysis.

49:33.600 --> 49:37.600
Now we're done with emails.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.600
Yar.

49:39.600 --> 49:44.600
Oh, I got one more mention from Royal Steel UT.

49:44.600 --> 49:45.600
Oh, how long is it?

49:45.600 --> 49:46.600
Not long.

49:46.600 --> 49:47.600
Alright, hurry.

49:47.600 --> 49:51.600
Sorry guys, but with my banning from chat, I can't respond fast to the topics I like.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.600
Just some quick things though.

49:53.600 --> 49:57.600
In the US, fansubbing is still illegal as it violates the original rights holders.

49:57.600 --> 49:59.600
In this case, Japanese anime makers.

49:59.600 --> 50:05.600
Companies like Media Factory Incorporated have sent cease and desist orders to torrent sites carrying fansubs of their anime.

50:05.600 --> 50:11.600
And we've seen an increase in recent years of pre-licensed anime such as Ghost of the Shell Standalone Complex.

50:11.600 --> 50:15.600
In some cases even funded in part by US companies like ADV and Manga Entertainment.

50:15.600 --> 50:22.600
Japanese companies are obviously discontent with fansubbers as they devalue a license and are also available for Japanese users.

50:22.600 --> 50:24.600
The internet being what it is.

50:24.600 --> 50:32.600
JSRAC is a company formed by such anime companies and have frequently had problems with YouTube over the fansub content of their service.

50:32.600 --> 50:37.600
As for the sequel to Rival Schools, while it is still called Project Justice Rival Schools 2 in Latin American Europe,

50:37.600 --> 50:41.600
the subtitle Rival Schools 2 was removed from the American A.I. I knew that.

50:41.600 --> 50:47.600
Presumably not to cause controversy two years after the Columbine Massacre in Japan, it was referred to as Moru Justice Gakuen, which is what I said.

50:47.600 --> 50:53.600
And that's the name I still mostly refer to it by because I had the Japanese version for a long, long time.

50:53.600 --> 50:55.600
So yeah.

50:55.600 --> 50:56.600
Done!

50:56.600 --> 51:00.600
If you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.600
Meanwhile, more gaming news!

51:02.600 --> 51:10.600
Yes. There's going to be a brand new game. Actually, this looks pretty awesome. I've got one on order for myself and I'm not really into racing games.

51:10.600 --> 51:19.600
But, Grid, the brand new game from Codemasters. You may remember them doing Dirt, which is a pretty well accepted game.

51:19.600 --> 51:25.600
This time, you know, it's going to be all street racing and, well, street circuits and that kind of stuff.

51:25.600 --> 51:29.600
It is pretty cool though. They're going to have integration with eBay Motors.

51:29.600 --> 51:36.600
So you can actually, I guess, sell vehicles that you have created in-game through eBay.

51:36.600 --> 51:41.600
I don't know how that's actually going to work though if you're going to have to pay real money for it.

51:41.600 --> 51:47.600
It says, well, it's going to allow players to buy and sell in-game vehicles in a realistic setting.

51:47.600 --> 51:55.600
And it says also they're going to have different eBay sponsor races like the eBay Motor Muscle Series.

51:55.600 --> 52:04.600
They're going to have, let's see, some other concept cars and stuff like that with eBay stuff plastered all over it.

52:04.600 --> 52:09.600
It doesn't really say though that they're going to be using real money.

52:09.600 --> 52:13.600
So I'm not sure if it's just using eBay with some fictional money or what's going on there.

52:13.600 --> 52:19.600
God, I hope it's not real eBay. As if there wasn't enough shit on eBay. Really.

52:19.600 --> 52:22.600
You could actually probably buy shit on eBay.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.600
I could find out.

52:24.600 --> 52:30.600
No, it's probably against their terms of service, but that doesn't mean there isn't one for sale that's waiting to get taken down.

52:30.600 --> 52:35.600
I mean, once in a while I'll go on eBay and search for souls, people selling their soul on eBay.

52:35.600 --> 52:38.600
And there's usually a couple to be found even though you can't sell those.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.600
All right, moving on to something.

52:40.600 --> 52:47.600
I guess the ticket redemption industry probably sold their soul to the devil to chew real arcade games out of arcades.

52:47.600 --> 52:49.600
But I thought this was kind of interesting.

52:49.600 --> 52:58.600
There is a new bill in South Carolina that Representative Todd Rutherford has brought to light that deals with ticket redemption games and illegal gambling.

52:58.600 --> 53:01.600
But it's not what you think. Here's the thing.

53:01.600 --> 53:04.600
The sponsor of the bill, he calls it the Chuck E. Cheese bill.

53:04.600 --> 53:11.600
And what it is is that right now a game like skeeball or a type of video game, it might violate the law.

53:11.600 --> 53:18.600
However, what he wants to do is he actually wants to clearly state that these games do not violate the gambling law, that they're okay.

53:18.600 --> 53:27.600
So it's actually, you know, usually when we talk about, you know, game related bills going into effect, we're talking about some type of extreme ass hattery.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.600
But in this case, I guess it makes sense.

53:29.600 --> 53:32.600
You know, it's just kids messing around. They don't want to consider it gambling.

53:32.600 --> 53:40.600
They don't expect any opposition because, you know, the bill is simply saying that children's games at Chuck E. Cheese are not illegal.

53:40.600 --> 53:48.600
That doesn't change the fact, though, that, you know, these games at Chuck E. Cheese is one thing.

53:48.600 --> 53:53.600
But these games, having taken over my favorite arcades of yesteryear, are another.

53:53.600 --> 54:02.600
And it kind of ticks me off. I don't know about you guys, but I'm a little bit pissed off that ticket redemption games have overtaken arcades I used to know and love and shed other ones out of business.

54:02.600 --> 54:05.600
And hence, that's why I think it's time to do the FUs of the week.

54:05.600 --> 54:27.600
My FU is to these stupid people.

54:27.600 --> 54:38.600
And I know I always do talk about, you know, traffic and stupid people driving, but this couple in a big mini, it's not really mini.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.600
It's just a van.

54:40.600 --> 54:45.600
We're turning around where you cannot do a U-turn and so turned into the next street and did a wide loop.

54:45.600 --> 54:50.600
So I was like, fuck you, you have to wait since they're technically in a right hand turning lane now.

54:50.600 --> 54:54.600
And I went and honked at them quite loudly. Stupid bitch.

54:54.600 --> 54:58.600
And also FU to the heat.

54:58.600 --> 55:03.600
I mean, it's not very hot right now and it was really nice outside, but the sun specifically.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.600
FU, sun!

55:05.600 --> 55:09.600
You need to get a really big rock and throw it at the sun.

55:09.600 --> 55:11.600
Little bit of tan.

55:11.600 --> 55:15.600
Or a burn. Loki.

55:15.600 --> 55:19.600
I don't have any FUs this week.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.600
I guess.

55:21.600 --> 55:28.600
Okay, I got one. FU to Burger King for coming out with the Deluxe Steakhouse Burger.

55:28.600 --> 55:34.600
Because I understand as cool of an idea as it sounds like on paper, it really is not a very good burger.

55:34.600 --> 55:38.600
I mean, it's got, what, you know, steak, like onions.

55:38.600 --> 55:45.600
But where they go wrong with it is that it has mashed potatoes on the burger.

55:45.600 --> 55:47.600
You should do that in elementary school.

55:47.600 --> 55:49.600
That sounds nasty.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.600
If you tried it, it wasn't very good.

55:51.600 --> 55:54.600
But the Steakhouse Burger itself was good. Just don't go Deluxe.

55:54.600 --> 55:56.600
Or if you do, minus mashed potatoes.

55:56.600 --> 56:00.600
It sounds more like a Shepherd's Pie Burger.

56:00.600 --> 56:04.600
Because potatoes are good on a Shepherd's Pie, but I wouldn't...

56:04.600 --> 56:07.600
They do that with their breakfast burgers. They have one with hash browns on it.

56:07.600 --> 56:10.600
Which hash browns aren't so bad because it's got that crunchy outside to it.

56:10.600 --> 56:13.600
But mashed potatoes, it's just weird.

56:13.600 --> 56:14.600
It's not... no.

56:14.600 --> 56:18.600
I need to put my french fries on my hamburger.

56:18.600 --> 56:22.600
You cannot take a meal, put it between buns, and call it a fucking burger.

56:22.600 --> 56:23.600
It just doesn't work.

56:23.600 --> 56:25.600
If you've got this beef in there, you can.

56:25.600 --> 56:28.600
Misty, by the way, is in chat, and she's a BK expert of sorts.

56:28.600 --> 56:30.600
She says, I agree with that.

56:30.600 --> 56:34.600
Hey, I like the potatoes. It's the meat that's fucking nasty.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.600
No, the meat's not bad.

56:36.600 --> 56:38.600
Try McDonald's. That shit's horrible.

56:38.600 --> 56:42.600
Here we go again with Orange Lounge Foodio.

56:42.600 --> 56:47.600
My FU of the Week goes to my pancreas, again, for giving me problems the past few days.

56:47.600 --> 56:50.600
Specifically the cysts that I believe burst on my pancreas.

56:50.600 --> 56:51.600
Ew, I know.

56:51.600 --> 56:53.600
But think how it feels.

56:53.600 --> 56:57.600
Just a couple days ago, which caused me to have a lot of pain.

56:57.600 --> 57:00.600
And I'm still in pain today. It feels like there's a hole in my pancreas.

57:00.600 --> 57:02.600
It hurts. I hate it.

57:02.600 --> 57:05.600
And FU'd a drama in general.

57:05.600 --> 57:07.600
I'm not talking about any chat room drama that's going on or whatever.

57:07.600 --> 57:11.600
I'm talking about drama in my personal life because I had a lot of drama.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.600
I had epic drama yesterday.

57:13.600 --> 57:18.600
Epic with a capital E-P-I-C. All caps. Epic drama yesterday.

57:18.600 --> 57:21.600
It was great.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.600
And by great, I mean shitty.

57:23.600 --> 57:26.600
All right.

57:26.600 --> 57:28.600
There you have it, Chair of FUs of the Week.

57:28.600 --> 57:31.600
Let's get back to some gaming news.

57:31.600 --> 57:34.600
Yes, we must.

57:34.600 --> 57:37.600
Okay. Guess what?

57:37.600 --> 57:39.600
Arby's bought out Wendy's for real?

57:39.600 --> 57:40.600
They did?

57:40.600 --> 57:42.600
How did Arby's buy-

57:42.600 --> 57:44.600
Here we go back to Orange on Radio Fudio.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.600
Arby's bought Wendy's.

57:46.600 --> 57:48.600
Wouldn't it be the other way around? I thought Wendy's was number three.

57:48.600 --> 57:50.600
Shouldn't Wendy's buy Arby's?

57:50.600 --> 57:52.600
Arby's is nastified.

57:52.600 --> 57:56.600
Except their hash brown things are really good to dip in the cheese.

57:56.600 --> 57:59.600
So guess what?

57:59.600 --> 58:00.600
What?

58:00.600 --> 58:01.600
Home.

58:01.600 --> 58:03.600
Oh, they're trying to buy Wendy's. Sorry.

58:03.600 --> 58:05.600
Yes, home. I'm in it.

58:05.600 --> 58:11.600
The open beta is going to be in fall 2008.

58:11.600 --> 58:15.600
So the closed beta has been extended.

58:15.600 --> 58:19.600
However, Sony is going to be inviting more people to join.

58:19.600 --> 58:22.600
So maybe they'll actually update stuff in it like they said they were.

58:22.600 --> 58:28.600
How about they invite everyone to join and just release it?

58:28.600 --> 58:30.600
Because I think they're still hashing out stuff.

58:30.600 --> 58:34.600
And according to some of the updates, there haven't really been updates.

58:34.600 --> 58:37.600
They've just been sort of sitting there going la la la.

58:37.600 --> 58:41.600
This takes me back to what was it?

58:41.600 --> 58:45.600
I want to say spring of 2006 when they're like,

58:45.600 --> 58:49.600
yeah, the PlayStation 3 is coming out in spring of 2006.

58:49.600 --> 58:51.600
Oh, wait, no, it's not.

58:51.600 --> 58:54.600
It's coming out next year.

58:54.600 --> 58:57.600
And hasn't home been delayed like four times now?

58:57.600 --> 58:58.600
Yeah.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.600
And we haven't had the boomerang.

58:59.600 --> 59:02.600
Home spore forever, Duke Nukem, Chinese democracy.

59:02.600 --> 59:05.600
Come on.

59:05.600 --> 59:09.600
Well, not like we have democracy here.

59:09.600 --> 59:11.600
Anyway.

59:11.600 --> 59:14.600
But yeah, Sony delays.

59:14.600 --> 59:18.600
Hey, you unplugged me, bastard.

59:18.600 --> 59:19.600
It's all right.

59:19.600 --> 59:21.600
It just makes my monitor go slightly dimmer.

59:21.600 --> 59:23.600
Live radio.

59:23.600 --> 59:25.600
I had to get up for a minute. Sorry.

59:25.600 --> 59:31.600
So one thing that's not been delayed is any sort of sequels to Guitar Hero.

59:31.600 --> 59:34.600
And there's more rumors now coming out about Guitar Hero 4,

59:34.600 --> 59:38.600
including that, yes, they're going to jump on the rock band bandwagon,

59:38.600 --> 59:45.600
adding vocals, drums, and regular download content to the next game.

59:45.600 --> 59:48.600
One of the other things that they were saying that they want to add as well

59:48.600 --> 59:51.600
is local content from local bands.

59:51.600 --> 59:55.600
Although I'm assuming when they're saying local, that means major city local

59:55.600 --> 01:00:03.600
and not like, I don't know, Hoboken, you know.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.600
Whether this will happen or not, I'm sure we'll find out at E3.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.600
And if it does, does anyone think this is sort of copying?

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.600
I mean, do we even want to go there?

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.600
No. No other game has done this before.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:19.600
Well, good. It'll be the first.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.600
I don't know.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.600
What can they do to differentiate themselves from rock band?

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:31.600
Because you know that people are going to say something.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.600
They're, I don't know.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.600
They're going to make their drums look different.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600
Or not.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.600
Here's the thing, though.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.600
Here's the thing that is going to piss me the F off,

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.600
is that the controllers will not be compatible again.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600
Now, I'm telling you what.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.600
There is going to be hell to pay from the consumers,

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.600
and one of these games is going to be out.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.600
I mean, right now there's room for two,

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.600
but one of these games will be shut out

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.600
if they start making these controllers incompatible with each other.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.600
Mark my words.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600
Well, here's the thing. Here's the thing.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.600
The controllers were incompatible because, well,

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.600
Microsoft says all the controllers have to work with all the games, basically.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:08.600
I mean, guitar games have to work with all the guitar controllers, et cetera.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.600
So you won't ever run into that issue with the Xbox 360.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.600
Where you will run into this issue with is the Wii, PlayStation 2,

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.600
and PlayStation 3 versions, where they just say,

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.600
where Activision's like, well, you know what?

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:27.600
We're just not going to license you to use these controllers to fuck off, buy ours.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600
I don't know.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.600
It's just kind of lame.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.600
It's kind of lame, but the same, I guess.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.600
You can't just have one fighting game, one music game,

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.600
but these games are expensive.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.600
Thank you.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.600
I think it's a little too late.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.600
You have to innovate or get out.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.600
They originally were kind of trying to corner the hardcore guitar playing thing.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.600
It's kind of like In a Groove and Dance Dance Revolution,

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.600
whereas In the Groove was more technical.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.600
It was a lot harder.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.600
And they're going to do stuff like that,

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.600
whereas Rock Band's more accessible.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.600
Granted, it's really expensive to get into it,

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.600
but it's more accessible, it's easier.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.600
And one was a giant flop,

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:12.600
although you have about 100 hardcore fans that will scream and bitch

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.600
and try to tell you otherwise.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.600
Well, here's my thing.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.600
Now, harmonix is not developing the game.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.600
Is it going to be any good?

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.600
I don't know if Guitar Hero 3 was quite as good as Guitar Hero 2.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.600
I'm sure there's people who will go both ways.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.600
But the fact that they're developing entirely new stuff for it,

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.600
like some sort of singing thing and that kind of stuff,

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.600
I don't know.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.600
And we'll harmonix Sue because they're kind of ripping them off.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.600
But then again, Konami's been ripped off on all this stuff,

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.600
so I don't know.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.600
When's Konami going to do something?

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.600
That's what I want to know.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.600
They've been sitting there kind of going doo-dee-doo-doo.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.600
They realize they missed out.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.600
How do I mark a music game to the U.S.?

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600
I don't know.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.600
At least we have DDR.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.600
Oh, goody.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.600
Hey, one game I have not been playing enough of lately

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600
that I really need to go back and beat

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.600
because this game was all kinds of awesome,

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.600
and I don't know why I fell out of the habit of playing.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.600
Lost Odyssey. Awesomeness.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.600
Lost Odyssey just got some download content.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.600
Maybe that might motivate some people to give it another look.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.600
It is the triple bonus pack, and it will set you back 200 points.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.600
That's not too bad. It's about 250.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.600
The triple bonus pack has the memory lamp,

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.600
which will allow you to watch all the past event scenes again,

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.600
which is good because Lost Odyssey,

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.600
you know, high-def cutscenes, awesomeness, good times.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.600
Shattered Bond is a new antique

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.600
that adds another one of the dream sequences in The Lost Odyssey,

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.600
which you really have to kind of experience

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.600
a Lost Odyssey dream sequence.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.600
It's unlike anything we've seen in gaming for a little while since Zork.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600
This is reading.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.600
But it's cool. I can't explain it.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.600
But the stories are really good.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.600
They're really good.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.600
Whatever. You didn't play enough of it.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.600
Killer Machine is a new ring also that comes out with the game,

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600
and rings are an essential part of the game.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.600
If you play the game, you know that.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.600
So there you have it. Download content for Lost Odyssey.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.600
Also some other download content.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.600
I think, what was it? Army of Two?

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.600
Got some download content this week as well.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.600
So if you're into that game, there's some new download content

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.600
you can check out there.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.600
600 points for the SSC challenge.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.600
I have Army of Your Mom.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.600
Well, Army of Me and Your Mom would be too.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.600
You know what?

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.600
The next story makes me sad.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600
Why is that?

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.600
Well, it doesn't make me sad as far as their stance,

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.600
but it makes me sad for the industry in general.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:43.600
There is a story run in the New York Times about Stern Pinball

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.600
being the last pinball factory left in the world.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.600
And the president of the company, Gary Stern,

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.600
basically said that they're planning on sticking around

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.600
and that they expect the industry to rebound in the next ten years.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:02.600
It's basically become more of the enthusiast's market these days.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:06.600
So now that when they're selling their machines,

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.600
they're not going to arcades, they're going to people.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.600
They're going to the people who really care about the product.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.600
I just think it's sad.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.600
Damn you, Williams.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.600
I just hope it doesn't go away forever.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.600
You know what I mean?

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.600
When you hear there's only one left, it's kind of sad.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.600
Well, they've got the market.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.600
The end of an era.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.600
Hey, you know what I was reading up on that I really want to go to this year?

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.600
The spiral table they did was good.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600
California Extreme.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600
I've got to make sure I go this year.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.600
Oh, I love California Extreme.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.600
I know.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.600
Pinna-Go-Go is, I won't be going to it this year because I'll have company.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.600
Oh, sad.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.600
But Pinna-Go-Go is Memorial Day weekend.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.600
Oh, fun.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.600
I think I actually have Memorial Day weekend free this year.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.600
Oh, yeah, because Fond of May isn't happening for us this year.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.600
We're sitting out this year.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.600
So maybe I'll go to that instead.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600
We'll see.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600
Dan, where are we going?

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.600
We'll see.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.600
Penny Arcade Expo, by the way,

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.600
as long as my medical issues pull through, I'm going,

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:08.600
which means, you know, it is the last weekend in August, Seattle.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.600
I want to go.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:15.600
And, by the way, going to be a huge conglomeration of All Games podcasters there.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.600
Like, at least six different shows have representation, if not more.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.600
It's going to be pretty awesome.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.600
So, good, I hope you can go, Jamie.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.600
I hope you can talk to wife into letting you go, Loki.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.600
So, we'll see.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.600
Speaking of Loki, he's got our last story for tonight.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.600
And after that story is read, we're going to open up the Skype line,

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.600
which is available at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype,

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.600
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:42.600
Yes, when he's not butchering franchises or threatening Michael Bay to a fist fight,

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.600
Ui Bull is trying to hit up other franchises for movie options,

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.600
and one of those franchises happened to be World of Warcraft,

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:57.600
in which he, I don't know, tried to get Blizzard to allow him to create a movie for,

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.600
in which Blizzard COO Paul Sams replied,

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.600
We will not sell the movie rights, not to you, especially not to you.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.600
Bravo!

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:17.600
You know, they're worried that because it's such a success online,

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:22.600
that a bad movie would destroy that oncoming income, perhaps, or at least tarnish it.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.600
Good for Blizzard for realizing what epic mistake they would have made

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.600
if they'd let him direct this movie.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.600
So, are we sure this is actually true?

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.600
I think it is.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:34.600
You know, because part of me goes,

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.600
this seems like a fanboy might have said this or something, I don't know.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.600
So, all right, well that's going to do it for tonight's stories,

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.600
until we get to last minute stories, of which I'm sure Loki has a few of tonight.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.600
But for now, we're going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.600
our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.600
Let's go to the phones and open them up, and we've got a call.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.600
Hello, caller, are you there?

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.600
Hey, what's up, guys?

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.600
Hey, who is this?

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.600
This is Toshin from All Games and every other chat room known to man.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.600
What's up, Toshin? You listen to pretty much all the All Games shows, don't you?

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.600
I listen to a lot of them because I'm a bored person.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.600
That's all right. That's why it's there.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.600
You know, some people listen to regular radio, some people listen to All Games radio, if they're cool.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.600
Yeah.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.600
But you've been listening to All Games for ages, haven't you?

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.600
Like, you were with them back when they were, what was that other thing, pseudo or whatever they had?

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.600
Yep.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.600
Way back there. No, I actually skipped G4.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.600
Wow.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.600
But I was around back when Scott was on the East Coast and all that.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.600
Well, that's because you're in Canada, so you kind of had to skip out on G4, right?

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.600
Yeah, I've never seen anything related to G4 ever, which is probably safer.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600
Ah, you ain't missin' much.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.600
Anyhow, well, what's on your mind?

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:49.600
I've come into a new console called Xbox 360, and I was wondering if you could recommend me some stuff.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:56.600
Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 is awesome. Are you online with your Xbox 360? Have you checked out Xbox Live Arcade yet?

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:06.600
I'm actually working on that as we speak. I'm on a temporary laptop because my other PC got fried over the week, so I haven't been online much, but that's a different story.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:11.600
But as soon as I get it back, I'm going to definitely hit up Live, and I'm going to need some friends and all that kind of stuff.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600
Good times.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600
Good times.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.600
Jamie's going to recommend the Orange Box for Portal.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:21.600
I was going to say, on Xbox Live Arcade, you definitely want to get some stuff. You've got to get Geometry Wars. You've got to get...

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.600
Symphony of the Night.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:28.600
Symphony of the Night. Oh, hell yeah. You're a music game fan, right? That's what brought you to LR in the first place, right?

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.600
Yes.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.600
You've got to get Res HD. In fact...

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.600
Ooh, nice. I have that for my Dreamcast, too.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.600
In fact, we still have a code for Res HD that I never gave away.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:45.600
And now, if he just got an Xbox 360, he might be the one person who doesn't already have Res.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600
Which I don't.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.600
I might have to give Toshin the code for Res HD.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.600
So...

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.600
But, well, we have to make Toshin do something to earn it.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.600
What can we make Toshin do to earn it?

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.600
I'm on the hook, am I?

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.600
You what?

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.600
I'm on the hook, am I?

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.600
Oh, Footy Monster's complaining because he doesn't have Res either.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.600
Well, I don't know. We'll figure something out.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.600
Toshin, you and I will have a chat offline and maybe we can hook you up with Res.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.600
Maybe I'll have to make you and Footy Monster fight for it.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.600
Ooh, maybe we'll make...

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.600
I'm sure. He hits his own podcast.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:26.600
You know what we'll do? We'll make Footy and Toshin play a game next week on the show.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.600
We'll get some guests and we'll play match game. Are you going to be here next week?

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.600
Up here.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:34.600
Alright. We're going to get Toshin. I'll make Footy come next week.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.600
Footy and Toshin will play epic match game.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.600
We're going to play epic match game next week. Why is it epic?

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.600
You'll find out. I have a new idea for match game to make it epic.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.600
So we're going to play epic match game next week.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.600
Alright.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.600
He's already fucking smacked me.

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.600
Anyhow.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.600
What other types of games do you like, Toshin?

01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:00.600
I mean, I like XBLA. I've played a couple of those games.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:05.600
I like anything. I'm pretty neutral. I mean, I won't knock down a game until I've tried it.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.600
So I'm pretty open to trying anything like RPGs.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.600
If you like RPGs, you must, must, must get Lost Odyssey. It's amazing.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.600
It's not getting enough buzz out there. I don't know why.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:25.600
For classic RPG fans, if you like your old school RPGs from Super Nintendo and the Final Fantasy and stuff, you will love Lost Odyssey.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.600
Okay.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.600
Other types of games. Well, of course, Portal if you're into shooters and the Orange Box is just a great deal overall, frankly.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.600
Loki, what about my recommendation from you?

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.600
Grand Theft Auto IV.

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.600
What's that?

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.600
I keep hearing stuff about it, though.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.600
Never heard of it.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.600
Alright.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.600
I'll have to look into that one.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.600
Well, there you have some suggestions, Toshin. Good luck to you and congratulations on your purchase.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.600
I'll definitely check that out.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.600
Any last thoughts for our listeners?

01:11:53.600 --> 01:12:00.600
Um, just enjoy the weather. It's getting nice out and turn down the garage.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:06.600
It is very, very hot out here right now. We're trying to enjoy it, but it's difficult when you're cooking alive out here.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.600
So we're cooking Mama alive.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.600
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600
What was that?

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.600
Not my mom.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.600
Alright, Toshin, we gotta let you go. Take care, buddy.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.600
Alright, see you later.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.600
Bye-bye.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.600
Why is Skype acting all janky tonight?

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.600
It's acting very slow.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.600
I don't like it.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.600
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600
Hey, it's Ronma. What's up, everyone?

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:37.600
Not much, although I've gotta say Skylark is like, in chat rooms, Skylark is like jumping up and down screaming Eternal Sonata, which also was a really good game.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:45.600
And if you like more action-oriented RPGs, like not of the Kingdom Hearts caliber necessarily, it's just a great story.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.600
If you like a good story, I do recommend Eternal Sonata.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.600
Alright, what's up, Rama?

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.600
Well, a couple of things before I begin.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:58.600
I'm glad that you guys finally mentioned Video Power, because every time you mention Starrcade, I'm like,

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:05.600
I've never seen this show, and I'm the only one that's ever seen Video Power.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.600
I have never seen Video Power, but apparently Jamie has.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.600
I've seen Video Power.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.600
Really? How did I miss this show?

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:21.600
There was one episode where the kid had to Velcro a Nintendo Entertainment System box to his head, like he was running through a maze.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.600
Mm-hmm.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.600
It was funny.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.600
Good times. Were you a contestant on Video Power or something?

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:31.600
No, but believe it or not, Video Power was actually two seasons.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.600
The first season was with the kid that hosted it as a game show.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:42.600
He would come in, show the Video Power cartoon, and after the end of the show, you put up either a review or a secret code, and that was it.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:47.600
Then the second season was nothing but the game show aspect of it.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:54.600
So it started as a game advice show, and then it morphed into a game show? That's kind of weird.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:04.600
Yeah, it was sponsored by Acclaim because it was all about NARC, Quirk, Bigfoot, Arch-Vribals, all that together as a superhero team.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.600
Whatever happened to Acclaim? Are they still around?

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.600
I don't remember that.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:09.600
No, they went under.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.600
Oh, hmm. They were big back in the day.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.600
But they came back doing MMOs now.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.600
Interesting.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:25.600
Well, VidPowa, what other old school... We actually used to have a chatter named VidPowa now that I think about it. That's why I said it that way, because there was a chatter all the time that we had here.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.600
I wonder if they got his name from that.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.600
What other types of old school video game based TV shows do you remember?

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.600
I actually remembered a Qbert cartoon and Donkey Kong.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:42.600
Yes. I remember the Qbert cartoon because it had the Valley Girl sort of character on there too.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.600
Mm-hmm.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.600
That said gag me with a rocket ship.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.600
I remember a Pac-Man cartoon, but I don't remember Qbert.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.600
The Pac-Man cartoons were good too.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.600
That too.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.600
Yeah.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:57.600
I remember one year they had Pac-Man saving Santa Claus, and they played it at night, and I was so happy.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:06.600
I always wanted to go on Nick Arcade, but I never did because my parents didn't take me places where I could go on. What?

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.600
I did watch Captain In and it pissed me off.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.600
Why is that?

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.600
Because I was like, dude, these characters aren't like that. It sucks.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.600
I loved the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.600
I liked the Zelda episodes.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.600
Yes. Zelda Fridays were always awesome.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.600
That's all on DVD now.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.600
I actually did like the Super Mario World one they did too. That one was pretty cool.

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.600
Mm-hmm. Good times.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.600
And you could always do the Mario at the end of the show.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.600
All right. Enough reminiscing. Anything else you want to share with listeners, Rama?

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.600
Skye, did you get Mario Kart Wii yet?

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.600
Did you call me Scott?

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.600
No.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.600
I said Skye.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.600
I was like, wrong show.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.600
I know he's speaking New York.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.600
Did I get Mario Kart Wii yet? I did not.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.600
Yes.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.600
I haven't picked it up yet.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:49.600
Why not?

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.600
I spent the money on a new air conditioner for the garage today, so I'll probably get it this week.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.600
It's a great game. I'm loving it.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:06.600
I know. Loki had the advanced copy and we played it, so I got my fill of it, but I will buy the game because I do want to play online with other people, even if Toadette's in the game and I can't stand her.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.600
It's also Baby Peach. That's not so bad.

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.600
That's true.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.600
Loki, I want your friend code. I owe you an ass beating in Mario Kart.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.600
I'll think about it as soon as I get online when I'm stopped, you know, playing.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.600
God, you're lazy.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.600
Yeah, as soon as he can tear himself away from Grand Theft Auto IV.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.600
All right, Rama. We got to let you go to get more calls, but take care, buddy.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:27.600
All right, cool. All right. Later, guys.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.600
Later.

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:29.600
All right.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.600
I know. Good luck tearing Loki away from Grand Theft Auto IV for a few days.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:39.600
What the fuck is wrong with Skype today? It's running horribly on my end. At least the calls sound fine.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.600
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.600
Hey, what's up, guys? This is Footy Monster.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.600
Well, hello, Footy Monster. So, are you going to be here next week?

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.600
Definitely. I want that free coffee for $60.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:55.600
All right, all right. It's going to be you and Toshin duking it out in Epic Match Game. Just you wait.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.600
The gloves are off.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.600
All right.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.600
Whatever you want to call it. Yeah.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.600
All right. It's going to be good times.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.600
So, what's on your mind, Footy?

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:09.600
Well, basically, I wanted to share with you guys what I think personally is the best RPG I've played in a long time.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.600
Persona 3 again?

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:16.600
No. No. It's actually The World Ends With You for a DS that came out just last week.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.600
Ah.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:24.600
And let me tell you, it's out there with console RPGs. It's pretty fantastic.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:28.600
You know, if I wasn't in such a PSP mood this week, I would have totally bought that game.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.600
I think the soundtrack is pretty hopping.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:36.600
Describe what this game is all about because I've not seen much about it except for some of the artwork and the soundtrack.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.600
How does this game work?

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.600
Well, it has different mechanics.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.600
Let me start by saying it's a game that can be as hardcore as you want it to be,

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:51.600
but at the same time it can be as simple as you want it to be, which I think is very interesting because for portable people,

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:58.600
especially RPG players on the go, maybe they don't want to delve too much into an RPG that's super complex,

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:05.600
but yet this game allows you to make it either really complex, like for instance, Shadow Slayer plays it in a really simple way,

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:09.600
and I've played it in a super complex way in which I do much more stuff,

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.600
yet we're both enjoying it just as much, which I thought was brilliant.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.600
Interesting.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:19.600
Like, for instance, the game works on both screens at the same time and you control two characters at the same time,

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.600
one on the bottom screen and one on the top screen.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.600
On the bottom screen you control your styles to move and attack,

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:30.600
and on the top screen you move by your D-pad or if you're right-handed or left-handed with the face buttons.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:37.600
And all you do, which sounds really convoluted because you had to basically work on both planes at the same time,

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.600
but the beauty is that you can actually set the other character to move automatically if you don't want to,

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.600
or maybe automatically if you don't move it by every two seconds,

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:49.600
so that way it gives you this freedom of like, okay, do I want to be really hardcore right now,

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.600
or do I just, I'm just playing for 30 minutes and I don't want to really buzz my head in with this?

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.600
And I thought that was pretty impressive.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:00.600
Same with, on the fly, four different difficulty settings that you can change.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.600
You can go with easy, with super easy, normal, which is okay except for the blast battle,

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:08.600
hard, which is always hard, and ultimate, which is impossible, basically.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.600
You know what it reminds me of when you describe that whole character thing,

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.600
is for some reason I'm having flashbacks to Secret of Mana.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:17.600
Like, remember how you could kind of customize the second and third players that you had?

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.600
You had the girl and the little sprite guy.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.600
Like, you could kind of, you could customize the way they behaved,

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:26.600
but then, like, if you really wanted to, you just have a second person control the character.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.600
Like, you could make it a two-player game.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.600
Or if you're really hardcore, you can control them all yourself.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:35.600
Right. That's kind of the thing, only that you can't really let anyone else control it.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.600
Although I was thinking when I was playing this game with Jack,

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.600
we were thinking, dude, how awesome would it be if with Wi-Fi you could control top screen

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.600
and I could control bottom screen or, you know, vice versa.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.600
It would be so much fun.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:48.600
But this game really surprised me because I actually wrote in the audience forms

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:52.600
a small, like, super tiny paragraph that basically describes how I feel about this game.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:57.600
Because it's, I tried to wrap it out in a way that I let people call in as well,

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.600
and not, you know...

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:05.600
So, if you allow me, I would like to read that, like, it's like five lines.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.600
Sure, of course, go for it.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.600
So, I basically, what I said is,

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.600
it's far none of the best RPG I've played in a while,

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.600
at least on portables,

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.600
Mass Effect and Persona 3 take the cake on consoles for sure,

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.600
at least in what I play lightly, right?

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:22.600
I was totally hooked with the story and the impressive amount of plot twists

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.600
that never seems to be interesting, which totally surprised me because

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:30.600
I can't remember the last time a BS game or a PSP game engaged me in that way.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.600
In that way that I go, okay, I can't really put this down.

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.600
Like, Lost Odyssey could do with you.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:40.600
That kind of commitment, which I was, it blew my mind really.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.600
The game definitely must be played by any DS owner

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.600
just because it's really accessible as an RPG,

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.600
because you can tone everything down,

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.600
play easy, automatic on your partner,

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.600
and just never worry about anything by looking at the cool story,

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.600
or you can go all the way hardcore if you wanted to,

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.600
if you're a really avid RPG player.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.600
And the music, as we've heard on the break today, is amazing,

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.600
and if you haven't checked it out, you need to check it out

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.600
because it's fantastic, it's out there with Persona 3,

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.600
super modern, super upbeat,

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:12.600
it has interesting beats that I really haven't heard in RPGs in a long time,

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:16.600
because RPGs today were elves in science fiction, maybe,

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.600
and Final Fantasy, and that's it.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.600
And this modern day setting is so refreshing.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.600
Like, you are in Shibuya, that's it, no frills, no nothing.

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.600
It's just a very stylish Shibuya, that's it.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.600
You're in the middle of Tokyo.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.600
Here's one question I have about the game,

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.600
because I have to admit, one of the turn-offs for the game for me

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.600
is that it's on the DS.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:38.600
I don't like seeing these types of hardcore games on the DS,

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.600
because I don't know, maybe I'm just old-fashioned,

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:45.600
but the way I like to play my games is I like to have that big experience

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.600
on the big television and really immerse myself with everything.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.600
I feel like I can't be as immersed in the DS.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.600
DS is more like a casual game system for me,

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.600
and I know I need to kind of get over it.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.600
But do you think this game might have been better if it wasn't on the DS,

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.600
if it was on the actual console?

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.600
Well, that's the thing.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.600
That's why I'm so impressed by Square Enix here,

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.600
proving that they can do something that's not Dragon Quest

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.600
and that it's not Final Fantasy.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.600
They made a game for the DS.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.600
It is meant to be played with the DS,

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.600
and you can't play it on another system.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.600
It's that simple, which I thought was brilliant.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.600
I mean, the dual screen,

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.600
dual screens are not used to show you a map.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.600
There's action happening on both screens at the same time.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:25.600
Basically, just to explain real quick,

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.600
you're fighting enemies on the bottom screen,

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.600
and the same enemies are cloned on the top screen,

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:33.600
and it's kind of like fighting on a two-dual plane kind of battle.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.600
So if you kill someone on the bottom screen,

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.600
it dies on the top screen as well,

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.600
and they share the hit points from top to bottom,

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.600
and you and your partner share the same hit points bar.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.600
So if your partner falls,

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.600
it starts hitting out from your bottom screen life bar, basically.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.600
It's like a vertical bar.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.600
Interesting.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.600
So it's a very interesting way that they've designed it.

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.600
They've decided it in a way that,

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.600
well, man, I didn't expect it.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.600
I didn't expect Square to blow my mind,

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.600
not after what they've done lately, if you know what I mean.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.600
They haven't really been creative,

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.600
and this is creative,

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.600
which I thought was impressive.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.600
The combat system is steep.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.600
The art style, oh my God, that's great.

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:10.600
Seriously, it's not 3D,

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.600
but it's such a good 3D that doesn't make you miss 3D.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.600
Rave, rave, rave.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.600
That's all you're doing about this game,

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.600
but that's great.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.600
I'm sorry. It's really, really good.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:24.600
I didn't go into the game because it looks emo-ish,

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.600
and it's not my style.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.600
God damn it, I got into that game,

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.600
and seriously, my life was over for a week and a half.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.600
I finished the game two days ago,

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.600
and it's one of those games that I wish I hadn't played

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.600
so I could play it again.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.600
It's that kind of thing.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.600
Wow. All right.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.600
You know how Rave out Persona 3?

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.600
I never actually finished Persona 3.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.600
I got pranked out.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.600
This one, I'm not getting pranked out.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.600
And there's a lot of stuff to do after the game's over,

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.600
which I think is really interesting as well.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.600
There's a lot of stuff to do.

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.600
It's interesting because with Grand Theft Auto IV

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.600
kind of taking all the headlines this week,

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.600
it's really interesting that a game like this

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.600
might kind of slip under the radar

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.600
that people may kind of miss out on.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.600
So if you're listening to this program...

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:05.600
I'm getting GTA IV myself,

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.600
and I'm glad that I actually put the time,

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.600
since the game came out,

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.600
to play it before this game came out

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.600
because I probably would have lost it otherwise.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.600
So that's why we dedicated last week's review to that game.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.600
We did a totally in-depth review,

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.600
and I can't recommend it enough.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.600
That's why I wanted to come on your show, guys,

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.600
because I know there's a lot of RPG listeners here,

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:25.600
and you as well.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.600
I mean, you guys play RPGs as well.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.600
So I wanted you to guys...

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.600
You need to check this out before GTA comes in

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.600
and steals your lives.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600
That's what I'm saying.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.600
Too late for Loki,

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.600
but there's still hope for me and Jamie.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.600
So if you're listening to this program,

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.600
Footie demands that you put down Grand Theft Auto

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.600
and check out The World Ends With You if you own DS.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:43.600
And I will.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.600
I promise you I'll check it out soon.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.600
Good stuff.

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.600
All right.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.600
Footie, we've got to let you go take more calls,

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.600
but have a good one, okay, buddy?

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.600
No worries.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.600
See you guys later.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.600
All right, later.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.600
That was a very, very strongly worded recommendation

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600
for The World Ends With You.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.600
So, you know, I've been hearing a lot of good things

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.600
about that game.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600
I'm going to pick it up.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.600
Yeah, I think I want to too.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.600
Or I'll just wait until you get it and get sick of it

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.600
and I'll borrow yours.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.600
We'll see what happens.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.600
Okay, let's take one more call.

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.600
Why not?

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.600
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.600
Who's this?

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.600
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.600
Your fearless webmaster has arrived.

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.600
Well, hello, VXZXWQ Jason XQWV.

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:25.600
Okay, you fail.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:26.600
You're done.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:27.600
I'm just kidding.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.600
What's up?

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.600
You fail.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.600
Failed.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.600
I'm trying to decide what exactly I think of custom peripherals on the Wii.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:41.600
I caught the latter half of Bobby's show and was listening, of course,

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.600
to his complaints about the real power controls with the Mario Kart Wii wheel

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.600
and then Loki's earlier rant about the silly extensions for the baseball game

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.600
that just puts the Wii out another foot so you can crack that priceless base

01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:03.600
and kill your TV even quicker when you let go on accident and it flails away.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:07.600
There was a long, long, long ago wish list that I had

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:11.600
and one of those was Fatal Frame moving to Nintendo.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.600
I always, and I think I still do believe this,

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.600
that the best – I need to take a step back.

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.600
I'm failing.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.600
One of the things that I've always wanted to do is have a camera to play Fatal Frame

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.600
and have it translate to the character controls in game.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.600
They never did that on the PS2 or Xbox, obviously,

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.600
and apparently the fourth incarnation is coming to the Wii,

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.600
when I'm not entirely sure, but I was reading that the other day.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:49.600
And I'm just trying to decide what worth a camera clamshell would be for the Wiimote

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.600
or if it would be better as a dedicated controller

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.600
or if the whole thing is just bumpkits and you should use the normal controller anyways.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600
Here's my question.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.600
What having that extra clamshell and that extra stuff,

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.600
what exactly does that bring to the experience?

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.600
It would be the feeling.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.600
It would be the immersion.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:12.600
It would be the fact that you're not just pointing and changing channels on your TV.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:17.600
I mean, that's what the whole concept around this has been.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.600
It's been the attempt at immersion when the thing is impossible to do

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.600
or when there may be situations that prevent you from doing it, i.e.,

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:28.600
you don't golf in the rain or in the lightning storm in the snow.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.600
You don't drive off-road at 100 miles in a while.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.600
Maybe some people do, but they're just nuts.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.600
And you can't go around taking pictures of maniacal spirits that want to kill you.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.600
I've got to ask Loki what you think about that

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:46.600
because you're a big anti-Wii peripheral person.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.600
Do you think that there are some games that might justify these different peripherals

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.600
besides maybe just Wii Fit where that kind of is the game?

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:59.600
For instance, Jason's example is Fatal Frame with an actual clamshell camera.

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:05.600
Do you think that there's other types of games that maybe can justify the silly controllers?

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.600
If it uses it in an interesting way.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:13.600
I've seen some... this is kind of like the middle ground, I would say.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:17.600
There was a game called Hooked Real Motion Fishing.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.600
And what it was is it was a clamshell that held the remote in,

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.600
and then there was the reel that held the nunchuck in.

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:29.600
So you had to use the actual reel like you're reeling in a fish.

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.600
Granted, you could probably do that without the actual clamshell,

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.600
but it still was using it to something...

01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:41.600
It's not as simple as just Mario Kart pretending it's a wheel.

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:46.600
You can tilt the remote without the steering wheel attachment.

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.600
Or even worse, with the baseball thing.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:53.600
You can play Wii Baseball without having that on there.

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:57.600
People say, oh yeah, you can weight it and stuff, so it feels more natural.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.600
But yeah, then you can hit stuff and break it.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.600
But as far as if they came out with something that...

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:07.600
It would be hard for them to do it, I guess, because of the infrared and stuff.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.600
However you would do that, it would be really weird.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.600
But if they could pull it off in a way that was interesting, then maybe, yeah, that would be worth it.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.600
But a lot of these things are just...

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:24.600
It's basically aimed at the people that will only buy the Wii for Wii Sports.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:29.600
So they're like, oh hey, now I can add this tennis racket thing and it looks like I'm really playing tennis.

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:34.600
It's just for the simple-minded, I guess. I don't know.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.600
Simple-minded. Very nice.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:42.600
The bridge version of what I was going to say is that on the one hand, I love the Super Scope 6.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.600
Absolutely. Games were fantastic.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:49.600
But it was so short-lived and you can't really reuse it.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.600
But on the flip side, I just want to play Fatal Frame with the camera.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:58.600
And thinking about that, I just had what probably amounts to one of the better ideas that cost way too damn much.

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:04.600
I'm sorry, I have to interrupt and go back to the camera because the chat room is so winter.

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:08.600
They said not only could that camera be used for Fatal Frame,

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:17.600
but the clamshell camera could also be used to play the OLR dream game WhatTheyPlay.com Snap from last week's show.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:23.600
The other inspiration was Pokemon Snap 2, so believe me, I completely understand.

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.600
Winner. Sorry, Jason.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.600
All three games we found a use for the camera.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:33.600
This is probably the most infeasible thing to do for cost, but this would be freaking awesome.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:37.600
The reason why I would want a camera is I would want an external screen.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:42.600
These cameras have viewfinders, they have the LCD screen and all that kind of stuff on it.

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:50.600
It would be interesting to have a rigging where the Wiimote plugs into the Nintendo DS and the DS becomes your viewfinder.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:55.600
That way you have Fatal Frame on screen, but since you cannot at least,

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.600
they have no better way to represent this than the PS2 version,

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:01.600
you cannot see the ghost's blind eye, naked eye.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.600
You can through the viewfinder.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:09.600
With your DS, it shows you the same thing your character would be seeing in the environment based off where you're pointed on on the TV,

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:16.600
but you will only be able to see the ghost and battle it through the DS screen, at least accurately anyway.

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:22.600
That would be the funnest game I have ever played, swear to God.

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.600
But it's probably not going to happen because that's been too damn intricate.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:30.600
Too damn intricate, sadly.

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:35.600
A kid can dream, but oh man.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:42.600
I guess the end result of all this is that one-off and small-use peripherals will continue to come around,

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:46.600
they will attempt to find reuse in which they will fail, they will fade into obscurity,

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.600
and people will reminisce like we do the Super Scope.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.600
And the Virtual Boy.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:57.600
Alright, Jason, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for the call.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:58.600
Of course.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.600
Take care, buddy. And I hope you get your dream game.

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.600
Alright, bye-bye.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:06.600
That would be a very expensive setup though, but I mean, it sounds pretty cool.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.600
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight, guys.

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:11.600
Sorry to those who didn't get through, but we've got to wrap it up.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:15.600
We have kind of a long show, we still have a post-show live thing to do.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:22.600
So, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, but before I do that, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:25.600
Sure, I have a few, I guess.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:30.600
There's a game coming out that's got a great name, so I think it's worth checking it out.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:36.600
It's a RTS game called Stalin vs. the Martians.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:44.600
And basically you play Joseph Stalin, and you have to save Russia from Martians.

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:52.600
And it's kind of like a real-time strategy game, looks similar to maybe Civilization or something like that.

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:56.600
Interesting name, though.

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.600
Let's see here.

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:10.600
Apparently, our friend Lord Voldemort is on a road trip now to remove Grand Theft Auto 4 ads from US transit lines.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:16.600
And apparently he has sent emails to Miami Mayor Carlos Alvarez saying,

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:27.600
Grand Theft Auto games have been obsessively played by a number of teens who have then copy-catted the outrageous sociopathic violence in the games and killed innocent people.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:34.600
And so, he is being himself, I guess.

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.600
Now, this is actually pretty cool.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:46.600
You know how they're doing Street Fighter 2 HD, which is basically an HD remix of Street Fighter, all the stuff redrawn and stuff like that?

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:53.600
Well, there is a homebrew project being done to do something very similar to Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:54.600
Nice.

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:59.600
They're redrawing all the characters, and it looks pretty good so far, with new sprites.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:04.600
They're going to add MP3 music to it, true 3D special stages.

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:09.600
And then, I guess, a bunch more stuff.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.600
256 colors with one alpha channel and all sorts of fun.

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:13.600
I'd buy that.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.600
That sounds awesome.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:18.600
That's what the Sonic 2 on Xbox Live should have been in the first place.

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:38.600
Yeah. And then, apparently, you remember Ben Heck, his PlayStation 3 laptop that he made went up on auction and actually ended up selling for $9,000 online with all of the proceeds going to the National Cancer Coalition.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.600
Alright, at least it's a good cause.

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:48.600
Yeah, so that's pretty awesome, but if that's not good enough, he is going to be starting much like he did with the Xbox 360.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:59.600
His how-to guide, and he has the first installment in gadget right now, so you can check that out and make your own PS3 laptop if you can do that.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:03.600
And that is it.

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:07.600
Alright, then that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:12.600
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought, and I'll start tonight.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.600
My final thought is, ouch, has pain.

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:16.600
Dr. Sankar, your final thought?

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.600
Tired, hot, headache.

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.600
Loki, your final thought?

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.600
More Grand Theft Auto 4!

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.600
I'm going to Vegas this week.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.600
Ooh, lucky you. Lucky, lucky you.

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:26.600
I have to go train people.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:29.600
Thank you everybody for downloading and tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:30.600
We really appreciate your support.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:34.600
Remember, it's because of you guys that independent podcasting works.

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.600
So please, if you enjoy our show, tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:41.600
If you tell two friends about our show, then slowly but surely we can take over the world.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:46.600
And hey, leave us some nice words on podcast review sites, too, such as iTunes.

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:51.600
We could use some more five-star reviews there, or Podcast Alley, any of those places, dig.com.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.600
Any place that lists podcasts, say something nice about Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.600
It really helps to spread the word, yes, it really does work, believe it or not.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:00.600
That's going to do it for tonight.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.600
Thank you guys.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.600
Until then, next week on the program, Epic Match Game.

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.600
I promise it will be good.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:08.600
I'm Rob Roberts.

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:11.600
She's Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:12.600
