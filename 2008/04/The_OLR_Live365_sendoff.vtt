But after hours they go online and make radio the way they feel it should be these are DJs on live

00:46.160 --> 00:50.280

Wherever you are you're gonna see me fly

01:59.380 --> 02:05.380
Across the midnight sky

02:07.380 --> 02:10.380
Where were you to hold my hand

02:10.380 --> 02:13.380
To the things that we had planned

02:13.380 --> 02:16.380
Yes I need you by my side

02:16.380 --> 02:18.380
When things go crazy

02:18.380 --> 02:21.380
I just need to know you here

02:21.380 --> 02:24.380
Guarantee that you'll be there

02:24.380 --> 02:27.380
When I wake up in the night

02:27.380 --> 02:30.380
Will you be my guiding light

02:30.380 --> 02:33.380
I don't care how far I'll take a place

02:33.380 --> 02:35.380
Tonight

02:35.380 --> 02:40.380
Tell me where you are and everything's gonna be alright

02:40.380 --> 02:43.380
Like a shooting star

02:43.380 --> 02:48.380
Across the midnight sky

02:48.380 --> 02:51.380
Just to be with you tonight

02:51.380 --> 02:54.380
Like a shooting star

02:54.380 --> 02:59.380
Across the midnight sky

02:59.380 --> 03:15.380
Just to be with you tonight

03:21.380 --> 03:24.380
To a crazy friend

03:24.380 --> 03:28.380
We wrote this song specially for you

03:28.380 --> 03:30.380
It's for everything you do

03:30.380 --> 03:32.380
You are the best

03:32.380 --> 03:34.380
Now get undressed

03:34.380 --> 03:36.380
You are the cutest

03:36.380 --> 03:37.380
That's why far

03:37.380 --> 03:39.380
You took a risk

03:39.380 --> 03:41.380
And brought our disses

03:41.380 --> 03:43.380
You play it loudly in your car

03:43.380 --> 03:45.380
You tell your friends

03:45.380 --> 03:47.380
What about our band

03:47.380 --> 03:48.380
We're intimate

03:48.380 --> 03:49.380
This is what you are

03:49.380 --> 04:02.380
F-U-C-E-R

04:08.380 --> 04:11.380
When we play a show

04:11.380 --> 04:12.380
It's good to know

04:12.380 --> 04:15.380
You are in the crowd

04:15.380 --> 04:17.380
We hear you scream so loud

04:17.380 --> 04:19.380
You like to dance

04:19.380 --> 04:21.380
And take a chance

04:21.380 --> 04:24.380
So throw your undies on the stage

04:24.380 --> 04:25.380
No wait

04:25.380 --> 04:27.380
You're underage

04:27.380 --> 04:30.380
You send us e-mail everyday

04:30.380 --> 04:32.380
Sharp and touchy

04:32.380 --> 04:33.380
You make your freak

04:33.380 --> 04:34.380
So uber chic

04:34.380 --> 04:35.380
You know what they're for

04:35.380 --> 04:47.380
F-U-C-E-R

04:47.380 --> 04:48.380
You're super sperm

04:48.380 --> 04:50.380
And it's what you are

04:50.380 --> 04:51.380
So super sperm

04:51.380 --> 04:53.380
You just dance by far

04:53.380 --> 04:54.380
You're super sperm

04:54.380 --> 04:56.380
And it's what you are

04:56.380 --> 04:57.380
So super sperm

04:57.380 --> 05:08.380
So super sperm

05:08.380 --> 05:10.380
To our future fans

05:10.380 --> 05:12.380
And for our fans

05:12.380 --> 05:14.380
Do you want to join our club?

05:14.380 --> 05:16.380
We're on the road

05:16.380 --> 05:19.380
It's super sperm

05:19.380 --> 05:21.380
We'll just ask for one thing more

05:21.380 --> 05:23.380
Come see our tour

05:23.380 --> 05:25.380
You will agree

05:25.380 --> 05:27.380
Let's make a long, long, long will

05:27.380 --> 05:32.380
F-U-C-E-R

05:32.380 --> 05:33.380
You're super sperm

05:33.380 --> 05:35.380
And it's what you are

05:35.380 --> 05:36.380
So super sperm

05:36.380 --> 05:38.380
You just dance by far

05:38.380 --> 05:39.380
This is what you are

05:39.380 --> 05:47.380
F-U-C-E-R

05:47.380 --> 05:49.380
You're super sperm

05:49.380 --> 05:51.380
And it's what you are

05:51.380 --> 05:52.380
You know it oh what you are

05:52.380 --> 05:58.220
S U T E R

05:58.180 --> 06:00.960
You're super sprung, that is what you are

06:00.960 --> 06:04.400
So super sprung, Jesus plans by far

06:04.400 --> 06:07.460
You're super sprung, that is what you are

06:07.460 --> 06:10.820
So super sprung, Jesus plans by far

06:10.820 --> 06:13.840
You're super sprung, that is what you are

06:13.840 --> 06:17.040
So super sprung, Jesus plans by far

06:17.040 --> 06:20.260
You're super sprung, that is what you are

06:20.260 --> 06:22.760
So keep this ring and chain, just dance that song

06:22.760 --> 06:25.760
I know, I know, I know, I know

06:30.760 --> 06:33.760
Hey, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.760
It is the end, guys.

06:34.760 --> 06:38.760
30 minutes before we officially pull the plug on Orange Lounge Radio

06:38.760 --> 06:41.760
and five and a half years of memories on Live 365.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.760
But no tears, no crying, dammit.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.760
There's no crying in internet radio

06:45.760 --> 06:49.260
because the future begins at AllGames.com this Sunday.

06:49.260 --> 06:51.260
The new chapter of Orange Lounge Radio.

06:51.260 --> 06:53.260
But we take a look back at some of the important things

06:53.260 --> 06:54.760
that have happened over the past five years.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.260
And you gotta love this guy.

06:56.260 --> 06:58.760
He was one of the first very accessible people on it.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.260
Oh, actually, we're gonna take a quick little detour here.

07:01.260 --> 07:02.760
Somebody's calling me a little early here.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.760
We're gonna go Skype line.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.760
Hello, are you there?

07:06.760 --> 07:07.760
I'm here.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.760
Hello, how are you, Jamie?

07:10.760 --> 07:11.760
Tired.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.760
Been all day at IKEA.

07:13.760 --> 07:14.760
How was IKEA?

07:14.760 --> 07:16.760
What were you going shopping for at IKEA?

07:16.760 --> 07:18.260
It was Swedish.

07:18.260 --> 07:19.760
It was very Swedish.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.760
Were you going for meatballs or what?

07:21.760 --> 07:23.260
We actually had meatballs.

07:23.260 --> 07:26.760
And then I saw the herring and decided that it was disgusting.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.760
And I bought shelves.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.760
What are you gonna be organizing later?

07:34.260 --> 07:35.760
The computer room.

07:35.760 --> 07:36.760
Fun.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.760
It's a wreck.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.760
Sounds like fun.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.760
It's a freaking wreck.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.760
A freaking wreck.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.760
Well, hey, we're at the end, Jamie.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.760
This is 30 minutes before we pull the plug on the station.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.260
And it's all over.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.760
Are you sad?

07:50.760 --> 07:51.760
No.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.760
No?

07:54.760 --> 07:56.760
Me neither, really.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.760
We have a few people joining us.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.760
The chat is filled up a little bit.

08:00.760 --> 08:01.760
Chat.orangelaundry.com.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.760
We have a handful of people here.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.760
This is really the loyalist we have here tonight.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.760
The people that have been with us through thick and thin, through five and a half years.

08:08.760 --> 08:13.760
Do you have anything you want to say to those people as we say goodbye tonight?

08:13.760 --> 08:14.760
To our listeners?

08:14.760 --> 08:17.760
Yeah.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.760
I like fire.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.760
Always have and always will.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.760
Yeah, I can hang out on the phone for a little while.

08:24.760 --> 08:25.760
All right.

08:25.760 --> 08:29.760
We're going to ignite our flame pit and charge some melon flesh.

08:29.760 --> 08:30.760
Awesome.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.760
Sounds awesome.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.760
Well, hey, since you're on the phone, I'm gonna play a song just for you, okay?

08:35.760 --> 08:36.760
Okay.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.760
All right.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.760
This is a game.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.760
I'm doing things a little bit out of order here, but that's okay, Jamie.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
I was gonna play something else.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.760
We'll do this song.

08:44.760 --> 08:49.760
This is a song from a game, and this is a little bit newer, but this is a game that

08:49.760 --> 08:53.760
Jamie has just... She hasn't really shut up about in the past year because she just

08:53.760 --> 08:55.760
loves this game so much.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.760
It's Portal, and you gotta love this song.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.760
Bobby wants me to remind you of this, though.

09:00.760 --> 09:04.760
You know Jonathan Colton, the man who sings this song we're about to play, Still Alive?

09:04.760 --> 09:09.760
You know he also sang a song called Skullcrusher Mountain, which was once in our cage match

09:09.760 --> 09:10.760
like three years ago.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.760
No, not that long ago.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.760
Probably about two years ago.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.760
Yeah, and everybody in chat hated it.

09:15.760 --> 09:20.760
We all hated it, but now he's super famous with this Still Alive.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.760
It's kind of ironic, don't you think?

09:22.760 --> 09:24.760
His other stuff is pretty quirky, too.

09:24.760 --> 09:25.760
It is pretty awesome.

09:25.760 --> 09:26.760
All right, so here it is.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.760
We're gonna play Still Alive for our listeners, and we'll come back and dish a little more

09:29.760 --> 09:31.760
before we say goodbye tonight.

09:31.760 --> 09:35.760
This was a triumph.

09:35.760 --> 09:40.760
I'm making a note here, huge success.

09:40.760 --> 09:47.760
It's hard to upstate my satisfaction.

09:47.760 --> 09:51.760
Aperture Science.

09:51.760 --> 09:56.760
We do what we must, because we can.

09:56.760 --> 10:01.760
For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.760
But there's no sense crying over every mistake.

10:05.760 --> 10:10.760
You just keep on trying till you run above cake.

10:10.760 --> 10:22.760
And the science gets done, and you make a neat come for the people who are still alive.

10:22.760 --> 10:27.760
I'm not even angry.

10:27.760 --> 10:32.760
I'm being so sincere right now.

10:32.760 --> 10:38.760
Even though you broke my heart and killed me.

10:38.760 --> 10:42.760
I'm twirling to pieces.

10:42.760 --> 10:48.760
And through every piece came to a fire.

10:48.760 --> 10:53.760
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.760
Now these points of data make a beautiful line.

10:57.760 --> 11:02.760
And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time.

11:02.760 --> 11:15.760
So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive.

11:15.760 --> 11:19.760
Go ahead and leave me.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.760
I think I'd prefer to stay inside.

11:24.760 --> 11:31.760
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.

11:31.760 --> 11:35.760
Maybe Black Mesa.

11:35.760 --> 11:40.760
That was a joke, haha, at chance.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.760
Anyway, this cake is great.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.760
It's so delicious and moist.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.760
Look at me still talking when there's science to do.

11:49.760 --> 11:55.760
When I look up there it makes me glad I'm not you, I've experimented too long.

11:55.760 --> 12:01.760
There is research to be done on the people who are still alive.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.760
Then leave me, I'm still alive.

12:05.760 --> 12:09.760
I'm doing science and I'm still alive.

12:09.760 --> 12:13.760
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.

12:13.760 --> 12:17.760
While you're dying I'll be still alive.

12:17.760 --> 12:21.760
And when you're dead I will be still alive.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.760
Still alive, still alive.

12:24.760 --> 12:30.760
That's Jonathan Goldin here with Still Alive on OLR, the final little live show.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.760
When we're going to be pulling the plug on OLR in 23 minutes.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.760
Jamie's joining us by phone, you still there Jamie?

12:36.760 --> 12:38.760
Uh, no.

12:38.760 --> 12:39.760
You're half dead.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.760
Hey, you want to hear the latest in the Live 365 drama?

12:42.760 --> 12:43.760
This is hilarious.

12:43.760 --> 12:44.760
Do tell.

12:44.760 --> 12:48.760
I tried to send them a, oh my god, it's so hard to cancel your account with them, right?

12:48.760 --> 12:53.760
So you have to send them an email in order to cancel the account because they have no handy dandy thing on the web.

12:53.760 --> 12:57.760
So I sent them an email like on Monday, hasn't been responded to.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.760
Sent them an email like second request Thursday or Friday, still hasn't been responded to.

13:01.760 --> 13:05.760
So I'm just like great, they're going to try to charge my card tomorrow.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.760
But aha, I'm one step ahead of them.

13:07.760 --> 13:11.760
I'm going to call the bank tomorrow and put a stop pay on anything they try to do.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.760
So things are going to get ugly.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.760
Ha.

13:14.760 --> 13:19.760
Well, you've already paid for the service and they're going to try to do those to just cut it off anyway, right?

13:19.760 --> 13:20.760
Exactly, that's the thing.

13:20.760 --> 13:24.760
I don't have 85 bucks or whatever much they're going to try to charge us for another month.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.760
I don't want to be here another month.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.760
We're ready for the future, dang it.

13:28.760 --> 13:29.760
That's some crap.

13:29.760 --> 13:32.760
I know, it's such crap.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.760
The crap is the best part for it.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.760
How did you put up with this for five years?

13:38.760 --> 13:40.760
Because we were lazy.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.760
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.760
We're super lazy.

13:42.760 --> 13:46.760
Nothing is as motivating as being forced into it.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.760
True, very true.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.760
I think it's kind of part of the thing we're learning here throughout this transition.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.760
But the future of OLR is going to be very exciting.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.760
You know I got to play with the All Great Game stream yesterday.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.760
I got to hijack it for a little bit.

13:59.760 --> 14:00.760
It was lots of fun.

14:00.760 --> 14:01.760
The quality is really good.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.760
I think it's going to be a good time.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.760
Well, I've got news.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.760
What's that?

14:08.760 --> 14:14.760
They brought up a blog for that Street Fighter movie.

14:14.760 --> 14:21.760
Well, the blog was overloaded because of a lot of heavy web traffic.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.760
But they've got it back up now.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.760
It's at streetfightermovie.net.

14:26.760 --> 14:27.760
Interesting.

14:27.760 --> 14:34.760
Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li, which means I'm not going to watch it because she's my least favorite character.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.760
I'll watch it if Kylie's in it.

14:36.760 --> 14:40.760
Even if she has a cameo or is on the soundtrack, I'll still watch it.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.760
Yeah.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.760
It'll be awesome.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.760
I'm sure we'll talk more about that on Tomorrow Night Show.

14:44.760 --> 14:48.760
Also on Tomorrow Night Show, I just taped it not even 20 minutes ago.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.760
It's the reason why we started a little bit after 7 tonight.

14:51.760 --> 14:56.760
Farbs, the man who wrote Romcheck Fail is going to be on Tomorrow Night Show.

14:56.760 --> 14:57.760
It's going to be good times.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.760
Good times.

14:58.760 --> 15:03.760
And I played a whole lot of Romcheck Fail today because I had to do research for the interview.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.760
So it'll be good times.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.760
Alright, hey, we've got to squeeze in a bunch more songs.

15:08.760 --> 15:12.760
Everybody is wondering what the last song is that's ever going to be played on O.L.R.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.760
And Jamie, I hate to tell you, I've already picked it out and there's nothing you can do about it.

15:15.760 --> 15:16.760
I've already picked out the-

15:16.760 --> 15:17.760
I thought that-

15:17.760 --> 15:18.760
What?

15:18.760 --> 15:21.760
I thought we were going to do the one that we discussed because I found it.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.760
Oh, no, no, that'll be the next to last song.

15:23.760 --> 15:27.760
But then it occurred to me that there really is only one song we can go out with.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.760
There's really only one song.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.760
But that'll be the next to last song.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.760
Okay.

15:32.760 --> 15:33.760
Alright.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.760
See, even I'm keeping Jamie in suspense here.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.760
But you will approve.

15:36.760 --> 15:37.760
Trust me, you'll approve.

15:37.760 --> 15:38.760
I will?

15:38.760 --> 15:39.760
Yes, you will.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.760
Will you tell me out there?

15:40.760 --> 15:42.760
You better or I'm going to stick you with a spork.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.760
Yeah, if you join chat or something, I'll tell you.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.760
Okay.

15:46.760 --> 15:47.760
Alright.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.760
Hey-

15:48.760 --> 15:50.760
I actually don't have IRC on this computer yet.

15:50.760 --> 15:51.760
Dang you.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.760
Go to chat.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.760
I'm going to download it.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.760
Go to chat.orangehondrena.com, silly pants.

15:55.760 --> 15:56.760
I hate that client.

15:56.760 --> 15:57.760
Alright.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.760
Hey, we're going to play another song here.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.760
We're going to play some remixes here in this break.

16:02.760 --> 16:08.760
And one person we came to know and love during the OLR run on Live at 365 was Midi Head,

16:08.760 --> 16:11.760
like the first accessible DDR artist to all of us.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.760
He actually came on the show and did an interview and he was a lot of fun.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.760
So we're going to play one of his remixes right now.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.760
It's Midi Head's smack mix of Jelly Kiss.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.760
We'll be back with more at the end.

16:24.760 --> 16:53.760
See you on OLR.

16:54.760 --> 17:23.760
Bye.

17:23.760 --> 17:52.760
Bye.

17:52.760 --> 18:10.760
Jerry Kiss here on Orange Lounge Radio.

18:10.760 --> 18:15.760
Hey, you know, one of the first big whoopty-doo deal shows we ever had on Orange Lounge Radio.

18:15.760 --> 18:20.640
Do you remember when we got to premiere a brand new DDR song before anybody else did

18:20.640 --> 18:21.640
Dark Sakura?

18:21.640 --> 18:22.640
Yeah.

18:22.640 --> 18:26.640
And I'm thinking not even like we did it for some of the Xbox games a couple of years ago,

18:26.640 --> 18:31.640
but even way, way, way before that because we had buddies at Konami.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.640
We got to premiere the DDR version of Your Rain.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.640
You remember that?

18:35.640 --> 18:36.640
Yeah, I do.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.640
It was huge.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.640
We actually got some longtime listeners out of that one night.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.640
It was a huge night for us.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.640
So I thought maybe we could tip our hat and play that song.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.640
Even though you hate this remix, Jamie, it's an important part of OLR history.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.640
So I think we got to play it.

18:48.640 --> 18:55.640
Here it is.

18:55.640 --> 19:16.640
Here it is.

19:16.640 --> 19:40.640
Here it is.

19:40.640 --> 20:00.640
Here it is.

20:00.640 --> 20:22.640
I will never forget how we teased everybody with like little bits and pieces and clips

20:22.640 --> 20:24.640
of that song for like three hours.

20:24.640 --> 20:28.640
And people actually stayed to hear the whole damn thing because they're awesome.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.640
I know.

20:29.640 --> 20:30.640
That was really cool.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.640
That was an awesome night.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.640
You know, we got to figure out a way to get the old shows to the fans because we have

20:35.640 --> 20:36.640
people.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.640
I mean, I got to say, I get emails from Misty all the time.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.640
You got to let out the old shows.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.640
I don't even know if we have all the old shows.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.640
Some of them are like long gone.

20:43.640 --> 20:47.640
I know there's at least one episode that got botched archive or something that's never

20:47.640 --> 20:49.640
coming back, but a pretty good chunk of them.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.640
We're going to have to get some DVDs out there in the next year or something now that we

20:52.640 --> 20:56.640
have time since we're not managing a station 24-7 anymore.

20:56.640 --> 21:00.640
Well, hey, guess who's in chat?

21:00.640 --> 21:01.640
Hey, you're in chat.

21:01.640 --> 21:05.640
Hey, then you can see everybody there, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

21:05.640 --> 21:10.640
Hey, while you say hello to people in chat, I thought since Loki's not on the phone tonight,

21:10.640 --> 21:12.640
we need to tip our hat at the one and only Loki somehow.

21:12.640 --> 21:18.640
Little known fact about Loki, he actually was not a full-time show host when the show

21:18.640 --> 21:19.640
started.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.640
He did not join full-time until episode 20.

21:21.640 --> 21:25.640
And Jamie and I made the decision to anoint him as a host of the program because, well,

21:25.640 --> 21:26.640
he just never went away.

21:26.640 --> 21:30.640
I mean, he came to every single program, but he was very passionate and obviously has done

21:30.640 --> 21:34.640
a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of great work for OLR over the years and is just as

21:34.640 --> 21:36.640
much a part of the station as the rest of us.

21:36.640 --> 21:40.640
So I got to play a Loki remix because he's a very talented remixer.

21:40.640 --> 21:43.640
This is probably one of the most famous remixes he did over the years.

21:43.640 --> 21:44.640
So you ready for this?

21:44.640 --> 21:50.640
This is Don't Play Nice, the Zodiac Mix by Loki and Verbilicious.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.640
Oh, then don't answer your iPhone when you hear this, Jamie.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

22:23.640 --> 22:32.640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

22:53.640 --> 23:13.640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

23:23.640 --> 23:47.640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

23:47.640 --> 24:11.640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

24:11.640 --> 24:31.640
Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.

24:31.640 --> 24:47.640
Loki versus Verbilicious with Don't Play Nice, the Zodiac Mix.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.640
Eleven minutes until the plug gets pulled.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.640
We don't have a lot of time, but hey, you know,

24:52.640 --> 24:57.640
Orange Launch Radio started as a, you know, DDR, 2DX, BeatMania, Parappa,

24:57.640 --> 24:59.640
you know, all those music games.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.640
You started as a station like that.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.640
We all came together, DarkSakura, myself, and Loki.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.640
We all met playing DDR at the local arcade.

25:06.640 --> 25:09.640
I mean, literally, that is how Orange Launch Radio started.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.640
Do you remember the first time we met DarkSakura?

25:12.640 --> 25:17.640
I do, actually. Wasn't it over in Milpitas?

25:17.640 --> 25:22.640
It was. It was the day we all went to go play Para Para Paradise together.

25:22.640 --> 25:25.640
Yeah, and so Siege was there and doing his thing.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.640
That's right. Raven to the beat.

25:28.640 --> 25:37.640
Jamie, what would you say is your favorite DDR song of all freaking time?

25:37.640 --> 25:40.640
I'd have to actually say the Brilliant to You OG.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.640
Brilliant to You OG. Shit, I had something else queued up.

25:43.640 --> 25:47.640
That's all right. I can find it. I know I have it.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.640
Honestly, that's been my favorite DDR song since, like, the very beginning.

25:51.640 --> 25:55.640
What is it about Brilliant to You OG that makes it your very fav?

25:55.640 --> 25:58.640
Because I'm going to do a block here of the host's favorite DDR song,

25:58.640 --> 26:00.640
because I know Loki's, and I'll play mine too.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.640
Tell me what you did have for me.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.640
I had Love by Sonic Dream.

26:04.640 --> 26:10.640
Actually, no. I love, I adore that song, but it wasn't my favorite DDR song.

26:10.640 --> 26:13.640
That's all good. I think I have OG remixed queued up somewhere here.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.640
I just got to dig for it a little bit. Not a problem.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.640
I just thought that it was different, you know?

26:19.640 --> 26:23.640
I thought that I liked the mix itself, and the steps were a lot of fun.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.640
That's true. It was a lot of fun.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.640
Definitely one of the first Carter songs I've done.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.640
Oh my gosh, I do not have B4U Orchestral Groove. How is that?

26:30.640 --> 26:34.640
I have, like, the entire DDR Freak Radio playlist from back in the day,

26:34.640 --> 26:37.640
and somehow I don't have B4U Orchestral Groove.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.640
Well, let me see.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.640
How is that?

26:39.640 --> 26:41.640
I have it.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.640
I might have it. You know, I have the third mix.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.640
Wasn't it on third mix?

26:46.640 --> 26:49.640
I have it.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.640
I'm looking in my portable drive now.

26:52.640 --> 26:57.640
Okay, then we'll do mine and Loki's first while we dig for that,

26:57.640 --> 26:58.640
so we don't have a lot of time.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.640
I wouldn't expect you playing Love.

27:00.640 --> 27:04.640
Alright, then we might play Love, just in the interest of time,

27:04.640 --> 27:07.640
and everyone will just know for the record that Rob screwed up.

27:07.640 --> 27:11.640
Hey, what better way to end OLR than me screwing up?

27:11.640 --> 27:14.640
Here it is, Love by Sonic Dream.

27:14.640 --> 27:23.640
One of Jamie's favorite DDR songs. One of them.

27:44.640 --> 27:58.640
You're like a dream come true, I feel so beautiful.

27:58.640 --> 28:05.640
And heart and style is all those of you.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.640
Love, I've just got to have it.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.640
I believe in love.

28:11.640 --> 28:14.140
I can't be without it

28:14.140 --> 28:17.640
Come to me and make your confession

28:17.640 --> 28:20.640
Love, come let it go

28:20.640 --> 28:25.140
Love, like it's got a habit I believe in

28:25.140 --> 28:29.140
Love, I can't be without it

28:29.140 --> 28:32.640
Come to me and make your confession

28:32.640 --> 28:36.640
Love, come let it go

28:36.640 --> 28:41.640
Here comes my favorite DDR song of all time and it's from a home version

29:06.640 --> 29:13.640
Love, like it's got a habit

29:36.640 --> 29:38.640

30:12.140 --> 30:16.640
Listen to the words I'm saying baby

30:16.640 --> 30:19.140
I found my soul

30:19.140 --> 30:23.140
Let it keep me hanging on

30:23.140 --> 30:26.640
Understand me now

30:26.640 --> 30:30.140
The frequency of the beat gets higher

30:30.140 --> 30:33.140
And I'm pretty sure this song is Matt's favorite DVR song

30:33.140 --> 30:37.140
Let's move it on

30:37.140 --> 30:40.640
Let's go

30:40.640 --> 30:43.640
Go

30:43.640 --> 30:47.640
Let's go

30:59.640 --> 31:01.140
People now moving on

31:01.140 --> 31:03.140
My dreams will come true

31:03.140 --> 31:05.140
I'll be with you

31:05.140 --> 31:08.140
I just can't stop thinking of you

31:08.140 --> 31:10.140
You'll say goodbye

31:10.140 --> 31:12.140
I'll make you fly

31:12.140 --> 31:17.140
Into the deep blue sky tonight

31:17.140 --> 31:20.140
I'll do everything to please come back

31:20.140 --> 31:24.140
Into my life

31:24.140 --> 31:28.140
Come on baby I'm waiting for you

31:28.140 --> 31:31.140
Baby moving on baby baby turn me on

31:31.140 --> 31:32.640

31:32.640 --> 31:34.640
Wanna be with you

31:36.140 --> 31:40.140
Let's dance all night long baby baby moving on

31:40.140 --> 31:43.140
Baby moving on

31:47.140 --> 31:50.140
Moving on

31:50.140 --> 31:55.140
Moving on

32:00.140 --> 32:02.140
Let's go

32:02.140 --> 32:06.140
Alright it's almost that time

32:06.140 --> 32:09.140
We're like four minutes from the end or about five minutes

32:09.140 --> 32:10.140
I might go a little bit over but

32:10.140 --> 32:13.140
Jamie it's just about over

32:13.140 --> 32:15.140
I don't know what else to say

32:15.140 --> 32:16.140
What Jamie?

32:16.140 --> 32:17.140
I just said yeah

32:17.140 --> 32:19.140
Oh okay I thought you said Rob

32:19.140 --> 32:22.140
I thought you were going to do the Rob Rob Rob thing

32:22.140 --> 32:23.140
Rob

32:23.140 --> 32:24.140
What?

32:24.140 --> 32:25.140
No

32:25.140 --> 32:26.140
Alright

32:26.140 --> 32:27.140
Well we

32:27.140 --> 32:28.140
What?

32:28.140 --> 32:29.140
No

32:29.140 --> 32:30.140
Alright

32:30.140 --> 32:31.140
We promise

32:31.140 --> 32:32.140
I hate you

32:32.140 --> 32:34.140
I hate you so much

32:34.140 --> 32:36.140
What?

32:36.140 --> 32:37.140
Hi

32:37.140 --> 32:38.140
Hi

32:38.140 --> 32:40.140
You know what Jamie?

32:40.140 --> 32:42.140
It's time for you to get the F out

32:42.140 --> 32:44.140
Of Live 365

32:44.140 --> 32:47.140
No we swore that this was going to be our last song

32:47.140 --> 32:49.140
And it's not

32:49.140 --> 32:51.140
It's actually our next to last song in Live 365

32:51.140 --> 32:55.140
But it's very fitting for the end of Orange Lounge Radio

32:55.140 --> 32:58.140
It's 2 Live Crew with one of their classics

32:58.140 --> 33:01.140
So anything else you want to say about this song Jamie?

33:04.140 --> 33:08.140
I have memories of this song from my freshman year of high school

33:08.140 --> 33:09.140
I'll play it that way

33:09.140 --> 33:10.140
Awesome

33:10.140 --> 33:13.140
And we dedicate this to all the OLR listeners

33:13.140 --> 33:16.140
Who have stuck with us for five years

33:16.140 --> 33:18.140
Through thick and thin right?

33:18.140 --> 33:20.140
We dedicate it to all of you

33:20.140 --> 33:23.140
And hope you'll be able to recover from the message in this song

33:23.140 --> 33:25.140
Here it is, 2 Live Crew

33:25.140 --> 33:29.140
It's my house, and if you don't like it, get the fuck out

33:56.140 --> 33:58.140
So get the fuck out

33:58.140 --> 34:00.140

Look at you, you sorry ass, but I'm raggedy bitch

34:31.640 --> 34:35.640

34:55.140 --> 34:59.140
You're callin' all your friends on my telephone

34:59.140 --> 35:03.140
You need to leave all them bull-daggin' bitches alone

35:03.140 --> 35:07.140
I got bitches that do shit for me that you can never do bitch

35:07.140 --> 35:11.140
They suck me, fuck me, and give me money too

35:11.140 --> 35:19.140

35:19.140 --> 35:26.140

35:49.640 --> 35:57.640
You lazy ass bitch, I don't need to take this shit So get the fuck out of my motherfuckin' house

35:57.640 --> 36:05.640
Bitch, get the fuck out Bitch, get the fuck out my house

36:05.640 --> 36:13.640
It's my house, and if you don't like it, get the fuck out I don't give a fuck

Bitch, get the fuck out Bitch, get the fuck out Bitch, get the fuck out my house

36:53.640 --> 37:07.640
Catch, catch, catch, catch, catch, catch, catch, catch

37:37.640 --> 38:04.000
Well guys, here it is.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
The end.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
This is it.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
It's eight o'clock.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.760
It's time to pull the plug.

38:08.760 --> 38:12.840
It's time to say goodbye to the station we started five and a half years ago.

38:12.840 --> 38:13.840
It's time to say hello to the future.

38:13.840 --> 38:14.840
Can we set it on fire?

38:14.840 --> 38:15.840
Huh?

38:15.840 --> 38:16.840
We're still here.

38:16.840 --> 38:17.840
What?

38:17.840 --> 38:18.840
Can we set it on fire?

38:18.840 --> 38:19.840
Can we set the station on fire?

38:19.840 --> 38:20.840
God damn I wish.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.120
But no, what we're going to be doing, the reason why we're pulling the plug at eight

38:23.120 --> 38:24.120
is that we want to be cleared out.

38:24.120 --> 38:28.680
We want to be moved out by 9 Eastern and that means we're going to be purging everything

38:28.680 --> 38:32.000
from the archives because we don't want Live 365 to continue to operate our station as

38:32.000 --> 38:33.680
a VIP only thing.

38:33.680 --> 38:38.160
Everything is going to be completely wiped and officially we've merged with AllGames.com

38:38.160 --> 38:43.480
but you know I must say I'm going to miss being the overlord of my own radio station

38:43.480 --> 38:44.480
with my friends.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.540
You know, getting to take over the stream randomly.

38:46.540 --> 38:48.400
No more random bursts of Abba.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.920
It's kind of going to be sad but what can you do?

38:51.920 --> 38:53.920
That's what Justin TV swore right?

38:53.920 --> 38:54.920
Yep.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.920
And then of course you know, you never know, we might be able to twist Bobby's arm enough

38:57.920 --> 39:02.440
and maybe we get something special over at AllGames like a very fucked up Christmas from

39:02.440 --> 39:03.800
Jamie and Rob or something like that.

39:03.800 --> 39:04.800
You never know.

39:04.800 --> 39:05.800
So.

39:05.800 --> 39:06.800
So.

39:06.800 --> 39:07.800
That would be fun.

39:07.800 --> 39:12.500
I'm sorry, the chat was correct to me, it's supposed to be 9 Pacific which would be Midnight

39:12.500 --> 39:13.500
Eastern.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.720
I want to be moved out by Midnight Eastern which is only about an hour away and I have

39:16.720 --> 39:17.720
dinner planned.

39:17.720 --> 39:18.780
So this is it.

39:18.780 --> 39:19.780
The last song.

39:19.780 --> 39:23.600
I'm going to introduce it here in just a moment but Jamie, do you have any last things you

39:23.600 --> 39:25.200
want to say?

39:25.200 --> 39:29.440
Um, a couple things.

39:29.440 --> 39:30.440
Sure.

39:30.440 --> 39:38.680
Number one, Live 365, thank you for giving in to the whole RIAA scare tactic bullshit

39:38.680 --> 39:39.680
going on.

39:39.680 --> 39:42.000
That's the number one thing.

39:42.000 --> 39:52.960
Number two, I really like hamburgers and number three, cinnamon buns from Ikea are really

39:52.960 --> 39:57.400
really really tasty and smell really really really good but they're really really bad

39:57.400 --> 39:58.400
for you.

39:58.400 --> 40:03.840
And the very final thing is reject false icons.

40:03.840 --> 40:04.840
Of course.

40:04.840 --> 40:05.840
I have to name a new one.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.320
This has been my catchphrase for life.

40:07.320 --> 40:08.320
Okay.

40:08.320 --> 40:11.280
Nothing changes until you make a change.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.480
That is true.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.480
Very true.

40:13.480 --> 40:14.760
And now we're making a change.

40:14.760 --> 40:19.320
We're going to change tomorrow is when it all starts.

40:19.320 --> 40:20.320
This is kind of sad.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
It's a sad moment.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.640
It's happy and it's sad, you know what I mean?

40:23.640 --> 40:27.080
Like I feel bad for all the folks that have really supported us over five and a half years

40:27.080 --> 40:28.520
of internet radio.

40:28.520 --> 40:33.740
I know the show, the music and all that stuff is going away, but you know, obviously the

40:33.740 --> 40:34.960
show is still going to be there.

40:34.960 --> 40:35.960
We're still going to be there.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.240
The community is still going to be there.

40:37.240 --> 40:39.280
The oil army is still going to be there.

40:39.280 --> 40:42.680
Nothing is really going away except our stream.

40:42.680 --> 40:45.920
And as we merge into Voltron, what's that?

40:45.920 --> 40:47.280
We're starting over.

40:47.280 --> 40:51.080
We are starting over indeed, truer words.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.400
So that's it.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.200
I just want to say thank you to everybody in chat right now.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.600
Everybody who couldn't be here tonight, but wanted to be everybody that supported us for

40:58.600 --> 40:59.600
five and a half years.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.360
And please continue to support us in the future.

41:02.360 --> 41:07.400
That's going to bring us to the last song and Jamie, do you want me to hang up or just

41:07.400 --> 41:09.040
keep you on through this?

41:09.040 --> 41:10.040
I'll stay on.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.040
Okay.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.040
This is what's going to happen folks.

41:12.040 --> 41:15.840
I'm going to play the last song, which you know, after thinking long and hard, we wanted

41:15.840 --> 41:21.680
to pick one song that really just encompassed everything that Orange Lounge Radio in the

41:21.680 --> 41:22.680
past five and a half years.

41:22.680 --> 41:26.080
If you could just sum it up into one song, this is it.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.680
So we're going to play this and then that's it.

41:28.680 --> 41:32.720
You're going to hear silence and then you're going to hear the stream get cut and that's

41:32.720 --> 41:33.840
the end.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.600
So that's it.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.120
Any last, last, last things, Jamie, because this is really it.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.640
We're not saying anything after the song.

41:40.640 --> 41:41.640
It's over.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.600
The plug's getting pulled.

41:43.600 --> 41:51.360
I guess I hope you all have been listening to.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.360
Absolutely.

41:52.360 --> 41:58.280
You know that Herring Row I was talking about earlier?

41:58.280 --> 42:00.280
The brand is ABBA.

42:00.280 --> 42:01.280
Awesome.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.280
All right.

42:02.280 --> 42:05.520
So you have candidates, that's us.

42:05.520 --> 42:08.600
You will keep going on with randomness as long as I let you.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.600
Yes I will.

42:09.600 --> 42:10.600
Okay.

42:10.600 --> 42:11.600
Play the damn song.

42:11.600 --> 42:12.600
All right.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.080
Group hug and chat everybody.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.080
Here it is.

42:15.080 --> 42:17.140
The last song and then the plug getting pulled.

42:17.140 --> 42:20.520
Thank you for myself, Dark Sakura, Loki, everybody.

42:20.520 --> 42:24.020
Thank you for your support of Orange Lounge Radio.

42:24.020 --> 42:25.240
We are starting over.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.480
We'll see you tomorrow night at AllGames.com.

42:27.480 --> 42:52.000
Good night everybody.

42:57.480 --> 43:25.480
Good night.

43:25.480 --> 43:53.960
Good night.

43:55.480 --> 44:21.960
Good night.

44:21.960 --> 44:43.440
Good night.

44:51.960 --> 45:17.440
Good night.

45:17.440 --> 45:42.920
Good night.
