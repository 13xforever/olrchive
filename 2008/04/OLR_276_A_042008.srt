00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:26,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, April 20th, 2008, Rock Band is set to get its first full albums, Soul Calibur the original is headed to Xbox Live Arcade, and did a recent video game release borrow its box art from the internet?

2
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:42,541
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:47,767
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:48,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

6
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:49,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are you, Jamie?

7
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little tired.

8
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:53,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to hear about the tiredness.

9
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you're quiet and you seem like your energy is depleted a little bit.

10
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:01,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, happy late birthday to you, Miss Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:06,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this weekend was your birthday and I guess you're just too exhausted from all the partying, huh?

12
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:16,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to San Francisco for Sakura Matsuri and I was very sad because it was so windy that all the blossoms had been blown off of the trees except for a few.

13
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:17,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no.

14
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:23,124
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did a lot of shopping and they changed Kinokuniya.

15
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:28,632
[SPEAKER_05]: That has a whole anime, manga stuff section downstairs.

16
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:29,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

17
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:37,465
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where all the fanboys were, but that's also where all the Copic markers and deleter pads were, so I had to go down there.

18
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:39,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed you brought back a video game magazine all in Japanese.

19
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:40,906
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Famitsu magazine.

20
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:42,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought back last month's issue of Famitsu.

21
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:43,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

22
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:49,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And I brought back the first issue of the Blue Dragon manga, which is interesting.

23
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:52,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was thumbing through it and I'm like, this looks to have nothing in common with the video games.

24
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,711
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not done by Toriyama.

25
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:55,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

26
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:58,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And I brought back a bunch of comics.

27
00:01:59,482 --> 00:02:00,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, cool.

28
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:03,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I know she's getting a lot of belated happy birthdays in our chat room.

29
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody else in the chat room.

30
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:08,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to join us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.

31
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:13,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we do tape live on all games radio, we do use a separate chat room still, our old chat room.

32
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com, or if you're already on the Game Search Network, it's channel Orange Lounge.

33
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got pie today, but I haven't eaten any of it.

34
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Birthday pie instead of birthday cake?

35
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:25,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my boss baked me a cake on Friday.

36
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:28,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not on Friday, but she brought me carrot cake, homemade carrot cake.

37
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:30,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Because carrot cake is my favorite cake.

38
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:30,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

39
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,561
[SPEAKER_05]: She baked me a cake.

40
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:34,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy.

41
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:36,785
[SPEAKER_02]: That's even better than giving you a cookie is baking you a cake.

42
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:38,226
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got pie today.

43
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:38,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

44
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:39,567
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of pie?

45
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:40,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I did eat a lot of cookies, though.

46
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:42,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I had samosas.

47
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I love samosas.

48
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:49,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I ate them, they were cold too, and had Mars Bars eggs, and Nestle Black Magic eggs.

49
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you gotta stop talking, I miss all these foods ever since I had to go on the low-fat diet thanks to the pancreas.

50
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:54,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Pie is good for you.

51
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on.

52
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It's full of vitamin banana.

53
00:02:57,382 --> 00:03:00,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move over and say hello to Techmaster Loki, who also joins us every week.

54
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:01,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

55
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:02,223
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

56
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.

57
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Any cookies or pie in your day?

58
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:05,724
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

59
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:06,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have an exciting weekend?

60
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:07,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything fun?

61
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:14,025
[SPEAKER_00]: I waited two hours to eat at Joe's Crab Shack yesterday, I guess.

62
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:15,226
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not fun.

63
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:15,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours?

64
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:16,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours.

65
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,567
[SPEAKER_00]: That must have been some damn good seafood.

66
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:21,388
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just we were damn patient.

67
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:25,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really popular here, though, in Sacramento, though, because it's on the river.

68
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,170
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Saturday night.

69
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:29,672
[SPEAKER_00]: It was during Dinner Rush, and they had prom people there.

70
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:30,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

71
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:33,133
[SPEAKER_00]: People are dumb.

72
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:35,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I was out of town for four days.

73
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:36,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed Jamie's birthday, sadly.

74
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:39,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I was completely out of town since Thursday.

75
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:45,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I did my yearly pilgrimage out to the middle of nowhere, also known as Mendocino, which is up on the north coast of California.

76
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:54,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it's a vacation from life, but it's also a vacation from the internets and everything because there's no phone connection out there.

77
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:55,577
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no internet.

78
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:56,198
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no nothing.

79
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:57,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the beach, hot tub.

80
00:03:58,179 --> 00:04:02,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times, except for the food poisoning I got that kept me in bed all day Saturday.

81
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:02,943
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of sucked.

82
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:09,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, I did end up playing some video games, so I'll talk about that in a minute, right after we get to DarkSakura's Gaming Week.

83
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:10,219
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your Gaming Week?

84
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:23,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it wasn't, well, other than Ragnarok, but I bought Famitsu and Blue Dragon Manga, and we were supposed to hook up the Dreamcast.

85
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:30,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We had talked about hooking up the Dreamcast so that I could play a couple of things that I've been sort of having an itch to, but instead I downloaded ZSNES today.

86
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:35,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Ssj100Matt says, you ate at the Crab Shack on Passover?

87
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:35,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Fired.

88
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:08,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody who didn't change their name, OilArmyRecruit2559 says, Always with the Ragnacrack.

89
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and your point is?

90
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever sign up for the number two?

91
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:13,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Solid Goomba, by the way.

92
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:14,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

93
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:15,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever sign up for the number two?

94
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:20,971
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm going to wait until they have more than just menus translated.

95
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:24,493
[SPEAKER_02]: To get some of the bugs worked out from the early releases?

96
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:28,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I'd actually like to be able to do the quests, and I don't read Korean.

97
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:41,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I, amazingly enough, know how Korean is read, you know, how the characters are arranged, but I do not actually read any Korean.

98
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:42,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

99
00:05:43,246 --> 00:05:43,646
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright.

100
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:44,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's perfect.

101
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:46,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on over to Loki.

102
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:48,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there any Korean in your gaming week?

103
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,070
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

104
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:49,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, then what was there?

105
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think.

106
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:51,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

107
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:55,244
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Omega 5, actually.

108
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:58,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I was downloading some Xbox Live Arcade games.

109
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I downloaded Ikaruga, but I never got the chance to play it.

110
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:06,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I did play... Actually, I played the demo of... What was it?

111
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:10,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.

112
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,860
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the new release this week?

113
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was out.

114
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:18,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky and Bullwinkle and... Oh, that's right, the minigame thing.

115
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:20,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to check that out.

116
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta catch up.

117
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:23,411
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that sucked, but whatever.

118
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:28,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually kind of excited there's another game out there that uses the webcam, other than Totem Ball.

119
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Totem Ball and what, Uno?

120
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, we shouldn't be encouraging them.

121
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:34,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fine, whatever.

122
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:37,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, yeah, I played Omega 5.

123
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:38,525
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool.

124
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,187
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really hard, but that's kind of shooters for you, I guess.

125
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:48,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I played lots of Mario Kart, and it's kind of, I don't know.

126
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:51,093
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's just like the other Mario Karts.

127
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:53,434
[SPEAKER_00]: I still really hate the fact that you can't do...

128
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:55,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

129
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:13,056
[SPEAKER_00]: More Saints Row, yes.

130
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I played multiplayer, but then I realized something.

131
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:27,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I haven't realized it before, but I just found a code in the game that actually makes this game totally different and a lot fun in just the weirdest way.

132
00:07:27,432 --> 00:07:29,934
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't stop giggling the entire time I was playing this.

133
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:36,669
[SPEAKER_00]: The code is the evil cars code, and it makes all the cars in the game try to hunt you down and kill you.

134
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:38,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

135
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll be running around or something.

136
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:48,399
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, this car comes from nowhere, just flying through the air just at your head, where they'll be backing up towards you.

137
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:53,043
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I made it kind of a goal to run from one end of the map to the next.

138
00:07:53,403 --> 00:08:06,652
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's fun and in fact I think I might actually do a little video for YouTube or something like that just something funny with you know that whole thing in there because it's hilarious because you'll be hiding in like a little ditch or something all of a sudden all these cars fly over your head and stuff trying to kill you

139
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:08,863
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

140
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:32,202
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was going to say, it would be fun.

141
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:33,963
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be a fun multiplayer game.

142
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Who can live longer being chased stocked by the cars?

143
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:44,270
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've been doing, like I said, I put in the infinite ammo code, the infinite sprint, and just go crazy.

144
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Just run.

145
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:47,372
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty hard.

146
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:55,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you get onto the freeway and stuff and there's trucks coming after you and cars are exploding because they keep running into each other.

147
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:57,129
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

148
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:58,070
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.

149
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,691
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt and Chad is chiming in with Death Race 3000, which he wants to point out is being remade.

150
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one where you get stalked by cars?

151
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:05,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Race?

152
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,993
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's the one that's just like Carmageddon.

153
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:10,334
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know the one you're thinking about.

154
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:11,875
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Stephen King movie.

155
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:12,555
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Carrie!

156
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:14,736
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Carrie was the... Christine!

157
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrie was the prom queen.

158
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:20,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Christine was the one about the Plymouth Fury.

159
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:20,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

160
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:24,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's another one I was thinking of where the cars were alive.

161
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:27,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember they had that big rig with the clown face on the front?

162
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:28,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It?

163
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:29,645
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that wasn't it.

164
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:30,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

165
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:31,546
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what it's called.

166
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:32,227
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that important.

167
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:34,268
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure someone in chat will know, though.

168
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:35,849
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, it's cool, though.

169
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,093
[SPEAKER_00]: The code just, you know, I guess a little bit more life for this next few weeks until Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out.

170
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:43,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've been extending the life of Saints Row for quite some time.

171
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:45,417
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the only people I know that still just...

172
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,561
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't shut up about this game, ever.

173
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:48,161
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great game.

174
00:09:48,702 --> 00:09:53,443
[SPEAKER_00]: I already have my Saints Row 2 pre-ordered, so I can't wait to play that too.

175
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:59,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's always pro-Saints Row or pro-Grand Theft Auto and hating on the other ones.

176
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:00,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand why you can't like both.

177
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:02,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I love both games just equally.

178
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:04,085
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good in different ways.

179
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:14,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Grand Theft Auto tends to be more realistic, where Saints Row is just absolutely batshit crazy with all sorts of stuff that you wouldn't be able to do in real life.

180
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:15,287
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just great.

181
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:19,009
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, chat.orangealtrader.com, some comments.

182
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:25,272
[SPEAKER_02]: In response to the Vision Cam, VXJSNXV says, Rayman's Raving Rabbids on the 360 use the Vision Cam.

183
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:26,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless, of course, you're talking about Arcade Consoling.

184
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:32,056
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brad from PodCulture, Maximum Overdrive was the name of the movie with the cars there.

185
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice work.

186
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:34,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice work.

187
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:37,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say about Rayman's Raving Rabbids.

188
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I was already worn out from the Wii version.

189
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:45,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I never even bothered with the 360 version because I was already kind of... It's dirt cheap now because that game didn't sell for crap.

190
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:47,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, aren't they making a sequel though?

191
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:49,802
[SPEAKER_00]: They already made a sequel, Rayman's Raving Rabbids 2.

192
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:52,643
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out on the Wii last year around the holiday.

193
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:53,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently I slept through it.

194
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:54,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you didn't miss much.

195
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:55,624
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I hear.

196
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:59,955
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't do one for the 360 because the 360 one didn't sell at all.

197
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:02,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee wants to know, can you use a vision cam on the computer?

198
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:03,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can, actually.

199
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:09,302
[SPEAKER_02]: There's software available on Microsoft's website, but there's no audio with it, and the quality's not great.

200
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:18,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually considered using it for our Justin TV feed, which is taping our show over at justintv.com, but the quality's not that great.

201
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's why we don't use it.

202
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,511
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does work.

203
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:23,671
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a USB camera.

204
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:36,334
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week, believe it or not, even though I was out of town for four days, I did get the opportunity to play something new because what is going into the wilderness with ten of your friends staying in a cabin and not bringing along some party video game?

205
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:39,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to check out for the first time SingStar on the PlayStation 2.

206
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:44,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've talked about this game an awful lot on the show, but I've always been more of a karaoke revolution player.

207
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:45,436
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the games I've had.

208
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:47,797
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did get to check out SingStar and

209
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,078
[SPEAKER_02]: The friend of ours had a variety.

210
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:53,539
[SPEAKER_02]: He had SingStar 80s, SingStar Pop, and SingStar Amped.

211
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:59,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess one kind of cool thing is that you could switch back and forth between the games without having to turn the whole dang thing off and on.

212
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:02,824
[SPEAKER_02]: You just pop in another disc and it loads the 30 songs from that disc.

213
00:12:03,544 --> 00:12:04,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Each game has about 30 songs.

214
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:06,385
[SPEAKER_02]: SingStar was kind of fun.

215
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:08,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I was more impressed with it than I thought I would be.

216
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:13,769
[SPEAKER_02]: The only kind of bitches I have is that I didn't like the pitch gauging quite as much as I do in Karaoke Revolution.

217
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:16,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you can only see your pitch as you sing.

218
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,531
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see it...

219
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:23,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Any time you're saying something into the mic, like you do in Karaoke Revolution, you really kind of have to play both games to know what I'm talking about.

220
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:28,493
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you play Karaoke Revolution, any time you make a sound, that arrow shows up on the line to show you where you're at.

221
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:32,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas in SingStar, you don't see it until you're already singing.

222
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:39,295
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing I did like about SingStar is that it had pretty much all the real music videos in the background as you're playing, which is kind of cool.

223
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:45,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Like SingStar Pop has Aha Take On Me, so you know we had to play that just to see the video, because, I mean...

224
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,779
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the last time you saw Aha take on me, the video?

225
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's got to be years and years ago.

226
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our listeners are probably too young to even remember this video.

227
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:54,241
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

228
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:55,701
[SPEAKER_05]: About four days ago.

229
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:57,582
[SPEAKER_02]: On YouTube or something?

230
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't seen it in years.

231
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:02,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one hit lender song.

232
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:03,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but still.

233
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,946
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt says Rob in a cabin in the woods with SingStar horror movie plotline anyone?

234
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:30,983
[SPEAKER_02]: kinda it could have been but I there was a lot of songs I sang and had a pretty recognizable song list I actually think I might want to pick this game up on Playstation 3 although only as a party game I mean you know how there's those video games that really only work when you have friends over SingStar is definitely one of those games maybe maybe

235
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:34,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Because why get a PlayStation 3 for this crappy game?

236
00:13:34,073 --> 00:13:40,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not going to get it just for that, but I like the fact that there's the music videos, the actual music videos in the background, and the way it's put together is nice.

237
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:43,879
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you just want it so you can film yourself and put yourself on that fake YouTube thing.

238
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:46,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no, hell no, because our listeners will find a way to exploit it.

239
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to subject myself to that.

240
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:52,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine me getting on there singing Like a Prayer?

241
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:55,067
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what happened last time I sang Like a Prayer karaoke?

242
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:59,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been like 10 years and I haven't lived it down, so not gonna happen, sorry.

243
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:01,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if it is, it's set to private or something.

244
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:02,350
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

245
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So, alright.

246
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:08,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, and I played on the PSP, because William brought his PSP.

247
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,113
[SPEAKER_02]: He was playing the shit out of Puzzle Quest most of the time.

248
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:13,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I played more Final Fantasy while I was sick yesterday, because I got food poisoning or something.

249
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:15,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sick all day yesterday.

250
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:15,656
[SPEAKER_02]: One or two?

251
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:15,836
[SPEAKER_02]: One.

252
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:19,056
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the old school upgraded one on PSP.

253
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:23,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've talked about it on the show before a while back, but man, the graphics are just beautiful on the PSP.

254
00:14:24,257 --> 00:14:26,218
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing the PSP does have going for it.

255
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:30,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it has that little screen and everything, the graphics are high def and gorgeous.

256
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,879
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing I really like about the PSP.

257
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:38,100
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of want to go and get Final Fantasy 2 so I can play that on my PSP.

258
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if I want to borrow Final Fantasy 1, I will.

259
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:41,621
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get into the 2.

260
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:42,141
[SPEAKER_00]: It was...

261
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:43,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

262
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:44,990
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just different.

263
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:45,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

264
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:46,652
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just different.

265
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:48,234
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

266
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:49,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's going to do it for our gaming week.

267
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:58,345
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to join in and chime in on our gaming weeks or the news for tonight, you can join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

268
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:01,888
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, we do have some housekeeping for you guys.

269
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:16,449
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that kind of made me sad, you know we have the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki at orangeloungeradio.wikia.com and that is growing and growing and the people, the listeners that have been contributing to that are doing an awesome job.

270
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:17,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

271
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,849
[SPEAKER_02]: The bad news isn't about that.

272
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:24,490
[SPEAKER_02]: The bad news is about Wikipedia, the main site, you know, wikipedia.org.

273
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,611
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how Orange Lounge Radio had an article on there?

274
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,611
[SPEAKER_02]: It got zapped.

275
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:29,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody deleted it.

276
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:30,895
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ridiculous.

277
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:31,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

278
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:32,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing I don't get.

279
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:41,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought that articles, when they got deleted from Wikipedia, had to go through a review phase for articles pended for deletion or whatever, and people are supposed to review it.

280
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:41,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Nuh-uh.

281
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:46,086
[SPEAKER_02]: When I looked in the deletion log, this guy named ClockworkSoul just nuked it.

282
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,267
[SPEAKER_02]: He must be some admin on there.

283
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:52,751
[SPEAKER_02]: He just nuked it, and it said, Web content does not indicate important significance.

284
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:53,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

285
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:57,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Without any debate or argument, this guy just kind of did it.

286
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you know who to go after.

287
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:28,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the first show to use Skype.

288
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:32,218
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a part of me that thinks we were the first online show to use Skype, and I think I have the post to back that up.

289
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:38,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to toot our horn too much, but I think there are things we have accomplished that make it somewhat notable.

290
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:44,685
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the other websites referred to on there that are still there?

291
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:48,947
[SPEAKER_02]: First site to use a PSP-based website?

292
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,428
[SPEAKER_02]: First gaming thing to have a PSP spinoff site?

293
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:52,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

294
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:54,738
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's just put it back up.

295
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:56,719
[SPEAKER_00]: First and least updated.

296
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:03,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I would just say if you guys are going to go back and recreate it, you just might want to source some things.

297
00:17:03,764 --> 00:17:06,206
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know some of our news stories are on YouTube, whatever.

298
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:07,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, we'll see what happens.

299
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:11,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless, we do have the Orange Laundry Wiki, which is like ten times better anyway.

300
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody can delete that.

301
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:14,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

302
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:15,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

303
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:15,712
[SPEAKER_02]: See if we care.

304
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:16,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

305
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:21,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Our communities, we have MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

306
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:24,990
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our Facebook community, the Oil Army, our Live Journal community at Orange Lounge.

307
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us if you are on any of those communities.

308
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:32,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of community, the All Games community has banded together for this.

309
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:33,520
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.

310
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:40,541
[SPEAKER_02]: A limited edition Xbox 360 Elite based on Grand Theft Auto 4 is being given away.

311
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have to correct something that was said last week's show.

312
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,424
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not one of the 500.

313
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:45,685
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bad news.

314
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:51,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not one of the 500 like uber limited edition things that Mark Echo got one of and we were making fun of him.

315
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the other 499 went, we have no idea.

316
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,654
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good news is it's one of eight.

317
00:17:57,608 --> 00:18:06,411
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of eight Xboxes being prepared with the whole customization specifically for community websites as a Grand Theft Auto promotion.

318
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:25,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Allgames.com has one and Orange Launch Radio is coming together with a bunch of all game shows including All Games Interactive, Dead Pixel Live, Bobby Blackwolf Show, Super Happy Funtime Show, Electric Sisterhood, Mediaspective, Chatterbox Video Game Radio, Video Game Outsiders, Ultimate Quest, Video Game Show and Platformation all coming together to give away this Xbox 360 Elite.

319
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:29,358
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you want to win this, you can.

320
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:30,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Because here's how it's going to work.

321
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:36,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one of those affiliates I just named is going to send one finalist to the final round.

322
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:37,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's how it works.

323
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:39,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Every show is doing the same giveaway.

324
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:45,647
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen is that... Okay, you know how like Grand Theft Auto, one of the big things in it is the radio stations that play?

325
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, Grand Theft Auto, huge on the soundtracks, right?

326
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,250
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the last one had what, like a four-disc soundtrack?

327
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And they play all these songs.

328
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:52,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

329
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Amidst the songs are fake DJs.

330
00:18:56,881 --> 00:19:00,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And people tell me all the time I sound like that one DJ in Grand Theft Auto.

331
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:01,545
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is his name?

332
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Laszlo.

333
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently I sound like him.

334
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:05,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's true or not.

335
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:07,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hear it, but I guess other people do.

336
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,391
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know how Grand Theft Auto has those DJs and stuff?

337
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,773
[SPEAKER_02]: They have little commercials and fake DJ things.

338
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:14,935
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to be that.

339
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:16,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how it works.

340
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You are going to submit a sound clip.

341
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:25,242
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't be any longer than two minutes and it has to be in the style of a Grand Theft Auto 4 radio station commercial.

342
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:30,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be a spoof ad, a segment, it can be a little song and dance, whatever.

343
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:33,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to somehow relate to Orange Lounge Radio.

344
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:35,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's the only thing.

345
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,192
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be one of our in-jokes, and if you don't know any in-jokes, go check the wiki.

346
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:42,715
[SPEAKER_02]: It can just say our name in it somewhere, whatever.

347
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:46,438
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has to somehow relate to Orange Lounge Radio.

348
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:50,220
[SPEAKER_02]: We will pick our favorites, like maybe our top five favorites.

349
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:58,166
[SPEAKER_02]: The community will vote on the winner, which will then go on to the final round at allgames.com to win one of these eight rare 360s.

350
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:01,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like, what, two minutes worth of voiceover?

351
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:01,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

352
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:06,192
[SPEAKER_02]: for possibly an Xbox 360 Elite, one of eight being made in the world.

353
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:08,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

354
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:15,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So the contest starts tonight, and if you have an MP3 you would like to submit to us, you can send that on in.

355
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,985
[SPEAKER_02]: You can either send it to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, or we will set up a special page on our forums where you can send those in.

356
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:21,806
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll pick our favorites.

357
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:27,811
[SPEAKER_02]: The community will then vote on the winner, and then what happens is that the winning bumper goes to All Games Radio

358
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:31,432
[SPEAKER_02]: and All Games Radio will choose the ultimate winner out of those.

359
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:39,173
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, the good news is just for winning from us, you get an All Games t-shirt and a $25 gift certificate to shop.allgames.com.

360
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:42,114
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell video games, so that's like half off a video game right there.

361
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:43,074
[SPEAKER_02]: So go for it.

362
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:44,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Submission starts tonight.

363
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:49,115
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have these in by May 4th at midnight Pacific time.

364
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,195
[SPEAKER_02]: No late entries accepted.

365
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I know many of you listen to several shows on allgames.com.

366
00:20:55,356 --> 00:21:10,019
[SPEAKER_02]: you can submit multiple entries per multiple shows but keep in mind you'll probably have to do different bumpers because you know since we're making you have something related to Orange Lounge Radio for example Electric Sista Hood would probably want something relating to their show and so on and so on

367
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:28,100
[SPEAKER_02]: we have the right to play your submission on our show blah blah blah if one person should win multiple contests a coin flip determines the winner open to North American residents only I'm sorry US and Canada only it's an NTSC console so we can't give it to Europe those are the rules sorry Europe

368
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can't really give it to anybody else because it's going to me.

369
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:35,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, cast and crew of the participating affiliate shows are not eligible.

370
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:35,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Loki.

371
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:41,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And last but not least, no copywritten materials permitted in the entry.

372
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:42,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Parody is fine.

373
00:21:42,986 --> 00:21:49,492
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't use, like, if you want to play Welcome to the Jungle, you have to, like, sing it yourself or something or, you know, Welcome to the Radio or something.

374
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:49,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

375
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:51,474
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to sing a makeup thing.

376
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:52,675
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

377
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:55,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft is asking, what about Mexico?

378
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I will have to ask the official judges about that.

379
00:21:58,425 --> 00:22:00,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that counts as North America.

380
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:03,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's okay, but I will get the final ruling on that shortly.

381
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Decisions of the judges are final.

382
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:06,279
[SPEAKER_02]: No bitching.

383
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:13,307
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like the full list of rules, they are available on forums.allgames.com and we'll be posting them on our site soon.

384
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:16,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like, what, like $500 prize right there?

385
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:17,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice stuff.

386
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:23,790
[SPEAKER_02]: There's prizes for second and third place too, but if I told you that tonight, I'd have nothing to tell you about next week when we plug the contest again.

387
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So get working on it.

388
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,351
[SPEAKER_02]: A two-minute commercial parody.

389
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:32,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio, anything that would happen in one of those little radio bits in the Grand Theft Auto game.

390
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:33,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Be creative.

391
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:41,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if you want, if you don't have a fancy recording studio set up in your place, you can also leave it on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

392
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:44,395
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're not live, you can call in and leave a bumper there.

393
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:46,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't say you don't have many different ways to send this in.

394
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:51,837
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all futile anyways because, like I said and stated again, the console's going to me.

395
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:53,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though you're ineligible.

396
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:54,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I'm ineligible.

397
00:22:54,837 --> 00:22:56,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, I'm not even entering and it's going to me.

398
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:56,978
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

399
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:58,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvel vs. Capcom

400
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:17,917
[SPEAKER_00]: SubZero Staring Down Batman Midways Gamer Day

401
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:38,323
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were showing off a trailer featuring Sub-Zero fighting Batman.

402
00:23:38,923 --> 00:23:52,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And the game itself, I don't know, I'm not a huge Mortal Kombat fan, but flying through the air while punching each other or falling, it's kind of hokey, but that's just my opinion, you know, whatever.

403
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:55,650
[SPEAKER_05]: It made me think of the more recent Dead or Alive games.

404
00:23:56,129 --> 00:24:04,575
[SPEAKER_00]: All I gotta say is, I hope they have villains in there as well, other than just... Because I think it would be pretty badass if they had a cool version of Joker in there.

405
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that might be pretty cool.

406
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:09,358
[SPEAKER_02]: It might also be in horrible taste, though, to play a fatality on the Joker.

407
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:10,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, shut up.

408
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:13,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, fucking Jack Nicklaus is still alive.

409
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares if, you know... Jack Nicklaus was a golf player.

410
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:17,388
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean Jack Nicholson?

411
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicholson, whatever.

412
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:22,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, little did you know, Jack Nicklaus was actually Joker at one time.

413
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:28,775
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jack Nicholson... It's just... All these things you don't know about movies, Rob.

414
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:33,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I said this on Bobby's show when we were doing our little tease before we went live tonight.

415
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:38,562
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is that obviously this game is not going to have fatalities because it's going for a teen rating or whatever, right?

416
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:38,742
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

417
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:41,683
[SPEAKER_02]: and people are like, oh my god, I can't believe it.

418
00:24:41,723 --> 00:24:43,965
[SPEAKER_02]: What's a Mortal Kombat game without fatalities?

419
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:47,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sacrilegious to be able to perform a fatality on Wonder Woman.

420
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:48,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

421
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:49,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Or on Batman.

422
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't decapitate Batman.

423
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:51,629
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't.

424
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:53,310
[SPEAKER_05]: You can break Batman's back.

425
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,951
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do a friendship on Batman all you want.

426
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:56,931
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, that might be kind of funny.

427
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:58,092
[SPEAKER_05]: You can break his back.

428
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,793
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be hilarious because that's what happened to him.

429
00:24:59,813 --> 00:25:00,413
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they should be mature.

430
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:01,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.

431
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop pussying out, DC.

432
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:03,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.

433
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:06,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody said in chat earlier you could kill Superman but he'd just come back.

434
00:25:07,077 --> 00:25:07,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

435
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:10,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

436
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:12,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just sacrilegious.

437
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:14,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ask me why.

438
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:17,759
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something about seeing your childhood hero get decapitated as all kinds of wrong.

439
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's a question for you.

440
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:24,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you think of any game whatsoever that's had Superman in it that's been any good?

441
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:30,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Superman on the Atari 2600 when I was five years old was the shit.

442
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:31,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well that doesn't count.

443
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:32,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

444
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:35,057
[SPEAKER_02]: You said name a Superman video game that was good.

445
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:38,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I was thinking, I don't know, within this decade.

446
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,581
[SPEAKER_04]: There was that Justice League game.

447
00:25:39,642 --> 00:25:40,983
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't very good.

448
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:44,046
[SPEAKER_04]: It was better than the straight Superman games.

449
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:47,568
[SPEAKER_00]: All the games that Superman has ever touched, crap.

450
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:49,248
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm sorry.

451
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,709
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't going to be very good.

452
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:51,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's Superman's fault.

453
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,331
[SPEAKER_00]: He should have stayed dead like a good superhero.

454
00:25:54,591 --> 00:26:02,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of a fatality, I'm thinking the game will have nudalities where the characters are forced to don their own underoos.

455
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:04,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

456
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:07,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that wouldn't get a teen rating, though.

457
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:08,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope the Wonder Twins are in it.

458
00:26:09,997 --> 00:26:16,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all I can say is this is going to come out and be yet another mediocre Mortal Kombat game.

459
00:26:17,803 --> 00:26:21,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I the only one that actually enjoys Mortal Kombat's combat system?

460
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:25,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of liked how you could switch between the fighting styles and the weapons.

461
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually kind of enjoy the Mortal Kombat games, not just for the fatalities.

462
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:33,276
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm to be fair, though, I don't like Street Fighter either, so, you know.

463
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:42,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the fact that everything was hand-drawn stuff in Marvel vs. Capcom.

464
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:50,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, if they wanted to do a 2D fighter with the Mortal Kombat characters all hand-drawn, and not really Mortal Kombat style, but kind of ripping off SNK or Capcom,

465
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,268
[SPEAKER_00]: DC Comics Marvel vs. DC Fighter Marvel vs. DC Fighter

466
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,741
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's read comments from chat room.

467
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:21,703
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100, Matt wants to point out, there was a good Superman arcade game.

468
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:30,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma says, mind you, Mortal Kombat vs. DC idea has been around since Marvel vs. Capcom, which is funny because I know it's been brought up on this show before.

469
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:35,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say this whole thing was in rumor state a couple months ago, and we joked about it then.

470
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:41,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma continues, and as much as I'm not too thrilled about not having fatalities, Mortal Kombat vs. DC does not need it.

471
00:27:41,857 --> 00:27:45,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the fandom will be pissed off, but the DC fandom is bigger than the Mortal Kombat fandom,

472
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what's going to happen.

473
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:51,622
[SPEAKER_00]: This game is going to be in development right now.

474
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:53,003
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scheduled out for the fall.

475
00:27:53,243 --> 00:27:54,424
[SPEAKER_00]: What movie is coming out this summer?

476
00:27:55,504 --> 00:27:56,125
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dark Knight.

477
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:58,826
[SPEAKER_00]: What movie is going to probably be out on DVD in the fall?

478
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:00,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where the whoring begins.

479
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:07,170
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to put this out at the same time as the fucking Dark Knight movie, and they're just going to try to sell some more copies on a mediocre game.

480
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon my ignorance, I don't follow comic books, but is Iron Man DC or Marvel?

481
00:28:10,952 --> 00:28:11,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvel.

482
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:11,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, never mind.

483
00:28:12,012 --> 00:28:12,713
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not related.

484
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:16,276
[SPEAKER_02]: because I was going to say there's the Iron Man movie coming out too, but I guess that's old.

485
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:17,117
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Marvel.

486
00:28:17,157 --> 00:28:18,297
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Marvel whoring.

487
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:19,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that's why I asked.

488
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:20,577
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm getting the Iron Man game too.

489
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:26,658
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Sega whoring Marvel characters like that and the Incredible Hulk.

490
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:31,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Both games which look good, but I think are going to be mediocre.

491
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:38,181
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think the last comic book I bought when I was maybe seven years old was Uncle Scrooge and Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

492
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:39,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I have comics right here.

493
00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:40,901
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

494
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:41,601
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

495
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:43,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Best comic book game ever.

496
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,483
[SPEAKER_05]: DuckTales was a pretty awesome comic book game.

497
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Comics.

498
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:48,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

499
00:28:48,404 --> 00:28:48,664
[SPEAKER_00]: X-Men.

500
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:49,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what a comic looks like?

501
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:50,865
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a graphic novel.

502
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:51,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

503
00:28:51,285 --> 00:28:52,606
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an older one, too.

504
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:55,627
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what adults have to read nowadays because you can't read comics.

505
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:56,948
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to read graphic novels.

506
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:58,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell no.

507
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I still buy comics.

508
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:01,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to ask this.

509
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Instapoll in chat.

510
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,132
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a greater comic book game than DuckTales.

511
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:06,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Y or N?

512
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:14,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, we'll see what the Instapoll results are in a minute.

513
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,220
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, Tigerclaw wants to add this.

514
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:29,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this is in our show role anywhere, but speaking of Mortal Kombat, I don't know if you heard this, the actor who was Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat movie, Robin Shu, he is going to be Jen in the new Street Fighter movie.

515
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:35,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that crossover there for Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter that one of the actors is going to be.

516
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:36,833
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very loose, Rob.

517
00:29:37,173 --> 00:29:38,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, a little bit.

518
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:44,141
[SPEAKER_00]: and little does he realize what kind of, you know, crap he is walking into.

519
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:49,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we not forget Raul Julia and what happened to him in the last Street Fighter movie?

520
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:52,669
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

521
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Soul keeps burning on July 29th.

522
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:17,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

523
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:18,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, not on that day.

524
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:19,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else will come out that day.

525
00:30:19,947 --> 00:30:25,089
[SPEAKER_02]: On Xbox Live Arcade, though, sometime this summer, Soul Calibur is going to be coming out.

526
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:34,493
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be old school because it's the Dreamcast version that's actually coming to Xbox Live Arcade, not the arcade version of Soul Calibur.

527
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:36,034
[SPEAKER_05]: It better have the Japanese voices in it.

528
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:37,713
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of cool.

529
00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:39,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my man was Maxi.

530
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:43,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It will have arcade training and survival modes in it.

531
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was revealed at Namco's Gamers Day.

532
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:48,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not the arcade version.

533
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:50,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the Dreamcast version.

534
00:30:51,547 --> 00:30:55,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the question is, will it have to squeeze into that 150 megabyte limit or not?

535
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:56,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

536
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:00,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be pretty rad.

537
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:03,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if they're up the graphics to HD and all that other good stuff they usually do.

538
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:04,600
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be pretty rad.

539
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think, Jamie?

540
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be fairly pretty.

541
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:11,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul Calibur is also, remember, the game that gave us Rod Calibur.

542
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we just, well, that's the next question.

543
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:18,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Will we be able to use other interesting control devices on the Xbox 360?

544
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:22,088
[SPEAKER_05]: See, there isn't a fishing rod controller for that.

545
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:23,409
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but there's the Scenic controller.

546
00:31:24,414 --> 00:31:25,495
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool.

547
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:29,738
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a contest.

548
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:32,520
[SPEAKER_00]: The rock band drums.

549
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Guitar caliber.

550
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:37,263
[SPEAKER_05]: We want guitar caliber.

551
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:40,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Soul Calibur with my DDR pads.

552
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:44,968
[SPEAKER_05]: My first DDR I owned was the Dreamcast DDR.

553
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:50,312
[SPEAKER_05]: The only analog button on there was the Konami logo to put it into SSR.

554
00:31:50,905 --> 00:31:54,629
[SPEAKER_02]: and the question being asked in our chat room by none other than Bobby Blackwolf.

555
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:56,331
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, will it blend?

556
00:31:57,913 --> 00:32:00,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very good question, will it blend?

557
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:04,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the results of our quick poll and then we'll get to more Soul Calibur news courtesy of Jamie.

558
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick poll was, is there a comic book game better than DuckTales?

559
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:09,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are the results.

560
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:17,312
[SPEAKER_02]: N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, Y, X-Men Mutant Apocalypse.

561
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:19,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about maximum carnage.

562
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:19,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed that one.

563
00:32:20,554 --> 00:32:21,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Y, Superman 64.

564
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:24,575
[SPEAKER_02]: X-Men Arcade is a close second.

565
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,957
[SPEAKER_02]: N, Y, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighters.

566
00:32:28,577 --> 00:32:31,038
[SPEAKER_02]: N, N, DuckTales freaking rocked.

567
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:32,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Y, X-Men Arcade.

568
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:35,900
[SPEAKER_05]: The X-Men arcade game was really, really good.

569
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:40,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like the majority do believe DuckTales is the greatest comic book game ever made, though.

570
00:32:40,284 --> 00:32:41,805
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of surprises me.

571
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:44,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't count DuckTales as a comic book game.

572
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:47,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I think of the show.

573
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:53,455
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't a DuckTales comic book until I think six months after the show had already been out for a while.

574
00:32:54,076 --> 00:32:58,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So technically it was based off of... That question is actually invalid.

575
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:00,121
[SPEAKER_02]: So our entire poll was a crock of shit.

576
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:02,942
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire poll wasn't just a crock of shit.

577
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:07,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a crock of compost.

578
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:09,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then why don't you take us back to reality, Miss Summers?

579
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:11,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but I prefer unreality.

580
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:12,968
[SPEAKER_05]: So how about more Soul Calibur news?

581
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:23,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul Calibur 4 is going to be out on July 29th and there will be a regular and a premium edition.

582
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:23,740
[SPEAKER_05]: What you talk about, Jamie?

583
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul Calibur 3 was awesome.

584
00:33:38,322 --> 00:33:44,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Drew, you could make, was it the Pope, or was it the Pope character they made, or was that in Moral Combat?

585
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:46,506
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pope was in Soul Calibur 3.

586
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,287
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tansel's Pope.

587
00:33:52,868 --> 00:33:55,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot of friends actually make custom characters for that.

588
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,291
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the only thing I wanted, and I don't know if this one's going to have any customized.

589
00:34:02,012 --> 00:34:06,014
[SPEAKER_00]: The Special Edition, I think, was going to have some sort of thing for that.

590
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:14,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, you're going to get your choices of different characters like Darth Vader and Yoda and a bunch of other people.

591
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:15,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And no spawn.

592
00:34:17,343 --> 00:34:18,144
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, though.

593
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:20,805
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

594
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:40,493
[SPEAKER_05]: is of course different versions are going to have different characters like the Playstation 3 one will have Darth Vader, Xbox 360 one will have Yoda but there are but like you were saying the premium edition is going to have the extra customization content and a tournament kit and that will retail for $79.99

595
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:43,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Quandary.

596
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:47,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting my stimulus check, like we all are, hopefully, pretty soon, right?

597
00:34:48,017 --> 00:34:49,979
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking, hmm, $600.

598
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:53,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect amount to finally take the splurge and buy my damn PlayStation 3, right?

599
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:57,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know there's going to be all this crap around Christmas time I'm going to want, including home, right?

600
00:34:58,324 --> 00:35:11,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the thing, is that... Here's where I'm stuck, is that I don't know whether to get Soul Calibur 3 for the PlayStation 3 or Xbox, because I do think Vader is cooler than Yoda, so I kind of want the PlayStation 3 version based on that alone, but...

601
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:16,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I know on Xbox Live, the online is going to have to be better on Xbox Live.

602
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:17,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

603
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:20,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be more people and there's achievements and so on.

604
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:21,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do I do?

605
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:25,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys are both buy in your console ownings.

606
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:26,137
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

607
00:35:27,018 --> 00:35:28,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3?

608
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:30,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put the same question in chat.

609
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,239
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another mini quick poll.

610
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:36,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Only for those of you guys that own both systems, which one are you getting Soul Calibur 3 on and why, if you're buying it?

611
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Soul Calibur 4, what the hell?

612
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur 4 and why?

613
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:46,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking that we'll probably go with the Xbox 360 edition just because Yoda is comical fighting.

614
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:52,409
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, it's like you said, there's going to be more content out.

615
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:57,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, I also think that the Xbox 360 controller is just a little more comfortable for a fighting game.

616
00:35:58,313 --> 00:35:58,854
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just me.

617
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:00,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki?

618
00:36:02,898 --> 00:36:05,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't buy a system for that game.

619
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to buy the system for the game.

620
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the system for other stuff, too.

621
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,921
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just saying, if I'm going to have the system anyway.

622
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:12,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't buy the system until Home comes out.

623
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:14,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.

624
00:36:14,662 --> 00:36:15,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Because who knows?

625
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:18,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, this summer, they may be trying to drive sales.

626
00:36:18,103 --> 00:36:19,464
[SPEAKER_00]: They may drop the price again.

627
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:21,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me confess.

628
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:25,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm eyeing the whole gray metal MGS4 bundle.

629
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, good luck finding that.

630
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:45,833
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, you know, I guess I could be sort of biased towards the 360, but only because you should really look at the game more than just one character, and I know that Darth Vader's cool and all, but if you want to play Darth Vader kicking ass, just buy Force Unleashed when that comes out.

631
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:46,833
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um...

632
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:48,523
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

633
00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:54,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, how much did you... Well, I guess, you know, Soul Calibur 2, I mean, Link was pretty popular and stuff like that.

634
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:55,228
[SPEAKER_02]: See, exactly.

635
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:57,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you had to have Soul Calibur 2 on the GameCube because of Link.

636
00:36:57,969 --> 00:36:58,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Hands down.

637
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Hands down.

638
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:01,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

639
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:03,213
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have all of those.

640
00:37:03,649 --> 00:37:06,310
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's look at the chat room, what they thought.

641
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,410
[SPEAKER_02]: J-Rod says, PlayStation 3 equals Vader.

642
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Vader greater than all.

643
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:11,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Wolf says, I'm getting the PlayStation 3.

644
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:13,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have both because of Vader.

645
00:37:13,992 --> 00:37:17,233
[SPEAKER_02]: J-Rod says, the only way to get more people on PlayStation Network is to buy the PlayStation 3.

646
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:21,034
[SPEAKER_02]: J-Rod says, Soul Calibur 4 is PlayStation 3 for me.

647
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:24,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

648
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:28,828
[SPEAKER_02]: HitStun says you have to have Yoda versus Vader.

649
00:37:29,308 --> 00:37:31,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Queltipo says 360, fuck Vader.

650
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:38,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Sephiroth1215 says the PlayStation 3 version is better for Vader and the control is much better for Soul Calibur.

651
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:42,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Jrod answered the question like five times.

652
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:43,372
[SPEAKER_02]: It's throwing me off.

653
00:37:43,692 --> 00:37:47,193
[SPEAKER_02]: FootyMonster said if I get it, I'm going to go 360 because that's what I own.

654
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, Yoda greater than Vader.

655
00:37:49,054 --> 00:37:50,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I said it, bitches.

656
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And RawSteelUT says stop hating the PlayStation 3, Loki.

657
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:59,795
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hate the PS3, it's just, once again, they've got the achievement system built in already.

658
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:02,857
[SPEAKER_00]: I have more friends that are on the 360.

659
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:12,845
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be getting exclusive games for the PS3 when those come out, just right now, if there's a game coming out on both platforms, I'm going to get it on the 360.

660
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's to say, like Bobby said before, who's to say that they could possibly, you know, add these as download content later on for the other systems?

661
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:19,945
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

662
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,086
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

663
00:38:21,106 --> 00:38:22,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that could be all for naught.

664
00:38:37,338 --> 00:38:45,763
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, why would they pass up the opportunity to whore out themselves a little bit and sell the characters for an extra five bucks on top of the game?

665
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:48,124
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could see them doing that.

666
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially now that we have download content available.

667
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:52,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Time will tell.

668
00:38:52,246 --> 00:39:02,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I would see them, not so much the Vader-Yoda thing, but maybe bringing back classic Soul Calibur characters who maybe don't make the cut for Soul Calibur 4 or always were intended to be downloadables or something.

669
00:39:02,812 --> 00:39:03,873
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be a special mode.

670
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:05,607
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

671
00:39:06,088 --> 00:39:07,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what do you want to bet?

672
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,957
[SPEAKER_02]: If this custom creator thing is in it, that's where your download content is going to be.

673
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Download new pants.

674
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But the special mode should be the Kill Voldo mode.

675
00:39:17,226 --> 00:39:18,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Again and again and again?

676
00:39:18,547 --> 00:39:18,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

677
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:19,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Again.

678
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:22,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Replace the punching bag mode with just Voldo.

679
00:39:22,671 --> 00:39:22,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

680
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:23,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we'll see.

681
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on.

682
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:25,533
[SPEAKER_02]: New game.

683
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:32,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing that you may be able to download content on for Soul Calibur 4 would be the brand new PlayStation Store.

684
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,160
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

685
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,102
[SPEAKER_00]: This week, after a brief

686
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:36,662
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit of downtime.

687
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:41,143
[SPEAKER_00]: They finally brought back the PlayStation Store with its new features and stuff.

688
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:42,423
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot easier to browse.

689
00:39:43,283 --> 00:39:52,465
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally kind of caught up on all the content that 360 owners have had for a while including still live for Rock Band and all that stuff.

690
00:39:53,085 --> 00:39:55,105
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely worth checking out.

691
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:59,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Also coming along with that is the brand new firmware 2.30 and that's live as well and

692
00:40:05,007 --> 00:40:05,327
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

693
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:13,230
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be enhancing DTS HD and Master High Resolution Audio.

694
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,671
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a lot better.

695
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:20,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really care for the old PlayStation Store too much.

696
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:32,056
[SPEAKER_00]: I still wish that those prepaid cards are out there because that would be pretty nice so I could buy some with store credit instead of having to pony up real money for PlayStation money.

697
00:40:35,137 --> 00:40:36,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have yet to buy anything from the new store?

698
00:40:37,722 --> 00:40:39,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, not yet from the new store.

699
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:42,331
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, I haven't plugged in my PlayStation 3 in quite a while.

700
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:42,992
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

701
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:44,615
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not helping to cure cancer even?

702
00:40:45,216 --> 00:40:45,357
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

703
00:40:45,497 --> 00:40:45,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck cancer.

704
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:53,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing that I'm kind of surprised you haven't jumped out and downloaded, although, then again, it is kind of expensive, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

705
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now on the PSN store.

706
00:40:56,692 --> 00:40:58,714
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 1.9 gigabytes to download it.

707
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:01,017
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 bucks if you want to download this.

708
00:41:01,177 --> 00:41:02,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy the full game.

709
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:03,459
[SPEAKER_00]: At least you get a case with it.

710
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:08,824
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you stop playing it later on, you can sell it for, you know, money.

711
00:41:09,765 --> 00:41:19,768
[SPEAKER_02]: The weird thing is that the intro video and the ending videos don't come with the game when you download it, but you can download them later to view, which is kind of strange.

712
00:41:19,808 --> 00:41:22,509
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only get the ending video, of course, after you've beaten Gran Turismo.

713
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:32,112
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole documentary as well, Beyond the Apex, which is apparently only on the Blu-ray version of the game, so I guess if you want a documentary, you have that as well.

714
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:35,214
[SPEAKER_00]: But seriously though, that's the only thing I could see.

715
00:41:35,854 --> 00:41:46,280
[SPEAKER_00]: I know why they offered these games available to download, but if they're offering a disc version of it, I don't understand why people don't buy the disc version of the game since that's the thing.

716
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:52,803
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get tired of playing this game later on, or say for example, you want to sell it off before Gran Turismo 5 comes out.

717
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:55,625
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that with the download version.

718
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:56,305
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to

719
00:41:56,525 --> 00:41:58,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I can think of maybe two reasons.

720
00:41:58,606 --> 00:42:02,669
[SPEAKER_02]: One, convenience, especially for those that may live in the middle of nowhere where it's harder to get to a store.

721
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:04,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Your only option is like Walmart, right?

722
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:08,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, no sales tax in some places.

723
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:13,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if, because I know on Nintendo, if you live in California, you don't get charged sales tax on Wii Points.

724
00:42:13,436 --> 00:42:14,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with Xbox.

725
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:18,260
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think on PlayStation, which uses real money, I don't think you get charged sales tax.

726
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

727
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:21,242
[SPEAKER_00]: So you save a few bucks there.

728
00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:22,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saying.

729
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:26,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying, though, wouldn't you rather have a case and all that stuff for it?

730
00:42:27,105 --> 00:42:28,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

731
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:33,888
[SPEAKER_00]: If a game came out on the Xbox Live Arcade and I had a choice of downloading it or buying it in a store, I'd buy it in a store.

732
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:36,429
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just me, I guess.

733
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:37,530
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the PopCap game?

734
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess those didn't come out until way later, too.

735
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they didn't come out until way later.

736
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.

737
00:42:43,314 --> 00:42:47,317
[SPEAKER_02]: RossDLUT is pointing out in chat, Rob, the middle of nowhere isn't going to have broadband.

738
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:48,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's kind of true.

739
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:49,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes and no.

740
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:57,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I think broadband's really spreading out more and more, especially as, isn't satellite in some form starting to support like a broadband-esque type of connection?

741
00:42:57,384 --> 00:43:01,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and really, really middle of nowhere, there's always going to be a Walmart around.

742
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:04,052
[SPEAKER_00]: They pop up like Starbucks.

743
00:43:04,192 --> 00:43:07,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, maybe a bad excuse, but I don't know, just trying to think.

744
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously somebody's buying it or they wouldn't be putting it out there.

745
00:43:10,294 --> 00:43:10,474
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

746
00:43:10,694 --> 00:43:13,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, see, I like what they did with Warhawk.

747
00:43:14,115 --> 00:43:20,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, originally they had it where you can buy the version in stores and it came with a Bluetooth headset.

748
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:26,839
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was how they kind of, you know, you can do this and get all this extra stuff or if you don't want to buy that, you can just download the version of the game.

749
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Then later on they came out with the version that's just the game only, but...

750
00:43:32,259 --> 00:43:37,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it's still... I would rather buy it on disc, I guess.

751
00:43:38,223 --> 00:43:38,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

752
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:42,405
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you mentioned you and the husband got this game this week, right?

753
00:43:43,826 --> 00:43:45,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep wanting to say Grand Theft Auto, Gran Turismo.

754
00:43:46,288 --> 00:43:50,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Dan was playing quite a bit of it, and he had his cousin over playing it.

755
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really watch it, because you know me, I don't really give a crap.

756
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:53,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it pretty?

757
00:43:55,293 --> 00:43:57,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I said I didn't watch any of it, because I didn't give a crap.

758
00:43:58,356 --> 00:44:00,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought maybe Elise glanced at it once or twice.

759
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked a little bit.

760
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty.

761
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, see, that's what I was looking for.

762
00:44:05,404 --> 00:44:08,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys actually go get the box version or did you download it?

763
00:44:09,428 --> 00:44:10,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that Dan bought it.

764
00:44:11,246 --> 00:44:11,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

765
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,987
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably gets a discount anyway because of the whole game store connection thing.

766
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:15,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

767
00:44:15,547 --> 00:44:15,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

768
00:44:16,347 --> 00:44:16,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

769
00:44:16,627 --> 00:44:17,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.

770
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,068
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was pretty happy about it.

771
00:44:19,128 --> 00:44:24,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he was like... I was like, so why do you... And I straight out asked him, I was like, why did you want to pay money for a glorified demo?

772
00:44:25,649 --> 00:44:31,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, well, honestly, I look at this as more of a part A, you know, sort of thing.

773
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,191
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the game comes out...

774
00:44:35,511 --> 00:44:35,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't.

775
00:44:35,651 --> 00:44:35,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't.

776
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,861
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP is still hot shit in Japan

777
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:26,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, but it is.

778
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:34,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, in order of systems sold, number 6 is the Xbox 360.

779
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:36,908
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 2 is after that.

780
00:45:36,948 --> 00:45:38,149
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3 is after that.

781
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:40,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii is after that by quite a bit.

782
00:45:41,693 --> 00:45:43,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me actually just go back and give the numbers.

783
00:45:43,715 --> 00:45:43,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

784
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:53,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox 360 is at $1,147 PlayStation 2 is $6,834 PlayStation 3 is $8,232 Wii is $46,296 The DS $47,158 and PSP at $85,721 if that's going to put it into perspective as far as what was sold in the past week.

785
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:53,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

786
00:46:15,347 --> 00:46:42,574
[SPEAKER_05]: so just PSPs really got it now and actually I was looking through a couple of back issues of Famitsu when I was at Kinokuniya and there were plenty of PSP ads just in terms of ads there were just more and you know there's actually a couple of full just PSP only magazines so I thought that was kind of interesting Loki any thoughts on why the PSP is really taking off in Japan all of a sudden?

787
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:44,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Monster Hunter hmm

788
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:45,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

789
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:46,802
[SPEAKER_00]: They like the Monster Hunter.

790
00:46:47,964 --> 00:46:49,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Monster Hunter on PS3.

791
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:50,367
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be pretty awesome.

792
00:46:51,068 --> 00:46:51,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be.

793
00:46:52,669 --> 00:46:55,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

794
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,961
[SPEAKER_02]: No fanboy, no siree.

795
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:24,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Not over there.

796
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:25,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.

797
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I just know a great game when I see it.

798
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:31,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Not by a saw.

799
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:32,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you excited that it's gone gold?

800
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:33,890
[SPEAKER_02]: This means like no more delays.

801
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:34,871
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really going to happen.

802
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:35,812
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.

803
00:47:36,012 --> 00:47:36,272
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

804
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:37,414
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only like a week away, right?

805
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:37,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

806
00:47:37,994 --> 00:47:38,474
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the date?

807
00:47:38,675 --> 00:47:39,495
[SPEAKER_02]: April 29th.

808
00:47:40,256 --> 00:47:43,079
[SPEAKER_00]: See, the thing is though is I'm... Are you going to make it to the show that week?

809
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:43,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

810
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:47,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, there's a few reasons.

811
00:47:47,162 --> 00:47:49,303
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to Vegas that week, actually.

812
00:47:49,363 --> 00:47:50,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.

813
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:59,687
[SPEAKER_00]: To go train a certain large shoe company on how to sell games.

814
00:48:01,092 --> 00:48:02,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, a large shoe company?

815
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:03,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

816
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,114
[SPEAKER_02]: On how to sell games?

817
00:48:04,594 --> 00:48:04,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

818
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:05,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

819
00:48:05,935 --> 00:48:06,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

820
00:48:06,455 --> 00:48:08,977
[SPEAKER_00]: A certain website begins with Z. Okay.

821
00:48:08,997 --> 00:48:09,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

822
00:48:09,077 --> 00:48:09,957
[SPEAKER_00]: And ends with Epos.

823
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:12,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hold back.

824
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:15,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I get to go to Vegas.

825
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:17,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually thinking about...

826
00:48:19,474 --> 00:48:24,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing my 360 with me to play, you know, during... Because I'm going for a day.

827
00:48:24,218 --> 00:48:28,781
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually training them on, like, different... Kind of giving them, like, the games 101 type shit.

828
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:31,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there... I'm sure we have... I know we have listeners in Vegas.

829
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's some out there who would be like, Loki, come over.

830
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:34,285
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll play.

831
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:36,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll buy pizza and beer.

832
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:37,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

833
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:37,828
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the thing.

834
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:40,150
[SPEAKER_00]: My boss reminded me.

835
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,711
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all, you know, there's going to be 360s there.

836
00:48:42,872 --> 00:48:45,373
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just bring Grand Theft Auto with you.

837
00:48:45,414 --> 00:48:47,195
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I know, but I want to bring it...

838
00:48:48,576 --> 00:48:50,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I should bring it on the plane

839
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:22,615
[SPEAKER_02]: This game rules.

840
00:49:23,596 --> 00:49:26,776
[SPEAKER_02]: This game sucks.

841
00:49:27,337 --> 00:49:28,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Your controller's kind of big.

842
00:49:30,738 --> 00:49:32,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we have anything in your size.

843
00:49:33,578 --> 00:49:34,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

844
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:34,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

845
00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:37,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Another series that people are pretty into.

846
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Who likes their survival horror?

847
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:40,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Me.

848
00:49:40,761 --> 00:49:42,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like the game Siren?

849
00:49:43,749 --> 00:49:45,970
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

850
00:50:12,522 --> 00:50:20,648
[SPEAKER_02]: July 24th is the day it's supposed to come out, but a demo is supposed to be out very, very soon in Japan, so if you were a fan of Siren.

851
00:50:21,569 --> 00:50:24,711
[SPEAKER_02]: To which Jrod in chat says, Siren is absolutely terrible.

852
00:50:25,171 --> 00:50:26,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Avoid it at all costs.

853
00:50:26,352 --> 00:50:32,457
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have a big, like, Siren in the game that sounds just like the one from Silent Hill as well.

854
00:50:34,138 --> 00:50:37,681
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say rip-off because the game, I think, was out before Silent Hill, so...

855
00:50:38,257 --> 00:50:39,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Queltipo says, hooray for Siren.

856
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,860
[SPEAKER_02]: When nothing you do makes much sense, you just have to do it anyway.

857
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what if they go back and fix all the problems and make the graphics even prettier?

858
00:50:45,762 --> 00:50:47,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that make this game worth owning?

859
00:50:47,264 --> 00:50:47,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

860
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:52,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know, nothing's going to hurt having another survivor horror game out there.

861
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:54,088
[SPEAKER_00]: There really isn't that many.

862
00:50:54,128 --> 00:50:57,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but then you just have to keep reminding yourself, Silent Hill 5 this year.

863
00:50:57,651 --> 00:50:58,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill 5 this year.

864
00:50:58,992 --> 00:51:00,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you hope it's this year.

865
00:51:00,753 --> 00:51:00,993
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope.

866
00:51:01,033 --> 00:51:01,614
[SPEAKER_02]: It better be.

867
00:51:02,895 --> 00:51:05,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially after seeing the little preview clips for it.

868
00:51:05,156 --> 00:51:07,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so freaking excited.

869
00:51:08,171 --> 00:51:09,192
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bonerific.

870
00:51:10,293 --> 00:51:11,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'd go that far.

871
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:14,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't find the article.

872
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:15,698
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

873
00:51:16,478 --> 00:51:17,739
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some different gaming news then?

874
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,061
[SPEAKER_05]: How about some Rock Band?

875
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:20,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, I'll take it.

876
00:51:20,482 --> 00:51:29,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Harmonix is going to have up a downloadable album for Rock Band that's going to be available next week.

877
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,753
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Screaming for Vengeance by Judas Priest.

878
00:51:34,734 --> 00:51:37,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It has 10 tracks that will cost $15.

879
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:41,076
[SPEAKER_05]: It's both for PS3 and Xbox 360.

880
00:51:41,816 --> 00:51:45,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Each of the songs will be $2 a piece.

881
00:51:48,278 --> 00:51:53,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Later on, coming in May, there will be an album by The Cars and then Doolittle by The Pixies.

882
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,780
[SPEAKER_05]: The Pixies are cool.

883
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:58,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like they're just still working on trying to get those out.

884
00:51:58,686 --> 00:51:59,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's kind of a neat idea.

885
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:08,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, though, that they were supposed to have The Who have a first downloadable album, but they said that that's going to be later on.

886
00:52:11,368 --> 00:52:22,131
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting that they're going this download album route, especially in a day and age where, you know, I don't know, this is probably a bit of a controversial statement, but where music seems to be getting away from the albums.

887
00:52:22,332 --> 00:52:23,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sad but true.

888
00:52:23,392 --> 00:52:31,314
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in this iTunes world now where it's very easy to buy the one song that you like, and a lot of people don't ever take the time to listen to the entire album.

889
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:36,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So I find it kind of interesting the rock band is kind of going this route where they're standing behind the albums in a way, you know?

890
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:38,983
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

891
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:56,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess when you think about, well, in the classics, that's when the albums were really albums.

892
00:52:56,169 --> 00:52:57,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's not so surprising.

893
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:58,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

894
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:15,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, and I also think that it's sad that we really don't have albums as a big format anymore just because from an artistic point of view, keep in mind what all went into making an album, you know, with your cover and everything and you had all the publishing.

895
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:19,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that actually is sort of a...

896
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:24,157
[SPEAKER_05]: A neat thing as far as its nostalgic value.

897
00:53:24,397 --> 00:53:25,758
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

898
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:26,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at chat comments.

899
00:53:26,919 --> 00:53:30,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitstuns in chat.orangelunchradio.com says, When I download stuff, I get the whole album.

900
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:33,843
[SPEAKER_02]: J-Rod says, Rock band needs more modern metal.

901
00:53:34,703 --> 00:53:37,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says, I'm an iTunes boy living in an iTunes world.

902
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:43,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Sephiroth1215 says, I'm waiting for Nevermind to come out.

903
00:53:43,408 --> 00:53:44,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get the whole album for that.

904
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:46,830
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

905
00:53:48,419 --> 00:53:51,743
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be classic, classic rock, especially for this generation.

906
00:53:51,783 --> 00:53:54,766
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that early 90s stuff is really the defining classic rock.

907
00:53:54,806 --> 00:53:55,587
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting.

908
00:53:56,048 --> 00:53:57,209
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

909
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:58,170
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

910
00:53:58,571 --> 00:53:58,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

911
00:53:59,311 --> 00:53:59,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

912
00:53:59,752 --> 00:54:00,413
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting old.

913
00:54:01,053 --> 00:54:01,874
[SPEAKER_02]: We ain't getting any younger.

914
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:08,450
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, while we age, we have a lot of new games and things coming out around the world to look forward to, so let's do some release dates.

915
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this week, actually, there's going to be something pretty cool.

916
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:17,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, about a week from now, there'll be something pretty cool, because it's going to be coming out on Sunday.

917
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:23,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Mario Kart Wii, finally coming out in the U.S., so you can take a look at that.

918
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:24,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good game.

919
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:29,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, other things coming out other than Mario Kart Wii...

920
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:36,797
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a game actually also on the Wii, little known, Heavenly Guardian.

921
00:54:37,397 --> 00:54:42,960
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty cheap game, and it's kind of like a side-scroller shooter game, so that's kind of cool.

922
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:54,846
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also NBA Ballers Chosen One, which is coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, kind of a one-on-one, two-on-two basketball game.

923
00:54:56,387 --> 00:54:57,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, there's also...

924
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:03,556
[SPEAKER_00]: RiverKingMysticValley

925
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:07,864
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's like a fishing game, fishing RPG.

926
00:55:07,884 --> 00:55:12,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's what Harvest Moon is to farming, this is to fishing.

927
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:15,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Battle of the Bands coming out on the Wii.

928
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:21,975
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that music game that doesn't require instruments but you have different mashups of music genres in there.

929
00:55:23,857 --> 00:55:24,878
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of cool.

930
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:27,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild Earth African Safari.

931
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,060
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

932
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,483
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Pokemon Snap type of game that's for the Wii.

933
00:55:31,963 --> 00:55:33,865
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Africa before Africa.

934
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:35,680
[SPEAKER_00]: The World Ends With You James Bond

935
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:55,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that came up on last week's show.

936
00:55:55,702 --> 00:55:57,323
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about The World Ends With You.

937
00:55:57,923 --> 00:55:58,523
[SPEAKER_02]: James Bond.

938
00:55:58,543 --> 00:56:00,264
[SPEAKER_02]: This totally sounds like a Bond.

939
00:56:00,364 --> 00:56:02,365
[SPEAKER_00]: This game you may want to skip.

940
00:56:02,685 --> 00:56:05,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Target Terror by Konami.

941
00:56:05,026 --> 00:56:07,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently one of the ugliest games for the Wii.

942
00:56:07,727 --> 00:56:13,969
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a game that came out of the arcades circa 1990s with wonderful mocap technology.

943
00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:17,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of think of like Area 51 and Maximum Force type things.

944
00:56:18,581 --> 00:56:23,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Chameleon on PSP Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 FES Dream Pinball 3D

945
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Lineage 2, Call of Duty 4, and I believe that's actually it.

946
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:40,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that is it.

947
00:56:56,874 --> 00:57:00,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Jonathan F. in chat just said something I've been wondering about for the longest time.

948
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:04,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantasy Star Universe, Ambition of the Illuminous, Max Attack G begins, I guess, this week.

949
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Play the old PSO stages in PSU.

950
00:57:07,202 --> 00:57:11,225
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the whole reason I downloaded Ambition of the Illuminous, not realizing they weren't there yet.

951
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:14,168
[SPEAKER_02]: So, God, I hope you can do that at low level.

952
00:57:14,188 --> 00:57:16,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I don't have to level, like, 100 to play them.

953
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:17,250
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will if I have to.

954
00:57:18,191 --> 00:57:19,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss caves that much.

955
00:57:20,152 --> 00:57:23,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't miss caves and those damn little plants that kept paralyzing you all the time?

956
00:57:25,174 --> 00:57:28,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, traveling to Japan and looking at some of the releases over there.

957
00:57:28,715 --> 00:57:31,476
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a war fan, hey, Xbox 360 is where it's at this week.

958
00:57:31,516 --> 00:57:38,058
[SPEAKER_02]: On April 24th, Frontline's Fuel of War and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 both come out in Japan.

959
00:57:38,098 --> 00:57:42,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you like those war shooting tech games, you might have fun with that.

960
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:55,202
[SPEAKER_02]: In PlayStation 3, Senjo no Valkyria comes out as well from Sega this week in Japan, as well as another version of Rainbow Six Vegas, except that's just a price reduction on the PlayStation 3.

961
00:57:56,282 --> 00:57:58,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to figure out what this Valkyrie game is here.

962
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:02,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a game that we're getting over here in the fall.

963
00:58:03,323 --> 00:58:04,824
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a turn-based RPG.

964
00:58:04,864 --> 00:58:10,085
[SPEAKER_02]: It combines strategy with action, and you proceed in the game like it's a history book.

965
00:58:10,385 --> 00:58:10,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Valkyrie Profile

966
00:58:26,923 --> 00:58:28,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like you make history.

967
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:29,405
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds kind of interesting.

968
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:38,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, coming out on other systems, going over to the Nintendo Wii coming out this week, the white GameCube controller we talked about last week.

969
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:42,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Also coming out, Osuji Sentai Clean Keeper.

970
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:45,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

971
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,691
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a weird Captain Planet thing.

972
00:59:16,992 --> 00:59:17,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, hold on.

973
00:59:18,693 --> 00:59:33,964
[SPEAKER_02]: The fairy mentions that there is a queen of pollution in school seeking to bring the school down by dirtying it and the only way to stop her is to form the Clean Keeper Squad by rescuing all the cleaning fairies and finding the girls who can see and bond with these fairies.

974
00:59:34,645 --> 00:59:36,686
[SPEAKER_00]: This game sounds badass.

975
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:39,128
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to capture girls and clean them.

976
00:59:43,149 --> 00:59:45,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Osuji Sentai Clean Keeper H2O Edelbloom

977
01:00:06,889 --> 01:00:09,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Prism Arc Awake also comes out.

978
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:12,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of other games get price reductions.

979
01:00:13,373 --> 01:00:21,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Furayaki, Everybody's Golf 4, and Rim Runners gets a price reduction.

980
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:23,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, that's the name of a game.

981
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Rim Rummers.

982
01:00:28,322 --> 01:00:29,003
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so immature.

983
01:00:29,623 --> 01:00:30,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo DS.

984
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:39,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Days of Memories 2, Ako de Pon, Ikisama Horiyuki, Puzzle Mate, Summon Night,

985
01:00:57,315 --> 01:00:58,535
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big week for DS.

986
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:05,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Yataman DS, Bikiriori Dokiri Daisukisen de Koron.

987
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:10,658
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of part of the charm of this segment is getting to hear me butcher such Japanese names.

988
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,198
[SPEAKER_02]: How about PSP?

989
01:01:12,258 --> 01:01:15,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see real quick if there's anything on PSP to match the amount of stuff coming out on DS this week.

990
01:01:15,979 --> 01:01:17,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there is quite a bit this week.

991
01:01:17,919 --> 01:01:18,919
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it's movies.

992
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I Am Legend you can finally pick up.

993
01:01:23,926 --> 01:01:27,590
[SPEAKER_02]: SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 makes its way to Asia.

994
01:01:28,511 --> 01:01:31,134
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Vampire Chronicle gets a price reduction?

995
01:01:31,595 --> 01:01:32,095
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

996
01:01:33,117 --> 01:01:34,558
[SPEAKER_02]: That's release dates for Japan.

997
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:35,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move over to Europe.

998
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:58,121
[SPEAKER_05]: NBA Ballers, Chosen One on the 25th for Xbox 360, Nitro Bike on PS2, Turok, PDC World Championship, Dart 2008, SingStar Summer Party, Wii Fit, that's good, and Grand Theft Auto 4 on the 29th.

999
01:01:58,161 --> 01:01:58,362
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1000
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:02,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Barf!

1001
01:02:02,245 --> 01:02:02,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Barf!

1002
01:02:26,761 --> 01:02:32,354
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Genesis, we get a cool RPG, Fancy Star 3 Generations of Doom.

1003
01:02:33,898 --> 01:02:34,319
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.

1004
01:02:35,361 --> 01:02:35,682
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1005
01:02:36,493 --> 01:02:37,714
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1006
01:02:58,464 --> 01:03:01,986
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do have as downloadable content as we found out this week.

1007
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:05,828
[SPEAKER_02]: The five bonus songs on the Wii are just download songs from the other systems.

1008
01:03:06,288 --> 01:03:17,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirty Little Secret by the All-American Rejects, Don't Look Back in Anger by Oasis, Rome by the B-52s, Rockaway Beach by the Ramones, and you don't have to turn out the red light for Roxanne by the police.

1009
01:03:18,755 --> 01:03:19,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Good songs!

1010
01:03:20,135 --> 01:03:23,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually own two of those five as download songs, and I don't even own that many songs.

1011
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:24,698
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1012
01:03:25,738 --> 01:03:35,761
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit disappointing to some that they are just simply download songs from the other systems, but they will be right there on the Wii disc to offset the fact that you won't be able to download anything else for now, for a while.

1013
01:03:37,442 --> 01:03:41,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've got a whole bunch of downloadable content for the week.

1035
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever Kung Fu Panda is.

1036
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:55,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds pretty awesome.

1037
01:05:55,449 --> 01:05:55,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

1038
01:05:56,189 --> 01:05:57,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Kung Fu Panda?

1039
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:01,191
[SPEAKER_00]: That's based on the Jack Black film, I think.

1040

1042
01:06:30,045 --> 01:06:31,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have Message in a Bottle stuck in my head.

1043
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:35,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Message in a Bottle.

1044
01:06:35,629 --> 01:06:37,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Message in a Bottle.

1045
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,091
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my favorite police song ever.

1046
01:06:39,631 --> 01:06:40,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

1047
01:06:41,773 --> 01:06:42,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ferret agrees too.

1048
01:06:44,515 --> 01:06:45,695
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not Message in a Bottle.

1049
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:46,636
[SPEAKER_02]: That was gibberish.

1050
01:06:47,056 --> 01:06:48,157
[SPEAKER_05]: That was gibberish and a ferret.

1051
01:06:48,517 --> 01:06:54,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so we know that Mario Kart is already out now in Japan and Europe.

1052
01:06:55,376 --> 01:06:56,497
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1053
01:07:12,586 --> 01:07:39,533
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's another, not really a game but a UMD video Bokudaki no Kajitsu and that actually translates to Only My Fruit and it's an erotic like hentai UMD video or game or something so that's kind of funny erotic PSP game beats out Mario Kart Wii if only they had more jubblies in Mario Kart Wii maybe

1054
01:07:41,277 --> 01:07:45,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo is, uh, sending out an SOS about right now.

1055
01:07:47,952 --> 01:07:49,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, how to get beaten by porn.

1056
01:07:49,693 --> 01:07:52,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is this like something that's really, really popular in Japan or something?

1057
01:07:52,974 --> 01:07:53,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Akihabara.

1058
01:07:55,495 --> 01:07:59,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, but this is only one store's chart, right?

1059
01:07:59,136 --> 01:08:00,696
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't like the whole country's chart.

1060
01:08:00,716 --> 01:08:01,497
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Akihabara.

1061
01:08:01,717 --> 01:08:08,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so maybe it's a little bit much to say that OMG, Mario Kart Wii gets its butt kicked by porn in the entirety of Japan.

1062
01:08:08,879 --> 01:08:09,699
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just one store.

1063
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:12,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe this is the only store where you can buy this particular game.

1064
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:16,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of like how here, you know, Walmarts and Targets don't carry certain games, right?

1065
01:08:17,182 --> 01:08:18,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe.

1066
01:08:18,183 --> 01:08:20,125
[SPEAKER_00]: If they only carried more porn games, you know.

1067
01:08:22,467 --> 01:08:22,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1068
01:08:23,107 --> 01:08:23,427
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1069
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:51,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's only announced for Japan right now, but if this sells over in Japan, I don't see why they wouldn't bring this over here.

1070
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:56,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, Resident Evil 4, we didn't do too bad, so why the hell not?

1071
01:08:59,196 --> 01:08:59,616
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

1072
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:09,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there has been an ESRB game rating released because of blood and fantasy violence, and it's set for something on the Nintendo DS.

1073
01:09:10,263 --> 01:09:11,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we guess what that is?

1074
01:09:12,305 --> 01:09:12,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

1075
01:09:13,581 --> 01:09:20,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Castlevania Order of Ecclesia All games have fantasy violence But the best ones have real violence

1076
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:40,561
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them have real violence.

1077
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:42,123
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all fantasy.

1078
01:09:42,643 --> 01:09:49,731
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all you perceiving one character beating up another, but it's just fucking data.

1079
01:09:50,612 --> 01:09:51,273
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

1080
01:09:51,413 --> 01:09:54,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Whattheyplay.com Snap will have real violence.

1081
01:09:54,036 --> 01:09:54,597
[SPEAKER_05]: But will it blend?

1082
01:09:54,617 --> 01:09:55,858
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope.

1083
01:09:55,938 --> 01:09:56,299
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope.

1084
01:09:57,728 --> 01:10:00,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it'll blend since it's an idea.

1085
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:03,853
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can get ideas into a blender.

1086
01:10:04,654 --> 01:10:05,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Just yet.

1087
01:10:05,594 --> 01:10:09,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a new blender with idea blending capabilities.

1088
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:10,338
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.

1089
01:10:13,201 --> 01:10:14,241
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this will blend.

1090
01:10:14,281 --> 01:10:15,643
[SPEAKER_00]: It may blend on the Wii.

1091
01:10:16,203 --> 01:10:24,410
[SPEAKER_00]: But apparently Namco has announced another, yes, there is actually another already, cheerleader game for the Wii.

1092
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:25,771
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Wii Cheer.

1093
01:10:26,251 --> 01:10:27,052
[SPEAKER_00]: It features...

1094
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:32,835
[SPEAKER_00]: and cartoony cheerleaders jumping around and stuff.

1095
01:10:32,935 --> 01:10:38,519
[SPEAKER_00]: And you apparently use the game, each one of your pom-poms, I guess, in the game is actually a Wii remote.

1096
01:10:38,559 --> 01:10:47,825
[SPEAKER_00]: So you use two Wii remotes and kind of think like a Wii version of yet another cheering game, Oh and Done, or Elite Beat Agents.

1097
01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:50,247
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like that is how you play the game.

1098
01:10:51,308 --> 01:10:54,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be interested in this if they had just called it Bring It On, the game.

1099
01:10:56,570 --> 01:11:18,472
[SPEAKER_00]: and it forces you to use spirit fingers spirit fingers that movie was was incredible I don't know that's the only way you're allowed to finish that sentence don't get me wrong this is this is like I guess a cool idea for girls because um the video the trailer showed girls playing this game why's it gotta be an only a girl game huh

1100
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:21,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because they showed little girls playing the game.

1101
01:11:21,434 --> 01:11:23,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to play a game that little girls play?

1102
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.

1103
01:11:26,016 --> 01:11:26,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

1104
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:30,478
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of... I don't think I can play this game.

1105
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:32,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feel dirty playing this game.

1106
01:11:33,419 --> 01:11:35,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I got to look at some of this trailer.

1107
01:11:37,781 --> 01:11:40,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, little girls dancing and happy.

1108
01:11:42,523 --> 01:11:44,263
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes horrible radio.

1109
01:11:44,303 --> 01:11:45,764
[SPEAKER_02]: They butcher the songs, by the way.

1110
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:52,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're probably going to be all horrible cover versions.

1111
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:57,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Create your own cheerleader.

1112
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, custom mode.

1113
01:11:58,621 --> 01:11:59,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

1114
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,721
[SPEAKER_02]: You like that, don't you?

1115
01:12:01,881 --> 01:12:03,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd probably make a cheerleader.

1116
01:12:03,482 --> 01:12:04,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll end the torture for our chat.

1117
01:12:04,902 --> 01:12:07,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Killer or something.

1118
01:12:07,762 --> 01:12:09,363
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like they're all having fun.

1119
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,123
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what games are all about, right?

1120
01:12:12,143 --> 01:12:14,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're paid to look like they're having fun.

1121
01:12:15,384 --> 01:12:16,364
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the game called again?

1122
01:12:17,014 --> 01:12:17,734
[SPEAKER_02]: We cheer.

1123
01:12:18,014 --> 01:12:18,734
[SPEAKER_05]: We cheer.

1124
01:12:19,615 --> 01:12:20,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like we ski.

1125
01:12:22,115 --> 01:12:22,795
[SPEAKER_05]: We cheer.

1126
01:12:22,955 --> 01:12:24,856
[SPEAKER_02]: We starve ourselves to fit in the outfit.

1127
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:28,057
[SPEAKER_00]: They do kind of look like they have starved themselves.

1128
01:12:28,737 --> 01:12:29,437
[SPEAKER_02]: They're children.

1129
01:12:30,377 --> 01:12:30,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice.

1130
01:12:31,397 --> 01:12:32,878
[SPEAKER_05]: They're children on TV.

1131
01:12:33,158 --> 01:12:38,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll have the, you know, we need to get to Dallas, the WDS Dallas sequel for the game.

1132
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:45,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireboma says Sky sold as soon as he hears that song.

1133
01:12:46,109 --> 01:12:46,909
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a good song.

1134
01:12:47,149 --> 01:12:48,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't like that song?

1135
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:49,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't it feel good?

1136
01:12:50,629 --> 01:12:52,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually am really annoyed by that song.

1137
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:56,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, poop on you.

1138
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:58,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Debbie Downer.

1139
01:13:04,972 --> 01:13:08,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Channel Z says they show a boy playing at the end of the WeCheer video.

1140
01:13:08,353 --> 01:13:09,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Boys can be cheerleaders.

1141
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:10,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

1142
01:13:11,437 --> 01:13:12,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart boys are cheerleaders.

1143
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:14,760
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?

1144
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:15,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1145
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they get to put their hands up the girls' skirts all day long.

1146
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:22,786
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1147
01:13:23,006 --> 01:13:23,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Touche.

1148
01:13:24,607 --> 01:13:24,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1149
01:13:24,887 --> 01:13:25,868
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you respond to that?

1150
01:13:25,928 --> 01:13:26,429
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't.

1151
01:13:26,589 --> 01:13:27,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1152
01:13:27,729 --> 01:13:28,010
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1153
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:29,771
[SPEAKER_02]: If you saw Bring It On, you'd know this.

1154
01:13:29,831 --> 01:13:32,773
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the gay cheerleader who was, you know, cheerleading because he was gay.

1155
01:13:33,054 --> 01:13:36,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the cheerleader who was, you know, just there to hit on all the women.

1156
01:13:37,377 --> 01:13:37,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the thing.

1157
01:13:38,017 --> 01:13:40,079
[SPEAKER_00]: He can hit on all the women, but he ain't going to get any of them.

1158
01:13:41,368 --> 01:13:41,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1159
01:13:44,814 --> 01:13:46,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look at another game here.

1160
01:13:46,977 --> 01:13:48,920
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Okami on the Wii.

1161
01:13:49,481 --> 01:13:52,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And the funny thing about Okami on the Wii is that...

1162
01:13:53,837 --> 01:13:53,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I.G.N.

1163
01:14:18,914 --> 01:14:27,878
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, Capcom lifted the IGN art from the website or whatever to make the Wii box art for Okami.

1164
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:30,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that funny?

1165
01:14:31,019 --> 01:14:33,260
[SPEAKER_02]: They stole their own artwork from a website.

1166
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really funny.

1167
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:35,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

1168
01:14:37,564 --> 01:14:40,345
[SPEAKER_02]: and apparently it's legit.

1169
01:14:40,485 --> 01:14:42,646
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go look at a box for this game and it's there.

1170
01:14:42,967 --> 01:14:50,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they'll be able to fix it at one point but at some point later but apparently the press releases that have gone out already have this on there.

1171
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,170
[SPEAKER_02]: People have confirmed it.

1172
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:52,631
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

1173
01:14:53,992 --> 01:14:56,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee in chat says Capcom googled their own box art.

1174
01:14:56,573 --> 01:14:57,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they did.

1175
01:14:59,214 --> 01:14:59,694
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

1176
01:14:59,874 --> 01:15:00,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's getting fired.

1177
01:15:01,135 --> 01:15:02,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone totally got fired.

1178
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:03,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha.

1179
01:15:04,298 --> 01:15:15,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're about ready to take a break here and go from Part A to Part B, but first, it just would not be an Orange Launch Radio Part A if we did not pay tribute to video game classics.

1180
01:15:15,654 --> 01:15:19,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do that with a little segment here on the show called our Classic Video Game of the Week.

1181
01:15:22,691 --> 01:15:28,995
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura goes through her vast archives of video games and picks out one classic for you all to pay respect to.

1182
01:15:29,455 --> 01:15:30,876
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it going to be this week, DarkSakura?

1183
01:15:31,196 --> 01:15:31,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Strider.

1184
01:15:33,037 --> 01:15:34,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitches better recognize.

1185
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, the only copy of the first level that I could find was the Genesis version.

1186
01:15:41,442 --> 01:15:45,665
[SPEAKER_05]: However, this was one of the first of their eight meg titles that they brought out.

1187
01:15:46,205 --> 01:15:48,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you can't start it past where the music was.

1188
01:15:48,807 --> 01:15:49,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, do I need to start at the very beginning?

1189
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:50,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

1190
01:15:53,962 --> 01:15:54,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right there.

1191
01:15:56,224 --> 01:15:57,105
[SPEAKER_03]: This is classic.

1192
01:15:57,926 --> 01:16:14,342
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, this is the game that actually in Japan was called Strider Yu-Yu, and it gave us the character from Marvel vs. Capcom, but basically it's a platformer, and it's actually very interesting because all of the in-between areas...

1193
01:16:15,223 --> 01:16:22,709
[SPEAKER_05]: are basically the characters speaking their native languages, but they're speaking them to each other and can apparently understand everybody else.

1194
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:25,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they have translators in the future like that.

1195
01:16:26,793 --> 01:16:43,266
[SPEAKER_05]: But you go through different levels, and the first one starts off, you have to fight this guy called Grandmaster Mayo, and you're going through different areas, like you start off in the Soviet Union, the next one is, I think the next level is in Siberia,

1196
01:16:43,906 --> 01:16:59,640
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the Amazon Rainforest, you've got a big platform in space, and actually this is my favorite level to do because as you're going through that, you are on the ground and then gravity reverses and you're in other areas and then you have to fight this thing that you move in a circle around.

1197
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:29,660
[SPEAKER_05]: But his weapon is called a cipher, which is like a swinging tonfa-style blade, but as you get power-ups, it'll extend further, and he'll get his little mechanical animal buddies to help him out, like a falcon, and a big saber-toothed tiger, and his little things that... Okay, I don't think they actually got names until Marvel vs. Capcom came out, but the little tiny things were called Ouroboros, but that was also one of the bosses of the game, too.

1198
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:34,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, okay, the stages in this was, um, St.

1199
01:17:34,365 --> 01:17:40,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Petersburg, um, the Siberian Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship, um, Amazon, and, um, the Third Moon.

1200
01:17:40,993 --> 01:17:43,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a really kind of an epic sort of game.

1201
01:17:44,156 --> 01:17:49,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the thing about the, um, in-between areas is that, like, um...

1202
01:17:50,243 --> 01:18:04,447
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, after you fight, there's the area where you fight three girls as the bosses, and one of them is Pompu, who was also one of the helper characters in Marvel vs. Capcom, but she speaks Chinese.

1203
01:18:05,287 --> 01:18:07,448
[SPEAKER_05]: The bounty hunter guy speaks English.

1204
01:18:07,508 --> 01:18:10,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I see they didn't do it on the...

1205
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:15,900
[SPEAKER_05]: on the Genesis one, the arcade one.

1206
01:18:17,021 --> 01:18:37,487
[SPEAKER_05]: It also, there were other versions that came out, like the one that we were listening to was the Genesis one, but it's been on the Amiga, the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and there's been a Master System version and a Sharp X68000 version.

1207
01:18:37,527 --> 01:18:37,807
[SPEAKER_05]: There was...

1208
01:18:43,951 --> 01:18:49,357
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have a burn of this, the version that was going to be Super Graphics CD.

1209
01:18:53,402 --> 01:18:59,449
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have a copy of the proto for it, but we don't have the arcade card to play it with.

1210
01:19:03,013 --> 01:19:07,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell people that there is a Nintendo version.

1211
01:19:09,181 --> 01:19:18,093
[SPEAKER_05]: However, just to let people know, that was actually based off of the Strider comics that came out in Japan and is not anything like...

1212
01:19:19,294 --> 01:19:29,861
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting because when I, you know, I didn't have a Genesis growing up, we only had a Nintendo, but I do remember Strider on the Nintendo, and I love that game, but it is completely different than this game.

1213
01:19:30,161 --> 01:19:34,604
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is more of like a platformer, whereas Strider on the NES was a bit more like adventure.

1214
01:19:35,024 --> 01:19:40,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a bit more Bionic Commando, and that fucking triangle jump made me want to kill people.

1215
01:19:41,108 --> 01:19:46,871
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it's so interesting that you have both games that were Strider, yet they were so completely freaking different.

1216
01:19:46,911 --> 01:19:47,692
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very interesting.

1217
01:19:47,952 --> 01:20:00,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, part of the reason with this was they were actually going to leave out the, um, as far as I'm aware, now this is coming from my husband, and for anyone who kept up on older video game sites, my husband used to run one called Neo Strider Strider Zone.

1218
01:20:00,781 --> 01:20:03,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did all, I, you know, fixed all of his graphics on it for him.

1219
01:20:04,624 --> 01:20:05,145
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um...

1220
01:20:06,185 --> 01:20:09,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan is full of Strider trivia.

1221
01:20:09,746 --> 01:20:17,128
[SPEAKER_05]: When they were first going to bring it out on Genesis slash Mega Drive, there wasn't enough memory to accommodate the full game.

1222
01:20:17,148 --> 01:20:21,830
[SPEAKER_05]: They were going to leave out the Amazon level and ended up just creating their 8MB cartridges to...

1223
01:20:24,504 --> 01:20:28,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to say, it's pretty damn close to arcade perfect.

1224
01:20:41,866 --> 01:20:43,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Journey from Darkness, Strider Returns

1225
01:21:06,678 --> 01:21:11,984
[SPEAKER_05]: and, um, a lot, it plays basically just like Striders, a lot of the same type of game.

1226
01:21:12,524 --> 01:21:20,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it did get a really good sequel called Strider 2, which was really freaking good, um, but that'll be touched on at a later date.

1227
01:21:22,972 --> 01:21:25,173
[SPEAKER_02]: So Strider 2 is different than Strider Returns?

1228
01:21:26,093 --> 01:21:30,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Strider Returns was more of a... It was just awful.

1229
01:21:32,055 --> 01:21:35,376
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, the story that it brought up was actually retconned because of Strider 2.

1230
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:37,157
[SPEAKER_05]: The real Strider 2 that came out.

1231
01:21:38,277 --> 01:21:42,618
[SPEAKER_05]: and the one that came out was, I think, a worthy sequel.

1232
01:21:42,838 --> 01:21:43,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's the Amazon level.

1233
01:21:45,019 --> 01:21:48,619
[SPEAKER_05]: When you fight the girls that... This is someone doing a speedrun of the game.

1234
01:21:49,139 --> 01:21:52,980
[SPEAKER_02]: They use the emulator cheats, though, but it's a speedrun in seven and a half minutes.

1235
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,961
[SPEAKER_05]: He's fighting the half-naked Amazon ladies.

1236
01:21:55,121 --> 01:21:55,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot.

1237
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:56,441
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, there you have it.

1238
01:21:56,461 --> 01:22:03,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Your classic game of the week, Strider, for the arcade and the Genesis or Mega Drive, whatever region you happen to live in.

1239
01:22:04,163 --> 01:22:04,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

1240
01:22:06,044 --> 01:22:06,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Respect the Classics.

1241
01:22:28,604 --> 01:22:33,350
[SPEAKER_05]: that had the NES version of Strider, Bionic Commando, and Mighty Final Fight.

1242
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:36,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's also another way that people can check it out.

1243
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:37,174
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, very cool.

1244
01:22:37,194 --> 01:22:40,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides that, Mighty Final Fight is just fun, too.

1245
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of silly fun.

1246
01:22:42,581 --> 01:22:44,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically chibi Final Fight.

1247
01:22:44,323 --> 01:22:45,484
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it had Guy in it, right?

1248
01:22:45,704 --> 01:22:47,266
[SPEAKER_02]: It did, yeah.

1249
01:22:47,386 --> 01:22:48,608
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I had Final Fight Guy.

1250
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:51,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1251
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Plenty more to come in Part B tonight.

1252
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:56,764
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about some more Grand Theft Auto news.

1253
01:22:56,824 --> 01:22:57,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you believe it?

1254
01:22:57,384 --> 01:22:57,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stuff.

1255
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:00,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about Bionic Commando rearmed a little bit as well.

1256
01:23:00,746 --> 01:23:03,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody dared to say that Wii games look like crap.

1257
01:23:03,528 --> 01:23:04,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would have thought?

1258
01:23:04,348 --> 01:23:07,370
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk all about that in Part B right after a quick break.

1259
01:23:08,031 --> 01:23:12,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1260
01:23:13,454 --> 01:23:17,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
