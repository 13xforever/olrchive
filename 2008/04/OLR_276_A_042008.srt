00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,360
Tonight, April 20th, 2008, Rock Band is set to get its first full albums, Soul Caliber

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,240
the Original is headed to Xbox Live Arcade, and did a recent video game release borrow

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,600
its box art from the internet.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,480
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Radio.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,840
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,600
and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,160
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
Hi.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
And how are you, Jamie?

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,480
I'm a little tired.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,800
I'm sorry to hear about the tiredness.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,040
I can tell you're quiet and you seem like your energy is depleted a little bit.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,360
Well, a happy late birthday to you, Ms. Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,680
I know this weekend was your birthday and I guess you're just too exhausted from all

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
the partying, huh?

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,800
I went to San Francisco for Sakura Matsuri and I was very sad because it was so windy

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,000
that all the blossoms had been blown off of the trees except for a few.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh no.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,040
But I did a lot of shopping and they changed Kinokuniya.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
Hmm.

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,720
It has a whole anime manga stuff section downstairs.

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
Interesting.

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,720
But that's where all the fanboys were but that's also where all the Copic markers and

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,680
the leader pads were so I had to go down there.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
I noticed you brought back a video game magazine, All in Japanese.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
It looks like Famitsu magazine.

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,760
I brought back last month's issue of Famitsu.

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Nice.

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,760
And I brought back the first issue of the Blue Dragon manga which is interesting.

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,120
Yeah, I was thumbing through it and I'm like, this looks to have nothing in common with

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
the video games.

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,240
It's not done by Toriyama.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,480
Interesting.

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,600
And I brought back a bunch of comics.

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Cool, cool.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,880
We noticed you're getting a lot of belated happy birthdays in our chat room.

39
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,760
Thank you everybody else in the chat room.

40
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,640
And if you want to join us, chat.orangelaungeradio.com is the place to be even though we do tape

41
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,220
live on all games radio, we do use a separate chat room still, our old chat room, so chat.orangelaungeradio.com

42
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,200
or if you're already on the game search network, it's channel Orange Lounge.

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,600
And I got pie today but I haven't eaten any of it.

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,960
Birthday pie instead of birthday cake?

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,120
Because my boss baked me a cake on Friday.

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,160
Well, not on Friday, but she brought me homemade carrot cake because carrot cake is my favorite

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
cake.

48
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Nice.

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
She baked me a cake.

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
I'm so happy.

51
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,400
That's even better than giving you a cookie is baking you a cake.

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I got pie today.

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Nice.

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
What kind of pie?

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
I did eat a lot of cookies though.

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
I had Samoas.

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
I love Samoas.

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
I ate them.

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,240
They were cold too and had Mars Bars eggs and Nestle Black Magic eggs.

60
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Oh, you got to stop talking.

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,640
I miss all these foods ever since I had to go on the low fat diet thanks to the pancreas.

62
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Pie is good for you.

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
All right.

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
Let's move on.

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
It's full of vitamin banana.

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,560
Let's move over and say hello to Tech Master Loki who also joins us every week.

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Hello.

68
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
You're on Orange Lounge.

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
How are you?

70
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
I'm doing good.

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Any cookies or pie in your day?

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
No.

73
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Do you have an exciting weekend?

74
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Do anything fun?

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,400
I waited two hours to eat at Joe's Crab Shack yesterday, I guess.

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
No, that's not fun.

77
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Two hours?

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Two hours.

79
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,880
That must have been some damn good seafood.

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
No.

81
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
It was.

82
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,360
We were damn patient.

83
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,200
It's really popular here, though, in Sacramento, though, because it's on the river.

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
You went to look downtown.

85
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
It was on the river, right?

86
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
It was Saturday night.

87
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,540
It was during dinner rush and they had prom people there, so, you know, people are dumb.

88
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,480
I was out of town for four days.

89
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,800
I missed Jamie's birthday, sadly.

90
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,800
I was completely out of town since Thursday.

91
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,880
I did my yearly pilgrimage out to the middle of nowhere, also known as Mendocino, which

92
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,120
is up on the north coast of California.

93
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,560
Part of it's a vacation from, you know, life, but it's also a vacation from the internets

94
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,880
and everything because there's no phone connection out there.

95
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
There's no internet.

96
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
There's no nothing.

97
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Just the beach, hot tub.

98
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,440
Good times, except for the food poisoning I got that kept me in bed all day Saturday.

99
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
That kind of sucked.

100
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,600
Oh, well.

101
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,540
I did end up playing some video games, so I'll talk about that in a minute right after

102
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,320
we get to Dark Sakura's gaming week.

103
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,680
How was your gaming week?

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
It wasn't.

105
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,760
Well, other than Ragnarok, but I bought Famitsu and the Blue Dragon manga.

106
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:23,640
And we were supposed to hook up the Dreamcast.

107
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,320
We had talked about hooking up the Dreamcast so that I could play a couple of things that

108
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,240
I've been sort of having an itch to, but instead I downloaded ZSNES today.

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
The emulator.

110
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Nice.

111
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Because I want to finish Seiken Densetsu 3, and I think I know where my save file is.

112
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
It was at the Super Nintendo ROM you were most itching to finish?

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,560
Yeah, it was a pretty good RPG.

114
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,720
Those are good times.

115
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,320
If you want to join our chat room and give comments on gaming weeks, chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com,

116
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,760
and for some reason people are commenting on Joe's Crab Shack.

117
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,720
SSJ100Matt says, you ate at the Crab Shack on Passover?

118
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,840
Fired.

119
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,640
Somebody who didn't change their name, OLArmyRecruit2559 says, always with the ragnacrack.

120
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,780
Yeah, and your point is?

121
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,240
Did you ever sign up for the number two?

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,800
Solid Goomba, by the way.

123
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Oh, okay.

124
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,880
Did you ever sign up for the number two?

125
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,080
No, I'm going to wait until they have more than just menus translated.

126
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,720
Did you get some of the bugs worked out from the early releases?

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,440
Yeah, because I'd actually like to be able to do the quests, and I don't read Korean.

128
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Yet.

129
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:39,640
Amazingly enough, know how Korean is read, you know, how the characters are arranged,

130
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,120
but I do not actually read any Korean.

131
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Sorry.

132
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
It's alright.

133
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Nobody's perfect.

134
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
Alright, let's move on over to Loki.

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,520
Was there any Korean in your gaming week?

136
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
No.

137
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Oh, then what was there?

138
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,040
I don't think.

139
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,680
I played Omega 5, actually.

140
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
I was downloading some Xbox Live Arcade games.

141
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
I downloaded Ikaruga, but I never got the chance to play it.

142
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,880
I did play, actually I played the demo of, what was it, I don't remember.

143
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Anyways.

144
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,240
What was the new release this week, because I was out?

145
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,680
Rocky and Bullwinkle, and Battlezone.

146
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,320
Oh, that's right, the minigame thing.

147
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,200
I wanted to check that out.

148
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I gotta catch up.

149
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,240
I heard that it sucked, but whatever.

150
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,880
I'm actually kind of excited there's another game out there that uses the webcam, other

151
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,080
than Totem Ball.

152
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,120
Totem Ball and Wouno.

153
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
And the other board game assortment.

154
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Really, we shouldn't be encouraging them.

155
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Alright, fine.

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Whatever.

157
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,600
So, yeah, I played Omega 5, and that was pretty cool.

158
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,280
It's just really hard, but that's kind of shooters for you, I guess.

159
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,000
I played lots of Mario Kart, and it's kind of, I don't know.

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,080
I guess it's just like the other Mario Karts.

161
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,640
I still really hate the fact that you can't do, you know, just four person, you know,

162
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,280
everybody against everybody, you know, types of battles.

163
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,260
It always has to be two on two teams, or one on three.

164
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,120
It's just, it's stupid.

165
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,520
It's just lazy that they don't have that in there.

166
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,200
But racing is pretty fun, so we've been doing that.

167
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,960
And then, more Saints Row, yes.

168
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,440
I played multiplayer, but then I realized something.

169
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,140
I don't know why I haven't realized it before, but I just found a code in the game that actually

170
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,320
makes this game totally different, and a lot fun in just the weirdest way.

171
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,200
I couldn't stop giggling, like, the entire time I was playing this.

172
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,160
The code is the Evil Cars code, and it makes all the cars in the game try to hunt you down

173
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
and kill you.

174
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Nice.

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,520
And so, you'll be running around or something, all of a sudden, this car comes from nowhere,

176
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,280
just flying through the air, just at your head, where they'll, like, be backing up towards

177
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
you.

178
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,440
And so, I made it, like, kind of a goal to, like, run from one end of the map to the next,

179
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
and it's fun.

180
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,760
And, in fact, I think I might actually do a little video for YouTube or something like

181
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,720
that, just something funny with, you know, that whole thing in there, because it's hilarious,

182
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,240
because you'll be hiding in, like, a little ditch or something, all of a sudden, all these

183
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,040
cars fly over your head and stuff, trying to kill you.

184
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,160
What's that, the plot of some movie?

185
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
I don't know.

186
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Carrie?

187
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
I don't know.

188
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Oh, no, not Carrie.

189
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
No, you're thinking...

190
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
That's, like, death proof.

191
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
No, not death proof.

192
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
I didn't see death proof.

193
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I know what you're thinking of.

194
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Ah, forget it.

195
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
The title of the movie.

196
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
But it sounds like fun.

197
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Can you do that in multiplayer?

198
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
No.

199
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Well, it would be...

200
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
It's people driving the cars.

201
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
They'll come after you.

202
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,600
If you take the people out of the cars, then they will stop moving.

203
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,720
It's not like the cars drive themselves, because that would be cool, too.

204
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,840
As I was going to say, it would be fun, like, that could be a fun multiplayer game, is,

205
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,200
like, who can live longer being chased, stalked by the cars?

206
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,960
So, what I've been doing, yeah, like I said, I put in, you know, the infinite ammo code,

207
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,520
the infinite sprint, and just go crazy, just run, you know, and it's pretty hard.

208
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
There's a lot of...

209
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,800
Especially when, like, you get onto the freeway and stuff, and there's trucks coming after

210
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,680
you, and cars are exploding because they keep running into each other.

211
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,680
I don't know.

212
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
It's pretty cool.

213
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,920
SSJ 100 Matt and Chad is chiming in with Death Race 3000, which he wants to point out is

214
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,160
being remade.

215
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,960
Is that the one where you get stalked by cars?

216
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Death Race?

217
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Uh, no.

218
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
That's the one that's just, like, Carmageddon.

219
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,480
No, I know the one you're thinking about.

220
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,640
It's a Stephen King movie.

221
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
It was Carrie!

222
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
It wasn't Carrie.

223
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
No, Carrie was the prom king.

224
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
Christine.

225
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Christine was the prom queen.

226
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,680
Christine was the one about the Plymouth Fury.

227
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Yes.

228
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,360
Well, there's another one I was thinking of where the cars were alive, and remember they

229
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,120
had that big rig with the clown face on the front?

230
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
It?

231
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
No, that wasn't it.

232
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Forget it.

233
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Forget it.

234
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
I don't remember what it's called.

235
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,120
I'm not sure if someone in chat will know, though, but yeah, it's cool, though.

236
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,040
The code just, you know, I guess a little bit more life for this next few weeks until

237
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,160
Grand Theft Auto IV comes out.

238
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,720
And you've been extending the life of Saints Row for quite some time.

239
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Oh, it's a great game.

240
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,280
You're one of the only people I know that still just doesn't shut up about this game

241
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
ever.

242
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
It's a great game.

243
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,720
I already have my Saints Row 2 preordered, so I can't wait to play that, too.

244
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,400
And, you know, and I don't, everyone's always, you know, pro Saints Row or pro Grand Theft

245
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,080
Auto and, you know, hating on the other ones.

246
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,440
I don't understand why you can't like both.

247
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,080
I love both games just equally, and they're good in different ways.

248
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,280
I mean, Grand Theft Auto tends to be more realistic, where Saints Row is just absolutely

249
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,000
batshit crazy with, you know, all sorts of, like, stuff that you wouldn't be able to do

250
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
in real life.

251
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's just great.

252
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
All right.

253
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,640
Chad.orangelsrader.com, some comments.

254
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,560
In response to the vision cam, vxjsonXV says Rayman's raving rabbits on the 360 use the

255
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
vision cam.

256
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,640
Unless, of course, you're talking about arcade scheduling.

257
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,520
And Brad from Pod Culture, Maximo Overdrive was the name of the movie with the cars there.

258
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Nice work.

259
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Nice work.

260
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,760
I was going to say about Rayman's Raving Rabbids, I was already worn out from the Wii version.

261
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,440
I never even bothered with the 360 version, because I was already kind of...

262
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,320
It's dirt cheap now, because that game didn't sell for crap, so...

263
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
I bet.

264
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Well, aren't they making a sequel, though?

265
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,920
They already made a sequel, Rayman's Raving Rabbids 2.

266
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,640
They came out on the Wii last year, around the holiday.

267
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,760
Apparently, I slept through it.

268
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Oh, well, you didn't miss much.

269
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
That's what I hear.

270
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,320
But they didn't do one for the 360, because, you know, the 360 one didn't sell at all.

271
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,720
Frisbee wants to know, can you use the vision cam on the computer?

272
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,400
Yes, you can, actually.

273
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,960
There's software available on Microsoft's website, but there's no audio with it, and

274
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,800
the quality's not great.

275
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
We actually...

276
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,320
I actually considered using it for our Justin TV feed, which is taping our show over Justin

277
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,800
TV, but the quality's not that great.

278
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,720
So that's why we don't use it.

279
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
But it does work.

280
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,460
It is a USB camera.

281
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,600
My gaming week, believe it or not, even though I was out of town for four days, I did get

282
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,520
the opportunity to play something new, because what is going into the wilderness with 10-year

283
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,360
friends staying in a cabin and not bringing along some party video game?

284
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,680
And I got to check out, for the first time, SingStar on the PlayStation 2.

285
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,400
And we've talked about this game an awful lot on the show, but I've always been more

286
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,760
of a karaoke revolution player.

287
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,880
That's the games I've had.

288
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,160
But we did get to check out SingStar, and the friend of ours had a variety.

289
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,800
He had SingStar 80s, SingStar Pop, and SingStar Amped.

290
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,520
And I guess one kind of cool thing is that you could switch back and forth between the

291
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,920
games without having to turn the whole dang thing off and on.

292
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,520
You just pop in another disc, and it loads the 30 songs from that disc.

293
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,400
Each game has about 30 songs.

294
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
SingStar was kind of fun.

295
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,840
I was more impressed with it than I thought I would be.

296
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,320
The only kind of bitches I have is that I didn't like the pitch gauging quite as much

297
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,160
as I do in Karaoke Revolution.

298
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,760
You can only see your pitch as you sing.

299
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,600
You don't see it any time you're saying something in the mic like you do in Karaoke Revolution.

300
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,960
You really kind of have to play both games to know what I'm talking about.

301
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,320
But if you play Karaoke Revolution, any time you make a sound, that arrow shows up on the

302
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,000
line to show you where you're at.

303
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,880
Whereas in SingStar, you don't see it until you're already singing.

304
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,040
But one thing I did like about SingStar is that it had pretty much all the real music

305
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,520
videos in the background as you're playing, which is kind of cool.

306
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,120
SingStar Pop has Aha!

307
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Take On Me.

308
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
So you know we had to play that just to see the video, because, I mean, how long?

309
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
When was the last time you saw Aha!

310
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Take On Me, the video?

311
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,600
I mean, it's got to be like years and years ago.

312
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,720
Some of our listeners are probably too young to even remember this video.

313
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Oh, Rob.

314
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
What?

315
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
About four days ago.

316
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
On YouTube or something?

317
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Yeah.

318
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,360
I hadn't seen it in years.

319
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
I hadn't seen it in years.

320
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
It's the one-hit-lender song.

321
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
I know, but still.

322
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,680
NessusJ100Matt says, Rob, in a cabin in the woods with SingStar, horror movie plotline

323
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
anyone?

324
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Kind of.

325
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,840
It could have been.

326
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,360
But there was a lot of songs I sang and had a pretty recognizable song list.

327
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,400
I actually think I might want to pick this game up on PlayStation 3, although, only it's

328
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
a party game.

329
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,480
I mean, you know how there's those video games that really only work when you have friends

330
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
over?

331
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
SingStar's definitely one of those games.

332
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Let's wait for the WiiWare one.

333
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
I think.

334
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
Yeah, maybe.

335
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Because why get a PlayStation 3 for the crappy game?

336
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,720
Well, I'm not going to get it just for that, but I like the fact that there's the music

337
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,280
videos, the actual music videos in the background, and the way it's put together is nice.

338
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,680
You know you just want it so you can film yourself and put yourself on that fake YouTube

339
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
thing.

340
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
Hell no.

341
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Hell no.

342
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
I'm not going to be able to exploit it.

343
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm not going to subject myself to that.

344
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,520
Can you imagine me getting on there singing Like a Prayer?

345
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,160
You know what happened last time I sang Like a Prayer or Karaoke?

346
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,880
Yeah, it's been like 10 years and I haven't lived it down, so not going to happen, sorry.

347
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,960
Or if it is, it's set to private or something.

348
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
We'll see.

349
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
So.

350
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Alright.

351
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,840
And that, and I played on the PSP, because William brought his PSP, he was playing the

352
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,880
shit out of Puzzle Quest most of the time, I played more Final Fantasy while I was sick

353
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,720
yesterday because I got food poisoning or something, I was sick all day yesterday.

354
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
One.

355
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,280
But it's the old school upgraded one on PSP, and I know I've talked about it on the show

356
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,320
before a while back, but man, the graphics are just beautiful on the PSP.

357
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,480
That's one thing the PSP does have going for it, is even though it has that little screen

358
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,800
and everything, you know, the graphics are high def and gorgeous.

359
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,680
That's one thing I really like about the PSP.

360
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,460
So I kind of want to go and pick out, get Final Fantasy II so I can play that on my

361
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,560
PSP and then if I want to borrow a Final Fantasy I will.

362
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,240
I didn't get into the II, it was, I don't know.

363
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
It's just different.

364
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Yeah.

365
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
It's just different.

366
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,920
Alright, well that's going to do it for our gaming week, so if you want to join in and

367
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,720
chime in on our gaming weeks or the news for tonight, you can join our chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

368
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,040
In the meantime, we do have some housekeeping for you guys.

369
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:11,280
One thing that kind of made me sad, you know we have the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki at orangelaungeradio.wiki.com,

370
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,160
and that is growing and growing and the people, the listeners that have been contributing

371
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,600
to that are doing an awesome job, it's great.

372
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,240
The bad news isn't about that.

373
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,880
The bad news is about Wikipedia, the main site, you know, wikipedia.org.

374
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,080
You know how Orange Lounge Radio had an article on there?

375
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
It got zapped.

376
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Somebody deleted it.

377
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
That's ridiculous.

378
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,000
But here's the thing, here's the thing I don't get.

379
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I always thought that articles when they got deleted from Wikipedia had to go through a

380
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,040
review phase for like articles pended for deletion or whatever and people are supposed

381
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
to review it.

382
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,240
So, when I looked at the deletion log, this guy named ClockworkSoul just nuked it.

383
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,560
He must be some admin on there.

384
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,560
He just nuked it and it said, web content does not indicate important significance.

385
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,120
Sad.

386
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Without any debate or argument, this guy just kind of did it.

387
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,520
Well, now you know who to go after.

388
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,440
Well, I mean, I think we all kind of knew it was coming anyway, but I mean, I don't

389
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
know, you know, we were...

390
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
A warning would have been nice.

391
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,920
I don't know, you know, we were one of the, we've been one of the longest running, you

392
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,080
know, when we had the Live Through Six Five station, we were one of the longest running

393
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,760
video game shows on the internet and, you know, now we're teamed up to probably form

394
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,600
one of the, with all games, probably the most experienced out there on the internet.

395
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,360
We were one of the first shows to use Skype, probably the first show to use Skype.

396
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,280
I actually, there's a part of me that thinks we were the first only show to use Skype and

397
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,760
I think I have the post to back that up.

398
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,380
Not to toot our horn too much, but I think there are things we have accomplished that

399
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,240
make it somewhat notable.

400
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,560
Well, what about the other websites referred to on there that are still, you know, there?

401
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
No.

402
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,680
First site to use a PSP-based website, first gaming thing to have a PSP spin-off site,

403
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
whatever.

404
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
So let's just put it back up.

405
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,280
Yeah, well, first and least updated.

406
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,520
Yeah, but I would just say if you guys are going to go back and recreate it, you just

407
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,640
might want to source some things, but you know, some of our news stories are on YouTube,

408
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,080
whatever, but oh well, we'll see what happens.

409
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,360
Regardless, we do have the OrangeLoungeRadio Wiki, which is like 10 times better anyway,

410
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:18,520
and nobody can delete that, so whatever, whatever, see if we care.

411
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,560
Our communities, we have Myspace.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, we have our Facebook community,

412
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,920
the OL Army, our live journal community, OrangeLounge, join us if you are on any of those communities.

413
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,660
Speaking of community, the All Games community has banded together for this.

414
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,600
This is awesome.

415
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,560
A limited edition Xbox 360 Elite based on Grand Theft Auto 4 is being given away.

416
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,640
Now we have to correct something that was said last week's show.

417
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,080
It is not one of the 500.

418
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
That's the bad news.

419
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,280
It is not one of the 500 Uber limited edition things that Mark Echo got one of when we were

420
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,440
making fun of him.

421
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,640
Where the other 499 went, we have no idea, but the good news is it's one of eight.

422
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,800
This is one of eight Xboxes being prepared with the whole customization specifically for

423
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,560
community websites as a Grand Theft Auto promotion.

424
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,800
All Games dot com has one, and OrangeLoungeRadio is coming together with a bunch of All Game

425
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,240
shows, including All Games Interactive, Dead Pixel Live, Bobby Black Wolf Show, Super Happy

426
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,120
Fun Time Show, Electric Sisterhood, Media Spective, Chatterbox Video Game Radio, Video

427
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,660
Game Outsiders, Ultimate Quest, Video Game Show, and Platformation, all coming together

428
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,320
to give away this Xbox 360 Elite.

429
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,280
If you want to win this, you can, because here's how it's going to work.

430
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,680
Each one of those affiliates I just named is going to send one finalist to the final

431
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,540
round, and here's how it works.

432
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,280
Every show is doing the same giveaway.

433
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,560
What's going to happen is that, okay, you know how Grand Theft Auto, one of the big

434
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,400
things in it is the radio stations that play, you know, Grand Theft Auto, huge on the soundtracks,

435
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
right?

436
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,040
You know, the last one had what, like a four-disc soundtrack, and they play all these songs.

437
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,180
Well, amidst the songs are fake DJs, and people tell me all the time I sound like that one

438
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,400
DJ in Grand Theft Auto, what the hell is his name?

439
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Laszlo.

440
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Yeah, Laszlo, okay.

441
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,520
Apparently, I sound like him.

442
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,720
I don't know if that's true or not.

443
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,880
I don't hear it, but I guess other people do.

444
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,480
So, you know how Grand Theft Auto has those DJs and stuff, they have little commercials

445
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,380
and fake DJ things.

446
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,960
We want you to be that, okay?

447
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Here's how it works.

448
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,920
You are going to submit a sound clip, it can't be any longer than two minutes, and it has

449
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,600
to be in the style of a Grand Theft Auto 4 radio station commercial, okay?

450
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,600
It can be a spoof ad, a segment, it can be a little song and dance, whatever.

451
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,040
It has to somehow relate to Orange Lounge Radio, okay?

452
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,120
That's the only thing.

453
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,600
It can be one of our in-jokes, and if you don't know any in-jokes, go check the wiki.

454
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,080
It can just say our name in it somewhere, whatever.

455
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,880
It just has to somehow relate to Orange Lounge Radio.

456
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,560
We will pick our favorites, like maybe our top five favorites.

457
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,760
The community will vote on the winner, which will then go on to the final round at AllGames.com

458
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,840
to win one of these eight rare 360s.

459
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
That's like, what?

460
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,640
Two minutes worth of voiceover for possibly an Xbox 360 Elite, one of eight being made

461
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,440
in the world.

462
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
So there you have it.

463
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,980
So the contest starts tonight, and if you have an MP3 you would like to submit to us,

464
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,980
you can send that on in.

465
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,180
You can either send it to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, or we will set up a special page on our forums

466
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,180
where you can send those in.

467
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,180
We'll pick our favorites.

468
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,640
The community will then vote on the winner, and then what happens is that the winning

469
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,080
bumper goes to All Games Radio, and All Games Radio will choose the ultimate winner out

470
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
of those.

471
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,400
But hey, the good news is, just for winning from us, you get an All Games t-shirt and

472
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,400
a $25 gift certificate to Shop.AllGames.com.

473
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,040
They sell video games, so that's like half off a video game right there, so go for it.

474
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Submission starts tonight.

475
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,720
You have to have these in by May 4th at midnight Pacific time, no late entries accepted.

476
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,360
I know many of you listen to several shows on AllGames.com.

477
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,400
You can submit multiple entries per multiple shows, but keep in mind you'll probably have

478
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,560
to do different bumpers because, you know, since we're making you have something related

479
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,020
to Orange Launch Radio, for example, Electric Sistahood would probably want something relating

480
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,580
to their show, and so on and so on.

481
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,080
We have the right to play your submission on our show, blah, blah, blah.

482
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,080
If one person should win multiple contests, a coin flip determines the winner.

483
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,280
Open to North American residents only.

484
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
I'm sorry.

485
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,660
US and Canada only.

486
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,540
It's an NTSC console, so we can't give it to Europe.

487
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,540
Those are the rules.

488
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,540
Sorry, Europe.

489
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,640
Yeah, and we can't really give it to anybody else because it's going to me.

490
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,520
Unfortunately, cast and crew of the participating affiliate shows are not eligible.

491
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,020
Sorry, Loki.

492
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,720
And last but not least, no copywritten materials permitted in the entry.

493
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,000
Parody is fine.

494
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,240
You can't use, like, if you want to play Welcome to the Jungle, you have to, like, sing it

495
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,400
yourself or something, or, you know, welcome to the radio or something.

496
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
I don't know.

497
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,880
You have to sing a makeup thing.

498
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,680
So there you have it.

499
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,800
ActDeft is asking, what about Mexico?

500
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,280
I will have to ask the official judges about that.

501
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
I think that counts as North America.

502
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,640
I think that's okay, but I will get the final ruling on that shortly.

503
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,360
Decisions of the judges are final, no bitching.

504
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,700
If you like the full list of rules, they are available on forums.allgames.com, and we'll

505
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,400
be posting them on our site soon.

506
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,600
So that's, like, what, like the $500 prize right there?

507
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,920
It's nice stuff.

508
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,140
There's prizes for second and third place, too, but if I told you that tonight, I'd have

509
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,840
nothing to tell you about next week when we plug the contest again.

510
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
So get working on it.

511
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,480
A two-minute commercial parody Orange Laundry, anything that would happen in one of those

512
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,720
little radio bits in the Grand Theft Auto game.

513
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Be creative.

514
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,920
If you want, if you don't have a fancy recording studio set up in your place, you can also

515
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,600
leave it on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, when we're not live.

516
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,480
You can call in and leave a bumper there.

517
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,560
So don't say you don't have many different ways to send this in.

518
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,360
It's all for you, Tali, anyways, because, like I said, and say it again, the console's

519
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
going to me.

520
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
Sorry.

521
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
Even though you're ineligible.

522
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
Even though I'm ineligible.

523
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,800
Hell, I'm not even entering, and it's going to me.

524
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,760
So that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

525
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Good luck with that, Logie.

526
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,600
All right, let's get to some gaming news.

527
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:10,840
All right, so anyways, this week we're going to start things out with a story that's not

528
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,960
too surprising, since there was Marvel versus Capcom.

529
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,560
Sure, let's do Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe, and of course they had a little teaser video.

530
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:27,600
Actually, first there was an image that leaked out showing Sub-Zero staring down Batman,

531
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,380
and then they actually fully veiled it for Midway's Gamer Day, and they were showing

532
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,960
off a trailer featuring Sub-Zero fighting Batman.

533
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,560
And the game itself, it looks, okay, I don't know, not a huge Mortal Kombat fan, but flying

534
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,640
through the air while punching each other, falling, it's kind of hokey, but that's just

535
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,280
my opinion, you know, whatever.

536
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,160
It made me think of the more recent Dead or Alive games.

537
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,400
All I gotta say is, I hope they have villains in there as well, other than just, because

538
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,360
I think it'd be pretty badass if they had a cool version of Joker in there, okay, that

539
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
might be pretty cool.

540
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,640
It might also be in horrible taste, though, to play a fatality on the Joker.

541
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,520
Okay, shut up, okay, fucking Jack Nicklaus is still alive, who cares if, you know, Jack

542
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,560
Nicklaus was a golf player, you mean Jack Nicholson?

543
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,560
Nicholson, whatever.

544
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,600
Hey, you, little did you know, Jack Nicklaus was actually Joker at one time, and then Jack

545
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,920
Nicklaus was, it's just, all these things you don't know about movies, there, Rob.

546
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,520
Look, I said this on Bobby's show when we were doing our little tease before we went

547
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,760
live tonight, the thing is, is that obviously this game's not going to have fatalities because

548
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,160
it's going for a teen rating or whatever, right, but, you know, and people are like,

549
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,800
oh my god, I can't believe it, what's a Mortal Kombat game without fatalities, but like,

550
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,960
you know, it's kind of sacrilegious to be able to perform a fatality on Wonder Woman,

551
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,080
come on, or on Batman, I mean, you can't decapitate Batman, you just can't.

552
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
You can break Batman's back.

553
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,080
You can do a friendship on Batman all you want, in fact, that might be kind of funny.

554
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
You can break his back.

555
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
That would be hilarious, because that's what happened to him.

556
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,080
I think this should be mature, I mean, come on, stop twistying out, DC, seriously.

557
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,280
You could, somebody said in chat earlier, you could kill Superman, but he'd just come

558
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
back.

559
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
Yeah.

560
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:14,560
Because, I don't know, it's just sacrilegious, I don't know, don't ask me why, it's just

561
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,000
something about seeing your childhood hero get decapitated is all kinds of wrong.

562
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,520
Now, here's a question for you, Rob.

563
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
But friendships are okay.

564
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:27,160
Can you think of any game whatsoever that's had Superman in it that's been any good?

565
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,440
Superman on the Atari 2600 when I was five years old was the shit.

566
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,240
Okay, well, that doesn't count.

567
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Why not?

568
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,160
You said name a Superman video game that was good.

569
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Okay, I was thinking, I don't know, within this decade.

570
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,120
There was that Justice League game that was the...

571
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
That wasn't very good.

572
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,400
It was better than the straight Superman games.

573
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,040
All the Superman, all the games that Superman has ever touched, crap.

574
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,280
So I'm sorry, this isn't going to be very good, and it's Superman's fault.

575
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,880
He should have stayed dead like a good superhero.

576
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,840
Instead of a fatality, I'm thinking the game will have nudalities where the characters

577
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,640
are forced to don their own underoos.

578
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,120
I guess that wouldn't get a teen rating, though, would it?

579
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,040
I hope the Wonder Twins are in it.

580
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Well...

581
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
Because they're great.

582
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,080
All I can say is this is going to come out and be yet another mediocre Mortal Kombat

583
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,080
game.

584
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
I...

585
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,800
Am I the only one that actually enjoys Mortal Kombat's combat system, and I like the game...

586
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,360
Like, I kind of liked how you could switch between the fighting styles and the weapons.

587
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,360
If it's in the...

588
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,960
I actually kind of enjoy the Mortal Kombat games, not just for the fatalities.

589
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,960
If I'm to be fair, though, I don't like Street Fighter either, so, you know.

590
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,920
I like the fact that, okay, personally I like the fact that everything was hand-drawn stuff

591
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
in Marvel vs. Capcom.

592
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,640
Hell, if they wanted to do a 2D fighter with the Mortal Kombat characters, all hand-drawn,

593
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,720
in, you know, not really Mortal Kombat style, but kind of ripping off, I don't know, SNK

594
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,360
or, you know, Capcom, that would be pretty badass.

595
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,640
You know, do it, do it, like, DC comic style.

596
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
That'd be pretty cool.

597
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,520
See, I think that they should do a Marvel vs. DC fighter, so that all the Marvel characters

598
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,240
would just beat up everybody in the DC universe.

599
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,160
Yeah, but how much money would that cost to get both those licenses to play together nicely?

600
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,640
But, as I said earlier, they've done it before.

601
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,880
There's been, they've worked together before for plenty of comics, you know.

602
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
Alright, let's read comments from chat room.

603
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,800
SSJ100Matt wants to point out, there was a good Superman arcade game.

604
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,360
Rama says, mind you, Mortal Kombat vs. DC idea has been around since Marvel vs. Capcom,

605
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,840
which is funny because I know it's been brought up on this show before.

606
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,760
I want to say this whole thing was in rumors state a couple months ago, and we joked about

607
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,000
it then.

608
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,640
Rama continues, and as much as I'm not too thrilled about not having fatalities, Mortal

609
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,720
Kombat vs. DC does not need it.

610
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,420
Yes, the fandom will be pissed off, but the DC fandom is bigger than the Mortal Kombat

611
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,840
fandom, and you want to keep the natives happy.

612
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,920
Here's what's going to happen.

613
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,840
This game is going to be, okay, this is in development right now.

614
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,300
It's scheduled out for the fall.

615
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,680
What movie's coming out this summer?

616
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,560
You know, The Dark Knight.

617
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,400
What movie's going to probably be out on DVD in the fall?

618
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,800
Here's where the whoring begins.

619
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,480
They're just going to put this out at the same time as the fucking Dark Knight movie,

620
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,320
and they're just going to try to sell some more copies on a mediocre game.

621
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,960
Pardon my ignorance, I don't follow comic books, but is Iron Man DC or Marvel?

622
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Marvel.

623
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Oh, never mind.

624
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
That's not related.

625
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,080
Because I was going to say there's the Iron Man movie coming out too, but I guess that's

626
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
a whole...

627
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
That's Marvel.

628
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
That's Marvel whoring.

629
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
Ah, that's why I asked.

630
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
And I'm getting the Iron Man game too.

631
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:27,760
Actually, that's Sega whoring Marvel characters, like that and the Incredible Hulk, both games

632
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,560
which look good, but I think are going to be mediocre.

633
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,880
You know, I think the last comic book I bought when I was maybe seven years old was Uncle

634
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,440
Scrooge and Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

635
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,880
I have comics right here.

636
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,520
And you know what?

637
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
What?

638
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Best comic book game ever.

639
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
See?

640
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
DuckTales was a pretty awesome comic book game.

641
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
Comic book.

642
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Comics.

643
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Nice.

644
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
X-Men.

645
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Is that what a comic looks like?

646
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,520
It's a graphic novel.

647
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Nice.

648
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
It's the older one too.

649
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
That's what adults have to read nowadays, because you can't read comics.

650
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,080
You have to read graphic novels.

651
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,360
Hell no, I still buy comics.

652
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,440
I got to ask this.

653
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,320
Instapoll in chat, there is a greater comic book game than DuckTales.

654
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:15,560
Y or N. Meanwhile, we'll see what the Instapoll results are in a minute.

655
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,180
By the way, Tigerclaw wants to add this.

656
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,640
I don't think this is in our show role anywhere, but speaking of Mortal Kombat, I don't know

657
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,000
if you heard this, the actor who was Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat movie, Robin Shu, he

658
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,520
is going to be Jen in the new Street Fighter movie.

659
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,560
So there's that crossover there for Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter that one of the

660
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
actors is going to be.

661
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,960
That's very loose, Rob.

662
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
I know.

663
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,560
A little bit.

664
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:45,520
And little does he realize what kind of crap he is walking into.

665
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,880
Do we not forget Raul Julia and what happened to him in the last Street Fighter movie?

666
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,920
He died after it was made, if I remember right.

667
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Yeah, okay.

668
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Yeah.

669
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,320
Do you really want to admit yourself to something that is associated with death?

670
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,320
I don't know.

671
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
All right.

672
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,200
Let's talk about something associated with eternal life, such as Soul Calibur, because

673
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,520
thinking about this game makes me warm and fuzzy.

674
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,900
And wasn't there like eternal life, soul lives on forever, whatever.

675
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
The soul still burns?

676
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,880
Well, the soul keeps burning on July 29th.

677
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,360
Soul Calibur is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

678
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,800
I'm sorry, not on that day.

679
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,000
Something else will come out that day.

680
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,840
On Xbox Live Arcade though, sometime this summer, Soul Calibur is going to be coming

681
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
out.

682
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,000
It's going to be old school, because it's the Dreamcast version that's actually coming

683
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,320
to Xbox Live Arcade, not the arcade version of Soul Calibur.

684
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,960
It better have the Japanese voices in it.

685
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
That would be kind of cool.

686
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Because my man was maxi.

687
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,600
It will have arcade training and survival modes in it.

688
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,360
And that was revealed at Namco's Gamers' Day.

689
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,920
It is not the arcade version.

690
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,560
It is the Dreamcast version.

691
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:58,800
Now the question is, will it have to squeeze into that 150 megabyte limit or not?

692
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,640
So that's going to be pretty rad.

693
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,640
Especially if they're up the graphics to HD and all that other good stuff they usually

694
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
do.

695
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
That's going to be pretty rad, don't you think, Jamie?

696
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,640
I think that would be fairly pretty.

697
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,160
Soul Calibur is also, remember, they gave us rod caliber.

698
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
That's the next question.

699
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,000
Will we be able to use other interesting control devices on the Xbox 360?

700
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,120
There isn't a fishing rod controller for that.

701
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,560
No, but there's the scenic controller.

702
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
That would be cool.

703
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
We should have a contest.

704
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:34,760
There's also the rock band drums, guitar caliber.

705
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,680
We want guitar caliber, okay.

706
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:43,800
Dude, I played Soul Calibur with my DDR pads because my first DDR I owned was the Dreamcast

707
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,960
DDR.

708
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,960
And the only analog button on there was the Konami logo to put it into SSR.

709
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,680
And the question being asked in our chat room by none other than Bobby Black Wolf.

710
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,800
In other words, will it blend?

711
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,840
That's a very good question.

712
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Will it blend?

713
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
Awesome.

714
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,260
Here's the results of our quick poll and then we'll get to more Soul Calibur news courtesy

715
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,960
of Jamie.

716
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,920
Quick poll was, is there a comic book game better than DuckTales?

717
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
Here are the results.

718
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:17,760
N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, Y, X-Men Mutant Apocalypse.

719
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,920
It's all about maximum carnage, I missed that one.

720
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:28,560
Y, Superman 64, X-Men Arcade is a close second, N, Y, Marvel Superheroes versus Street Fighters,

721
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,600
N, N, DuckTales freaking rocked, Y, X-Men Arcade.

722
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,000
The X-Men Arcade game was really, really good.

723
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,360
Looks like majority do believe DuckTales is the greatest comic book game ever made though.

724
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
That's kind of surprising.

725
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,160
But I can't count DuckTales as a comic book game because the show was out, there wasn't

726
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,740
a DuckTales comic book until I think what, six months after the show had already been

727
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,120
out for a while.

728
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,660
So technically it was based off of, so that question's actually invalid.

729
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,520
So our entire poll was a crock of shit.

730
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:07,560
The entire poll wasn't just a crock of shit, it was a crock of compost.

731
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,000
Well then why don't you take us back to reality Ms. Summers.

732
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,480
Okay but I prefer unreality so how about more Soul Calibur news.

733
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,720
Soul Calibur 4, you know what, I have hopes for this just because I didn't play the last

734
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,080
one because it was, anyway.

735
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,440
So Soul Calibur 4 is going to be out on July 29th and there will be a regular and a premium

736
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
edition.

737
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,400
What you talk about Jamie, Soul Calibur 3 was awesome.

738
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,560
Here you could make, was it the Pope or was it the Pope character they made or was that

739
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,240
in the moral combat?

740
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,360
The Pope was in Soul Calibur 3.

741
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,320
The pantsless Pope.

742
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,600
I had a lot of friends actually make custom characters for that.

743
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,000
That was the only thing I wanted and I don't know if this one's going to have any customize.

744
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,560
The special edition I think was going to have some sort of thing for that.

745
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,320
Well anyway you're going to get your choices of different characters like Darth Vader and

746
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,520
Yoda and a bunch of other people and no spawn.

747
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,800
That's okay though.

748
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,200
But it's of course different versions are going to have different characters like PlayStation

749
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:33,680
3 will have Darth Vader, Xbox 360 will have Yoda, but there are, but like you were saying

750
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:39,240
the premium edition is going to have the extra customization content and a tournament kit

751
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,760
and that will retail for $79.99.

752
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,920
Okay Quandary, I'm getting my stimulus check like we all are hopefully pretty soon right

753
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,120
and I'm thinking $600 perfect amount to finally take the splurge and buy my damn PlayStation

754
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,440
3 right because you know there's going to be all this crap around Christmas time I'm

755
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,360
going to want including home right.

756
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,680
So here's the thing is that here's where I'm stuck is that I don't know whether to get

757
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,000
Soul Calibur 3 for the PlayStation 3 or Xbox because I do think Vader is cooler than Yoda

758
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,320
so I kind of want the PlayStation 3 version based on that alone but I know on Xbox Live

759
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,120
the online is going to have to be better on Xbox Live.

760
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,480
Well yeah.

761
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,120
And there's going to be more people and there's achievements and so on.

762
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
So what do I do?

763
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,600
I know you guys are both buy in your console ownings.

764
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,040
What do you think?

765
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,560
Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3?

766
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm going to put the same question to Chad as another mini quick poll.

767
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,160
Only for those of you guys that own both systems which one are you getting Soul Calibur 3 on

768
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,100
and why if you're buying it or Soul Calibur 4 what the hell Soul Calibur 4 and why?

769
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:45,680
I'm thinking that we'll probably go with the Xbox 360 edition just because Yoda is comical

770
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:53,280
fighting but again it's like you said there's going to be more content out plus I also think

771
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,440
that the Xbox 360 controller is just a little more comfortable for a fighting game.

772
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,440
That's just me.

773
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,800
Loki?

774
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,440
I would just I wouldn't buy a system for that game.

775
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,640
I'm not going to buy the system for the game I want the system for other stuff too but

776
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,080
I'm just saying you know if I'm going to have the system anyway.

777
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,440
I wouldn't buy the system until home comes out trust me I mean because who knows I mean

778
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,000
seriously this summer you know they may be trying to drive sales they may drop the price

779
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
again.

780
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,120
Okay okay okay let me confess I'm eyeing the whole gray metal MGS4 bundle.

781
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,320
Alright good luck finding that.

782
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,000
I would say you know just I guess I could be sort of biased towards the 360 but only

783
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,520
because you should really look at the game more than just one character and I know that

784
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,580
Darth Vader is cool and all but if you want to play Darth Vader kicking ass just buy Force

785
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:49,120
Unleashed when that comes out but I don't know.

786
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,560
Really how much did you well I guess Soul Calibur 2 I mean Link was pretty popular and

787
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
stuff like that.

788
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,040
Yeah exactly like you had to have Soul Calibur 2 on the GameCube because of Link hands down

789
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,880
hands down.

790
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,920
Anyway let's see we had all we actually have all of those all right let's let's let's look

791
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,140
at the chat room what they thought J-Rod says PlayStation 3 equals Vader Vader greater than

792
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:14,400
all Black Wolf says I'm getting the PlayStation 3 yes I have both because of Vader J-Rod says

793
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,040
the only way to get more people on PlayStation Network is to buy the PlayStation 3 J-Rod

794
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:28,040
says Soul Calibur 4 is PlayStation 3 for me let's see hit stun says you have to have Yoda

795
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:35,800
versus Vader Quel Tipo says 360 fuck Vader Semeraw1215 says the PlayStation 3 version

796
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:42,040
is better for Vader and the control is much better for Soul Calibur J-Rod answered the

797
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,480
question like five times it's throwing me off footy monster said if I get it I'm gonna

798
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,120
go 360 because that's what I own plus Yoda greater than Vader yes I said it bitches and

799
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,560
RawsteelUT says stop hating the PlayStation 3 Loki I don't hate the PlayStation 3 it's

800
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,840
just once again they've got the achievement system built in already I have more friends

801
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,200
that are on you know the 360 you know I'll be getting you know exclusive games for the

802
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,920
you know PS3 when those come out just right now if there's a game coming out on both platforms

803
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm gonna get it on the 360 um let's see and sj100 Matt says Rob here's what you do rent

804
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,000
the 360 version and see if you even like it I know I'm gonna like it the Soul Calibur

805
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,520
is like one of the few like hardcore fighting games I really really like who's to say I

806
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,520
know I'm gonna like it Bobby said before who's to say that they could possibly you know add

807
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,060
these as download content later on for the other systems you never know so you know that

808
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,600
could be all for not and of course why would they pass up the opportunity to you know whore

809
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,000
out themselves a little bit and you know sell the characters for an extra five bucks on

810
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,360
top of the game I mean I could see them doing that especially now that we have download

811
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:55,040
content available time will tell time was I would see them not so much the Vader Yoda

812
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,340
thing but maybe bringing back classic Soul Calibur characters who maybe don't make the

813
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,980
cut for Soul Calibur 4 or always were intended to be downloadables or something this should

814
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,820
be a special mode we'll see or what do you want to bet if this custom creator thing is

815
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,260
in it that's where your download content is going to be download new pants but the special

816
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:20,860
mode should be the kill Voldo mode again and again and again oh yes again replace the punching

817
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,140
bag mode with just Voldo yeah all right we'll see all right let's move on new game one thing

818
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,580
you may be able to download content on for Soul Calibur 4 would be the brand new PlayStation

819
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:37,860
store that's right this week after a brief bit of downtime they have finally brought

820
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:43,660
back the PlayStation store with its new features and stuff it's a lot easier to browse and

821
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:48,020
then finally kind of caught up on all the content that you know 360 owners have had

822
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:54,460
for a while including still live for Rock Band and all that stuff so definitely worth

823
00:39:54,460 --> 00:40:02,660
checking out also coming along with that is the brand new firmware 2.30 and that's live

824
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:11,900
as well and I don't know it's supposed to be enhancing I was a DTS HD and master high

825
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:19,660
resolution audio so oh it looks a lot better I didn't really care for the old PlayStation

826
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,940
store too much I still wish that the those prepaid cards are out there because that'd

827
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,820
be pretty nice I could buy some a store credit instead of having actually the pony up real

828
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:37,220
money for you know PlayStation money so you have yet to buy anything from the new store

829
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,900
ah not yet from the new store be honest I haven't plugged in my PlayStation 3 in quite

830
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:48,380
a while what you're not helping to cure cancer even fuck cancer well one thing that I'm

831
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,180
just kind of surprised you haven't jumped out and downloaded although then again it

832
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:57,980
is kind of expensive Gran Turismo 5 prologue it is now on the PSN store it's 1.9 gigabytes

833
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:03,060
to download it 40 bucks if you want to download this by the full game at least you get a case

834
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:10,060
with it and if you stop playing it later on you can sell it for you know money the weird

835
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:15,140
thing is is that the intro video and the ending videos don't come with the game when you download

836
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,180
it but you can download them later to view which is kind of strange you can only get

837
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,560
the ending video of course after you've beaten Gran Turismo there's a whole documentary as

838
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,260
well beyond the apex which is apparently only on the blu-ray version of the game so I guess

839
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,380
you if you want a documentary you have that as well but seriously though that that's the

840
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:38,580
only thing I could see why would they I know why they offered you know these games available

841
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,500
to download but if they're offering a disc version of it I don't understand why people

842
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,300
don't buy the disc version of the game since you know that's the thing you may get tired

843
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,500
playing this game later on or say for example you want to sell it off before you know Gran

844
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,460
Turismo 5 comes out why can't you can't do that with the download version you have to

845
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,260
I can think it I think it may be two reasons one convenience especially for those that

846
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,580
may live in the middle of nowhere where it's harder to get to a store your only option

847
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:10,060
is like Walmart right to no sales tax in some places I don't know if because like I know

848
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,540
on Nintendo if you live in California you know you charge sales tax on we point same

849
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:17,300
thing with Xbox so I don't think on PlayStation which uses real money I don't think you get

850
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,460
charged sales tax which is kind of great so you save a few bucks there but just saying

851
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,300
I'm just saying though wouldn't you rather have a case and all that stuff for I don't

852
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,780
know I just like if a game came out on the Xbox Live Arcade and I had a choice of downloading

853
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,860
there or buying it in a store I'd buy it in a store that's just me I guess what about

854
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,740
the PopCap game well I guess those didn't come out till way later yeah they didn't come

855
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:45,460
out until way later and I mean I don't know RossDielUT is pointing out in chat Rob the

856
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,980
middle of nowhere isn't going to have broadband I guess that's kind of true well yes and no

857
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,540
I think broadband is really spreading out more and more especially as a satellite in

858
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:59,340
some form starting to support like a broadband-esque type of connection and really really middle

859
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:04,140
of nowhere there's always going to be a Walmart around they pop up like I guess it's Starbucks

860
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,380
all right maybe a bad excuse but I don't know just trying to think obviously somebody's

861
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,100
buying it or they wouldn't be putting it out there true well see here I like what they

862
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:17,620
did with Warhawk where they well originally they had it where you can buy the version

863
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:22,300
you know in stores and it came with a Bluetooth headset and that was how they kind of you

864
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,420
know you can do this and get all this extra stuff or if you don't want to buy that you

865
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,580
can just download the version of the game then later on they came out with the version

866
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:37,040
that's just the game only but I don't know it's still I would rather buy it on disk I

867
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,300
guess all right you used to mention you and the husband got this game this week right

868
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,720
grant that he wants a grand theft auto Gran Turismo yeah Dan was playing quite a bit of

869
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:52,180
it he had his cousin over playing it I didn't really watch it because you know me I don't

870
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:58,260
really give a crap was it pretty I said I didn't watch any of it I didn't give a crap

871
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,140
I thought maybe at least glanced at it once or twice I looked a little bit it was pretty

872
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:07,580
all right see that's what I was looking for but did you guys actually go get the box version

873
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:13,780
or did you download it I think that Dan bought it yeah he pranks the discount anyway because

874
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:18,300
the whole game store connection thing yeah probably yeah make sense but he was pretty

875
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,660
happy about it I mean he was like I was like so why do you and I straight out asked him

876
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,460
was like why did you want to pay money for glorify demo and he's like well honestly I

877
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:33,760
look at this as more of a part a you know sort of thing you know that the game comes

878
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:41,060
out this is almost a full game as it is it has a lot of content already he said you know

879
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,500
this is really makes me want the full version more when it comes out and I don't mind having

880
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,700
this to tide me over I was like well put that way I do sort of understand especially he's

881
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,460
so excited about everything that was there so far but he was so mad he tried to go buy

882
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,860
himself a Lancer Evo right off the bat and was seven thousand short don't I was like

883
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:03,220
haha but I mean your man's really into racing games this is seems like every time I go over

884
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,700
there there's something there's burnout or there's something you know there's a lot of

885
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:11,900
times I see racing games on the TV so yeah all right anyhow sorry I just thought I'd

886
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,980
ask because I know you're talking about that before the show but why don't we go into some

887
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:20,580
other gaming news well we do have other gaming news and this is about the PSP apparently

888
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:30,460
the PSP is still hot shit in Japan I don't know why but it is right now in order of systems

889
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:38,100
sold number six is the Xbox 360 PlayStation 2 is after that PlayStation 3 is after that

890
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:45,220
we is after that by quite a bit let me actually just go back and give the give the numbers

891
00:45:45,220 --> 00:46:01,820
so Xbox 360 is at 1147 PlayStation 2 is 6834 PlayStation 3 is 8232 we is 46296 the DS 47158

892
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:10,460
and PSP at 85,721 if that's going to put it into perspective as far as what was sold in

893
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:21,240
the past week so just PSP is really got it now and actually I was looking through a couple

894
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:29,580
of back issues of Famitsu when I was at Kinokuniya and there were plenty of PSP ads just in terms

895
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:37,060
of ads there were just more and you know there's actually a couple of full just PSP only magazines

896
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:41,180
so I thought that was kind of interesting Loki any thoughts on why the PSP is really

897
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:46,460
taking off in Japan all of a sudden Monster Hunter I don't know they like the Monster

898
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:54,260
Hunter maybe Monster Hunter on PS3 that'd be pretty awesome could be okay for one game

899
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,660
I don't know if it's gonna be big in Japan but it's gonna be big everywhere else Grand

900
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:04,340
Theft Auto 4 it's gone gold and is apparently on the way to retail stores for you know one

901
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:09,740
lucky person at Target or Walmart to break street and probably have it out there early

902
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:16,300
like they do every time so keep your eyes out it'll be available soon also for everybody

903

914
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,380
I'm sure they're I'm sure we have I know we have listeners in Vegas I'm sure there's some

915
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,480
out there would be like Loki come over we'll play I'll buy pizza and beer come on but here's

916
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,880
the thing my my boss reminded me he's all you know there's gonna be 360 is there so

917
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,140
you can just bring grant the thought or with you I'm like I know but I want to bring it

918
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:52,060
I don't know if I should bring it on the plane here to be in freaking Las Vegas and you want

919
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,200
to play a video game I'm like I'd be going out gambling going to shows screw video games

920
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:01,460
I don't have that I'm getting there late on Wednesday in the next day is a training thing

921
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:08,580
and then the day after that I'm leaving come back on Friday so and Gerardo mo and chat

922
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:17,260
says an unnamed website presents buying shoes online the game imagine buying shoes anyway

923
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:30,860
oh my god shoes this game rules this game sucks your controllers kind of big I don't

924
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:37,020
think we have anything in your size let's see moving on another series that people are

925
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:44,420
pretty into who likes their survival horror me do you like the game siren okay maybe not

926
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:50,900
well like it or not siren is getting a new translation that's what they call it it's

927
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,940
from from you to magazine it's siren new translation it's a PlayStation 3 remake actually that

928
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:00,780
might you know your magazine yeah I think it was it might actually be in there well

929
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,500
apparently you know if you forgot what the original game was all about it was these souls

930
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:09,580
were trying to get out of a Japanese village and they can only see through the eyes of

931
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:14,980
nearby creatures that's how it works July 24th is the day it's supposed to come out

932
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:20,860
but the demo is supposed to be out very very soon in Japan so if you were a fan of siren

933
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:26,380
and to which J rod and chat says siren is absolutely terrible avoided at all costs and

934
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:31,860
they also have a big likes well siren in the game that sounds just like the one from sound

935
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:38,620
hills well I don't want to say rip off because the game I think was out before so well tippo

936
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,780
says hooray for siren when nothing you do makes much sense you just have to do it anyway

937
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,820
what if they go back and fix all the problems that make the graphics even prettier would

938
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:51,300
that make this game worth owning I don't know hey you know nothing's gonna hurt having another

939
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,840
you know survivor horror game out there there really isn't that many yeah but then you just

940
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,540
have to keep reminding yourself Silent Hill 5 this year Silent Hill 5 this year well you

941
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,980
hope it's this year I hope it better be especially after seeing the little preview clips for

942
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:14,340
it I'm so freaking excited it's boneriffic I don't know if I'd go that far I couldn't

943
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:18,060
find the article that's all right how about some different gaming news then how about

944
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:26,540
some rock band all righty I'll take it well harmonix is gonna have up a downloadable album

945
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:32,620
for a rock band is gonna be available next week and it's called I'm screaming for vengeance

946
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:40,380
by Judas Priest and it has 10 tracks that will cost $15 and it's both for ps3 and Xbox

947
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:48,960
360 and each of the songs will be $2 apiece and then there's going to be a later on coming

948
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,500
in May there'll be an album by the cars and then do little by the Pixies the Pixies are

949
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:59,020
cool so it looks like they're just still working on trying to get those out I think that's

950
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:04,860
a kind of a neat idea and they said that though that they were supposed to have The Who have

951
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:12,340
a first downloadable album but they said that that's going to be later on it's very interesting

952
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:16,540
that they're going this download album route especially in the day and age where you know

953
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:21,020
I don't know this is probably a bit of a controversial statement but where music seems to be getting

954
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:25,340
away from the albums I mean sad but true we live in this iTunes world now where it's very

955
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:29,820
easy to buy the one song that you like and a lot of people don't ever take the time to

956
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:33,580
listen to the entire album so I find it kind of interesting the rock band is kind of going

957
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:38,580
this route where they're standing behind the albums in a way you know but I mean maybe

958
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,620
that's why you know when I read the news I was kind of surprised to see that they were

959
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:46,000
going for what really seems like the classics like it seems like they're going for the classics

960
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:53,100
more than anything right so that was kind of surprising but I guess when you think about

961
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:57,700
well in the classics that's when the albums were really albums maybe it's not so surprising

962
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:03,060
I don't know well you know and I also think that it's sad that we really don't have albums

963
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:11,420
as a big format anymore just because from an artistic point of view keep in mind what

964
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,620
all went into making an album you know with your cover and everything and you had all

the illuminous not realizing they weren't there yet so god I hope I hope you can do

1003

that low level I don't have to level like a hundred to play but I will if I have to

1004
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:22,580

00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:01,340
what this Valkyrie game is here it's it's actually a game that we're getting over here

1012

in the fall it's a turn-based RPG it combines strategy with action and you proceed in the

1013
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:15,960
game like it's a history book no it's not Valkyrie profile is it's from Sega so kind

1014

1015
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:24,860
you've chosen the battles you've thought or the battles you fought the game rewards you

1016

1055
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:47,140
of course on the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 uh well unfortunately the wii doesn't have

1056
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:51,160
the same setup so you might remember when it was announced uh that rock band was coming

1057
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,820
to the wii they were going to have five bonus songs that the xbox 360 and the playstation

1058
01:02:55,820 --> 01:03:01,640
3 didn't have on the disc but they do have as downloadable content as we found out this

1059
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:06,460
week the five bonus songs on the wii are just download songs from the other systems dirty

I actually own two of those five as download songs, and I don't even own that many songs,

1065
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,960
but a little bit disappointing to some that they are just simply download songs from the

1066
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,960
other systems.

1067
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,480

1111
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:44,560
This is my favorite police song ever, ever, and the fair degrees too.

1112
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,200
That was not Message in a Bottle, that was Gibberish.

1113
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,480
That was Gibberish and a ferret.

1114
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:56,240
All right, so we know that Mario Kart is already out now in Japan and Europe.

1115
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,440
Now you would think, of course, Nintendo game, it's gonna be probably the top-selling game

1116
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,360
ever.

1117
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,880
Not really in its first week, actually.

1118
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,820
In Japan, it didn't fare too well.

1119
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:13,840
It ended up being number three, beaten out by Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G, and another

1120
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:23,120
not really a game, but a UMD video, Boku Daki no Kaji-Tsu, and that actually translates

1121
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:31,800
to Only My Fruit, and it's an erotic, like, hentai UMD video or game or something.

1122
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,800
So that's kind of funny.

1123
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,720
Erotic PSP game beats out Mario Kart Wii.

1124
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,200
If only they had more jubilees in Mario Kart Wii, maybe.

1125
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:47,080
Nintendo is sending out an SOS about right now.

1126
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,560
Seriously, how to get beaten by porn.

1127
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,840
I mean, is this like something that's really, really popular in Japan or something, this

1128
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,840
series?

1129
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,840
Yeah, Akihabara.

1130
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,840
Huh.

1131
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,200
Wait, but this is only, also, this is only one store's chart, right?

1132
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,680
This isn't like the whole country's chart.

1133
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,680
No, this is Akihabara.

1134
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,720
All right, so maybe it's a little bit much to say that OMG, Mario Kart Wii gets its butt

1135
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,600
kicked by porn in the entirety of Japan.

1136
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,100
No, it's just one store.

1137
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,920
And maybe this is the only store where you can buy this particular game.

1138
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,240
Sort of like how here, you know, Walmarts and Targets don't carry certain games, right?

1139
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,240
Yeah.

1140
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,240
Maybe.

1141
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,240
If they only carry more porn games, you know.

1142
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,160
Who knows?

1143
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,160
We'll see.

1144
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:31,280
Well, speaking of Wii fun times in Japan, Resident Evil 0 has been given a date for

1145
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,280
Japan.

1146
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,520
Now, of course, this game was already on the GameCube, but, you know, Resident Evil 4 on

1147
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,600
the Wii turned out pretty good, so hell, why not?

1148
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,600
Let's port this over.

1149
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,240
July 10th will be the day that this comes out.

1150
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:45,000
4,190 yen will be the price.

1151
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,640
Now, it's only announced for Japan right now, but, you know, if this sells over in Japan,

1152
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,440
I don't see why they wouldn't bring this over here.

1153
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:56,400
Like I said, Resident Evil 4 Wii didn't do too bad, so why the hell not?

1154
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,400
Excuse me.

1155
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,360
There you have it.

1156
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:07,760
Well, there has been an ESRB game rating released because of blood and fantasy violence, and

1157
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,320
it's set for something on the Nintendo DS.

1158
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,320
Can we guess what that is?

1159
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,320
Huh?

1160
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,360
Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.

1161
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,200
Hey, didn't we talk about this a couple weeks ago?

1162
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,440
Yep, it is for the DS.

1163
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,440
Who would've thought, kid?

1164
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,200
Who would've thought that those secrets slip out and...

1165
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,200
I like fantasy violence.

1166
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,200
Sure enough.

1167
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,820
It sounds kinda dirty.

1168
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:30,480
Don't all the Castlevania games have fantasy violence?

1169
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,720
Don't any game have fantasy violence?

1170
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,360
Any good game has fantasy violence.

1171
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,240
All games have fantasy violence.

1172
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,960
But the best ones have real violence.

1173
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,720
None of them have real violence.

1174
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,680
It's all fantasy.

1175
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:50,600
It's all you perceiving one character beating up another, but it's just fucking data.

1176
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,600
You know what, though?

1177
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,920
WhatTheyPlay.com Snap will have real violence.

1178
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,900
But will it blend?

1179
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,900
We hope.

1180
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,360
I don't know if it'll blend, since it's an idea.

1181
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,760
I don't think you can get ideas into a blender.

1182
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,760
Just yet.

1183
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,880
It'll be a new blender with mind control capabilities.

1184
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,120
You never know.

1185
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,120
I don't know if this'll blend.

1186
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,280
It may blend on the Wii.

1187
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:23,120
But apparently Namco has announced another, yes, there is actually another already, cheerleader

1188
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,600
game for the Wii.

1189
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,260
It's called Wii Cheer.

1190
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:34,040
It features cartoony cheerleaders jumping around and stuff, and you apparently use the

1191
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:38,600
game, each one of your pom-poms, I guess, in the game is actually a Wii remote.

1192
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:45,560
So you use two Wii remotes and kind of think like a Wii version of yet another cheering

1193
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,000
game, Oh and Done, or Elite Beat Agents.

1194
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,200
It's kind of like that, is how you play the game.

1195
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:56,600
I would be interested in this if they had just called it Bring It On, the game.

1196
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,280
And it forces you to use spirit fingers.

1197
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,320
Spirit fingers.

1198
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,720
That movie was...

1199
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,720
Was incredible.

1200
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,720
I don't know.

1201
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,000
That's the only way you're allowed to finish that sentence.

1202
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,580
Don't get me wrong, this is like, I guess, a cool idea for girls, because the video,

1203
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,700
the trailer showed girls playing this game.

1204
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,040
Why's it gotta be an only a girl game, huh?

1205
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,480
Well, because they showed little girls playing the game.

1206
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,440
Do you want to play a game that little girls play?

1207
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,440
Maybe.

1208
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,720
I don't know.

1209
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,160
This is kind of...

1210
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,480
I don't think I could play this game.

1211
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,600
I would feel dirty playing this game.

1212
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,440
Okay I gotta look at some of this trailer.

1213
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:41,400
Aw, little girls dancing and happy.

1214
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,960
This makes horrible radio.

1215
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:50,400
Oh yes, and they butcher the songs, by the way.

1216
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:56,560
So they're probably going to be all horrible cover versions.

1217
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,520
Create your own cheerleader, Jamie, custom mode.

1218
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,520
Look at that.

1219
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,520
You like that, don't you?

1220
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,520
Alright I'll end the...

1221
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,520
I'd probably make a cheerleader...

1222
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,880
I'll end the torture for our chat.

1223
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,760
...killer or something.

1224
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,880
They look like they're all having fun.

1225
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,240
That's what games are all about, right?

1226
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,440
Because they're paid to look like they're having fun.

1227
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,040
What was the game called again?

1228
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,040
We cheer.

1229
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,740
We cheer.

1230
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,120
Just like we ski.

1231
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,120
We cheer.

1232
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,740
We starve ourselves to fit in the outfit.

1233
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,800
They do kind of look like they have starved themselves.

1234
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,800
They're children.

1235
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,800
Be nice.

1236
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,240
They're children on TV.

1237
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:38,280
Then they'll have the, you know, We Need to Get to Dallas, the Debbie Does Dallas sequel

1238
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:43,200
for the game.

1239
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,120
Fireboma says, Sky's sold as soon as he hears that song.

1240
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,200
It is a good song.

1241
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,000
Who doesn't like that song?

1242
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Don't it feel good?

1243
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,040
I actually am really annoyed by that song.

1244
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,680
Well poop on you.

1245
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,120
Sorry Debbie Downer.

1246
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,520
Wah wah.

1247
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,520
Hey Rob.

1248
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,520
What?

1249
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,520
Rob.

1250
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,520
Rob.

1251
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,520
Rob.

1252
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,520
Rob.

1253
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,520
Rob.

1254
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,520
Rob.

1255
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,520
Rob.

1256
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,520
Rob.

1257
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,520
Rob.

1258
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,520
Channel Z says they show a boy playing at the end of the We Cheer video.

1259
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,520
Boys can be cheerleaders.

1260
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,520
Why not?

1261
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,520
Smart boys are cheerleaders.

1262
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,520
You know why?

1263
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,520
Why?

1264
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,520
Because they get to put their hands up the girls' skirts all day long.

1265
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,520
Alright.

1266
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,520
Touche.

1267
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,520
Huh?

1268
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,960
How can you respond to that?

1269
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:26,960
You can't.

1270
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:27,960
Exactly.

1271
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:28,960
Alright.

1272
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:29,960
If you saw Bring It On, you'd know this.

1273
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,880
There was the gay cheerleader who was, you know, cheerleading because he was gay.

1274
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,360
And then there was the cheerleader who was, you know, just there to hit on all the women.

1275
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

1276
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,080
He can hit on all the women, but he ain't gonna get any of them.

1277
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,920
Alright.

1278
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,040
Let's look at another game here.

1279
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,480
It's Okami on the Wii.

1280
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:58,160
And the funny thing about Okami on the Wii is that, well, the box art is kind of screwy.

1281
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,920
And when I say screwy, I mean stolen.

1282
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,920
That's right.

1283
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:07,720
If you look very carefully at the Okami box art, apparently you can zoom in on a portion

1284
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,720
of it.

1285
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:12,080
It's not far from the dog's mouth there, the wolf or whatever you want to call it.

1286
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:18,880
If you zoom in on that, you can see very faintly a watermark that says IGN.

1287
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:26,040
In other words, Capcom lifted the IGN art from the website or whatever to make the Wii

1288
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,440
box art for Okami.

1289
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,440
Isn't that funny?

1290
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,160
They stole their own artwork from a website.

1291
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,360
I think that's really funny.

1292
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,320
I don't know why.

1293
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,480
And apparently it's legit.

1294
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,720
You can go look at a box for this game and it's there.

1295
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:47,560
I don't know if they'll be able to fix it at one point, at some point later, but apparently

1296
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,480
the press releases that have gone out already have this on there.

1297
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,480
People have confirmed it.

1298
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,000
There you have it.

1299
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,840
Frisbee in chat says, Capcom googled their own box art.

1300
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:57,840
Apparently they did.

1301
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,020
There you have it.

1302
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,280
Someone's getting fired.

1303
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,280
Someone totally got fired.

1304
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,280
Ha, ha, ha.

1305
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,280
All right.

1306
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:08,880
We're about ready to take a break here and go from part A to part B, but first it just

1307
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:15,640
would not be an Orange Ons Radio part A if we did not pay tribute to video game classics.

1308
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:19,040
And we do that with a little segment here on the show called our classic video game

1309
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,760
of the week.

1310
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:26,600
Dark Sakura goes through her vast archives of video games and picks out one classic for

1311
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,960
you all to pay respect to.

1312
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,280
What's it going to be this week, Dark Sakura?

1313
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,280
Strider.

1314
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,800
Bitches better recognize.

1315
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,400
And unfortunately the only copy of the first level that I could find was the Genesis version.

1316
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:46,200
However, this was one of the first of their eight meg titles that they bought out.

1317
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,760
Oh, you can't start it past where the music is.

1318
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,760
Wait.

1319
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,760
Don't you start at the very beginning?

1320
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,760
Yeah.

1321
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,760
Yeah.

1322
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,760
Right there.

1323
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,760
This is classic.

1324
01:15:54,760 --> 01:16:04,400
But this is the game that actually in Japan was called Strider Yu Yu and it gave us the

1325
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:11,040
character from Ronald vs. Capcom, but basically it's a platformer and it's actually very

1326
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:18,520
interesting because all of the in-between areas are basically the characters speaking

1327
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,240
their native languages, but they're speaking them to each other and can apparently understand

1328
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,240
everybody else.

1329
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:28,160
I guess they have translators in the future like that, but you go through different levels

1330
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:34,040
and the first one starts off, you have to fight this guy called Grandmaster Mayo and

1331
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,840
you're going through different areas.

1332
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:43,880
You start off in the Soviet Union, the next one is, I think the next level is in Siberia.

1333
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:50,960
There you have the Amazon rainforest, you've got a big platform in space and actually this

1334
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,920
is my favorite level to do because as you're going through that you are on the ground and

1335
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,400
then gravity reverses and you're in other areas and then you have to fight this thing

1336
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,400
that you move in a circle around.

1337
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:06,000
But his weapon is called a cypher, which is like this swinging tonfa style blade, but

1338
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,800
as you get power up he'll extend further and he'll get his little mechanical animal buddies

1339
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:20,560
to help him out, like a falcon and a big saber tooth tiger and his little things that, okay,

1340
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:26,240
I don't think they actually got names until Marvel vs Capcom came out, but the little

1341
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:32,680
tiny things were called Ouroboros, but that was also one of the bosses in the game too.

1342
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:37,920
Okay the stage in this was St. Petersburg, the Siberian wilderness, the aerial battleship,

1343
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:45,080
Amazon, and the third moon, but it was just a really kind of an epic sort of game.

1344
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:53,240
The thing about the in between areas is that, for example, after you fight, there's the

1345
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:58,240
area where you fight three girls with the bosses and one of them is Pompou who was also

1346
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:05,320
one of the helper characters in Marvel vs Capcom, but she speaks Chinese, produced Japanese,

1347
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:13,360
the bounty hunter guy speaks English, I see they didn't do it on the on the Genesis one

1348
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,040
for the arcade one, it had all the places.

1349
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,680
It also, there were other versions that came out, like the one that we were listening to

1350
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:29,000
was the the Genesis one, but it's been on the Amiga, the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore

1351
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:39,320
64, ZX Spectrum, and there's been a Master System version and a Sharp X68000 version.

1352
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:46,840
There was one on, we actually have a burn of this, the version that was going to be

1353
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:58,240
Super Graphics CD, we actually have a copy of the proto for it, but we don't have the

1354
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:03,000
arcade card to play it with.

1355
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:10,200
There's also, I will tell people that there is a Nintendo version, however, just to let

1356
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:16,160
people know is that that was actually based off of the Strider comics that came out in

1357
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:21,600
Japan and is not anything like, it's very interesting because when I, you know, I didn't

1358
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,640
have a Genesis growing up, we only had a Nintendo, but I do remember Strider on the Nintendo

1359
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:30,200
and I love that game, but it is completely different than this game.

1360
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,880
This game is more of like a platformer, where as Strider on the NES was a bit more like

1361
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:34,880
Adventure.

1362
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:41,200
Yeah, it was a bit more Bionic Commando and that triangle jump made me want to kill people,

1363
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:45,320
but I mean, it's so interesting that you have both games that were Strider yet, they were

1364
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,680
so completely freaking different.

1365
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,680
This is very interesting.

1366
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:51,280
Well, part of the reason with this was they were actually going to leave out the, as far

1367
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:56,400
as I'm aware, now this is coming from my husband and for anyone who kept up on older video

1368
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:02,040
game sites, my husband used to run one called Neo Strider Strider Zone and I did all, I,

1369
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:08,360
you know, fixed all of his graphics on it for him, but Dan is like full of Strider trivia,

1370
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:13,800
but he's like, when they were first going to bring it out on Genesis slash Mega Drive,

1371
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,720
that there wasn't enough memory to accommodate the full game, they were going to leave out

1372
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:24,920
the Amazon level and ended up just creating their 8 meg cartridges to, to accommodate

1373
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,920
the entire game.

1374
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,560
And I have to say, it's pretty damn close to arcade perfect.

1375
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,360
It's very, very good.

1376
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:40,160
And for anyone who picked up the, this sequel, there actually was one called Strider Returns,

1377
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:45,360
that was a journey from darkness Strider Returns, but it was really kind of shitty.

1378
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,800
But we had Marvel versus Capcom, like I kept mentioning, and he was in, it was basically

1379
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:56,480
all of his moves for the game, Hideo and Hien, who was in Strider 2, were in the Namco Capcom

1380
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,480
game.

1381
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:02,640
And there was also, the lead programmer of Strider left Capcom and created a game called

1382
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:10,600
Osman, which was also called Canon Dancer, and a lot, it plays basically just like Strider

1383
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,760
is a lot of the same type of game.

1384
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:18,960
It did get a really good sequel called Strider 2, which was really freaking good, but that'll

1385
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:23,000
be touched on at a later date.

1386
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,040
So Strider 2 is different than Strider Returns?

1387
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,040
Or are they the same?

1388
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,040
Yeah, Strider Returns was more of a, it was just awful.

1389
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:36,200
In fact, the story that it brought up was actually retconned because of Strider 2, the

1390
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,360
real Strider 2 that came out.

1391
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:42,400
And the one that came out was, I think, a worthy sequel.

1392
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:48,160
Oh, that's the Amazon level, when you fight the girls that, this is someone doing a speedrun

1393
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:52,440
of the game, they use the emulator cheats though, but it's a speedrun in seven and a

1394
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,440
half minutes.

1395
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,000
He's fighting the half naked Amazon ladies.

1396
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Hot.

1397
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,080
All right, well there you have it, your classic game of the week Strider for the arcade and

1398
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,280
the Genesis or Mega Drive, whatever region you happen to live in.

1399
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,280
Check it out.

1400
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:11,720
Especially, and I would suggest this too, even though technically the Strider NES version

1401
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:15,440
was not the classic game of the week, I would suggest if you've only ever played one, try

1402
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,120
the other and just see how radically different they are for a little bit.

1403
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:24,640
They are, well actually if anyone does want to check out the older one, there was a Game

1404
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:31,600
Boy Advance release called Capcom Classics Mini Mix that had the NES version of Strider,

1405
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,720
Bionic Commando, and Mighty Final Fight, so that's also another way that people can check

1406
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,720
it out.

1407
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,720
All right, very cool.

1408
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,560
And besides that, Mighty Final Fight is just fun too.

1409
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,860
Yeah, it's kind of silly fun.

1410
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:44,200
It's basically chibi final fight.

1411
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,600
At least it had Guy in it, right?

1412
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,600
It did, yeah.

1413
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,600
That's why you need me.

1414
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,600
That's why I have Final Fight Guy.

1415
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,620
All right, we're going to go ahead and take a break here on Orange Laundry Radio, plenty

1416
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,660
more to come in part B tonight.

1417
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:56,880
We're going to talk about some more Grand Theft Auto news.

1418
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,880
Can you believe it?

1419
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:58,880
Lots of stuff.

1420
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,040
Talking about Bionic Commando Rearmed a little bit as well, and somebody dared to say that

1421
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,520
Wii games look like crap.

1422
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,520
Who would have thought?

1423
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,000
We'll talk all about that in part B right after a quick break.

1424
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,560
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1425
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,560
a week.

1426
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:26,520
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
