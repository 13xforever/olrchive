14960	18960	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19680	24400	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast
24400	28920	We now tape live on all games.com every Sunday night. We got a small little crowd
28920	32440	Hello to everybody in our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com
32800	37820	Who are listening to us and our brand new sound quality as well lots of compliments on the sound of the show tonight
38240	42560	We're excited to be here. We got lots more stuff for you in part B more gaming news
42560	45800	We have the mailbag we're giving away a stupid award tonight
45800	52240	And we've got an interview with somebody pretty rad of Farb's the man behind Rom check fail will be talking to him very shortly
52720	54840	but first more gaming news
54840	58400	Yes, loki. Yes, all right anyways
59880	62660	So this is not big surprise because we've been
63400	70520	Seeing sorts of similar bands with other rock star games, but this time brazil has banned bully
71600	78500	Of course you know before the whole banning problem was manhunt 2 now for whatever reason they've deemed it
80200	82200	inappropriate for sale and
82200	89640	The ban has prevented the game from being imported distributed sold or promoted on the websites and stores in the country
90680	93280	apparently Brazilian distributors retailers
94080	98880	will have 30 days to comply with the ban and it came in response to
99680	108160	The requests of the Brazilian youth center it said the aggravating factor is that everything in the game takes place inside a school
108160	109080	and
109080	110200	that's
110200	112200	not acceptable, so
112800	114800	apparently of course take two has
115840	120440	They said it will not have a material impact on the sales of their popular title
122160	124640	Doesn't sound like that. They're going to appeal it, so
125800	129960	You're in brazil and you want to play bully. Oh well guess you're out of luck
129960	135600	You might have to import it or something huh not that I don't think you're missing a whole lot, but you know
135600	141360	Now what's weird to me this game is somewhat old, so are we talking like all the way back to the PlayStation 2 version?
141360	143360	No, this is a scholarship edition
143560	148720	So it's stupid though because the game has been out. I was going to say the game's already been out, so what's the big difference?
148720	151280	It's not like this games like an M rated game or anything
151280	156560	This is like a teen rated game over here, so I don't understand what the big deal is. Oh, it's this school
156560	158960	Oh, that's why oh, I'm sorry
159520	165060	It's a school. Did you actually play they haven't played the game? They didn't see like what contents in the game
165060	169380	They're just oh because it's cool and bullies in tile must be because you're a bully and
170360	175280	So we don't like it. I'd be curious to hear and I know we've got to have some listeners in Brazil
175280	177000	I got because we got listeners from around the world
177000	179000	I'd be kind of curious to hear this from their perspective
179360	183000	And I want to know can you go walk in to you know your big game stores there?
183000	187000	I mean, I don't know if you have the same type of things we do only have 30 days to comply so go quick
187640	193560	I'm curious. Can you walk into a store and buy bully on the PlayStation 2 or have you been able to do that in the past?
193560	195560	That's why I'm kind of curious about so
196240	200280	We'll see. I don't know dark soccer. What do you think about banning video games in countries?
201800	207640	Retarded yeah, I mean is there I I think that banning anything is
211720	218800	Unless we're banning the ferret. No just kidding. I I understand to an extent why people
219480	221620	Why things are illegal you know why?
221620	223500	certain
223500	226220	Things that they think might be harmful to the development of children
226220	230580	But you know I believe that it's not the government's place to decide. It's the parents place to decide I
231900	236260	Guess despite all our I guess despite all our bitching in part a about the way society is right now
236260	239260	I guess we should be thankful where we live in a place where at least we have that decision to make
239460	244000	Where you don't see the country banning things if they'll just give a shit for it. Oh well, yeah
245020	250500	So all right well moving on to other you know I don't know if I'd would call this happy news
250500	253620	I don't think it's really happy for these people that we're working at develop
254380	256380	develop was a gaming company and
256500	263420	Unfortunately they have just lost some projects because the staff was cut from 25 down to just six senior staff
264580	267540	President Michael scandizzo though says I guess he's optimistic
267540	270700	He says if somebody came in tomorrow and said here's a whole bunch of money
270700	275340	Can you get back up and running then by Monday we could be at back up and running it would have to be soon
275340	276900	But if anybody wanted to come in and save us
276900	280640	We'd give the whole kitchen sink to them to them on the extremely cheap
280860	285060	Otherwise after almost 10 years of this group working together. We're going to have to dissolve
285780	289760	Developed was formed in 2003 and it was a bunch of people that used to work for Blizzard
290100	294220	But here's here's the punchline the only game that's come out of develop
294780	296780	Yaris
297500	303260	So if you were hoping for Yaris to I don't know if that's really gonna happen now
303260	309020	I guess I kind of feel bad for these guys though because they were they were probably paid a crap load of money for what?
309020	311980	Couldn't have been a too difficult a game. They might have had all these other projects
311980	315900	We'll never know about that could have been pretty rad and they couldn't get one, right?
317980	322100	But I mean it was Yaris come on Yaris too, then you're probably a masochist
323420	326460	Well, I don't know a juiced in and chat says let them die
326460	333240	I chat that orange songs radio.com if you want to participate can't save them all I guess that's true. Don't worry
333240	335240	EA is hiring right just kidding
336640	338860	Anyway, can I get can I yes, you have some good news
339380	344360	We actually have a video now of a new character for Street Fighter 4
344700	349620	Who is named Rufus and he's actually bigger than e Honda
349620	355580	And he's supposedly really fast for being bigger than e Honda so
357380	359820	Interesting there's also another character called el fuerte
362260	366060	Who is supposed to be just a overall playable character
366060	371980	I don't really see anything though about how the character moves. He's a Mexican wrestler. Hey, that's cool
371980	376820	I like I like the luchadors. He's actually pretty fast. I've watched some gameplay footage of
376820	378260	him
378260	383980	Now Rufus, so that guy is he's pretty fat. He kind of reminds me a lot of oh
384700	389220	God, who is the character that they just added in Tekken 6 the one that was really like Bob?
389500	395420	Yeah, it kind of looks like Bob but with like a ponytail and just like he's got amazing
396820	399880	Gut physics. He looks like Jack Black and nacho libre
399880	407240	DJ janae in chat says king hippo is the king of fat dude characters and games. Yes true statement
407520	409520	Whatever happened to king hippo. Oh
409600	415380	Okay, so I'm looking at this el fuerte. Mm-hmm, and he's actually pretty cool
416960	424120	He fights very much in a from sort of a vega style I'm thinking but it is very
424120	432480	Yeah, dark Tetsuya and Chad it throws back to another Capcom classic says he reminds me of one of the characters in slam masters
432600	436440	Remember Saturday night slam masters. Oh my god. This guy is it was fun
437080	442320	Hideously fast. He actually surmised me. Who was that guy from art of fighting that would throw cookies. Oh
443400	447100	God, I don't remember where the green outfit and suspenders. No, that was a
447100	454300	That was that was Chang that was a fatal fury fatal. Fury was hairy was named Chang. Yeah something something
454300	456300	Yeah, I know you're talking about
456380	462020	Yes, he threw cookies Rufus is kind of like if I kept eating and eating and eating and eating then became a fighter
462340	467540	He he he he has jiggle. He has belly jiggle
468420	470260	Don't you see?
470260	472260	He looks like pom-pom in
472260	478060	A home star runner. All right, a lot lots of diverse characters apparently coming to Street Fighter 4
478060	481700	I'm kind of excited by this. It sounds like there's a lot of people in Street Fighter 4
481700	484660	I mean not only do you have the original fighters and I have some of these new people too
484660	487700	We have the crevice and Viper, you know other people we've heard about in previous shows
487700	492980	So Street Fighter 4 is gonna be a good time. Yeah, I hope now the question but the question is will it blend?
493220	497260	Well, it blends maybe I don't know if Rufus can fit in the blender
497260	502420	Now this is interesting and you know, once again goes to show you that
503420	505900	The Sony platforms are just not
506900	508900	Not that safe against hackers
509500	512220	Apparently though there's been a tool that's been developed
512740	518640	called ps3 proxy and what this program has done is actually allowed people to
518640	526480	Be able to download the PlayStation home beta without actually having to participate in the beta. So they're able to
528280	534720	Modify a few files that they've downloaded from a server to allow them to download the beta even though it's not available to them
535880	540320	Word is right now though that you're unable to actually play the beta
540720	544840	But there has been some video of people that have been able to play the beta
544840	548960	Despite the fact that it was previously thought you couldn't but either way though
549200	552960	The thought is that it's gonna be public pretty soon anyways
553360	557560	So might as well just wait a few weeks, you know for it to come out
557560	562140	But in the meantime though, it's very interesting though that you can download it as it you know
563640	568700	It's not that difficult from what I was reading into I just haven't gone around to actually trying it yet
568700	575140	Where is freaking home already? I mean they've been talking about this for over a year now, you know
575140	577580	And we have yet to really see much more than screenshots
578220	584020	Well, that's it's probably hanging out with spore and I'm sorry, but that's the same do them forever
584020	589700	You know what PlayStation I have you know, and I'm not gonna just dig on place, you know
589700	597060	Sony with this but the PlayStation 3 they've been like touting a lot of features as they say they haven't arrived yet like home
597060	603800	You know, there are new games like hell mill yourself for even going as far as like Final Fantasy 13
604020	607740	Which is not scheduled to be out here for a few years now
608740	613020	It's just like stuff like this. They're like, oh, hey. Yeah, this says it's coming like coming
613020	616000	It's right around the corner, but really it's not right around the corner
616660	620780	You know and even Microsoft's kind of guilty of this too with the whole XNA thing
620780	623660	Yeah, that's cool that they showed us that little snippet around
623660	631180	You know game developers conference in that kind of time, but once it actually coming out not for a while
631740	636340	So that's kind of lame and then you know with Nintendo and the whole WiiWare service
636340	640900	Yeah, they've been teasing that for a long time and I good point. I guess it's not just Sony
640900	646920	It's just easy to pick on Sony for whatever reason. Well, yeah, but at least they've given us a date on WiiWare of sorts
647780	650700	Yeah, I guess I could always put it back. I don't think they will this one
650700	655420	I mean WiiWare is out now in Japan it is out. But what's the kind of release schedule? What are we looking at?
655420	660700	Okay, they release like say eight games or something. How many months do we have to wait for the next games that come out?
660700	663700	I mean, it's not like a typical Nintendo timeframes
663700	668820	Not like live arcade where three months for a B title another three months for a B title in about nine months
668820	670820	You'll get your a-list title
671780	674180	We have a spider in the studio and it's driving me crazy
674180	679900	I need Loki to do something about that or you are you bug phobic step on it kill it
679900	683500	You know what? I hate worse than spiders. What's that? Mosquito Hawks?
684340	687300	That's what we get for having that door open to get some of the cool air in here
688860	694380	Mosquito Hawks that moment of total randomness brought to you by orange lounge radio back to the gaming news
694380	698140	And we are one less spider in the studio. Sorry spider
699380	700540	Sega
700540	704560	things things aren't too good at Sega sadly Sega Racing Studio has
705500	709660	Closed they're gone. They had more than 60 employees at one point
709660	714020	They've really only created one title since they formed in 2005
715020	716100	Sega closed it
716100	719720	There was this comment that Sega gave to next-gen quote
719720	726380	the decision is part of a review of Sega's Western Development Studios to ensure that each studio is profitable entity in its own right and
726700	733460	Unfortunately, the Sega Racing Studios five-year plan would not result in a successful return for the Sega business moving forward
733460	738180	Or you could probably just look at the sales of Sega rally revo because that's the one game they made
738180	740500	and sadly, I I think it was just
741460	748260	Especially in racing. It's so competitive right now with these next-gen systems. There are so many racing games out there right now, right?
748260	752420	I mean look at what they have on you know, these next-gen systems, you know
752420	757860	They got it's just on the Xbox 360. You had games like full auto test drive for za
758820	763700	Burnout I can go on and on for a dirt, you know, just tons and tons of racing games
763780	765780	This is just a very competitive market
765780	772540	So that's that's two studios closed in a week sad both racing games. Mm-hmm
773220	776180	Yaris was a game. Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't really call Yaris
776180	778420	I wouldn't put that quite on the same level as Sega
778540	782820	But it's just kind of like potential you would think potential by the way going back to something
782820	784460	We were bringing up a little bit earlier
784460	790740	I know I'm a little late on this but the Rob D is a fighting game guru and he said the character green guy throws cookies
791020	793020	Chang's Shinzan that was it
793020	799420	Chang's Shinzan. There it is. Couldn't remember the full name. We had a fatal fury special at my school
799420	802160	I never played Chang anyway, it was all about Kim kap won
803300	808420	Actually, I have to agree with you. It was him and my were always the ones I'd use and Yuri's butt attack
809300	811300	She had butt attack and that was great
811380	814540	Any character who attacks with her butt except there is a fighting game
814860	820200	That has a character that fights with her butt and the game kind of sucked and that was the Sailor Moon super s fighting game
820200	824340	So which is which was the first game I've ever imported
825040	831120	It was a Sailor Moon fighting game. Nice. Very nice. So now that we have this little tidbit about me
832440	835600	Going back over as far as the rumor mill is concerned
837240	840040	There has been rumored a a
841520	842600	New
842600	844840	Ace attorney game to be coming out
844840	851520	Um that has been called um, Gakuten Saiban perfect prosecutor and it should be starring
852280	853600	Edgeworth
853600	854840	objection
854840	856840	overruled
857640	860480	Well, you said it was a rumor so I thought I would object but I
861520	866520	You know these people that love the ace attorney series love the ace attorney series
866520	870040	I have a friend who is sucked into the series. There's like manga and everything
870040	875820	Yeah, um, but um, they're actually the it came across from some scans in Famitsu
877000	882520	So, um, you're you remember Shane used to come on this program a bit a long time ago. I don't remember mr.
882520	888120	High musical I'm reminding the listeners right me glattov so and so on who used to work in on mr. High school music
888120	892760	Okay, he played he plays World of Warcraft with us, right and he joins ventrilo the chatting
892760	897040	You know how like in ventrilo whenever it joins you have that little robotic voice that says, you know
897040	902680	Rob has joined the server you can put in whatever you know name you want his thing whenever he joins the server goes
902800	905200	Apollo justice is sexy has connected
906960	911640	Just cracks me up, but I'm telling you people that are really into Apollo justice are really into it
911720	918100	Hey something a lot of us are into this week is rom check fail a couple weeks ago a little independent game called a rom
918100	924680	Check fail swept gaming blogs everywhere rom check fail takes several classic video games such as Super Mario Brothers
924680	930520	Asteroids pac-man throws them all into a blender basically resulting in unique and nostalgic
931000	934840	Gameplay basically kind of what you do in this game. Is that one minute you might be
935600	940000	Zelda in a Mario level and you're trying to stab the asteroids with your sword
940000	943680	It would be link, but then the next minute well, you know what I mean, but then the next minute you are
944480	948280	You're you're in the asteroids level and then suddenly you're pac-man
948280	952520	You have to find the dot on the screen to eat the things from kicks are flying around the screen
952520	956420	But when you find it they turn into blue ghosts. It's excellent. I love it
956720	961200	The man behind rom check fail is Farb's and we got in touch with him this week
961200	966760	And we're excited to have him on the show tonight, so let's go to the phones all the way to Australia
967800	972280	Where Farb's is from let's get him on the line all right. Hello Farb's are you there?
973120	975620	Hi, yeah, hey, how you doing Farb's?
975620	978620	I'm not bad not bad all right
979760	983260	So you're the guy that wrote rom check fail was this is was it a solo effort
983260	985620	Did you do this all yourself or how did this happen?
986660	988740	Yeah, yeah, no usually I work alone um
989420	995340	It's just easier that way coordinating the project between multiple people way too hard especially when you want to do something a bit silly
995620	997900	How long did it take you to do the whole thing?
998580	1003620	Well, I'm not sure if you saw but it was part of the video game named generator contest over
1003620	1008060	So so the whole thing had to be completed in three weeks, which is why it's it's pretty small game
1008060	1012180	But you know that's why wow it's very impressive considering. It was done in three weeks
1012180	1016540	I I had heard it was it was like the the winner didn't you end up winning that competition too? I?
1017420	1022660	Did I did so well congratulations? Well well deserved how did it get from?
1023300	1029900	Competition rules to this finished product like whether where there are certain rules that made you want to go in this direction of developing
1029900	1031900	This game or what happened I?
1031900	1038460	Think you tapped into a little bit of controversy there because the the contest had one rule that you had to use this video game
1038460	1039660	named generator
1039660	1045580	Websites come up with a name for your game, and then make that and that's something I didn't actually do so
1046420	1049260	What happened you get a really bad name out of it or something?
1049900	1055980	No, I know what happened was I am I kind of started in that direction, so I started sort of looking at the generator
1056860	1061820	Running it a couple times coming up with different names having to think about how it works and thinking about ways that I could
1061820	1067380	Hook in an exciting game with that right and what I saw pretty quickly was that the generator was
1068060	1071220	It was coming up with a couple of different concepts and just kind of mashing them together
1071820	1075380	Which if you played ROM check file you'll see is certainly a part of ROM check file
1075740	1078020	So anyway, I saw that and I thought hey
1078020	1083460	You know what would be awesome is a game that actually generates lots of the games that come out of the generator
1084340	1086340	so you know
1086420	1089540	That's pretty funny. It's kind of it's telling you through all these games
1089540	1093220	It's like you throw all these games in a blender and out comes this so it
1093620	1099620	Wasn't necessarily that you had the idea to begin with the the blending of the names kind of inspired the blended game idea
1099660	1103460	Yeah, totally so I was going to do stuff that actually came out of the generator
1103460	1107500	But I realized possibly also with the help of some advice from a friend that
1108420	1114540	When somebody sees an emu on the screen and and there's a dragonfly, but I don't know what that means right whereas
1114540	1117980	If they see Mario, and they see some space invaders. They totally get that immediately
1117980	1121500	Well, I don't know the first time I played ROM check fail. It took me a minute to get it
1123340	1128580	But but just imagine how much would have been if you didn't actually know what the characters were all the ways that they
1128820	1130820	interacted with each other so
1131540	1134220	Not only was it kind of tapping into the whole nostalgia vibe
1134220	1138700	But it but it also communicated to the player much more quickly what the hell was going on
1139020	1143980	I guess that's a very good point because you know eventually kind of figure out okay if I'm pac-man right now
1143980	1149660	I better eat this dot before I try to touch something or I'm gonna be in trouble. So yeah, do you think that's right?
1149660	1154140	Whereas if you were a penguin and you had to go pick up a water lily before you could eat things you
1154220	1156220	You would never think of that
1157180	1159980	Unless I was playing the penguin and water lily game. I don't know
1160940	1162060	Maybe it would be in the title
1162060	1167580	Do you think it's that nostalgia is the part of the reason why this game is just kind of like spread like wildfire amongst all
1167580	1172620	The gaming blogs and the internet and kind of like caught on I think that has helped a lot. Yeah, um
1172620	1177260	Which is a shame because that's not really what the game was meant to be about but you know, I'll take it
1177820	1181900	What what is the game meant to be about? Well, whenever I make a game, I usually think about it
1182460	1186220	Just starting with a gameplay concept first. So I think about the way that the game's gonna play
1186220	1189660	I don't really think too much about what it looks like or the narrative or anything like that
1190300	1192620	And this game like I was saying was about
1193340	1195340	matching different kind of
1195900	1200300	Archetypal characters together just kind of throwing them in a scene saying deal with it
1200300	1205740	Um, what was the question again? No, that's okay. Um, what like
1206780	1212560	Um, I guess we were talking about the that is spreading along the blogs and it's kind of like wildfire and the nostalgia
1212940	1219100	Is the nostalgia part of you know, why this game you think is caught on so so popular?
1219900	1223740	Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, I think I think that's half of it. Um
1224620	1228220	Because I mean you look around you you're gonna find a lot of games that that are
1228220	1233660	You're gonna find a lot of games that that take mario sprites and chuck them in a game or or that kind of thing
1234140	1237580	Um, so it's not not unique in in the first thing
1237820	1242460	What's largely unique is the way that it uses them and the fact that there is a playable game underneath
1243400	1249020	Absolutely. Did you have to recreate all of the the the mario and I I don't know if this might be a controversial thing
1249020	1250940	I'm asking so you can feel free to say no comment
1250940	1256380	But did you have to recreate all those sprites and the music and everything or did you were you able to kind of?
1256380	1259420	I don't know. I guess borrow from the games that were already out there
1259420	1261820	How much of this did you have to kind of build from scratch?
1262860	1264380	uh, well
1264380	1269820	Strangely enough this actually took most of my time like recreating the the gameplay interactions and things
1270140	1273020	was very quick when I was just using a bunch of squares, but
1274060	1278140	Once I started looking at the the proper sprites from all the games and the sounds and everything
1278220	1280220	It was a huge process to um
1281180	1284860	To pull it all together and it came from whatever source I could find first to be honest
1284860	1289340	So there's there's a lot of sprite rip pages that I used. So thanks to everybody who put those together
1289900	1295180	Um, all the music came from different people's websites where they they've sort of re-orchestrated tunes
1295180	1298780	Which I then tweaked a little bit to make them sound a little bit more like each other
1299340	1301260	And cut them up and pasted them together. So it was
1301900	1306940	I like to think of it as a collaborative effort from the entire internet retro gaming community
1307020	1311340	I was gonna say i'm thinking this isn't my name's on the credits. This isn't just like a hodgepodge of a game
1311340	1315580	It's also kind of a mixture of all these different contributions that are already out there on the internet
1315820	1319660	So some guy who ripped zelda sprites might have helped with this game and didn't even know it
1320220	1324060	Um, yep. Yep, since this game's kind of spread all around the internet, you know
1324140	1329340	You gotta love the way the internet kind of reacts to things and i'm sure your email box has been starting to get some
1329420	1334140	Emails about rom check fail if you've gotten any kind of like crazy feedback about the game or what's like the craziest thing
1334140	1336140	You've gotten in response to the game
1336940	1341100	Uh, actually I haven't really got much back from it, which is which is a bit surprising
1341100	1344380	Um, I think a lot of people play the game through a direct link
1344380	1349660	So they don't even see my website and people who do even like pick it up by going through my website
1349660	1355260	Don't don't think to email me. So it's been a bit quiet. I mean the the tig source feedback threads have been great
1355900	1357420	um
1357420	1361260	But unless i've explicitly asked people to talk about my game it's usually been a bit quiet
1361740	1364220	Well, that's a damn shame. We need to get some of our listeners to send
1364860	1369420	Love for making this game for free as part of a competition. So listeners send farb's little love
1369420	1371900	Where's the website they can get in touch with you? Oh, uh,
1372440	1375820	www.farb's.org f a r b s excellent
1375820	1379340	Do you have any uh future projects you can talk about things that might be coming to the website soon?
1379340	1381340	Because you have some other games already on the website, too
1381340	1383740	This isn't the only thing you've ever done you have some other games as well
1384220	1388620	But um, do you have anything in the future? You might want to give us some hints about uh
1390540	1393580	I would love to but unfortunately i'm still deciding what i'm gonna do next
1393580	1400540	I mean i've got i've always got about a dozen ideas kind of floating around bumping into each other and it usually takes
1400860	1407660	Something to actually push me to put something together as a game. So the uh, the vgng compo was great for me because I I had
1408380	1411260	You know some concept about games that I wanted to make
1411660	1415100	Suddenly I had a three-week deadline to actually do something and so I got something done
1415500	1418780	Whereas now i'm back in that phase of sort of thinking. Oh, I don't know what I want to do next
1418860	1421260	So there will be games coming I can promise you that
1421260	1425420	But I have no idea which ones excellent. Well here, you know something we at orange launch radio
1425420	1427580	Have been talking about our dream game for a long time, you know
1427580	1431820	I'll just kind of throw it out there if you can make a game with cats wielding lasers at each other
1432300	1435820	Might be an amazing game. So just give me something to think about maybe for the sequel
1437260	1441180	Now something we always ask all of our guests that come on the program because you know, we're all gamers
1441500	1443660	What kind of video games have you been playing this week?
1443740	1448460	Have you been playing independent games you a console gamer pc gamer? What kind of games you've been playing this week?
1448460	1451100	Uh, this week's been very quiet for me. I've uh,
1451900	1455740	I've been a bit busy. So I haven't haven't been able to get into any massive titles. So
1456300	1460780	Mostly for me it's been just sort of picking up indie titles because usually you can kind of pick them up have a bit of
1460780	1463420	A play and then and then put them down again because they're not very large
1464220	1469100	Um other than that bit of smash brothers friend of mine imported it so we were actually able to play it which is nice
1469740	1473820	Awesome, nothing big very cool. Do you find yourself drawn to other indie games?
1473820	1475980	Do you like to kind of sample what else is out there in the indie world?
1475980	1481500	Yeah, I like to but but like I said, I mean i'm interested in gameplay mechanics and you're going to see a lot more variation
1481500	1483980	in that kind of stuff in indie games, but
1484860	1485900	also
1485900	1489820	They're they're small and disposable and that that's really great when you've you know, got 10 minutes free
1490140	1494620	Uh, it's a lot better than thinking. Oh i've got 10 minutes free. I'm going to start morrowind that that doesn't add up
1496140	1500780	Exactly, um, I got one more question for you and this might be opening a big can of worms
1500780	1503900	But it's something we've been kind of talking about a little bit in the past on this program
1503900	1509100	And that would be kind of the future of uh console, you know gaming as we see these more
1510060	1515900	Independent scene friendly things start to open up such as xna and we wear and things like that
1516220	1520620	From your viewpoint as somebody who's been kind of developing independent games. What do you do? Do you think that?
1521260	1526940	Xna and the these things that are going to make uh console development a little more accessible to the indie developer
1526940	1531420	Do you think this is going to be the next big thing in gaming? Do you think this is going to take off or do you think?
1531420	1535500	Yeah, this pc is always where it's really going to be at
1537020	1542060	Well, I think uh the the the xna thing that they're coming up with where pretty much any game can get
1542620	1549260	Distributed is is definitely going to be interesting. Um, but in that sense, I think it's just going to really look a lot more like pc
1550220	1557260	I don't think we're ever going to really hit that that kind of wonderland that all all indie game developers
1557260	1562860	Hope will one day open up where you know, you can make a game in three months by yourself
1562860	1568300	And push it out on a console and suddenly make millions and millions of dollars. I mean those those opportunities pop up occasionally
1568860	1570860	But they're extremely rare. So
1572300	1576220	I don't know. I I think it'll open up a bit more. I think it'll become a little bit more like pc
1576300	1578300	But I don't think we'll see any major changes
1579500	1584780	All right. Well farbs. Thanks so much for joining us all the way from australia tonight. We really appreciate it farbs
1584780	1587740	He is the man that wrote rom check fail it check him out
1588380	1595820	Www.farbz.org and you can download other games as well. Not just rom check fails. So check that out
1596220	1598220	Farbz, thanks so much for being with us tonight
1599260	1601260	All right. Cheers. All right. Take care
1602460	1607260	I I want to listen to him talk some more. That was really cool. Sorry. He's gone now
1607260	1613660	So yeah, but yeah, it's something about accents aren't isn't there but I I want I want I want laser capture
1613660	1616860	And and he's quite talented. I mean rom check. I was very surprised
1616860	1620860	I mean, I kind of knew going into that interview that rom check fail was done by pretty much one guy
1620860	1625740	But that's still very impressive, you know, i'm always impressed by some of the levels of talent out there
1625740	1630300	Well, best of luck to farbz and thanks for taking the kind of time to come on the show. We appreciate it
1630380	1634540	Are you a big fan of rom check fail loki? I think you were the one that showed that to me first played it a bit
1634780	1638460	Yeah, I don't know. It's one of those games that you can play for just a little bit and then
1639100	1641500	Leave it for a while. It's like the game that made me go
1641500	1645500	What is that music and then I realized it was marble madness. It's like it's like
1645740	1650380	WarioWare type of thing like as long as you could just play for like a little bit and it's like total crack and fun
1650380	1655820	You're like, okay. It's like it's a good like micro game like the c1 that it was just all like nintendo stuff like, you know
1655820	1657980	mega man with mario's all the
1658540	1663500	Well, he might hit copyright issues with that. I mean, well, I guess he already is. Yeah, who cares? That's true
1663500	1668140	Okay, make something for we wear or something. That's why you need to do it like all underground, you know
1668140	1672060	And don't say who you are and just throw it out there on like, you know, the bit torrent
1672060	1676620	Well, I would gather farb's is probably not his real name. Well, I'm just saying speculation
1676620	1680940	I'm just saying though instead of like having a website and stuff because if you do it all underground and stuff like that
1681580	1686940	They can't really stop yet. I mean, especially if you just kind of throw it out there, you know, just let it catch the current
1687340	1690380	All right. Well, we want to thank farms again for taking the time to come on the show
1691020	1697020	All the time away from developing new games for us more crack for us later on. All right, let's get back to the show
1697020	1702940	Later on. All right. Let's get back into the gaming news. Loki take it away. All right. So here's another rumor that's coming around
1703020	1704860	That's not a big surprise
1704860	1710140	But um, i'm interested in to see that they're actually kind of going this route or maybe thinking going this route
1710620	1718220	Um rumor is that microsoft course is good looking into creating a wiimote like device for the xbox
1718600	1719500	360
1719500	1722860	Uh, the motion controller is going to be codenamed newton
1723580	1725260	and uh
1725260	1727900	No word on what exactly this might be
1728300	1729580	Uh something though
1729580	1736700	it will use a like a usb powered sensor bar and it will possibly have rumble motors as well as um,
1737820	1741660	a microphone built in for voice activated games, so
1742700	1747740	It's interesting that they might be going this route and the same way I kind of think you know
1747820	1752940	It's not a little copy cat-ish a little bit, but everybody kind of copies everybody at some point. So
1752940	1754940	And I know microsoft has had
1755100	1760380	Not great success trying to tap that family market and stuff that nintendo has but
1761180	1763020	Well seen it hasn't done bad for them
1763260	1767980	I mean, you know, even though amongst the hardcore we kind of all turn our noses at it and go it's kind of dumb
1768220	1771260	But apparently it's been doing fairly well for them. So who knows?
1772460	1776860	I don't think as well as like say we sports or something like that. No, I don't think well
1776860	1779180	I don't you just never know with microsoft
1779180	1784700	I know with microsoft microsoft kind of has a way of taking it at somebody else's idea and kicking it up a notch
1784700	1789020	You know what? I mean, but can you imagine though just if you will like motion controlled games with
1789960	1795180	360s graphics. Yeah, I mean that'd be fucking awesome. I don't know. Uh, what do you think dark sakura? Do you think uh,
1795740	1799980	Do you think it could be successful motion control on the 360 or and I open this up to chat, too
1800220	1801180	What do you guys think of it?
1801180	1804700	Do you think it could be successful in the 360 or is it gonna feel like a cheap knockoff of wii?
1805660	1807900	I really don't think it would be that difficult to integrate
1807900	1814460	Into um, the 360 because really all you need is just the uh, the input device, you know
1814780	1817100	The the thing you need your sensor bar, of course
1819660	1823340	Oh there went my power plug again, um, I don't think that it's it's going to
1824860	1826780	I really don't think that it's going to be
1827820	1831820	That sort of cheap knockoff thing, but I think people are going to have a preconceived notion
1832460	1836620	About how it's supposed to work because they have this experience with the wii
1836620	1838940	You know, I think it's really all about the games
1839180	1842140	It really is, you know, depending on what they release with it
1842140	1847660	And if they've been paying any attention to the wii they're going to take something like wii sports or carnival games and really kick it
1847660	1852460	Up a notch and uh, it might do very well. This is a chance to either sink or bail with it
1852460	1859260	I mean, I mean sink or swim with it. I mean and if they swim they'll be you know, because Microsoft they'll be walking on water
1859980	1861980	Comments from chat room chat.orangelaundry.com
1861980	1867100	RawstealUT is predicting that newton much like xbox live vision will have incredibly limited use
1867660	1872780	That is the problem. I mean at least nintendo built their whole console around the concept so, you know, the game's integrated
1873420	1877100	VxjasonXV our fearless webmaster says Microsoft wants to tap that
1878220	1885420	Gerardimo says I want motion control res. Oh or space channel 5 does come to xbox live arcade do want motion control
1885420	1892940	Choo, choo, you never know it'll be interesting. So I just you said that I was already starting to think of samba
1892940	1896460	D'amigo the one we with the posing well, they are doing that
1896460	1900060	I know that's what I started thinking of doing your bizarro little poses
1900060	1903740	Uh juiceton says imagine a game that requires the camera and the motion controller
1904780	1910220	Good idea, but imagine the highly limited audience that's going to reach unless xbox then puts out a you know
1910220	1915580	Another bundle that comes with both which I guess is is very possible. I don't know
1916540	1918540	Who knows?
1918540	1925500	So, uh, we'll continue on with the gaming news and I want to talk about metal gear solid online, you know over here
1925500	1930140	Uh, you had to pre-order the game in order to get the metal gear online demo, but guess what?
1930700	1937260	In the european playstation store metal gear online premiere beta free download on the playstation store
1937260	1940380	April 17th to may 6th in europe
1940380	1945500	So if you live in europe, you don't even have to pre-order although I imagine you know logic
1945500	1948860	You know, usually this is the type of thing that would make us go woohoo free things are awesome
1948860	1952220	But then again, I go I imagine most metal gear fans
1952860	1958300	Probably pre-ordered the game anyway, so I can't imagine there's that many people but at the same time
1958300	1960300	There might be some casual fans like for instance
1961020	1964140	You know if if this were happening in the us I go
1964140	1968620	Hmm free beta i'll download it and check it out. I may not be into metal gear that much but hey if it's free
1968620	1970620	That gives me incentive to take a look
1970620	1976860	Right rob what imagine technical, um, uh, the imagine babies. No
1976860	1979100	Imagine not stumbling over your words imagine
1979740	1982940	Uh tactical espionage action sounds like fun though
1984140	1985580	babies
1985580	1987580	babies with babies
1987580	1991020	Yes a tactical espionage baby game metal gear bailey
1991020	1995500	A tactical espionage baby game metal gear bailey metal gear babies
1995980	1999020	Maybe that'll be you know, because they have the flash forward in metal gear 4
1999020	2004700	Maybe that'll be a metal gear 5 flash backwards. By the way, the beta is running from april 21st to may 6th
2005660	2010460	Uh, which by the way happens to be one day less than we have it in north america. Hmm
2012060	2014060	Something is afoot maybe all the uh
2014620	2019340	Maybe all the european fandom over the years for sony is paying off. Who knows anyhow?
2019340	2026060	Your fandom pays off every week when you send us emails to our address mailbag at orange laundry.com
2026060	2031740	We love getting your emails and uh, just yes, we do dark sakura. Just say it. Yes, we do
2033980	2036380	Even though we've moved over to all games.com now
2036380	2040700	We move the mailbag with us and it's still the same email address mailbag at orange laundry.com
2040860	2045660	Let's open up the mailbag and check out some of the email that came in since last week's show dark. Sakura
2045660	2051420	Dive in head first. Will you into the mailbag and pull out some of your favorites? No, because there might be an anvil in there or something
2051980	2054460	Or a spider. Oh, okay. So
2055660	2057660	um first, um
2058300	2060780	Email of the evening is from trisha licious
2062380	2067900	That's a cool name trisha licious. I hate to say it. Oh, i'm gonna i'm gonna make us lose a fan
2068140	2070140	But it does sound like a stripper name
2070140	2077980	Dear olr, just picture the guns and roses in the background now taking the stage trisha licious on my ipod
2078460	2080860	I thought I would ask you about a recent game
2080940	2087100	I purchased and I had to buy it from an online retailer after reading a review in game informer magazine about pinball hall of fame
2087100	2092060	The williams collection which received a high rating and for only being 30 bucks. I knew I had to have it
2092460	2096380	I proceeded to my local gaming shop expecting them to have the game since it was
2096380	2100300	Reviewed in their magazine, but nothing was on the shelf or listed in their computer database
2100700	2105180	When I finally got the game after buying it online, I lo- I loaded it up and started playing
2105740	2110540	Phf on my wii is the best pinball I have played on a pc or console
2110940	2115280	I wanted to try to get the word out that this game really kicks major butt as a pinball simulator
2115980	2120780	I love it and I want to make sure those all those who also love pinball to give it a try
2121260	2125500	Now I want to go play these tables all over again if I can find them at a local arcade
2125500	2128240	The local arcade love to you all huggies trishalicious
2130460	2132460	Pinball is awesome
2132460	2138860	Pinball is the best ever, you know, I downloaded a new table for pinball fx on xbox live this week the uh, buccaneer table
2139020	2142140	Yeah, uh, but I didn't get a chance to play because I was down with that rocky and bullwinkle table
2142140	2145340	but I got sidetracked my whole fantasy star universe thing, but I
2146380	2149100	Trishalish is not the first person to point out that that's a fun game
2149100	2155260	But I bet you especially would enjoy that you pinball whore really? Yes. Good times. Yes. All right
2156220	2162060	How can they release a pinball collection a williams pinball collection and us not have it just just just checking?
2162620	2164620	Okay, then. I'm
2167020	2172220	What I was shaking my head anyway next email is
2172220	2178000	Is kamatari's forever is who that is
2178000	2182400	Hey, olr. Love your show been listening for about a month and one and wondering a few things
2182720	2185360	Is the ferret still there from your transition to all games?
2187280	2189120	That answer your question
2189120	2191600	That would make me sad if it were shipped away into a box
2192480	2197280	I've also heard rumors that konami will make a ddr 10th anniversary game sometime around this or next year
2197600	2201040	Could that be plausible due to licensing fees and whatnot? Just want to know
2201040	2206640	I could see it being plausible since they're probably running out of ideas for new ddr games anyways
2207640	2214360	Yeah, there's not like too much they can do to revise. So let's put a new ddr game with all the classic konami songs
2215400	2217480	Wait, that's like every other ddr game
2217600	2223080	What I think that they should do if they did like an anniversary edition is to have you be able to choose your mode
2223080	2226440	That you play in so you can actually load up
2226440	2232620	the very first ddr and have to do your little jumps around for your codes and shit and have it all be
2233620	2241400	Unvivid and you know instead have like second mix mode where you have dance battle pop-up because you know dance battle was the best thing
2241400	2243400	about about second mix and
2243900	2250820	You know, you should do stuff like that like a third mix have paint mode or something, you know stuff like an SSR
2252180	2253420	Whoops
2253420	2255420	Or you can dance to this song
2255420	2257420	What a hoe down? Anyway
2257420	2259420	Hope that's what I get for leaving things running
2259420	2261420	Can I be, do you have something to say about
2262060	2266220	It would not be a first show on all games if I didn't screw up somehow. So there you have it
2266220	2267720	Do you have something to say about the ditter?
2267720	2273140	Look, I've been saying forever if ddr wants to evolve the game needs to be they need to scrap all their old code
2273540	2275540	Rebuild the game from the ground up
2276660	2278880	Honestly make it look like guitar hero at this point
2278880	2282380	I think that's the best way to make a catch on here in the US. I hate to say it
2282380	2286780	How about okay? How about this? You just totally ignore like all the like tutorials and
2287300	2292020	Get rid of quest mode for the love of God quest mode is
2292540	2296700	Crap or redo quest I think quest mode has potential to be good
2296700	2301780	No, no, but not in its current form quest mode is crap what they need to have bring challenge mode back
2301780	2304700	That's fine. The challenge modes. I think are a lot more fun
2305500	2306740	or
2306740	2310020	Challenging than quest mode quest mode is like okay play allows on go. Oh
2310020	2312020	Oh fun
2312140	2318060	Nothing like repetition. I just think if they want the DER to continue they should you know remit
2318060	2321980	I've said it for years. They need to make DDR take it from being cooperative and making competitive
2322260	2328980	But that's just me or have like new modifiers that are song specific that like certain things happen in the song
2328980	2334320	Maybe integrated with like, you know videos or something that are playing like the arrows fall down different ways or something like that
2334700	2336700	I mean, which would be pretty cool like different
2337380	2338780	themes
2338780	2342340	All right, next email next email is
2343700	2345700	As soon as it loads up
2346820	2349140	Next email comes to us from Harvey. Oh
2350460	2354900	Sorry, it comes just from a poorly formatted email. Um, I'm
2355900	2360040	Okay, I'm just gonna say Harvey was the last name because they put their full name in there. So that's what I'm gonna say
2360040	2365220	Um, hey, what's up, Ol R. I was wondering what do you think about Sony saying DualShock?
2365220	2369740	Wouldn't fit in a 6-axis controller and now it's there. How ironic
2370180	2372620	they didn't ever say it wouldn't fit just they
2373100	2377040	Couldn't do it at the same time with the tilt and it's so last
2377040	2382420	Yeah, I mean and it's actually the same shell. In fact, there's actually spots for the two rumble motors. So
2383340	2390540	That's bullshit. Do you think that redesigning the PSN store will affect the amount of content that is bought?
2390540	2397260	Will you guys be buying any games from the new we wear section next month? Also do like 365 give dark soccer a cookie. I
2398180	2401100	Will make it one of my goals as a gamer to give her a cookie
2403100	2406220	Dude cookies are great, but you have to get it to me by next weekend
2406940	2410540	Because it's your birthday. It's my birthday. That's right. I mean, whatever I want to
2411660	2413660	cookies and booze
2413940	2416660	Life is five did not give you a cookie. In fact, they gave me a migraine
2416660	2418660	Uh
2419300	2421300	Yeah, I
2421460	2426820	Want to they owe me a cookie and then they owe Rob money as far as we wear. Yes
2426820	2430540	I'm hoping there's some movies or something gameplay videos that make its way to the US sites
2430540	2432540	I can learn a little more about these games
2432820	2437380	Than just having to take a leap of faith. You know, I mean that game just like well, yeah
2437380	2441820	Okay, maybe there's certain cases where I would take a leap of faith and like I already know I want that. Dr
2441820	2446500	Mario game especially it has like the online and everything but you know some of those old ones like even like Final Fantasy
2446500	2447740	I'm kind of like
2447740	2451140	Honest, I don't know if I have the room on my Wii hard drive to fit that stuff
2451140	2455580	You know how many freaking virtual console games I have a sad amount sad amount
2456260	2457860	well
2457860	2462020	This person has listed gamer goals and I have to read some of these because I have to respond to some of them

2477140	2480780	Overrated special guests don't have guests anymore on x-play. Oh
2481340	2484460	Well, I guess they don't have viewers anymore. I guess on
2485060	2486780	live viewers

2551840	2554560	I'm good. This is one of the ones I wanted to talk about. I
2555200	2558480	Have a friend who's a game designer and she has a math degree
2559000	2562720	So just a word of warning you'd want to go in programming or math
2563320	2567820	Not something not or go in the art side of it and go into you know
2569040	2571720	Graphic design or digital art just letting you know

2609640	2612480	By the way, ask someone how to change your neck so we can give you your proper name

2619040	2623760	Lucky you Bobby, but I think the whole point though is that this person might not since we're on all games now
2623760	2625760	Are we gonna get into the e3 this year?
2625760	2630880	Frickin hope so. Yeah an article. Yeah, I know. We'll write articles. I'm a good writer

2673480	2676680	So what things like or at least get autographed pictures or something?
2676680	2681160	I never thought we'd be at that level where I cuz I totally feel like a picture of me

2730300	2737320	Time and even the signature the autograph before you here in studio. I know we're awesome. Well, here's the thing
2737320	2741440	Here's the thing here. Where's this guy live? Did he say no if you live near Pax?

2765000	2769600	Um, anyway, um last email is um, thanks for switching to all games radio
2769600	2775640	I couldn't even listen to you live on life through 65. Anyway, I'm happy you switched seamlessly, but down to business
2775640	2780760	I want to ask you guys are you actually going to air the fuck show and when?
2782120	2787400	Looking forward to it. Thanks for your time Zeppelin. Yeah, remember that we were supposed to do the fuck show
2788720	2792040	Fucking hell, I don't know if that's actually gonna happen next week
2792040	2795560	I just because I'm gonna be out of town most of the weekend and it's just it's
2795720	2800560	We can't say when it's gonna happen. We got to pick a show and not tell you I like that idea
2800560	2803400	It should just fucking happen whenever the fuck I
2804520	2809360	The fuck show will happen. It won't happen next week, but it'll happen before summer
2810720	2815880	Is that weird? Yeah, we have to have one listener in on it just because they have to keep tally, but
2816520	2820960	Well, we'll tell dark Tetsuya or somebody, you know, who's been listening forever that we know is good gonna do a good job
2820960	2824920	Keeping tally. But yeah, if you don't know what the fuck show is you listen last week's show
2824920	2828680	It's this completely idiotic and stupid idea. We had that is so funny
2828680	2833580	It makes us giggle like in only places that what they play calm snap can
2836380	2839120	By the way, how much do I love the wiki editors?
2839780	2843780	The people that work on our wiki which is the orange lounge radio dot wiki calm
2844040	2847920	How much do I love them especially namely and a lot of people are getting in on it now?
2847920	2854160	But namely AJ mix and dark Tetsuya have been doing probably about 80% of the work. If not a little more. I love this
2854400	2859400	here's the summary you go in oops you go into the page that says dream games, right and
2860400	2862400	Let's see. We have they're all accounted for
2862960	2868960	Sky's voice the game laser cats Loki's world of randomness rice princess presents boobies and pandas
2869620	2871960	forbidden Bomberman pen and paper
2871960	2877680	furries and then cosplayers versus furries and here's the new entry what they play calm snap a
2877880	2883960	Nintendo Wii game involving taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck
2889120	2892120	Beautiful a gold star for AJ mix who made that edit
2893160	2894360	You know
2894360	2897480	Someone else emailed something that I'm actually not going to
2897480	2902780	To really talk much about because I can't watch it while we're live, but someone sent me an engineer's guide to cats
2905240	2907320	Just the thought of that could be morbid
2907320	2914200	I think I'm just going well especially since Dan was showing Julie that South Park episode last night about sniffing cat butts and
2915440	2916920	so
2916920	2922400	That just sort of makes me think of that. I'll watch it later, but thank you whoever sent me an engineer's guide to cats
2922400	2926360	And that's it all right
2926360	2930760	If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange lounge radio.com is the place to go
2932320	2934860	Speaking of pen and paper the game Loki
2936400	2940080	Yes, speaking of pen and paper the game now
2940960	2947040	The game that we're referring to of course is lol never party alone. It's a multiplayer only game
2947720	2951200	Put out by age tech. It's actually kind of like
2951200	2954840	Pictionary sort of you basically draw
2955440	2957800	that will give you like I guess a
2958640	2960640	theme or a
2960660	2965840	statement or something like draw a funny clown, and then you have to draw a clown or something like that and
2967480	2970640	You know everybody draws it then one person votes on so it's like I guess
2971200	2974840	Pictionary meets apples apples, and then the winner gets a point
2975000	2980440	But the thing is as we said pen and paper of the game you can do this on pen and paper already
2980440	2984840	You don't need the buy game. Well unfortunately you won't be able to buy this game
2985520	2987520	in stores because
2987520	2988920	according to
2988920	2993620	The game's distributor age tech it will be available online only
2994360	2995680	so
2995680	2997680	Yeah, you won't find this in stores
2998880	3001800	That's all right buy a tablet of paper and pens instead
3001800	3008720	Oh just what is it surprising if what if you're playing it in a store?
3010360	3012080	Then it will be in a store
3012080	3013700	You can't buy it in a store though
3013700	3017140	What if you were downloading it while you're in the store and paying the money while you're in that store?
3017400	3023240	No, it's not downloadable. It's just that you're buying you have to buy it from their online store
3023280	3029500	What if you're in there? Oh, what if you have your laptop, and you're at a store, okay? I'm picky
3029500	3035980	Just forget it. Do you really need this game? I mean, it's not like what else did they sell online only electroplankton?
3036460	3040500	Yeah, I like electroplankton. I know but exactly that was a game. That was worth buying online
3041140	3046620	Lol, I don't know. I don't know about that one. You know you know what the the alternative to
3047140	3049140	Lol is hmm. It's
3050020	3052020	No open canvas
3052520	3054520	picto chat
3055100	3056760	Well guys
3056760	3060340	We're going to get into another segment. We do here on orange launch radio once in a while
3060340	3063140	and I kind of gave away what's coming earlier based on the music, but
3066660	3070180	That's right when you hear that happy music. You know something really fucked up happened
3070180	3072980	And it's probably time to give out another olr stupid award
3073740	3075740	this time
3075780	3083220	18 year old Jean-Pierre, Orla, Orla wiz Orla wick wiz Orla wick is ol
3083220	3087260	or le w icz or le was wiz
3087260	3093260	I don't even know how to say that he is on trial right now for first degree premeditated murder
3093500	3100140	Guess what him and his friend did they sound so happy they ambushed 26 year old Daniel Sorensen in
3100660	3104540	November they stabbed him in the back and then sawed off his head and burned his body
3105100	3109060	This was not a video game. This is real life. It is not funny when it happens in real life
3109060	3113420	It's not as offensive as two guys kissing though
3113420	3115420	Don't even
3115420	3117420	Oh my god this guy looks psychotic
3117420	3123860	I know seriously okay, so the trial is going on right now, but here it is. Here's what happened the defense is
3124660	3127700	Blaming hitman that's right hitman
3128420	3130820	Here it is from a cnn report quote
3130860	3136500	They dealt with it a video game called hitman that he used to watch and it was a video game where you got
3136500	3141420	Impressions that you would kill somebody hit them from their backside where they were not aware. They were being killed
3143060	3146180	But I don't know that sounds a little more like manhunt to me but
3147460	3149460	Regardless this guy's an idiot
3149660	3152340	Not just for what he did I mean that was stupid anyway
3152340	3156700	But for the fact that the defense and I guess the defense team wins the stupid award too
3156700	3158780	But trying to blame it on hitman I
3159580	3161580	mean come on I
3161580	3167240	Mean get it's one thing to stab somebody and kill them that way, but like I
3167940	3173740	That's insane like they like on a scale of one to ten one being like not really fucked up and ten being like super fucked
3173740	3176580	Up like stabbing someone and killing them is at least twelve okay
3176580	3182420	That's beyond fucked up, but stabbing them then cutting off their head then burning their body
3182700	3185840	That's like 11 D billion on that scale okay
3185840	3192960	so you've got issues, and you need to go away for a long time where we won't see you ever ever again and
3193480	3195760	Don't try to blame it on a video game ass
3200480	3202480	Stories like this make me angsty
3202480	3223360	Oh, you know what happens usually after the stupid award comes about of angst and we like to call that here our f-use of the week
3223360	3226080	Chuck soccer once you start us off tonight with the f-use of the week
3226080	3240800	Okay, my f-u of the week goes towards people who drive really really slow like grandma slow
3240800	3245760	When you're going the speed limit and they're going less than the speed limit
3245760	3250080	And I know I talk about bad drivers all the time, but oh my god all of them were in front of me today
3250080	3260480	And also an f-u goes towards the amounts of cleaning I've done in the past week in our house
3260480	3267200	But I did get something really awesome. I have a toy. I call it the doctor's cleaning tool. It's called a sonic scrubber
3268880	3273960	Nice and you use it for cars, and I used it for the bathroom instead, but anyway
3273960	3282160	Just all the dust that got kicked up from all the cleaning I've done for Dan's pinball gathering tonight
3282160	3289560	Has had my eyes bloodshot like all week, so f-u to dust too
3289560	3293560	Loki do you have any f-u's of the week?
3293560	3298560	F-u goes to this chair that I'm sitting on because it's horribly uncomfortable
3298560	3302560	We will try to find a cheap chair for you at IKEA or something I promise
3302560	3303960	IKEA has comfy plastic ones
3303960	3306560	I want to get another chair like that. That chair is awesome the one you sit in
3306560	3310360	I know they can't see it on just TV because you're secretive, but it's a very nice chair
3310360	3312360	Sorry, look is that it?
3312360	3314360	That's it. I got nothing else
3314360	3318560	F-u to my pancreas which continues to bother me. I've been having chest pains today
3318560	3323560	Although thankfully I've been getting a little bit better and speaking of food. I actually ate a full meal last night
3323560	3324160	It was very nice
3324160	3329960	I went to Mimi's and they have a low fat menu and they have a spaghetti marinara dish
3329960	3333760	It was actually pretty damn good for low-fat, but I'm so sick of this low-fat diet
3333760	3338360	I mean granted it's nice to have lost 25 pounds and all but I am so
3338560	3341960	Sick of eating low-fat like seriously when Loki brought in that pizza tonight
3341960	3349160	I'm like I would kill you for a slice of pizza Rob. What? I was going to let you know that I
3350160	3352160	actually do have a good number of
3352960	3359940	Low fat and low sugar recipes. Oh cool from my phase of South Beach that I would be more than happy to share with you
3359940	3362060	So you can enjoy some of the food that you're missing good time
3362060	3365800	So, you know what I'm craving right now though is like I I don't think it's low-fat though
3365800	3367960	I want like a teriyaki rice bowl or something
3367960	3370960	I guess just depends on who makes it and how they make it but oh that sounds so good right now
3373120	3373720	All right
3373720	3378840	Anyhow enough about food because I'm getting hungry because I haven't eaten dinner yet that will conclude the F use of the week and we'll
3378840	3380840	Get back into the show
3380840	3382560	with some more gaming news
3382560	3384560	well, we've already known that the
3384560	3390480	You know US and North America. We're gonna be getting a I guess limited-edition
3391440	3396080	Metal Gear Solid bundle with the game, of course an 80 gig system and
3398600	3405800	Also, I guess, you know the DualShock 3 controller well now there's also another bundle coming that's gonna be the
3406320	3412000	Gunmetal gray PlayStation 3. In fact, it was confirmed by Konami's Brandon Loreno
3412000	3419160	on the official PlayStation blog that this very very limited-edition system will be available in the North America as
3419480	3425880	Part of a special Metal Gear Solid 4 bundle. So I guess it's the same thing, but this one's Gunmetal
3426000	3428000	You know silver grayish
3428800	3430800	and
3431560	3437600	So I guess both these are gonna be scheduled to arrive around the game's release date of June 12th
3437600	3445480	But I good luck getting your Gunmetal gray they're gonna be super rare basically, yeah super rare
3445480	3449920	I bet I bet I know something that's even more rare and I know I can say something about this now because Bobby said it
3449920	3451920	On his show tonight. I can talk about this a little bit
3452520	3456200	All games radio which you know, we're a part of is going to be giving away
3456680	3461000	This is super duper rare an Xbox 360 Grand Theft Auto 4
3461000	3468040	Box, okay. There's only like 500 of these puppies in existence all games got one and they're giving it away and
3468720	3473760	Base and they're not giving it to you Loki. I'm sorry to say you're ineligible stupid rock star. Listen, okay
3473760	3475760	I played more of Grand Theft Auto
3476680	3480520	PSP multiplayer and trust me that's pretty painful
3480800	3484520	Okay, that game had some pretty bad multiplayer
3484520	3489800	but I loved it and we played it more than anybody any human on the face of this earth and
3489800	3493880	Yet, you know, no love for me. What the hell?
3494320	3500520	Well, here's the way it works on all games radio every show that's on the network gets to pick a finalist
3500600	3503080	Basically, it gets to do a contest to pick a finalist
3503080	3507600	So we'll be picking our finalist either next week or the week after but if you don't win with us
3507680	3513560	You might be able to win with Bobby black wolf. You might be able to win all games interactive video game outsiders
3514520	3517880	Platform nation, you know one of the you know countless other shows that all games radio has
3517880	3523440	Everybody is gonna every show is gonna send one finalist to a last round and I don't know what they're gonna do at that point
3523440	3529120	When the freaking mark echo, I mean, come on, man. They're just like throwing them away now. So stay tuned next week
3529120	3532680	We'll have more details. We may even do the qualifier next week. I'll post more on the website
3532680	3537400	I just I have to know the all games timetable either be next week or in two weeks. So we'll see
3538280	3541720	Okay back to the news. Yes news because ferrets are always
3542480	3544480	relevant to to my interests
3544480	3552080	a something else is relevant to my interest is the BBC and the we and they rhyme because the BBC on we is cool we
3553440	3555440	anyway, so
3555760	3563440	There is a an I player replay service that the BBC has that's going to be functional on the Wii and the service is
3563440	3565360	one that
3565360	3570040	It's actually already available on iPod touch and iPhone that will do
3570040	3576720	You limited by time different replays of BBC shows including Doctor Who torch wood
3577000	3581480	Which are two of my favorites and whatever else they want. So, uh, it's actually
3582680	3588280	It's for we owners in the UK. I actually want to try this on my on my iPhone. I would love to try it
3589320	3596160	But if anyone wants to actually see what's what's playing on there. The address is BBC co dot UK
3596160	3601600	Slash I player and you can see what they've got up for now. That's pretty sweet
3601600	3604360	I was reading this concept a little bit earlier for the show start
3604360	3606960	I'm like this is this is a great next step for the Wii
3606960	3611320	I mean talking about wanting to be like, you know a centerpiece in the living room with its news and forecasting
3611320	3613440	We talk about being able to bring television shows like that
3613440	3616620	I mean even more so the next like what if you didn't have to pay for it?
3616920	3619720	Well, I mean one thing though that I do want to mention
3620520	3622520	that might be a
3622520	3627440	A problem is that the BBC's website does IP check
3627840	3635160	For example when the Sarah Jane adventures were just coming out. You actually couldn't even look at their website. It would block it completely and
3635840	3638960	About I even use two different IP directors and it still had me blocked
3638960	3643520	so but just for what's on there right now as far as featured items is
3644560	3647940	Actually the last episode of Doctor Who that aired the other day
3649440	3651440	Which was called Pompeii the last day
3651440	3653440	There's also
3654280	3657520	Not dodi open house to buy or not to buy
3658640	3660400	Freaky Eaters
3660400	3663280	Dateline London. Yeah, if you care
3664840	3668960	There's some pretty good stuff on there love soup. I I would watch a lot of BBC shows
3668960	3673720	I hope I kind of secretly hope they'd bring it over here and a show little Britain a show that my husband likes is
3674120	3675560	Top Gear
3675560	3677560	He watches episodes of that on YouTube
3677560	3683780	Um, but Top Gear is also available to that. It's if you're a big, you know racing or car fanatic. That's a good show
3685400	3690320	All right, well, we'll see well this is kind of interesting it's been
3691440	3693440	How now maybe leaked out on?
3694560	3697720	When Animal Crossing for the Wii will be coming out
3698520	3700080	apparently
3700080	3704600	Apparently there is a calendar available for the club Nintendo
3704600	3710640	Folks, and of course, you know for April they have well, I should say they have different games for each month
3711040	3715360	The backgrounds and stuff. So for April, of course, they have Mario Kart Wii
3716060	3720640	Well guess what games in December, of course Animal Crossing
3720640	3724140	They have a bunch of picture of the characters and that that could just be a huge coincidence
3724560	3728900	Could be but I mean no last game that came out was on the DS and that was around
3729520	3731520	November December ish so
3731520	3735720	You know, it could be just a coincidence as come out. I'd be interested to see what's on the other months
3735720	3737920	You know just to see if that that's that's the thing
3737920	3742560	Yes, the thing was kind of missing like what are what's in the other months were some of the earlier games from this year in
3742560	3744560	The earlier months like did you have you know?
3744720	3750000	Smash Brothers brawl for March February, you know, like professor Layton or something for
3751080	3755760	February and it is a bit of a stretch, but we'll see well
3755920	3759280	We are about to wind down here and we'll be taking Skype calls very soon
3759280	3762000	If you want to give us a call one eight seven seven game
3762240	3765120	Olr or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio
3765120	3769760	Keep in mind that is different from the other all games shows for those of you guys that are new to our show tonight
3769760	3773080	Thanks to our new relationship with all games calm keep in mind
3773080	3777980	We do have a different phone number than the rest of our shows that are live. Sorry. That's right or interrupt real quick
3778400	3785840	They actually have someone actually has the calendar and it sounds like it may just be a coincidence because January was Mario Galaxy
3785840	3791380	February was we fit but this is all stuff. That's Japanese dates. So, I don't know
3792800	3794800	March was Mario Party
3795440	3801080	They had April's Mario Kart may looks like they had like Yoshi's Island
3802080	3804440	June something Metroid Prime related
3805400	3807200	like Kirby
3807200	3810320	Just all their stuff. Yeah, it's just it sounds like it's just random
3810320	3818440	All right. Well, this isn't so random. This is very scientific and statistical. It's next generation published a report this week
3818440	3820440	It's the top
3820680	3824120	100 selling video games of the last two months to 12
3824120	3829560	I'm sorry last 12 months not two months last 12 months compiled both across North America and Europe
3829600	3832460	Okay, and I promised Jamie some cooking mama
3832760	3837120	Did you know that cooking mama cook-off is the 98th top selling game in the past 12 months?
3837120	3841880	Four hundred and seventy K units moved between North America and Europe pretty cool
3841880	3845280	That's that's a lot even though the game was kind of crap compared to the DS
3845280	3847280	Like it lost a lot of magic on its way to the Wii
3847800	3853840	Kind of interesting to lend me yours. You can take it anytime. I'm not I'm not that excited about it
3853840	3857160	I'm just quickly looking through the list to see if there's anything else notable on it
3857160	3863480	I noticed boogie is in at number 87 and I don't know how I felt about boogie. It was a little bit corny
3863480	3869080	But it's a lot of people. I I know that are casual gamers really like that game, so
3869720	3875400	Let's see I'll try to wind it down here and just get to some of the top games that sold in the past 12 months
3875400	3877240	What do you think what would your guesses be?
3877240	3882960	What would you say was the number one selling game in the past 12 months just speculating because I know you haven't seen this story yet
3885880	3889340	Halo 3 good good choice evil 3 mario Galaxy
3889340	3895060	Okay, here's the top 10 number 10 was brain age 2 4 million units remember
3895060	3901060	This is North America and Europe combined for whatever reason doesn't count Japan though number 9 was Super Mario Galaxy
3901700	3905020	4.1 million units 8 was Assassin's Creed 4.9
3905460	3910800	7 was Pokemon Diamond and Pearl with 5 million 6 was need for speed pro street
3911060	3915660	5.4 million 5 was Madden NFL oh 8 5.7 million
3915660	3921180	4 was FIFA Soccer oh 8 because remember we brought Europe into the mix so you know a soccer game is going to sell
3921540	3928900	5.7 million as well number 3 this surprised me guitar hero 3 was the number 3 selling game of the past 12 months me I
3929540	3931540	Was just because it's so much more expensive
3932700	3937860	7.5 million units that doesn't surprise me, but I guess you consider all the systems this game is on
3938580	3943660	Number 2 Halo 3 8 million units. I was close yeah close
3943660	3948140	So you guys are both close the number one game though call of duty for modern warfare
3949820	3955060	8.3 million units yeah when you hear it, and then you think oh, yeah like seriously. I look at my friends list
3955060	3959540	There's always someone playing call of duty for always played the hell out of that game
3959580	3964820	Yeah, it's it's weird though because you know here on orange launch radio. That's not the type of game
3964820	3968740	We usually talk about it's not the type of thing we play, but I even said that I liked it
3968740	3974840	Yeah, we saw respect for it certainly weird imagine fashion designers number 66. Oh my God
3975060	3982700	You know what games not on this list imagine babies know what I have judgment. I have just not on the list that is correct
3983860	3988460	Good job. Loki. I did so notice some ps3 titles in there like I saw ratchet and clank in there somewhere
3989300	3990980	so
3990980	3994700	Well there you have it one more story then we're going to open up that skype line
3994700	3996380	And I don't know how it's going to run tonight
3996380	4000460	It might be kind of choppy because we have both justin TV and this higher bitrate streaming
4000460	4005620	I will have to can justin TV during this segment if we have problems just you know we got one more story
4005620	4011640	And it's a sweet one right Jamie. Yeah, it's really sweet and sappy makes my teeth hurt, but it's really cool
4012340	4019700	There is a guy and let me make sure that I pronounced his name correctly Brian Clema. I guess Clema kale I am a
4020620	4021900	who
4021900	4025240	by his own account made a custom level in
4025240	4032280	Super Smash Brothers Brawl this says Marry me and put the timer to infinite put peach Mario and
4032920	4040080	Kirby who is his intended fiancee's favorite character and just left the TV on so when she came home and turned on the TV
4040080	4044040	she's like oh, you're in the middle of the game, and then she saw that he had the ring in hand and
4044640	4049200	Look, he said look at TV again. She said yes, so I thought it was sweet. Oh
4049760	4053880	That's cute, and she proceeded to own him in Smash Bros. Brawl
4053880	4057880	I don't see how anyone can play on the Marry me level though
4058160	4063260	It'd be really freaking difficult to actually get out of the top part and land somewhere
4063260	4064160	You can beat somebody else up
4064160	4067400	You should put that level up for download for all the other nerds who want to do something like that
4067400	4071040	That's the Marry me level up. I'll tell you what though the best engagement story
4071040	4074860	I ever heard was dark soccer is that was my favorite tell the all-games crowd
4075520	4079740	Your engagement over a particular movie. I love this story
4080440	4082440	Dan and I
4082440	4088360	We well we had known each other. You know online for quite a while and when I moved out here we on
4089040	4095000	Valentine's day we were watching UHF. We were you know kind of broke. I didn't have a job and he was
4095520	4097680	working telemarketing somewhere, but
4098480	4103280	we were watching UHF and eating French baguettes and
4105360	4111920	Spinach dip and drinking that the kosher blackberry wine. I love how you remember every detail. It's so girly, but cute
4111920	4115240	Oh, shut up. I remember lots of details about lots of stuff and
4117360	4123920	We just sort of mutually decided to get married it was like we should get married okay when sometime okay, I
4124920	4130440	Just think the fact you got married over UHF is so funny. We're now brought us together. It's time to drink from the firehose
4131200	4133200	Yeah
4133200	4141480	Marvel in the oatmeal you should have had that at your wedding the firehose we didn't actually have a
4142240	4147800	Wedding yeah, but at your you know you should have at least you know outside the courthouse
4148160	4151600	Black corset and a purple skirt and boots
4152520	4154680	When I got married it's awesome
4154680	4161400	And then I had cake and it was good and then and then we went home, and I slept in the next day
4161400	4163080	Okay
4163080	4168880	Romantic odd one in chat says God if I had a nickel for every time I got laid because of UHF and
4170160	4175760	DJ Morpheus you'd owe money. Yeah DJ Morpheus follows up with a zinger you'd owe five bucks
4178200	4182800	What's that old saying great minds think like me no Dan says it great minds think like us all right
4183520	4189080	Skyplines open one eight seven seven game. Oh LR again. I apologize a little bit experimental
4189080	4192760	We'll see how this first call works out. Hi. You're on orange lounge radio. Who's this?
4195960	4198440	Hello GS 68 what is on your mind my friend
4199920	4205200	Um I have a question for a low low key about my currently all right. What's up?
4205200	4207720	Logie or what's up GS 68 for Loki?
4209320	4213400	Um have you played online yet? Yes?
4213400	4225000	Um how's the online like if someone disconnects will they will they get replaced by CPU without you knowing like in Brawl?
4225000	4232260	I don't think anyone disconnected in the ones that I played, but like you can choose you know between matches or whatever
4233160	4235900	To leave or continue on to another race or something like that
4237640	4239960	It's just sometimes a little difficult to get connected
4239960	4244800	And it's kind of cool that once you're like if you're waiting in queue to you know join up the next game
4244800	4251080	You actually watch the other people playing their games, so you can kind of switch between different cart views and stuff like that
4251800	4255960	But I didn't actually see anyone get disconnected off there, so I don't know
4256800	4259360	I'd assume they they would lose points
4259840	4266580	Because the way the rankings work you start off with 5,000 points when you first start playing and then depending on where you place
4266580	4271020	um within the 12 you'll lose up to like
4272060	4278980	64 points and then gain maybe 64 points, so I'd imagine if if they disconnected whatever
4281300	4283300	No, sorry go ahead
4284100	4285100	I'm
4285100	4289500	Carroms saying that they can't hear me. I have to mic turn all the way up you were a little quiet
4289500	4293820	But that's okay. It might be on our end. Just keep talking don't listen. Don't let them bully you in chat. Oh
4293820	4295820	oh
4295860	4303260	Anyways, that's what turns me off from playing Super Smash Bros. Online in the with anyone mode cuz if
4303720	4310940	The game will disconnect you a game will please disconnect with a CPU and not tell you what's the point of playing online anymore?
4310940	4316500	I mean, I'm gonna just play against three CPU characters honestly gs68 there really wasn't one
4316500	4319360	And I think they just put it in as an afterthought to say they did it
4319360	4324660	That's my honest answer because it sounds like Mario Kart we has a much more robust type of online like I didn't even know it
4324660	4326900	Had that whole like ranking it has leaderboards
4326900	4331660	I have like a bunch of stuff and you can look at your friends and see where they are like you know the different times
4331660	4334980	And stuff you can download the top you know
4335500	4338860	Rankers their ghost data and race it if you want to
4339740	4344580	But not all that stuff works too. Well right now because of you know they're getting hammered
4344580	4350300	So like trying to download ghost data didn't work for me. I I tried a few times, and it didn't work in fact
4350300	4353180	I had to hammer online and finally get into a game
4353580	4359780	It took me about 10 tries, and I finally got to play an online game, but well you know that'll get fixed eventually
4359780	4363380	I'm sure but right now. It's just you know getting hammered pretty bad
4364820	4369060	All right any other comments gs68 or questions oh?
4369060	4374820	Yeah, I'm you didn't nominate any games for all our March Madness right you know we send in our lists later
4374820	4380100	We we got in there late, so we weren't in on the nomination process for all our March Madness and just for the benefit because
4380660	4384180	Folks who only listen to us in the podcast may not know and all games folks may not know
4384740	4390180	DMN one of our other personalities from the old orange launch radio station kind of was rounding up this March Madness
4390500	4394820	Competition but involving video games. I'll be honest. It's very similar to the type of thing
4394820	4400660	You've probably seen on game facts in the past, but it wasn't with characters
4400660	4401300	It was with games
4401300	4406180	And he was trying to find the best game of all time of which super Metroid ended up winning last week
4406460	4410580	For which I got called every name in the book because I it was separated by one vote
4410580	4415380	Yes, even amongst all the chatters all the hosts in studio of which we had quite a few guests last week
4415380	4420220	It was separated by one vote and I cast the deciding vote to make super Metroid win over Chrono Trigger
4420220	4422220	And I took a lot of shit for it
4422220	4427500	But yeah, we did not actually send in the qualifier list because DMN closed it off early
4427500	4429940	But what would you want to ask about that? Yeah?
4431060	4438420	Yeah, what I would like ask him like our listeners like what games they wish she had nominated but I
4439380	4440780	mean that's
4440780	4443500	What I mean some games that are very
4444660	4447300	big like we're on the brackets and
4447300	4451580	So basically like I see that the kind of thing like you know what was missing
4451580	4456420	What should have been there? What what wasn't on the brackets that should have been? I think honestly you'd I?
4456740	4460380	Think the sampling was a pretty good sampling of like you know the
4461620	4468020	Mainstream best games that there were out there. I think honestly you would be diving into everyone's niche gaming
4468580	4473060	To see what it is they missed you know if you're an RPG fan you probably said oh
4473060	4479860	Where was grandia or where was you know some some niche RPG if you're a racing game fan?
4479860	4481860	You were probably like oh, where was you know?
4482700	4485780	Burnout or whatever it is so well
4486780	4492220	I mean I surprised to see that like obscure games like massive to the allegiance are the brackets yet
4492220	4499780	I gave like Castlevania simply that which is what which did so much pretty Castlevania series it what it basically took
4499780	4501540	To
4501540	4503020	the action
4503020	4509540	They can buy 2d action adventure gameplay RPG elements like that game was not on there
4510220	4512380	Yeah, Castlevania is one of my favorite games, too
4512380	4514900	You know if I'd nominated it would have been definitely in my top five
4514900	4517380	But I got to finish this up because we can move on to other calls
4517380	4520820	But I will say this we might try it again in a few months
4520820	4522140	Let the dust settle a little bit
4522140	4527420	Maybe when there's another thing going on now that we have the additional resources of all games comm maybe we can do something a little
4527420	4533980	More epic and maybe a little more inclusive of everybody's tastes so, but we'll see it's gonna be interesting though
4533980	4537540	Cuz when you throw like if we were to do something all-encompassing of all games
4537580	4543540	You know you take a show like all games interactive and a lot of those folks are really into the sports titles and the call
4543540	4546180	Of duties and the things we don't give enough time to on this show
4546180	4551260	So I think it would be very interesting to bring those two worlds together and see what still comes out on top
4551360	4554780	We'll see what happens gs68 we got to let you go so we can get some more calls him
4554780	4558140	But thanks so much for the phone call buddy. All right. Take care. All right all right
4558140	4560480	We're gonna take some more calls one eight seven seven game

4613180	4617220	The lines are open now that last call didn't go so well, so I have to edit that out

4674780	4677260	Cross-promotion, that's awesome work. It was
4678020	4684180	Surprised you guys didn't do it soon enough it did slide through 65. You know probably like a year. You know you're earlier
4684180	4689380	I mean yeah hindsight is always 20 20 isn't it look you got a question. What's on your mind?
4690540	4695580	Basically all right since I managed to get a PSP last Friday and managed to get a hat
4695580	4700260	I need some good. You know some good apps. Okay. I mean you I
4701420	4706100	Know you got to help me out with a little bit of something, but why else can I put on my PSP?
4706820	4708420	Turn the homebrew
4708420	4710420	What now I'm sorry I?
4710780	4712780	Can't I couldn't understand him
4712780	4715940	Um I just heard I just turned down the bandwidth on Justin TV
4715940	4720060	So hopefully we'll get a little better. He wants to know like PSP apps. He should have I don't know
4720060	4725820	I haven't downloaded anything in a long time. I guess emulators. I mean that's kind of cool, but uh you know PSP radio, maybe
4726700	4728700	I
4728940	4730940	Don't know
4730940	4732940	Really downloaded a number
4733180	4734700	I
4734700	4740180	Know Zaku you should get the you you should get the PSP radio thing in the latest firmware
4740180	4743620	And you can listen to all games radio now on the PSP radio anywhere you go
4745580	4750140	You got you got the latest firmware hacks already got that one actually
4751020	4754660	Zaku you reminded me of something and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but did you see this?
4755180	4761380	Loki I'm curious if you saw this Sony sent out a poll earlier this week basically asking people. Why do you hack the PSP?
4761900	4764620	Yes, I kind of try. Why do you hack?
4764620	4770340	The basically they sent out a poll saying like you know and it asked people to rate things on a scale like one to seven
4770340	4772300	Going like you know yes, I agree or no
4772300	4772740	I don't agree
4772740	4778260	You know like I hack my PSP because I like the challenge or I hack my PSP to give it features of the PSP
4778260	4781100	I have my PSP to steal games kind of interesting
4783820	4784900	I
4784900	4786900	Hack it just to spite you
4787020	4789020	How about how about a couple good websites?
4789020	4793980	Zaku can keep an eye on because really it's about what you want to do with the PSP so had a couple good websites for
4793980	4796100	I guess psphacks.com
4797460	4799460	pspupdates.qj.net
4801540	4807020	Stuff like that I mean those would be two websites I'd check they have a lot of downloads on there and stuff
4807660	4808820	right
4808820	4813260	I just barely had trouble today. Just getting some proper emulators. You know
4813900	4819040	But you know at least I know people you know like you Loki and other folks that can you know help me out
4819040	4825360	That's good. You gotta get back on that scene. I mean three latest M33 is pretty damn good right now
4826160	4828160	Especially when your PSP is overclocked
4828880	4832080	Alright Zaku we got to let you go so we can get more calls any quick final thoughts
4832720	4837360	I'm gonna get your PSP hacked. Don't leave you. You know fuck Sony's
4838120	4843320	Endurance all right. Just know somebody went up in door, but battery. That's all you need to know all right
4843440	4845440	It's all about the battery take care, buddy
4845440	4852600	1 8 7 7 game olr. I'm hoping our next call will be a little better with the bandwidth because I dropped Justin TV a lot
4852600	4857160	In the video they're probably just seeing a still picture in there right now. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
4857800	4860360	Hi guys, this is footy monster. See that's a lot quicker
4860360	4865680	It was like no and the footy monsters in Argentina, so we might just have to do that every week on just TV anyway
4865680	4870240	Sorry, we're learning about our show live. What's on your mind footy monster noise at all
4870240	4875640	I just want to share a couple of things for a quick first off congrats on your new home. Thank you
4875640	4880360	We like it. Hey quick dark Sakura put some of the nice silverware here from all games in your purse
4881120	4883120	Okay
4883880	4885880	All right, sorry, what's up?
4886120	4890480	Well, you know that story you had earlier about Brazil and the whole bully thing
4891200	4893200	Yes, I do well
4893360	4896720	Here's the thing as far as understand since it's pretty close from here
4896720	4903120	The only country that I know that's in South America that has any sort of official distribution of anything is actually Chile
4903120	4908500	And they have Microsoft like Sony doesn't release anything officially and Nintendo doesn't release anything officially
4908920	4913720	Argentina used to have official distribution of Nintendo products, but those that was like in 1995
4914160	4920620	So I'm thinking and and this is just a theory that you know anything that happens in Brazil
4921160	4925380	Rockstar will never care for because it's not that they were sending their game to Brazil
4925380	4932180	Because they are not doing it. It's just you know retailers importing the game and having a great market so to speak um
4933660	4937220	You know what's interesting though is that it's interesting in Nintendo doesn't support
4937460	4940220	South America more because like I was just kind of noticing
4940220	4944220	I was just looking at some of the box art on a recent game drew was here last week
4944220	4948340	And he gave me back super paper Mario because he borrowed it and I was just kind of eyeing the back of the box
4948340	4950540	And kind of noticing how like it's interesting on Nintendo
4950540	4955740	Puts the back of their boxes in three different languages all at once now like you look at the back of a box of a
4955740	4960580	Nintendo game it's in English French and Spanish all in the back, but you read some of the fine print yes
4960580	4966980	I was very bored it talks about how the game is only for distribution in the United States Canada hence the French and
4967500	4972240	Latin America they say hence the span of Latin America is like Puerto Rico
4972240	4975820	Which is basically the u.s.. And Mexico is basically the u.s.. Which well
4975820	4979100	I think some of our Mexican listeners might disagree, but but
4979100	4981700	Yeah, but at the same time the distribution of products
4981700	4986380	I do find it interesting because then they're basically saying well Latin America is just Mexico
4986380	4991560	It is kind of interesting that they are cutting off the rest of the countries south of Mexico
4991560	4996620	Well, no not really. I mean considering the economies that we have here. It's not that surprising
4996620	4999940	I mean who's over here what you have to spend to play a game?
4999940	5005860	I mean I was just the other day at the shop buying a 360 game well attempting to and it was like 90 US dollars
5005860	5012580	So I'm not gonna go buy a game for that price, so if Nintendo had to officially release their games support the region
5012740	5014740	We think the prices of games are gonna be
5015500	5022300	You know and they I mean they're not gonna sell at what people here could buy because they will have no profit and even worse
5022300	5027620	You know people from the US would import from South America, and it's the same thing right and pay cheaper true
5027620	5029760	It would never work. I guess that's true. I
5030420	5033940	Guess we had to get the realist perspective so in the mean in the meantime
5033940	5037220	How are you getting your games footy remind our listeners? How do you get your games?
5037220	5043100	Do you just have to pay the mark up or do you import or what actually I got a 360 quite recently I?
5044260	5050080	Probably January, and I had the option of flashing the bias and just you know like lucky
5050080	5052980	Look at us in one of his 360s and part of my games
5052980	5058960	But I actually really like the live experience, and I actually bit the bullet then whenever I go to Chile games
5058960	5065460	They're a pretty and another cheap, but they're competitive prices with the u.s.. I seen I could buy Mass Effect with 50 bucks
5065460	5068800	Or the other day I found lost Odyssey for 45 bucks
5068800	5071900	Oh nice, so you know it's like the prices are even sometimes
5071900	5076320	They're even cheaper like a god deal a for new seal for 20 bucks, so
5077220	5081980	What I could what I did is just actually go there because I have family there and whenever I make a trip
5081980	5086060	I just bring two or three games with me. You know because here. It's like $100, but over there
5086060	5092660	It's since Microsoft official distributes the games. It's totally you know possible to actually buy original games so right now
5092660	5097820	I'm buying original games and just doing it on ps2. I had to back. You know buy backups
5097820	5100980	That's all you could do and on my DS. It's I do the same thing
5101100	5104260	It's very interesting footy to hear you kind of talking openly about
5104500	5109820	Pirating games which you know has ruffled some feathers in the past here on this show with some of our listeners who are against pirating
5109820	5111820	Which you know I understand
5111820	5113820	Let me let me make this straight
5114340	5118140	It's interest, but it's interesting though footy when it's your only option
5118140	5119500	You know like you're talking about I mean
5119500	5125620	It's that or smuggle your games from Chile or not play games because really I mean just because you don't have money
5125980	5130460	Your option is not stealing. You know I do because I am fully aware that I'm doing something
5130460	5134800	That's not entirely legal or morally you know correct, but I have that better
5134800	5138540	I will this is a small anecdote here when I was a kid
5138540	5142340	I used to go to a computer shop to get my computer games in floppy disks
5142340	5145820	And I would go my floppy disk that I would buy in a box at a retailer
5146180	5149580	Go there, and you know look at through a list of games and ask them for a game
5149580	5153780	And they would I would pay them and I would go home to me that was totally normal and reasonable
5153780	5160940	That was how you got games right only later. I understood that that's illegal, but that was the way you did it here
5161460	5165900	Hmm, so there's another culture of original games here there. I mean really there isn't
5165900	5171940	So that's part of the problem as well piracy is just so rampant you know that it's like the way it is
5171940	5174860	It's like go to China and say you know with the same argument. It will not work
5174860	5179460	I guess it's so interesting to hear from around the world kind of the way things work because sometimes
5179460	5181620	We're in our little bubbles in these other countries
5181620	5186220	We live in so what I love about the internet and doing these podcasts and talking to people from around the world as you get
5186220	5188660	To hear you to hear from gamers everywhere footy
5188660	5191280	We got to wrap up and let you go, but anything else you want to say to our listeners
5191420	5194780	That's pretty much it guys. I guess I'll talk to you later. All right. Good luck footy. Take care
5194780	5196780	YouTube
5197460	5199720	Smuggles his games from Chile amazing
5201100	5203100	Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
5204100	5207860	This is the excuse next to be a second time and hopefully more stable way
5207860	5214140	Then you sound millions light-years better hello, Tony. I know you sound telephony probably cuz he's on the telephone
5214140	5219040	He's on the 877, but that's all right. Yeah, what's on you? I blame Skype. I blame Vista. I blame
5219040	5224860	I calm crap and you know everything else I can blame. It's not my life is five. Don't forget to blame them. Oh
5225640	5231420	Yeah, sure by 365 screw the RA the older fault. All right, and the police. All right
5232200	5234200	Jason what's on your mind?
5235460	5237460	Two short things and one quick thing
5238200	5242980	And one longer thing. Did you know that they made an impossible mission remake on the Wii?
5242980	5248320	Yes in Europe. Where is it here? I want it. Gimme gimme gimme
5249620	5255340	On my video game shelf come over and play it sometime. Shut up. Did you import it from Europe?
5256140	5263060	No, it was in the we went to Best Buy we were checking out and it was just sitting in those discount bins
5263180	5264540	What I looked at it
5264540	5270680	I laughed it said I'm getting this and bid and I've already played it then the game must come out here under the radar. I
5270680	5277840	Yeah, it doesn't have any it's obviously not all it works on our TV without anything special, you know
5277840	5279840	You use freeloader any of that stuff, right?
5281160	5284920	Well shit, I'm gonna go get but I'm gonna go pick that up tomorrow then. All right, cool
5284920	5288880	Thanks for the heads up. Hold up. Well, I didn't even know it came out here. That's great
5288880	5292400	It's cuz it didn't it did it did not it only came out in the DS
5293040	5299560	Yeah possible mission DS 10 bucks on Amazon. All right. Well, we'll see I'm gonna have to pick it just cuz I'm sure
5299560	5304840	It plays like crack at the box. I'll look for more logos. I will take a picture and show you guys
5304840	5308560	I it's not that I don't believe you. Oh here. Here's the best way to tell
5308560	5314080	Here's the best way to tell Jason see if it has a rating an ESRB rating on it because if it doesn't oh, yeah
5314080	5318240	Then it's different overseas. Aha. That's the way to tell. So anyway, what was the other?
5318240	5321280	What was the other story with little or what was the other story right now?
5321280	5326080	But the I'd barely they're watching Mulan Roo, so it's kind of noisy out there and I want to make too much of a ruckus
5326080	5329560	No, what are they singing? What are they singing along? No
5330560	5335080	But I heard them laughing uncontrollably just a minute ago. So good enough. I guess Oh girls
5335600	5337600	All right. Oh, yes, of course
5338080	5344440	I completely forgot what the second thing is. So I'll just skip to the last thing. All right farms is exceedingly intelligent
5344800	5346760	Yes, he is. I
5346760	5351040	Was obviously listening to the interview since I made it back in time to be able to listen to the show
5351040	5357840	And the discussion along the lines of XNA and we wear and everything opening up new opportunities. It's
5358520	5366100	Opening up another avenue for developers of the sort to showcase their talent, but it's not going to be a
5366960	5372080	It's going to be the same thing with indie and underground games. We already have through a different medium
5372920	5375480	It's you know, so the ones that are really good
5375480	5381560	There will be that one game and then the talent from the studio or just a or just a specific individuals can be hired
5381560	5383920	Onto a big-name studio and the cycles going to continue
5384240	5387240	It's a it's a great new app a new absolutely
5387280	5394680	But it's not going to fundamentally change the landscape of indie games being easily accessible and open to everybody and it was just very
5395480	5402200	Interesting to hear somebody else. I mean go figure developer especially was it's very interesting to hear him say the exact same thoughts
5402200	5406280	That I would have on such a thing. It's a great thing, but it doesn't change the landscape, but and
5407080	5411760	Plus the fact that you know, he's in another country too. So you kind of get you know, that whole thing
5411760	5414800	I was just talking about with footy monster hearing from gamers around the world hearing
5414800	5420500	It's still the same idea over there. Not that there's you know, obviously all the all the companies are in Australia doing business
5420500	5426480	It's it's not that radically different from what it is over here in Europe or what have you but still still interesting that it all
5426480	5429380	Comes to that kind of same thought. I I don't know
5429380	5433760	Maybe I blew the XNA thing out of proportion a little bit when we first heard it about it on the show
5433760	5440040	But I still think it's going to be a pretty radical, you know, it's just like YouTube didn't change the internet
5440760	5444280	Completely, but it had a great impact that was felt
5444280	5447320	you know what I mean and live people know what YouTube is and where I
5447680	5452380	Honestly think XNA is going to be a YouTube of sorts for gaming. That's kind of how I feel
5453200	5458080	Did you play those little community XNA what two-week trial games that they had up there? Yeah, some of them were fun
5458080	5465800	Yes, yes that they were it's I don't know that it's gonna have the same I completely understand your comparison
5465800	5468880	but I don't think it's gonna have the same impact as YouTube just because
5469480	5474400	Gamers the the XNA toolkit as I've talked to Bobby about the past and other various things
5475120	5480900	Apparently the XNA toolkit is exceedingly interesting, but it doesn't lower the bar YouTube lowered the bar
5480900	5484740	You take a video clicking the buttons and you're done. I guess that's true. This is
5484740	5491380	Yeah, this is very special and it is a great Avenue, but it's not gonna fundamentally change everything
5491380	5492140	So, okay
5492140	5492820	I you know
5492820	5497060	I am comparing apples to oranges a little bit but I still kind of think that whole concept where it's gonna be a lot
5497060	5500460	Easier for the people that can do it to get their stuff out there because you know
5500460	5503960	You look at some of those little trial games that came out, you know games like the dishwasher
5504620	5510300	Jelly car were yards better than Yaris. You know what I mean? They were a while ago
5510300	5514580	It's the loop and some of the other, you know, there's been some other junk on expo
5514580	5519940	I hate to say it but the Tron ports weren't all that great like they could have done better and some of the other classic
5519940	5521940	Game ports, you know what I mean?
5521940	5526060	Yeah, I just think you know put it put these new game developers me interesting
5526900	5531820	these new games can certainly hold a candle to classic remakes and
5532480	5534480	Shit like yours. Yeah
5534480	5540560	Jason we got a wrap up here so we can sign off for the night. It's already midnight 30 on the East Coast
5540880	5543400	Do you have any quick final thoughts for us? I
5544680	5549200	Wish I knew with all I wanted to say, but I forgot so good night. Well, you can always call us next week
5549320	5551320	Good night. Absolutely. Bye
5551680	5557480	Our fearless webmaster VX Jason XV. We love him here on the program. That's gonna do it for the skype line tonight

5560640	5563960	We're gonna wrap up the show. But first we got to get some last-minute news
5563960	5566440	I'm gonna check in with Loki and see if there's any last-minute news
5568080	5572360	Not really much but it's kind of interesting it looks like
5572840	5577000	There's a hacking group blaze team that has released a hacked
5577000	5583640	We virtual console game that they've broken the encryption on so that's a whole
5584200	5587320	Big old can of worms that Nintendo probably doesn't want opened
5588120	5589560	and
5589560	5593960	Then there's some other interesting things castle
5595000	5601360	Crashers, it looks like it's gonna have some new characters including a bear that fights with a fish and
5602800	5609560	You also I guess get little I don't know helper pets or something like that. They have a floating cat
5610400	5613120	It's kind of funny. I can't wait for this game to come out a
5613120	5620800	A floating cap. Yeah, it's an animal orb. It says the cat who will add to your agility and strength
5622960	5624760	Interesting I
5624760	5626760	Don't know. It's it's cute
5627320	5633980	Rosteel UT says the ESRB org lists impossible mission for DS PS 2 PSP and we I gotta go look for that
5634320	5640240	They have yeah scratch paws the cat which is a cute name for a cat scratch paw. I'll let a cute
5640960	5642600	they also have
5642600	5646360	There are some other pictures in here. They have like a little bird and a dog and

5703020	5707340	All right, we're gonna wrap up. We're running pretty long tonight on our first all-game show, but that's all right
