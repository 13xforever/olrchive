449	5511	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5871	14715	To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15415	19057	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19994	24678	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast.
24798	27961	We now tape live on allgames.com every Sunday night.
28021	29042	We got a small little crowd.
29082	36129	Hello to everybody in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, who are listening to us and our brand new sound quality as well.
36229	38030	Lots of compliments on the sound of the show tonight.
38691	39572	We're excited to be here.
40132	42815	We got lots more stuff for you in part B, more gaming news.
42895	43896	We have the mailbag.
44176	46338	We're giving away a stupid award tonight and...
46678	50820	We've got an interview with somebody pretty rad, Farbs, the man behind Rom Check Fail.
50840	52421	We'll be talking to him very shortly.
53141	55042	But first, more gaming news.
56083	56563	Yes, Loki?
56723	56963	Yes.
58144	67909	Anyways, so this is not a big surprise because we've been seeing sorts of similar bands with other rock star games.
68049	70711	But this time, Brazil has banned Bully.
72111	93401	of course you know before the whole banning problem was Manhunt 2 now for whatever reason they've deemed it inappropriate for sale and the ban has prevented the game from being imported distributed sold or promoted on the websites and stores in the country apparently Brazilian distributors retailers
94542	96503	We'll have 30 days to comply with the ban.
110652	112033	Not acceptable.
112973	120496	Apparently, of course, Take-Two will not have a material impact on the sales of their popular title.
122436	124297	Doesn't sound like they're going to appeal it.
126138	130059	If you're in Brazil and you want to play Bully, oh well, guess you're out of luck.
130342	131242	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
160054	160834	It's in a school.
161055	162736	They haven't played the game.
162756	165237	They didn't see what content's in the game.
165297	169339	They're just, oh, because it's in a school and bullies in the title must be because you're a bully.
170860	171541	So we don't like it.
172141	173202	I'd be curious to hear.
173222	175423	I know we've got to have some listeners in Brazil.
175723	177104	Because we've got listeners from around the world.
177144	179245	I'd be kind of curious to hear this from their perspective.
179905	183087	And I want to know, can you go walk into your big game stores there?
183107	184828	I don't know if you have the same type of things we do here.
184848	187170	Well, they have 30 days to comply, so go quick.
187650	187770	Okay.
188210	190851	I'm curious, can you walk into a store and buy Bully on the PlayStation 2?
191571	193771	Or have you been able to do that in the past?
193811	194952	That's what I'm kind of curious about.
196632	197772	We'll see.
197852	200313	DarkSakura, what do you think about banning video games in countries?
201773	202333	Retarded.
204114	209375	I think that banning anything is...
212065	213105	Unless we're banning the ferret.
213586	213766	No.
213846	214266	Just kidding.
216006	220928	I understand to an extent why people, why things are illegal.
221168	226390	You know, why certain things that they think might be harmful to the development of children.
226410	229311	But, you know, I believe that it's not the government's place to decide.
229351	230351	It's the parents' place to decide.
232796	239480	I guess despite all our bitching in Part A about the way society is right now, I guess we should be thankful where we live in a place where at least we have that decision to make.
239840	241641	Where you don't see the country banning things.
241781	243222	They'll just give a shit for it.
243422	243782	Oh well.
246303	250604	All right, well, moving on to other, you know, I don't know if I would call this happy news.
250624	253684	I don't think it's really happy for these people that were working at Develop.
254484	263646	Develop was a gaming company, and unfortunately, they have just lost some projects because the staff was cut from 25 down to just six senior staff.
264726	271968	President Michael Scandizzo, though, says, I guess he's optimistic, he says, if somebody came in tomorrow and said, here's a whole bunch of money, can you get back up and running?
272288	274308	Then by Monday, we could be back up and running.
274648	274968	Hehehehehehe
297890	303352	So, if you were hoping for Yaris 2, I don't know if that's really going to happen now.
303392	305753	I guess I kind of feel bad for these guys, though.
306514	310555	They were probably paid a crap load of money for what couldn't have been a too difficult a game.
310595	313817	They might have had all these other projects we'll never know about that could have been pretty rad.
314397	316117	And they couldn't get one right.
318398	319679	But, I mean, it was Yaris.
319699	322280	If you're hoping for Yaris 2, then you're probably a masochist.
323881	324581	I don't know.
324721	326642	Ajustin in chat says, let them die.
327847	329789	Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com if you want to participate.
329889	330810	Can't save them all.
331831	332492	I guess that's true.
332512	334194	Don't worry, EA's hiring, right?
334574	335635	Just kidding.
336937	339179	Anyway, can I give us some good news?
339860	349630	We actually have a video now of a new character for Street Fighter 4 who is named Rufus, and he's actually bigger than E. Honda.
351569	359876	and he's supposedly really fast for being bigger than E. Honda so interesting there's also another character called El Fuerte
362694	366136	Who is supposed to be just an overall playable character.
366276	369177	I don't really see anything, though, about how the character moves.
369357	370698	He's a Mexican wrestler.
371258	372098	Hey, that's cool.
372378	373499	I like the luchadores.
373739	375080	He's actually pretty fast.
375140	377761	I've watched some gameplay footage of him.
378741	382103	Now, Rufus, though, that guy is pretty fat.
382203	383423	He kind of reminds me a lot of...
384884	385565	Jack Black, Nacho Libre
402335	406138	DJ Janai in chat says, King Hippo is the king of fat dude characters in games.
406558	406818	Yes.
406898	407479	True statement.
407899	408920	Whatever happened to King Hippo?
409200	415604	Okay, so I'm looking at this El Fuerte, and he's actually pretty cool.
417906	422409	He fights very much in a, sort of a Vega style, I'm thinking.
422889	424530	But it is very, yeah.
426452	426612	Yeah.
427051	432573	DarkTetsuya in chat, it throws back to another Capcom classic, says he reminds me of one of the characters in Slam Masters.
432933	434134	Remember Saturday Night Slam Masters?
434654	438196	Oh my god, this guy is hideously fast.
438236	442177	He actually sort of reminds me of, who was that guy from Art of Fighting with the cookies?
443578	444638	Oh god, I don't remember.
444658	446099	The one with the green outfit and suspenders?
446724	449585	No, that was Chang.
449685	450845	That was Fatal Fury.
451005	451545	Fatal Fury.
451565	452266	That was Fatal Fury.
452326	453886	Was his name Chang something?
453906	454366	Yeah, something.
454586	455707	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
455727	456667	I know I've seen Art of Fighting.
456787	457567	Yes, he threw cookies.
457927	462188	Rufus is kind of like if I kept eating and eating and eating and eating and then became a fighter.
463669	465969	He has jiggle.
466530	467570	He has belly jiggle.
469117	469938	He looks like Pom!
470698	474541	He looks like Pom in Homestar Runner.
475401	477963	Lots of diverse characters apparently coming to Street Fighter 4.
478403	479564	I'm kind of excited by this.
479624	481785	It sounds like there's a lot of people in Street Fighter 4.
482065	484747	Not only do you have the original fighters, now you have some of these new people too.
484767	487849	We have the Crimson Viper, other people we've heard about in previous shows.
488489	490691	Street Fighter 4 is going to be a good time, I hope.
492011	493132	But the question is, will it blend?
493732	494293	Will it blend?
495033	495353	Maybe.
495514	497315	I don't know if Rufus can fit in the blender.
498422	508768	Now, this is interesting, and once again, goes to show you that the Sony platforms are just not that safe against hackers.
509569	514652	Apparently, though, there's been a tool that's been developed called PS3 Proxy.
515172	525418	And what this program has done is actually allowed people to be able to download the PlayStation Home beta without actually having to participate in the beta.
525879	526779	So they're able to...
528400	534783	Modify a few files that they've downloaded from a server to allow them to download the beta even though it's not available to them.
536244	547929	Word is right now, though, that you're unable to actually play the beta, but there has been some video of people that have been able to play the beta despite the fact that it was previously thought you couldn't.
548409	557914	Either way, though, the thought is that it's going to be public pretty soon anyways, so might as well just wait a few weeks for it to come out, but
558274	566380	In the meantime, though, it's very interesting, though, that you can download it as, you know, it's not that difficult from what I was reading into.
566400	568782	I just haven't gone around to actually trying it yet.
569423	571304	Where is freaking home already?
571684	577789	I mean, they've been talking about this for over a year now, you know, and we have yet to really see much more than screenshots.
578690	584254	Well, that's probably hanging out with Spore and I'm sorry, but that's the same thing forever.
584474	585515	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
614272	616015	But really, it's not right around the corner.
616836	620902	And even Microsoft's kind of guilty of this, too, with the whole XNA thing.
620982	623806	Yeah, that's cool that they showed us that little snippet around...
625667	627529	Game Developers Conference and that kind of time.
627949	630291	But when's it actually coming out?
630631	631431	Not for a while.
632212	633173	So that's kind of lame.
633713	639457	And then with Nintendo and the whole WiiWare service, yeah, they've been teasing that for a long time.
639517	640018	Good point.
640038	641118	I guess it's not just Sony.
641178	643340	It's just easy to pick on Sony for whatever reason.
643560	643940	Well, yeah.
644181	647043	But at least they've given us a date on WiiWare of sorts.
648180	649641	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
672230	672490	DarkSakura.com
699669	701750	Sega Racing Studio has closed.
719537	726224	Quote, the decision is part of a review of Sega's Western Development Studios to ensure that each studio is a profitable entity in its own right.
726584	733511	And unfortunately, the Sega Racing Studios five-year plan would not result in a successful return for the Sega business moving forward.
733971	738235	Or you could probably just look at the sales of Sega Rally Revo because that's the one game they made.
739076	740578	And sadly, I think it was just...
741590	745131	Especially in racing, it's so competitive right now with these next-gen systems.
745151	748392	There are so many racing games out there right now, right?
748452	752213	I mean, look at what they have on these next-gen systems.
753453	759575	Just on the Xbox 360, you had games like Full Auto, Test Drive, Forza, Burnout.
759895	760695	I can go on and on.
761316	761696	Dirt.
762116	763796	Just tons and tons of racing games.
764236	765537	This is just a very competitive market.
766537	769681	So, that's two studios closed in a week.
770062	770382	Sad.
770683	771724	Both racing games.
773487	774267	Yaris was a game?
774407	776228	Yeah, I wouldn't really call it Yaris.
776248	778589	I wouldn't put that quite on the same level as Sega.
778989	780369	But it's just kind of like potential.
780770	781450	You would think potential.
781770	784551	By the way, going back to something we were bringing up a little bit earlier.
784611	788252	I know I'm a little late on this, but the Rob D is a fighting game guru.
788712	792353	And he said the character, Green Guy Throws Cookies, Chang Shin-Zan.
792434	792914	That was it.
793014	793934	I remembered his name.
794254	795094	There it is.
795715	796775	Couldn't remember the full name.
796975	799496	We had a Fatal Fury special at my school.
799696	800936	I never played Chang anyway.
800956	802297	It was all about Kim Kap-Wan.
803493	804995	Actually, I have to agree with you.
805255	807157	It was him and Mai were always the ones I'd use.
807497	808538	And Yuri's butt attack.
809699	810961	She had butt attack, and that was great.
811782	813123	Any character who attacks with her butt.
813483	820270	Except there is a fighting game that has a character that fights with her butt, and the game kind of sucked, and that was the Sailor Moon Super S fighting game.
821732	824375	Which was the first game I've ever imported.
825556	826717	It was a Sailor Moon fighting game.
828324	852920	So, now that we have this little tidbit about me, going back over as far as the rumor mill is concerned, there has been rumored a new Ace Attorney game to be coming out that has been called Gakuten Saiban Perfect Prosecutor and it should be starring Edgeworth.
853641	854201	Objection!
855042	855562	Overruled.
858134	858354	Fumitsu
877372	879073	Apollo Justice is sexy, has connected.
907295	908416	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
926730	931592	Throws them all into a blender, basically, resulting in unique and nostalgic gameplay.
931972	940095	Basically, kind of what you do in this game is that one minute you might be Zelda in a Mario level, and you're trying to stab the asteroids with your sword.
940135	940776	That would be Link.
940836	942456	But then the next minute, well, you know what I mean.
942656	952580	But then the next minute, you're in the asteroids level, and then suddenly you're Pac-Man, and you have to find the dot on the screen to eat the things from Kix that are flying around the screen.
952860	954461	But when you find it, they turn into Blue Ghosts.
955287	956047	Hey, how you doing, Farbs?
977314	978516	Not bad, not bad.
980198	982040	So you're the guy that wrote Rom Check Fail.
982440	983441	Was it a solo effort?
983481	984642	Did you do this all yourself?
984802	985864	Or how did this happen?
987766	988627	Usually I work alone.
989928	990929	It's just easier that way.
990969	995474	Coordinating the project between multiple people is way too hard, especially when you want to do something a bit silly.
996315	997977	How long did it take you to do the whole thing?
999005	1009628	Well, I'm not sure if you saw, but it was part of the video game name generator contest over at Seagate Source, so the whole thing had to be completed within three weeks, which is why it's a pretty small game, but, you know, that's why.
1010168	1012269	Wow, it's very impressive considering it was done in three weeks.
1012289	1014829	I had heard it was, like, the winner.
1014849	1016330	Didn't you end up winning that competition, too?
1017727	1018387	I did, I did.
1019229	1021191	Congratulations, well deserved.
1021772	1026539	How did it get from competition rules to this finished product?
1026839	1030904	Were there certain rules that made you want to go in this direction of developing this game, or what happened?
1032257	1042663	I think you tapped into a little bit of controversy there because the contest had one rule that you had to use this video game name generator website to come up with a name for your game and then make that.
1043024	1044885	And that's something I didn't actually do.
1045585	1047386	Uh-oh, what happened?
1047426	1049307	Did you get a really bad name out of it or something?
1050348	1055971	No, no, what happened was I kind of started in that direction so I started sort of looking at the generator and
1057119	1063701	running it a couple times, coming up with different names, having to think about how it works, and thinking about ways that I could hook in an exciting game with that.
1064762	1075486	And what I saw pretty quickly was that the generator was coming up with a couple of different concepts and just kind of mashing them together, which, if you've played ROM Check File, you'll see is certainly a part of ROM Check File.
1076146	1083509	So anyway, I saw that and I thought, hey, you know what would be awesome is a game that actually generates lots of the games that come out of the generator.
1084860	1085541	Oh, I see.
1086802	1089184	That's pretty cool.
1089204	1092947	It's kind of like you threw all these games in a blender and out comes this.
1092987	1096329	So it wasn't necessarily that you had the idea to begin with.
1096429	1099712	The blending of the names kind of inspired the blended game idea.
1100092	1100713	Yeah, totally.
1101113	1107558	So I was going to do stuff that actually came out of the generator, but I realized, possibly also with the help of some advice from a friend, that...
1108839	1114085	When somebody sees an emu on the screen and there's a dragon flying by, they don't know what that means, right?
1114386	1118310	Whereas if they see Mario and they see some space invaders, they totally get that immediately.
1119934	1122677	The first time I played ROM Check Fail, it took me a minute to get it.
1124938	1131944	But just imagine how much work it would have been if you didn't actually know what the characters were or the ways that they interacted with each other.
1131964	1140071	So not only was it kind of tapping into the whole nostalgia vibe, but it also communicated to the player much more quickly what the hell was going on.
1140931	1148377	I guess that's a very good point because eventually you kind of figure out, okay, if I'm Pac-Man right now, I better eat this dot before I try to touch something or I'm going to be in trouble.
1148818	1148958	So...
1149710	1150870	Yeah, that's right.
1150890	1156772	Whereas if you were a penguin and you had to go pick up a water lily before you could eat things, you would never think of that.
1158712	1161213	Unless I was playing the penguin and water lily game, I don't know.
1162413	1163334	Maybe it would be in the title.
1163734	1171476	Do you think it's that nostalgia is part of the reason why this game has spread like wildfire amongst all the gaming blogs and the internet and caught on?
1171956	1173376	I think that has helped a lot, yeah.
1174497	1177017	Which is a shame, because that's not really what the game was meant to be about.
1177357	1178918	But, you know, I'll take it.
1179918	1181079	What is the game meant to be about?
1181539	1187801	Well, whenever I make a game, I usually think about it just starting with a gameplay concept first, so I think about the way the game's going to play.
1187981	1192102	I don't really think too much about what it looks like or the narrative or anything like that.
1192362	1201946	And this game, like I was saying, was about matching different kind of archetypal characters together, just kind of throwing them in a scene and saying, deal with it.
1204261	1205121	What was the question again?
1205682	1206862	No, that's okay.
1207882	1214965	I guess we were talking about that it's spreading along the blogs and it's kind of like Wildfire and the nostalgia.
1215365	1221247	Is the nostalgia part of why this game you think is caught on so popular?
1222267	1222968	Oh, right, right, right.
1223228	1225449	Yeah, I think that's half of it.
1227328	1233677	You look around, you're going to find a lot of games that take Mario sprites and chuck them in a game or that kind of thing.
1234858	1236420	So it's not unique.
1238002	1242468	What's largely unique is the way that it uses them and the fact that there is a playable game underneath.
1243524	1244004	Absolutely.
1244044	1259593	Did you have to recreate all of the Mario, and I don't know if this might be a controversial thing I'm asking, so you can feel free to say no comment, but did you have to recreate all those sprites and the music and everything, or were you able to kind of, I don't know, I guess, borrow from the games that were already out there?
1259633	1261894	How much of this did you have to kind of build from scratch?
1263475	1263655	Well...
1264560	1267184	Strangely enough, this actually took most of my time.
1267424	1272371	Recreating the gameplay interactions and things was very quick when I was just using a bunch of squares.
1272992	1280023	But once I started looking at the proper sprites from all the games and the sounds and everything, it was a huge process to...
1281331	1282192	to pull it all together.
1282232	1285276	And it came from whatever source I could find first, to be honest.
1285456	1289361	So there's a lot of sprite rip pages that I used, so thanks to everybody who put those together.
1290703	1298793	All the music came from different people's websites where they've sort of reorchestrated tunes, which I then tweaked a little bit to make them sound a little bit more like each other.
1299494	1300875	and cut them up and pasted them together.
1300915	1307058	So I like to think of it as a collaborative effort from the entire internet retro gaming community.
1307138	1311460	I was going to say, I'm thinking this isn't just like a hodgepodge of a game.
1311500	1315723	It's also kind of a mixture of all these different contributions that are already out there on the internet.
1316043	1319725	So some guy who wrote Zelda sprites might have helped with this game and didn't even know it.
1320785	1321146	Yep, yep.
1337640	1341223	Actually, I haven't really got much back from it, which is a bit surprising.
1342544	1352714	I think a lot of people play the game through a direct link, so they don't even see my website, and people who do even pick it up by going through my website don't think to email me, so it's been a bit quiet.
1352774	1356278	I mean, the TIG source feedback threads have been great, but...
1357597	1361400	But unless I've explicitly asked people to talk about my game, it's usually been a bit quiet.
1361980	1362741	Well, that's a damn shame.
1362761	1368045	We need to get some of our listeners to send Farb some love for making this game for free as part of a competition.
1368125	1369526	So listeners, send Farb's a little love.
1369766	1371147	Where's the website they can get in touch with you?
1371787	1375950	Oh, www.farbs.org F-A-R-B-S Excellent.
1375970	1378091	Do you have any future projects you can talk about?
1378131	1379412	Things that might be coming to the website soon?
1379432	1381434	Because you have some other games already on the website too.
1381474	1382675	This isn't the only thing you've ever done.
1382715	1383895	You have some other games as well.
1384336	1388819	But do you have anything in the future you might want to give us some hints about?
1388839	1389679	Uh...
1390740	1394044	I would love to, but unfortunately I'm still deciding what I'm going to do next.
1394084	1403754	I've always got about a dozen ideas kind of floating around, bumping into each other, and it usually takes something to actually push me to put something together as a game.
1403794	1407738	So the VGNG compo was great for me, because I had...
1408879	1411361	Some concept about games that I wanted to make.
1411821	1415204	Suddenly I had a three-week deadline to actually do something, and so I got something done.
1415684	1418846	Whereas now I'm back in that phase of sort of thinking, oh, I don't know what I want to do next.
1418986	1421328	So there will be games coming, I can promise you that.
1422129	1422429	Excellent.
1422449	1423650	But I have no idea which ones.
1424010	1424250	Excellent.
1424270	1429694	Well, here, you know, something we at Orange Laundry have been talking about, our dream game for a long time, you know, I'll just kind of throw it out there.
1429734	1434477	If you can make a game with cats wielding lasers at each other, it might be an amazing game.
1434537	1436619	So just something to think about, maybe for the sequel.
1438220	1442164	Now, something we always ask all of our guests that come on the program because, you know, we're all gamers.
1442524	1444506	What kind of video games have you been playing this week?
1444786	1446168	Have you been playing independent games?
1446308	1447829	Are you a console gamer, PC gamer?
1448070	1449311	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
1450966	1452286	This week's been pretty quiet for me.
1452707	1465390	I've been a bit busy, so I haven't been able to get into any massive titles, so mostly for me it's been just sort of picking up indie titles, because usually you can kind of pick them up, have a bit of a play, and then put them down again, because they're not very large.
1466250	1471011	Other than that, a bit of Smash Bros., a friend of mine imported it, so we were actually able to play it, which is nice.
1471831	1472191	Awesome.
1472231	1472612	Nothing big.
1473112	1473632	Very cool.
1473672	1475812	Do you find yourself drawn to other indie games?
1475912	1478013	Do you like to kind of sample what else is out there in the indie world?
1478496	1485743	Yeah, I'd like to, but like I said, I'm interested in gameplay mechanics, and you're going to see a lot more variation of that kind of stuff in indie games.
1486243	1492209	But also, they're small and disposable, and that's really great when you've got 10 minutes free.
1492989	1495892	It's a lot better than thinking, oh, I've got 10 minutes free, I'm going to start Morrowind.
1495992	1496973	That doesn't add up.
1498434	1499074	Exactly.
1500055	1518025	I got one more question for you, and this might be opening a big can of worms, but it's something we've been kind of talking about a little bit in the past on this program, and that would be kind of the future of console gaming as we see these more independent scene friendly things start to open up, such as XNA and WiiWare and things like that.
1518405	1522628	From your viewpoint as somebody who's been kind of developing independent games, do you think that...
1523388	1528951	XNA and these things that are going to make console development a little more accessible to the indie developer.
1529011	1531873	Do you think this is going to be the next big thing in gaming?
1531893	1537476	Do you think this is going to take off or do you think PC is always where it's really going to be at?
1539090	1546752	Well, I think the XNA thing that they're coming up with where pretty much any game can get distributed is definitely going to be interesting.
1547752	1551213	But in that sense, I think it's just going to really look a lot more like PC.
1553634	1561016	I don't think we're ever going to really hit that kind of wonderland that all indie game developers hope will one day open up where, you know,
1561576	1567862	You can make a game in three months by yourself and push it out on a console and suddenly make millions and millions of dollars.
1568302	1572887	Those opportunities pop up occasionally, but they're extremely rare.
1574368	1574668	I don't know.
1575269	1576350	I think it'll open up a bit more.
1576390	1580414	I think it'll become a little bit more like PC, but I don't think we'll see any major changes.
1581497	1584899	Alright, well, Farbs, thanks so much for joining us all the way from Australia tonight.
1584939	1585959	We really appreciate it.
1586340	1588841	Farbs, he is the man that wrote Rom Check Fail.
1589281	1597525	Check him out, www.farbs.org, and you can download other games as well, not just Rom Check Fail, so check that out.
1597986	1599366	Farbs, thanks so much for being with us tonight.
1600947	1601267	Alright, cheers.
1601608	1602348	Alright, take care.
1604516	1605718	I want to listen to him talk some more.
1606199	1606921	That was really cool.
1607221	1608845	Sorry, he's gone now.
1609085	1609466	I know.
1609787	1611751	But yeah, it's something about accents, isn't there?
1613038	1616039	I want LaserCat.
1616359	1617940	And he's quite talented.
1618060	1618860	I was very surprised.
1619200	1624181	I kind of knew going into that interview that Rom Check Fail was done by pretty much one guy, but that's still very impressive.
1625442	1627842	I'm always impressed by some of the levels of talent out there.
1627862	1631163	Well, best of luck to Farbs, and thanks for taking the time to come on the show.
1631563	1632404	We appreciate it.
1632664	1634144	Are you a big fan of Rom Check Fail, Loki?
1634304	1635805	I think you were the one that showed that to me first.
1635965	1636785	I played it a bit.
1637605	1637965	I don't know.
1638005	1640526	It's one of those games that you can play for just a little bit, and then...
1641386	1642466	Leave it for a while.
1642786	1644747	That was the game that made me go, what is that music?
1644827	1647067	And then I realized it was Marble Madness.
1647227	1649248	It's like WarioWare type of thing.
1649308	1652408	It's one of those things you can just play for a little bit, and it's like total crack and fun.
1652428	1654289	You're like, okay, it's a good micro game.
1654329	1660510	I would like to see one that was just all Nintendo stuff, like Mega Man with Mario, Zelda.
1660590	1662450	Well, he might hit copyright issues with that.
1662770	1663951	Well, I guess he already is.
1663991	1664531	Yeah, who cares?
1665031	1665431	That's true.
1666251	1667712	Make something for WiiWare or something.
1667872	1674016	That's why you need to do it all underground and don't say who you are and just throw it out there on the BitTorrent.
1674096	1676957	Well, I would gather Farbs is probably not his real name.
1677457	1678378	Just speculation.
1678418	1685202	I'm just saying, though, instead of having a website and stuff, because if you do it all underground and stuff like that, they can't really stop you.
1685262	1687503	Especially if you just throw it out there.
1687563	1688824	Just let it catch the current.
1689364	1692225	Alright, well, we want to thank Farbs again for taking the time to come on the show.
1693165	1695546	All the time away from developing new games for us.
1695806	1697326	More crack for us later on.
1697786	1699067	Alright, let's get back into the gaming news.
1699207	1699887	Loki, take it away.
1700287	1708249	Alright, so here's another rumor that's coming around that's not a big surprise, but I'm interested to see that they're actually kind of going this route or...
1708969	1710130	Maybe thinking of going this route.
1711290	1718313	Rumor is that Microsoft, of course, is looking into creating a Wiimote-like device for the Xbox 360.
1719974	1722995	The motion controller is going to be codenamed Newton.
1724035	1728017	And no word on what exactly this might be.
1728717	1736361	Something, though, it will use a USB-powered sensor bar and will possibly have rumble motors as well as...
1738078	1741161	A microphone built in for voice activated games.
1741541	1745946	So it's interesting that they might be going this route.
1746066	1749850	And at the same way, I kind of think, you know, isn't that a little copycat-ish a little bit?
1750270	1753113	But everybody kind of copies everybody at some point.
1753994	1761201	And I know Microsoft has had not great success trying to tap that family market and stuff that Nintendo has, but...
1762113	1763753	Well, seeing it hasn't done bad for them.
1764353	1768914	I mean, even though amongst the hardcore, we kind of all turn our noses at it and go, it's kind of dumb.
1769254	1772095	But apparently it's been doing fairly well for them, so who knows?
1773555	1776436	I don't think as well as, say, Wii Sports or something like that.
1776856	1780116	No, I don't think... You just never know with Microsoft.
1780516	1784757	Microsoft kind of has a way of taking somebody else's idea and kicking it up a notch.
1784837	1785317	You know what I mean?
1785417	1789098	But can you imagine, though, if you will, motion-controlled games with...
1790118	1791139	360's graphics.
1791579	1792779	I mean, that'd be fucking awesome.
1792819	1793119	I don't know.
1793419	1794580	What do you think, DarkSakura?
1794600	1797081	Do you think it could be successful?
1797141	1797901	Motion control on the 360?
1798281	1800162	I opened this up to chat, too.
1800422	1801082	What do you guys think of it?
1801342	1804724	Do you think it could be successful on the 360 or is it going to feel like a cheap knockoff of Wii?
1805844	1814827	I really don't think it would be that difficult to integrate into the 360 because really all you need is just the input device.
1814947	1817909	You need your sensor bar, of course.
1820549	1821790	Oh, there went my power plug again.
1822350	1837362	I don't think that it's going to... I really don't think that it's going to be that sort of cheap knockoff thing, but I think people are going to have a preconceived notion about how it's supposed to work because they have this experience with the Wii.
1838103	1838704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1861340	1863400	VX Jason XV, our fearless webmaster, says Microsoft wants to tap that.
1863420	1864981	Gerardimo says, I want motion control res.
1865081	1868241	Ooh, or if Space Channel 5 does come to Xbox Live Arcade, do want motion control.
1868261	1868342	Choo!
1889622	1889982	Chew.
1890503	1891003	You never know.
1892004	1892624	It'll be interesting.
1894646	1899209	You said that, and I was already starting to think of Samba de Amigo, the one with the posing.
1899329	1900110	Well, they are doing that.
1900230	1900871	I know.
1900891	1903493	That's what I started thinking of with doing your bizarro little poses.
1903933	1907416	Justin says, imagine a game that requires the camera and the motion controller.
1908456	1917743	Good idea, but imagine the highly limited audience that that's going to reach unless Xbox then puts out another bundle that comes with both, which I guess is very possible.
1917864	1918184	I don't know.
1919830	1920150	Who knows?
1921671	1927632	So, we'll continue on with the gaming news, and I want to talk about Metal Gear Solid Online.
1927672	1933214	You know, over here, you had to pre-order the game in order to get the Metal Gear Online demo, but guess what?
1934174	1942537	In the European PlayStation Store, Metal Gear Online Premiere Beta, free download on the PlayStation Store, April 17th to May 6th in Europe.
1943277	1943917	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1965037	1967938	If this were happening in the US, I'd go, hmm, free beta.
1968018	1969159	I'll download it and check it out.
1969299	1974262	I may not be into Metal Gear that much, but hey, if it's free, that gives me incentive to take a look, right?
1974682	1974922	Rob?
1975223	1975403	What?
1975903	1979325	Imagine technical... Imagine babies?
1979845	1980025	No.
1980426	1981786	Imagine not stumbling over your words?
1982067	1984828	Imagine tactical espionage action.
1985349	1986009	Sounds like fun, though.
1987247	1987687	Babies.
1988708	1989168	Babies.
1989248	1989889	With babies.
1990609	1992831	Yes, a tactical espionage baby game.
1993151	1994012	Metal Gear Bailey.
1994652	1995533	Metal Gear Babies.
1996113	1999075	Maybe that'll be, you know, because they have the flash forward in Metal Gear 4.
1999136	2001117	Maybe that'll be a Metal Gear 5 flash backwards.
2001457	2004800	By the way, the beta is running from April 21st to May 6th.
2006241	2010063	Which, by the way, happens to be one day less than we have it in North America.
2010243	2010484	Hmm.
2012090	2012350	DarkSakura.com
2034224	2035185	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2063103	2064146	That's a cool name, Trishalicious.
2064166	2064989	Trishalicious.
2065952	2066654	I hate to say it.
2066895	2070064	I'm going to make us lose a fan, but it does sound like a stripper name.
2072250	2078455	Dear OLR, didn't you hear listening to this show on my iPad?
2078595	2083858	I thought I would ask you about a recent game I purchased and I had to buy it from an online retailer.
2083999	2092164	After reading a review in Game Informer magazine about Pinball Hall of Fame, the Williams Collection, which received a high rating for only being $30, I knew I had to have it.
2092725	2096488	I proceeded to my local gaming shop, expecting them to have the game since it was...
2097228	2101090	Reviewed in their magazine, but nothing was on the shelf or listed in their computer database.
2101571	2105954	When I finally got the game after buying it online, I loaded it up and started playing.
2106494	2111297	PHF on my Wii is the best pinball I have played on a PC or console.
2111817	2116100	I wanted to try to get the word out that this game really kicks major butt as a pinball simulator.
2116900	2118661	I love it, and I want to make sure those...
2119582	2121566	Those who also love pinball to give it a try.
2122067	2126356	Now I want to go play these tables all over again if I can find them at a local arcade.
2126457	2126958	Love to you all.
2127058	2127459	Huggies.
2127659	2128240	Trishulishish.
2130450	2131771	Timbal is awesome.
2132532	2133753	Timbal is the best ever.
2134013	2138877	You know, I downloaded a new table for Timbal FX on Xbox Live this week, the Buccaneer table.
2139137	2139477	Yeah.
2139517	2144641	But I didn't get a chance to play it because I was going to download that Rocky and Bullwinkle table, but I got sidetracked my whole Phantasy Star Universe thing.
2145022	2150866	But Trishalish is not the first person to point out that that's a fun game, but I bet you especially would enjoy that.
2150886	2151247	You got it.
2151287	2152227	You Timbal whore.
2152287	2152548	Really?
2152788	2153108	Yes.
2153568	2154009	Good times?
2154049	2154269	Yes.
2154389	2154689	Yes?
2155049	2155390	All right.
2156390	2160432	How can they release a pinball collection, a Williams pinball collection, and us not have it?
2160812	2162173	Just checking.
2162793	2163253	Okay, then.
2163774	2167095	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
2167135	2167395	What?
2168956	2169857	I was shaking my head.
2170237	2172338	Anyway, next email is...
2173991	2175492	and Commentaries Forever.
2176093	2176733	That's who that is.
2177714	2178975	Hey, OLR, love your show.
2179015	2182498	Been listening for about a month and wondering a few things.
2182919	2185401	Is the ferret still there from your transition to all games?
2187462	2188183	That answer your question?
2189284	2191626	That would make me sad if it were shipped away into a box.
2192667	2197391	I've also heard rumors that Konami will make a DDR 10th anniversary game sometime around this or next year.
2197811	2200353	Could that be plausible due to licensing fees and whatnot?
2200393	2201054	Just want to know.
2202170	2206774	I can see it being plausible since they're probably running out of ideas for new DDR games anyways.
2208055	2210176	Yeah, there's not too much they can do to revise them.
2210196	2214620	So let's put a new DDR game with all the classic Konami songs.
2215760	2217542	Wait, that's like every other DDR game.
2217947	2218668	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2244188	2248335	and, you know, they should do stuff like that, like, uh, third mix have paint mode or something.
2249096	2250979	You know, stuff like, and, and SSR.
2252582	2252862	Whoops.
2254004	2255286	Or you can dance to this song.
2256127	2256688	What, a hoedown?
2256768	2257169	Anyway.
2257700	2258961	That's what I get for leaving things running.
2259521	2266365	Can I... Do you have something to say about... It would not be a first show on all games if I didn't screw up somehow, so there you have it.
2266385	2267866	Do you have something to say about the ditter?
2268126	2278932	Look, I've been saying forever, if DDR wants to evolve, the game needs to be... They need to scrap all their old code, rebuild the game from the ground up, honestly make it look like Guitar Hero at this point.
2279232	2281673	I think that's the best way to make it catch on here in the US.
2281853	2282433	I hate to say it.
2282454	2283794	Or how about... Okay, how about this?
2283814	2286816	You just totally ignore all the tutorials and...
2287677	2289399	Get rid of quest mode.
2290059	2293202	For the love of God, quest mode is crap.
2293903	2294663	Redo quest mode.
2294683	2298387	I think quest mode has potential to be good, but not in its current form.
2298547	2299748	Quest mode is crap.
2299828	2301910	What they need to have, bring challenge mode back.
2302010	2302731	That's fine.
2302831	2308035	The challenge modes, I think, are a lot more fun or challenging than quest mode.
2308055	2309797	Quest mode is like, okay, play a lot of songs, go.
2311073	2311973	Oh, fun!
2312433	2313674	Nothing like repetition.
2314474	2318094	I just think if they want the DDR to continue, they should, you know, remake.
2318134	2318815	I've said it for years.
2318835	2322015	They need to make DDR, take it from being cooperative and making competitive.
2322675	2323216	But that's just me.
2323896	2332177	Or have, like, new modifiers that are song-specific that, like, certain things happen in the song and maybe integrate it with, like, you know, videos or something that I'm playing.
2332197	2334578	Like, the arrows fall down different ways or something like that.
2335198	2336318	I mean, which would be pretty cool.
2336358	2338119	Like, different themes.
2338139	2339419	Alright.
2339779	2340139	Next email.
2340842	2345086	Next email is... As soon as it loads up.
2347147	2348969	Next email comes to us from Harvey.
2350650	2351110	Oh, sorry.
2351631	2353773	It comes to us from a poorly formatted email.
2355194	2360118	Okay, I'm just going to say Harvey was the last name because they put their full name in there, so that's what I'm going to say.
2360979	2362140	Hey, what's up, OLR?
2362260	2368925	I was wondering what do you think about Sony saying DualShock wouldn't fit in a 6-axis controller and now it's there?
2369065	2369786	How ironic.
2370626	2372467	They didn't ever say it wouldn't fit.
2372547	2375769	They couldn't do it at the same time with the tilt sensor.
2375789	2377990	And it's so last gen.
2378070	2379371	It's actually the same shell.
2379431	2382533	In fact, there's actually spots for the two Rumble motors.
2383793	2384974	That's bullshit.
2385614	2390757	Do you think that redesigning the PSN store will affect the amount of content that is bought?
2391418	2394820	Will you guys be buying any games from the new WiiWare section next month?
2395000	2397181	Also, did Live365 give DarkSakura a cookie?
2398536	2401177	I will make it one of my goals as a gamer to give her a cookie.
2403538	2406299	Dude, cookies are great, but you have to get it to me by next weekend.
2407060	2408120	Because it's your birthday.
2408180	2408780	It's my birthday.
2409080	2409541	That's right.
2409641	2410661	I'm eating whatever I want to.
2411762	2412302	Lots of cookies.
2413122	2413522	And booze.
2414423	2415823	Life 35 did not give you a cookie.
2415843	2416984	In fact, they gave me a migraine.
2419725	2419885	Yeah.
2421738	2425243	I want to... They owe me a cookie and then they owe Rob money.
2425564	2426946	As far as WiiWare, yes.
2427106	2434778	I'm hoping there's some movies or something, gameplay videos that make its way to the US sites so I can learn a little more about these games than just having to take a leap of faith.
2435419	2435840	You know what I mean?
2435860	2436461	Strong bad game.
2436621	2437802	Just like, well, yeah, okay.
2437962	2440205	Maybe there's certain cases where I would take a leap of faith.
2440485	2443909	And like, I already know I want that Dr. Mario game, especially if it has like the online and everything.
2443949	2451196	But, you know, with some of those other ones, like even like Final Fantasy, I'm kind of like, honestly, I don't know if I have the room on my Wii hard drive to fit that stuff.
2451216	2453078	You know how many freaking virtual console games I have?
2453098	2454600	A sad amount.
2455120	2455701	Sad amount.
2456682	2456842	Wow.
2458308	2462070	This person has listed gamer goals, and I have to read some of these because I have to respond to some of them.
2462170	2462430	Okay.
2462770	2463470	Gamer goals?
2463690	2464431	Yes, there's 15 goals.
2464511	2465911	Are you going to read them all?
2465951	2467032	The list is not in order.
2467272	2467352	Oh.
2468212	2471834	One, be a guest on Attack of the Show either in person or webcam viewer.
2472034	2472394	Why?
2473334	2473795	Overrated.
2474195	2475856	Be a guest on X-Play in person.
2476396	2476816	Why?
2477196	2477656	Overrated.
2478137	2480678	They don't have guests anymore on X-Play.
2480938	2485940	Oh, well, I guess they don't have viewers anymore, I guess, on live viewers.
2486952	2494242	Special guest on a gamer podcast, OLR, Gamer Tag Radio, All Games Radio, IGN, EGM, OXM, GameScoop, Beyond, or Three Red Lights.
2494702	2495243	All of those?
2496405	2497026	That might be tricky.
2497694	2499575	Come to... Yeah, getting on OLR is easy.
2499635	2500535	Yeah, just show up.
2501135	2502956	Or, you know, call us on the Skype line.
2503016	2504076	It's very easy to get on the show.
2504756	2506337	Same thing with All Games Interactive, at least.
2506377	2509397	They do... Their phones are open the whole time.
2509517	2510338	I don't know how they do it.
2510698	2512278	Because they keep their phones open the whole show.
2512318	2514779	If we did that, we'd get derailed even faster than we already do.
2515219	2517720	But, you know, they have their phones open all day.
2517740	2520081	We've been on that show and it's very tangent-y too.
2520641	2521081	But it's fun.
2521301	2521481	Yes.
2522321	2523502	Four, go to E3.
2524102	2525062	You don't want to go there anymore.
2526525	2526725	I do.
2527526	2528086	Speak for yourself.
2528246	2532588	Well, I want to, but I don't think that E3 is not what it was.
2533448	2534509	So, just to let you know.
2534749	2535229	Yeah, okay.
2535269	2537230	Miss got invited last year and didn't go.
2539591	2540571	I had other things to do.
2541532	2543073	Have a game room in my future home.
2543333	2544413	That's always a good idea.
2544893	2547515	Battle it out over Major League Gaming.
2547855	2549275	Battle it out at Major League Gaming.
2549656	2549876	Okay.
2550376	2551917	Get my degree in video game design.
2552377	2554338	This is one of the ones I wanted to talk about.
2555546	2556827	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2575282	2578284	Some folks in chat room are commenting on this whole E3 thing.
2579905	2583008	And Gerardimo said, I want to be a guest on X-Play four years ago.
2583568	2586650	Justin says, E3 is lame sauce now.
2586710	2587611	It's all about PAX.
2588472	2590413	Oh, God, I hope I get to go to PAX this year.
2590493	2591274	I think I'm going to go.
2591674	2592094	I want to go.
2592214	2597338	I think there's supposed to be like a big all games thing, like a Voltron thing happening at PAX.
2597358	2597638	I want to go.
2597658	2598359	So I definitely want to go.
2598799	2599480	I know, it's going to be hot.
2599500	2599860	I want to go.
2601241	2602241	What was the other thing I want to see?
2605743	2609544	Recruit number 0745 says E3 was cool before they fucked it over.
2610105	2612586	By the way, ask someone how to change your nick so we can give you your proper name.
2613166	2617268	BlackWolf says last year's E3 was the best E3 I went to and I've been to 11 of them.
2619349	2620349	Lucky you, Bobby Black.
2620390	2625172	I think that the whole point, though, is that this person might not... Dude, since we're on all games now, are we going to get into the E3 this year?
2626032	2626732	Freaking hope so.
2627313	2628053	I'll write an article.
2628193	2628573	Yeah, I know.
2628914	2629534	We'll write articles.
2630424	2630984	I'm a good writer.
2632164	2633985	Anyway, make a video game.
2634005	2635925	Well, you'll need your design creds then.
2637325	2639206	Review another company's video game.
2639426	2641006	You could do that if you got a blog.
2641766	2644387	Travel to Japan and meet the people at Konami and Square Enix.
2644907	2645207	Okay.
2645907	2653029	Go to New York and hang out with True Homie, The Rage 65, Scariest Globe, Retro King, Grow White Boy, and others.
2653109	2654889	They are some of my friends on Xbox Live.
2655529	2658490	Get my Xbox 360 autographed by the guys over at Orange Lounge Radio.
2659030	2659650	We could do that.
2662758	2663819	I need me a new Xbox 360.
2664019	2666260	And we still have to finish the faceplates.
2666300	2668241	Several people have asked about the faceplates now.
2668641	2673323	I'm almost feeling like, oh God, we're going to have to come up with some way to do this for everybody who wants one.
2673963	2676704	Or at least get autographed pictures or something.
2676724	2678325	I never thought we'd be at that level.
2678385	2679565	I want a picture of me.
2681466	2682227	Outro Music
2701580	2703401	Ah, well.
2703661	2704542	We'll figure out how to do it.
2704562	2712526	I had somebody email my personal email that once won, and, you know, Osfer was the guy that kind of started it, and we will figure something out within the next couple weeks, I promise.
2713467	2714448	So, the last three?
2714788	2714988	Yes.
2715448	2722092	Get a copy of Gears of War 1 and 2, autographed by Cliffy B. Attend the University of Advanced Technology, and give Dark Sakura a cookie.
2723889	2730754	Those are some... You would be fulfilling the being on a show, on a podcast, and the giving me a cookie one at the same time.
2731434	2733536	And even the signature, the autographed Xbox.
2733556	2735137	Yeah, I will autograph before you're here in the studio.
2735357	2736658	I know, we're awesome.
2736738	2737839	Well, here's the thing.
2738259	2739480	Where's this guy live, did he say?
2739720	2739940	No.
2740381	2741602	If you live near PAX...
2742242	2743203	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2765682	2769725	Anyway, last email is, thanks for switching to All Games Radio.
2770066	2772327	I couldn't even listen to you live on Live 365.
2772748	2775730	Anyway, I'm happy you switched seamlessly, but down to business.
2776270	2780894	I want to ask you guys, are you actually going to air the fuck show and when?
2782415	2784757	Looking forward to it, thanks for your time, Zeppelins.
2784997	2786258	Oh yeah, remember that?
2786378	2787459	We were supposed to do the fuck show.
2789794	2792756	I don't know if that's actually going to happen next week.
2792796	2794797	Because I'm going to be out of town most of the weekend.
2796179	2797740	We can't say when it's going to happen.
2797780	2799561	We've got to pick a show and not tell anyone.
2799581	2800662	See, I like that idea.
2801042	2803284	It should just fucking happen whenever the fuck it is.
2804985	2806146	The fuck show will happen.
2806546	2809449	It won't happen next week, but it'll happen before summer.
2809469	2811570	Is that fair?
2811690	2815994	Yeah, we have to have one listener in on it just because they have to keep tally, but...
2817074	2822696	We'll tell Dark Tetsuya or somebody who's been listening forever that we know is going to do a good job keeping tally.
2822756	2833639	If you don't know what the fuck show is and you didn't listen to last week's show, it's this completely idiotic and stupid idea we had that is so funny it makes us giggle in only places that whattheyplay.com snap can.
2836813	2839195	By the way, how much do I love the wiki editors?
2840216	2845281	The people that work on our wiki, which is at orangeloungeradio.wiki.com, how much do I love them?
2845321	2853308	Especially, namely, and a lot of people are getting in on it now, but namely, AJ Mix and Dark Tetsuya have been doing probably about 80% of the work, if not a little more.
2853808	2854249	I love this.
2854769	2855570	Here's the summary.
2855610	2859213	You go into the page that says Dream Games, right?
2860234	2862536	and let's see, they're all accounted for.
2863256	2884028	Skye's Voice the Game, LaserCats, Loki's World of Randomness, Rice Princess Presents Boobies and Pandas, Forbidden Bomberman, Pen and Paper, Furries, and then Cosplayers vs. Furries, and then here's the new entry, WhatTheyPlay.com Snap, a Nintendo Wii game involving taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck.
2887690	2888551	Oh, that's beautiful.
2889107	2889707	Beautiful!
2889908	2894171	A gold star for AJ Mix, who made that edit.
2894651	2900535	Someone else emailed something that I'm actually not going to really talk much about because I can't watch it while we're live.
2901055	2902957	Someone sent me an Engineer's Guide to Cats.
2905589	2906690	Just the thought of an engineer.
2906710	2907530	That could be morbid.
2908271	2914015	I think I'm just going... Well, especially since Dan was showing Julie that South Park episode last night about sniffing cat butts.
2915656	2918478	And so that just sort of makes me think of that.
2918538	2922541	I'll watch it later, but thank you, whoever sent me an engineer's guide to cats.
2924863	2925243	And that's it.
2926164	2926424	All right.
2926464	2931127	If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to go.
2932348	2934910	Speaking of pen and paper, the game, Loki...
2936829	2939530	Yes, speaking of pen and paper, the game.
2940031	2945854	Now, the game that we're referring to, of course, is LOL, Never Party Alone.
2945974	2949455	It's a multiplayer-only game put out by H-Tech.
2949596	2953137	It's actually kind of like Pictionary, sort of.
2953598	2961702	You basically draw that will give you, I guess, a theme or a statement or something.
2962102	2965724	Like, draw a funny clown, and then you have to draw a clown or something like that.
2966544	2969985	and, you know, everybody draws it, then one person votes on it.
2970005	2974947	So it's like, I guess, Pictionary meets Apples to Apples, and then the winner gets a point.
2975447	2981950	But the thing is, as we said with Pen and Paper, the game, you can do this on Pen and Paper already, and you don't need to buy a game.
2982310	2993834	Well, unfortunately, you won't be able to buy this game in stores, because according to the game's distributor, Agetech, it will be available online only.
2994714	2997695	So, yeah, you won't find this in stores.
2999296	2999796	That's alright.
3000016	3001897	Buy a tablet of paper and pens instead.
3005339	3007420	Is it surprising?
3007480	3008800	What if you're playing it in a store?
3010781	3011662	Then it will be in a store.
3012542	3013783	You can't buy it in a store, though.
3013903	3017204	What if you were downloading it while you were in the store and paying the money while you were in that store?
3017884	3018885	No, it's not downloadable.
3019045	3023307	It's just that you're buying... You have to buy it from their online store.
3023697	3027818	What if you have your laptop and you're at a store?
3028318	3029679	Okay, I'm picky.
3030639	3031219	Just forget it.
3031239	3032239	Do you really need this game?
3032279	3035160	I mean, it's not like... What else did they sell online only?
3035220	3036020	Electroplankton?
3037080	3038101	I like Electroplankton.
3038321	3040901	I know, but that was a game that was worth buying online.
3041381	3041782	LOL?
3042002	3042482	I don't know.
3043362	3044202	I don't know about that one.
3044322	3047903	You know what the alternative to LOL is?
3049003	3051344	It's called Open Canvas...
3052525	3053625	PicktoChat.
3055466	3073070	Well, guys, we're going to get into another segment we do here on Orange Lounge Radio once in a while, and I kind of gave away what's coming earlier based on the music, but... That's right, when you hear that happy music, you know something really fucked up happened, and it's probably time to give out another OLR stupid award.
3074131	3074731	This time...
3076048	3093501	18-year-old Jean-Pierre Orlewicz He is on trial right now for first-degree premeditated murder.
3093921	3095302	Guess what him and his friend did?
3097103	3101266	They ambushed 26-year-old Daniel Sorensen in November.
3101406	3104728	They stabbed him in the back and then sawed off his head and burned his body.
3105569	3106589	This was not a video game.
3106629	3107390	This was real life.
3107570	3109370	It is not funny when it happens in real life.
3109690	3111751	It's not as offensive as two guys kissing, though.
3113792	3114292	Don't even.
3115032	3116973	Oh my god, this guy looks psychotic.
3117153	3117993	I know, seriously.
3118093	3121214	Okay, so the trial is going on right now, but here it is.
3121554	3122474	Here's what happened.
3122914	3126255	The defense is blaming Hitman.
3126936	3127816	That's right, Hitman.
3128840	3130582	Here it is from a CNN report.
3131283	3134826	They dealt with it a video game called Hitman that he used to watch.
3135166	3138209	And it was a video game where you got impressions that you would kill somebody.
3138510	3141593	Hit them from their backside where they were not aware they were being killed.
3143495	3149020	But, I don't know, that sounds a little more like Manhunt to me, but... Regardless, this guy's an idiot!
3150109	3151150	Not just for what he did.
3151190	3152451	I mean, that was stupid anyway.
3152551	3158635	But for the fact that the defense... And I guess the defense team wins the stupid award too, but trying to blame it on Hitman.
3159835	3161176	I mean, come on.
3162437	3166019	I mean, it's one thing to stab somebody and kill them that way.
3166720	3168921	But, like, that's insane.
3169502	3176666	Like, on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being, like, not really fucked up and 10 being, like, super fucked up, like, stabbing someone and killing them is at least a 12, okay?
3176746	3177767	That's beyond fucked up.
3178127	3178948	But stabbing them...
3179608	3182589	Then cutting off their head, then burning their body?
3183129	3185930	That's like $11 billion on that scale, okay?
3186410	3192793	So, you've got issues, and you need to go away for a long time, where we won't see you ever, ever again.
3193773	3196114	And don't try to blame it on a video game, ass.
3200735	3202036	Stories like this make me angsty.
3203956	3209540	You know what happens, usually after the Stupid Award comes a bout of angst, and we like to call that here our FUs of the Week.
3223729	3226191	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight with the FUs of the Week.
3227451	3230514	Okay, my FU of the Week goes towards...
3234642	3245795	People who drive really, really slow, like grandma slow, when you're going the speed limit and they're going less than the speed limit.
3245855	3250320	And I know I talk about bad drivers all the time, but oh my god, all of them were in front of me today.
3251101	3253924	And also, an FU goes towards...
3256750	3260594	The amounts of cleaning I've done in the past week in our house.
3261035	3262816	But I did get something really awesome.
3262876	3263577	I have a toy.
3263737	3265699	I call it the doctor's cleaning tool.
3266320	3267241	It's called a sonic scrubber.
3269702	3293497	and you use it for cars and I used it for the bathroom instead but anyway all of the dust that got kicked up from all the cleaning I've done for Dan's pinball gathering tonight has had my eyes bloodshot like all week so F you to dust too Loki, do you have any FUs of the week?
3294697	3298501	F you goes to this chair that I'm sitting on because it's horribly uncomfortable.
3299602	3302625	We will try to find a cheap chair for you at Ikea or something, I promise.
3302645	3303946	Ikea has comfy plastic ones.
3304006	3305227	I want to get another chair like that.
3305267	3306648	That chair is awesome, the one you sit in.
3306668	3310372	I know they can't see it on just TV because you're secretive, but it's a very nice chair.
3311573	3311953	Sorry, Loki.
3311973	3312314	Is that it?
3313428	3317313	F you to my pancreas, which continues to bother me.
3317333	3318594	I've been having chest pains today.
3318935	3320757	Although thankfully I've been getting a little bit better.
3320817	3323680	And speaking of food, I actually ate a full meal last night.
3323700	3324221	It was very nice.
3324241	3324962	I went to Mimi's.
3325632	3327793	and they have a low-fat menu.
3328313	3333854	And they have a spaghetti marinara dish that was actually pretty damn good for low-fat, but I'm so sick of this low-fat diet.
3334175	3339936	I mean, granted, it's nice to have lost 25 pounds and all, but I am so sick of eating low-fat.
3339956	3344838	Like, seriously, when Loki brought in that pizza tonight, I'm like, I would kill you for a slice of pizza.
3345138	3345378	Rob.
3345718	3345898	What?
3346849	3347109	All right.
3347129	3347269	Anyhow.
3374505	3376666	Enough about food, because I'm getting hungry, because I haven't eaten dinner yet.
3377006	3382109	That will conclude the FUs of the week, and we'll get back into the show with some more gaming news.
3382929	3386471	Well, we've already known that the U.S.
3386751	3396716	and North America are going to be getting a, I guess, limited edition Metal Gear Solid bundle with the game, of course, an 80 gig system, and...
3398857	3401819	Also, I guess, the DualShock 3 controller.
3402219	3404960	Well, now, there's also another bundle coming.
3405020	3408342	That's going to be the Gunmetal Grey PlayStation 3.
3409303	3423230	In fact, it was confirmed by Konami's Brandon Loreno on the official PlayStation blog that this very, very limited edition system will be available in North America as part of a special Metal Gear 4 bundle.
3423590	3427933	So, I guess it's the same thing, but this one's Gunmetal Silver Grey-ish.
3430818	3437433	And so I guess both these are going to be scheduled to arrive around the game's release date of June 12th.
3440161	3442262	Good luck getting your gunmetal gray one.
3442282	3444163	They're going to be super rare, basically?
3444323	3445963	Yeah, super rare.
3446063	3450705	I bet I know something that's even more rare, and I know I can say something about this now, because Bobby said it on his show tonight.
3450745	3452065	I can talk about this a little bit.
3453106	3460689	All Games Radio, which we're a part of, is going to be giving away, this is super duper rare, an Xbox 360 Grand Theft Auto 4.
3461949	3463070	Box, okay?
3463190	3465552	There's only like 500 of these puppies in existence.
3465972	3467894	All games got one, and they're giving it away.
3469495	3471296	And they're not giving it to you, Loki, I'm sorry to say.
3471737	3472397	You're ineligible.
3472437	3473258	Stupid Rockstar.
3473298	3481404	Listen, okay, I played more of Grand Theft Auto's PSP multiplayer, and trust me, that's pretty painful, okay?
3481484	3489631	That game had some pretty bad multiplayer, but I loved it, and we played it more than anybody, any human on the face of this earth.
3490592	3490892	And yet...
3491598	3493108	You know, no love for me.
3493511	3493994	What the hell.
3494773	3496735	Well, here's the way it works on All Games Radio.
3496935	3501178	Every show that's on the network gets to pick a finalist, basically.
3501198	3503180	It gets to do a contest to pick a finalist.
3503220	3506683	So we'll be picking our finalist either next week or the week after.
3506703	3509965	But if you don't win with us, you might be able to win with Bobby Blackwolf.
3509985	3516370	You might be able to win All Games Interactive, Video Game Outsiders, Platform Nation.
3516390	3522075	Countless other shows that All Games Radio has, every show is going to send one finalist to a last round.
3522115	3523336	And I don't know what they're going to do at that point.
3523456	3524997	I gave one the freaking Mark Echo.
3525037	3525978	I mean, come on, man.
3525998	3527779	They're just like throwing them away now.
3527859	3528780	So, stay tuned.
3528800	3530001	Next week we'll have more details.
3530041	3531642	We may even do the qualifier next week.
3531682	3532763	I'll post more on the website.
3532843	3534745	I just, I have to know the all games timetable.
3534765	3536066	Either it'll be next week or in two weeks.
3536666	3537427	So, we'll see.
3538648	3539328	Okay, back to the news.
3539909	3544452	Yes, news, because ferrets are always relevant to my interests.
3545573	3548955	Something else that's relevant to my interests is the BBC and the Wii.
3549516	3551878	And they rhyme, because the BBC on the Wii is cool.
3552895	3553396	Wee!
3553716	3561905	Anyway, so there is an iPlayer replay service that the BBC has that's going to be functional on the Wii.
3562586	3564107	And the service is one that...
3566115	3580004	It's actually already available on iPod Touch and iPhone that will do limited by time different replays of BBC shows, including Doctor Who, Torchwood, which are two of my favorites, and whatever else they want.
3581164	3584627	It's for Wii owners in the UK.
3584727	3587548	I actually want to try this on my iPhone.
3587588	3588369	I would love to try it.
3589129	3597853	Um, but if anyone wants to actually see what's, um, what's playing on there, the address is bbc.co.uk slash iPlayer.
3597873	3600154	And you can see what they've got up for now.
3601015	3601835	That's pretty sweet.
3602295	3604436	I was reading this concept a little bit earlier for the show started.
3604456	3607097	I'm like, this is, this is a great next step for the Wii.
3607398	3611259	I mean, talking about wanting to be like, you know, a centerpiece in the living room with its news and forecast.
3611299	3613520	I mean, talk about being able to bring television shows like that.
3613901	3616642	I mean, even more so the next, like, what if you didn't have to pay for it?
3618236	3627566	One thing that I do want to mention that might be a problem is that the BBC's website does IP check.
3628266	3633652	For example, when the Sarah Jane Adventures were just coming out, you actually couldn't even look at their website.
3633772	3634993	It would block it completely.
3636034	3639296	and I even used two different IP directors and it still had me blocked.
3640037	3651565	But just for what's on there right now as far as featured items is actually the last episode of Doctor Who that aired the other day which was called Pompeii the Last Day.
3652285	3661372	There's also Nadodai, Open House, To Buy or Not to Buy, Freaky Eaters, Dateline London.
3662252	3663393	Yeah, if you care.
3663413	3664013	Yeah.
3665234	3666275	There's some pretty good stuff on there.
3666315	3666695	Love Soup.
3667656	3669057	I would watch a lot of BBC shows.
3669097	3670878	I kind of secretly hope they'd bring it over here.
3670898	3672059	Watch some Little Britain.
3672359	3674921	A show that my husband likes is Top Gear.
3676002	3677503	He watches episodes of that on YouTube.
3678383	3680104	But Top Gear is also available for that.
3680364	3683827	If you're a big racing or car fanatic, that's a good show.
3685891	3697121	Alright, well we'll see Well this is kind of interesting It's been, I don't know, maybe leaked out on when Animal Crossing for the Wii will be coming out
3698527	3698667	Yay!
3698707	3699768	Could be.
3725580	3730845	But, I mean, you know, last game that came out was on the DS, and that was around November, December-ish.
3730985	3734027	So, you know, it could be just a coincidence that it's coming out.
3734087	3739672	I'd be interested to see what's on the other months, you know, just to see if that kind of... That's the thing I was kind of missing.
3739752	3740593	What's in the other months?
3740693	3743355	Were some of the earlier games from this year in the earlier months?
3743415	3745597	Like, did you have, you know, Smash Bros.
3745637	3747419	Brawl in March or February?
3748239	3752043	Like Professor Layton or something for February and...
3752643	3755165	It is a bit of a stretch, but we'll see.
3755725	3759467	Well, we are about to wind down here, and we'll be taking Skype calls very soon.
3759507	3765211	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3765271	3767953	Keep in mind that is different from the other All Games shows.
3768313	3775937	For those of you guys that are new to our show tonight, thanks to our new relationship with AllGames.com, keep in mind we do have a different phone number than the rest of their shows that are live.
3776198	3778039	Sorry, I'm going to interrupt real quick.
3778079	3778259	Mm-hmm.
3778839	3806627	They actually have someone actually has the calendar and it sounds like it may just be a coincidence because January was Mario Galaxy February was Wii Fit but this is all stuff that's Japanese dates so I don't know March was Mario Party They had April's Mario Kart May looks like they had like Yoshi's Island June something Metroid Prime related July Kirby
3807387	3808448	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3833160	3838442	Did you know that Cookin' Mama Cook-Off is the 98th top-selling game in the past 12 months?
3838482	3841043	470k units moved between North America and Europe.
3841603	3842043	Pretty cool.
3842523	3845444	That's a lot, even though the game was kind of crap compared to the DS.
3845524	3848085	Like, it lost a lot of magic on its way to the Wii.
3848185	3848985	Kind of interesting.
3849005	3850146	You're still supposed to lend me yours.
3850973	3852074	You can take it anytime.
3852134	3853875	I'm not that excited about it.
3854195	3857258	I'm just quickly looking through the list to see if there's anything else notable on it.
3857518	3859920	I noticed Boogie is in at number 87.
3860960	3862382	I don't know how I felt about Boogie.
3862442	3863542	It was a little bit corny.
3864537	3864817	Halo 3?
3886260	3890261	Halo 3, Mario Galaxy Super Mario Galaxy Assassin's Creed Pokemon Diamond and Pearl
3909288	3912011	6 was Need for Speed Pro Street, $5.4 million.
3912751	3915894	5 was Madden NFL 08, $5.7 million.
3916694	3921298	4 was FIFA Soccer 08, because remember we brought Europe into the mix, so you know a soccer game is going to sell.
3921798	3922879	$5.7 million as well.
3923360	3928464	Number 3, this surprised me, Guitar Hero 3 was the number 3 selling game of the past 12 months.
3928484	3930325	That doesn't surprise me.
3930365	3933007	Just because it's so much more expensive, $7.5 million units.
3934929	3936030	Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare 8.3 million units
3960963	3965645	It's weird, though, because here on Orange Launch Radio, that's not the type of game we usually talk about.
3965665	3967185	It's just not the type of thing we play.
3967545	3968786	I even said that I liked it.
3968966	3970746	Yeah, we still have respect for it, certainly.
3970766	3971227	No, it's weird.
3971307	3973487	Imagine Fashion Designer is number 66.
3974287	3975068	Oh, my God.
3975508	3977148	You know what game's not on this list?
3977208	3977829	Imagine Babies?
3978249	3978629	No.
3978769	3978969	What?
3979649	3980329	Eye of Judgment.
3980349	3982110	Eye of Judgment is not on the list.
3982130	3982850	That is correct.
3984291	3984971	Good job, Loki.
3985031	3987071	I did notice some PS3 titles in there.
3987111	3988632	I saw Ratchet and Clank in there somewhere.
3989679	3992100	So, well, there you have it.
3992841	3994802	One more story, then we're going to open up that Skype line.
3994902	3996563	And I don't know how it's going to run tonight.
3996583	4000505	It might be kind of choppy because we have both Justin.TV and this higher bitrate streaming.
4000905	4004867	I will have to can Justin.TV during this segment if we have problems, just so you know.
4004927	4006768	We got one more story, and it's a sweet one, right, Jamie?
4007313	4010615	Yeah, it's really sweet and sappy and makes my teeth hurt.
4010955	4011816	But it's really cool.
4012736	4018279	There is a guy, and let me make sure that I pronounce his name correctly, Brian Klima, I guess?
4018339	4018659	Klima?
4019080	4019820	K-L-I-M-A?
4021041	4025923	Who, by his own account, made a custom level in...
4027720	4050062	Super Smash Brothers Brawl that says marry me and put the timer to infinite put Peach, Mario, and Kirby who was his intended fiance's favorite character and just left the TV on so when she came home and turned on the TV she's like oh you were in the middle of the game and then she saw that he had the ring in hand and he said look at the TV again and she said yes so I thought it was sweet
4050582	4052184	Tell the all-games crowd.
4075987	4078092	Your engagement over a particular movie.
4078874	4079897	I love this story.
4080766	4086668	Dan and I, we had known each other online for quite a while.
4086728	4091590	And when I moved out here, on Valentine's Day, we were watching UHF.
4092410	4093511	We were kind of broke.
4093531	4094311	I didn't have a job.
4094391	4097272	And he was working telemarketing somewhere.
4097632	4108816	But we were watching UHF and eating French baguettes and spinach dip and drinking the kosher blackberry wine.
4109471	4110872	I love how you remember every detail.
4110932	4111993	It's so girly but cute.
4112093	4112893	Oh, shut up.
4113233	4114994	I remember lots of details about lots of stuff.
4115815	4119517	And we just sort of mutually decided to get married.
4120278	4121258	I was like, we should get married.
4121518	4122139	Okay, when?
4122679	4123159	Sometime?
4123520	4123780	Okay.
4125261	4127762	I just think the fact you got married over UHF is so funny.
4127882	4128903	Weird Al brought us together.
4128923	4130784	It's time to drink from the fire hose!
4131625	4132585	Yay!
4132605	4134526	You found the marble in the oatmeal!
4136707	4138207	You should have had that at your wedding.
4138588	4139368	The fire hose.
4139748	4142809	We didn't actually have a wedding.
4143449	4147891	Yeah, but at your, you know, you should have at least, you know, outside the courthouse.
4147971	4153812	I wore a black corset and a purple skirt and boots when I got married.
4154113	4154733	That's awesome.
4155593	4157654	And then I had cake and it was good.
4158254	4161455	And then we went home and I slept in the next day.
4163092	4180027	Romantic Odd1 in chat says, God, if I had a nickel for every time I got laid because of UHF You'd owe money Yeah, DJ Morpheus follows up with a zinger, you'd owe five bucks What's that old saying, great minds think like me?
4180808	4181568	No, Dan says it.
4181588	4182348	Great minds think like us.
4182528	4182808	Alright.
4183548	4184809	Skype line's open.
4184829	4187909	1-877-GAME-OLR Again, I apologize.
4187929	4189049	This is a little bit experimental.
4189069	4190630	We'll see how this first call works out.
4190710	4192150	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4192430	4192850	Who's this?
4195130	4195831	It's GS68.
4196271	4197451	Hello, GS68.
4197471	4198491	What is on your mind, my friend?
4200491	4204172	Um, I have a question for Loki about Arikard Lee.
4204672	4205492	Alright, what's up, Loki?
4206292	4207773	Or what's up, GS68, for Loki?
4209913	4210013	Um,
4210814	4211954	Have you played online yet?
4213275	4213475	Yes.
4217877	4225240	How is the online, like, if someone disconnects, will they get replaced by CPU without you knowing, like in Brawl?
4226520	4236124	I don't think anyone disconnected in the ones that I played, but you can choose between matches or whatever to leave or continue on to another race or something like that.
4238140	4238701	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4257323	4275410	I'd assume they would lose points because the way the rankings work, you start off with 5,000 points when you first start playing and then depending on where you place within the 12, you'll lose up to like 64 points and then gain maybe 64 points.
4276270	4279972	So I'd imagine if they disconnected, whatever it put them in last.
4282053	4282573	Sorry, go ahead.
4285038	4287039	Um, Caram's saying that they can't hear me.
4287059	4288680	I have the mic turned all the way up.
4288820	4290201	You were a little quiet, but that's okay.
4290221	4291042	It might be on our end.
4291062	4291682	Just keep talking.
4291722	4292142	Don't listen.
4292302	4293703	Don't let them bully you in chat.
4296005	4300327	Well, anyway, that's what turns me off from playing Super Smash Bros.
4300407	4302228	Online with anyone mode.
4302708	4303329	Because if...
4304170	4305611	The game will disconnect you.
4305631	4308894	The game will replace the disconnector with a CPU and not tell you.
4309334	4311015	What's the point of playing online anymore?
4311035	4314237	I mean, I guess we'll just play against three CPU characters.
4314478	4319381	Honestly, GS68, there really wasn't one, and I think they just put it in as an afterthought to say they did it.
4319681	4320482	That's my honest answer.
4320722	4324065	Because it sounds like Mario Kart Wii has a much more robust type of online.
4324105	4325846	I didn't even know it had that whole ranking.
4325926	4326947	It has leaderboards.
4327007	4332351	It has a bunch of stuff, and you can look at your friends and see where they are at different times and stuff.
4333132	4338906	You can download the top rankers, their ghost data, and race it if you want to.
4340169	4342574	But not all that stuff works too well right now because of...
4343651	4347652	They're getting hammered, so trying to download ghost data didn't work for me.
4348292	4350013	I tried a few times and it didn't work.
4350073	4353334	In fact, I had to hammer online to finally get into a game.
4354094	4357515	It took me about 10 tries and I finally got to play an online game.
4358535	4363496	That'll get fixed eventually, I'm sure, but right now it's just getting hammered pretty bad.
4366157	4366917	Any other comments, GS68?
4366937	4367177	Or questions?
4372114	4372735	DMN DMN DMN
4395891	4421546	I'll be honest, it's very similar to the type of thing you've probably seen on GameFAQs in the past But it wasn't with characters, it was with games And he was trying to find the best game of all time Of which Super Metroid ended up winning last week For which I got called every name in the book Because it was separated by one vote Yes, even amongst all the chatters, all the hosts in studio Of which we had quite a few guests last week It was separated by one vote And I cast the deciding vote to make Super Metroid win over Chrono Trigger And I took a lot of shit for it
4422827	4427549	But yeah, we did not actually send in a qualifier list because DMN closed it off early.
4427889	4429190	But what would you want to ask about that?
4431511	4432052	Yeah.
4432072	4437835	I would like to ask our listeners what games they wish they had nominated.
4439736	4447220	I mean, some games that are very big were on the brackets.
4447300	4447460	I mean,
4449847	4456995	So basically, the kind of thing like, you know, what was missing, what should have been there, what wasn't on the brackets that should have been.
4457035	4466446	I think, honestly, the sampling was a pretty good sampling of the mainstream best games that there were out there.
4466506	4470090	I think, honestly, you would be diving into everyone's niche gaming.
4470931	4472352	to see what it is they missed.
4472392	4476374	You know, if you're an RPG fan, you probably said, oh, where was Grandia?
4476474	4478375	Or where was, you know, some niche RPG?
4478715	4485018	If you're a racing game fan, you were probably like, oh, where was, you know, Burnout or whatever it is, so.
4485719	4499886	Well, I mean, I'm surprised to see that, like, obscure games like Massive Twin Allegiance are in the brackets, yet a game like Castle Venus, which did so much for the Castle Venus series, it basically took
4501951	4509587	They combined 2D action, adventure, gameplay, and RPG elements That game was not on there
4510618	4512359	Yeah, Castlevania is one of my favorite games too.
4532465	4532785	We'll see.
4533046	4546275	It's going to be interesting, though, because if we were to do something all-encompassing of all games, you take a show like All Games Interactive, and a lot of those folks are really into the sports titles and the Call of Duties and the things we don't give enough time to on this show.
4546595	4551358	So I think it would be very interesting to bring those two worlds together and see what still comes out on top.
4551798	4552459	We'll see what happens.
4552719	4556021	GS68, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls in, but thanks so much for the phone call, buddy.
4556041	4556622	All right, take care.
4556642	4556942	All right.
4558052	4560293	All right, we're going to take some more calls.
4560313	4561114	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4561174	4563155	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4563195	4564355	But looky, looky, we got a call.
4564415	4565436	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4565456	4565796	Who's this?
4569898	4570839	I think we got lag issues.
4571139	4573200	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
4576322	4577242	Okay, call dropped.
4577322	4577803	That sucks.
4578023	4578463	Try it again.
4578503	4579644	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4579664	4580044	Who's this?
4583615	4585656	This is Mr. VXJasonXV.
4609819	4611100	Alright, we'll give it one more try.
4611180	4614781	If you want to give us a call here on Orange Lounge Radio, the lines are open now.
4614901	4617422	That last call didn't go so well, so we'll have to edit that out.
4617883	4619143	But we're taking more calls.
4619243	4619944	Let's go to this call.
4619984	4620984	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4621004	4621384	Who's this?
4627947	4629408	Did everybody drop their mics on the ground?
4629568	4629968	Hello?
4629988	4631689	It's Zaku.
4632109	4632969	Yes, I'm here.
4633289	4633850	Hi, Zaku.
4633870	4634530	What's on your mind?
4637198	4643650	Nothing much, just trying to congratulate you on your new home and everything now.
4644130	4645092	Our fresh digs.
4645273	4647096	Nice of you to actually hold something for us at the house.
4647614	4648014	It's awesome.
4648034	4648395	You know what?
4648435	4649035	I got to say this.
4649055	4651697	I want to say this real quick, Zaku.
4651737	4653638	I really want to thank everybody who's tuning in tonight.
4654098	4661143	Both Bobby Blackwolf before us and us, we have exceeded more live listeners than we've ever had.
4661944	4662184	Ever.
4662864	4664865	With the exception of E3 specials we've done.
4664885	4666006	We've brought in more people.
4666086	4669048	But who knew the Voltron of podcasting would work?
4669148	4671130	Both Bobby and us are benefiting from this.
4671490	4671970	Think about it.
4672150	4673191	You guys are meant for each other.
4675402	4676543	I mean, think about it.
4676903	4684308	I mean, it was... I'm surprised you guys didn't do it soon enough and dislike 365, you know, probably like a year, you know, a year earlier.
4684348	4686830	I mean... Yeah, hindsight's always 20-20, isn't it?
4687130	4688051	Look, you got a question?
4688751	4689432	What's on your mind?
4690433	4698498	Uh, basically... Alright, since I managed to get a PSP last Friday and managed to get it hacked, I need some good, you know, some good apps.
4698818	4703982	Loki, I mean, you... I know you gotta help me out with a little bit or something.
4704918	4708000	What else can I put on my PSP in terms of homebrew?
4708820	4709160	What now?
4709380	4709760	I'm sorry.
4711061	4712402	I couldn't understand him.
4714002	4716984	I just turned down the bandwidth on JustinTV, so hopefully it'll get a little better.
4717484	4719465	He wants to know PSP apps he should have.
4719885	4720185	I don't know.
4720205	4721786	I haven't downloaded anything in a long time.
4722206	4726088	I guess emulators, that's kind of cool, but PSP radio maybe.
4729250	4729670	I don't know.
4730570	4732952	I haven't really downloaded any homebrew.
4735074	4743719	I know, Zaku, you should get the PSP radio thing and the latest firmware, and you can listen to all games radio now on the PSP radio anywhere you go.
4745420	4748262	Yeah, I already got the latest firmware hacked.
4748362	4749283	I already got that one.
4749903	4754806	Actually, Zaku, you reminded me of something, and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but did you see this?
4755466	4756427	Loki, I'm curious if you saw this.
4756487	4761830	Sony sent out a poll earlier this week basically asking people, why do you hack the PSP?
4762311	4763091	Yeah, that's what I heard.
4763131	4766455	I hack my PSP to give it features that the PSP doesn't otherwise I hack my PSP to steal games Oh man, that's so true
4785211	4787073	I hack it just to spite you.
4787893	4790295	How about a couple good websites, Zach, who can keep an eye on?
4790335	4792497	Because really it's about what you want to do with the PSP.
4792537	4794279	So how about a couple good websites for Zach?
4794319	4802466	I guess psbhacks.com, psbupdates.qj.net, stuff like that.
4802646	4804808	I mean, those would be two websites I'd check.
4805408	4807170	They have a lot of downloads on there and stuff.
4808050	4808331	Right.
4809351	4813375	I just barely had trouble today just getting some proper emulators, you know.
4814281	4819222	But, you know, at least I know people, you know, like you, Loki, and other folks that can, you know, help me out.
4819942	4820402	That's good.
4820542	4821942	You gotta get back on that scene.
4822122	4825603	I mean, latest M33 is pretty damn good right now.
4826283	4827863	Especially when your PSP's overclocked.
4829144	4831224	Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls.
4831284	4832144	Any quick final thoughts?
4833284	4835145	Um, get your PSP hacked.
4835185	4838685	Don't leave, you know, fuck Sony's hindrance.
4839565	4839826	Alright.
4839846	4842286	Just know somebody went up in door, but battery, that's all you need to know.
4843018	4843358	All right.
4843858	4844719	It's all about the battery.
4844839	4845439	Take care, buddy.
4845459	4847680	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4847700	4853042	I'm hoping our next call will be a little better with the bandwidth because I drop Justin TV a lot in the video.
4853062	4855103	They're probably just seeing a still picture in there right now.
4855783	4856883	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4856903	4857243	Who's this?
4858244	4858624	Hi, guys.
4858644	4859464	This is Footy Monster.
4859504	4860485	See, that's a lot quicker.
4861565	4865046	Footy Monster is in Argentina, so we might just have to do that every week on Justin TV.
4865487	4866047	Anyway, sorry.
4866087	4867827	We're learning about our show live.
4867867	4869068	What's on your mind, Footy Monster?
4869773	4870313	No worries at all.
4870954	4872895	I just wanted to share a couple of things real quick.
4872935	4874997	First off, congrats on your new home.
4875377	4875697	Thank you.
4875737	4876238	We like it.
4876498	4880461	Hey, quick, DarkSakura, put some of the nice silverware here from all games in your purse.
4881401	4881721	Okay.
4884383	4884704	All right.
4884744	4884944	Sorry.
4884984	4885284	What's up?
4886545	4890588	Well, you know that story you had earlier about Brazil and the whole bully thing?
4891528	4892689	Yes, I do.
4892789	4894210	Well, here's the thing.
4894390	4896692	As far as I understand, since it's pretty close from here,
4897256	4904821	The only country that I know in South America that has any sort of official distribution of anything is actually Chile, and they have Microsoft.
4904921	4908523	Like, Sony doesn't release anything officially, and Nintendo doesn't release anything officially.
4909044	4913507	Argentina used to have official distribution of Nintendo products, but that was like in 1995.
4914607	4925415	So, I'm thinking, and this is just a theory, that anything that happens in Brazil, Rockstar will never care for, because it's not that they're sending their game to Brazil.
4926240	4927242	because they are not doing it.
4927282	4931950	It's just retailers importing the game and having a grey market, so to speak.
4933266	4942909	Um, you know what's interesting though is that it's interesting that Nintendo doesn't support South America more because like I was just kind of noticing, I was just looking at some of the box art on a recent game.
4943249	4954232	Drew was here last week and he gave me back Super Paper Mario because he borrowed it and I was just kind of eyeing the back of the box and kind of noticing how like it's interesting how Nintendo puts the back of their boxes in three different languages all at once now.
4954532	4958773	Like you look at the back of a box of a Nintendo game, it's in English, French, and Spanish all in the back.
4959093	4960455	But you read some of the fine print.
4960515	4961496	Yes, I was very bored.
4961956	4970106	It talks about how the game is only for distribution in the United States, Canada, hence the French, and Latin America, they say, hence the Spanish.
4970126	4974931	Yeah, but Latin America is like Puerto Rico, which is basically the US, and Mexico, which is basically the US.
4975731	4986436	Well, I think some of our Mexican listeners might disagree, but at the same time, I do find it interesting because then they're basically saying, well, Latin America is just Mexico.
4986856	4991659	It is kind of interesting that they are cutting off the rest of the countries south of Mexico.
4991839	4993019	Well, no, not really.
4993139	4996641	I mean, considering the economies that we have here, it's not that surprising.
4996681	5000002	I mean, over here, what you have to spend to play a game.
5000042	5002864	I mean, I was just the other day at the shop buying a 360 game.
5003649	5006330	Well, attempting to, and it was like 90 US dollars.
5006850	5014652	So, I'm not gonna go buy a game for that price, so if Nintendo had to officially release their games, support the region, who do you think the prices of games are gonna be?
5015933	5016193	You know?
5016513	5020974	And they, I mean, they're not gonna sell at what people here could buy, because they would have no profit.
5021294	5025615	And even worse, you know, people from the US would import from South America, I mean, it's the same thing, right?
5026096	5026876	And pay cheaper.
5026896	5027656	True, true.
5028018	5028558	It would never work.
5028899	5029559	I guess that's true.
5030760	5032481	I guess we had to get the realist perspective.
5032921	5035563	So in the meantime, how are you getting your games, Footy?
5035623	5036444	Remind our listeners.
5036504	5037304	How do you get your games?
5037324	5039866	Do you just have to pay the markup or do you import or what?
5040426	5041587	Actually, I got a 360 quite recently.
5044009	5059945	I had the option of flashing the BIOS like Loki does in one of his 360s and pirate my games but I actually really liked the live experience and I actually bit the bullet and whenever I got to Chile games there are pretty...
5060626	5063309	They're not cheap, but they're competitive prices with the US.
5063669	5068614	As in, I could buy Mass Effect for $50, or the other day I found Lost Odyssey for $45.
5069535	5072579	So, you know, it's like the prices are even, sometimes they're even cheaper.
5072619	5075362	Like, it got DOA 4 new, sealed, for $20.
5076282	5083430	So, what I did is just actually go there because I have family there, and whenever I make a trip, I just bring two or three games with me.
5084068	5101026	because here it's like $100 but over there since Microsoft officially distributes the games it's totally possible to actually buy original games so right now I'm buying original games and just doing it on PS2 I had to buy backups that's all you could do and on my DS I do the same thing
5101579	5110763	It's very interesting, Footy, to hear you kind of talking openly about pirating games, which, you know, has ruffled some feathers in the past here on this show with some of our listeners who are against pirating, which, you know, I understand.
5112284	5113164	Let me make this straight.
5113244	5114644	I do not condone piracy.
5115845	5119346	But it's interesting, though, Footy, when it's your only option, you know, like you're talking about.
5119386	5122008	I mean, it's that or smuggle your games from Chile.
5122668	5127810	Or not play games because, really, I mean, just because you don't have money, your option is not stealing, you know.
5128604	5133433	I do it because I am fully aware that I'm doing something that's not entirely legal or morally correct.
5134274	5137681	This is a small anecdote here.
5138032	5151517	When I was a kid, I used to go to a computer shop to get my computer games in floppy disks, and I would go with my floppy disk that I would buy in a box at a retailer, go there, and look through a list of games and ask them for a game, and I would pay them, and I would go home.
5151817	5154058	To me, that was totally normal and reasonable.
5154098	5155419	That was how you got games.
5155879	5158900	Only later, I understood that that's illegal.
5159520	5160961	But that was the way you did it here.
5162441	5164542	So there's another culture of original games here.
5164802	5166083	I mean, really, there isn't.
5167065	5195690	so that's part of the problem as well piracy is just so rampant you know that it's like the way it is it's like go to China and say you know with the same argument it will not work I guess it's so interesting to hear from around the world kind of the way things work because sometimes we're in our little bubbles in these other countries we live in so what I love about the internet and doing these podcasts and talking to people from around the world is you get to hear you get to hear from gamers everywhere Footy we got to wrap up and let you go but anything else you want to say to our listeners that's pretty much it guys I guess I'll talk to you later all right good luck Footy take care you too
5197606	5198947	Smuggles his games from Chile.
5199307	5199727	Amazing.
5201508	5202489	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5202529	5202889	Who's this?
5206531	5210693	You sound millions light years better.
5210773	5211794	Hello, Jason.
5212014	5214215	I know, you sound telephony, probably because he's on the telephone.
5214235	5215756	He's on the 877, but that's all right.
5215976	5216657	Yeah, yeah.
5216957	5217877	I blame Skype.
5217957	5218758	I blame Vista.
5218798	5222800	I blame ComCrap and, you know, everything else I can blame.
5222840	5223400	It's not my fault.
5223420	5223961	Life is just five.
5223981	5224681	Don't forget to blame them.
5226134	5230077	and the RAA.
5230597	5231178	And the police.
5232359	5233359	Jason, what's on your mind?
5235861	5237462	Two short things and one quick thing.
5238643	5239384	And one longer thing.
5240144	5243126	Did you know that they made an Impossible Mission remake on the Wii?
5244067	5245128	Yes, in Europe.
5245288	5245828	Where is it?
5246108	5246349	Here.
5246809	5247229	I want it.
5247309	5249311	Gimme, gimme, gimme.
5250311	5251632	On my video game shelf.
5252193	5253574	Come over and play it sometime.
5253894	5254234	Shut up.
5254274	5255395	Did you import it from Europe?
5256565	5263188	No, it was in the, we went to Best Buy, we were checking out, and it was just sitting in those discount bins.
5263549	5263889	What?
5263989	5267651	I looked at it, I laughed, I said, I'm getting this, and did, and I've already played it.
5268271	5270572	Then the game must have come out here, under the radar.
5270912	5277295	I, yeah, it doesn't have any, it's obviously not Pal, it works on our TV without anything special.
5277696	5278836	You don't use Freeload or any of that stuff, right?
5278876	5280597	I didn't look down at the specific branding, but.
5281564	5284046	Well, shit, I'm going to go pick that up tomorrow then.
5284446	5285127	All right, cool.
5285207	5285887	Thanks for the heads up.
5287209	5288410	I didn't even know it came out here.
5288490	5288950	That's great.
5289070	5289671	It's because it didn't.
5289971	5290411	It did?
5290791	5291332	It did not.
5291512	5292533	It only came out on the DS.
5293454	5295735	Yeah, Impossible Mission DS, $10 on Amazon.
5296956	5301519	I will go look at the box.
5301779	5302879	I'll look for more logos.
5303020	5305061	I will take a picture and show you guys.
5305081	5306061	I would do it, but it'll...
5320049	5322390	I completely forgot what the second thing is, so I'll just skip to the last thing.
5322410	5323270	Farbs is exceedingly intelligent.
5323290	5323510	Yes, he is.
5347023	5357391	I was obviously listening to the interview, since I made it back in time to be able to listen to the show, and the discussion along the lines of XNA and WiiWare and everything opening up new opportunities.
5358072	5372163	It's opening up another avenue for developers of the sort to showcase their talent, but it's not going to be a... It's going to be the same thing with indie and underground games that we already have through a different medium.
5373438	5383927	It's, you know, the ones that are really good, they will be that one game and then the talent from the studio or just a specific individual is going to be hired onto a big name studio and the cycle is going to continue.
5384688	5393035	It's a great new avenue, absolutely, but it's not going to fundamentally change the landscape of indie games being easily accessible and open to everybody.
5393596	5397099	And it was just very interesting to hear somebody else
5397492	5398193	I mean, go figure.
5398233	5403276	A developer especially, which is very interesting to hear him say the exact same thoughts that I would have on such a thing.
5403596	5405658	It's a great thing, but it doesn't change the landscape.
5407324	5410546	And plus the fact that, you know, he's in another country, too.
5410626	5416390	So you kind of get, you know, that whole thing I was just talking about with FootyMonster, hearing from gamers around the world, hearing it's still the same idea over there.
5416450	5420573	Not that there's, you know, obviously all the companies are in Australia doing business.
5420853	5424215	It's not that radically different from what it is over here in Europe or what have you.
5424576	5428318	But still interesting that it all comes to that kind of same thought.
5428999	5429479	I don't know.
5429579	5433822	Maybe I blew the X and A thing out of proportion a little bit when we first heard about it on the show.
5433862	5437144	But I still think it's going to be a pretty radical, you know,
5437584	5444408	It's just like YouTube didn't change the internet completely, but it had a great impact that was felt.
5444568	5445268	You know what I mean?
5445648	5446889	People know what YouTube is.
5446909	5450831	I honestly think XNA is going to be a YouTube of sorts for gaming.
5451591	5452452	That's kind of how I feel.
5453632	5457254	Did you play those little community XNA two-week trial games that they had up there?
5457274	5458194	Yeah, some of them were fun.
5459335	5460355	Yes, yes, that they were.
5460916	5461036	It's...
5461835	5462876	I guess that's true.
5485800	5486180	and many more.
5506171	5508513	were yards better than Yaris.
5508973	5509473	You know what I mean?
5509533	5511614	They were miles above Yaris.
5511795	5514656	And some of the other, you know, there's been some other junk on Xbox.
5514716	5517918	I hate to say it, but the Tron ports weren't all that great.
5518038	5518999	Like, they could have done better.
5519039	5521080	And some of the other classic game ports, you know what I mean?
5523001	5526083	I just think, you know, put it in the hands of the developers, it'd be interesting.
5527352	5534683	These new games can certainly hold a candle to classic remakes and shit like yours.
5535204	5538769	Jason, we gotta wrap up here so we can sign off for the night.
5538809	5540752	It's already midnight 30 on the East Coast.
5541353	5543276	Do you have any quick final thoughts for us?
5544985	5547088	I wish I knew what all I wanted to say, but I forgot.
5547168	5547808	So, good night.
5548169	5549310	Well, you can always call us next week.
5549791	5550091	Good night.
5550491	5550892	Absolutely.
5551332	5551653	Bye.
5552233	5554996	Our fearless webmaster, VXJasonXV.
5555357	5556278	We love him here on the program.
5556298	5557639	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
5557659	5558640	Sorry to those who didn't get through.
5558660	5560002	We can always try again next week.
5561103	5564246	We're going to wrap up the show, but first we've got to get to some last minute news.
5564266	5566609	I'm going to check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute news.
5568521	5571803	Not really much, but it's kind of interesting.
5571823	5581009	It looks like there's a hacking group, Blaze Team, that has released a hacked Wii Virtual Console game that they've broken the encryption on.
5581169	5587393	So that's a whole big old can of worms that Nintendo probably doesn't want opened.
5589815	5592377	And then there's some other interesting things.
5594741	5595602	Castle Crashers.
5595662	5601145	It looks like it's going to have some new characters, including a bear that fights with a fish.
5602266	5608510	And you also, I guess, get little, I don't know, helper pets or something like that.
5608530	5609711	And they have a floating cat.
5610832	5611432	It's kind of funny.
5611753	5612933	I can't wait for this game to come out.
5615475	5616276	A floating cat?
5616696	5618037	Yeah, it's an animal orb.
5618097	5620939	It's the cat who will add to your agility and strength.
5623000	5623521	Interesting.
5625083	5626543	I don't know, it's cute.
5627524	5632585	RawSteelUT says the ESRB.org lists impossible mission for DS, PS2, PSP, and Wii.
5633305	5634085	I gotta go look for that.
5634765	5638826	They have, yeah, Scratchpaw is the cat, which is a cute name for a cat.
5638866	5640327	Scratchpaw, that is kind of cute.
5641387	5644268	They also have, there's some other pictures in here.
5644308	5646148	They have like a little bird and a dog.
5647394	5649795	and I don't know.
5650215	5659057	It's just all on devblog.thebehemoth.com and you can check out like they show off the different weapons and stuff.
5659777	5672540	Was it Barbarian Axe, Fish, they have a Thin Sword, Skinny Sword, Thick Sword, Pumpkin Peeler and different characters for Castle Crashers.
5673120	5675701	Looks like, well, the Bear and
5676221	5678263	and then Periwinkle Knight.
5680764	5685247	And, you know, other than... Man, they're going to have a lot of characters to play as.
5685527	5687048	That game's going to be fucking awesome.
5687709	5688149	Can't wait.
5691091	5691731	That's really it.
5692832	5695754	Didn't we talk about games for Windows magazines going online only?
5696374	5697115	Yeah, I think so.
5698376	5698656	It is.
5699096	5700997	It's kind of the way magazines are going right now anyway.
5701758	5702298	Sad to say.
5702318	5702879	That's...
5703607	5704488	We're going to wrap up.
5704768	5707450	We're running pretty long tonight on our first all-game show, but that's all right.
5707470	5708050	We had a good time.
5708371	5710052	We had Farbs on the show.
5710132	5710793	We had lots of folks.
5710813	5711653	Let's go around to GearBase.
5711713	5712214	Final thought.
5712554	5713575	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5714475	5715056	It's hot in here.
5715997	5716697	It's getting cooler.
5716737	5717978	It's cooling down as the night goes on.
5718699	5719739	Loki, your final thought.
5720120	5721401	It's hot and humid in here.
5722502	5724723	My final thought is you guys are babies.
5725244	5726525	It's not that bad in here.
5726625	5727866	No, it is getting pretty bad.
5727906	5729247	Hopefully we get an AC next week.
5729507	5730107	And, and, and?
5730428	5730548	And?
5731438	5733801	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5747154	5747974	for our live listeners.
5748014	5748955	So we'll show that in a little bit.
5749615	5751555	But for those guys listening to the podcast, it's over.

5783147	5783988	Don't forget the fuck show.
