487	19074	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19943	22784	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April 6th of 2008.
23804	28906	We are live here on our stream for the last time on Live 365.
28946	30627	This is the last piece of live programming.
30887	36309	But for you people that download and listen to our podcast every week faithfully, not a darn thing is going to change for you.
36589	40711	But we do invite you all to come on and listen to a live show, participate in the chat room.
41011	45853	The new place to do it will be www.allgames.com starting on Sunday the 13th.
47122	54986	But meanwhile, we still have some of this week's news to take care of, so let's kick off this week's news for Part B with Loki.
56187	65812	So it's no surprise, with DualShock 3 being released here any time now, that they're going to be pulling the plug on the 6-axis.
66473	72616	Basically throwing motors in those old 6-axis controllers that they have lying around and putting a new shell on it.
74361	78845	So yeah, if you're looking for a rumble-less controller, you're going to be out of luck.
79325	90876	However, though, if you want to get with the times and actually have a controller with that last-gen rumble technology in there, then feel free to head to the store probably now and go pick one up.
94339	95760	Rostelia T says, That sucks.
95860	96941	I like the six-axis.
97221	100284	That comment from chat.orangelongeradio.com So...
101919	102399	What do you think?
102479	104600	I mean, good thing or bad thing about this?
104640	108240	I think it just kind of sucks because it's going to cost so much money to replace now.
108300	110941	But I guess new console owners won't really care.
110961	115462	I kind of anticipated this was going to happen, so I already sold back two of my controllers.
116302	119182	And so I just have two more now that I just have to replace.
119882	125803	But the thing is, though, now I think you're going to be fucked if you try to trade them in like GameStop or something like that because no one's going to want them.
125883	127524	The value has gone down big time on that.
127544	127984	That's true.
128024	129684	No future games are going to support them, right?
130376	130916	No, they will.
131116	133197	It just won't have Rumble, probably.
134477	135617	The Rumble will be disabled.
136018	136398	Gotcha.
137318	139458	Well, that's not the only thing Sony is doing.
139538	145000	Sony is shutting down the PS2 and PSP gaming servers for some of the online games.
145600	148141	Some games are no longer going to work after June 30th.
148181	149141	Now, here's the weird thing.
149561	153402	One of the games on the list is Amplitude, but I thought that game already went down.
154082	156563	So, some of these games, I think, are already gone.
156994	161255	JackX, Lemmings, PS2, MyStreet, Syphon, Filter, OmegaStrain, TwistedMetalBlackOnline, Everybody's Golf, PSP, Lemmings, WorldTourSoccer2
183274	184094	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
210677	213258	But Twisted Metal Black Online kind of sucks, though.
213318	215199	There's no offline mode for that.
216179	216559	I don't know.
217640	217980	Whatever.
218060	220061	All right, well, those servers are bye-bye.
222442	228684	I wonder if somehow old news didn't leak through as new news this week, and we're getting fooled, too, because I swear that Amplitude thing is like a year old.
228704	230325	No, it's supposed to happen on June 30th.
231385	231966	All right.
232226	237308	PSP, I've never heard a PSP game shutting their server down, so that element's new for sure, so.
238174	239635	Maybe some wires got crossed, I don't know.
239655	242236	Maybe it was Frequency that was getting shut down last time.
242276	243477	No, Frequency was never online.
244878	245878	I miss Amplitude, though.
245898	246699	That was a great game.
246739	247740	I wish they'd make a sequel.
248200	251222	I wish that my computer wasn't being messed up right now.
251882	252142	Uh-oh.
253243	254563	Are you having problems connecting to the network?
256024	256725	Okay, there it is.
257365	266170	For some reason, what happens is that, and this is just with my crappy laptop, is that I'll have several different Firefox windows open, and then one of them will suddenly vanish.
267191	267451	Fun.
267471	267531	Fun.
267878	268358	Cagney, Davis, Eastwood
296969	300012	I guess, so far that just looks like it's alphabetical, so whatever.
301053	303635	If there's one called Cagney, there has to be one called Lacey, come on.
303775	305317	That'll be when they get to L. Okay.
306137	310241	So they're saying that these patches are going to be coming out over the year.
312323	313904	Well, that's good, they're going to keep the game fresh.
313944	319329	And that's one of those games I played a lot for two days, and I'm just kind of collecting dust right now, which is too bad.
321031	321131	Um...
322000	322500	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
352569	354249	I finished Saints Row, so that's awesome.
354389	354850	Someday, right?
355230	356490	Yeah.
356810	357770	So, let's see.
357830	358931	Some other cool stuff.
358951	361331	I don't know.
361571	363532	This may be cool if you're into Gran Turismo.
364092	369533	Or if you have, perhaps, I don't know, a younger sibling that you're trying to get into Gran Turismo.
370093	375154	Apparently, there's a game that they were talking about a while back called Gran Turismo for Boys.
375614	377695	It was going to be a kid-friendly game for kids.
378427	379508	Grand Turismo 5, The Standalone Game
403872	417606	and of course when they were first announcing Gran Turismo 4 Boys it was revealed in November 2004 by Yakumuchi and kind of the way the hook pre-teens on cars I guess kind of like Hot Wheels or something.
420028	421290	How exactly do you do that?
421310	424092	I mean, is it just that the cars are a little more silly, or what?
424252	425493	I don't know if it's a little more silly.
425553	427775	Maybe, like, easier to tune, or something like that.
427835	429797	Maybe they walk them through on how to tune the cars.
429877	430797	I need that mode.
430877	432959	I can't do all that stuff in those games.
433039	440625	It's too much... That's why those types of games like Gran Turismo 4s aren't really for me, because there's too much of that car shop stuff that I'm not really into.
441086	442467	You know, not like Crazy Taxi.
442507	444849	Just push the pedal and go, and try to drive into people.
445309	446070	Have you seen that new game?
446090	448152	It's supposed to be coming out in a couple weeks.
448452	448512	Uh,
449079	451080	Emergency Mayhem, Emergency Vehicles
476822	477243	I don't know.
477785	478568	Maybe you can do that.
478929	480775	Throw the body into the dumpster.
480935	482320	I would throw my passenger in the fire.
482621	483363	That would be fun.
484640	485621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
509760	513804	And so they're saying, the team at MadDoc Software is extremely talented.
514204	521991	Bringing them within the Rockstar Games family will enhance our core technology and further support our commitment to creating progressive and innovative gaming experiences.
522111	523792	So, another merger.
524373	526314	That's the sound of the corporate suck-up.
526675	530078	And the last game they worked on was the Bully Scholarship Edition.
530118	531779	So, port.
533200	535002	And a broken one at that.
535305	538508	Gotcha, so it could be that more games are going to get ported.
538528	542891	Maybe that Grand Theft Auto on DS isn't so incorrect.
542911	545233	Hey, I'm down for Grand Theft Auto game on DS.
545293	547135	Did you see that rumor about it earlier this week?
547215	548235	I think it's a misprint.
548476	549216	Yeah, I do too.
549717	553920	I mean, something like that, they couldn't really put Grand Theft Auto 4 on the DS.
554200	555842	Unless it was top-down, which would be pretty cool.
556242	556382	Hmm.
558832	563473	Alright, so now we're going to get into another segment here on the program and we like to do this every week.
563513	566054	And this segment isn't going away or changing at all.
566434	573415	We still continue to ask you guys to email us every week with whatever feedback you have for the program.
573435	573676	We do?
574356	574996	Yes, we do.
575416	575976	Like it or not.
576176	576456	Okay.
576796	579537	Alright, and we call it our mailbag.
579877	584058	So if you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send them.
584417	588760	DarkSakura dives into the mailbag every week and picks out a few of her favorite emails to read here on the air.
589121	591142	And that's what you do, because you're going to do it right now.
591502	591823	Or else.
592503	593624	Or else you go in that dumpster.
594084	594565	No.
595605	596066	Fire.
597567	600209	So, he knows Rob doesn't sing the intro for me anymore.
600749	601049	Anyway.
601430	603231	Maybe on all games I will.
603391	603671	Maybe.
604672	605773	On the fuck show I will.
606958	610701	He didn't sing the mailbag intro, I thought it was very... That was the Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
610741	614343	Yeah, it was Let's Ask Orange Lounge, which we haven't done in a long time.
614363	615144	Why don't we?
615364	617826	We should do one... For our Skype segment, let it be that.
618486	619547	You mean no Skype calls tonight?
619587	622349	No, let them call in on Skype, but have it be Ask Orange Lounge.
622369	624010	But they get to ask a question and that's it.
624150	625691	If they do anything else, we hang up on them.
625752	626112	That's it.
626392	627753	Okay, I love that idea.
628373	630955	So tonight's Skype segment is Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
631195	632837	You call in, ask a question, that's it.
632877	634738	You try to deviate the call, we hang up on you.
635543	639826	I was wondering what your thoughts are on crappy MMOs, such as RuneScape, or that's pretty much the only crappy MMO I've played.
661534	662475	Well, it's not that bad.
662515	666576	It's just full of grinding, so I guess the true question of mine is, what are your thoughts on RuneScape?
666937	667597	I've never played it.
668497	672779	Also, whenever I see, let's have tea screen name, I always think it says, let's shave tea.
674080	674961	But that doesn't matter.
675301	676501	How would you shave tea?
677282	680323	Tea leaves, maybe you shave them with a razor.
680483	681384	You and your logic.
683204	686946	So keep up the great work, SkyDarkSakura and Loki, and I can't wait for the next podcast.
687386	688007	And that's from...
689665	690765	Someone who didn't put their name on here.
690905	691946	So it's for person.
693086	697087	RuneScape, the only thing about it, I'm looking at some articles about it on Wikipedia.
697167	698788	It looks a little dated to me.
698968	702349	I've never played it, but it's free, and free is always a good thing.
702429	704690	No, free is not always a good thing.
705150	705610	I guess that's true.
705630	706250	There was Yaris.
706590	706971	Yaris.
706991	708171	But this looks better than Yaris.
708231	710172	At least you can customize your equipment.
710192	711192	The characters look kind of funny.
712472	715673	Apparently there's 150 different RuneScape servers throughout the world.
715813	716334	It started in 2003.
718231	719132	No, no, I might have to check it out.
719152	719712	It might be fun.
720092	721093	It's RuneScape.
721293	722094	Fuck RuneScape.
722534	723274	Why fuck RuneScape?
723294	724675	Okay, so you obviously know this game.
724975	725996	What do you think of RuneScape?
726356	727497	You get what you pay for.
728698	729959	Why don't you like it?
731199	737804	It's slow, it's clunky, it's a grind fest, and it has one of the worst communities I have ever seen in a game, ever.
738064	740045	And it looks like it's set in the universe of Paperboy.
741586	743687	Based on that screenshot, it does a little bit, huh?
744328	745909	Paperboy the MMO, that's pretty rad.
745949	746649	That would be awesome.
746709	747390	I'd play it.
747550	747830	All right.
748397	750237	and then you go to the Crystal Castles and you're done.
750417	750677	Anyway.
750858	751338	Next email!
751778	752098	Okay!
753318	754018	Jeez, Rob.
754118	754478	Jeez.
755258	755498	Okay.
756679	758359	I like ordering the next email.
758459	759419	I think I'm going to do that from now on.
759439	760519	I'm going to order the emails.
760759	762740	Yeah, watch me shove this ferret up your ass.
764300	764440	Ew.
764960	766441	This comes from... No, I love the ferret.
766461	767341	I wouldn't do that to the ferret.
767621	767821	Anyway.
767841	770481	It's a new segment.
770701	773702	I can't think of an introduction to my email except for holy crap.
774625	776306	I'm a bit scared about what happened to Rob.
776326	778628	I hope you feel better and that it wasn't anything too serious.
780449	781390	Well, I feel better.
782030	790456	If you want to do something for me, just cross your fingers, cross your toes, pray if that's what you're into or what have you.
790476	792377	And sacrifice chickens to your god.
792437	795559	Light a candle or something that it doesn't come back and that it goes away.
795599	801623	Because honestly, that's the most scary thing about it is that I still have a little bit of those pains and I'm hoping it's just on its way out.
802593	804574	Don't worry, Rob.
804634	805355	We can help you.
805395	806876	We've played plenty of Trauma Center.
806916	807616	We know what to do.
809597	812639	Remember, video games teach you about real life and shit, right?
812919	814600	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
814760	816541	Anyway, oh, hey, it's addressed to me.
817162	819903	Ride and Rock Online 2, Gate of the World private servers are up.
820484	823465	The one I play on is euphro2.com.
823505	826687	It's E-U-P-H-R-O-2.com.
827288	831390	It runs off Korean beta software, and only basic things are translated, menus and such.
831837	834658	The soundtrack is also much better than the first Ragnarok.
834678	841021	The game is also completely different from the first as it runs in 3D, and you can change classes whenever you want, as long as your job level is over 5.
842041	845703	And the game runs surprisingly a lot like World of Warcraft by interface and battle system.
846343	855827	The private server has two servers, a test that's 100-100-100 rate, and a main server, I don't know what rates, assuming it has rates as their RO1 server, 3-3-3.
855987	859448	Anyway, that's from SakuraMax, and it says, waiting for something amazing to happen.
861261	863783	I'm surprised you're not all over Ragnarok 2 if it's out there.
863803	865365	Not until I find translated copy.
865805	866746	Like fully translated.
866806	869007	I mean, I'm going to look into this one tonight actually.
869168	870429	Sounds like soon though.
870849	875753	I'm going to look into this one because I'm very interested and I've read up a lot on Ragnarok 2 already.
876293	880957	But I tried to get into the official beta but I didn't have a Korean social security number.
882518	885781	By the way, Cheeseburger sent me a private message commenting on RuneScape.
885801	889424	He said, I played and one time someone was following me asking me for sex.
890925	891305	Wow.
891586	892787	I should be playing this game.
893167	893908	Sounds like fun.
894368	894888	Just kidding.
896470	897691	Anyway, can I continue?
898171	898351	Yes.
898431	898952	Next email.
899192	899512	Okay.
900513	901214	Hey, OLR.
901274	904657	I have been listening since episode 245, which I don't know which one that is.
905438	910342	I just wanted to tell you how rad your podcast, your postcast is, it says.
910962	916327	I have laughed so many times listening to you guys, and my ears do burn when you mention anything to do with Australia.
917250	923373	Last year, Loki mentioned a mobile game called The Coolest Girl in School, co-created by Champagne for the Ladies.
923713	926874	I actually worked next door to Champagne for the Ladies doing freelance game artwork.
927295	927475	Nice.
927575	930156	Loki referred to it as GTA for Girls, LOL.
930616	932497	Keep up the good work, pixel poison.
932577	933578	And this is from Australia.
933738	935318	It's someone from Australia, so that's cool.
935518	941001	I'm glad we didn't offend all of our Australian listeners when we were... It wasn't a couple weeks ago, we just totally...
941880	944161	Somebody asked us what the capital of Australia was.
944401	945701	I don't remember what the hell happened.
945741	947161	You asked me and I didn't know.
947321	947862	That's right.
948662	949202	So whatever.
949722	950422	It's not Sydney.
950662	951102	Maybe.
951122	951843	Remember that much.
952983	953443	It's all right.
954003	955544	I don't know my world capitals that well.
955584	957904	I know Australia, but that's because I'm part Australia.
957924	965346	They said that there's a two-year-old on YouTube naming off capitals of countries and all the states in the United States.
965906	966587	Well, you know what?
966667	967627	He's going to grow up to be a crack whore.
967647	968247	And he's two years old.
969396	971937	Are you smarter than a two year old?
972758	973538	Probably not.
1000831	1001571	Lord of the Rings-ish Epic
1029858	1034479	But they'd have to put some money and some star power and some writing and all that good stuff and some special effects into it.
1034519	1039540	What do you think, Rice Princess, being the big Zelda fan you are, do you think that they could actually make a movie out of Zelda?
1039740	1040440	Of course they can.
1040460	1041981	They can make a movie out of anything.
1042401	1043041	Yes, that's true.
1043181	1046562	They do sometimes, like, not well, but yeah.
1046802	1048862	No, the trailer, like I said, it was okay.
1049222	1052663	I mean, for what it was, an April Fool's joke, it was good.
1053423	1055904	For like a real movie, no, I wouldn't watch it.
1057384	1057644	Nice.
1058515	1059855	They should do an animated one.
1059875	1061836	That'd be cool.
1062116	1064056	Here's a crazy idea I've always had.
1064216	1067457	I think the Sci-Fi Network, you know how they sometimes do those random miniseries?
1067477	1070197	Like they did the Wizard of Oz thing not that long ago.
1070217	1074038	And they're kind of low budget, but they're decent, right?
1074778	1075719	Like a Lifetime movie?
1076099	1080299	Yeah, I think they should do like a miniseries adapting one of the Final Fantasy games.
1080860	1082660	It sure is boring around here.
1083760	1087741	Now, Squeenix would never ever let them do it, but I don't know, they should.
1088100	1089000	That would be kind of cool.
1089020	1092121	Because The Spirits Within sure as hell wasn't a Final Fantasy movie.
1093321	1095142	It was a good movie, it just wasn't Final Fantasy.
1096362	1102824	SSJ100 Matt would like to remind us they did make a movie out of Good Burger, so why not a movie for Legend of Zelda?
1102844	1103444	That's a good point.
1105285	1106545	Okay, I'm going to keep going, alright?
1106745	1106945	Yes.
1107285	1107825	Next email.
1108366	1109366	This is from J-Rod.
1109566	1109826	Woohoo!
1110996	1111856	Thank you for watching!
1126875	1127095	June.
1127115	1127775	It's coming out in June.
1153378	1161481	I'll get it if it has a custom mode in it, like a creator wrestler, because it's actually the only fun thing I like about those games.
1162941	1163641	Oh, I didn't know this.
1163721	1171403	Sagan Chat says, in response to my Sci-Fi Network comment earlier, you do know that Sci-Fi was in plans to make a Myst miniseries.
1171543	1173044	I did not know that, but that would be kind of rad.
1174813	1176374	Missed Online was interesting.
1176414	1180037	I'm kind of sad to see it go, but it took a lot of manpower to run that game, I think.
1180397	1181718	But Missed Online was creepy.
1181978	1183520	It was one of the creepiest MMOs I ever played.
1184180	1186582	It made me think, what if Silent Hill was an MMO?
1186602	1187262	It would be like this.
1187302	1188463	That would be beautiful.
1188944	1193287	But then you'd have to take a psychological exam so it could bring up monsters based on things out of your own psyche.
1193807	1198291	RossDLUT would like to point out that Midway's website also lists the game being Summer 08.
1198611	1199091	There you have it.
1200572	1201893	Can I read the next email?
1201913	1202474	Next email!
1202634	1204095	It's freaking long, but I'm going to read it anyway.
1205536	1207958	and this email was sent by DidYouLoseASock.
1209439	1209859	No, I didn't.
1209899	1210479	I'm wearing both of them.
1210719	1211240	I didn't either.
1211280	1211820	They're in the house.
1212100	1212701	I'm not wearing them now.
1212741	1213221	I'm barefoot.
1213381	1213901	I'm naked.
1214141	1214922	My feet are naked.
1218344	1218564	Okay.
1218864	1219265	Next email.
1219445	1225208	I went to an advanced private screening of the movie Postal by Yui Bull based off of the video game of the same name.
1225809	1227710	Easily one of the worst films I have ever seen.
1228445	1231168	EWI was at the screening and he is actually cool in real life.
1231248	1240118	Before showing the film he talked about the reasons he made it and wanted to make a film that he would like himself and did not care what critics or other people would think about it and that's what he got.
1240638	1245904	He also commented on how the Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler movies are all the same and they keep making them over and over again.
1246676	1255825	and about how the film 10,000 BC critics hated it 9% on Rotten Tomatoes yet it made over 200 million worldwide because the money put into the advertisements for the movie.
1256345	1261951	He also talked about how he is not the only one to do poor adaptations and pointed to the films Elektra and Catwoman.
1263072	1263712	Amen to that.
1264413	1267356	He talked about a few other problems with films in the film industry.
1267456	1270599	All the points he made were really great but his film still sucked in the end.
1271633	1274113	Every religion and race is made fun of in this film.
1274233	1278854	It was like a live-action South Park with crude humor and morals throughout.
1279274	1282795	Would the film have actually been good if everything was replaced with South Park characters?
1282935	1287216	Probably, but then again, I think anything would be really funny if it was replaced by South Park characters.
1287916	1289076	Is this film worth seeing?
1289416	1291816	It was so bad that some might find it good.
1292677	1297637	I might suggest this film over all those stupid spoof movies like Superhero Movie and Meet the Spartans.
1298498	1300838	Iwi Bull in the past has boxed critics
1301693	1304995	who would not like his films.
1305496	1312821	So after the film got over, of course, I did not like it, so I asked him to fake punch me for a photo, which he did and was a good sport about it.
1314962	1319926	Where I saw the film was a small private screening room that Ebert and Roper and other media people used to view films.
1320326	1324569	No major reporters were there, only smaller media outlets because of the status of the film.
1324949	1327351	It was an amazing place and better than the film itself.
1327811	1328592	Spoiler warning!
1328852	1329112	Should I?
1330436	1331116	No one's going to see it.
1331437	1332497	Yeah, no one's going to see it.
1332537	1333978	I'm going to see it, but that's fine.
1334018	1334559	Here's the thing.
1334619	1338381	Reduce the volume on your iPod for about 15 seconds if you don't want to hear the spoiler.
1339221	1339381	Now.
1339822	1346245	The only slightly funny part in this film where Yui will place himself as a stereotypical German dressed in lederhosen.
1347506	1354710	In the film, he talks about how his films were funded by Nazi gold and then fights the creator of Postal because he was mad at Yui for ruining his game.
1355311	1358653	I give credit to someone who can make fun of themselves, and I think he included the picture.
1360410	1361330	I'm trying to pull it up.
1361471	1362011	Oh, we did.
1364912	1365172	Nice.
1365452	1365912	There we go.
1367233	1367873	Very nice.
1368153	1368473	That's great.
1368493	1368874	Good picture.
1368934	1369434	That's great.
1369554	1370895	That's a MySpace photo right there.
1371715	1373676	Wait, I got punched in the face by UE Bowl.
1373696	1375116	Yeah, you should get that on a shirt.
1375156	1378178	You should actually print that on a shirt and say, I got punched in the face by UE Bowl.
1379790	1381231	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1401580	1404962	Loki is Tingle or Uwe Bolle is not in the film industry anymore.
1405142	1410446	I think you have a better chance of getting him to leave the film industry than me to dress up as Tingle.
1410686	1411206	Oh, snap.
1412847	1415049	Because at least signatures don't cost anything.
1416630	1417170	That's true.
1417911	1418591	True that.
1420392	1421173	Last email.
1421373	1422373	Last email.
1423114	1423874	Hi, OLR.
1423914	1427156	I'm a loyal podcast listener and wanted to tell you how much I like your show.
1427417	1427897	Well, thank you.
1428453	1430935	Your show makes me happy and Loki's runs always make me laugh.
1431055	1434637	In fact, you guys make me laugh so much that I've gotten used to awkward stares in public.
1435317	1437479	Thanks for making such a great show and please keep it up.
1437599	1439099	And this is from Able2Think.
1439680	1440060	There's more.
1440881	1441181	P.S.
1441241	1446904	DarkSakura, I know how much you love Treasure, so I thought I'd let you know that the bleach fighting game on DS is made by them.
1448405	1449005	P.P.S.
1449106	1450006	An interesting question.
1450046	1451307	I'd like to hear your answers.
1452026	1480085	a woman while at the funeral of her mother met a man who she did not know she thought he was amazing she believed him to be her dream partner so much that she fell in love with him right then and there but never asked for his phone number or address and could not find him after the funeral a few days later she killed her sister so the question what was the woman's motive for killing her sister now think about it why would you think that she would kill her sister I don't know do I care
1482411	1483572	Dr. Phil made her do it.
1484073	1485094	I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
1486196	1487818	So she can see the guy again?
1488779	1489119	Okay.
1490541	1490861	Answer.
1491202	1493605	She was hoping the man would appear again at her sister's funeral.
1494025	1496228	If you answer this correctly, you think like a psychopath.
1496914	1497994	Oh, I've heard that thing before.
1498014	1502896	This was a test used by a famous American psychologist to test if someone has the same mentality as a killer.
1503317	1507778	Several incarcerated serial killers took part in the test and all answered the question correctly.
1508199	1509999	If you didn't answer the question correctly, good for you.
1510499	1513181	If you gave the correct answer, please let me know so I can keep an eye on you.
1513721	1515942	And then they're interviewing someone.
1516342	1518443	So what was the motive?
1519163	1519563	I don't know.
1519683	1521304	And then they stabbed him in the face.
1522204	1523665	Let me tell you about my mother.
1523705	1524225	Ba-dum-bum.
1525713	1528255	Or you could just be good at logical deduction.
1528375	1531096	I mean, you don't have to think like a psychopath.
1531797	1533318	You can just think it out.
1537940	1539061	That was last email, right?
1540083	1542224	Yes, that was the last email.
1542444	1545405	By the way, kids, we have a list list coming up tonight.
1545485	1548726	Things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
1549126	1553367	I need everybody in studio to do a list of three things.
1554307	1555188	But there's too many.
1555208	1556408	We only can only do five.
1556428	1557308	Yeah, I figured that much.
1557348	1559129	So Irene and Nathan, you guys can combine a list.
1559169	1560609	So think a list of three things.
1561070	1563370	Things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
1563390	1564791	Does anybody need cards to write things down?
1564811	1565431	Because I built cards.
1566151	1567152	I would like a card, Rob.
1567172	1567472	Here you go.
1567492	1567972	Here's a card.
1568193	1568673	Here you go.
1568893	1569954	Thank you very much.
1570034	1571855	Do you have a pen or a pencil?
1572575	1574236	You can borrow mine, but you've got to give it to me.
1574256	1574817	Oh, we have a pencil.
1574837	1575277	Okay, good.
1575417	1576898	Never mind, but thank you very much, Rob.
1576918	1577879	This is great radio, by the way.
1577959	1578399	I know.
1578579	1579540	I'm trying to fill time.
1579560	1580580	Back to the news, please.
1581101	1581441	All right.
1581981	1586664	Well, I know I'm super excited this is finally launched, but guess what?
1587505	1589546	Engage is back, bitches.
1590527	1590967	That's right.
1591007	1594049	The Engage application has finally launched.
1595151	1605453	and it is compatible with Nokia's N81, N81 8GB, N82, N95, and N95 8GB phones.
1606173	1609214	And there are five games right now currently available for it.
1609394	1616115	Brain Challenge, System Rush Evolution, and World Series of Poker and I guess two other ones.
1616515	1624397	And then all the other games, or all the games I guess offer free trials and then can be purchased straight from a computer.
1625117	1625718	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp
1646533	1647595	I mean it is the end gauge.
1647895	1648416	Quick poll.
1648476	1651060	We're going to do a quick poll and chat right now.
1652042	1654926	I just want you guys to answer with yes or no.
1655842	1658124	Do you care about the N-Gage?
1658765	1659926	Chat room, answer now.
1660446	1660606	No.
1660626	1661427	We'll do this next story.
1661667	1662868	Do you care about the N-Gage?
1662908	1664269	That is the whole chat room.
1664369	1664930	All right, let's see.
1664950	1665971	Spoken on behalf of them.
1666131	1667932	I'm just going to see while I read this next story.
1668253	1669754	This is something people might care about.
1670014	1672436	Saints Row 2 is coming out on August 26th.
1672616	1673858	Are you excited about this, Loki?
1673918	1674478	Fuck yeah.
1674638	1676600	Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
1676920	1680383	This was announced at the THQ Gamers Day, which was in San Francisco earlier this week.
1680403	1681584	Which we didn't get invited to, those fuckers.
1681624	1682325	No, we never do.
1683045	1685566	There is a Saints Row 2 website now up and running.
1685606	1689347	It's at saintsrow.com, not saintsrow2.com, but saintsrow.com.
1690048	1696690	And the timing of it is between Grand Theft Auto 4 and Christmas, so it's a pretty good time.
1697170	1698371	So there you have it, Saints Row 2.
1699881	1701523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1716678	1721399	with Uncle Gary talking about different aspects of the game that are new to Saints Row 2.
1722219	1725860	And, of course, for those who aren't aware, Uncle Gary is Gary Busey.
1726620	1726940	Nice.
1727040	1727940	It is pretty funny.
1728580	1732821	But there are some new things, especially if you've been reading any of the previews on there.
1732861	1737302	There are sticky satchel charges that you can throw on people and detonate them remotely.
1737382	1739942	And then you can actually throw people in this game.
1740642	1742743	And there's different taunts you can do, including...
1744369	1746469	I believe you can teabag someone in this game.
1747150	1747470	Lovely.
1748010	1749530	Here's the results of our quick poll.
1749630	1751150	Do you care about the end gauge?
1751170	1751690	Here we go.
1752171	1752431	No.
1752731	1752991	No.
1753271	1753531	No.
1753811	1754051	No.
1754311	1754571	No.
1754831	1755071	No.
1755311	1755551	No.
1755931	1756511	No.
1757072	1757332	No.
1757612	1757852	No.
1758112	1758372	No.
1758632	1758872	No.
1759152	1759372	No.
1759592	1760172	Hell no.
1760452	1760692	No.
1760952	1761172	No.
1761793	1763793	No.
1764113	1764433	Vader.
1765013	1765353	Yes.
1766313	1766934	Kinda.
1767634	1767934	Yes.
1768534	1768794	No.
1769154	1769454	No.
1769954	1770454	The what?
1771114	1771915	Yes, it's a no.
1772415	1772675	No.
1773015	1773275	No.
1773655	1773855	No.
1775899	1781982	BlackWolfClarifies is kinda saying, some of the games I saw for the new N-Gage platform had some neat ideas, so kinda.
1782622	1789286	And lastly, Mayusatsuma says, the only N-Gage I care about was the one from Star Trek The Next Generation.
1790166	1792388	No, God, why?
1792408	1795549	You love that show, Jack.
1795569	1797210	Chat comment of the night, I love it.
1797590	1798351	That's my favorite.
1798711	1799051	You win.
1799071	1801512	So there you have it, the results of the quick poll.
1801532	1802293	I answered the poll too.
1802553	1804194	Live radio is awesome.
1804973	1806254	What did you say, DarkSakura?
1806354	1807134	Padme, no.
1808375	1808895	Alright, look.
1809815	1811296	Next story, please, DarkSakura.
1813337	1814578	Okay, okay, okay.
1817619	1819220	Oh yeah, it would help if I actually could find it.
1819280	1819880	Okay, there we go.
1820341	1821961	Gran Turismo PSP.
1822642	1823282	Who cares?
1824483	1825323	Okay, some people do.
1825343	1827484	It's actually delayed until 2009.
1827544	1827704	Yeah.
1827744	1827824	Yeah.
1833234	1837955	It should be noted that it's actually called Duke Nukem Forever's Gran Turismo for the PSP.
1840676	1844657	I call it, you know, you've got prologue, I guess.
1845577	1846117	It doesn't matter.
1846137	1852959	You know, it's funny, though, because they were showing this thing off like, I want to see before the PSP came out.
1853139	1855960	Wasn't it one of the things that they were saying, hey, yeah, it's going to be so awesome.
1856300	1858701	Yeah, I thought they were talking about Ridge Racer, though.
1859001	1859681	Didn't happen.
1862697	1866120	IGN It happens to the best of us.
1886155	1887295	IGN had a few things.
1888055	1892876	First, their story about a game called Skate It coming out for the DS and the Wii.
1892916	1898857	That's right, that's a version of the game put out by EA that will be coming to the Nintendo platforms.
1900197	1904138	No word on when exactly it will be coming out.
1904238	1912820	Of course, the information was very brief, but they did say that they were talking about using, of course, the Wii Remote...
1915612	1917113	And you know what's better than spoiling one game?
1933757	1940841	Spoiling two games because IGN did the same damn thing with an upcoming Batman game.
1940901	1942242	The story was pulled.
1942843	1945104	There was not a lot of details on the game.
1945164	1949787	It was pretty much, I guess, just a generic kind of blank page that just indicated there was a Batman game coming.
1950507	1955290	But you could probably put two and two together and figure that it was a...
1957031	1958712	Dark Knight Adaptation.
1959272	1964874	And keep in mind, Pandemic is the company that made Destroy All Humans and Mercenaries.
1964934	1967715	And Pandemic was the company that was slated to make this Batman game.
1968055	1968815	So what do you think of that?
1968875	1970796	The folks making Destroy All Humans making Batman.
1971696	1972476	It could be okay.
1972596	1976298	Destroy All Humans has kind of been lost its edge since the first game.
1976418	1978739	It's lost its edge.
1978999	1981399	But Mercenaries 2 looks fucking awesome.
1981680	1982940	I had a friend that worked on that.
1984351	1991535	It's interesting though, here's what they had, actually someone had copied this from the NeoGAF forums.
1992436	1992736	It said,
2008204	2009944	And now we know it's happening for sure.
2010064	2017386	Elevation Partners, who were owners of Pandemic and Bioware until the EA purchase, had gained the video game rights to the franchise.
2017426	2025448	We rumored last year that EA would publish the title, but now EA owns the aforementioned companies, and the publishing aspect was a given.
2025788	2035650	Unfortunately, we don't have any specific platform, a release date, or even an official title, but given EA's history, we would expect a game to be called The Dark Knight, released this July alongside the film.
2036751	2051190	and to hit just about every platform known to humankind I can tell you right now it's probably not coming out in July I was going to say it seems a bit late but if they are developing something like that it could also come out around the release of the movie on DVD that's what I'm thinking more DVD Blu-ray time
2051650	2051690	E.A.
2051710	2053012	actually did the last Batman game, I think.
2053032	2053192	Mm-hmm.
2053212	2053252	Um...
2068357	2070038	So, it makes sense.
2070558	2072399	Some of the Batman games really kick ass.
2072439	2075221	Like, the old school Batman on the NES was one of the best games.
2075241	2075921	Oh, that was fun.
2075941	2077362	That was one of the best games on the NES.
2077502	2078203	Heck yeah.
2078303	2079903	Batman Returns was kind of wonky.
2080084	2080884	I didn't play it.
2081004	2082565	The first Batman was pretty awesome.
2082765	2083185	Yeah.
2083766	2084006	So.
2084266	2084606	Again.
2085066	2088428	There are good movie adaptation games once in a great, great while.
2088748	2089929	Okay, list list coming up.
2089989	2091170	I hope you guys have your list soon.
2091270	2094932	It's coming right up after one more story, which is Jamie's story.
2095972	2096873	Yes, it is.
2098669	2105892	Samsung is bringing different games out for their smartphones and one of them is Second Life.
2107252	2122277	So basically they're actually showing it the CTIA wireless thing that was going on where you can access it using the smartphones and talk through a text and SMS.
2122657	2126919	So they said that they want to launch it in the second half of this year.
2130505	2131005	All righty.
2132566	2135808	It's going to be interesting, though, if you can have that crack with you.
2136208	2138350	It's Furry's Portable is what it is, right, Drew?
2139010	2139630	Furry's Portable.
2140491	2140751	All right.
2141571	2143693	Okay, here's the deal, guys.
2143793	2152738	We're going to play a little game we have been playing since our first couple episodes here on Live365 right on down to the very last episode on Live365.
2153178	2155079	It's a segment we call Listless.
2159161	2165086	Tonight's list list, the topic is things Live365 could do to get us to stay.
2165467	2168369	It's been a little while since we've done list lists, it's at least been a few months.
2168449	2170491	Some of our games only show up once every few months.
2171652	2180540	Here's the deal, the way it works is that we're going to go around the room and each person is going to name their top three, one at a time, things that Live365 could do to get us to stay.
2180560	2181541	Has everybody done with their list?
2182637	2187081	If anyone is still in need of suggestions, chat room, you can try to influence us now.
2187461	2193708	If you have a good idea for things Life 365 could do to get us to stay, start posting those suggestions in chat now.
2193768	2196811	And maybe a host or a guest will pick up on it.
2197151	2202656	But then, after the list is made, so we'll get a big list that has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 things on it.
2202957	2206020	Then we're going to go around and we each take one thing off the list.
2206772	2208095	We vote something off the list.
2208155	2209317	It's off the island, okay?
2209357	2209758	No more.
2210139	2217855	So it's off the list, and then the chat room will take that list of then 10 and vote on their favorite, and we will come up with the definitive list!
2218502	2220724	of things Life 365 could do to get us to stay.
2221064	2229190	Participating tonight, DarkSakura, myself, Loki, Drew, and so that we don't have too many people, Bryce Princess and Silent Nathan.
2229591	2237377	I think that's going to be his new name, like Silent Bob, Silent Nathan, are going to be combined as one person because they're a couple and you can do that to couples.
2237477	2238458	Oh my God, that's so cute.
2238738	2239939	What do you think of that, Silent Nathan?
2242080	2242641	That's what I thought.
2242781	2243041	All right.
2243061	2245403	I'm just giving him a hard time.
2247435	2248916	It's because his girlfriend hogs the mic.
2248996	2249336	Alright.
2250357	2250917	What do you mean?
2250977	2251838	I don't hog the mic.
2251858	2252698	You shut up now.
2253218	2254119	Alright, here we go.
2255760	2257121	Let's start off the list.
2257441	2259562	We'll start tonight with Drew.
2260482	2264304	What is your number three thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay?
2264965	2265805	Ferret radio.
2266065	2267286	All ferret, all the time.
2269995	2272036	AllFerret Radio, AllFerret all the time.
2272216	2274737	I don't know if I've ever fucking listened to that, but it might work.
2274818	2275918	All right, AllFerret Radio.
2276698	2280801	Rice Princess and Silent Nathan, your number three pick.
2282141	2285443	Provide the studio, via Irene, a unicorn.
2288820	2291180	Provide the studio a unicorn.
2291521	2292541	Via Irene.
2292581	2294461	Oh, that's the important part of House of Beetle.
2294921	2295841	I like that idea.
2295941	2297962	I think a unicorn would be fun.
2297982	2298742	It would be great.
2298802	2300022	I think that would give me a stay.
2300102	2302923	I'd stay with Life 365 if they gave me a unicorn.
2303683	2304943	And leave like six months later.
2305003	2307483	Once you have the unicorn.
2307503	2308604	Do I have to feed it?
2308704	2310124	I hope they provide food, too.
2310164	2312524	I'm pretty sure unicorns are self-sufficient.
2312704	2314205	Unicorns eat children.
2314225	2315545	Yeah, see?
2316989	2318070	We've got millions of them here.
2318390	2318710	All right.
2319530	2320371	Let's see what happens.
2320531	2323713	I'm just curious what Bobby Blackwolf thinks of this whole segment.
2324873	2329816	I'm seeing if he suggested anything because, you know, it could change.
2329856	2331537	We may have to pull out of the deal.
2331597	2336640	If Live365 is able to provide a unicorn, we might have to pull out.
2336940	2338921	Well, let's see what some of the other things are on the list.
2339481	2340662	DarkSakura, we'll go to you next.
2341122	2342463	Number three, your number three pick.
2342643	2344344	Pay for me to relocate to England.
2347168	2347968	Just you?
2348869	2349129	Yes.
2349709	2351610	Okay, me and the people of my choice.
2352650	2360593	Okay, sorry, I'm slow.
2360694	2364215	I'm typing as we do this here, so it takes me a minute.
2367176	2367696	Sorry, filler.
2367917	2369157	Thank you.
2369197	2369917	Irene, sing.
2369957	2372138	When we need a little filler, you're going to sing, okay?
2372178	2373319	I can dance, I can sing.
2373339	2375440	Well, that's why we have the theme music, too, so there's something to listen to.
2375660	2377360	Loki, your number three pick.
2378261	2380882	I would like Ken Kutaragi's heart on a platter.
2381362	2382602	Kalima!
2383063	2384203	Kalima!
2386704	2387684	I'm sorry, we can't do that.
2387704	2388405	We're out of platters.
2388425	2389065	That's sick.
2389825	2390466	You're sick.
2391846	2393927	I bet you got that serial killer question right.
2394904	2396926	Ken Kutaragi's heart on a platter.
2397046	2397486	Oh, God.
2397867	2398807	Lawsuit in the air.
2398827	2399348	All right.
2399368	2400169	Sue Live 365.
2400209	2400629	Don't sue us.
2401009	2401370	All right.
2402290	2403912	Obviously, he's joking.
2404432	2404793	All right.
2405593	2406134	Obviously.
2410117	2411558	Oh, I love what the chat room suggests.
2411598	2415242	I'm going to read that later after what we get here.
2415262	2415542	All right.
2416082	2417303	My number three thing.
2417383	2417784	Here it is.
2417824	2420266	The number three thing Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
2420993	2424916	Force Compile to reform and make a sequel to The Guardian Legend.
2425076	2425457	Yes!
2427478	2427979	Dot com.
2432743	2437647	If Live 365 wants us to stay, they will force compile to get back together and make a sequel to The Guardian Legend.
2437727	2438067	I don't know.
2438387	2441290	At gunpoint, however they have to do it, but that's the only way we're staying.
2441670	2442030	All right.
2442831	2443231	Here we go.
2443311	2444572	The number two way...
2449336	2451857	Make tuner software that doesn't suck.
2452477	2454678	Make tuner software that doesn't suck.
2454758	2456839	Radio 365, I'm looking at you.
2461661	2463801	Why do you think that I was using the SAM2 broadcaster?
2464101	2465202	Alright, nice.
2467142	2474245	Irene and Silent Nathan, what is the number three, I'm sorry, number two thing that Live365 could do to get us to stay?
2474929	2476510	Blowjobs for everyone.
2476530	2482232	That was my number one answer.
2483632	2484953	My number one was blow me.
2487254	2488914	Now I'm going to have to change that, you asshole.
2489034	2491035	That's okay, I'm stealing a great one from chat.
2491375	2492776	Alright, let's see.
2494356	2495537	DarkSakura, you're number two.
2495997	2496717	My number two?
2497397	2499898	That would be to pay me $100,000 a year to do Orange Lounge Radio.
2506349	2509650	by me I mean us each and guests get like $5,000 a visit they get royalties
2528519	2530439	I guess that kind of is the same thing as what she said.
2531099	2532180	Is that a reference?
2532200	2533200	Alright, here's mine, here's mine.
2534060	2540401	Pay us $200,000 a year to do Orsandria.
2540981	2543782	That was actually my original number three.
2544602	2545362	I'm serious.
2545442	2545842	Lovely.
2546042	2551223	Alright, so we have pay $100,000 a year to do Orsandria, immediately followed by pay $200,000 a year to do Orsandria.

2557444	2558605	Heal my pancreas.
2559406	2562029	They could do that with a unicorn.

2569216	2573800	Heal my pancreas, the number two thing that Light365 could do to get us to stay.
2575241	2578665	Alright, yeah, DarkSakura, heal please.
2580322	2581062	Give Jamie a cookie.
2581082	2582103	How about give Jamie pastrami?
2598286	2599567	I like pastrami better.
2599847	2600207	All right.
2600687	2602348	Oh, give Jamie a pastrami cookie.

2660130	2660430	Good answer.
2675984	2677145	I think that's our winner right there.

2678805	2681567	Bucked up is DarkSakura's number one answer.
2681987	2683308	Loki, your number one answer.
2684068	2687410	I was going to go with George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine.
2690051	2692272	Oh, you mean the PS3?
2692332	2699416	This isn't my choice, and I'm sure this is for the chairman, because I sure as hell wouldn't want to see this happen, but purchase one million copies of The Eye of Judgment.
2704588	2706169	Somebody check this man for a fever.
2707470	2710091	God damn it, that's the one I was going to steal, you ass.
2710512	2712253	All right, then put in George Foreign Folk.
2712293	2713253	No, grilling machine.
2713714	2714434	No, it's too late.
2714474	2718717	You said purchase one million copies of Eye of Judgment is Loki's number one.
2718937	2723440	All right, so if Life is Five purchases one million copies of Eye of Judgment, then we'll stay.
2724440	2726361	And we'll have much LOL with it.
2726722	2727782	All right, my number one.
2728563	2731845	My number one would be the thing that Life is Five could do to get us to stay...
2732950	2736920	Buy us a George Foreman full cow grilling machine There you go
2747654	2752240	If you might remember from the... I think the last time we did this was for the Consumer Electronics Show.
2752320	2754603	Things we most want to see at Consumer Electronics Show.
2755124	2763174	And one of the answers was, buy us a George Foreman... I'm sorry, the answer was, a George Foreman full cow grilling machine that actually grills the entire cow.

2813000	2814522	This is a good list.
2814722	2818626	I thought this would be kind of a dumb segment tonight, but we did a good job.
2818646	2819908	Do you really have to remove...
2820868	2822529	That's the game, sorry to say.
2822850	2824531	Alright, we're going to start with the same order.
2824871	2825851	Drew Nami, we'll start with you.
2826792	2828853	Which one of these items is not worthy of the list?
2829233	2830734	The $100,000 a year.
2830934	2831955	I knew someone had to do that.
2832295	2835337	Pay $100,000 a year to do OLR is off the list.
2835757	2840600	Alright, Rice Princess and Silent Nathan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
2841761	2843862	Pay $200,000 a year.
2845163	2847024	Damn, throw the baby out with a bathwater.
2847044	2848545	Do you not like money or something?
2848565	2848605	No.
2851040	2855226	I put it in there that it's paying $5,000 each minute.
2855266	2858229	Nathan's more interested in blowjobs for everyone, alright?
2858810	2860032	Alright, who's next?
2860712	2863135	DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
2863296	2864277	All ferret radio.
2864677	2865939	All ferret radio.
2866299	2867341	Because we have that anyway.
2870411	2872472	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
2872692	2876513	I know this is going to sound weird, but blowjobs for everyone, because who knows who's giving those blowjobs?
2876553	2878213	I mean, that could be some scary shit.
2878253	2881294	Yeah, have you ever watched Cat House Girls?
2881614	2881834	No.
2882894	2884075	It could be some scary stuff.
2885215	2887556	It could be Air Force Amy.
2888016	2888376	All right.
2888436	2888776	Bye.
2890124	2906871	My turn, we have Provide a Unicorn, Pay for DarkSakura to go to England, Ken Kudaragi's Heart on a Platter, Force a Sequel of Guardian Legend, Make Tuner Software Doesn't Suck, Heal Rob's Pancreas, Give Jamie a Cookie, Go Back in Time, Make Me Vote for Chrono Trigger, Not a Damn Thing, Purchase 1,000,000 Copies of I, Judgment, and Buy Us George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine.
2907311	2911753	The one I deem not worthy of the list, Ken Kudaragi's Heart on a Platter.
2911773	2913194	Because that's kind of sick.
2913614	2914014	All right.
2915255	2915595	All right.
2916454	2920436	Here is the list that you in chat can vote for.
2920476	2927058	You're going to send me, Sky, a private message in chat with your top two in order.
2927298	2931080	It's important because your first pick actually gets two votes, okay?
2931520	2933381	Here is the list as it stands.
2933501	2937882	I'm about to paste a big thing in chat, so brace yourselves.
2937922	2938362	Here we go.
2940363	2941484	As Rob gets kicked from chat.
2941504	2942224	No, I won't get kicked.
2943156	2943836	Okay, here we go.
2943896	2945057	Here is the list as it stands.
2945077	2949078	I hope that doesn't win because that's kind of easy.
2962023	2963064	Make it win, people!
2986124	2988165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3012535	3017358	I didn't even realize that came out this week, but that was one of the days I was in the hospital, so I must have missed it.
3034469	3038690	So do you get all the Mr. Peabody and stuff, too?
3038830	3041331	Yes, Mr. Peabody, Sherman, they're all in there.
3041791	3041991	Really?
3042031	3046452	I have to tell you a bit of trivia, though, about the Data East machine.
3047412	3053053	The picture of the Wayback Machine, right next to it is the DeLorean from Back to the Future on the playfield.
3053914	3054334	Awesome.
3055414	3055714	All right.
3057045	3058045	I'm going to have to check that out.
3058085	3059226	I didn't realize that had come out.
3059266	3062027	But I do have Pinball FX and I would like some more tables for it.
3062047	3063187	So I'm definitely going to check that out.
3063467	3066748	So I'm glad we do this show because I missed a lot of gaming news while I was out.
3067288	3068468	All right, let's move on with the gaming news.
3068488	3069569	I've got to start tallying some votes.
3071049	3072170	Oh, that would be my turn, wouldn't it?
3073270	3073830	I think so.
3074390	3081152	Well, there is talk about a game called Velociraptor Safari coming out to the iPhone.
3082513	3083273	And you know what?
3083960	3092564	As much as I appreciate iPhone gaming, you know, and what they're doing with it, I don't think I would find it in my heart to play Velociraptor Safari.
3092624	3093205	Fuck that shit.
3093225	3094565	Bring us Jumbo Safari.
3094605	3098367	If you haven't played Velociraptor Safari, then it's fun.
3098647	3098928	Is it?
3099548	3100168	How fun is it?
3100208	3101029	Do you get to kill them?
3101329	3103230	Yes, you have a giant spiky chain.
3103250	3104410	I will kill Velociraptor.
3104570	3109893	You have a spiky chain that you catch the Velociraptor with and you have to pull him through a portal type thing.
3110533	3111794	This is like Jumbo Safari.
3112789	3113670	with Velociraptors.
3113991	3121939	It's actually a web game, of course, and what they did is made the client compatible with the iPhones.
3122180	3124862	No cost to you, which is awesome.
3125423	3127345	Well, maybe I'll have to give it a go.
3128066	3128506	Maybe.
3129547	3129968	I don't know.
3130328	3133672	I'm too busy listening to American Idol on YouTube.
3135356	3140962	Well, there are some new developments now in the world of PS3 piracy.
3141862	3146227	Unfortunately, there is now a PS3 backup launcher.
3146647	3151592	The problem is, though, it's still in alpha, and it only works on PS3 dev stations.
3152132	3159840	But what it allows you to do is boot PS3 games from the hard drive, boot games from a DVD or Blu-ray disc drive,
3160856	3169403	Copy original PS3 games from said optical drive to the hard drive and patch executables on some games to run from the hard drive.
3169964	3172065	So, I don't know.
3172205	3178450	It's a matter of time, I guess, before this becomes as vulnerable as, say, the PSP, which isn't good.
3178530	3185536	But I can imagine, though, that a lot of people probably wouldn't want to copy a 50 gig game to their hard drive.
3186196	3187017	That would probably suck.
3188258	3188378	So...
3190380	3190761	All right.
3191742	3193363	Sorry, I'm in the middle of tallying votes.
3193383	3195045	We had a lot of votes tonight, by the way.
3195825	3199589	If you want to vote, this is your last chance to vote in tonight's listless.
3200509	3202691	Things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
3203812	3207516	One more story before we get to some last-minute stories.
3208183	3216528	I figured this would be an appropriate story since OLR is always dedicated to giving you the current in gaming news and staying on top of what's going on in the scene.
3217449	3220111	There are new prototypes for the Atari 7800.
3221311	3221852	That's right.
3223113	3226695	You can actually download them, the ROMs, you can get them at AtariAge.com.
3227335	3228956	There's a game called Sirius.
3229076	3232739	It's a side-scrolling shooter that's kind of like R-Type and Gradius.
3233439	3233939	For the 7800, it's not bad.
3235302	3237623	Plutos is a vertically scrolling shooter.
3237743	3243505	It's not quite as ambitious as Sirius, according to the poster at LostLevels.org where this is found, but it's still not bad.
3243645	3252688	And Rampart, which apparently is some type of port of the arcade game that I quite enjoyed Rampart back when... Yeah, remember that game?
3252748	3254149	They ported it to a lot of systems.
3254529	3257910	Apparently there was a prototype for the 7800 that never quite got off the ground.
3258851	3259511	So there you have it.
3259571	3261232	I actually have a couple 5200 prototypes.
3263156	3264317	Actual cartridges or just ROMs?
3264557	3267739	Well, the remakes like that that they did.
3267779	3268680	I have a couple of them.
3268960	3271242	I always wanted to pick up one of those flashback consoles.
3271282	3272122	I think they're kind of fun.
3272683	3273543	I might still pick one up.
3274183	3275925	But they don't have Activision games in there, do they?
3277666	3279967	I'm going to get made fun of by Irene for this, but I don't care.
3280047	3281488	I think they have an Activision one.
3281708	3285451	My favorite Atari 2600 game of all time, well, there's two.
3285671	3288293	Pitfall 2 is the first, but the other one is Kaboom.
3289173	3290354	Why would I make fun of you?
3290374	3291575	Because you make fun of me for everything.
3292190	3293852	Ask Orange Lounge Ask Orange Lounge
3312742	3313262	Hooray!
3314103	3325248	Somebody, for some reason, I don't know why, but there's a picture on Xbox 360 Fanboy of a Master Chief My Little Pony that someone made, and it's kind of weird looking.
3326448	3329169	That creeps me out.
3329610	3330290	It gives me nightmares.
3330310	3331010	It's very creepy.
3331631	3336293	There's also some videos on Xbox 360 Fanboy of the new download content for...
3338540	3344983	Burnout Paradise, actually, and that's also available on the developer's website, CriterionGames.com.
3345383	3347363	They have a thing on there for that.
3347383	3349044	Let's see here.
3349824	3355126	There's also, this was another one of the April Fool's jokes that was out there.
3356487	3359688	Super PP Brothers, it was from ThinkGeek.com.
3360328	3367631	They did, like, the thing that would, the Wii remote would kind of fit into this, almost like a jockstrap or, like, panty thing that you would put on and
3368069	3368790	GameRadar.com
3395854	3399457	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3419372	3420312	Yeah, Mario 3.
3420752	3425853	And then they also have Paper Bowser World, Paper Bowser World, Operation Grom.
3426294	3430214	Those are two full games that are done kind of similar to Super Paper Mario.
3431175	3438676	And then Neo Sonic Universe, which looks kind of cool, kind of a brand new side-scrolling Sonic game.
3439116	3446478	Of course, the Metroid 2 remake, which now has a playable demo work-in-progress demo
3448197	3476185	and then finally Chrono Resurrection which of course you may remember got cancelled it was the full 3D remake of Chrono Trigger and I think which should be added to the list they have that new Mario game that someone was making that was a mashup of Halo, Mega Man and all that stuff that should probably be added to the list but if you go check out the article which is on Dig right now and it's also on GamesRadar.com they have links to most of the games that you can download of course not Chrono Resurrection because
3477202	3478704	Only the devs get to play that one.
3482848	3484209	And then I got to import this game.
3485450	3486712	Momo World War 2.
3487112	3492357	It's like chicks in, Nazi chicks in bikinis or something done anime style.
3492858	3494199	Right.
3494499	3496021	Sexy Nazi anime girl game.
3497102	3498463	I don't know, that sounds pretty awesome.
3499885	3500205	All right.
3502329	3505590	All right, guys, ready to figure out who won tonight's listless segment?
3505850	3506350	Why not?
3506630	3508751	All right, let's reveal the winners tonight.
3510491	3515772	Things Live3CC5 could do to get us to stay the definitive list.
3516493	3520134	As voted by you, the chatters created by us, the hosts and guests.
3520574	3525675	Here it is, the number three thing that Live3CC5 could do to get us to stay.
3526823	3529225	Provide us a unicorn via Irene.
3529766	3530626	Number three?
3531427	3532668	Unicorns can do anything.
3532708	3533789	That should have been number one.
3533829	3536592	It would have made all the other dreams come true, but I won't mope.
3537112	3537412	All right.
3537452	3537893	I'm okay.
3538113	3540455	At number two, we have a tie.
3540995	3542156	At number two, we have a tie.
3543017	3548602	Number two, buy us a George Foreman full cow grilling machine is more important than the unicorn.
3548862	3551044	How about a George Foreman unicorn grilling machine?
3551465	3551785	No!
3551805	3551845	No!
3553531	3555572	and Not A Damn Thing.
3555652	3556812	They done fucked up.
3558433	3559273	I was number two.
3559353	3560013	I was number two.
3560073	3560954	I was surprised too.
3561434	3564355	But then I looked at what was number one and I wasn't surprised at all.
3564395	3567536	The number one thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay?
3568656	3571737	Purchase one million copies of The Eye of Judgment.
3572977	3573738	Big surprise.
3573818	3575238	And settle this bet once and for all.
3575258	3578079	You do realize, of course, that Jamie does not get a cookie now.
3579213	3580474	That's okay, I can't have a cookie.
3580494	3581074	You know what?
3581214	3583155	Actually, um, let's see.
3583275	3586918	Heal Rob's pancreas would have been fourth, and then give Jamie a cookie would have been fifth.
3587558	3588358	I don't want a cookie.
3588719	3588999	Alright.
3589739	3590260	You know what?
3591300	3595323	When I come up here to do this show the day after my birthday, I want banana pudding.
3596783	3598705	Isn't it nice to want... Or carrot cake.
3601786	3602587	Those are my demands.
3605555	3606836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3635951	3636471	This is Rob's...
3665783	3667665	And yes, what would you like to say?
3668365	3674350	I would like to say that I am very sick because my pancreas hurts.
3676431	3677592	Anyways, it's Extifer.
3677632	3678233	How's it going?
3678253	3679614	Oh my god, Extifer?
3680034	3682016	Fine, even though you're an asshole.
3683817	3685018	So what's up, Extifer?
3685779	3691603	Oh, I'm doing pretty well, and you?
3692764	3695086	Well, my pancreas hurts a little bit, yeah.
3696563	3697544	Aw.
3697604	3698404	That's all right.
3698924	3702306	You should stop letting Irene punch you in the pancreas.
3702466	3703667	I'm going to do that, actually.
3703787	3705047	No, that's never going to happen.
3705808	3718174	Extifer, you used to do a show here on our station, our little network here on Live3CC5, and we already canceled your show once, and now we're leaving from Live3CC5 altogether.
3718214	3719034	Does that make you sad?
3723637	3724557	Yeah, actually.
3725598	3725858	I mean...
3726724	3739453	I was really, you know, sad when I couldn't do the show anymore because I live in another city now and it's hard, you know, for me to get over there to do any type of programming anyway.
3739533	3745136	So, I mean, we kind of ended, I mean, at least with me, it kind of ended a long time ago.
3745217	3751100	But, yeah, it does make me sad that we don't have the opportunity to do it again, I guess.
3752541	3754042	Yeah, it kind of sucks.
3754102	3754843	Unless they're...
3755353	3762435	What did you think of tonight's list list, though, with the ways that Live 365 could get us to stay?
3762495	3764796	Do you agree, or is there something else that you would have put on the list?
3768757	3771898	Oh, I'm all for the cow and the George Farman grill.
3772839	3773739	Sounds good, huh?
3773779	3778400	Well, actually... I'm like, you know, get me a cow, put it on the grill.
3779060	3781981	I am like, you know, meat central.
3782041	3783602	That's all I can think about.
3784695	3786456	Did he just say, I am Meat Central?
3786676	3787616	I think he did.
3787917	3788057	He did.
3788077	3789417	He said, I am Meat Central.
3789437	3790738	Yeah, I am Meat Central.
3791798	3793279	Is my connection breaking up?
3793339	3795340	Because I feel like the connection's breaking up.
3795440	3797360	No, it's just a little laggy, but that's okay.
3797380	3799601	We're going to wrap up because we want to get to some real calls.
3800462	3801002	Just kidding.
3801302	3801982	Oh, snap.
3802543	3803703	I'm a fake call.
3804083	3807765	But I just wanted to ask you real quickly, do you have any parting words?
3807785	3812567	I mean, it's not that we won't ever have you on all games, our new home, but do you have any parting words for Live365?
3816264	3821089	No, I'm about ready to go bleach my asshole, so that's it.
3822010	3822490	All right.
3822650	3824031	All right, have a good one.
3825233	3826033	Bye, Extifer.
3826053	3827695	All right, have a good synchronous.
3828255	3829316	All right, you too.
3829376	3829637	Bye.
3830563	3834244	Bye Christopher, I mean, Xtofer, we love you.
3836245	3837105	And your asshole.
3837125	3838526	That's what we should have put on the list.
3838586	3843787	Live 365 has to bleach Xtofer's asshole.
3843827	3844267	Oh god.
3844407	3845728	Oh my god, no.
3846388	3846668	Ew.
3846908	3847288	Alright.
3847789	3848369	Bleach.
3848649	3849069	Alright.
3849562	3851683	Here's the deal for tonight's Skype line.
3851703	3854864	We're going to open it up, but with some boundaries tonight.
3855264	3860106	Tonight, you can state your name, and you get to ask us a question.
3860406	3867709	But if you try to do anything else, like you start ranting about Jack Voldemort or whatever, then you're getting cut off.
3867889	3874392	Because tonight, we want to bring back for one last time on Live 365, Ask Orange Lounge.
3874412	3875032	You ready, Jamie?
3875192	3875753	This is for you.
3882219	3882859	Legend of the Doctor
3912000	3913781	State your question, Legend of Zaku.
3915662	3920685	Alright, basically, I know it's been like five and a half years and everything, but do you have any regrets?
3921365	3925487	Any regrets at all of the journey you've taken so far?
3927388	3928589	I'll start with DarkSakura.
3928849	3929509	Ladies first.
3930189	3932291	I regret letting Andrew tell jokes.
3934211	3934512	Loki?
3934652	3935432	I regret it too.
3936413	3938874	I regret ever doing an impression of Tingle's voice.
3938894	3940335	Laughter
3942270	3946371	I'm surprised you didn't say I regret ever buying karaoke revolution.
3947171	3947531	Too late.
3948192	3949352	Rice Princess, Drew, anything?
3949932	3950852	I regret nothing.
3951192	3954133	Wow, that's really freaking loud.
3954933	3955273	Drew?
3956074	3960135	If you say I regret... That's more than the question.
3963475	3963856	Hearts.
3964636	3965296	Here's the thing, though.
3965576	3969357	The only thing I regret, I'm going to be honest, not doing this sooner.
3970325	3971886	Hi, caller, state your name A lone vacationer
3996557	3998880	Hello, LoneVacationer.
3998940	4000262	State your question, please.
4003927	4011217	Yes, Rob, I was wondering why you had to be so retarded for Metroid instead of Chrono Trigger.
4013393	4018256	The sad thing is the podcast listeners aren't going to get this because they didn't hear the bonus segment tonight.
4018857	4024380	I voted for Super Metroid because I believe it to be the greatest video game of all time.
4024700	4029924	Look, as much as I love Chrono Trigger, I loved the Final Fantasy series just a little bit more.
4030004	4031925	The battles got annoying to me in Chrono Trigger.
4031965	4033606	I don't know what it was, but it did have a good story.
4034106	4044794	I respect Chrono Trigger as a game, but as far as Super Metroid, it was the music, it was the fact that it was a game that you could sit down and beat in one sitting, but it felt like there was so much you could do.
4045015	4052921	You could play it where you collect everything, you could play it where you explore everything, you could play it to speed beat it, and all of those things were accessible to a normal person.
4053301	4061888	Usually it takes a hobbyist to speed play through a game and stuff, but just with the items and everything, it's just a game I remember very much in my memory.
4062648	4063669	So, there you have it.
4066560	4069522	See, the caller knew not to say anything else because that would be more than a question.
4069942	4074705	All right, let's get to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4075805	4077106	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4077206	4078027	Ask Orange Lounge.
4078067	4078667	State your name.
4079587	4080668	The name is Ranma.
4080948	4083490	Hello, Ranma, and please state your question.
4084410	4090273	My question is to everyone, your greatest or favorite moment on Live365?
4092492	4094333	Oh shit, this is going to be a hard one.
4094433	4097734	Oh my god, there's so much.
4098975	4104417	Well, you can't say it though because that would be more than a question, but you could private message it to me in chat and I might read it.
4105277	4108598	DarkSakura, what was your favorite moment in all of Life 365's history?
4110179	4110699	Leaving it.
4113059	4114620	Episode 69, The Whole Thing
4139980	4140220	Nothing.
4140280	4140380	Okay.
4169099	4170660	Did I delete it on accident?
4170760	4171600	Oh, God, I did not.
4171620	4172640	Oh, Rob, how could you?
4172660	4174501	Oh, you did.
4174521	4175261	That would be terrible.
4176022	4179723	Well, briefly explain for the listeners what that was about, Loki.
4179763	4180103	What happened?
4180123	4185245	So we got nominated for most unlikely to hear on, like, terrestrial radio.
4185285	4186146	Hold on, let me see if this is it.
4189367	4190347	No, that's something else.
4190647	4192128	Why do I have a Kylie Minogue song in there?
4193128	4193829	God, I'm gay.
4194249	4194589	All right.
4196169	4197730	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4220106	4221927	Tom Brokaw on the West Coast, Fixing the Word Bukkake
4247814	4253220	This is actually a clip from Howard Stern, but it was so funny here on the show when they played it.
4266540	4267601	That's not right.
4267621	4268241	That ain't right.
4268281	4270542	People on the West Coast got gypped of hearing Bukkake.
4270702	4278625	And in this report out of Moscow tonight, two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously today.
4279225	4285688	The first crash happened in Bukkake, about 110 miles south of Moscow.
4286388	4287408	He said Bukkake.
4287509	4295972	That clip was courtesy of the Howard Stern Show, but that Bukkake thing, I swear to God, gave us like a month worth of stuff.
4297383	4298243	Gaming Radio, So Uncensored,
4328130	4330352	and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
4332254	4334175	Orange Lounge Radio.
4334536	4336237	Oh my god!
4336257	4338279	You just talked over it, you stupid bitch!
4338879	4339800	Oh my god!
4339820	4341662	Orange Lounge Radio.
4349204	4350085	That's hilarious.
4351426	4352206	Oh my gosh.
4353307	4356970	That was more than a question, sorry.
4358491	4361714	You should play all of the old promos or buffers or whatever.
4361794	4362374	Oh, you can't.
4362615	4365577	Well, I mean, you could string them in a sequence or something.
4365637	4366678	Some of them are stupid.
4367398	4368199	I love them.
4368559	4369720	Some of them are so stupid.
4369780	4370961	They were like the ketchup.
4370981	4374524	I still have the nori, nori, nori promo.
4374983	4375644	That never aired.
4376384	4377065	Oh, wow.
4377145	4377966	That's old school.
4377986	4378766	I'll send it to you later.
4378786	4379127	All right.
4379947	4390857	My favorite moment in Orange Lounge Radio history was the drunk show where Jamie drank so much tequila she lied in my bed face down after consuming an entire box of waffles.
4390877	4391697	I wasn't face down.
4392018	4394540	And had me delivering waffles to her.
4394740	4399404	And I was running up the wall yelling, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.
4400665	4402607	And how sober was I by the end of the show?
4403893	4406795	We can't forget Super Bacon either.
4406915	4409517	And I wonder why my pancreas is fucked.
4409597	4411819	The deep fried rice.
4412499	4413760	Remember when we did peep jousting?
4413880	4414601	Peep Wars!
4414641	4416422	I think that was actually on a Wednesday night show.
4416922	4429511	Basically you take two marshmallow peeps and you put toothpicks in them and then put them in the microwave and it's peep jousting because they get really big in the microwave and then eventually one slaughters the other.
4430031	4431613	It's so fucking hilarious.
4432393	4432693	All right.
4432733	4433274	Good time.
4433314	4434595	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4434635	4435235	State your name.
4436236	4437377	GS68.
4437637	4438597	GS68.
4438918	4441419	And what is your question for tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?
4441720	4443561	Any progress on the Faname panel?
4444281	4446223	Any progress on the Faname panel?
4446683	4446923	No.
4448544	4449525	Shit.
4449545	4450686	That's more than a question.
4451726	4456309	And if I remember correctly, that's Memorial Day weekend, which is the first weekend in May?
4457310	4457550	Yeah.
4457590	4458311	Last weekend in May.
4458351	4458991	Last weekend in May.
4459211	4459932	Oh, okay.
4461293	4461413	Hmm.
4461980	4462580	Let me know.
4485742	4486823	Nelly with me, unfortunately.
4510473	4515156	I have actually a very favorite moment in live 365 history.
4515917	4517999	You better phrase it as a question or you're in trouble.
4520320	4520680	Okay.
4521261	4522382	This is Jeopardy, bitch.
4524203	4526765	Do you remember when Loki sang Oops I Did It Again?
4529403	4532826	I don't remember it, but I sort of remember vaguely doing something that wasn't funny.
4532846	4533967	It was still pretty damn funny.
4560754	4566878	How much do you charge for autographed Xbox 360 faceplates, and what's your favorite dish at the Olive Garden?
4584775	4586976	That was a two-part question, you little bastard.
4587456	4587916	That's all right.
4587936	4588676	We'll let it slide.
4590417	4590937	Here we go.
4591157	4593618	How much do we charge for an autographed Xbox 360 faceplate?
4593658	4596959	I don't see why we wouldn't charge anything more than the cost of the faceplate plus shipping.
4597179	4599160	I mean, we're not out to make a profit on it.
4599900	4603201	If you want one, which I hear you do, we'll work something out.
4603942	4605482	I've got some extra faceplates.
4605622	4605882	Do you?
4606283	4606543	Yeah.
4606643	4607383	You want to just give them one?
4608928	4611450	We need to airbrush it white and then autograph it.
4611690	4615033	Well, I have no extra white ones because I bought other ones.
4615793	4615993	Oh.
4616274	4617655	All right, we'll figure something out, Osfer.
4617675	4619076	And then the other question, I like this one.
4619096	4620797	What's your favorite dish at the Olive Garden?
4623939	4624560	The breadsticks.
4626401	4631364	Mine was the, what did they call it, pasta rustica or something like that?
4631525	4633286	And they got rid of it, those assholes.
4633566	4635207	And then I like the Tuscan chicken.
4635247	4636008	They got rid of that, too.
4636994	4637995	What a bunch of fuckers.
4638055	4639055	I'm mad at all of them right now.
4639075	4641057	Rob's not allowed to tell anybody he likes anything at the Olive Garden.
4641097	4644199	I can't eat them anymore anyway, at least for the next month while I'm on this.
4644239	4646881	I'm rather plain, so I always get the spaghetti with meat sauce.
4646921	4647741	You are boring.
4647761	4649723	I always used to get the shrimp scampi.
4649743	4650323	Folksenbach?
4650383	4650943	Shrimp scampi?
4651204	4653585	Actually, I really like the risotto.
4654446	4658809	What's the name of that chicken dish on our first or third date or something that I got?
4659049	4659189	Like,
4659704	4661386	I don't know, some chicken dish with pasta.
4661426	4664168	And I also like their zuppa, whatever the hell's in it.
4664348	4668512	Yeah, the white one with sausage and potatoes.
4669133	4669893	That's really good.
4669913	4671595	Oh, God, my pancreas hurts just thinking about it.
4671955	4673196	All right, thanks for the question, caller.
4673417	4673817	Take care.
4673917	4675318	We'll figure something out about that faceplate.
4675999	4678161	All right, Skype line's still open.
4678181	4678962	I don't see any need to close.
4678982	4680243	See, the calls are so short tonight.
4680823	4681864	Caller, please state your name.
4683206	4684327	It's SSJ100, Matt.
4684387	4685728	Hello, and please state your question.
4689286	4692547	My question is, what would be your dream interview to have on the show?
4693908	4695969	DarkSakura, your dream interview.
4695989	4696529	Akira Yamaoka.
4712324	4713724	We talked to him.
4714225	4717685	No, we didn't have him on the show, but we've seen him in person.
4718026	4719266	That's right, you narrowly missed it.
4719806	4728868	That's right, because somebody wanted to go interview somebody and lost the recording of the damn interview.
4729289	4731069	I'll throw a curveball at you in just a minute.
4731109	4732409	I'll tell you why, too.
4734210	4736931	Drew, what would be your dream interview to see us interview?
4737491	4738011	Freeze Pop.
4738965	4740446	We had one guy on the show, remember?
4741046	4741327	All of them.
4741367	4741727	All of them.
4741827	4743888	Here in studio performing a la Mo.
4744629	4744869	Yes.
4744949	4745269	All right.
4745449	4745869	A la Mo.
4745909	4746350	I like that.
4746390	4748011	A la Mo.
4749212	4751493	Rice Princess.
4751673	4755095	Christian Bale naked in front of me.
4756036	4756936	You're asking too much.
4756956	4758137	Via a unicorn.
4758297	4759498	Via a unicorn.
4759978	4761539	And there won't be a lot of talking.
4762380	4763200	I'm just going to say this.
4763821	4765702	My dream interview would be Morgan Webb.
4766903	4767183	Because...
4768547	4769268	I'd have a field day.
4769288	4770830	You better have a damn good reason.
4771751	4772412	I would have a field day.
4772432	4772912	Wait, wait.
4772972	4773833	I gotta stop you real quick.
4773934	4774154	What?
4774314	4776837	They posted an old video clip of her.
4777177	4777958	She was on the Tyra Bank.
4777978	4778499	Bye, caller.
4778519	4779260	Thanks for the question.
4779520	4784166	She was actually on the Tyra Bank show one time and spouting off some, like, three...
4785239	4790523	Three different types of gamers and what you can learn from your guy based on the types of games he played.
4790563	4792385	And that was so retarded.
4793225	4794446	Now, the chat room is yelling at me.
4794606	4799910	I don't want the interview because I think it's going to be... Let me ask her some questions in public.
4799970	4800731	That's all I want.
4802272	4802632	All right.
4803473	4804894	You forgot Nathan.
4805194	4805915	I'm sorry, Nathan.
4806975	4808497	I didn't have anything to say.
4809037	4809557	Damn it.
4809577	4810218	Oh!
4812296	4813256	He's so emotional.
4813636	4814697	Caller, state your name.
4817178	4817478	Hello?
4818018	4819438	Hi, caller, what is your name?
4819678	4821939	Yeah, um, Gold Banjo here.
4821999	4822439	Hello, Gold.
4822459	4829901	I was wondering, seeing as how you're at, like, an internet radio show and all, I'm wondering if anybody's ever, like, threatened you or stalked you or something?
4830722	4831162	Yes.
4831622	4833743	Wow, threatened us or stalked us.
4833783	4834303	That's a good one.
4834323	4835283	No one stalked you.
4835603	4837784	Um, I don't remember anyone.
4840265	4840725	Wait, who?
4841105	4841225	No.
4843616	4844677	Oh, God!
4845398	4845759	Did he?
4847861	4848642	Yes.
4848722	4849203	You know what?
4849503	4851706	There was a person that was borderline stalking me.
4854109	4855571	I'm listening to what you're saying now.
4879770	4881572	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4898319	4901762	I don't think we've ever really had anything beyond that, though.
4901802	4904524	And that was more just kind of like a silly internet prank.
4904724	4907125	Not that that's acceptable.
4907205	4907626	It's not.
4907986	4910187	But nobody's ever threatened us with death or anything.
4910207	4912929	No, we're not famous.
4913609	4913930	All right.
4914470	4916932	I'll threaten you with death if you don't change your vote.
4917172	4917432	Hi.
4918413	4918853	Shut up.
4918933	4919633	Hi, callers.
4919774	4920614	Please state your name.
4922235	4922635	Yo, what's up?
4922655	4923816	This is Ross Steel, UT.
4923856	4924937	Hello, Ross Steel, UT.
4924977	4926458	And please state your question.
4928188	4932953	How many blind monkeys do you think it took for Ubisoft to come up with the name HAWX?
4935236	4935957	One for each letter.
4936077	4936357	Four.
4940322	4940822	Only one.
4941183	4946929	Because you have to understand, Hawks is edgy because they have an X instead of a KS.
4947670	4948451	We're thinking 90s now.
4950296	4951216	It took 90 monkeys?
4951656	4952537	Wow, that's extreme.
4952577	4953257	I'm sorry.
4953297	4955417	You're laughing too much, and that's more than a question.
4955457	4956058	No, but just kidding.
4956078	4956958	But we've got to free up the line.
4957018	4957318	All right.
4957338	4959959	I like this.
4959979	4961799	This is like a condensed... It's great.
4961859	4967300	Look how many people were getting in tonight for the last... Okay, we still got... I know there's still people trying to get in, so I'm waiting.
4968781	4969041	All right.
4969061	4969961	All right, here we go.
4970041	4970541	Another call.
4971001	4972102	Hello, caller.
4972182	4973102	Please state your name.
4974528	4976669	Hello, this is your favorite Swede, AK River.
4976689	4979230	Why did you start out in Live 365 in the first place?
4979250	4980770	Go figure it comes from someone not from America.
4996977	5000281	Why did we start on Life 365 in the first place?
5001822	5002543	I have my answer.
5002563	5003685	I don't know if anyone else wants to contribute.
5004005	5004626	It was easy.
5005246	5005767	Here's the thing.
5005887	5007128	Well, two reasons.
5007369	5008250	A, it was easy.
5009136	5009636	www.DarkSakura.com
5039142	5039803	Thanks for watching!
5060723	5062204	We didn't talk about that very much
5089713	5090794	Let's see if we get some more.
5090814	5095456	1-877-GAME-OLR How many more times?
5095516	5097277	Oh my god, this segment's going long.
5097638	5098898	That's alright, it's the last.
5099599	5100479	We got a little time, right?
5100499	5101080	You guys are okay?
5101400	5103001	Alright, Jamie's starting to get a little restless.
5103021	5104021	We gotta wind down soon.
5104422	5106483	Alright, hello caller, please state your name.
5110245	5110545	Hello?
5110885	5112766	Hello, hi caller, please state your name.
5115568	5116348	This is Misty.
5116989	5118650	Well, hello, Misty!
5119514	5120755	I'm glad to hear from Misty.
5121155	5126599	All right, Misty, I know you probably went waiting forever to get in, but please state your question.
5130041	5136925	If I were to win the lottery and bribe all of your bosses with however much they needed, would you people fucking come to ASEN?
5138506	5139247	I want to.
5139847	5145290	I have been... Sweetie, I love you.
5145310	5146391	No, no, no, this is Misty.
5146974	5150655	I really, really want to go to Ace and I've been bringing this up since last year.
5165055	5169182	We need to get our asses to Chicago and go to a convention.
5169543	5172828	And I actually need to finish one of my costumes to actually be able to wear it there.
5173409	5177516	And I also want to go hang out in Artist Alley with Megzi and Chris because they're going to be there this year too.
5178414	5182380	Honestly, I would be going this year if it wasn't for my medical issues.
5183501	5188168	I really was considering going this year and making it happen, but my medical issues have made me think twice about it.
5188208	5189169	It's very unfortunate.
5189209	5190110	But I don't know.
5190431	5193315	If a miracle pulls through in the next week, I might reconsider.
5193495	5194837	But right now I have to say no.
5196321	5198102	Loki, any chance in hell you'd go to ASIN?
5198502	5200144	Even if she won the lottery and paid for it for you?
5200824	5205048	Even if she won the lottery, my wife... I can't go because my wife can't stay home alone.
5205088	5206269	Can I represent us at ASIN?
5207309	5211233	If you can go, sure, go for it.
5211473	5213995	If someone pays my way, I'll go to ASIN.
5214535	5216136	Thank you for the call.
5216797	5217878	Everyone give Misty a kiss.
5218198	5219179	Bye, Misty.
5222374	5224735	All right, fun fact from Bobby Blackwolf.
5224855	5228356	All Games Radio was on Live 365 in one of its incarnations.
5228496	5233377	In fact, they used to give people the link to OLR to test the Live 365 player.
5234017	5234358	Wow.
5234378	5235098	That's great.
5235338	5238719	So, you know... Isn't it funny how things come full circle?
5239259	5240399	All right, maybe one more.
5240819	5241179	One more.
5241199	5242840	1-877-GAME-OLR.
5243360	5246021	I wanted to get Misty in because I know she doesn't get to listen live much and...
5247250	5249352	That's why I gave Misty the pass.
5249613	5250674	Because she's special.
5251335	5252176	It's a girl thing.
5252477	5253779	Admit it.
5254660	5255060	Here we go.
5255441	5255842	One more.
5256182	5257304	Last call, last question.
5258225	5258706	Guess what?
5258726	5259647	You're the last one.
5259707	5260708	Please state your name.
5262010	5262110	E.T.
5262887	5264227	Hello, DT.
5264988	5273430	First off, we all need to tip our hat to Dark Tetsuya for a moment and praise him for the work he's done for our station because he's been listening here since episode one.
5273851	5275351	He's been a longtime supporter.
5275691	5280693	He writes website articles for our front page even when the damn thing is deader than a doornail.
5281093	5283394	He has updated the OLR wiki with articles.
5283714	5285735	He keeps things posted on the forum.
5286055	5290016	Please, everybody, let's give Dark Tetsuya a round of applause for the hard work he's done for our station.
5295228	5295688	DarkTetsuya, please...
5323851	5325772	The last question of the night for Last Scorn's Lounge.
5329094	5330355	Okay, let me set this up.
5332657	5337240	As you know, she... Go ahead.
5339781	5343024	She is planning on coming to California in October.
5345745	5349648	Wouldn't there be a chance of getting her on the show somehow?
5351109	5352150	Is she going to be here on a Sunday?
5352310	5352730	Her and I.
5353334	5354315	I think I'll have to find out Wow
5383120	5383500	Thank you.
5383720	5384961	It's been a dream of mine.
5411292	5415055	Alright, damn, that's a lot of calls tonight and I think it's time to wrap things up.
5415095	5416676	We already did last minute stories.
5418057	5420379	Oh my god, we missed one thing though.
5420479	5424202	I was supposed to do it after the list list tonight and I completely glossed over it.
5424582	5426183	What segment did I forget, boys and girls?
5427464	5428325	What segment did we forget?
5428345	5430847	Yes, the FU's of the week.
5431888	5433089	Alright, I gotta get the music.
5433449	5434109	Holy crap.
5435250	5436111	Wouldn't that be hilarious?
5436131	5437792	This entire show's been an FU to Life 365.
5439982	5441003	So, whatever.
5441323	5445104	Okay, hold on really quickly, because I've got to set this up here.
5445144	5446384	So you may hear just a moment of silence.
5446424	5448325	Actually, I'll let the music play for a little bit.
5450066	5464911	Let the music play.
5465351	5467111	Here it is, the FUs of the week.
5467172	5468392	DarkSakura, start us off.
5469235	5486907	Fuck you, Live365 Loki Fuck you, Live365 Drew Fuck you, Live365 Rice Princess Fuck you, Live365 Silent Nathan And my F.U.
5486927	5488428	of the week F.U.
5488468	5496153	Live365 For upping your rates and using scare tactics to motivate it And F.U.
5496173	5496774	the R.I.A.
5497406	5500808	Yes, for starting the whole damn thing in the first place.
5501528	5504970	And honestly, this all goes back to you assholes forgetting our names.
5506190	5511433	No, actually, I got to say in seriousness, we have met some good people at Live365.
5512093	5513814	Remember Betty, she was a real sweetheart.
5514154	5515254	There are some great people.
5515274	5516415	And I got speakers.
5517159	5523441	When we say F you, we mean to the corporate decisions that were made there and not necessarily the people.
5523521	5530583	Just want to get that out there because in our five and a half years, we have interacted with a lot of great people and other broadcasters that we've met through Live 365.
5530903	5533283	So please don't misappropriate our angst.
5533884	5534184	All right.
5534684	5539765	So anyhow, that brings us to the very last part where we give our final thoughts.
5540886	5542266	Silent Nathan, any final thoughts?
5544567	5545747	Rice Princess, your final thoughts?
5549741	5550582	Drew, your final thought.
5550943	5551784	Indignation.
5553165	5554066	Loki, your final thought.
5554247	5558491	My final thought is I need to play some more games other than Saints Row.
5558612	5560954	Although I may go back to Saints Row to finish the activities.
5561375	5562756	Gotta get them achievement points.
5564759	5567462	My FU of the week... I'm sorry, not my FU of the week.
5568667	5575649	Well, it goes back to my pancreas, honestly, but my final thought is I really don't want it to flare up again and end up in the hospital.
5576009	5580951	I hate to sound like a baby in a hypochondriac, but keep your fingers crossed for me, kid.
5581511	5582251	The ferret is next.
5583152	5584312	Ferret, your final thought, please.
5586333	5588113	All right, Dark... All right, shut up.
5588133	5589014	You had two final thoughts.
5589114	5590454	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
5590914	5591835	Reject false icons.
5592635	5592915	All right.
5594266	5601110	That's going to do it for Orange Lounge Radio, the last live program here on our network on Live 365.
5601170	5604732	Thank you to all that have supported us since May 23rd.

5649041	5650402	That was a really big chapter one.
5650442	5651642	This is like War and Peace right here.
5651943	5658367	We look forward to the next chapter of OLR when we combine forces with All Games Radio.
5659375	5663898	and come together to make the Voltron of independent gaming podcasting.
5664278	5669161	And remember, if you like what you hear, tell a couple friends about Orange Lounge Radio.
5669281	5677505	It's word of mouth that helps make everything go around and brings more listeners to us so that we can slowly take over the world.
5678766	5680787	So, can I rant anymore?
5681547	5682308	Or is that it?
5682528	5683088	Are we done?
5683288	5684029	Are we out of here?
5684529	5684849	Sure.
5684869	5685409	We're done.
5685590	5686210	Goodbye, Life365.
