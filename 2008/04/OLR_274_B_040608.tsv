0	23840	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April 6th of 2008.
23840	29040	We are live here on our stream for the last time on Live 365.
29040	32280	This is the last piece of live programming, but for you people that download and listen
32280	36640	to our podcast every week faithfully, not a darn thing is going to change for you.
36640	41040	But we do invite you all to come on and listen to a live show, participate in the chat room.
41040	47320	The new place to do it will be www.allgames.com starting on Sunday the 13th.
47320	51320	But meanwhile, we still have some of this week's news to take care of, so let's kick
51320	56240	off this week's news for Part B with Loki.
56240	63820	So it's no surprise with the Dualshock 3 being released here anytime now that they're going
63820	69800	to be pulling the plug on the 6-axis, basically throwing motors in those old 6-axis controllers
69800	74440	that they have lying around and putting a new shell on it.
74440	79360	So if you're looking for a rumble-less controller, you're going to be out of luck.
79360	82760	However though, if you want to get with the times and actually have a controller with
82760	88640	that last-gen rumble technology in there, then feel free to head to the store, probably
88640	91920	now, and go pick one up.
91920	95800	Ross2UT says, That sucks!
95800	96800	I like the 6-axis.
96800	102000	That comment from chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
102000	103000	What do you think?
103000	104560	I mean, good thing or bad thing about this?
104560	108360	I think it just kind of sucks because it's going to cost so much money to replace now,
108360	110520	but I guess new console owners won't really care.
110520	116520	I kind of anticipated this was going to happen, so I already sold back two of my controllers.
116520	119960	So I just have two more now that I just have to replace.
119960	122800	But the thing is, though, now I think you're going to be fucked if you try to trade them
122800	125920	in like GameStop or something like that because no one's going to want them.
125920	127600	The value has gone down big time on that.
127600	128600	That's true.
128600	130400	No future games are going to support them, right?
130400	131400	No they will.
131400	134520	It just won't have rumble, probably.
134520	135960	The rumble will be disabled.
135960	136960	Gotcha.
136960	139760	Well, that's not the only thing Sony is doing.
139760	145720	Sony is shutting down the PS2 and PSP gaming servers for some of the online games.
145720	148240	Some games are no longer going to work after June 30th.
148240	149620	Now here's the weird thing.
149620	154160	One of the games on the list is Amplitude, but I thought that game already went down.
154160	158560	So some of these games, I think, are already gone because didn't Amplitude go down some
158560	159560	time ago?
159560	162120	Like they had Harmonix developers on the last night and everything?
162120	163120	I don't know.
163120	164800	Well, Sony is shutting down these servers.
164800	173560	There's a report, let's see, Jack X, Lemmings PS2, My Streets, Syphon, Filter Omega Strain,
173560	178240	Twisted Metal Black Online, Everybody's Golf, yeah, all those are all going away.
178240	183000	On the PSP, Lemmings and World Tour Soccer Tour, or World Tour Soccer 2.
183000	187880	Naturally, you can still continue to play those games offline, but what was that?
187880	192400	Those two games, those Twisted Metal Black Online had no offline version.
192400	197800	That game is useless now if you own it, and same with ItoyChat, it was only online.
197800	198800	Was ItoyChat on that list?
198800	199800	I didn't even see it.
199800	200800	Yeah, ItoyChat was online.
200800	201800	Doh!
201800	203880	Were there that many people in ItoyChat though?
203880	204880	I don't think so.
204880	206840	I remember seeing that and I was like, God, that's retarded.
206840	210760	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm still pissed off from when the Amplitude servers went offline.
210760	215640	But Twisted Metal Black Online kind of sucks though that there's no offline mode for that.
215640	217280	I don't know.
217280	218280	Whatever.
218280	222360	Alright, well those servers are bye-bye.
222360	226520	I wonder if somehow old news didn't leak through as new news this week, and we're getting fooled
226520	228960	too, because I swear that Amplitude thing is like a year old.
228960	230760	That was supposed to happen on June 30th.
230760	231760	Alright.
231760	236920	PSP, I've never heard of PSP games shutting their server down, so that element's new,
236920	238420	for sure.
238420	239720	Maybe some wires got crossed, I don't know.
239720	242000	Maybe it was Frequency that was getting shut down last time.
242000	243000	No, Amplitude?
243000	244000	For you seeing it was never online.
244000	245000	Oh.
245000	246000	I miss Amplitude though.
246000	247000	That was a great game.
247000	248000	I wish they'd make a sequel.
248000	251720	I wish that my computer wasn't being messed up right now.
251720	252720	Uh-oh.
252720	255080	Are you having problems connecting to the network?
255080	256920	Okay, there it is.
256920	261280	So, for some reason what happens is that, and this is just with my crappy laptop, is
261280	266600	that I'll have several different Firefox windows open, and then one of them will suddenly vanish.
266600	267600	Fun.
267600	269440	Until I minimize everything else.
269440	271440	Live Radio, what can you do?
271440	272440	Yeah, really.
272440	282480	Criterion is going to be transforming Burnout Paradise by doing a whole crap ton of updates.
282480	289920	The first of these is called Cagney, and they're all going to be named.
289920	296880	So as far as it's listed, there's going to be Cagney, Davis, Eastwood.
296880	300400	I guess so far that just looks like it's alphabetical, so whatever.
300400	303400	If there's one called Cagney, there has to be one called Lacy.
303400	304400	Come on.
304400	305400	That'll be when they get to L.
305400	306400	Okay.
306400	312400	So they're saying that these patches are going to be coming out over the year.
312400	313400	Well that's good.
313400	315960	They're going to keep the game fresh, and that's one of those games I played a lot for
315960	322040	two days, and I'm just kind of collecting dust right now, which is too bad.
322040	327000	They were showing off some pretty cool trailers for the new, well the first download content
327000	331000	for the game, which is going to be a new island.
331000	332000	That's pretty cool.
332000	337080	And then there's going to be a new off-road dune buggy type car that's going to be coming
337080	338080	in there.
338080	339080	Still looking forward to that.
339080	343120	Actually I'm just kind of keeping my game on the shelf to collect dust in the meantime
343120	345600	until they actually release that stuff, and then I'll go play it again.
345600	347640	I'm glad they're giving us reasons to go back, though.
347640	350680	I still need to finish Earth Defense Force 2017.
350680	354720	I finished Saints Row, so that's awesome.
354720	355960	Sunday, right?
355960	356960	Yeah.
356960	357960	So, let's see.
357960	364160	Some other cool stuff, I don't know, this may be cool if you're into Gran Turismo, or
364160	369000	if you have perhaps, I don't know, a younger sibling that you're trying to get into Gran
369000	370000	Turismo.
370000	374480	Apparently there's a game that they were talking about a while back called Gran Turismo for
374480	375640	Boys.
375640	379760	It was going to be a kid-friendly game, or kid-friendly version of Gran Turismo.
379760	382960	I guess it would be a lot easier for them to kind of get sucked into.
382960	385000	I don't think they should call it Gran Turismo for Boys.
385000	390040	I think the better name would be Gran Turismo for Kids, or something like that, since we
390040	395120	don't want to limit which gender can play the game.
395120	401140	But anyways, they were saying that that actually might come back in some form as part of Gran
401140	404040	Turismo 5, the standalone game.
404040	408560	And of course, when they were first announcing Gran Turismo for Boys, it was revealed in
408560	415840	November 2004 by Yakimuchi, and kind of the way to hook preteens on cars.
415840	420040	I guess, kind of like Hot Wheels or something.
420040	421480	How exactly do you do that?
421480	424160	Is it just that the cars are a little more silly, or what?
424160	427840	I don't know if it's a little more silly, maybe easier to tune or something like that,
427840	429760	maybe they walk them through on how to tune the cars.
429760	434860	I need that mode, I can't do all that stuff in those games.
434860	437960	That's why those types of games like Gran Turismo 4 aren't really for me, because there's
437960	440720	too much of that car shop stuff that I'm not really into.
440720	444880	I like Crazy Taxi, just push the pedal and go, and try to drive into people.
444880	449560	Have you seen that new game, it's supposed to be coming out in a couple weeks, Emergency
449560	450560	Mayhem.
450560	456400	It's just like Crazy Taxi, but with little Wiimote mini games and emergency vehicles.
456400	457400	Fun!
457400	460840	So, like, instead of taking him to Pizza Hut, you take him to the ER?
460840	464880	No, instead of, for example, it'll be like, oh, there's a dumpster on fire, and you have
464880	467280	to race over there and then put it out, you know.
467280	469120	And if somebody dies, it's game over.
469120	472560	Then someone's dying or whatever, you have to resuscitate them and stuff.
472560	473560	I don't know, it looks like fun.
473560	476600	What if I want to drive to the dumpster and feed the fire?
476600	479100	I don't know, maybe you can do that?
479100	480360	Throw the body into the dumpster.
480360	483920	Because I have to throw my passenger in the fire, that would be fun.
483920	487800	Well, that sounds more like a game that Rockstar would put together, and maybe they could do
487800	490480	that because they have more resources as of this week.
490480	494880	They've acquired a company called Mad Dog, I'm sorry, Mad Doc Software, Mad Dog is something
494880	500800	different, Mad Doc Software, and this now comes together and they form Rockstar New
500800	502800	England.
502800	509900	So Mad Doc Software hailed as one of the premier independent development studios in North America.
509900	514560	And so they're saying, the team at Mad Doc Software is extremely talented, bringing them
514560	518400	within the Rockstar Games family will enhance our core technology and further support our
518400	522160	commitment to creating progressive and innovative gaming experiences.
522160	527320	So another merger, and that's the sound of the corporate suck-up, and the last game they
527320	535520	worked on was the Bully Scholarship Edition, so port, and a broken one at that.
535520	539480	Gotcha, so it could be that more games are going to get ported, maybe that Grand Theft
539480	542960	Auto on DS isn't so incorrect, who knows?
542960	545640	Hey, I'm down for Grand Theft Auto game on DS, they have it on PSP.
545640	547160	Did you see that rumor about it earlier this week?
547160	552080	I think it's a misprint, I don't think it's, I mean something like that, they couldn't
552080	555600	really put Grand Theft Auto IV on the DS, unless it was top down, which would be pretty
555600	556600	cool.
556600	562360	All right, so now we're going to get into another segment here on the program, and we
562360	566700	like to do this every week, and this segment isn't going away or changing at all, we still
566700	572940	continue to ask you guys to email us every week with whatever feedback you have for the
572940	573940	program.
573940	574940	We do?
574940	576440	Yes, we do, like it or not.
576440	577440	Okay.
577440	581680	All right, and we call it our mailbag, so if you want to send us some emails, mailbag
581680	586200	at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send them, DarkSakura dives into the mailbag every
586200	590160	week and picks out a few of her favorite emails to read here on the air, and that's, you do,
590160	594440	because you're going to do it right now, or else, or else you go in that dumpster.
594440	595440	No.
595440	596440	Fire.
596440	601640	So, he just, Rob doesn't sing the intro for me anymore, anyway.
601640	604720	Maybe on all games I will, maybe.
604720	606240	On the fuck show I will.
606240	609040	He didn't sing the mailbag intro, I thought it was very-
609040	611760	That was the Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
611760	613840	Yeah, Let's Ask Orange Lounge, which we haven't done in a long time.
613840	615440	Why don't we?
615440	616440	We should do one-
616440	618560	For our Skype segment, let it be that.
618560	619560	You mean no Skype calls tonight?
619560	622160	No, let them call it on Skype, but have it be-
622160	624200	But they get to ask a question, that's it.
624200	625920	If they do anything else, we hang up on them.
625920	626920	That's it.
626920	627920	Okay.
627920	628920	I love that idea.
628920	631240	So, tonight's Skype segment is Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
631240	632920	You call in, ask a question, that's it.
632920	635520	You try to deviate the call, we hang up on you.
635520	636520	I love that idea.
636520	637520	This is a great mailbag.
637520	638520	Although we do take bribes.
638520	639520	Sorry, mailbag.
639520	640520	Okay.
640520	645160	Tonight's show is about thinking of new ideas for the future, isn't our show going to be
645160	646160	great?
646160	649040	I've been thinking of an amazing podcast since last October, and I think it's amazing.
649040	654200	But anyways, I know you guys play many MMOs, except for maybe Loki.
654200	658640	I was wondering what your thoughts are on crappy MMOs, such as RuneScape, or that's
658640	661040	pretty much the only crappy MMO I've played.
661040	665020	Well, it's not that bad, it's just full of grinding, so I guess the true question of
665020	666880	mine is, what are your thoughts on RuneScape?
666880	667880	I've never played it.
667880	672400	Also, whenever I see, Let's Have Tea screen name, I always think it says, Let's Shave
672400	673400	Tea.
673400	675360	But that doesn't matter.
675360	677360	How would you shave tea?
677360	680560	Tea leaves, maybe you shave them with a razor.
680560	683240	You and your logic.
683240	687440	So keep up the great work, Skydark, Sakura, and Loki, and I can't wait for the next podcast.
687440	690960	And that's from someone who didn't put their name on here.
690960	692960	So it's from person.
692960	697320	RuneScape, the only thing about it, I'm looking at some articles about it on Wikipedia, it
697320	698880	looks a little dated to me.
698880	700440	I've never played it.
700440	702480	But it's free, and free is always a good thing.
702480	703480	So it looks like...
703480	704840	No, free is not always a good thing.
704840	706600	I guess that's true, there was Yaris.
706600	707600	Yaris.
707600	708600	But this looks better than Yaris.
708600	710200	At least you can customize your equipment.
710200	711680	The characters look kind of funny.
711680	715800	Apparently there's 150 different RuneScape servers throughout the world.
715800	716800	It started in 2003.
716800	720280	No, no, I might have to check it out, it might be fun.
720280	721280	It's RuneScape.
721280	722560	Fuck RuneScape.
722560	723560	Why fuck RuneScape?
723560	725040	So you obviously know this game.
725040	726400	What do you think of RuneScape?
726400	729280	You get what you pay for.
729280	731320	Why don't you like it?
731320	735880	It's slow, it's clunky, it's a grindfest, and it has one of the worst communities I've
735880	738160	ever seen in a game, ever.
738160	741800	And it looks like it's set in the universe of Paperboy.
741800	744320	Based on that screenshot it does a little bit, huh?
744320	746320	Paperboy the MMO, that's pretty rad.
746320	748680	That would be awesome, I'd play it.
748680	750600	And then you go to the Crystal Castles and you're done.
750600	751600	Anyway.
751600	752600	Next email!
752600	753600	Okay!
753600	755600	Jeez, Rob, jeez.
755600	756600	Okay.
756600	758400	I like ordering the next email.
758400	760640	I think I'm going to do that from now on, I'm going to order the emails.
760640	763320	Yeah, watch me shove this ferret up your ass.
763320	764320	Ew.
764320	765320	This comes from...
765320	769560	No, I love the ferret, I wouldn't do that to the ferret.
769560	770560	Anyway.
770560	771560	It's a new segment.
771560	774560	I can't think of an introduction to my email except for holy crap.
774560	777680	I'm a bit scared about what happened to Rob, I hope you feel better, and that it wasn't
777680	779560	anything too serious.
779560	782040	Well, I feel better.
782040	788840	I just, if you want to do something for me, just cross your fingers, cross your toes,
788840	793640	pray if that's what you're into, or what have you, you know, light a candle or something
793640	795740	that it doesn't come back, and that it goes away.
795740	798840	Because honestly, that's the most scary thing about it, is that I still have a little bit
798840	803060	of those pains, and I'm hoping it's just on its way out, but I just don't want to go back
803060	804060	to the hospital.
804060	805060	This is a scary place.
805060	806060	Don't worry, Rob, we can help you.
806060	808840	We've played plenty of Trauma Center and we know what to do.
808840	813040	Remember, video games teach you about real life and shit, right?
813040	814040	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
814040	815040	Anyway.
815040	817080	Oh, hey, it's addressed to me.
817080	820500	Ragnarok Online 2 Gate of the World Private Servers are up.
820500	823560	The one I play on is euphro2.com.
823560	827300	It's e-u-p-h-r-o-2.com.
827300	831840	It runs off Korean beta software and only basic things are translated menus and such.
831840	834700	The soundtrack is also much better than the first Ragnarok.
834700	838360	The game is also completely different from the first as it runs in 3D, and you can change
838360	842640	classes whenever you want as long as your job level is over five, and the game runs
842640	846360	surprisingly a lot like World of Warcraft by interface and battle system.
846360	851760	The private server has two servers, a test that's 100, 100, 100 rate, and a main server,
851760	856200	I don't know what rates, assuming it has rates as their R01 server, 3, 3, 3.
856200	857200	Anyway.
857200	860960	It's from SakuraMax and it says, waiting for something amazing to happen.
860960	863880	I'm surprised you're not all over Ragnarok 2 if it's out there.
863880	866680	Not until I find a translated copy, like fully translated.
866680	869400	I mean, I'm going to look into this one tonight actually.
869400	870800	Sounds like soon though.
870800	874760	I'm going to look into this one because I'm very interested and I've read up a lot on
874760	879640	Ragnarok 2 already, but I had that, I tried to get into the official beta but I didn't
879640	882560	have a Korean social security number.
882560	885800	By the way, Cheeseburger sent me a private message commenting on RuneScape.
885800	890240	He said, I played one time someone was following me asking me for sex.
890240	891480	Wow.
891480	893320	I should be playing this game.
893320	894320	Sounds like fun.
894320	895320	Just kidding.
895320	896320	Wow.
896320	897320	Anyway.
897320	898320	Can I continue?
898320	899320	Yes.
899320	900320	Next email.
900320	901320	Okay.
901320	902320	Hey, OLR.
902320	905320	I have been listening since episode 245, which I don't know which one that is.
905320	910880	I just wanted to tell you how rad your podcast, your postcast, as it says.
910880	914980	I have laughed so many times listening to you guys and my ears do burn when you mention
914980	917500	anything to do with Australia.
917500	922760	Last year, Loki mentioned a mobile game called The Coolest Girl in School co-created by Champagne
922760	923760	for the Ladies.
923760	927040	I actually worked next door to Champagne for the Ladies doing freelance game artwork.
927040	928040	Nice.
928040	930760	Loki referred to it as GTA for Girls, LOL.
930760	932440	Keep up the good work, picks ill plays in.
932440	933440	And this is from Australia.
933440	935480	It's someone from Australia, so that's cool.
935480	939200	I'm glad we didn't offend all of our Australian listeners when we were, it's like it wasn't
939200	940240	a couple of weeks ago.
940240	944760	We just totally, somebody asked us like what the capital of Australia was, I don't remember
944760	945760	what the hell happened.
945760	947520	You asked me and I didn't know.
947520	948520	That's right.
948520	949520	Whatever.
949520	950520	It's not Sydney.
950520	951520	Maybe.
951520	952520	Remember that much.
952520	953520	It's all right.
953520	954520	It's all right.
954520	955520	I don't know my world capitals that well.
955520	957520	I know Australia, but that's because I'm part Australia.
957520	963360	Yeah, they're sad that there's a two-year-old on YouTube naming off capitals of countries
963360	965560	and all the states in the United States.
965560	966720	Well, you know what?
966720	967720	He's going to grow up to be a crackler.
967720	968720	And he's two years old.
968720	970720	Because seriously, where's that knowledge going to get you in life?
970720	973200	Are you smarter than a two-year-old?
973200	974200	Probably not.
974200	975200	Okay.
975200	977920	Hey guys, I was on YouTube last night and saw this video.
977920	978920	Yeah, okay.
978920	982360	It's the movie trailer for the movie The Legend of Zelda.
982360	986400	I know it's fake as you can see by the date at the end, but I wanted to know if this was
986400	989880	made into a movie, would you guys think it would be the most awesome thing in the world
989880	990880	or epic fail?
990880	991880	P.S.
991880	997960	When you guys are done doing this show in a really, really long time I hope, can I have
997960	998960	a ferret on eBay?
998960	999960	No.
999960	1002520	I guess we could eBay the ferret or something.
1002520	1003520	I don't know.
1003520	1005080	This is from Cheeseburger, by the way.
1005080	1007800	Did Cheeseburger get fooled by the April Fool's joke or did he say?
1007800	1008800	He said he realized it was a fake.
1008800	1009800	He said it was.
1009800	1010800	Oh, okay.
1010800	1013800	I would think they would have to do better.
1013800	1019160	It wasn't quite epic in its level of failure, but it was, yeah.
1019160	1023680	I thought it was decent enough that it proves that Zelda can have a movie made out of it
1023680	1025480	and it doesn't have to suck.
1025480	1028800	I mean if they actually poured some money into it, it could be Lord of the Rings-ish
1028800	1032640	epic, but they'd have to put some money and some star power and some writing and all that
1032640	1034600	good stuff and some special effects into it.
1034600	1037960	What do you think, Rice Princess, being the big Zelda fan you are, do you think that they
1037960	1039760	could actually make a movie out of Zelda?
1039760	1040760	Of course they can.
1040760	1042320	They can make a movie out of anything.
1042320	1043320	I guess that's true.
1043320	1044320	They do sometimes.
1044320	1047320	They're not well, but yeah.
1047320	1049080	The trailer, like I said, it was okay.
1049080	1053520	I mean for what it was, an April Fool's joke, it was good.
1053520	1056560	For a real movie, no, I wouldn't watch it.
1056560	1057560	Nice.
1057560	1058560	Yeah.
1058560	1060280	They should do an animated one.
1060280	1062280	It would be cool.
1062280	1064160	Here's a crazy idea I've always had.
1064160	1067600	I think the sci-fi network, you know how they sometimes do those random mini-series like
1067600	1073280	they did the Wizard of Oz thing not that long ago, and they're kind of low budget, but they're
1073280	1074280	decent, right?
1074280	1076160	Like a Lifetime movie?
1076160	1077160	Yeah.
1077160	1080920	I think they should do like a mini-series adapting one of the Final Fantasy games.
1080920	1083480	It sure is boring around here.
1083480	1087840	Now, Squeenix would never ever let them do it, but I don't know, they should.
1087840	1089640	It would be kind of cool.
1089640	1093400	The Spirits Within sure as hell wasn't a Final Fantasy movie.
1093400	1094400	It was a good movie.
1094400	1096400	It just wasn't Final Fantasy.
1096400	1100760	As this J-100 Matt would like to remind us, they did make a movie out of Good Burger,
1100760	1102960	so why not a movie for Legend of Zelda?
1102960	1103960	That's a good point.
1103960	1104960	Okay.
1104960	1107160	I'm going to keep going, all right?
1107160	1108160	Yes.
1108160	1109160	Next email.
1109160	1110160	This is from J-Rod.
1110160	1111160	Hey, guys.
1111160	1115560	I was just wondering if any of you have heard any news on the TNA Impact game.
1115560	1119960	I'm a huge wrestling fan, and there are droves of us who have left McMahon's stale product
1119960	1122000	and have gotten behind TNA.
1122000	1125600	Needless to say, we were thrilled when we found out there was a TNA game being developed
1125600	1127120	by Midway.
1127120	1130680	Last time I saw anything on it, they had motion capture videos up online, and the release
1130680	1132600	date was supposed to be sometime in spring.
1132600	1136640	Well, spring is here, and I haven't seen any press, previews, marketing, or anything about
1136640	1137640	it.
1137640	1141080	Have you guys or anyone in chat heard anything about this game, because I will be really
1141080	1143640	upset if it gets delayed or canned.
1143640	1145000	Thanks and keep up the awesome job.
1145000	1148720	This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.
1148720	1149720	June.
1149720	1152200	It's coming out in June.
1152200	1153200	Nice.
1153200	1155680	I don't follow wrestling stuff.
1155680	1159880	I'll get it if it has a custom mode in it, like a create a wrestler, because it's actually
1159880	1162600	the only fun thing I like about those games.
1162600	1163800	Oh, I didn't know this.
1163800	1169200	Sagan Chat says in response to my sci-fi network comment earlier, you do know that sci-fi was
1169200	1171440	in plans to make a Myst miniseries.
1171440	1174840	I did not know that, but that would be kind of rad.
1174840	1176400	Myst Online was interesting.
1176400	1180480	I'm kind of sad to see it go, but it took a lot of manpower to run that game, I think.
1180480	1181480	But Myst Online was creepy.
1181480	1184240	It was one of the creepiest MMOs I've ever played.
1184240	1186440	It made me think, what if Silent Hill was an MMO?
1186440	1187440	It would be like this.
1187440	1188440	That would be beautiful.
1188440	1192280	But then you'd have to take a psychological exam so it could bring up monsters based on
1192280	1193680	things out of your own psyche.
1193680	1198720	RocioUT would like to point out that Midway's website also lists the game being Summer 08.
1198720	1200680	There you have it.
1200680	1202080	Can I read the next email?
1202080	1203080	Next email!
1203080	1205640	It's freaking long, but I'm going to read it anyway.
1205640	1209480	And this email was sent by DidYouLoseASock.
1209480	1210480	No I didn't.
1210480	1211480	I didn't either.
1211480	1212480	They're in the house.
1212480	1213480	I'm not wearing them now.
1213480	1214480	I'm barefoot.
1214480	1215480	I'm naked.
1215480	1217480	My feet are naked.
1217480	1218480	Okay.
1218480	1219480	Next email.
1219480	1223600	I went to an advanced private screening of the movie Postal by Uwe Boll based off of
1223600	1228040	the video game of the same name, easily one of the worst films I have ever seen.
1228040	1231480	Uwe was at the screening and he was actually cool in real life.
1231480	1234840	Before showing the film, he talked about the reasons he made it and wanted to make a film
1234840	1239120	that he would like himself and did not care what critics or other people would think about
1239120	1240640	it and that's what he got.
1240640	1244080	He also commented on how the Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler movies are all the same and they
1244080	1246720	keep making them over and over again.
1246720	1252120	And about how the film 10,000 BC critics hated it 9% on Rotten Tomatoes, yet it made over
1252120	1256360	200 million worldwide because of the money put into the advertisements for the movie.
1256360	1259980	He also talked about how he is not the only one to do poor adaptations and pointed to
1259980	1262920	the films Electra and Catwoman.
1262920	1264400	Amen to that.
1264400	1267480	He talked about a few other problems with films in the film industry.
1267480	1271760	All the points he made were really great, but this film still sucked in the end.
1271760	1275800	Every religion and race he made fun of in this film, it was like a live action South
1275800	1279360	Park with crude humor and morals throughout.
1279360	1283080	Would the film have actually been good if everything was replaced with South Park characters?
1283080	1286400	Probably, but then again I think anything would be really funny if it was replaced by
1286400	1287940	South Park characters.
1287940	1289400	Is this film worth seeing?
1289400	1292600	It was so bad that some might find it good.
1292600	1297040	I might suggest this film over all those stupid spoof movies like Superhero Movie and Meet
1297040	1298040	the Spartans.
1298040	1305520	Ewey Bull in the past has boxed critics who would not like his films.
1305520	1310000	So after the film got over, of course, I did not like it, so I asked him to fake Punch
1310000	1315040	Me for a Photo, which he did and was a good sport about it.
1315040	1318600	Where I saw the film was a small private screening room that Ebert and Ripper and other media
1318600	1320120	people used to view films.
1320120	1324480	No major reporters were there, only smaller media outlets because of the status of the
1324480	1325480	film.
1325480	1327840	It was an amazing place and better than the film itself.
1327840	1328840	Spoiler warning!
1328840	1329840	Should I?
1329840	1330840	No one's going to see it.
1330840	1331840	Yeah, no one's going to see it.
1331840	1334120	I'm going to see it, but that's fine.
1334120	1335120	Here's the thing.
1335120	1339840	Reduce the volume on your iPod for about 15 seconds if you don't want to hear the spoiler.
1339840	1344920	The only slightly funny part in this film were Ewey Bull plays himself as a stereotypical
1344920	1347520	German dressed in lederhosen.
1347520	1351880	In the film he talks about how his films were funded by Nazi gold and then fights the creator
1351880	1355240	of Postal because he was mad at Ewey for ruining his game.
1355240	1358240	I give credit to someone who can make fun of themselves, and I think he included the
1358240	1359240	picture.
1359240	1362720	I'm trying to pull it up, but we did.
1362720	1363720	Nice.
1363720	1367440	There we go.
1367440	1368440	Very nice.
1368440	1369440	That's a good picture.
1369440	1370440	That's great.
1370440	1371440	That's a MySpace photo right there.
1371440	1373720	Wait, I got punched in the face by Ewey Bull.
1373720	1375200	Yeah, you should get that on a shirt.
1375200	1377880	You should actually print that on a shirt and say, I got punched in the face by Ewey
1377880	1378880	Bull.
1378880	1379880	Email.
1379880	1380880	Hold on real quick.
1380880	1382120	I got to say this comment from Black Wolf.
1382120	1384240	Black Wolf says, did you lose the sock in charity?
1384240	1387560	He's in chat, so have him link the photo.
1387560	1391280	Black Wolf says this, Ewey Bull stated in an interview that he knows about the petition
1391280	1393280	to get him to stop doing anything in movies.
1393280	1394800	It has 18,000 signatures.
1394800	1396120	He says that's not enough.
1396120	1399980	He says he'll consider leaving the industry if that petition gets one million signatures.
1399980	1405360	So what is more important, Loki as Tingle or Ewey Bull not in the film industry anymore?
1405360	1409880	You have a better chance of getting him to leave the film industry than me to dress up
1409880	1410880	as Tingle.
1410880	1411880	Oh, snap.
1411880	1416800	Because at least signatures don't cost anything.
1416800	1418080	That's true.
1418080	1420600	True that.
1420600	1421600	Last email.
1421600	1422600	Last email.
1422600	1423600	Hi, OLR.
1423600	1427240	I'm a loyal podcast listener and wanted to tell you how much I like your show.
1427240	1428240	Well, thank you.
1428240	1430880	Your show makes me happy and Loki's runs always make me laugh.
1430880	1435440	In fact, you guys make me laugh so much that I've gotten used to awkward steers in public.
1435440	1437760	Thanks for making such a great show and please keep it up.
1437760	1439800	This is from Able to Think.
1439800	1440800	There's more.
1440800	1441800	P.S.
1441800	1445120	Dark Sakura, I know how much you love treasure, so I thought I'd let you know that the bleach
1445120	1447480	fighting game on DS is made by them.
1447480	1448480	Ooh.
1448480	1449480	P.P.S.
1449480	1450480	An interesting question.
1450480	1451940	I'd like to hear your answers.
1451940	1455920	A woman while at the funeral of her mother met a man who she did not know.
1455920	1457280	She thought he was amazing.
1457280	1460720	She believed him to be her dream partner so much that she fell in love with him right
1460720	1465160	then and there but never asked for his phone number or address and could not find him after
1465160	1466160	the funeral.
1466160	1468540	A few days later, she killed her sister.
1468540	1470600	So the question.
1470600	1472480	What was the woman's motive for killing her sister?
1472480	1474680	Now think about it.
1474680	1478480	Why would you think that she would kill her sister?
1478480	1479480	I don't know.
1479480	1480480	Do I care?
1480480	1481480	Anybody?
1481480	1484000	Dr. Phil made her do it.
1484000	1485000	I'm sorry.
1485000	1486240	I wasn't listening.
1486240	1489040	So she can see the guy again?
1489040	1490040	Okay.
1490040	1491040	Answer.
1491040	1494040	She was hoping the man would appear again at her sister's funeral.
1494040	1496200	If you answer this correctly, you think like a psychopath.
1496200	1497840	Oh, I've heard that thing before.
1497840	1501880	This was a test used by a famous American psychologist to test if someone has the same
1501880	1503440	mentality as a killer.
1503440	1507360	Several incarcerated serial killers took part in the test and all answered the question
1507360	1508360	correctly.
1508360	1510600	If you didn't answer the question correctly, good for you.
1510600	1513880	If you gave the correct answer, please let me know so I can keep an eye on you.
1513880	1519040	And then like when they're interviewing someone, so what was the motive?
1519040	1520040	I don't know.
1520040	1522340	And then they stabbed him in the face.
1522340	1525800	Let me tell you about my mother.
1525800	1529280	Or you could just be good at logical deduction.
1529280	1531880	You don't have to think like a psychopath.
1531880	1538080	You can just think it out.
1538080	1540080	That was the last email, right?
1540080	1541080	Yes.
1541080	1542520	That was the last email.
1542520	1545880	By the way, kids, we have a list list coming up tonight.
1545880	1549000	Things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
1549000	1554440	I need everybody in studio to do a list of three things.
1554440	1556480	But there's too many, we only can only do five.
1556480	1557480	Yeah, I figured that much.
1557480	1559240	So Irene and Nathan, you guys can combine a list.
1559240	1563400	So think a list of three things, things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
1563400	1564840	Does anybody need cards to write things down?
1564840	1565840	Because I have little cards.
1565840	1566840	Yes.
1566840	1567840	I would like a card, Rob.
1567840	1568840	Here you go.
1568840	1569840	Here's a card.
1569840	1570840	Here you go.
1570840	1571840	Thank you very much.
1571840	1572840	There you go.
1572840	1573840	Do you have a pen or a pencil?
1573840	1574840	You can borrow mine, but you've got to give them both.
1574840	1575840	Oh, we have a pencil.
1575840	1576840	Okay, good.
1576840	1577840	Never mind.
1577840	1578840	But thank you very much, Rob.
1578840	1579840	This is great radio, by the way.
1579840	1580840	I know.
1580840	1581840	I'm trying to fill time.
1581840	1582840	Back to the news, please.
1582840	1583840	All right.
1583840	1587360	I was going to say this is finally launched, but guess what?
1587360	1590720	N-Gage is back, bitches.
1590720	1591720	That's right.
1591720	1595360	The N-Gage application has finally launched.
1595360	1606320	And it is compatible with Nokia's N81, N81 8 gigabyte, N82, N95, N95 8 gigabyte phones.
1606320	1610840	And there are five games right now currently available for it, Brain Challenge, System
1610840	1616560	Rush Evolution, and World Series of Poker, and I guess two other ones.
1616560	1622000	And then all the other games, or all the games it gets offered free trials, and then can
1622000	1628080	be purchased straight from a computer once you create an N-Gage account.
1628080	1634880	And some new games coming at some point, Worms World Party, and Sims 2 Pets, and of course
1634880	1638040	Tetris.
1638040	1639440	I don't know.
1639440	1641320	I guess that's kind of neat.
1641320	1642320	Maybe?
1642320	1643320	No?
1643320	1644320	Chirp, chirp.
1644320	1645320	Chirp, chirp.
1645320	1648040	I mean, it is the N-Gage.
1648040	1649040	Quick poll.
1649040	1651920	We're going to do a quick poll in chat right now, okay?
1651920	1655880	I just want you guys to answer with yes or no.
1655880	1658960	Do you care about the N-Gage?
1658960	1660200	Chat room, answer now.
1660200	1661200	No.
1661200	1662200	We'll do this next story.
1662200	1663200	Do you care about the N-Gage?
1663200	1664200	That is the whole chat room.
1664200	1665200	All right, let's see.
1665200	1666200	Spoken on behalf of them.
1666200	1668320	I'm just going to see while I read this next story.
1668320	1670040	This is something people might care about.
1670040	1672520	Saints Row 2 is coming out on August 26th.
1672520	1674080	Are you excited about this, Loki?
1674080	1675080	Fuck yeah.
1675080	1676980	Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
1676980	1680560	This was announced at the THQ Gamer's Day, which was in San Francisco earlier this week.
1680560	1681560	We get invited to those fuckers.
1681560	1683120	Yeah, we never do.
1683120	1685680	There is a Saints Row 2 website now up and running.
1685680	1687520	It's at saintsrow.com.
1687520	1690220	Not saintsrow2.com, it's saintsrow.com.
1690220	1696640	And the timing of it is between Grand Theft Auto IV and Christmas, so it's a pretty good
1696640	1697640	time.
1697640	1703400	We have it, Saints Row 2, August 26th, which is about two years after the game originally
1703400	1704400	came out, I think.
1704400	1706400	Loki is probably already pre-ordered.
1706400	1710440	I will be buying this for sure, which is kind of cool, though.
1710440	1713080	They have a whole set of trailers that they're starting to run.
1713080	1718740	I know you can view them on IGN and probably some other places, with Uncle Gary talking
1718740	1722360	about different aspects of the game that are new to Saints Row 2.
1722360	1727540	And of course, for those who aren't aware, Uncle Gary is Gary Busey, so it is pretty
1727540	1728680	funny.
1728680	1731800	But there are some new things, especially if you've been reading any of the previews
1731800	1733040	on there.
1733040	1737440	There's sticky satchel charges that you can throw on people and detonate them remotely,
1737440	1740800	and then you can actually throw people in this game.
1740800	1747120	And there's different taunts you can do, including, I believe you can teabag someone in this game.
1747120	1748120	Lovely.
1748120	1749680	Here's the results of our quick poll.
1749680	1751280	Do you care about the engage?
1751280	1752280	Here we go.
1752280	1753280	No.
1753280	1754280	No.
1754280	1755280	No.
1755280	1756280	No.
1756280	1757280	No.
1757280	1758280	No.
1758280	1759280	No.
1759280	1760280	No.
1760280	1761280	No.
1761280	1762280	No.
1762280	1763280	No.
1763280	1764280	No.
1764280	1765280	No.
1765280	1766280	No.
1766280	1767280	No Industry.
1767280	1768280	No.
1768280	1769280	No.
1769280	1770280	Yes.
1770280	1771280	Kinda.
1771280	1772280	Yes.
1772280	1773280	No.
1773280	1774280	No.
1774280	1775280	The what?
1775280	1776280	Yes, it's a no.
1776280	1777280	No.
1777280	1778280	No.
1778280	1779280	No.
1779280	1780280	Uh, blackwolf clarifies his kindness, saying, Some of the games I saw for the new Engage
1780280	1781360	platform had some neat ideas.
1781360	1782760	So kinda.
1782760	1788420	And lastly as Mae Satsuma says, the only N-Gage I care about was the one from Star Trek The
1788420	1789420	Next Generation.
1789420	1790420	No, God, why?
1790420	1791420	You love that joke, right?
1791420	1797760	Chat comment of the night, I love it.
1797760	1798760	That's my favorite.
1798760	1799760	You win.
1799760	1800800	So there you have it.
1800800	1801800	The results of the quick poll.
1801800	1802880	I answered the poll, too.
1802880	1804200	Live radio is awesome.
1804200	1805200	Yes, it is.
1805200	1806560	What did you say, Dark Sagra?
1806560	1807560	Pod may know.
1807560	1810000	All right, look.
1810000	1813120	Story please, Dark Sagra.
1813120	1817520	OK, OK, OK.
1817520	1819360	Oh yeah, it would help if I actually could find it.
1819360	1820360	OK, there we go.
1820360	1823960	Gran Turismo PSP, who cares?
1823960	1825840	OK, some people do.
1825840	1833240	It's actually delayed until 2009, yeah.
1833240	1837600	It should be noted that it's actually called Duke Nukem Forever's Gran Turismo for the
1837600	1840360	PSP.
1840360	1845840	I call it, you know, you've got prologue, I guess?
1845840	1846840	Doesn't matter.
1846840	1851240	Yeah, it's funny, though, because they were showing this thing off, like, I want to see
1851240	1853240	before the PSP came out.
1853240	1856160	Wasn't it one of the things that they were saying, hey, yeah, it's going to be so awesome.
1856160	1859280	Yeah, I thought they were talking about Ridge Racer, though.
1859280	1861280	Didn't happen.
1861280	1865820	Oh, well, so sad.
1865820	1875200	So something that may happen, it's interesting, actually, apparently we're not the only people
1875200	1882800	out there that sent out stories that later retracted, IGN had some interesting stuff.
1882800	1885440	It happens to the best of us.
1885440	1888040	IGN had a few things.
1888040	1893080	First, their story about a game called Skate It coming out for the DS and the Wii, that's
1893080	1898000	right, that's a version of the game put out by EA that will be coming to the Nintendo
1898000	1900280	platforms.
1900280	1908040	No word on when exactly it will be coming out, of course, the information was very brief,
1908040	1915640	but they did say that, you know, they were talking about using, of course, the Wii remote
1915640	1921520	motion control for the game and stuff like that, but then later, they retracted that
1921520	1923280	and actually pulled the entire story.
1923280	1930560	But thanks to the magic of Google cache, you can actually still view that article.
1930560	1934280	And you know what's better than spoiling one game?
1934280	1940920	Spoiling two games, because IGN did the same damn thing with an upcoming Batman game.
1940920	1942900	The story was pulled.
1942900	1946720	There was not a lot of details on the game, it was pretty much, I guess, just a generic
1946720	1951260	kind of blank page that just indicated there was a Batman game coming, but, you know, you
1951260	1959400	could probably put two and two together and figure that it was a Dark Knight adaptation.
1959400	1964840	And keep in mind, Pandemic is the company that made Destroy All Humans and Mercenaries
1964840	1968120	and Pandemic was the company that was slated to make this Batman game.
1968120	1969120	So what do you think of that?
1969120	1970960	The folks making Destroy All Humans and making Batman?
1970960	1976000	It could be okay, Destroy All Humans has kind of been lost its edge since, like, the first
1976000	1981560	games lost its edge, but Mercenaries 2 looks fucking awesome.
1981560	1984440	I had a friend that worked on that.
1984440	1989200	It's interesting though, here's what they had, actually someone had copied this from
1989200	1996720	the Neo GAF forums, it said, never one to turn down a good movie tie-in, by the way,
1996720	1997920	of a brand new video game.
1997920	2003520	IGN has learned that EA has indeed tapped Pandemic to create a new Batman title.
2003520	2009420	We first reported this as a strong rumor back in May of 2007, but now we know it's happening
2009420	2010420	for sure.
2010420	2015520	Elevation Partners, who were owners of Pandemic and BioWare until the EA purchase had gained
2015520	2019920	the video game rights to the franchise, we rumored last year that EA would publish the
2019920	2025320	title, but now EA owns the aforementioned companies and the publishing aspect was a
2025320	2026320	given.
2026320	2029640	Unfortunately we don't have any specific platform, a release date, or even an official title,
2029640	2034080	but given EA's history, we'd expect a game to be called The Dark Knight released this
2034080	2038920	July alongside the film, and to hit just about every platform known to humankind.
2038920	2041940	I can tell you right now it's probably not coming out in July, but as you say it seems
2041940	2047140	a bit late, but if they are developing something like that, it could also come out around the
2047140	2049320	release of the movie on DVD.
2049320	2052360	That's what I'm thinking, more DVD Blu-ray time.
2052360	2054280	Which would be around the fourth quarter I'd imagine.
2054280	2055280	Probably Christmas.
2055280	2058960	But I don't even know if that would make it in time, if it's not in development.
2058960	2062600	I'm curious to see how they would tastefully handle the whole Heath Ledger thing.
2062600	2070660	Well, EA actually did the last Batman game I think, so it makes sense.
2070660	2074600	Some of the Batman games really kick ass, like the old school Batman on the NES was
2074600	2075600	one of the best games.
2075600	2076600	Oh that was fun.
2076600	2077600	That was one of the best games on the NES.
2077600	2078600	Heck yeah.
2078600	2080040	Batman Returns was kind of wonky.
2080040	2081360	I didn't play it.
2081360	2083080	First Batman was pretty awesome.
2083080	2084080	Yeah.
2084080	2085080	So.
2085080	2086080	Again.
2086080	2088600	There are good movie adaptation games once in a great, great while.
2088600	2089600	Okay.
2089600	2090600	List list coming up.
2090600	2091600	I hope you guys have your list soon.
2091600	2096120	It's coming right up after one more story, which is Jamie's story.
2096120	2098720	Yes it is.
2098720	2105440	Samsung is bringing different games out for their smartphones and one of them is Second
2105440	2107320	Life.
2107320	2115040	So basically they're actually showing it, the CTIA wireless thing that was going on
2115040	2122700	where you can access it using the smartphones and, you know, talk through a text in SMS.
2122700	2128440	So it said that they want to launch it in the second half of this year.
2128440	2132600	All righty.
2132600	2136640	It's going to be interesting though if you can have that crack with you where it's Furries
2136640	2138080	Portable is what it is.
2138080	2139080	Right Drew?
2139080	2140080	Furries Portable.
2140080	2141080	All right.
2141080	2142080	Okay.
2142080	2143880	Here's the deal guys.
2143880	2145280	We're going to play a little game.
2145280	2150920	We have been playing since our first couple episodes here on Live 365 right on down to
2150920	2153240	the very last episode on Live 365.
2153240	2159440	It's a segment we call Listless.
2159440	2160800	Tonight's Listless.
2160800	2165540	The topic is things Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
2165540	2167000	It's been a little while since we've done Listless.
2167000	2168520	It's at least been a few months.
2168520	2171800	Some of our games only show up once every few months.
2171800	2172800	Here's the deal.
2172800	2175680	This is that we're going to go around the room and each person is going to name their
2175680	2180600	top three, one at a time, things that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
2180600	2182680	Is everybody done with their list?
2182680	2187480	If anyone is still in need of suggestions, chat room, you can try to influence us now.
2187480	2192040	If you have a good idea for things Live 365 could do to get us to stay, start posting
2192040	2197200	those suggestions in chat now and maybe a host or a guest will pick up on it.
2197200	2201520	But then after the list is made, so we'll get a big list that has one, two, three, four,
2201520	2205480	and fifteen things on it, then we're going to go around and we each take one thing off
2205480	2206480	the list.
2206480	2208240	We vote something off the list.
2208240	2209360	It's off the island, okay?
2209360	2210360	No more.
2210360	2215640	So it's off the list and then the chat room will take that list of ten and vote on their
2215640	2220200	favorite and we will come up with a definitive list of things Live 365 could do to get us
2220200	2221200	to stay.
2221200	2226520	Participating tonight, DarkSakura, myself, Loki, Drew, and so that we don't have too
2226520	2231440	many people, Bryce Princess and SilentNathan, I think it's going to be his new name, Silent
2231440	2236280	Bob, SilentNathan, are going to be combined as one person because they're a couple and
2236280	2237280	you can do that to couples.
2237280	2238280	Oh my God, that's so cute.
2238280	2242200	Aw, what do you think of that, SilentNathan?
2242200	2243200	That's what I thought.
2243200	2244200	All right.
2244200	2246720	I'm just giving him a hard time.
2246720	2249040	It's because his girlfriend hogs the mic.
2249040	2250040	All right.
2250040	2251040	What do you mean?
2251040	2252040	I don't hog the mic.
2252040	2253040	You shut up now.
2253040	2256280	All right, here we go.
2256280	2257540	Let's start off the list.
2257540	2260560	We'll start tonight with Drew.
2260560	2265280	What is your number three thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay?
2265280	2270080	Ferret radio, all ferret all the time.
2270080	2272160	All ferret radio, all ferret all the time.
2272160	2274800	I don't know if I've ever fucking listened to that, but it might work.
2274800	2282520	All right, all ferret radio, Bryce Princess and SilentNathan, your number three pick.
2282520	2289280	Provide the studio via Irene a unicorn.
2289280	2292000	Provide the studio a unicorn via Irene.
2292000	2294840	Oh, that's the important part of House of Beatle and Yuck.
2294840	2295840	I like that idea.
2295840	2296840	Me too.
2296840	2297840	I think a unicorn would be fun.
2297840	2298840	It would be great.
2298840	2299840	I think that would give me a stay.
2299840	2306160	I'd stay with Live 365 if they gave me a unicorn and leave like six months later, but you know.
2306160	2307160	What do you have, the unicorn?
2307160	2308600	Do I have to feed it?
2308600	2310080	I hope they provide food too.
2310080	2314400	I'm pretty sure unicorns are like self-sufficient because they're like magical and shit.
2314400	2315400	Unicorns eat children.
2315400	2316400	Yeah, see?
2316400	2318400	We've got millions of them here.
2318400	2320480	All right, let's see what happens.
2320480	2324800	I'm just curious what Bobby Blackwolf thinks of this whole segment.
2324800	2329920	I'm seeing if he suggested anything because, you know, it could change.
2329920	2336000	We may have to pull out of the deal if Live 365 is able to provide a unicorn, we might
2336000	2337000	have to pull out.
2337000	2339000	Well, let's see what some of the other things are on the list.
2339000	2341320	Dark Soccer, we'll go to you next.
2341320	2342720	Number three, your number three pick.
2342720	2347520	Pay for me to relocate to England.
2347520	2348520	Just you?
2348520	2349520	Yes.
2349520	2352600	Okay, me and the people of my choice.
2352600	2360640	Okay, sorry, I am slow.
2360640	2364920	I'm typing as we do this here, so it takes me a minute.
2364920	2367520	All right, sorry, filler.
2367520	2368520	Thank you.
2368520	2369520	Irene, sing.
2369520	2372040	When we need little filler, you need to sing, okay?
2372040	2373040	I can dance, I can sing.
2373040	2376040	Well, that's why we have the theme music too, so there's something to listen to.
2376040	2378200	Me, your number three pick.
2378200	2383240	I would like Ken Kutaragi's heart on a platter.
2383240	2384240	Kalima!
2384240	2385240	Kalima!
2385240	2387800	I'm sorry, we can't do that.
2387800	2388800	We're out of platters.
2388800	2389800	That's sick.
2389800	2391800	You're sick.
2391800	2395120	I bet you got that serial killer question right.
2395120	2396920	Ken Kutaragi's heart on a platter.
2396920	2397920	Oh, God.
2397920	2398920	Lawsuit in the air.
2398920	2399920	All right, sue Live 365.
2399920	2400920	Don't sue us.
2400920	2401920	All right.
2401920	2402920	Obviously, he's joking.
2402920	2403920	All right.
2403920	2411560	Oh, I love what the chat room suggests.
2411560	2415480	I'm going to read that later after what we get here.
2415480	2416480	All right.
2416480	2417480	My number three thing.
2417480	2418480	Here it is.
2418480	2421280	The number three thing Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
2421280	2426040	Force compile to reform and make a sequel to the guardian legend.
2426040	2427520	Yes.
2427520	2430000	Dot com.
2430000	2436720	If Live 365 wants us to stay, they will force compile to get back together and make a sequel
2436720	2437720	to the guardian legend.
2437720	2438720	I don't know.
2438720	2439720	At gunpoint.
2439720	2440720	However, they have to do it.
2440720	2441720	But that's the only way we're staying.
2441720	2442720	All right.
2442720	2443720	Here we go.
2443720	2448120	The number two way that Live 365 can get us to stay.
2448120	2449520	We'll start with Drew.
2449520	2452680	Make tuner software that doesn't suck.
2452680	2454720	Make tuner software that doesn't suck.
2454720	2459240	Radio 365, I'm looking at you.
2459240	2464920	Why do you think that I was using the Sam 2 broadcaster?
2464920	2465920	All right.
2465920	2466920	Nice.
2466920	2472960	Irene and Silent Nathan, what is the number three, I'm sorry, number two thing that Live
2472960	2475080	365 could do to get us to stay?
2475080	2480960	Blow jobs for everyone.
2480960	2483640	That was my number one answer.
2483640	2487280	My number one was blow me.
2487280	2489160	Now I'm going to have to change that you asshole.
2489160	2490160	That's okay.
2490160	2491160	I'm stealing a great one from Chet.
2491160	2492160	All right.
2492160	2493160	Let's see.
2493160	2496000	Dark Sakura, you're number two.
2496000	2505120	My number two, that would be to pay me $100,000 a year to do Warren Jones radio.
2505120	2506120	That's a nice salary.
2506120	2508120	By me, I mean us each.
2508120	2509120	Okay.
2509120	2510120	Us each.
2510120	2511120	Pay $100,000 a year.
2511120	2513120	And guests get like $5,000 a visit.
2513120	2514120	An appearance.
2514120	2515120	All right.
2515120	2516120	They get to touch us.
2516120	2517120	They get royalties.
2517120	2518120	All right.
2518120	2521760	That's actually your number two thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
2521760	2526640	I was going to say, give me the motherfucking movie check, but because we didn't do a movie,
2526640	2527640	motherfucking radio check.
2527640	2531560	I guess that kind of is the same thing as what she said.
2531560	2532560	Is that a reference?
2532560	2533560	All right.
2533560	2534560	Here's mine.
2534560	2535560	Here's mine.
2535560	2536560	Okay.
2536560	2538560	Pay us $200,000 a year to do Orson Trejo.
2538560	2544560	That was actually my original number three.
2544560	2545560	I'm serious.
2545560	2546560	Lovely.
2546560	2547560	All right.
2547560	2551800	Pay $200,000 a year to do Orson Trejo immediately followed by pay $200,000 a year to do Orson
2551800	2552800	Trejo.
2552800	2553800	Beautiful.
2553800	2557640	Number two thing from my list that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
2557640	2560640	Heal my pancreas.
2560640	2562040	They could do that with a unicorn.
2562040	2565960	We need to play you the Weird Al song over and over and over again until your pancreas
2565960	2569320	go, okay, fine.
2569320	2570320	Heal my pancreas.
2570320	2574320	The number two thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
2574320	2580400	All right, yeah, Dark Sakura, heal please.
2580400	2581400	Bite my ass, please.
2581400	2582400	I'm in battle, dammit.
2582400	2583400	Here we go.
2583400	2586720	It's down to the number ones on our list.
2586720	2591120	Drew, your number one thing that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
2591120	2592680	Give Jamie a cookie.
2592680	2595160	Ooh, I like cookies.
2595160	2596160	Give Jamie a cookie.
2596160	2598200	How about give Jamie pastrami?
2598200	2599840	I like pastrami better.
2599840	2600840	All right.
2600840	2602840	Oh, give Jamie a pastrami cookie.
2602840	2609080	All right, Rice Princess and Silent Nathan, did you come to a consensus?
2609080	2612280	What is your number one thing that Live 365 could do to get you to stay?
2612280	2616400	This is a complete consensus between me and Irene.
2616400	2624960	Go back in time and make Rob not retarded so that he'll vote for Chrono Trigger.
2624960	2629160	Referencing tonight's bonus segment, we were talking about OLR March Madness just so the
2629160	2633960	podcast listeners know, I cast the deciding vote between Super Metroid and Chrono Trigger.
2633960	2640000	So all right, I have to shorten that though for the sake of pencil space to make Rob vote
2640000	2641000	for Chrono Trigger.
2641000	2642000	No, you don't.
2642000	2643000	No, no, no.
2643000	2644000	You can type that all out, Rob.
2644000	2649200	You leave that intact, Mr. Rob.
2649200	2650200	Hold on.
2650200	2651200	You better sing.
2651200	2663840	All right, good enough, I put go back in time and make Rob not retarded and vote for Chrono
2663840	2664840	Trigger.
2664840	2669560	All right, Dark Sakura, your number one thing on the list.
2669560	2673600	Not a damn thing they've done fucked up.
2673600	2675080	Good answer.
2675080	2677300	I think that's our winner right there.
2677300	2679520	Not a damn thing they've done fucked up.
2679520	2681960	That's Dark Sakura's number one answer.
2681960	2684000	Loki, your number one answer.
2684000	2687720	I was going to go with George Fore and the Full Cow Grilling Machine.
2687720	2692440	Oh, you mean the PS3?
2692440	2693440	This isn't my choice.
2693440	2696600	I'm sure this is for the chat room because I sure as hell wouldn't want to see this happen,
2696600	2704880	but purchase one million copies of the Eye of Judgment.
2704880	2707680	Somebody check this man for a fever.
2707680	2708680	God damn it.
2708680	2710080	I was going to steal, you ass.
2710080	2713240	All right, then put in George Fore and Full Cow Grilling Machine.
2713240	2714520	No, it's too late.
2714520	2718760	You said purchase one million copies of Eye of Judgment is Loki's number one.
2718760	2723040	All right, so if Life is Five purchases one million copies of Eye of Judgment, then we'll
2723040	2726560	stay and we'll have much LOL with it.
2726560	2730980	All right, my number one, my number one would be the thing that Life is Five could do to
2730980	2732980	get us to stay.
2732980	2736480	Buy us a George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine.
2736480	2747680	There you go.
2747680	2752080	If you might remember, I think the last time we did this was for the Consumer Electronics
2752080	2755640	Show, Things We Most Want to See at Consumer Electronics Show.
2755640	2761960	One of the answers was buy us a George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine that actually grills
2761960	2764400	the entire cow.
2764400	2765400	I don't know if that one.
2765400	2766400	Buy us a George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine that actually grills the entire cow
2766400	2767400	and cures the leather.
2767400	2772360	All right, here it is, the list of 15 as it is so far.
2772360	2778320	All Ferret Radio, provide a unicorn via Irene, pay for dark soccer and the people of her
2778320	2783600	choice to go to England, Ken Kutaragi's heart on a platter, force a sequel to the guardian
2783600	2790200	legend, make tuner software that doesn't suck, blow jobs for everyone, pay $100,000 a year
2790200	2799600	to do OLR, pay $200,000 a year to do OLR, heal Rob's pancreas, gift Jamie a cookie,
2799600	2804800	go back in time and make Rob not retarded and vote for Chrono Trigger, not a damn thing,
2804800	2810040	they done fucked up, purchase 1 million copies of Eye of Judgment and buy us a George Foreman
2810040	2811440	Full Cow Grilling Machine.
2811440	2813080	Damn it, this is hard.
2813080	2815040	This is a good list.
2815040	2818600	I thought this would be kind of a dumb segment tonight, but we did a good job.
2818600	2821040	Do you really have to remove some?
2821040	2822680	That's the game, I'm sorry to say.
2822680	2824880	All right, we're going to go the same way.
2824880	2829120	Drunami, we'll start with you, which one of these items is not worthy of the list?
2829120	2830800	The $100,000 a year.
2830800	2832320	I knew someone had to do that.
2832320	2835800	Pay $100,000 a year to do OLR is off the list.
2835800	2841840	All right, Rice Princess and Silent Nathan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
2841840	2844600	Pay $200,000 a year.
2844600	2847240	Damn, throw the baby out with a bath water, there they go.
2847240	2850920	It's not like money or something.
2850920	2855200	I put it in there that's paying $5,000 each minute.
2855200	2858720	Nathan's more interested in blowjobs for everyone, all right?
2858720	2860720	All right, who's next?
2860720	2863400	Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
2863400	2864400	All Ferret Radio.
2864400	2865400	All Ferret Radio.
2865400	2867400	Because we have that anyway.
2867400	2868400	Fucking mommy.
2868400	2872440	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
2872440	2875800	I know this is going to sound weird, but blowjobs for everyone, because who knows who's giving
2875800	2876800	those blowjobs?
2876800	2877800	That could be some scary shit.
2877800	2881640	Yeah, have you ever watched Cat House Girls?
2881640	2882640	No.
2882640	2885240	This could be some scary stuff.
2885240	2888040	It could be Air Force, Amy.
2888040	2890800	All right, my turn.
2890800	2895160	We have Provide a Unicorn, Pay for Dark Sakura to go to England, Ken Kuroi, He's Hard on
2895160	2898680	a Platter, Force the Sequel to Guardian Legend, Make Tuner Software Doesn't Suck, Heal Rob's

2902680	2906040	a Damn Thing, Purchase One Many Copies of Eye Judgment, and Buy Us George Foreman Full
2906040	2912400	Cow Girly Machine, the one I deem not worthy of the list, Ken Kudaragi's Heart on a Platter,
2912400	2916640	because that's kind of sick.
2916640	2920600	Here is the list that you in chat can vote for.
2920600	2927400	You're going to send me, Sky, a private message in chat with your top two in order.
2927400	2931680	It's important because your first pick actually gets two votes, okay?
2931680	2938000	Here is the list as it stands, and I'm about to paste a big thing into chat, so brace yourselves.
2938000	2940440	Here we go.
2940440	2941440	As Rob gets kicked from chat.
2941440	2943520	No, I won't get kicked from chat, okay?
2943520	2944520	Here we go.
2944520	2946120	Here is the list as it stands.

2986920	2988720	substitute for the Skype line tonight.
2988720	2995040	In the meantime, more stories and I will start it off with a little story about Pinball FX.
2995040	2999280	And Jamie did touch on this a little bit earlier in part A, but there is a Rocky and Boinkle
2999280	3002400	table on the way to Pinball FX.
3002400	3008360	It's going to cost you 200 Microsoft points and apparently it is available now.
3008360	3009480	I'm going to have to get it.
3009480	3013840	Here's the thing though, it is not the Data East original.
3013840	3015200	That's why I have to get it.
3015200	3017960	So it is apparently though not too shabby.
3017960	3022800	It's got ramps, mini games, and it is a Rocky and Boinkle game.
3022800	3025760	You get Boris, Natasha, Moose and Squirrel.
3025760	3027100	You get it all.
3027100	3028100	It's all right there.
3028100	3030000	So that came out on April 3rd.
3030000	3032600	So I didn't even realize that it had come out this week, but that was one of the days
3032600	3033600	I was in the hospital.
3033600	3034600	So I must have missed it.
3034600	3035600	Wait.
3035600	3038840	So do you get all the Mr. Peabody and stuff too?
3038840	3039840	Yes.
3039840	3040840	Mr. Peabody, Sherman.
3040840	3041840	They're all in there.
3041840	3042840	Really?
3042840	3047400	I have to tell you a bit of trivia though about the Data East machine.
3047400	3050960	The picture of the Wayback machine, right next to it is the DeLorean from Back to the
3050960	3054040	Future on the play field.
3054040	3055040	Awesome.
3055040	3056040	Nice.
3056040	3057040	All right.
3057040	3058040	I'm going to have to check that out.
3058040	3061280	I didn't realize that had come out, but I do have Pinball FX and I would like some more
3061280	3062280	tables for it.
3062280	3063480	So I'm definitely going to check that out.
3063480	3066800	So I'm glad we do this show because I missed a lot of gaming news while I was out.
3066800	3067800	All right.
3067800	3068800	Let's move on with the gaming news.
3068800	3069800	We are tallying some votes.
3069800	3073200	Oh, that would be my turn, wouldn't it?
3073200	3074680	I think so.
3074680	3082600	Well, there is a talk about a game called Velociraptor Safari coming out to the iPhone.
3082600	3083980	And you know what?
3083980	3088740	As much as I appreciate iPhone gaming and what they're doing with it, I don't think
3088740	3092680	I would find it in my heart to play Velociraptor Safari.
3092680	3093680	Fuck that shit.
3093680	3094680	Bring us Jambo Safari.
3094680	3095680	Bring us Jambo Safari.
3095680	3097840	You haven't played Velociraptor Safari then?
3097840	3098840	It's fun.
3098840	3099840	Is it?
3099840	3100840	How fun is it?
3100840	3101840	Do you get to kill them?
3101840	3102840	Yes.
3102840	3103840	You have a giant spiky chain.
3103840	3104840	I will kill a Velociraptor.
3104840	3108320	You have a spiky chain that you catch the Velociraptor with and you have to pull them
3108320	3110640	through a portal type thing.
3110640	3114040	This is like Jambo Safari with Velociraptors.
3114040	3120140	It's actually, it's a web game, of course, and what they did is made the client compatible
3120140	3121140	with the iPhone.
3121140	3122140	This is flasher as hell.
3122140	3125080	No cost to you, which is awesome.
3125080	3128360	Well, maybe I'll have to give it a go.
3128360	3129360	Maybe.
3129360	3130360	I don't know.
3130360	3134920	I'm too busy listening to American Idol on YouTube.
3134920	3142320	Well, there is some new developments now in the world of PS3 piracy.
3142320	3146680	Unfortunately, there is now a PS3 backup launcher.
3146680	3152480	The problem is though, it's still in alpha and it only works on PS3 dev stations, but
3152480	3157240	what it allows you to do is boot PS3 games from the hard drive, boot games from a DVD
3157240	3165200	or Blu-ray disc drive, copy original PS3 games from said optical drive to the hard drive,
3165200	3170040	and patch executables on some games to run from the hard drive.
3170040	3175680	So I don't know, it's a matter of time, I guess, before this becomes as vulnerable as
3175680	3178720	say the PSP, which isn't good.
3178720	3184560	But I can imagine though that a lot of people probably wouldn't want to copy a 50 gig game
3184560	3186240	to their hard drive.
3186240	3187240	That would probably suck.
3187240	3188240	All right.
3188240	3193440	Sorry, I'm in the middle of tallying votes.
3193440	3195840	We had a lot of votes tonight, by the way.
3195840	3200940	If you want to vote, this is your last chance to vote in tonight's list list, things Live
3200940	3203840	365 could do to get us to stay.
3203840	3208040	One more story before we get to some last minute stories.
3208040	3212600	I figured this would be an appropriate story since OLR is always dedicated to giving you
3212600	3217540	the current in gaming news and staying on top of what's going on in the scene.
3217540	3221480	There are new prototypes for the Atari 7800.
3221480	3223140	That's right.
3223140	3227440	You can actually download them, the ROMs, you can get them at Atariage.com.
3227440	3229140	There's a game called Sirius.
3229140	3233460	It's a side scrolling shooter that's kind of like R-Type and Gradius.
3233460	3235360	For the 7800, it's not bad.
3235360	3239960	Plutos is a vertically scrolling shooter, it's not quite as ambitious as Sirius according
3239960	3244920	to the poster at LostLevels.org where this is found, but it's still not bad, and Rampart,
3244920	3251120	which apparently is some type of port of the arcade game that I quite enjoyed Rampart back
3251120	3252120	when...
3252120	3253120	Yeah, remember that game?
3253120	3254880	They ported it to a lot of systems.
3254880	3258920	Apparently there was a prototype for the 7800 that never quite got off the ground.
3258920	3259920	So there you have it.
3259920	3262940	I actually have a couple 5200 prototypes.
3262940	3264640	Like actual cartridges or just ROMs?
3264640	3267720	Well, the remakes like that that they did.
3267720	3268800	I have a couple of them.
3268800	3271280	I always wanted to pick up one of those flashback consoles.
3271280	3272280	I think they're kind of fun.
3272280	3277600	I might still pick one up, but they don't have Activision games in there, do they?
3277600	3279840	I'm going to get made fun of by Irene for this, but I don't care.
3279840	3281720	I think they have an Activision one.
3281720	3287260	My favorite Atari 2600 game of all time, next, well, there's two, is Pitfall 2 is the first,
3287260	3288260	but the other one is Kaboom.
3288260	3290280	Why would I make fun of you?
3290280	3292220	You should make fun of me for everything.
3292220	3293880	If it was Burger Time, then I would laugh.
3293880	3296680	I do love Burger Time, but not quite as much as Kaboom.
3296680	3299200	All right, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
3299200	3301560	I hope you do, because I still got votes to tally, so we're going to get into the last
3301560	3302560	minute stories right now.
3302560	3306160	Then we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge tonight, a special Skype segment.
3306160	3311000	Yes, as actually, well, we touched on it a little bit earlier, yeah, One Million Signatures
3311000	3314520	and Oovil's Career, hooray.
3314520	3319720	Somebody for some reason, I don't know why, but there's a picture on Xbox 360 fanboy of
3319720	3328280	a Master Chief My Little Pony that someone made, and it's kind of weird looking.
3328280	3329280	That creeps me out.
3329280	3330280	Gives me nightmares.
3330280	3331740	It's very creepy.
3331740	3339240	There's also some videos on Xbox 360 fanboy of the new download content for Burnout Paradise,
3339240	3345440	actually, and that's also available on the developer's website, CriterionGames.com.
3345440	3348600	They have a thing on there for that.
3348600	3354800	Let's see here, there's also, this was another one of the April Fool's jokes that was out
3354800	3362760	there, Super Pee Pee Brothers, it was from ThinkGeek.com, they did the thing that the
3362760	3367000	Wii remote would kind of fit into this, almost like a jockstrap or panty thing that you would
3367000	3372960	put on, and some strap-on thing and you would pee into toilets, so that's kind of funny.
3372960	3381240	And then, GamesRadar.com has a list of the top counterfeit games, those are like the
3381240	3386880	independent sequels, prequels, custom games, etc.
3386880	3394520	On the list, Halo Zero, which was a side-scrolling version of Halo that someone created that
3394520	3401160	looks pretty cool, they also had some other stuff, Black Mesa, which I think is a remake
3401160	3409040	of Half-Life 1 and the Half-Life 2 engine, and there was also a Sonic game, Super Mario
3409040	3415040	Brothers Revenge of Bowser, that looks pretty neat, kind of in the style of, what is it,
3415040	3422440	looks like, not Lost Levels, I don't remember, yeah, Mario 3, and then they also have Paper
3422440	3428200	Bowser World, Paper Bowser World Operation Grom, those are two full games that are done
3428200	3435720	kind of similar to Super Paper Mario, and then Neo Sonic Universe, which looks kind
3435720	3441760	of cool, kind of a brand new side-scrolling Sonic game, of course the Metroid 2 remake,
3441760	3449520	which now has a playable demo work-in-progress thing you can test out, and then finally Chrono
3449520	3454800	Resurrection, which of course you may remember got cancelled, it was the full 3D remake of
3454800	3455800	Chrono Trigger.
3455800	3459320	And I think what should be added to the list, they have that new Mario game that someone
3459320	3464600	was making that was a mash-up of Halo, Mega Man, and all that stuff, that should probably
3464600	3469120	be added to the list, but if you go check out the article, which is on Dig right now
3469120	3474000	and is also on GamesRadar.com, they have links to, well, most of those games that you can
3474000	3482920	download, of course not Chrono Resurrection, because only the devs get to play that one.
3482920	3489960	And then I've got to import this game, Momo World War II, it's like chicks and Nazi chicks
3489960	3497600	in bikinis or something, done anime style, it's a sexy Nazi anime girl game, I don't know,
3497600	3499600	that sounds pretty awesome.
3499600	3505760	Alright, are you guys ready to figure out who won tonight's listless segment?
3505760	3506760	Why not?
3506760	3510880	Alright, let's reveal the winners tonight.
3510880	3517920	Who's Li3CC5 could do to get us to stay the definitive list as voted by you, the chatters
3517920	3520700	created by us, the hosts and guests.
3520700	3528400	Here it is, the number three thing that Li3CC5 could do to get us to stay, provide us a unicorn
3528400	3529400	via Irene.
3529400	3530400	Number three?
3530400	3534440	Unicorns can do anything, that should have been number one, it would have made all the
3534440	3538180	other dreams come true, but I won't mope, I'm okay.
3538180	3544720	At number two, we have a tie, at number two we have a tie, number two, buy us a George
3544720	3549340	Foreman full cow grilling machine, is more important than the unicorn, how about a George
3549340	3551400	Foreman unicorn grilling machine?
3551400	3552400	No!
3552400	3553720	Punch your face.
3553720	3557120	And not a damn thing, they done fucked up.
3557120	3558760	That was number two.
3558760	3562780	For number two, I was number two, I was surprised too, but then I looked at what was number
3562780	3567120	one and I wasn't surprised at all, the number one thing that Li3CC5 could do to get us to
3567120	3574400	stay, purchase one million copies of the Eye of Judgment, big surprise, and settle this
3574400	3575400	bet once and for all.
3575400	3578360	You do realize, of course, that Jamie does not get a cookie now?
3578360	3580540	That's okay, I can't have a cookie.
3580540	3581540	You know what?
3581540	3586000	Actually, um, let's see, Heal Rob's pancreas would have been fourth and then give Jamie
3586000	3587440	a cookie would have been fifth.
3587440	3588640	I don't want a cookie.
3588640	3589640	Alright.
3589640	3590640	You know what?
3590640	3596800	When I come up here to do the show the day after my birthday, I want banana pudding.
3596800	3598040	Isn't it nice to want?
3598040	3601880	Or carrot cake.
3601880	3603880	Those are my demands.
3603880	3613840	Alright, before we get into our special Skype segment tonight, I'm actually opening this
3613840	3622280	up real quick for someone specific to give us a call here, someone that wanted to get
3622280	3630300	through tonight, an OLR blast from the past who wanted to say some final words about Li3CC5,
3630300	3631760	so just got to wait for that to come in.
3631760	3632900	I know who it is.
3632900	3635800	You should be scared a little bit, actually.
3635800	3637800	I'm just waiting for that call to come in.
3637800	3639600	Are you going to call any person?
3639600	3641880	I know who you are.
3641880	3644800	I told them to get by their phone.
3644800	3649760	If I see a call from somebody else pop up, I'm going to be pissed.
3649760	3651400	Any other last minute stories you might have by chance?
3651400	3652880	Log in chat track really quick.
3652880	3655600	Nah, that Nazi bean pursuit girl game looks weird.
3655600	3656680	It does look weird.
3656680	3657680	You are right.
3657680	3658680	Alright.
3658680	3659680	Oh, look!
3659680	3660680	We have a call.
3660680	3661680	Hi!
3661680	3662680	This is Orange Launch Radio.
3662680	3663680	Who's this?
3663680	3665860	This is Rob.
3665860	3668120	And yes, what would you like to say?
3668120	3674840	I would like to say that I am very sick because my pre-care is hot.
3674840	3677280	Hey, this is Extifer.
3677280	3678280	How's it going?
3678280	3679280	Hi!
3679280	3680280	Oh my god, Extifer?
3680280	3683840	I'm fine, even though you're an asshole.
3683840	3685840	So what's up, Extifer?
3685840	3692000	Oh, I'm doing pretty well and you?
3692000	3693000	I am.
3693000	3695800	Well, my pancreas hurts a little bit, yeah.
3695800	3697120	That's alright.
3697120	3702360	You should stop letting Irene punch you in the pancreas.
3702360	3703640	I'm going to do that, actually.
3703640	3706200	No, that's never going to happen.
3706200	3713720	Extifer, you used to do a show here on our station, our little network here on Live3CC5.
3713720	3718240	We already canceled your show once and now we're leaving from Live3CC5 altogether.
3718240	3721240	Does that make you sad?
3721240	3726540	Yeah, actually.
3726540	3733680	I was really sad when I couldn't do the show anymore because I live in another city now
3733680	3740320	and it's hard for me to get over there to do any type of programming anyway, so we kind
3740320	3747280	of ended, at least with me, it kind of ended a long time ago, but yeah, it does make me
3747280	3756400	sad that we don't have the opportunity to do it again, I guess, unless there's an opportunity
3756400	3757400	in the future.
3757400	3761600	What did you think of tonight's list list, though, with the ways that Live3CC5 could
3761600	3762600	get us to stay?
3762600	3766720	Do you agree or is there something else that you would have put on the list?
3766720	3773080	Oh, I'm all for the cow and the George Farm and Grill.
3773080	3774080	Sounds good, huh?
3774080	3775080	Well, actually...
3775080	3778880	I'm like, you know, get me a cow, put it on the grill.
3778880	3782240	I am like, you know, meat central.
3782240	3783800	That's all I can think about.
3783800	3784800	Oh, my.
3784800	3786280	Did he just say, I am meat central?
3786280	3787280	I think he did.
3787280	3788280	He did.
3788280	3789280	He said, I am meat central.
3789280	3791200	Yeah, I am meat central.
3791200	3795480	Is my connection breaking up because I feel like the connection is breaking up?
3795480	3797480	No, it's just a little laggy, but that's OK.
3797480	3799680	We're going to wrap up because we want to get to some real calls.
3799680	3800680	Just kidding.
3800680	3801680	Oh, snap.
3801680	3802680	I'm a fake call.
3802680	3807640	But I just want to ask you real quickly, do you have any parting words?
3807640	3811240	I mean, it's not that we won't ever have you on All Games, our new home, but do you have
3811240	3813120	any parting words for Live3CC5?
3813120	3818800	No, I'm about ready to go bleach my asshole.
3818800	3822080	So that's it.
3822080	3823080	All right.
3823080	3824080	All right.
3824080	3825080	Have a good one.
3825080	3826080	Bye, Extover.
3826080	3827080	All right.
3827080	3828080	Have a good synchronous.
3828080	3829080	All right.
3829080	3830080	You, too.
3830080	3831080	Bye.
3831080	3832080	Bye, Extover.
3832080	3836360	We love you.
3836360	3837360	And your asshole.
3837360	3838640	That's what we should have put on the list.
3838640	3841600	Live3CC5 has to bleach Extover's asshole.
3841600	3842600	Yeah.
3842600	3843600	Oh, God.
3843600	3845600	Oh, my God.
3845600	3846600	No.
3846600	3847600	Ew.
3847600	3848600	All right.
3848600	3849600	All right.
3849600	3851760	Here's the deal for tonight's Skype line.
3851760	3855280	We're going to open it up, but with some boundaries tonight.
3855280	3860480	Tonight, you can state your name, and you get to ask us a question, okay?
3860480	3866520	But if you try to do anything else, like you'd start ranting about Jack Voldemort or whatever,
3866520	3871160	then you're getting cut off, because tonight, we want to bring back for one last time on
3871160	3874440	Live3CC5, Ask Orange Lounge.
3874440	3875440	You ready, Jamie?
3875440	3877440	This is for you.
3877440	3885760	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
3885760	3889720	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
3889720	3894200	Don't forget to call us right now on the Skype line, but if you talk too much, we're hanging
3894200	3895200	up on your asks.
3895200	3896200	We can do that.
3896200	3897200	We're the hosts.
3897200	3898200	All right.
3898200	3899200	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3899200	3903880	If we don't get enough calls, then we'll, I don't know, we'll beg and plead for stuff
3903880	3904880	from chat.
3904880	3905880	All right.
3905880	3906880	Here we go.
3906880	3907880	All right.
3907880	3908880	Call her.
3908880	3909880	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3909880	3910880	State your name.
3910880	3912240	Um, Legend of Zaku.
3912240	3914120	State your question, Legend of Zaku.
3914120	3915360	All right.
3915360	3919880	Basically, I know it's been like five and a half years and everything, but do you have
3919880	3927320	any regrets, any regrets at all of the journey you've taken so far?
3927320	3929040	I'll start with Dark Zaku.
3929040	3930040	Ladies first.
3930040	3933120	I regret letting Andrew tell jokes.
3933120	3934520	Loki?
3934520	3936320	I regret it too.
3936320	3942120	I regret ever doing an impression of Tingle's voice.
3942120	3945800	I'm surprised you didn't say I didn't regret ever buying karaoke revolution.
3945800	3946800	I bet.
3946800	3947800	All right.
3947800	3948800	Too late.
3948800	3949800	Rice Princess?
3949800	3950800	Drew?
3950800	3951800	Anything?
3951800	3952800	I regret nothing.
3952800	3953800	Wow.
3953800	3954800	That's really fucking, I mean, freaking loud.
3954800	3955800	I told you.
3955800	3956800	Drew?
3956800	3959260	If you say I regret.
3959260	3960720	That's more than the question.
3960720	3962720	All right.
3962720	3964720	Hearts.
3964720	3965720	Here's the thing though.
3965720	3970280	The only thing I regret, I'm going to be honest, not doing this sooner.
3970280	3971600	I have to admit.
3971600	3975920	I think we could have done something like this a little while ago, but I'm excited about
3975920	3978680	the changes and stuff and everything happens for a reason.
3978680	3981360	I regret not coming to the studio sooner.
3981360	3982800	All right.
3982800	3984800	Next call.
3984800	3985800	We're waiting for one.
3985800	3986800	Sure.
3986800	3987800	Sure.
3987800	3988800	All right.
3988800	3989800	Here we go.
3989800	3990800	Here we go.
3990800	3991800	We're getting another call.
3991800	3992800	Hi.
3992800	3993800	Caller.
3993800	3994800	State your name.
3994800	3995800	Hello?
3995800	3996800	Lone Vacationer.
3996800	3999120	Hello, Lone Vacationer.
3999120	4001680	State your question, please.
4001680	4004640	Yes, Rob.
4004640	4013400	I was wondering why you had to be so retarded for Metroid instead of Chrono Trigger.
4013400	4017040	The sad thing is the podcast listeners aren't going to get this because they didn't hear
4017040	4018680	the bonus statement tonight.
4018680	4024600	I voted for Super Metroid because I believe it to be the greatest video game of all time.
4024600	4029200	Look, as much as I love Chrono Trigger, I loved the Final Fantasy series just a little
4029200	4030200	bit more.
4030200	4031960	The battles got annoying to me in Chrono Trigger.
4031960	4033960	I don't know what it was, but it did have a good story.
4033960	4038780	I respect Chrono Trigger as a game, but as far as Super Metroid, it was the music.
4038780	4043280	It was the fact that it was a game that you could sit down and beat in one sitting, but
4043280	4045040	it felt like there was so much you could do.
4045040	4046840	You could play it where you collect everything.
4046840	4048260	You could play it where you explore everything.
4048260	4050320	You could play it to speed beat it.
4050320	4053240	All of those things were accessible to a normal person.
4053240	4057760	Usually it takes a hobbyist to speed play through a game and stuff, but just with the
4057760	4059400	items and everything.
4059400	4062640	It's just a game I remember very much in my memory.
4062640	4066640	So there you have it.
4066640	4072240	See the caller knew not to say anything else because that would be more than a question.
4072240	4074760	Let's get to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4074760	4077320	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4077320	4078320	Ask Orange Lounge.
4078320	4079320	State your name.
4079320	4081040	The name is Rama.
4081040	4082040	Hello, Rama.
4082040	4084440	Please, state your question.
4084440	4090920	My question is, to everyone, your greatest or favorite moment on Live 365?
4090920	4094560	Oh shit, this is going to be a hard one.
4094560	4099280	Oh my God, there's so much.
4099280	4102360	You can't say it though because that would be more than a question, but you could private
4102360	4105280	message it to me in chat and I might read it.
4105280	4110440	DarkSakura, what was your favorite moment in all of Live 365's history?
4110440	4111440	Leaving it.
4111440	4112440	Yes, answer ever.
4112440	4113440	Loki.
4113440	4120400	The Live 365 Awards, were they forgot... Oh my God, do I have a clip of that?
4120400	4121400	I think I do.
4121400	4122400	Oh my God.
4122400	4123400	Let me find a clip of that.
4123400	4128440	Oh God, that's the best thing to go out on was when they fucking forgot our name at the
4128440	4129600	Live 365 Awards.
4129600	4130680	I hope we have that somewhere.
4130680	4133320	I'm going to dig through this.
4133320	4137200	Rice Princess, Drew, do you have anything?
4137200	4140360	Episode 69, the whole thing.
4140360	4142720	It's the whole thing.
4142720	4146080	That was a pretty classic episode, I got to say.
4146080	4147840	Oh God, I hope we can find that.
4147840	4149780	It's got to be in there somewhere.
4149780	4152180	I think... I know where it is.
4152180	4153280	It was sent to me as a file.
4153280	4158120	I know this is live radio, but guys, if you've never heard this, it is so fucking worth it.
4158120	4160120	Oh wait, I have another one.
4160120	4161120	What?
4161120	4163120	Oh, crap.
4163120	4164120	What?
4164120	4165120	Nothing.
4165120	4166120	Okay.
4166120	4170680	Did I delete it on accident?
4170680	4171680	Oh God, I did not.
4171680	4172680	Oh Rob, how could you?
4172680	4173680	I hope you did.
4173680	4175680	It would be terrible.
4175680	4179360	Well, briefly explain for the listeners what that was about.
4179360	4180360	Loki, what happened?
4180360	4185160	So we got nominated for most unlikely to hear on like terrestrial...
4185160	4189400	Hold on, let me see if this is it.
4189400	4190400	No, that's something else.
4190400	4193080	It's like a... Why do I have a Kylie Minogue song in there?
4193080	4195080	God, I'm gay.
4195080	4200200	It's like most unlikely to hear on radio or something like that, which is weird because
4200200	4205240	they have like 80 stations and we have a ton of 80 stations around here, but we won that.
4205240	4206240	And...
4206240	4207240	No, we didn't win.
4207240	4208240	We got nominated for it.
4208240	4209240	Oh, we got nominated.
4209240	4210240	I'm sorry.
4210240	4211240	We didn't win that.
4211240	4212640	We got nominated and they forgot to even mention our names.
4212640	4217640	Yeah, they were reading the nominees off an envelope and they completely left us off.
4217640	4222680	And we were in the back going, hey, because it's really funny, you can hear it on the
4222680	4223680	recording.
4223680	4225120	Oh God, I wish I still had it.
4225120	4226840	I'm going to be really sad if I can't find it.
4226840	4228640	It would be for Afterbirth maybe?
4228640	4232880	No, because I want the podcast people to hear it too.
4232880	4234160	I did find this.
4234160	4235160	Oh, nevermind.
4235160	4237400	I can't do that one.
4237400	4238400	It's too long.
4238400	4239400	Oh.
4239400	4240400	All right, I'll play this.
4240400	4241400	You remember this sound clip?
4241400	4242400	Here's an old sound clip.
4242400	4245080	This is Tom Brokaw on the West Coast fixing the word bukkake.
4245080	4249140	This is the edited version that they aired on the West Coast.
4249140	4252800	This is actually a clip from Howard Stern, but it was so funny here on the show when
4252800	4253800	they played it.
4253800	4254800	Moscow tonight.
4254800	4259360	Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously
4259360	4260360	today.
4260360	4262760	The first crash happened in Buchalki.
4262760	4264920	That's about 110 miles south of Moscow.
4264920	4265920	Okay.
4265920	4266920	That's not the funny way.
4266920	4267920	That's not right.
4267920	4268920	That ain't right.
4268920	4270600	People on the West Coast got gypped of hearing bukkake.
4270600	4271600	Tom.
4271600	4275640	In this report out of Moscow tonight, two Russian planes carrying a total of more than
4275640	4279280	100 people crashed almost simultaneously today.
4279280	4286400	The first crash happened in Buchalki about 110 miles south of Moscow.
4286400	4287400	He said bukkake.
4287400	4292800	That clip was courtesy of the Howard Stern show, but that bukkake thing, I swear to God,
4292800	4297280	gave us like a month worth of stuff.
4297280	4299240	I don't think I have it anymore.
4299240	4300240	I'm so sad.
4300240	4302720	What about the one where he goes tax cunts or something like that?
4302720	4303720	Tax cunts?
4303720	4304720	Oh, yeah.
4304720	4305720	I remember that.
4305720	4306720	I don't know if I have that.
4306720	4311680	I don't think I'm going to be able to find that clip.
4311680	4314680	If I do, I will put it on the website or something.
4314680	4315900	It's just so old.
4315900	4319280	I think a lot of the old files just got purged.
4319280	4320360	Over time, it happens.
4320360	4321580	I do have this.
4321580	4324480	This is what became of that.
4324480	4325480	Gaming radio.
4325480	4331040	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
4331040	4332040	Buchalki.
4332040	4334040	Orange Lounge Radio.
4334040	4336320	Oh, my God.
4336320	4338560	We just talked over it, you stupid bitch.
4338560	4339560	Oh, my gosh.
4339560	4340560	Talk with us.
4340560	4341560	Buchalki.
4341560	4342560	Orange Lounge Radio.
4342560	4343560	Tax cunts.
4343560	4344560	That's hilarious.
4344560	4345560	Oh, my gosh.
4345560	4346560	That was epic.
4346560	4347560	That was more than a question.
4347560	4348560	Sorry.
4348560	4361800	You should play all of the old promos or buffers or whatever.
4361800	4362800	Oh, you can't.
4362800	4365760	I mean, you could string them in a sequence or something.
4365760	4366760	Some of them are stupid.
4366760	4367760	I love them.
4367760	4369800	Max, some of them are so stupid.
4369800	4372320	They were like the ketchup.
4372320	4376000	I still have the nori nori nori promo that never aired.
4376000	4377320	Oh, wow.
4377320	4378320	That's old school.
4378320	4379320	I'll send it to you later.
4379320	4380320	All right.
4380320	4385280	My favorite moment in the Orange Lounge Radio history was the drug show where Jamie drank
4385280	4392120	so much tequila, she lied in my bed face down after consuming an entire box of waffles and
4392120	4394840	had me delivering waffles to her.
4394840	4400720	And I was running up the wall yelling, I'm in the matrix, I'm in the matrix.
4400720	4404800	And how sober was I by the end of the show?
4404800	4406960	We can't forget Super Bacon either.
4406960	4409640	And I wonder why my pancreas is fucked.
4409640	4410640	The deep fried rice.
4410640	4411640	Oh, rice balls.
4411640	4413640	Remember when we did Peep Jousting?
4413640	4414640	Peep Wars.
4414640	4415640	Oh, my God.
4415640	4416640	I think that was actually on a Wednesday night show.
4416640	4417640	It was.
4417640	4422240	Basically, you take two marshmallow Peeps and you put toothpicks in them and then put
4422240	4426920	them in the microwave and it's Peep Jousting because they get really big in the microwave
4426920	4430080	and then eventually one slaughters the other.
4430080	4431600	It's so fucking hilarious.
4431600	4432600	All right.
4432600	4433600	Good times.
4433600	4434800	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4434800	4435800	State your name.
4435800	4436800	GS68.
4436800	4437800	GS68.
4437800	4441760	And what is your question for tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?
4441760	4444320	Any progress on the Fahnemey panel?
4444320	4447000	Any progress on the Fahnemey panel?
4447000	4448000	No.
4448000	4449000	Shit.
4449000	4450000	And I probably would.
4450000	4451000	That's more than a question.
4451000	4455440	And if I remember correctly, that's Memorial Day weekend, which is the first weekend in
4455440	4456440	May.
4456440	4457440	Yeah.
4457440	4458440	Last weekend in May.
4458440	4459440	Last weekend in May.
4459440	4460440	I know.
4460440	4461440	Okay.
4461440	4462440	Hmm.
4462440	4463440	Let me know.
4463440	4464440	I'll go and do the panel myself.
4464440	4468320	Well, I'll take Rice Princess next to her and I'll just say their dark soccer at
4468320	4469320	Logan.
4469320	4470320	No, no, no.
4470320	4471320	No.
4471320	4472320	If it's the last weekend in May.
4472320	4473320	I'll be Loki.
4473320	4474320	If it's the last weekend in May, that's fine.
4474320	4477880	The first weekend in May, but I'm actually going to be, well, I'm gone up, out of town.
4477880	4486720	I'm actually going to Vegas on my anniversary and not taking Nelly with me, unfortunately.
4486720	4487720	It'll work.
4487720	4488720	I got to say this.
4488720	4490800	DJ Jinai in chat says, favorite time on OLR?
4490800	4493020	The lesbians in the Mississippi orgy with Sky.
4493020	4497080	If you didn't hear last year's April Fool's joke, that was so fucking funny.
4497080	4498080	Seriously, go find it.
4498080	4499080	All right.
4499080	4500080	We have another call.
4500080	4501080	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4501080	4502080	Who's this?
4502080	4503080	State your name.
4503080	4504080	This is Jayden.
4504080	4505080	Hello, Jayden.
4505080	4506080	And a long time listener, rare caller.
4506080	4507080	We don't hear from you much.
4507080	4509040	Jayden, state your question.
4509040	4510320	Yes.
4510320	4515980	I have actually a very favorite moment in live 365 history.
4515980	4520480	You better phrase it as a question or you're in trouble.
4520480	4521480	Okay.
4521480	4524240	This is jeopardy, bitch.
4524240	4530400	Do you remember when Loki sang, oops, I did it again?
4530400	4531400	That was a good job.
4531400	4532400	All right.
4532400	4533880	Do I remember when Loki sang, oops, I did it again?
4533880	4535800	No, but God, I wish I had a recording of that.
4535800	4537360	You must have done it in that same episode.
4537360	4538600	No, it wasn't the same episode.
4538600	4540960	It was later on when we tried to recapture the moment.
4540960	4544780	We tried to do it again later and that's when we learned our lesson that lightning never
4544780	4549360	strikes twice because the second time we played, well, apparently Jayden disagrees.
4549360	4550720	He said it was very funny still.
4550720	4551720	I don't remember.
4551720	4557360	I don't remember it, but I sort of remember vaguely doing something that wasn't funny.
4557360	4559640	It was still pretty damn funny.
4559640	4560640	All right.
4560640	4561640	All right.
4561640	4565200	Thank you for your question and following the rules very well.
4565200	4566200	He had a challenge there.
4566200	4567200	He goes creative.
4567200	4568200	All right.
4568200	4569200	All right.
4569200	4570200	Hello.
4570200	4571920	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4571920	4572920	Who's this?
4572920	4574920	This is Ospher.
4574920	4575920	Ospher.
4575920	4576920	All right.
4576920	4579720	Please state your question, Ospher.
4579720	4583680	How much do you charge for autographed Xbox 360 faceplates and what's your favorite dish
4583680	4584680	at the Olive Garden?
4584680	4585680	That was a two-part question.
4585680	4586680	She's quick.
4586680	4587680	That's all right.
4587680	4590520	We'll let it slide.
4590520	4591520	Here we go.
4591520	4593520	How much do we charge for an autographed Xbox 360 faceplate?
4593520	4597560	I don't see why we wouldn't charge anything more than the cost of the faceplate plus shipping.
4597560	4599940	We're not out to make a profit on it.
4599940	4603760	If you want one, which I hear you do, we'll work something out.
4603760	4605640	I've got some extra faceplates.
4605640	4606640	Do you?
4606640	4607640	Yeah.
4607640	4608640	You want to just give them one?
4608640	4609640	Yeah.
4609640	4611760	We need to airbrush it white and then autograph it.
4611760	4615440	I have no extra white ones because I bought other ones.
4615440	4616440	Oh.
4616440	4617440	All right.
4617440	4618440	We'll figure something out, Ospher.
4618440	4619440	Another question.
4619440	4620440	I like this one.
4620440	4623960	What about the Olive Garden?
4623960	4626400	The breadsticks.
4626400	4631960	Mine was the, what did they call it, Pasta Rustica or something like that, and they got
4631960	4633640	rid of it, those assholes.
4633640	4635260	And then I like the Tuscan chicken.
4635260	4636260	They got rid of that, too.
4636260	4637260	What about the fuckers?
4637260	4638260	I'm mad at Olive Garden right now.
4638260	4640960	Rob's not allowed to tell anybody he likes anything at the Olive Garden.
4640960	4644200	I can't eat them anymore anyway, at least for the next month while I'm on this.
4644200	4647080	I'm rather plain, so I always get the spaghetti with meat sauce, so.
4647080	4648080	You are boring.
4648080	4649080	Love it.
4649080	4650080	I always used to get the shrimp scampi.
4650080	4651080	Actually, I really like the risotto.
4651080	4659080	What's the name of that chicken dish on our first or third date or something that I got?
4659080	4660080	I don't know.
4660080	4664160	It's some chicken dish with pasta, and I also like their Zuppa de whatever the hell's in
4664160	4665160	it.
4665160	4668440	Yeah, the white one with sausage and potatoes.
4668440	4669440	Mmm.
4669440	4670440	That's really good.
4670440	4671440	Oh, God.
4671440	4672440	My pancreas hurts just thinking about it.
4672440	4673440	All right.
4673440	4674440	Thanks for the question, caller.
4674440	4675440	Take care.
4675440	4676440	We'll figure something out about that faceplate.
4676440	4677440	All right.
4677440	4678440	Skype line's still open.
4678440	4679440	I don't see any need to close.
4679440	4680440	I'm so sorry.
4680440	4681440	I'm so short tonight.
4681440	4682440	Caller, please state your name.
4682440	4684440	It's SSJ1 at your mat.
4684440	4689320	Hello, and please state your question.
4689320	4693040	My question is, what would be your dream interview to have on the show?
4693040	4695200	Ooh, that's a good one.
4695200	4697400	Dream interview to have on the show.
4697400	4698840	Who would be your dream interview?
4698840	4702240	Loki, we'll start with you.
4702240	4705560	I guess the developers of Grand Theft Auto maybe?
4705560	4707280	I don't know.
4707280	4708280	All right.
4708280	4709760	Eric Sacher, your dream interview?
4709760	4710760	Akira Yamaoka.
4710760	4712760	Did we have him?
4712760	4716760	No, we didn't have him on the show, but we've seen him.
4716760	4717760	Oh, no.
4717760	4718760	That's right.
4718760	4719960	You narrowly missed it.
4719960	4724520	That's right, because somebody wanted to go interview somebody and lost the recording
4724520	4728520	of the damn interview.
4728520	4731080	I'll throw a curveball at you in just a minute.
4731080	4733680	I'll tell you why, too.
4733680	4737560	Drew, what would be your dream interview to see us interview?
4737560	4739000	Freeze pop.
4739000	4741080	We had one guy on the show, remember?
4741080	4742080	All of them.
4742080	4743080	All of them.
4743080	4744080	Here in studio performing a la Mo.
4744080	4745080	Yes.
4745080	4746080	All right.
4746080	4747080	A la Mo.
4747080	4748080	I like that.
4748080	4749080	A la Mo.
4749080	4752080	Rice Princess.
4752080	4756120	Christian Bale naked in front of me.
4756120	4757120	You're asking too much.
4757120	4758120	Via a unicorn.
4758120	4762280	Via a unicorn, and there won't be a lot of talking.
4762280	4763840	I'm just going to say this.
4763840	4769320	My dream interview would be Morgan Webb, because I'd have a field day.
4769320	4771600	You better have a damn good reason.
4771600	4772600	I would have a field day.
4772600	4773600	Wait, wait, wait.
4773600	4774600	Stop.
4774600	4775600	I got to stop you real quick.
4775600	4776600	What?
4776600	4777600	They posted an old video clip of her.
4777600	4778600	She was on the Tyra Bank show.
4778600	4779600	Bye, caller.
4779600	4780600	Thanks for the question.
4780600	4786520	She was actually on the Tyra Bank show one time and spouting off some three different
4786520	4790480	types of gamers and what you could learn from your guy based on the types of games he played,
4790480	4793440	and that was so retarded.
4793440	4794520	The chat room is yelling at me.
4794520	4799320	I don't want the interview because I think it's going to be... Let me ask her some questions
4799320	4800320	in public.
4800320	4801320	That's all I want.
4801320	4802320	All right.
4802320	4803320	You forgot Nathan.
4803320	4804320	Oh, I'm sorry, Nathan.
4804320	4806320	I didn't have anything to say.
4806320	4807320	Damn it.
4807320	4808320	He's so emotional.
4808320	4809320	Caller, state your name.
4809320	4810320	Hello?
4810320	4811320	Hi.
4811320	4812320	Caller, what is your name?
4812320	4813320	Yeah.
4813320	4814320	Gold Banjo here.
4814320	4815320	Hello, Gold.
4815320	4827440	I was wondering, seeing as how you're an internet radio show and all, I'm wondering if anybody's
4827440	4831160	ever threatened you or stalked you or something.
4831160	4832160	Yes.
4832160	4833160	Wow.
4833160	4834160	Threatened us or stalked us.
4834160	4835160	That's a good one.
4835160	4836800	That's what stalked you.
4836800	4838800	I don't remember anyone.
4838800	4840920	Wait, who?
4840920	4841920	No.
4841920	4842920	Oh, God.
4842920	4845400	Did he?
4845400	4846400	Yes.
4846400	4847400	Yes.
4847400	4848760	Or she?
4848760	4849760	You know what?
4849760	4852200	There was a person that was borderline stalking me.
4852200	4854280	See you later.
4854280	4855760	I'm listening to what you're saying now.
4855760	4856760	Yeah.
4856760	4857760	I was more into questions.
4857760	4858760	Sorry, buddy.
4858760	4859760	All right.
4859760	4861920	He cut in and out a little bit, but yes, I forgot.
4861920	4863800	There was an infamous person.
4863800	4868040	I'm not going to say their name on the air, but there was an infamous person in Life is
4868040	4869180	Five history.
4869180	4871400	He actually was kind of a trusted member of Orange and Andre.
4871400	4874400	He was a moderator of our channel for some time, and then he just kind of... He went
4874400	4878080	kind of loopy, and dude, he called my cell phone.
4878080	4882080	I don't know how he got my number, but he like... I got this voicemail message once.
4882080	4884600	It was like, why did you ban me?
4884600	4887040	It was like really scary and creepy.
4887040	4888040	Oh.
4888040	4889040	Well.
4889040	4890040	Well, we got better.
4890040	4891040	Yeah.
4891040	4892040	Yeah.
4892040	4893040	It was-
4893040	4894040	Yeah.
4894040	4895040	Yeah.
4895040	4898160	But I got better.
4898160	4902760	I don't think we've ever really had anything beyond that, though, and that was more just
4902760	4904960	kind of like a silly internet prank.
4904960	4907280	Not that that's acceptable.
4907280	4910200	It's not, but nobody's ever threatened us with death or anything.
4910200	4911200	No.
4911200	4912200	We're not famous.
4912200	4913200	What the hell are you talking about?
4913200	4914200	All right.
4914200	4915200	All right.
4915200	4917200	I'll threaten you with death if you don't change your vote.
4917200	4918200	Hi.
4918200	4919200	Shut up.
4919200	4920200	Hi, callers.
4920200	4921200	Please state your name.
4921200	4922200	Yeah.
4922200	4923200	What's up?
4923200	4924200	This is Ross Deal UT.
4924200	4928240	Ross Deal UT, and please state your question.
4928240	4935280	How many blind monkeys do you think it took for Ubisoft to come up with the name HAWX?
4935280	4940420	One for each letter, four.
4940420	4946040	Only one, because you have to understand, hawks is edgy because they have an X instead
4946040	4947760	of a KS.
4947760	4950320	We're thinking 90s now.
4950320	4951320	It took 90 monkeys?
4951320	4952320	Wow.
4952320	4953320	That's extreme.
4953320	4955280	You're laughing too much, and that's more than a question.
4955280	4956280	No, but just kidding.
4956280	4958280	We've got to free up the line.
4958280	4959280	All right.
4959280	4960280	I like this.
4960280	4961280	This is like a condensed...
4961280	4962280	It's great.
4962280	4964320	Look how many people were getting in tonight for the last...
4964320	4965320	Okay.
4965320	4966320	We still got...
4966320	4967640	I know there's still people trying to get in, so I'm waiting.
4967640	4968640	All right.
4968640	4969640	Hi.
4969640	4970640	Here we go.
4970640	4971640	Another call.
4971640	4972640	Hello, caller.
4972640	4973640	Please state your name.
4973640	4974640	Hello.
4974640	4977200	This is your favorite Swede, A.K.
4977200	4978200	River.
4978200	4982880	Hello, and please state your question, our favorite Swede.
4982880	4990160	Why did you start out in Live 365 in the first place?
4990160	4992940	What a damn good question.
4992940	4997000	Go figure it comes from someone not from America.
4997000	5001440	Why did we start on Live 365 in the first place?
5001440	5002440	I have my answer.
5002440	5004000	I don't know if anyone else wants to contribute.
5004000	5005000	It was easy.
5005000	5006000	Here's the thing.
5006000	5007000	Well, two reasons.
5007000	5013480	A, it was easy because of the fact that Live 365 makes it pretty easy to just have all
5013480	5018800	your MP3s in one place, you sign in, you go, and you didn't have to have that resource
5018800	5023520	to run a stream 24-7 because when we first started the station, we thought it was going
5023520	5029120	to be about the music as much as it was the show, but our true love really ended up being
5029120	5033280	the show, and so Live 365 made it very easy to go 24-7.
5033280	5039760	And this show is a spinoff of sorts of another show under Sedation Live, which is hosted
5039760	5044940	by Travis Donovan, who's now on our network.
5044940	5051200	That show was about, boy, this is a long history, probably more than you bargained for, but
5051200	5057960	that show started in 2001 as a show actually about Rocky Horror Picture Show, but it didn't
5057960	5060760	really keep that theme very long.
5060760	5062360	We didn't talk about that very much.
5062360	5063360	Everything.
5063360	5064360	We talked about everything.
5064360	5068920	Dude, you know, one time, if you've ever seen Cat House Girls, the guy who runs that, Dennis,
5068920	5073280	one time we had him on the show as an interview, and it all started as a crank call.
5073280	5076120	It was the most epic moment in under Sedation Live history, I'm telling you.
5076120	5077120	I remember that.
5077120	5080760	But under Sedation Live was on Live 365, and I saw how easy it was there, and so it just
5080760	5084920	kind of made it easy, and that's really why we were there.
5084920	5086040	Good question.
5086040	5087040	Thank you.
5087040	5088040	Have a good one.
5088040	5089040	All right.
5089040	5092340	Let's see if we get some more.
5092340	5094400	201877 Game OLR.
5094400	5095400	How many more?
5095400	5096400	Oh my God.
5096400	5097800	This segment's going long.
5097800	5098800	That's all right.
5098800	5099800	It's the last.
5099800	5100800	We got a little time, right?
5100800	5101800	You guys are okay?
5101800	5102800	All right.
5102800	5103800	Jamie's starting to get a little restless.
5103800	5104800	We've got to wind down soon.
5104800	5105800	All right.
5105800	5106800	Hello, caller.
5106800	5107800	Please state your name.
5107800	5108800	Hello?
5108800	5109800	Hello.
5109800	5110800	Hi, caller.
5110800	5112800	Please state your name.
5112800	5114800	This is Misty.
5114800	5119440	Well, hello, Misty.
5119440	5121200	I'm glad to hear from Misty.
5121200	5122200	All right, Misty.
5122200	5130080	I know you probably went waiting forever to get in, but please state your question.
5130080	5134560	If I were to win the lottery and bribe all of your bosses with however much they need
5134560	5138320	it, would you people fucking come to ASIN?
5138320	5139320	I want to.
5139320	5140320	Hi.
5140320	5143840	I have been... How long have I been talking to you?
5143840	5144840	Oh, sweetie.
5144840	5145840	I love you.
5145840	5146840	No, no, no, no, no.
5146840	5147840	This is Misty.
5147840	5148840	She's special.
5148840	5149840	Fine.
5149840	5151840	I have my finger on the Hangout button as much as I love Misty.
5151840	5152840	Yep, yep.
5152840	5153840	She got her chance.
5153840	5154840	All right.
5154840	5155840	Hold on.
5155840	5159200	Jamie is giving a pass, so she can finish her thought.
5159200	5165120	I really, really want to go to ASIN, and I've been bringing this up since last year, that
5165120	5170580	we need to get our asses to Chicago and go to convention, and I actually need to finish
5170580	5174120	one of my costumes to actually be able to wear it there, but... And I also want to
5174120	5177120	go hang out in Artist Alley with Meg Z and Chris, because they're going to be there this
5177120	5178320	year too.
5178320	5183120	Honestly, I would be going this year if it wasn't for my medical issues.
5183120	5187040	I really was considering going this year and making it happen, but my medical issues have
5187040	5188280	made me think twice about it.
5188280	5190460	It's very unfortunate, but I don't know.
5190460	5194280	If a miracle pulls through in the next week, I might reconsider, but right now, I have
5194280	5195680	to say no.
5195680	5199840	Loki, any chance in hell you'd go to ASIN, even if she won the lottery and paid for it
5199840	5200840	for you?
5200840	5204760	Even if she won the lottery, my wife is... I can't go, because my wife can't stay home
5204760	5205760	alone.
5205760	5206760	Can I represent us at ASIN?
5206760	5207760	Ha, ha, ha.
5207760	5208760	Oh, sure.
5208760	5209760	Go for it.
5209760	5210760	All right.
5210760	5214160	Besides, I'm going... If someone pays my way, I'll go to ASIN.
5214160	5215160	All right.
5215160	5216160	Thank you for the call.
5216160	5218160	Everyone give Misty a kiss.
5218160	5219160	Bye, Misty.
5219160	5220160	All right.
5220160	5221160	All right.
5221160	5222160	All right.
5222160	5223160	All right.
5223160	5224160	All right.
5224160	5225160	Fun fact from Bobby Black Wolf.
5225160	5228480	All games radio was on live 365 in one of its incarnations.
5228480	5233360	In fact, they used to give people the link to OLR to test the live 365 player.
5233360	5234360	Wow.
5234360	5235360	That's great.
5235360	5238880	So, you know, isn't it funny how things come full circle?
5238880	5239880	All right.
5239880	5240880	Maybe one more.
5240880	5241880	One more.
5241880	5243280	1877 game OLR.
5243280	5247400	I wanted to get Misty in, because I know she doesn't get to listen to live much, and I
5247400	5248400	wanted to get her.
5248400	5250560	That's why I gave Misty the pass, because she's special.
5250560	5251560	All right.
5251560	5252560	It's a girl thing.
5252560	5253560	Admit it.
5253560	5254560	All right.
5254560	5255560	Oop.
5255560	5256560	Here we go.
5256560	5257560	One more.
5257560	5258560	Last call.
5258560	5259560	Last question.
5259560	5260560	Guess what?
5260560	5261560	You're the last one.
5261560	5262560	Please state your name.
5262560	5263560	DT.
5263560	5264560	Hello, DT.
5264560	5269120	First off, we all need to tip our hat to Dark Tetsuya for a moment and praise him for the
5269120	5273920	work he's done for our station, because he's been listening here since episode one.
5273920	5275720	He's been a longtime supporter.
5275720	5280080	He writes website articles for our front page, even when the damn thing is deader than a
5280080	5281120	doornail.
5281120	5283720	He has updated the OLR Wiki with articles.
5283720	5285920	He keeps things posted on the forum.
5285920	5289040	Please, everybody, let's give Dark Tetsuya a round of applause for the hard work he's
5289040	5293040	done for our station.
5293040	5298200	Now, you're not allowed to cry or anything, because that would be more than a question.
5298200	5301560	There's more, too, because remember all the stuff he did for Sac Bay money before that.
5301560	5302560	That's true.
5302560	5307160	He's a very hardworking, fine young lad, and we're glad to have him on board.
5307160	5308160	You better believe it.
5308160	5310560	We're going to find something for you to do on our new home.
5310560	5315960	You know what I should have put on, the things to say with Live 365, they'd get me a better
5315960	5316960	chair.
5316960	5320880	Look, the man has waited all night to get through.
5320880	5322160	He's the last call.
5322160	5327120	Dark Tetsuya, please, the last question of the night for Last Orange Lounge.
5327120	5332720	Okay, let me set this up.
5332720	5345840	As you know, she's planning on coming to California in October.
5345840	5349240	Would there be a chance of getting her on the show somehow?
5349240	5352280	Is she going to be here on a Sunday?
5352280	5354280	Or an I?
5354280	5358840	Is she going to be here on a Sunday?
5358840	5359840	I think.
5359840	5360840	Okay.
5360840	5361840	Let's find out.
5361840	5362840	Abso-fricking-lutely.
5362840	5363840	Abso-fricking-lutely.
5363840	5366800	If you and Misty together, we'd love to have that on the show.
5366800	5367800	Absolutely.
5367800	5369920	If she's here on a Sunday, you guys can be here live.
5369920	5370920	You know what?
5370920	5374840	Even if she can't be here on a Sunday for whatever travel reasons, we will figure out
5374840	5378520	a tape segment just for you guys, because you've been so supportive of the show, and
5378520	5379800	it's five and a half years.
5379800	5380800	So there you have it.
5380800	5381800	Wow.
5381800	5382800	Thank you.
5382800	5383800	All right.
5383800	5384800	You're welcome.
5384800	5386800	It's been a dream of mine.
5386800	5390400	Oh, Dark Tetsuya, you know I love you, but that was more than a question.
5390400	5391400	Have a good night.
5391400	5392400	All right.
5392400	5393400	Anyhow.
5393400	5397400	Oh, that was a fun segment.
5397400	5400760	God, I hope I didn't ruin his moment or whatever.
5400760	5402400	Of course they can come on the show.
5402400	5403400	Of course.
5403400	5404400	We want them.
5404400	5405400	I would be pissed if they didn't.
5405400	5406400	Mm-hmm.
5406400	5408280	I would be so pissed if they didn't.
5408280	5409280	So yes.
5409280	5410280	We'll make it work one way or the other.
5410280	5411280	Absolutely.
5411280	5412280	All right.
5412280	5413280	Damn.
5413280	5415120	That's a lot of calls tonight, and I think it's time to wrap things up.
5415120	5417160	We already did last minute stories.
5417160	5419060	Oh my God.
5419060	5420440	We missed one thing, though.
5420440	5424680	I was supposed to do it after the list list tonight, and I completely glossed over it.
5424680	5427560	What segment did I forget, boys and girls?
5427560	5428560	What segment did we forget?
5428560	5429560	FUs of the Week.
5429560	5430560	Yes.
5430560	5431560	The FUs of the Week.
5431560	5432560	Roar.
5432560	5433560	All right.
5433560	5434560	I've got to get the music.
5434560	5435560	Holy crap.
5435560	5436560	Wouldn't that be hilarious?
5436560	5441560	Ro's been an FU to Life 365, so whatever.
5441560	5442560	Okay.
5442560	5445760	Hold on really quickly, because I've got to set this up here, and so you may hear just
5445760	5446760	a moment of silence.
5446760	5450160	Actually, I'll let the music play for a little bit.
5450160	5459520	Let the music play.
5459520	5467320	Here it is, the FUs of the Week.
5467320	5468320	Dark Soccer.
5468320	5469320	Start us off.
5469320	5470320	Fuck you, Life 365.
5470320	5471320	Loki.
5471320	5473320	Fuck you, Life 365.
5473320	5474320	Drew.
5474320	5477000	Fuck you, Life 365.
5477000	5478000	Rice Princess.
5478000	5481440	Fuck you, Life 365.
5481440	5483240	Silent Nathan.
5483240	5494880	And my FU of the Week, FU, Life 365, for upping your rates and using scare tactics to motivate
5494880	5501600	it, and FU the RIA, yes, for starting the whole damn thing in the first place.
5501600	5505560	And honestly, this all goes back to you assholes forgetting our names.
5505560	5511520	No, actually, I've got to say in seriousness, we have met some good people at Life 365,
5511520	5512520	so I don't...
5512520	5513520	I'm sorry, Betty.
5513520	5514520	She was a real sweetheart.
5514520	5515520	Yeah.
5515520	5516520	There are some great people, so...
5516520	5517520	And I've got speakers.
5517520	5522920	When we say FU, we mean to the corporate decisions that were made there, and not necessarily
5522920	5523920	the people.
5523920	5527000	Just want to get that out there, because in our five and a half years, we have interacted
5527000	5531400	with a lot of great people and other broadcasters that we've met through Life 365, so please
5531400	5533480	don't misappropriate our angst.
5533480	5534760	All right.
5534760	5541200	So anyhow, that brings us to the very last part where we give our final thoughts.
5541200	5544640	Nathan, any final thoughts?
5544640	5546840	Rice Princess, your final thought?
5546840	5548200	Yay.
5548200	5551040	Drew, your final thought?
5551040	5552040	Indignation.
5552040	5554040	Loki, your final thought?
5554040	5558960	My final thought is I need to play some more games other than Saints Row, although I may
5558960	5561520	go back to Saints Row to finish the activities.
5561520	5564760	Got to get them achievement points.
5564760	5571960	My FU of the Wii...I'm sorry, not my FU of the Wii.
5571960	5575880	My final thought is I really don't want it to flare up again and end up in the hospital.
5575880	5581440	I hate to sound like a baby in a hypochondriac, but keep your fingers crossed for me, kid.
5581440	5582440	All right.
5582440	5583440	Ferret is next.
5583440	5585440	Ferret, your final thought, please?
5585440	5588160	All right, Dark...All right, shut up.
5588160	5589160	You had two final thoughts.
5589160	5590920	Dark Sakura, your final thought?
5590920	5592640	Reject false icons.
5592640	5594480	All right.
5594480	5599800	That's going to do it for Orange Lounge Radio, the last live program here on our network
5599800	5601360	on Live 365.
5601360	5608240	Thank you to all that have supported us since May 22nd, I want to say, of 2002 when the
5608240	5616200	stream went live and June 23rd of 2002 when episode one of Orange Lounge Radio first aired.
5616200	5622480	You guys have helped make us probably the longest...one of, if not the longest running
5622480	5628920	video game podcasts and video game radio programs in the world.
5628920	5632200	We just want to thank all you guys for your support and it's all of you that have helped
5632200	5636720	make this happen, all you guys in chat, all you guys on the forums, all you guys on Live
5636720	5641140	Journal, Myspace, Facebook, and everybody that downloads this show, thank you for five
5641140	5642140	and a half years.
5642140	5647320	It has been fun on our own stream, but the party ain't over and we look forward to the
5647320	5648920	next chapter of Orange Lounge Radio.
5648920	5650480	That was a really big chapter one.
5650480	5651980	This is like War and Peace right here.
5651980	5659100	We look forward to the next chapter of OLR when we combine forces with all games radio
5659100	5664320	and come together to make the Voltron of independent gaming podcasting.
5664320	5669340	And remember, if you like what you hear, tell a couple of friends about Orange Lounge Radio.
5669340	5675460	It's word of mouth that helps makes everything go around and brings more listeners to us
5675460	5679760	so that we can slowly take over the world.
5679760	5682560	Can I rant anymore or is that it?
5682560	5683560	Are we done?
5683560	5684560	Are we out of here?
5684560	5685560	Sure.
5685560	5686560	We done.
5686560	5687560	Goodbye Live 365.
5687560	5688560	Bye.
