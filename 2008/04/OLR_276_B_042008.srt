for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening, April 20th, 2008,

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,500
with episode number 276 of our show.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,000
We are live on allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 p.m. Pacific,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, come join us for live taping if you've never been here before.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I do know we have some new faces in our chat, so thanks so much to all you guys in chat.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,500
I think as we are making our presence more known on allgames.com,

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
and people are realizing they don't have to register anymore to listen,

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
and it's really, really easy to get into our show just by going to allgames.com in your browser.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,500
I think we're getting more and more, so thanks to all you guys who have tuned in

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
and helped made our show a success.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,500
If you haven't listened to part A yet, why not?

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
You should go back in the archives and listen to part A.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
We talked about Soul Caliber coming to Xbox Live Arcade,

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
and our dreams to have Guitar Caliber, you know,

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
follow up with what we had on Rod Caliber on the Dreamcast.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
For those of you listening live, though, you already heard it,

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
and you've been sitting through music, right, waiting for us to get back to some gaming news.

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
So, let's get to it, Loki. How about some gaming news?

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,500
Yes. So, there are some rumors with the exclusive download content coming to Grand Theft Auto IV for the Xbox 360 version.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,000
There's kind of a wonder, what the hell is the download content going to be?

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,500
Well, according to CVG's recent Grand Theft Auto IV Collector's Edition magazine,

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:51,000
the Xbox 360 download content could be whole new cities.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,500
They were saying, of course, to call games as vastly ambitious as Vice City and San Andreas

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,000
mere expansion packs seems childish, but nevertheless, the downloadable content DLC

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,500
coming from the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto IV has repositioned those games in just this way.

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,000
Download content so far has meant the odd new car, jumper of a bit horse armor,

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and then they said, but Grand Theft Auto IV is set to completely redefine the idea of

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
expansions with Grand Theft Auto IV, what Vice City or San Andreas were to Grand Theft Auto III.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes, Rockstar is clearly hinting at new downloadable cities,

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and chances of them being London, Vice City, or San Andreas are slim to none.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, that's new as brand new.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Grand Theft Auto IV's Liberty City is just the beginning. Think about that and get excited.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So, since this new Grand Theft Auto game is supposed to be a parody of New York City, right?

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Are we going to get Upstate New York as the expansions?

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Maybe, you know.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Or Jersey? Grand Theft Jersey?

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,500
I don't think they're going to just replace Vice City or something like that with downloadable content.

43
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Grand Theft Auto Poughkeepsie?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I think we could see additions to the game, because obviously they can only fit so much on that disc.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So, I could see expansions to the current city, like outskirts type stuff,

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
but I don't know about like, you know, Grand Theft Auto London,

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
like you'd be able to fly to another city or something like that from the airport,

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but that'd be pretty cool if you could.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't know. You never know.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, what about just being able to cross through the tunnel and you go into Grand Theft Auto Jersey,

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and the Xbox comes with a new attachment that will make your entire house smell like New Jersey.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I hope not.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Kidding! I love Jersey. Love you guys.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Couldn't resist a cheap swipe, though.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And of course, everybody in chat is now just getting in on it saying,

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Grand Theft Auto Newark, Grand Theft Auto Mount Vernon.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So, I don't know. What are your thoughts, Loki?

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do you think there's any possible legitimacy to this?

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't think it's going to be as ambitious as, say, a brand new city,

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
but I think that they will add portions of the map or add new stuff as far as like...

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Maybe new islands? Maybe little things?

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Originally, they said it was going to be episodic content,

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
so I could see new missions or something like that for the game.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know about whole new portions of the map.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That'd be kind of big.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Very ambitious.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And I don't know why they would...

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I guess $50 million is a lot of money to convince them to make these things

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
exclusively for the Xbox 360 version.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're right. $15 million is a lot of money.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I would think also, if that were going to be the case,

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
if they were going to be getting full downloadable islands and stuff like that,

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
wouldn't Microsoft be going,

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hey, guess what? They're going to get full downloadable cities.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Buy our version.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey, wait a minute. I got it.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If Grand Theft Auto is getting downloadable islands from New York,

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Grand Theft Auto, Fire Island.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Fire Island?

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll let you think about that one for a little while.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Meanwhile, this is all kinds of cool and actually kind of funny and ironic.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Remember when we were talking about how Orange Lawns Radio was coming to all games?

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And by the way, I didn't mention this earlier in the show,

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
because I don't have details yet, but I will mention this now.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Travis Donovan Live, our buddy who was on Orange Lawns Radio

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
on Saturday nights on the old stream of this,

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
he is coming to all games. We know that much.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't know details yet, but we know he is making the move to all games.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And so collectively with us moving and Travis moving

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and Bobby already being there and all the other shows,

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and now there's a new show, there's the electric system.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, isn't Travis Donovan going to be doing something with DMN anyways?

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, well, I think the new show is then partnered up,

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
but shh, I don't, shh, secret, I don't know the details yet.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Anyhow, we refer to it as the Voltron of podcasting, right?

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The Voltron of gaming podcasting.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And ironically enough, what came to Xbox Live Marketplace this week?

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Voltron. And Voltron has a free episode available on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You kind of have to dig for it, but it's there.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There's a free episode of Voltron available.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I know you like free stuff, so go check that out.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Unfortunately, it's not in HD. It's in all its 80s SD glory.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But come on, it's Voltron.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It is Voltron.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And it's free.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Now, naturally, you could get the same damn thing,

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
probably just downloading it from BitTorrent.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But come on, why not support Voltron?

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Support free.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I support free unless it's yours.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And you know, I think Microsoft did this on purpose, actually.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's proof that Microsoft is indeed listening to everything.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Exactly, and that's exactly why they need to give me the Grand Theft Auto 4 Elite Console.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't know any nicer way to say this to you.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're ineligible, and you're not going to ever be eligible.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And if you fucking try to enter this in a fake name or something,

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
you will be caught, and you will be made fun of.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I will not.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
By the way, if you haven't heard, we're giving away an Xbox 360 Elite with the rest of all games.com.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Details are in part A. We'll give you more details next week.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Meanwhile, let's move on with the gaming news past Voltron.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It looks like that EA is going to be releasing Rock Band on PS3, PS2, and Wii in Europe for...

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Wow, did that just shock you into dropping your water?

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes, I was so shocked, I actually just dropped my water.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No, I'm just a klutz.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It'll be coming out on August 29th.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That means that basically Xbox 360 is going to go,

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
well, crap, we're not the only ones anymore over there.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Crap, crap, crap, crap.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No one will care because Saints Row 2 will come out around the same time,

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and that game is far superior.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Actually, I will say this, do you realize, Loki, and this did shock me into dropping my water,

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
there are a couple people in chat who have just said this,

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
if I win the 360, I'll give it to Loki.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And I can't stop them from doing that.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I mean, if they win it and they decide they're going to give it to you as a Christmas present,

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
but I tell you what, you owe them the tingle outfit if they do that for you.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You fucking owe it to them to do the tingle outfit.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Bet be damned.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
If one of these people wins the Xbox for you, you owe it to society to do the tingle outfit.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You wish.

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think that if they win...

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm trying to give them around this roundabout way.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I deserve that system because I love Grand Theft Auto that much.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But do you love tingle that much?

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't love tingle that much, and you know what?

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They should give it to me.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They have 500 other systems.

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why the fuck are they being so stingy with them?

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And Misty sums up my thoughts exactly in chat.

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
She says, fuck that. Give it to me.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's what I was just sitting over here saying.

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Give it to me if you're going to give it to somebody.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It has to go in the collection.

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You don't play Grand Theft Auto.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I have.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You have.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
She wants to suck it into her bored collective of gaming crap that is her house.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It has to become part of the vault.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And people are really...

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
People think I'm joking when I call it the vault, but no.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Dan calls it the vault.

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Everybody calls it the vault.

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We need that for the vault.

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I did enter a contest.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I was going to talk about this a little later.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But you know with that...

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Was it the Rockstar Social Club that they have now?

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Their cool little tracking service and stuff.

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The first contest that they have is you'll win...

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Enter a chance to win a piece of artwork that's your likeness done in the Grand Theft Auto cover style.

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's kind of cool.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Of course, if I want that done, I could probably just do it myself.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
See, this is the type of person that does not appreciate a Grand Theft Auto 4 elite system.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Alright, get past it, people. Get past it.

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Alright, do we finish up with the Rock Band news?

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I apologize, I got derailed by the...

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Actually, there's one more bit about that.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What's that?

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I just thought that it might be interesting that...

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The ferret can't fucking win that system either, just for the record.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Neither can any of his family.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Which, by the way, I would like to know if there is still another ferret attached to a Katamari somewhere in Namco's headquarters.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You know what, I got a pretty sizable present for Amazon for my birthday.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I might order another ferret if they still own Amazon.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Lordy.

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's the last thing we need on OLRs for the ferrets to mate.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Please, back to gaming, Loki.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We need mini ferrets.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Save our show, Loki.

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Many, many ferrets.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Unfortunately, you know, it was the KB Toys.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They had the KB Toy outlet.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Actually, the KB Toys weren't outlet enough.

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's where I got the last of the ferrets.

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Unfortunately, they weren't anymore.

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I actually had to cut them open to put new batteries in them because the geniuses that they are didn't make an opening for batteries.

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Anyways, Splinter Cell, Chaos Theory, and Metal Arms are coming to Xbox Live Originals.

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You can get both of those games available for 1200 Microsoft points.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They're going to be on there actually tomorrow or Monday.

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And, yeah, that's pretty awesome.

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They're going to be available everywhere except for Korea and Japan.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No Splinter Cell, Chaos Theory for Korea or Japan.

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm sorry to derail the show again, but I have to.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Jamie, you have to check out the link I just posted in chat.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I typed Skoozie, which is the name of the little pet.

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I typed it into Google, and the first thing that came up was a real ferret versus a Skoozie.

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And there's some really cute pictures in here of the ferret cuddling up with the Skoozie.

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So you have to check that out.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And then it looks like he's trying to eat it in one of those pictures.

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I like that one because it looks like the ferret has the Skoozie on his head.

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And it reminds me of the bunny with the pancake on its head.

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh, I love it. It's so cute.

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Rob, I want a ferret, okay?

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And look at the little fangies on the ferret.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, we have an update from Black Wolf about Loki's eligibility for the contest.

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Here's the official word from Lord Bobby Black Wolf.

219
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I think that's his official title over at AllGames.com.

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He's Lord Bobby Black Wolf.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He says, maybe I'll let Loki enter the contest if he wears a tingle costume to the next two OLRs and sit on the cam the entire time, no hiding.

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No! That is not acceptable.

223
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You dare say no to Lord Bobby?

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Do not belittle my Grand Theft Auto fanboyism, okay?

225
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I know he's going to try and do it too. He's going to try to enter as somebody else or send it to his friend.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
See, that's where you forget. I am more lazy than you will ever believe.

227
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So, do I really have time to make something and send it in? No.

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Alright, I'm sorry. Alright, look. Back to gaming news. We gotta get past this.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Mailbag is coming up as well if you have emails to send in. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is a cool sounding game in name alone. It's Afro Samurai.

231
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You might notice an animated series that has Samuel L. Jackson doing some voices in it.

232
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Xbox 360 and PS3 is getting a version of Afro Samurai this fall.

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And the game will follow Afro as he is seeking revenge for the murder of his father.

234
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And he is, quote, fighting to become the number one warrior.

235
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The game will follow the storyline in the series.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And, you know, you just want to know if Samuel L. Jackson is going to be doing the dialogue.

237
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
He is. So there you have it. The musical score will also be done by RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan.

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Sweet.

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So it sounds pretty authentic. If you're a fan of the show, you will probably be a fan of the game Afro Samurai.

240
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But if you hate it, then, well, you probably won't want it.

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There was actually an art book for it at Kinokuniya yesterday when I was there.

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Cool. Do they have a Japanese version?

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't know. But I saw an art book. So it's kind of cool.

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Pretty cool.

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
All right. Well, it's time for that part of the show where you guys get to interact with us, not just through the chat room.

246
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We also have our Skype line. We just have many different ways you can interact with the show.

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Because, you know, OLR is all about giving every gamer a voice. And many voices coming into our mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

248
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Dark Soccer is going to reach into the mailbag and pull out a favorite email of hers and read it right now.

249
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Or two or five.

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We have actually a few.

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
First email, dun dun dun, from Geronimo.

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It says, hello, OLR.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
While I wasn't surprised with the story the other week about one kid shooting his friend over not getting his turn while playing a video game, I did realize this.

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The media says that video games promote violence and it really seems like they only promote gun violence.

255
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Or the media only covers gun violence.

256
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Has anyone been, has there ever been a story about one person beating another person to death after playing Tekken?

257
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't think so.

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Has anybody tried to use the Kalamitic symphony on their friend when they lose in Soul Calibur?

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No. But kudos to anyone who can do that in the real world.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Has anyone been beat over the head with a shovel after playing Viva Pinata?

261
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Nuh uh.

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So do you think that when people say games promote violence, do you think that they should say that they promote gun violence instead?

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Because it seems like that is the only violent action people take and blame on games.

264
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Or people should just stop blaming it singly on games and maybe consider it's the whole picture.

265
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You know, when I say the whole picture, I mean all forms of movies and other types of entertainment.

266
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Most importantly, when the parents aren't watching and not telling their kids what's right and wrong.

267
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There's already freakin' problems with the kids.

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You know, put them in the institution.

269
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Since you don't want to do your damn job anyway.

270
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Send them to boot camp. Call Maury.

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Um, next email from GS68 says, hey Loki, hey Jamie, hey bla bla bla bla bla.

272
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Um. Hi.

273
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I come once again to bring up the issue of recent games being too easy.

274
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Perhaps this is what gamers want.

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I've noticed that, for example, the House of the Dead 2 and 3 return is not getting a lot of good reception because of its limited continues.

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Compare this to Ghost Squad, which has unlimited continues, which I don't see anyone whining about.

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
In fact, many welcome it as it allows them to never die.

278
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So games may be getting easier, yes, but is this a good thing to make games less frustrating so that more can enjoy them?

279
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
P.S. This email was brought to you by Olive Garden, a home of never-ending boots to the head.

280
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I would be surprised if there wasn't some type of code or something that comes out later that's going to give that game the unlimited continues or what have you.

281
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And actually, I kind of think that might be the way to do it.

282
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Is maybe slowly, you know, a type of game, I think the best types of games are the ones that have a sort of accordion difficulty.

283
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Where, you know, the better you are at it, the harder it gets.

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But the more the game realizes you suck at it, the more it takes pity on you and lets you beat it eventually.

285
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You know what I mean?

286
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So I'm hoping there's something maybe that will come out for that a little later for those folks that are whining.

287
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's too difficult because some people, some people just want to blast through it to say they blast through it.

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But then, of course, I understand there's the hardcore gamers that want to say they did it and they were first too.

289
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If that makes sense.

290
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So next email then.

291
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Sure.

292
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This is Dear Orange Lounge Radio.

293
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I have no gamertag or ID.

294
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I mainly played handheld and the Wii.

295
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm fortunate that I have a job where I am required to sit and wait for action.

296
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So I get through my fair share of handheld games.

297
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm a big fan of listening to you for over a year now.

298
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I am a tart of a listener listening to over a dozen gaming podcasts regularly.

299
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I find it interesting to see how when a story appears on one side, it dissipates through the others.

300
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oops, that was an accident.

301
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I didn't mean to hit the ferret.

302
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm often smirky at your I wish statements.

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I remember a few weeks back on one of your future wishes was a TV on your mobile.

304
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Here in the UK, I have that for over 50 pence for a 24 hour period.

305
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I can watch actual television or I can play monthly fee for less overall.

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Covering the major terrestrial channels and MTV, etc.

307
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Also, in this week's part A, number 275, you mentioned, why can't I have one?

308
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Can I jump in real quick about the TV on the mobile thing?

309
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I actually do have TV on my mobile, but it sucks.

310
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And you only get limited channels, which are practically infomercials.

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's not at the same level that it's at in other countries yet.

312
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The technology is years behind here.

313
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It leaves a lot to be desired.

314
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I know, it's because people have their heads up their asses.

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But moving forward, also in this week's part A, number 275, you mentioned, why can't I have a white wave bird with rumble?

316
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I've had one for over six months.

317
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Some of the major gaming store chains in the UK have an official one, see link below.

318
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And that is www.game.co.uk slash Wii slash hardware slash accessory slash tilde R330970 slash gameware dash Wii dash wireless dash GameCube dash control dash pad.

319
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Just go to game.co.uk and look in the Wii section.

320
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It works perfectly as I bought a wave bird for when Brawl comes out over here.

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And out of the two, I prefer the white game controller as it has the rumble.

322
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,000
At 15 pounds, 30 pounds, my apologies, at 13 pounds, 30 dollars, I think is very reasonable.

323
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm also favoring the wheel on Mario karts.

324
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm averaging a third or fourth place online and winning all of my races offline so far.

325
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What I've also liked was when I first went online with my Wii, I forgot to stop my PC hogging the internet.

326
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And was thrown off during early setup stages.

327
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I was automatically penalized about 40 points.

328
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Although this hurt, I was delighted to see that if you drop off as a bad sport, it will cost you on your achievement score.

329
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Cheers Mark from Plymouth.

330
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm glad for the penalties as well when you drop out of there.

331
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
This is funny. This is from Plymouth, England, where the Mayflower set off.

332
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
In fact, my local pub is called the Mayflower.

333
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Nice.

334
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Some good perspectives from overseas.

335
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, you have to remember sometimes the peripherals are different from one side of the pond to the other.

336
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I didn't even think that probably Europe already has had that white.

337
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But we had a white wave. No, I guess we didn't have a white wave bird before.

338
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah, I guess we never really had a white.

339
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And it's not really the color that makes a lick of difference.

340
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's just the fact that they're kind of having a resurgence.

341
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You know, in light of the fact that the GameCube is for all practical purposes a dead system over here.

342
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
They don't really make new ones.

343
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's nice to see that they're, you know, doing the wave bird.

344
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But that is interesting that you have that particular store over in the UK.

345
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's been supporting it the whole time.

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So, there you have it.

347
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Are there more emails?

348
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
There are quite a few, actually.

349
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And moving forward.

350
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Hey, OLR, I'm writing this email on remote play on my PS3.

351
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And I want to let you guys know about a workaround for the internet browser password protection.

352
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If you go into folding at home and go to the team stats, all you have to do is find a team whose homepage links to Google.

353
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Try Google.

354
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I guess it says try Google and off you go.

355
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Particularly helpful against tech minded parents.

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oops.

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Sincerely, PK.

358
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Is it PK junior 92?

359
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes, that sounds right.

360
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I think he friended me on Myspace recently.

361
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I like his quote.

362
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It says change is inevitable except from a vending machine.

363
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I've heard that before.

364
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yes, that's a good quote.

365
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What else have I heard?

366
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Change is inevitable.

367
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Wait, no. What is it?

368
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You can avoid most things except death and taxes and sometimes you can cheat death.

369
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Something like that.

370
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's a similar quote.

371
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
In my messed up mind.

372
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Hi, OLR.

373
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I just wanted to comment on Jamie saying she didn't want her gaming system to perform as anything but gaming system.

374
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I, of course, am a PSP owner and currently that is my only system.

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The reason that it is my only system is that next gen consoles are too expensive for me right now.

376
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But I still like to play on the go and this suits me better.

377
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The multifunction of the PSP was a major selling point for me.

378
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The fact that my first introduction to OLR was on the PSP fanboy site in which they mentioned their favorite podcast and out of all the ones listed, I tried them all.

379
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
OLR was the best.

380
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Well, thank you.

381
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I have the RSS feed saved on my PSP and I plug it into my car stereo and listen to each week's show during my 30 minute commute to work all week.

382
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So in a sense, I had never heard of OLR without my PSP.

383
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Shocking, huh?

384
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And yeah, my cell phone can do a lot of that crap but it can't play a decent game.

385
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I hope Skye is feeling better.

386
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Viva la PSP.

387
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
P.S. I might own a next gen system or two if I had enough money to buy and collect some pinball machines.

388
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Haha.

389
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's from Circe 523.

390
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And by the way, the pinball machines came about because my husband got hit by a car when he was 13.

391
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Get run over by a truck.

392
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We get a little bit of money every five years.

393
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That goes to fund the pinball machine.

394
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But it's also kind of an investment thing because you can always sell those things.

395
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Well, he used a part of his money to start his collection and since then, the machines have sort of paid for themselves.

396
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I notice it's like buying a house.

397
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He'll buy a fixer upper and then fix it and then sell it for more than it was before.

398
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Which is the way to do it.

399
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And it also doesn't help that he has worked at a couple different, you know, as managers at a couple different video game stores.

400
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So we've looked into all that and all of our old stuff, we've gone to flea markets.

401
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Well, you know, as far as the PSP goes, I still appreciate it for being the multi-system that it is, doing everything that it doesn't.

402
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You kind of give an example of that is a lot of people use a PSP as kind of like their not quite iPod but, you know, MP3 playing device as it is.

403
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
My co-worker uses his for that.

404
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah.

405
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Just about only.

406
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And hey, it plays games and surfs the net too, so why not?

407
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So, yeah, you know, and especially after kind of really only having a PSP while I was on vacation this weekend.

408
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Those things can really do quite a bit.

409
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I enjoy it.

410
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And those screens are so pretty.

411
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I just can't stop saying it.

412
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Somebody, by the way, in our forums wants to create an OLR theme for the PSP.

413
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And I think there was kind of one on the OLR PSP site but I think they want one updated.

414
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, that's just a wallpapers that we have on our site.

415
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He's not, they're talking about actual theme.

416
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I thought about doing it but then again, once again, going back to how lazy I am.

417
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah.

418
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah.

419
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Well, hopefully the listeners will actually finish it.

420
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But I saw that going on on the forums so that'll be fun because you can pimp out your PSP with OLR propaganda.

421
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That's always fun.

422
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That is.

423
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And on top of that, I think that what I had clarified my statement in adding is that if what you want it for is the multiple use, that's fine but it's not a selling point for me.

424
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You know, I would rather have a system that's got more fun games on it, I think.

425
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You're just looking games to games.

426
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I think it's kind of what I pick up from what you say.

427
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You're looking at games to games.

428
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
When you look at games on the DS, you're like, that's where it's at for me.

429
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
A PSP is a primarily a gaming system.

430
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It just happens to do all this other crap.

431
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Whereas when I bought my iPhone, I bought it not just because it was a phone but because I needed a PDA.

432
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
When I bought it, it was my PDA slash phone.

433
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So, see, it just depends on the purpose you're purchasing it for.

434
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We have a couple more emails, though.

435
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Alrighty.

436
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Okay, this one comes from Robert M.

437
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I saw the Half-Life episode pack Team Fortress 2 and Portal on the retail shelves, Target specifically, and despite only having a Mac laptop right now, went ahead and looked at the system requirements.

438
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I was surprised to learn that to activate the game, you need to set up an account with Steam and register it there.

439
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So what on God's green earth is the advantage of getting it this way rather than on Steam itself?

440
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Also, as a Mac user, I'm pretty happy Sam and Mac Season 1 is coming to the Wii.

441
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I can't imagine, of course, considering the PS3 port, that'd be any chance of a Wii Portal with a weighted companion GameCube.

442
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That would be funny.

443
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That's a damn good question about Steam.

444
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I had no idea that that was part of the requirements for registering it until you sent that email.

445
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's kind of surprising.

446
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You're right. What is the damn difference? There really isn't.

447
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I don't know if they're doing that for the copy protection things or whatever it might be, but very interesting that you have to register your game on Steam.

448
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I guess, you know, there's some people, though, they don't want to put their credit card out there on the internet.

449
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So, you know, this is a way of doing it.

450
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That was for Team Fortress 2.

451
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
They just said for the orange box games.

452
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't know if they... Did he specifically say which game it was? I missed it.

453
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
He just said he grabbed one of the boxes.

454
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Well, let's assume it's probably all of them. If it's one of them, it's probably all of them.

455
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Well, I don't know.

456
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm trying to find the email again. There we go.

457
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
RawsteelUT says to prevent early release.

458
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I can't really see that, though, because the games have been on Steam forever.

459
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And it happens to all Half-Life 2 games.

460
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's marketing. It really is just marketing, I think.

461
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You know, you put something... The more something is out there, the more people are going to see it. That's all.

462
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, plus it helps that Valve owns Steam.

463
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I mean, don't question it. It's probably some type of...

464
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And Steam is probably... They're probably just using Steam in general as their registration source.

465
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I mean, because...

466
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I honestly would rather have the physical copy, I think, than having downloaded it.

467
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I totally get what this guy is saying, though.

468
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But I don't mind registering it online.

469
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But what if you do?

470
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
What if you don't want to put your information out there and all that stuff?

471
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You know, some people don't want to give that stuff away.

472
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So it does kind of suck that they're being forced to do it.

473
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Well, you have to... If you buy Photoshop, you have to register it and send them all your information.

474
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You know, if you buy... When you buy The Sims, you have to register it.

475
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
When you play World of Warcraft, you set up an account.

476
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah, but... Okay, but I'm thinking... I don't know.

477
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Maybe I'm just going back to the old school.

478
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay, if I walked in and I bought Orange Box for the Xbox 360, sure, I get that little registration card.

479
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But half of us throw those things away.

480
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You just plop it in, you go. No questions asked.

481
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't know, but then again, maybe it's stealing everything from Xbox Live. I don't know.

482
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
See, I think part of the whole reason why they're being a little bit more on it with the registration

483
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
is just to make sure that you don't have a pirated copy, that your copy is legit.

484
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I don't know. I don't necessarily have a problem with it.

485
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's just I do find it kind of weird because I would understand why somebody might go to the store to buy it

486
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
because they don't want to use Steam. I use Steam. I bought Portal off Steam.

487
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I don't have a problem with it, but I could see why somebody might have bought the retail version

488
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
just not wanting to deal with that and to find out they have to deal with it anyway.

489
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Well, I guess that I can see why I might be kind of pissed.

490
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
All right, one more email.

491
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Mailbagorangelaunchradio.com. I thought you said there was one more.

492
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
No, I said there's a few more.

493
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Well, damn it.

494
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
They're kind of long, too.

495
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act deft.

496
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
First of all, and I'm going to mispronounce this because I took French, okay?

497
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Feliz Cumpleaños.

498
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Close. Feliz Cumpleaños, I think, is it.

499
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
To Jamie.

500
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You know what that means?

501
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Birthday.

502
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Happy birthday.

503
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I hope you had a great day, smiley face.

504
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I did have a good day. I was very busy.

505
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But I got free gelato at Naya.

506
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
They had Guinness gelato.

507
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Sweet.

508
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It was fucking good.

509
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Anyway, the Black Sesame was not very good.

510
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And second, because of Internet issues, I couldn't listen to the last show on live, not 365,

511
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and the first on all games.

512
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Luckily, I could get hold of the podcast and get my OLR fixed for the week,

513
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
and the show may be on another stream, but it's still as good as it ever was,

514
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and in better sound quality, too.

515
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Hearts.

516
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Now for the serious stuff.

517
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I was hearing the podcast for last week's show,

518
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and you were talking about bullies banning in Brazil,

519
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and you were asking if Latin American countries had some kind...

520
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

521
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Rob, I think I just lost my connection.

522
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So what?

523
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I just lost my interwebs.

524
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah, you know what?

525
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We're having problems.

526
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The Justin TV cam went down, too, so something is wrong with the wireless networking.

527
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So while I set up...

528
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Do you still have that one e-mail on your screen?

529
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah.

530
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Okay, so while...

531
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Keep reading that while we try to set up the jerry rig real quick.

532
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Okay.

533
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Most of the games and stuff that's sold on Latin Americans...

534
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Let me start over.

535
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Now for the serious stuff.

536
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I was hearing the podcast for last week's show,

537
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and you were talking about bullies banning in Brazil,

538
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and you were asking if Latin American countries had some kind of rating for games.

539
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Well, like Footy said last week, Chile has it,

540
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
but basically that's it.

541
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Most of the games and stuff that is sold in Latin American stores

542
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
isn't popularly rated for the audience as targeted,

543
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and only has the ESRB rating,

544
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
but still it isn't an obligatory thing for retailers to follow.

545
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So basically any child can go into the store and buy Grand Theft Auto

546
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
with no problems at all,

547
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
as a basic example since it's one of the best selling games in Latin America.

548
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Although some stores do follow that ESRB rating

549
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and do not sell an M game to a minor,

550
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
or at least younger kids,

551
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
but there aren't that many that do so,

552
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
yet it is basically up to the parents to say yes or no,

553
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
although there's another factor in play that isn't related to this,

554
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
the game's retail value.

555
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Video games in Mexico cost at least 25% more than in the US,

556
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
so video games are kind of like a luxury here.

557
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
By the way, the cheapest console is the Wii,

558
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
which costs almost double what it costs in the US.

559
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So not many people buy games,

560
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and if they do buy cheap ones,

561
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
like for example bargain bin titles or low budget ones,

562
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
which brings us to another problem, piracy.

563
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Last month I made a comment on a Skype call

564
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
that an article stating that Mexico video game industry

565
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
is going to be worth $1 billion in two years from now.

566
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Now I wonder how they're going to manage piracy in Mexico,

567
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
which is one of the worldwide leading piracy markets for almost everything,

568
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and if retailers don't care about their ratings,

569
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
well, you get the idea.

570
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
The most people or the main public are also ignorant in knowing

571
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
which are the games to get.

572
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Basically you don't know if a game is good or bad or it's just a game.

573
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Hence why titles like Cars got into the best-selling games list of 2006.

574
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The same goes for other titles like FIFA or PES

575
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and any anime game title, DBZ for example.

576
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So in the end, it's just basically a cultural thing

577
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
since most of Latin America is accustomed to different things

578
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
than the US and Canada, especially in the way media is handled.

579
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Basically you can watch someone holding and firing a gun

580
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
in daytime afternoon TV.

581
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
If you have the chance to watch any Mexican news shows or similar,

582
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
do so and you'll understand what I am talking about.

583
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
On a side note, Mexican congressmen don't want a video game,

584
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I guess don't know what a video game rating is

585
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
or since they're trying to rate games but by health issues

586
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and not by the actual contents of the game.

587
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
He actually did link a GameSpot article in Spanish,

588
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
but I wouldn't be able to read it,

589
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
but I'll put it in the chat room once I'm back in there.

590
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Well, that's all for now.

591
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'll hear you on Sunday's show. Adios.

592
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
P.S. Rob, when are we going to give away the ResHD code?

593
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You know, it's sad. I actually completely forgot about that.

594
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I know it sounds horrible, but just with everything else that had been going on,

595
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
so we will probably throw it into a future contest.

596
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I don't know, maybe we can give it away as part of this Grand Theft Auto thing as a runner-up prize.

597
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't know, we'll figure it out.

598
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But I do want to give it away.

599
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
If somebody doesn't have it by now, we need to just give it away.

600
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
At some point, we're just going to set up an email and try to get it out that way.

601
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
By the way, if you switch networks, we should be back up.

602
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
We have the Jerry Rigg network up.

603
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I have to get back in chat, so I won't be able to do it.

604
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Switcheroos!

605
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
God damn it.

606
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah, it went over one of the emails.

607
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Actually, yeah, it's been two months since it was given to me.

608
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
We haven't given it away.

609
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
The PS reminded me that Q Entertainment is doing a special kind of survey

610
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
in which you can ask Tetsuya Mizuguchi a question for their newsletter.

611
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
If you haven't already said so on the show, perhaps it's only ten questions that will be picked.

612
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
More info is on that game called res.com

613
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
slash VBulletin slash showthread dot PHP question mark T equals 90.

614
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
PSSS, Second Life on cell phones.

615
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm a furry and I find that highly hilarious.

616
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'd be curious to know from Mizuguchi if 99 Nights is something they're going to try to do again.

617
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I mean, because I know that game got a lot of slack when it first came out,

618
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
but there's a good game in there somewhere, and maybe they could get it on a second go.

619
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Otherwise, I would hope maybe they could do, I don't know, maybe Gun Pay on Xbox Live Arcade.

620
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
We'll see what happens with that.

621
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Well, we've got one more email.

622
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Is it up on the screen? No, two more emails.

623
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
We have more emails.

624
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
My God, it keeps growing.

625
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
No, it's not, it keeps growing. I told you that we had several.

626
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Okay, this one comes from Osfer, seven questions.

627
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Hey Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.

628
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
This afternoon I was bored, so I thought, what the hell, why not randomly make ten questions to ask you guys,

629
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
because you know that's the first thing that comes to everyone's mind when they're bored, right?

630
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
One, Rob.

631
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
What's your favorite galaxy in Super Mario Galaxies?

632
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And Osfer says, I love Space Junk Galaxy because it pretty much says gravity.

633
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Who gives a shit? The music is all relaxing, too.

634
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The Bumblebee Galaxy, because you can be a bumblebee, and that's the best thing in the game.

635
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I love Bee Mario.

636
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
A question for me.

637
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Jamie, what's your favorite pinball game?

638
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And he says he doesn't play much pinball, be like the Gilligan's Island machine.

639
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
World Cup Soccer 94, without a doubt.

640
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Loki, what is your favorite course out of all the Mario Kart series?

641
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And he says that he likes Rainbow Road from Mario Kart 64.

642
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I hate Mario Kart's Rainbow Road.

643
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I would say probably, I like Wario Stadium from Nintendo 64 a lot.

644
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Actually, a lot of the courses from 64 are pretty awesome.

645
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I would probably say, I don't know, probably Wario Stadium.

646
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I think that's the most that I've played, is that one.

647
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
That, and also, I don't remember what it's called.

648
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I think it was Peach's Circuit or something like that.

649
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's the one that's got the giant ramp from Nintendo 64.

650
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't know.

651
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But I'd say probably Wario Stadium.

652
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I love Toad's Highway.

653
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I know I wasn't asked this question.

654
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Toad's Highway is pretty awesome, too.

655
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Frickin' love Toad's Highway.

656
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So, I don't know.

657
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What would be your dream Mario Kart course in a future Mario game?

658
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
They should do one that's all pixelated and 8-bit like Super Mario Brothers.

659
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I think that'd be pretty cool.

660
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Nice.

661
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Mode 7-tastic.

662
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Or a better Haunted Mansion course.

663
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
One that's actually a bit of platforming stuff.

664
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That'd be pretty cool.

665
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Or one that's based...

666
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
What they need to do is add some of the characters from Mario RPG into a future one.

667
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Including that one villain guy who was raining around the entire time.

668
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Nice.

669
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't remember his name.

670
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We have a fan of Moo Moo Farm in the house.

671
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Frisbee likes Moo Moo.

672
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Is that the one with the train?

673
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I love that one.

674
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Moo Moo Farm is fun.

675
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Good times.

676
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Alright.

677
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
The next question is...

678
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
This is for all three of us.

679
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Who are your favorite Brawl characters?

680
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And Osprey says Wolf O'Donnell is mine.

681
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Obviously his howling taunt is amazing and he fights like a dream.

682
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm just gonna really go back to my favorite of all time.

683
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I was a big Sheik person.

684
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That Kirby was always my person.

685
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I think.

686
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I love Ness.

687
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But I think I'd freaking love Pit in this new one too much.

688
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Loki?

689
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
My favorite character?

690
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I liked...

691
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Actually...

692
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I liked Rob.

693
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Rob the Robot.

694
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That was fun.

695
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I like me too.

696
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm great.

697
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Next question.

698
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Yes.

699
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What would you do if World of Warcraft was shut down and you could never play it again?

700
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
He says I hate World of Warcraft.

701
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'd go back to Final Fantasy 11 just to piss you off.

702
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Here's one for me.

703
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
He says here's a toughie for you.

704
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
In the end what console do you think will come out on top in this gens console?

705
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Wars PS3 360 or the Wii?

706
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And he thinks it's between the 360 and the Wii but I'll have to say Wii.

707
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I love my PS3 but...

708
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah.

709
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
360.

710
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Just because it's got the online play perfect.

711
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Well, as perfect as it can be given current technology.

712
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's got a really great library.

713
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Lots of stuff that's for people of any age and, you know, type of game that they like.

714
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's pretty versatile, I'd have to say.

715
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So I'm going to say the 360 in terms of...

716
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
First of all, it already had an audience when it came out.

717
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And secondly, the learning curve was really, really small on it.

718
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So...

719
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I think I'm right.

720
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Alrighty.

721
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Last question for Loki.

722
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You get the last one.

723
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
What is your favorite game and why?

724
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And he says Final Fantasy X is the only game to ever make me pull an all-nighter so I'd

725
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
have to say that and the runner-up is Brawl.

726
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Well, I don't know.

727
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It depends when you ask me.

728
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Well, if you're asking me now, I'd probably say...

729
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is pretty fun.

730
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I don't know.

731
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I play a lot of things for O.

732
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't have a favorite game.

733
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't like to pick one that's just favorite.

734
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Because I go from one to another, you know, all the time.

735
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But...

736
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, I'd say right now Saints Row.

737
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But I know that's not my absolute favorite.

738
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
My favorite game is Super Metroid, but most of Chad already knew that.

739
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Well, you know what mine is.

740
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Alright.

741
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Guardian Legend!

742
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So enough of wasting your time.

743
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I went about that faceplate.

744
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Take your time with it and I understand you guys have enough to manage.

745
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm still working on getting one, but I think someone else is supposed to bring one.

746
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And I've got all the stuff to work on it.

747
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
We'll figure it out.

748
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
We'll talk amongst ourselves.

749
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Thanks for reading, Oscar.

750
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
P.S. Rob, I hope your pancreas get better.

751
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I hope so too.

752
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I wish you would come to ASEN, cries.

753
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I wish you would come to ASEN as well.

754
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
However, Penny Arcade Expo is like 95% certain for me at this point.

755
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
The last email.

756
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Thank god, I mean...

757
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Holy shit!

758
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Thank you, RawstillUT.

759
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Is it long?

760
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Yes.

761
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm gonna read it though.

762
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Duke Cliff Notes.

763
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
DC vs. Mortal Kombat.

764
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
A horrifying concept not because of graphics.

765
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Mortal Kombat hasn't used mocap graphics in ages.

766
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I was bringing that up as an example.

767
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But because, according to Kotaku, there isn't going to be any fatalities.

768
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The blood will be incredibly limited.

769
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Why the hell would anyone bother?

770
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I think we've covered that.

771
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Well, the fighting styles...

772
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
However, that wasn't the main topic I wanted to discuss.

773
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
The idea of higher meaning in games.

774
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Meaning in art in general.

775
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You often hear complaints from gamers about games not having esoteric higher meaning compared to other mediums.

776
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
However, many people bring up movies, books, paintings that are either A, really blatant in their meetings.

777
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Schindler's List, Blood Diamond.

778
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Or B, way too damned esoteric and oddball for anyone to get on their own, which is Akira.

779
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
By the way, in defense of Akira, it was a cliff note version of a really freaking long manga that...

780
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm not even going to go into it, just read the manga.

781
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
My view has always been that if it's too complex for someone to get without a fucking explanation by the creator, it isn't worth the time.

782
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
By the same... Well, you should watch Shock Treatment then.

783
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Then you'll find out what...

784
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
By the way, this Friday, April 25th in San Francisco, Shock Treatment.

785
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'm not performing in it anymore, though, due to my sickness.

786
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I couldn't do rehearsals.

787
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But I'm still going.

788
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
My view has always been that if... Okay, I've read that part.

789
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,000
By the same token, hammering someone over the head with a message and not leaving room for subtle metaphor and commenting comes off as preachy,

790
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
a primary reason I can barely stand Kojima's sledgehammer style in the Metal Gear Solid series.

791
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I've always thought that a metaphor, hence an innuendo, made the best way to convey a message in entertainment media.

792
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Look at the way humans generally have distrust of aliens and vice versa in Mass Effect, for example.

793
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
While a cliché in and of itself, the way it's presented shows just how ugly racism is.

794
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Final Fantasy VII had a very strong pro-environment message hidden in the belts and zippers of Nomura's design,

795
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:01,000
with Mako and the Lifestream an effective metaphor for the oil we've ripped from the earth and the land and animals we routinely exploit.

796
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Often there is something to be taken other than simple entertainment if you look hard enough.

797
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And it's also sometimes small meanings can be found in even the most mundane parts of games.

798
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
For example, there's a part in Rainbow Six Vegas 2 where, warning spoilers, your team is sent in to check three buildings for a bomb.

799
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Should I read this?

800
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Who cares? Just try to sum it up in one sentence. I don't know.

801
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It's basically dealing with having to deal with a failure instead of it being a game over.

802
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Instead of game over, start over. You failed. You have to deal with it.

803
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I would like to see a video game tell you that. You fail at life. Deal with it.

804
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Oh my god, they set us up the bomb.

805
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
It's more like you fail. Here's your consequences for what you screwed up on.

806
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I often wonder if the call for higher meaning in games is just from people who want to join the stuck up art connoisseur club.

807
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Me, I've always found the word art to be nothing more than something old, rich, often white men used to hold up what they prefer while simultaneously putting down anything made by the lower classes as being unworthy of the art designation.

808
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's not surprising. In his time, William Shakespeare was considered a lowbrow playwright.

809
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Now, hundreds of years after his death, he's considered one of the greatest playwrights of all time.

810
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
What isn't heralded for all time won't be decided by us, but by those who come long after and look back.

811
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Maybe one day, stuck up elites will hold up lost odyssey and no more heroes as a pinnacle of art and gaming. Just something to think about.

812
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You know, that's a very interesting point, I must say.

813
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's going to be very interesting to see what kind of games are truly remembered as classics and will it be the things that were necessarily popular today. I don't know.

814
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Another aside, I love the new PlayStation Store. It's even better than Marketplace now.

815
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So easy to find everything in the games installed automatically now. It's wonderful.

816
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Finally, and yes I know I'm rambling, here's another anti-digital distribution warning.

817
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Way back in 1981, a service called Play Cable came out which allowed you to download Intellivision games through your cable system.

818
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The problem is that the adapter only had 4K of RAM and when Intellivision games started coming out in 8K and 16K carts,

819
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
the Play Cable service was rendered useless and was discontinued in 1993.

820
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The moral of the story is that files will always outgrow bandwidth.

821
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Who the hell wants to download 50 gigs of Metal Gear Solid 4?

822
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
What about when games start taking up triple-even, quadruple-layer Blu-ray discs 100 gigs?

823
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Movie and game files aren't going to stand still for the sake of bandwidth, especially when ISPs are our heart set on raping consumers for bandwidth in the US, Europe, and especially Australia.

824
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Well, you're going to be seeing discs for a long, long time. You're truly Russell, UT.

825
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That is such a freakin' good letter.

826
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Alright. If you want to send us good letters, mailbag at orangelaunterator.com, but try to keep it to 500 words or less, just so we have time to read them all in the air.

827
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Send me something to drink with every email.

828
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Alright, let's get back to some gaming news.

829
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And we'll go to Loki about Bionic Commando, yes?

830
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Bionic Commando Rearmed has been rated by the ESRB. It is, of course, rated M, and they didn't really specify why it's rated M, but it, I think, has to do with the game's main villain's head exploding.

831
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Spoilers.

832
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,000
So that's pretty awesome. I just like the fact that it's rated. That means it's on its way, and hopefully will be out very soon.

833
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And along with it, hopefully will come Castle Crashers, because I hope that game's out very soon as well.

834
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Awesome.

835
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I am very excited for Bionic Commando Rearmed. It's going to be hot, because the old one is a hot game.

836
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Alright, moving on to more Grand Theft Auto stories, but this may not be exactly what you're looking for.

837
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It seems like there were a lot of pre-orders for Grand Theft Auto IV in Australia, but now Australians are starting to cancel their pre-orders big time.

838
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
This has to do with the latest censorship in the game. You remember last week we talked about the Australian version of Grand Theft Auto as being censored?

839
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And I guess it had something to do with, what was it, somebody putting a gun in somebody else's private parts or something?

840
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yes, a gun up the rectum, I believe.

841
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm sure it's hilarious. However, due to this, many Australian gamers are cancelling their orders, and this is according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

842
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Already they are pissed off, because the game is going to cost $120 versus $64, Australian.

843
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Gamers are really reacting with outrage. Gamers are saying they cancelled their orders with Australian shops and will import a cheaper uncut version.

844
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Going around the law.

845
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
That is true. PlayStation 3 is region-free, so there you go.

846
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
If you're in Australia and you want a region-free or uncut version of the game, import it.

847
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Frisbee wants to know, let me ask a question, did Saw IV get shown in Australia?

848
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Very good question. I mean, seriously.

849
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Well, this is a very interesting, though, kind of counter-reaction to this, is that you have all these people that are cancelling the game and realising that the PS3 is region-free, so they're just like, you know what, screw it, we're going to import it.

850
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Very interesting combat.

851
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Some 360 games are region-free too, so it'll be interesting to see the further fallout from this, but regardless, censorship kind of pisses us off,

852
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and so we dedicate the FUs of the week to all these people that just said FU to the Australian Censorship Board that are going to import their copies instead.

853
00:47:39,000 --> 00:48:02,000
My FU of the week is not really directed toward the person, but toward the situation.

854
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I got woke up, well, I had already woke up once and then passed right back out, but I was woke up from a dead sleep by someone calling me, saying that I left my keys in her car.

855
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And Rob, you know what I am when I'm just waking up. I'm incoherent.

856
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So, I have no idea what she's talking about. I still think I'm dreaming, okay?

857
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And I was like, but I need my keys.

858
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:34,000
She's like, I can't bring them to you, you're the one who left them, and just being really condescending and rude about it. I was like, wait, what the hell are you talking about?

859
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I was like, I need my house key too.

860
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
She's like, you don't have a copy? I was like, I don't know.

861
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,000
She's being really rude about it, but I was like, look, I just woke up, you don't need to be condescending and rude, okay?

862
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm not going to put up with that shit. I don't put up with it from anybody if I can help it.

863
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Um, also, um, FU to, um, I guess I don't really have much else in the way of FUs.

864
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Oh yeah, FU the stupid kids at the park.

865
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Cause we, um, my friend Sonia came over and we took pictures of the doffy that I finished for Kristen.

866
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And, um, one of mine.

867
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
These stupid kids are coming like, why are you taking pictures of dolls?

868
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm like, why does anybody take pictures of anything?

869
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I was like, don't be stupid.

870
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
So, that was it.

871
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Loki.

872
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
FU to this chair I'm sitting in.

873
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
That's it.

874
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:38,000
FU to Subway, who I suspect gave me food poisoning on my vacation that kept me in bed until 6pm yesterday,

875
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
meaning I missed out on two trips to the beach.

876
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That kind of pisses me off.

877
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I mean, I guess I should be thankful I got to go on the trip at all because the state of my pancreas was a little bit in question,

878
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
you know, with everything I've been going through recently.

879
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But still, food poisoning sucks.

880
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
At least I didn't have it for two weeks.

881
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
People shouldn't be sick on their vacations.

882
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
What kind of horrible punishment is that?

883
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
What did I do to you, Mother Nature?

884
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
What did I do to you?

885
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Alright, let's get back into the show.

886
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Get back into some more gaming news, eh, Jamie?

887
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I think that that's entirely doable, Rob.

888
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Oh, good.

889
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yes.

890
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So apparently Wii games look like crap, or most of them do.

891
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:28,000
According to the developer High Voltage, they're basically claiming that most of the end products for the Wii don't look as good as latter-day PS2 titles.

892
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And this is, of course, after they have said they're working on something called Conduit,

893
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:42,000
which is a first-person shooter boasting to be really advanced and supposed to actually be, I guess, the best one on the system.

894
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:51,000
They're quoted as saying that they think it's a real shame that publishers and developers aren't taking advantage of the technical possibilities of the Wii platform.

895
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Most Wii games don't even look as good as latter-day PS2 titles, and that's a real slap to the face of consumers.

896
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
So they're saying that they're wanting to raise a new bar.

897
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
But honestly, and how many times have I said this?

898
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It doesn't matter what the hell the game looks like, as long as it's fun.

899
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I don't know, their engine looked pretty nice.

900
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I mean, Katamari Damacy, let's face it, looks like crap, but a lot of people really enjoy the heck out of that game because it's fun.

901
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Good point.

902
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm sure the soccer moms of America who have been throwing themselves behind the Wii don't really care.

903
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Although I like to have both. I like to have a pretty game that's fun.

904
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Is that too much to ask? I don't think so.

905
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I don't think so.

906
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Well, they actually, High Voltage released a tech demo of their new engine, and it does look pretty good.

907
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Although the graphics still aren't that great.

908
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I mean, it's pretty impressive what they can do with the Wii, and it is a bit limited on hardware muscle.

909
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But still though, there's games out there you can make look pretty nice.

910
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Like Mario Galaxy looks pretty nice for it, and Brawl wasn't too bad.

911
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But yeah, I do see their point that some of the games are kind of lacking in polish, especially a lot of shovelware stuff out there.

912
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Well, what is it? The Wii is just two Gamecubes duct taped together or whatever?

913
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Well, it's not even that. It's just people are looking at the Wii as a cheap developing platform,

914
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and so they're putting no effort into releasing games for it.

915
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
They're just charging like 20 bucks for them, but they're garbage.

916
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So, that's the problem.

917
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
One game that's not quite garbage though is coming to Steam pretty soon here.

918
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Luminous. Actually, Q Entertainment and Valve have joined forces, and now Luminous will be available on the service.

919
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
It looks like a few different packs you can get.

920
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:53,000
The base pack for $9.95 will be available, as well as the advanced pack containing 21 new challenge mode skins,

921
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
60 puzzles for puzzle mode, and 35 stages for puzzle mode.

922
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,000
That'll come out for another $7.95, or you can grab the whole thing for $14.95.

923
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And that'll be made available Friday, April 25th.

924
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
If you didn't already have Luminous in one of the 5,000 other places it's available, there's your chance. Right?

925
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Yeah.

926
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Alright.

927
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Well, usually on this program we give out this thing called the Stupid Award,

928
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,000
and it usually goes out to some kid who shoots up his friends due to bad parenting, what turns out to be in the end.

929
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:34,000
But tonight we might have the example of an opposite, is that we have good parenting leaving the smackdown on a bad kid.

930
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
So we might actually have an opposite.

931
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
This is one of those feel-good stories, you know, when we always have all this bad news about stupid kids.

932
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
We might have some good news here.

933
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
This has to do with the mother of one teenager.

934
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:55,000
What happened is that this kid was supposed to be doing some chores, but he decided to break the vacuum cleaner so that he didn't have to do any work.

935
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,000
So what happened is that the mom went on to Craigslist, and this posting was found on Richmond's Craigslist, and it says this.

936
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
My son seems to think everything should be handed to him on a silver platter, so the Xbox is going bye-bye.

937
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I do have an assortment of games as well that I will sell for $15 each.

938
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Prices firm, must replace vacuum that he broke, thinking it would get him out of having to do chores.

939
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:27,000
By the way, the mother has also informed the world that she's busted him for looking at porn sites.

940
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:39,000
The internet access is now locked behind a password, and mom apparently went onto his MySpace and put a picture of Snoopy on the MySpace.

941
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:48,000
This is a mom that is taking no crap from her kid and violating his privacy in every sense of the word.

942
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But what is the old saying? As long as you live under our house, I will log onto your MySpace and put up pictures of Snoopy.

943
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, like GS68 in chat says, it could have been worse. It could have been Hello Kitty.

944
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But I think Snoopy means she's snooping. I think there was a pun there.

945
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:19,000
But good job for her bringing the smackdown. You're right, sometimes kids are brats. I don't know, selling the Xbox off might be a bit extreme.

946
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
But I don't know, if this kid has repetitive issues, then maybe it's what has to be done.

947
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I mean, I'm not going to tell you how to raise your kid in that sense. You know what's best.

948
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
But that does seem a little extreme. This must have been one bad fucking kid for that to happen.

949
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I think so. Although, see, I can't really say much because I was a real brat when I was a kid.

950
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I think we all were at one point in our lives.

951
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
My mom took away my Nintendo one time. This is my brand new Nintendo that my daddy bought me.

952
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So I was like, I went back in her room and got it and hooked it back up by myself.

953
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And she's like, I took that away from you. I was like, my daddy gave that to me. And if you take it, it's theft.

954
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I love all the pictures that they have and like these responses and stuff that the vacuum cleaner says do not want.

955
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Lovely.

956
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
That's great. No, I was a bad kid. I was a bad kid.

957
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I was naughty when I was like three or four. I was always the bad kid that had to go time out in class.

958
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And then I turned into a perfect little angel. And that's how I am today. Right? Right?

959
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
You got your halo hung up by horns.

960
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah, whatever. Back to gaming news.

961
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah, I was going to say we got we got other games to talk about, too.

962
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
But kudos for that mom for having balls anyway.

963
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Our buddies at Namco Bandai have brought us some shooting stuff.

964
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So they have really in the summer.

965
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
There is Power Up Forever, an Xbox Live arcade and PlayStation Network,

966
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:55,000
which is a top down shooter where as you shoot things, you absorb their energy and you grow.

967
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:04,000
So you. I'm not going to compare this with Katamari as the article compares it with Katamari.

968
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:11,000
However, I see it as more of expanding your universe, you know, a perspective type thing.

969
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:18,000
The bigger you get, the more you can see, you know, because it's supposed to as you get more power ups,

970
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
you're supposed to see larger and larger enemies that were always there.

971
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But you just couldn't see them before because you were needle.

972
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But it's supposed to be like an infinitely going game, I guess.

973
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
It just goes on and on, my friend. This is the game that never ends.

974
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It just goes on and on, my friend.

975
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I hate my laptop, actually.

976
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I was just thinking, you know, we don't have enough space shooters on Xbox Live arcade or PlayStation three.

977
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So I was really hoping we would get some more. Don't worry, Rob.

978
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
They will never. Weren't you just thinking that, too? Like, I'm like, God, what is it we're missing on Xbox Live music?

979
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
No, we have Boom Boom Rocket. That's all we need. What are we missing? Adventure games?

980
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Oh, no, we have the Arcadian Quest. Oh, space shooters. We don't have any of those.

981
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
That's what we need.

982
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
But wasn't there galaxy wars? Geometry wars?

983
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I was being facetious.

984
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I know, and I was going, boom.

985
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Hey, Rob. What?

986
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:37,000
One thing that we don't have enough or I'm sure we're not going to have enough pretty soon of is games that are going to use the brand new balance board that's coming with Wii Fit.

987
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Well, fear not, because Take-Two has decided, hey, guess what?

988
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Don King's Prize Fighter? That's right, bitches. It's going to have balance board training games.

989
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Oh, boy.

990
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Because when you're done playing Wii Fit, you can get Wii Fit again with, you know, training games and the...

991
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I don't know. It's a boxing game that has a bunch of actually kind of almost rhythm games to it to train in, but now you can use the Wii Fit balance board as well.

992
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Because when I think Don King, I think Wii Fit DDR-ish type thing.

993
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Well, it's a boxing game, okay? I know. Maybe they'll have like...

994
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Well, that might actually be kind of fun. A game that combines Wii boxing with the Wii Fit board for balance. That actually could be kind of cool.

995
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Except this is the training portion. I don't think it's going to actually have, you know...

996
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But here's the thing that I think would be pretty funny. They could use like a balance board mini game or something like that where you have to stay balanced on Don King's hair.

997
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
That might be challenging.

998
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,000
That would definitely be challenging. Another game that a lot of folks are looking forward to, no really, would be Quake Live.

999
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:58,000
You might remember Quake Live was once known as Quake Zero. It's basically Quake 3 but on the web.

1000
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Hey, guess what? You can now sign up for the beta program if you head on over to QuakeLive.com.

1001
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Basically all you're doing is you're giving them your email address, probably no doubt so they can spam you and all that stuff.

1002
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But hey, it's Quake 3 and it's on the web and it's going to be free.

1003
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Quake 3 was my favorite in the series.

1004
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Not to knock betas or anything. I love signing up for betas. For some reason I don't play them once I sign up for them.

1005
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I guess I'm not really their prime beta candidate.

1006
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I really wish there was betas for things other than, I don't know, first person shooters might be nice.

1007
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I know that they do have the occasional beta for an MMO game, but I don't play MMOs anymore.

1008
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
But something else would be nice.

1009
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I get it. Usually the thing is, what are they trying to beta test? They're trying to stress test their servers.

1010
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I would stress test, I don't know, Animal Crossing. I'd be down with that.

1011
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Or a racing game.

1012
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I somehow doubt it because Nintendo is kind of their own little box.

1013
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
They don't really care about the quality they're on anyways, so that's fine.

1014
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I don't know, maybe like a racing game or something. That might be pretty cool.

1015
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
But don't expect it to work perfectly because it is a beta.

1016
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Oh well.

1017
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
So, I don't know. You can check that out again.

1018
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Quakelive.com if you want to sign up for the Quake Live beta. I just might because I do love Quake 3 that much.

1019
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It's one of my, the only FPSs I really played a whole lot of that I just enjoyed very much.

1020
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Well, for any of our listeners in Japan, because this is probably only coming out there,

1021
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Squeenix has a new RPG for the mobile phones and it's called ELLARK.

1022
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It's a free online RPG though.

1023
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And it will be launched in June for the three major Japanese characters.

1024
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:07,000
But it's, this style looks sort of Final Fantasy, the little bit of artwork I'm seeing is sort of Final Fantasy tactics-tastic.

1025
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So maybe.

1026
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Well it is free.

1027
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Free if you live somewhere else than here.

1028
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Because our cell phones suck.

1029
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
They only barely do TV.

1030
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Even Europe is kicking our butt in cell phones.

1031
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Well, here's one thing we aren't going to be free of anytime soon and that is new Spider-Man games.

1032
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Oh joy.

1033
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Hurrah!

1034
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Still trying to recapture their triumph of, was it, the PlayStation version of Spider-Man 2.

1035
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Probably one of the greatest Spider-Man games that they've made so far.

1036
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man Friend or Foe weren't very good.

1037
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But Web of Shadows, the brand new game that was confirmed after being sort of leaked out, hopes to change all that.

1038
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And it's going to be a free roaming open-ended adventure that's going to be headed to, I guess, all of the current consoles out there and handhelds.

1039
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And is being brought to you by Shaba Games and Treyarch.

1040
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And I didn't really say what the game's going to revolve around but there's a lot of Venom looking stuff.

1041
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And they also said there's possibly other Marvel Universe characters that you'll actually get to play as as well.

1042
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
They hinted to that stuff.

1043
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So, I don't know.

1044
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Neat, I guess.

1045
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
But just the last, I remember when Spider-Man games used to be good.

1046
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You don't trust the track record of Spider-Man games.

1047
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
The last few games have really sucked.

1048
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Especially, I mean, Spider-Man 3 where you'd sink into the grass like quicksand.

1049
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
That's funny.

1050
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
ssj100matt kind of agrees with you.

1051
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
He says, I'm a sucker for free roam New York City games.

1052
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I'm really hoping this game doesn't suck.

1053
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
We shall see.

1054
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Hey, our Skype line is just about open.

1055
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
We only have a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the Skype line before we get onto our program.

1056
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
1877 Game OLR is the phone number or our username on Skype.

1057
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Get ready, Orange Lounge Radio.

1058
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
But first, we have to do a quick follow-up.

1059
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Remember last week we talked about that Famitsu was reporting or was saying that a new DS is very likely to be announced at the next E3.

1060
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Well, Nintendo came right out and denied it.

1061
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:36,000
They denied it and said, no, we are not making a new DS and we're not really revealing anything that we're going to be revealing at E3 until E3.

1062
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:51,000
It should be noted, however, that a couple years ago, one day before it was announced, Nintendo denied having any knowledge about a DS Lite and then a day later the DS Lite was announced.

1063
01:04:51,000 --> 01:05:05,000
So, you know, you can always take Nintendo denials with a grain of salt, but at the same time, the original news has a bit of a grain of salt as well because it's probably based simply off the fact that, gee, Nintendo likes to redo their consoles all the time.

1064
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Also, was it the publisher of Famitsu was the one originally quoting that that was going to be announced at E3 and then they retracted that statement too, which is interesting.

1065
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I don't know. Just wait for E3, what, a few months away? Seriously.

1066
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:30,000
All right. One more story, then the Skype line is open. Dark Sakura, our final official story for the evening.

1067
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Um, well, there is going to be some good news for Mass Effect PC players and that is the, um, actually, uh, free content. Free content is nice, isn't it?

1068
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Yay, free!

1069
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Um, but that's the, um, Bring Down the Sky is going to be free for anyone who's interested in it.

1070
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Is it bad that I didn't even realize Mass Effect was on PC? Like, I thought it was an Xbox 360 only game for some reason. I'm just, I'm just out of it, I guess.

1071
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Well, they had to pay for it on Xbox Live for five bucks.

1072
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah, but that's kind of cool that they gave it for free on PC. Maybe they just couldn't think of a way to charge for it.

1073
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
It's in pieces of their soul.

1074
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Who knows. All right, well, it's also free for you to call in and interact with us on our Skype line 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1075
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And once you know it, we're already getting hammered with phone calls, so let's open up the lines.

1076
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

1077
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma from New York.

1078
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Ranma from New York. Do you like the free roaming New York City games as well? Like, SSJ100Matt?

1079
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I just heard about it myself.

1080
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:47,000
What about, like, Grand Theft Auto and all these types of other games that are parodying New York? Do you like seeing parodies of your home city?

1081
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Sure, I'm all for it.

1082
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
All right, all for it. All right, what did you call in and talk to us about tonight?

1083
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Well, before I begin, Jamie, happy birthday.

1084
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Thank you.

1085
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:04,000
You're welcome. I want to give you a brief talk about New York Comic Con. First thing, there was no John Woo talking about the Metroid Prime movie.

1086
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Yeah, we kind of all figured that was bullshit last week, but we had to report it. It was everywhere, so...

1087
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Yeah, because when I got there Friday or Saturday, I was with my cult panelists and we were like, let's see if we can find anything, but nothing as ever came up.

1088
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Dude, if they were going to have something, you wouldn't have had to look very hard. It would have been in neon lights.

1089
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
True, true. And the big thing they were really pushing was the Iron Man movie.

1090
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Not too surprising.

1091
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yeah, pretty much.

1092
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Maybe next year.

1093
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Yeah, it'll be pretty awesome, though. But overall, the con itself was fun. At least it was on the higher level of the Javits Center, where it was actually spread out. We could actually walk around and breathe.

1094
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Nice.

1095
01:07:50,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Yeah, there was a lot of people there, a lot of web comic artists that were there, and you know, Jamie, I did send you a picture, so...

1096
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I like the picture.

1097
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Yeah, and remember I told you yesterday I had another surprise for you?

1098
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yes, you called when I was at a place buying the comics cheap.

1099
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Check your PM box. That's my birthday gift to you.

1100
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Okay...

1101
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Would you slowly describe this for our listeners as she opens it up?

1102
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Well, if you're a fan of a certain webcomic called VGCats, I spoke to Scott and asked him to do a nice little drawing of our very own Jamie.

1103
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Oh...

1104
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
So you actually got the guy who draws VGCats to draw a picture of Jamie.

1105
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
That's cute!

1106
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yeah, he showed it to me before the show.

1107
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Oh my god, that's so cute!

1108
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
So, very cool.

1109
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Yay! Thank you!

1110
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Why couldn't you get the rest of us, huh? No, I'm just kidding. No, I think that's great.

1111
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
VGCats is like my favorite webcomic right now.

1112
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
No, you know what's funny? He actually calls how she says right now, but it might change.

1113
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
It's been for a while.

1114
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Depending on what bribes other webcomics send her.

1115
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:06,000
He called me, I guess, like Friday, I think he called me, because he wanted me to send a picture of you to have this model.

1116
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
But the problem was, because I was in Mendocino, I had no cell phone access, I didn't get the message till today.

1117
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
But you must have gotten on MySpace or something, you found a picture somehow.

1118
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
He's got the picture from us at E3.

1119
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Yeah, I noticed. That's awesome.

1120
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Well, it wasn't me that got the picture. You can ask. You can thank Gio of Dia. She picked out the picture for me to take over there.

1121
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Nice. Well, there you have it.

1122
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
So that's the guy who does VGCats, Drew Jamie. That's awesome.

1123
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yay!

1124
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Pretty cool.

1125
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Oh, that's so cool. I'm going to have to write a thank you, too.

1126
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
But thank you so much. I appreciate that. That's like the best thing ever.

1127
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Well, we should just invite him on the damn show.

1128
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I'd like to. They were our website of the week once.

1129
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
We'll work on that. We'll work it out.

1130
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
That's so cute.

1131
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Well, Rama, thank you so much. That was very nice of you to do.

1132
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And the whole chat room is fawning over it right now, so there you go.

1133
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
You notice how it just looks like Jamie if you think about it. Just her normal attitude, per se.

1134
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Yeah, it's cool. Except now I'm going to make her wear cat ears just to compare.

1135
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I have several cat eared hats. Thank you, Rob.

1136
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
All right. Anything else you want to share with our chatters today, Rama, and our listeners?

1137
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Well, that's pretty much it. I just wanted to get that across. That was it.

1138
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Well, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

1139
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Sure. No problem. Anytime.

1140
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,000
You make Jamie's birthday last all weekend long. I'm sure she can't complain.

1141
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Yes. Oh, and Jamie?

1142
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Uh-huh.

1143
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
She wants to know, where did you get the gelato from? The Guinness Gelato?

1144
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Naya.

1145
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Okay.

1146
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I've only seen Naya in California, so I don't know if it's all over the place, but they have different flavors that circulate.

1147
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:55,000
They also had champagne gelato. They also had mojito and Captain Morgan gelato.

1148
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I like that one.

1149
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:03,000
But the Guinness Gelato is freaking good. And they usually have Nutella.

1150
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
But if ever you find a Naya and they have whole wheat gelato, try it. It tastes like cereal.

1151
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Definitely.

1152
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Amanda in chat says they're Bay Area. I think they only have six stores. And if that's the Amanda I'm thinking it is, then hi.

1153
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
There you go. They're Bay Area only.

1154
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Yeah. They're really good, though.

1155
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It's not Pinkberry. I'm sorry.

1156
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
All right.

1157
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
We just got...

1158
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
We're going to let you go, Rama. Take care.

1159
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I'll try.

1160
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Bye.

1161
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I'll catch up to you guys later.

1162
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
1877 game. Oh, dang. I just hung up and, boop, here comes another call.

1163
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1164
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
GS68.

1165
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

1166
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
First of all, I'm happy 4.28 to everyone who celebrates it.

1167
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Happy 4.20, dude.

1168
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Where's our Zaku call? You know we need a Zaku call on 4.20.

1169
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
He's celebrating.

1170
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
All right. What's up, GS68?

1171
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Anyways, this week was the one year anniversary of the V Team Massacre, and I just want to say one thing to everyone who immediately pinned the blame on video games, especially people who didn't even have any resources or citations for that.

1172
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Such as Lord Voldemort?

1173
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Yes. I mean, why did he go up to the killers, the family, and say all that to their faces?

1174
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I dare you. I dare you to go up to his parents, his siblings, if he has any, their faces, and start talking about how his son was influenced by video games and all that.

1175
01:12:42,000 --> 01:13:01,000
At the same time, though, I think this whole week of memory and everything is sort of to just kind of, you know, I think we have to kind of let those bitter feelings just kind of go right now and try to look back and just kind of remember those that lost their lives and what was just a senseless and horrible thing and tragedy.

1176
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:09,000
So at the same time, it's kind of like, let's just not draw the pain out any longer, you know what I mean?

1177
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:20,000
But, you know, I understand. It was kind of stupid for some of those people to be blaming video games in the first place, and it's just kind of sad that it keeps going on throughout all these tragic events that happened.

1178
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
And the call dropped. We lost them. Was that bandwidth? Is the network still going?

1179
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I'm still on.

1180
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:40,000
All right. Well, we lost them. But, yeah, and of course, you know what's interesting? I have a friend that's actually going to be going to Virginia Tech next year, so, you know, I'm just, I know this is probably a difficult time.

1181
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I know we have listeners out there, too, so I know it was probably a difficult week, and, you know, our thoughts are with you guys.

1182
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
And definitely, let's just try and get past it.

1183
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1184
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:02,000
While we wait for some calls to drop in, do we have any quick last minute stories, by chance? Anything last minute?

1185
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Yes.

1186
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
All right. What would you like to share?

1187
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I'm just going to suggest, or, Blitz League was one of the games that they announced at Midway's Gamers' Day that's getting a sequel, same as Game Party, apparently both of those games getting sequels.

1188
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Game Party?

1189
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Game Party. That was the one that had beer pong in it, but they called it something else, Pinkup.

1190
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
That's what they were calling it instead of beer pong.

1191
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Right. Oh, we got another call. Let's go take it real quick. I'm curious to know more about this, though. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1192
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Hello, this is RossDioUT.

1193
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Hello, RossDioUT. What is on your mind?

1194
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:51,000
A little bit. Before I go into that, I would like to thank DMN for being an asshole and a grief friend banning me from the chat. That leaves me with time to play games while I'm listening. Very nice.

1195
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I'm not even going to go there. I don't know what the heck's going on. Sometimes I feel not in control of our own chat room, but we'll try to get that sorted out. What else is on your mind, though, buddy?

1196
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I don't know if you saw this, but recently the Vendee had a really creative promotion for their upcoming Ghostbusters game. They actually restored the old Ectomobile, you know, the car from the movie, and they parked it at a Best Buy in Minnesota for promotional purposes.

1197
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:38,000
They actually have a picture on Kotaku I'd link to the chat, but, you know. They did a bang-up job on it. It's very nice.

1198
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I didn't see the car, but I saw the box art for the game, which I found to be half-appropriate and half-boring. Did you see the box art that was posted?

1199
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I think this is temporary.

1200
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It is just one of those placeholder things for people who want to pre-order the game.

1201
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
It's a ways off before the game comes out.

1202
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I would have just expected to see some more brouhaha about, because isn't the script actually by Bill Murray and them? The script for the game is by the people who did the movie. I'm sorry, not Bill Murray, but Harold Ramis and the people who did the original.

1203
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I would expect more fanfare over that.

1204
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Well, like you said, I think they want to keep to the feel of the original. I remember the original VHS covers had just the logo, which, you know, kind of fits since that's what it's about.

1205
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
That was 20 years ago.

1206
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I'm sorry?

1207
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
That was 20 years ago. Things were different back then, you know what I mean?

1208
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Well, there is something to be said about nostalgia, you know?

1209
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I guess that's true.

1210
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I'll give you that, but that huge old Xbox 360 banner in white kind of ruins it, you know what I mean?

1211
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And same thing with the PlayStation. Well, at least the PlayStation 3 thing is black, but you know what I mean?

1212
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Those mandatory banners they have to have on there kind of ruin that all black box, you know what I mean?

1213
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Yeah.

1214
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I think that's honestly what it is for me, is that, you know, having those other little streaks in it ruined the thing.

1215
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
But anyway, it's just box art. I'll get over it.

1216
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
If the game's good, it can be fantastic.

1217
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I don't know about you, I throw the boxes away because I have like hundreds of games and I really don't have the space for all those big ass boxes.

1218
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
You know, I just put them in jewel cases myself. I don't know what you guys do.

1219
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I do leave them in the case, but the cases are all on a shelf. They're on a DVD rack type thing that's pretty big.

1220
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,000
So like I have my Wii games on one rack, Xbox 360 on another rack, so it works.

1221
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I don't own as many games as one might think.

1222
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I certainly don't own as many games as Jamie does, who has to have an entire like wall in her house with nothing but bookshelves that have the games.

1223
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I will tell you what we do, is that for the systems that we have out most often, being our Xbox 360, the Wii and the PS3, and the Saturn is out right now too, I think.

1224
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,000
What we do is we usually keep out the games that we're playing the most and we have a small rack that stays in the front room.

1225
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:02,000
We've got actually these large bookshelves in the computer room that's basically also in my room, because I'm on the computer in there.

1226
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
But we keep them with our movies, with our DVDs.

1227
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And the special edition boxes, we will every so often have them on display for the newer ones, but right now they're all in the vault.

1228
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
They don't make gaming organizers quite like they used to either.

1229
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I had a pretty badass one for the Atari 2600 that was like a little drawer and you'd hit the button and the drawer would pop out.

1230
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And then you'd hit another button and the game would kind of pop out.

1231
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I mean, it was just cheap plastic with levers, but the way it worked was pretty awesome.

1232
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I don't know.

1233
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I liked the...

1234
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1235
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Well, the Atari 5200 had its little storage compartment in the back for controllers in a couple of games, built into the system.

1236
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Yeah, Nintendo actually had something similar to that for the Super Nintendo for the N64.

1237
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
They had like these game houses. I have a couple of them. They're very nice.

1238
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I remember that for the Super Nintendo.

1239
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
That's true.

1240
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And then what do we get? We get a Wii thing that was supposed to have a chip holder in it that ends up getting cancelled.

1241
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I know.

1242
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Anyway, sorry. I derailed your original topic of the Ghostbusters thing. Is there anything else you wanted to say on that or anything else you wanted to talk about tonight?

1243
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I don't know. That was just about it, except that people asked her if that's about it. It would take too much to bring up something else.

1244
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'll do that in an email next week.

1245
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Anyways, it was good to talk to you guys.

1246
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
It's always best to take the high road, Ross Steel.

1247
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
All right, have a good one, buddy.

1248
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Have a good one, bro.

1249
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Take care.

1250
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:40,000
1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Oh, we've got to take at least one more call.

1251
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

1252
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Legend of Zaku.

1253
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Happy 420, Legend of Zaku.

1254
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I don't smoke weed for the record. I just say this to all the people that celebrate the consumption of cannabis.

1255
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I've got to give you a hard time, Zaku, because you've got to admit it.

1256
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I don't know if it's just your microphone or the environment you call us in if you're calling us from a tin can or something.

1257
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Tin can? Where's the string, though?

1258
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,000
You always sound a little bit high, but that's all right. We're equal opportunity entertainers here at OrangeLoungeRadio.

1259
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
To what do we owe this great phone call tonight?

1260
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Let me see. Basically, it's like this. Recently, last Friday, I went out with this girl, and we happened to stop by Dave & Buster's on our date.

1261
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I was just wondering. I know I don't want to dig up DDR as much, but suppose the date of yours basically never played DDR, and if she did, it was really horrible.

1262
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:50,000
What songs would you even recommend in order for both of us to play?

1263
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I would say fuck it and take her over to Jumpin' Jackpot, because that's where you're really going to get some pussy is Jumpin' Jackpot.

1264
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Oh, wow.

1265
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Would you agree, DarkSakura?

1266
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
What turns you on more, DDR or Jumpin' Jackpot?

1267
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
DDR.

1268
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:17,000
All right. You know what? Here's the thing. If the girl doesn't like DDR, is it that she doesn't like DDR or that she's just not good at it, so it kind of turns her off?

1269
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:28,000
She's not good. She dislikes it for the fact that she can't really use both of her legs effectively.

1270
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Two guaranteed ways to get somebody who's not into DDR, girl, boy, or not, two guaranteed ways to get them into it is that A, you pick easy songs, one-foot songs.

1271
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I did. I had her on Beginners.

1272
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:49,000
All right. Good. Good. That's where you got to start. And then the other one would be to pick recognizable songs. You got to pick the Britney Spears song.

1273
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:57,000
It kind of depends on what kind of music she's into, but you got to realize your date's not going to recognize Smile DK. They're not going to know.

1274
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
It was on a Supernova 2. All right. I get your point there.

1275
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Yeah. You got to pick something recognizable, but after you get past the recognizable song, then you can pick something catchy because I don't know about the rest of you guys, but one thing I remember about my very first game of DDR I ever played on a DDR 1.5 mix, that song Butterfly was damn catchy, and that song was in my head for three days after playing DDR.

1276
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I was just kind of going around going, I'm your little butterfly, and I could not get that freaking song out of my head. So it's okay to pick catchy stuff.

1277
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:41,000
But you got to kind of know, if she's kind of a rocker girl, Smile DK is not going to be your thing, and I don't know if DDR necessarily will be.

1278
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Remember, as I said, I was totally unprepared for the situation.

1279
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You just let her pick the song.

1280
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Well, that's the thing. She said she didn't care.

1281
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Typical woman response.

1282
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I don't care, but I will criticize you when you choose the wrong thing.

1283
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
As an official woman, I can...

1284
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Oh, official. Yes, she has the woman seal of approval on her buttocks.

1285
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
No, I have it on my chest. Thank you.

1286
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:28,000
If a girl tells you, I don't care, it either means that no, she really doesn't care, but once she hears it, she's probably not going to like it. So I would just say, pick one, pick the other, and ask her which one sounds better.

1287
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Don't leave it open.

1288
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Yeah, I kind of, as I said, I kind of needed that advice, you know, the quick spur of the moment thing.

1289
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Hopefully I'll try it again if I, you know, once I go out with her again.

1290
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:53,000
My buddy Amanda in chat says, reminds me, and she's an official woman too, she says, the way Rob got me to play it was, quote, Amanda, it's like a rave, but a game, because she was a big raver back then.

1291
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And I was like, it's like a rave, but a game, because there's flashing lights.

1292
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
It's like cross stitching, but a game.

1293
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Well, Zaku, best of luck to you on future dates, and we hope you get some, alright? Good luck.

1294
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Yeah.

1295
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Take care, buddy.

1296
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Did you hear that? Yeah, it was kind of like, yeah, me too.

1297
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:22,000
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. If you missed us tonight, sorry, maybe you can leave us a voicemail on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1298
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Don't forget about our contest going on too, you're going to check that out as we are going on throughout the week and looking for contest entries.

1299
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
So, more last minute stories from Loki. We had the story about Blitz, the League, and Beer Pong getting a sequel.

1300
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
It's not Beer Pong, it's a game called-

1301
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
But that's the part we care about.

1302
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Game Party, and it had Beer Pong in it, and Shuffleboard and some other shit.

1303
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It was a cheap ass game. One of those maybe shovelware games or whatever.

1304
01:24:49,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Anyways, real quick, the Burnout Paradise Cagney update that was going to be coming out, actually from what I read now, it's out now.

1305
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:07,000
So if you pop in your copy of Burnout, you'll get your new portions of the map, which I will have to try when I get home.

1306
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:16,000
And it's also going to include three more online modes, Road Rage, Markman, and Stunt Run are going to be available online as well now.

1307
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,000
For PS3 owners, you will also be getting the option for custom soundtracks.

1308
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
So that's pretty nice.

1309
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Something kind of disappointing, that game Boom Blocks that was supposedly going to have that head tracking kind of easter egg.

1310
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Well, they removed head tracking, so no reason to buy that game now.

1311
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:45,000
But at the same time, you can't yell, get out of my head, to this video game anymore, I guess.

1312
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Let's see here, apparently an Xbox 360 power supply was blamed for a fire. That's kind of funny.

1313
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Xbox Live is going to be down tomorrow.

1314
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Not if it's your house that burned down, that's not funny.

1315
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
But it wasn't, so it's funny.

1316
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Xbox Live is going to be down tomorrow from two, or I guess tonight, two in the morning to ten tomorrow Pacific time, just for some spring cleaning maintenance.

1317
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Let's see here, also there's some interesting things.

1318
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You might know this guy, Ricky Gervais, he's the guy that's in the office in the UK.

1319
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:39,000
He's actually going to be kind of having a cameo in Grand Theft Auto IV as part of the city's stand-up comedy club.

1320
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
This is a three-minute act that will, I guess, loop or whatever.

1321
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
They'll have different people going on stage, but I think that's kind of cool that they have real comedians doing acts in the game.

1322
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
So, a little bit of immersion there.

1323
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Interesting.

1324
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Let's see here, also, apparently Halo Wars is coming along pretty well.

1325
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:12,000
There's been a few people that are part of the Xbox 360 launch team that have been caught playing Halo Wars Alpha online.

1326
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Saw you, caught you.

1327
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So that's interesting.

1328
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Then, let's see here.

1329
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Apparently, I think you may have talked about this before, virtual console games.

1330
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
People have found ways to pirate those now.

1331
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
That's kind of interesting.

1332
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:42,000
They found ways to strip away, I guess, all of the encryption on them, and now a team called Blaze is releasing them out on the internet right now.

1333
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:53,000
They have a few of them, and using a tool put out by yet someone else, you can actually install them to your system using the Twilight Princess hack.

1334
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,000
So that's, I guess, no one's perfect as far as security goes.

1335
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:09,000
What's interesting, though, also is that the UK version of the internet channel has also been leaked out using that method as well.

1336
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
So that means that WiiWare isn't immune to it either.

1337
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Uh oh.

1338
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Uh oh.

1339
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But if Nintendo catches you, you will get the wrath upon you.

1340
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Yes.

1341
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Apparently, there's no plans for Gears of War 2.

1342
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I just want to say, that's the problem with posting these methods on the internet is that Nintendo will patch it.

1343
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Yeah.

1344
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Apparently, there's not going to be a Gears of War 2 demo.

1345
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
However, there have been some hints.

1346
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Mark Raine, I guess, dropping some hints that Unreal Tournament 3 will feature the first Gears of War 2 content tease.

1347
01:28:49,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And didn't say what it is, but he says, we know some of these great mods are going to be, or they're talking about the mods, those are also going to be available for the Xbox 360 version of Unreal Tournament 3.

1348
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:08,000
But people are thinking maybe that they're going to have either a demo on Unreal Tournament 3, or there's just going to be some new video footage of the game.

1349
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
So I guess that's pretty cool.

1350
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And let's see here.

1351
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I think that's pretty much it.

1352
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Oh, there's been a lot of homebrew stuff made for the Wii as well, including now they have SNES emulators with classic controller support.

1353
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Genesis Sega CD emulators, Master System Game Gear emulators for the Wii, PC Engine emulators.

1354
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:48,000
They have the Rin Game Boy channel for the Wii, Emuloader, which will do some other emulators, and Wii Paint, which might be fun.

1355
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
They need a Mario Paint for the Wii. That'd be fun.

1356
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
But that's it.

1357
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Wowies, lots of last minute news.

1358
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I thought, I was thinking going into this week after I'd been gone, I was like, oh, it's a slow gaming week, but no, lots of news.

1359
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Lots of good stuff.

1360
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:06,000
All right, well that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio, but not before we get everybody's final thoughts.

1361
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
DarkSakura, your final thought.

1362
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I should have ordered this earlier.

1363
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
What is it?

1364
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Tickets for Phantom of the Opera.

1365
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Oh, nice.

1366
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I want to go.

1367
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
It sounds like fun.

1368
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Loki, if I go, I have to take my mother.

1369
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
This is going to sound so gay, but I don't care.

1370
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Going to a musical theater is something I have to do with my mom, because she's such a fan.

1371
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
When Mama Mia comes to town, she's like, we got to go.

1372
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Loki, your final thought. I will not be seeing Phantom this year since I've seen it the last two times it's been in town, and I really don't need to see it a third time.

1373
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
My final thought is Sweeney Todd is going to be in town this year, and that's one I want to see.

1374
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
So that's probably the one I'll buy my mom tickets for.

1375
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
That might be cool.

1376
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Because if I'm going to go to musical theater, I'm going to take her to a violent play and see what she thinks of that.

1377
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Awesome.

1378
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I like your mom, and we need to call her on the show.

1379
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Mother's Day is just around the corner.

1380
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Rob, we need to figure out what we're going to do for our Justin TV deal.

1381
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I know. There is a Justin TV special thingy in the works.

1382
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
More OLR programming coming.

1383
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Yes.

1384
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
We'll talk about it this week.

1385
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I like asking questions like that, because it teases it and makes the chat room go, WTF, must listen, or watch, or stuff.

1386
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
There you go. More to come on that soon.

1387
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:27,000
But in the meantime, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting us or listening to us live as it may be on AllGames.com.

1388
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
We really appreciate it.

1389
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Join us again on Sunday nights.

1390
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Remember, if you like what you hear, we do this show for free.

1391
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Please tell two friends about our show.

1392
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
It's a way to help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

1393
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
And send cash.

1394
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
No, we don't ask for your cash.

1395
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
But we do ask for five-star iTunes reviews.

1396
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
But I personally ask for their cash.

1397
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
You don't always get it, though.

1398
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Just like Loki's not going to get that Xbox 360.

1399
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I got sent.

1400
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I've got $3 exactly for listeners.

1401
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I forgot to mention this as part of the last minute story.

1402
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I did have a listener buy me dinner.

1403
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
So I guess that was kind of cool.

1404
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I was sent a dollar by a listener in Boston.

1405
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
And then I got sent a $2 bill.

1406
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And a bunch of Doctor Who fanzines.

1407
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Real quick, I thought that I'd add this in there because I forgot to mention this during last minute stories.

1408
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
What's that?

1409
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Apparently, Peekaboo, a company that specializes in a temporary at-home stripper pole, is working on...

1410
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Oh, no.

1411
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Yes, yes, including one that's endorsed by Karma Electra, is announced this week that they are developing a strip aerobic scheme for the Wii.

1412
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:34,000
So Peekaboo is pleased to confirm that it's in talks to develop a game for the Wii that meets mainstream demand for fun and fitness benefits of pole dancing.

1413
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
The company said in an email...

1414
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
This has to be a joke.

1415
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
No.

1416
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
This has to be a joke.

1417
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Peekaboo and its partners are focused on using Wii-friendly hardware to make aerobic pole dancing instantly accessible, just as Guitar Hero did for Rock and Roll.

1418
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Actually, actually, I have to say that there are some fitness places that offer pole dancing as an exercise.

1419
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I know you think this is a joke, but this is on ABC News.

1420
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,000
No, I fully believe it because I've seen advertisements for pole dancing classes.

1421
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
That's awesome.

1422
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
What can I say?

1423
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
It's just more of the randomness you've come to expect and love from Orange Lounge Radio.

1424
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
And we'll do it all again next week, same time, same place.

1425
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki.

1426
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
We're Orange Lounge Radio.

1427
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Good night!

1428
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1429
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,000

01:33:49,000 --> 01:34:09,000
See you next week!
