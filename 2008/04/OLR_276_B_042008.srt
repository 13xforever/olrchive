00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:19,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:21,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:29,315
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live on this Sunday evening, April 20th, 2008, with episode number 276 of our show.

6
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,317
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live on allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 p.m.

7
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:35,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Pacific, immediately following the Bobby Blackwolf show.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,962
[SPEAKER_08]: So come join us for live taping if you've never been here before.

9
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:42,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I do know we have some new faces in our chat, so thanks so much to all the guys in chat.

10
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:47,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I think as we are making our presence more known on allgames.com and people are realizing...

11
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:47,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

12
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:08,965
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

13
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:36,697
[SPEAKER_07]: There's kind of a wonder what the hell is the download content going to be?

14
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:50,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, according to CVG's recent Grand Theft Auto 4 Collector's Edition magazine, the Xbox 360 download content could be whole new cities.

15
00:01:51,243 --> 00:02:10,131
[SPEAKER_07]: They were saying, of course, to call games as vastly ambitious as Vice City and San Andreas mere expansion packs seems childish, but nevertheless, the downloadable content DLC coming from the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto 4 has repositioned those games in just this way.

16
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:15,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Downloadable content so far has meant the odd new car, jumper of a bit...

17
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:41,435
[SPEAKER_07]: But Grand Theft Auto 4 is set to completely redefine the idea of expansions with Grand Theft Auto 4 What Vice City or San Andreas were to Grand Theft Auto 3 Yes, Rockstar is clearly hinting at new downloadable cities And chances of them being London, Vice City, or San Andreas are slim to none So that's new as brand new

18
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:45,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto 4's Liberty City is just the beginning.

19
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:47,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about that and get excited.

20
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:53,404
[SPEAKER_08]: So, since this new Grand Theft Auto game is supposed to be a parody of New York City, right?

21
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:55,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to get Upstate New York as the expansions?

22
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:57,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, you know?

23
00:02:57,306 --> 00:02:58,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Jersey?

24
00:02:58,827 --> 00:02:59,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Jersey?

25
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:05,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're going to just replace, say, Vice City or something like that with downloadable content.

26
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:07,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto Poughkeepsie?

27
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:29,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we could see additions to the game because obviously they can only fit so much on that disc so if I could see expansions to the current city like you know outskirts type stuff but I don't know about like you know Grand Theft Auto London like you'd be able to fly to another city or something like that from the airport but that'd be pretty cool if you could I don't know you never know

28
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:34,199
[SPEAKER_08]: What about just being able to cross through the tunnel and you go into Grand Theft Auto Jersey?

29
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Xbox comes with a new attachment that will make your entire house smell like New Jersey.

30
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:42,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Kidding!

31
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:43,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Jersey.

32
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:44,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you guys.

33
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:50,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto Newark, Grand Theft Auto Mount Vernon.

34
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:51,583
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your thoughts, Loki?

35
00:03:51,603 --> 00:03:53,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think there's any possible legitimacy to this?

36
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:53,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

37
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:16,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's going to be as ambitious as, say, a brand new city, but I think that they will add portions of the map or add new stuff as far as... Maybe new islands?

38
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:17,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe little things?

39
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:23,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Because originally they said it was going to be episodic content, so I could see new missions or something like that for the game.

40
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:26,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about whole new portions of the map.

41
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:27,304
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be kind of...

42
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:28,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Big.

43
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:30,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Very ambitious.

44
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:40,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know why they would, you know, I mean, I guess $50 million is a lot of money, you know, to convince them to make these things exclusively for the Xbox 360 version.

45
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:40,427
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

46
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:41,887
[SPEAKER_08]: $15 million is a lot of money.

47
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:50,189
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would think also if that were going to be the case, like they were getting full downloadable islands and stuff like that, wouldn't Microsoft be going, hey, guess what?

48
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,809
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to get full downloadable cities.

49
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:52,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy our version.

50
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, wait a minute.

51
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:53,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it.

52
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,550
[SPEAKER_08]: If Grand Theft Auto is getting downloadable islands from New York,

53
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto, Fire Island

54
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:24,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Travis Donovan live, you know, our buddy who was on Orange Lounge Radio Saturday nights on the old stream of this.

55
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:26,528
[SPEAKER_08]: He is coming to all games.

56
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:27,328
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that much.

57
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:30,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know details yet, but we know he is making the move to all games.

58
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:38,333
[SPEAKER_08]: And so collectively with us moving and Travis moving and Bobby already being there and all the other shows and now there's a new show.

59
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:42,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't Travis Donovan going to be doing something with DMN anyways?

60
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:46,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, I think the new show is then partnered up, but I don't know.

61
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:47,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Secret.

62
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:47,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know the details yet.

63
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:53,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, we refer to it as the Voltron of podcasting, right?

64
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,540
[SPEAKER_08]: The Voltron of gaming podcasting.

65
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And ironically enough, what came to Xbox Live Marketplace this week?

66
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:58,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Voltron.

67
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:04,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And Voltron has a free episode available on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

68
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:06,026
[SPEAKER_08]: You kind of have to dig for it, but it's there.

69
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,308
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a free episode of Voltron available.

70
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:10,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you like free stuff, so go check that out.

71
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:11,609
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

72
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:40,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, and that's exactly why they need to give me the Grand Theft Auto 4 Elite console.

73
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know any nicer way to say this to you.

74
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:46,420
[SPEAKER_08]: You're ineligible, and you're not going to ever be eligible.

75
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,023
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you fucking try to enter this in a fake name or something, you will be caught, and you will be made fun of.

76
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:54,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I will not.

77
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:59,247
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, if you haven't heard, we're giving away an Xbox 360 Elite with the rest of allgames.com.

78
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:01,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Details are in part A. We'll give you more details next week.

79
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:04,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, let's move on with the gaming news.

80
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:05,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Past Voltron.

81
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:19,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like that EA is going to be releasing Rock Band on PS3, PS2, and Wii in Europe for... Wow, did that just shock you into dropping your water?

82
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I was so shocked I actually just dropped my water.

83
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:24,062
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just a klutz.

84
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:26,744
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be coming out on August 29th.

85
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:35,689
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that basically Xbox 360 is going to go, well, crap, we're not the only ones anymore over there.

86
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Crap, crap, crap, crap.

87
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:42,541
[SPEAKER_07]: No one will care because Saints Row 2 will come out around the same time and that game is far superior.

88
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:58,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't stop them from doing that.

89
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:07,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if they win it and they decide they're going to give it to you as a Christmas present, but I tell you what, you owe them the Tingle outfit if they do that for you.

90
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:09,376
[SPEAKER_08]: You fucking owe it to them to do the Tingle outfit.

91
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:10,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Bet be damned.

92
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:15,320
[SPEAKER_08]: If one of these people wins the Xbox for you, you owe it to society to do the Tingle outfit.

93
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,241
[SPEAKER_08]: You wish.

94
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:20,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that if they were... I'm trying to get around this roundabout way.

95
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,133
[SPEAKER_07]: I deserve that system because I love Grand Theft Auto that much.

96
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:25,874
[SPEAKER_07]: But do you love Tingle that much?

97
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't love Tingle that much.

98
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:27,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

99
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:29,016
[SPEAKER_04]: They should give it to me.

100
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,977
[SPEAKER_07]: They have 500 other systems.

101
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:35,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the fuck are they being so stingy with them?

102
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And Misty sums up my thoughts exactly in chat.

103
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,222
[SPEAKER_08]: She says, fuck that.

104
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:38,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Give it to me.

105
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,361
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was just sitting over here saying.

106
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:43,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it to me if you're going to give it to somebody.

107
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:44,624
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to go in the collection.

108
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:46,485
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't play Grand Theft Auto.

109
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:47,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I have.

110
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:48,647
[SPEAKER_08]: You have.

111
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:53,251
[SPEAKER_08]: She wants to suck it into her board collective of gaming crap that is her house.

112
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,692
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to become part of the vault.

113
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And people think I'm joking when I call it the vault, but no.

114
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:02,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan calls it the vault.

115
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:03,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody calls it the vault.

116
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:06,476
[SPEAKER_03]: We need that for the vault.

117
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:09,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I did enter a contest.

118
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:10,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to talk about this a little later.

119
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,660
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, with that...

120
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:15,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Rockstar Social Club Grand Theft Auto Cover

121
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,833
[SPEAKER_07]: See, this is the type of person that does not appreciate a Grand Theft Auto 4 Elite System.

122
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, get past it, people.

123
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Get past it.

124
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:42,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, do we finish with the Rock Band news?

125
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:46,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize, I got derailed by the... Actually, there's one more bit about that.

126
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,340
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

127
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought that it might be interesting that...

128
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,168
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ferret can't fucking win that system either, just for the record.

129
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Neither can any of his family.

130
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:04,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, I would like to know if there is still another Ferret attached to a Katamari somewhere in Namco's headquarters.

131
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:05,530
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

132
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a pretty sizable present for Amazon for my birthday.

133
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I might order another Ferret if they still own Amazon.

134
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:13,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Lordy.

135
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:16,752
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the last thing we need on OLR is for the Ferrets to mate.

136
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:18,665
[SPEAKER_08]: We need mini ferrets.

137
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:19,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Many mini ferrets.

138
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:46,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Splinter Cell Chaos Theory and Metal Arms are coming to Xbox Live Originals.

139
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,560
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get both of those games available for 1,200 Microsoft points.

140
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,322
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be on there actually tomorrow or Monday.

141
00:10:57,242 --> 00:11:00,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, that's pretty awesome.

142
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,944
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be available everywhere except for Korea and Japan.

143
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:07,946
[SPEAKER_07]: No Splinter Cell Chaos Theory for Korea or Japan.

144
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to derail the show again, but I have to.

145
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, you have to check out the link I just posted in chat.

146
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:17,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I typed Scoozy, which is the name of the little pet.

147
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:22,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I typed it into Google, and the first thing that came up was a real ferret versus a Scoozy.

148
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:26,529
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's some really cute pictures in here of the ferret cuddling up with the Scoozy.

149
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,311
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have to check that out.

150
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,812
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it looks like he's trying to eat it in one of those pictures.

151
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:35,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that one because it looks like the ferret has the scoozie on his head.

152
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:38,175
[SPEAKER_08]: And it reminds me of the bunny with the pancake on its head.

153
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:39,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love it.

154
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:41,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so cute.

155
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:43,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I want a ferret, okay?

156
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:47,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at the little thingies on the ferret.

157
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:51,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we have an update from BlackWolf about Loki's eligibility for the contest.

158
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:53,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the official word from...

159
00:11:54,901 --> 00:12:08,065
[SPEAKER_08]: LordBobbyBlackWolf I think that's his official title over at AllGames.com He's LordBobbyBlackWolf He says, maybe I'll let Loki enter the contest if he wears a Tingle costume to the next two OLRs and sit on the cam the entire time, no hiding No!

160
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:12,327
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not acceptable You dare say no to LordBobby?

161
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:16,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not belittle my Grand Theft Auto fanboyism, okay?

162
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:20,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I know he's going to try and do it too.

163
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,977
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to try to enter as somebody else or send it to his friend.

164
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:26,279
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's where you forget.

165
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I am more lazy than you will ever believe.

166
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:34,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So do I really have time to make something and send it in?

167
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:34,906
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

168
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:35,207
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

169
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:35,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

170
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:35,907
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

171
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:37,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, back to gaming news.

172
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:38,709
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to get past this.

173
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag is coming up as well.

174
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:44,214
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have emails to send in, mailbag at orange launch radio dot com.

175
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:44,975
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

176
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,572
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a cool sounding game in name alone.

177
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:50,193
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Afro Samurai.

178
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:54,717
[SPEAKER_08]: You might notice an animated series that has Samuel L. Jackson doing some voices in it.

179
00:12:55,157 --> 00:13:00,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox 360 and PS3 is getting a version of Afro Samurai this fall.

180
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:04,625
[SPEAKER_08]: And the game will follow Afro as he is seeking revenge for the murder of his father.

181
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:08,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And he is, quote, fighting to become the number one warrior.

182
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:11,330
[SPEAKER_08]: The game will follow the storyline in the series.

183
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh...

184
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:37,172
[SPEAKER_08]: You know you just want to know if Samuel L. Jackson is going to be doing the dialogue He is, so there you have it The musical score will also be done by RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan Sweet So it sounds pretty authentic If you're a fan of the show, you'll probably be a fan of the game Afro Samurai But if you hate it, then well, you probably won't want it There was actually an art book for it at Kinokuniya yesterday when I was there

185
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,059
[SPEAKER_08]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com

186
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:07,434
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is going to reach into the mailbag and pull out a favorite email of hers and read it.

187
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:08,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now.

188
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:10,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Or two or five.

189
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:12,156
[SPEAKER_03]: We have actually a few.

190
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:14,057
[SPEAKER_03]: First email!

191
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:15,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Dun dun dun.

192
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:15,777
[SPEAKER_03]: From Gerardimo.

193
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:17,818
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, Hello OLR.

194
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:24,601
[SPEAKER_03]: While I wasn't surprised with the story the other week about one kid shooting his friend over not getting his turn while playing a video game, I did realize this.

195
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:30,123
[SPEAKER_03]: The media says that video games promote violence and it really seems like they only promote gun violence.

196
00:14:30,623 --> 00:14:32,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the media only covers gun violence.

197
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Has there ever been a story about one person beating another person to death after playing Tekken?

198
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:39,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

199
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:45,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anybody tried to use the Calamitic Symphony on their friend when they lose in Soul Calibur?

200
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:46,314
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

201
00:14:46,794 --> 00:14:48,796
[SPEAKER_03]: But kudos to anyone who can do that in the real world.

202
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:53,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anyone been beat over the head with a shovel after playing Viva Pinata?

203
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:53,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Nuh-uh.

204
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think that when people say games promote violence, do you think that they should say that they promote gun violence instead?

205
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:06,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it seems like that is the only violent action people take and blame on games.

206
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:14,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Or people should just stop blaming it singly on games and maybe consider it's the whole picture.

207
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:19,501
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when I say the whole picture, I mean all forms of movies and other types of entertainment.

208
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:21,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Most importantly, when the parents aren't watching...

209
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:25,029
[SPEAKER_08]: and not telling their kids what's right and wrong.

210
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,070
[SPEAKER_03]: There's already freaking problems with the kids.

211
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,952
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, put them in an institution since you don't want to do your damn job anyway.

212
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:32,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Send them to boot camp.

213
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:33,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Call Maury.

214
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:40,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email from GS68 says, Hey Loki, hey Jamie, hey Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

215
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:42,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

216
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I come once again to bring up the issue of recent games being too easy.

217
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps this is what gamers want.

218
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:54,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed that, for example, the House of the Dead 2 and 3 Return is not getting a lot of good reception because of its limited continues.

219
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:59,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Compare this to Ghost Squad, which has unlimited continues, which I don't see anyone whining about.

220
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:02,871
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, many welcome it as it allows them to never die.

221
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:09,219
[SPEAKER_03]: So games may be getting easier, yes, but is this a good thing to make games less frustrating so that more can enjoy them?

222
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,220
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

223
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,525
[SPEAKER_03]: This email was brought to you by Olive Garden, the home of never-ending boots to the head.

224
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,233
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

225
00:16:40,908 --> 00:17:00,119
[SPEAKER_08]: so I'm hoping there's something maybe that will come out for that a little later for those folks that are whining it's too difficult because some people some people just want to blast through it to say they blast through it but then of course I understand there's the hardcore gamers that want to say they did it and they were first too if that makes sense so well next email then sure

226
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Orange Lounge Radio, I have no gamer tag or ID.

227
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:06,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I mainly played handhelds and the Wii.

228
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I am fortunate that I have a job where I am required to sit and wait for action so I get through my fair share of handheld games.

229
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:26,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big fan of listening to you for over a year now and I am a tart of a listener listening to over a dozen gaming podcasts regularly and find it interesting to see how when a story appears on one site it dissipates through the others.

230
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:28,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, that was an accident.

231
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:29,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mean to hit the ferret.

232
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm often smirky at your I wish statements.

233
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:37,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember a few weeks back on one of your future wishes was a TV on your mobile.

234
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:46,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in the UK, I have that for over 50 pence for 24 hour, I'm sorry, for 50 pence for a 24 hour period.

235
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:49,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I can watch actual television or I can play monthly fee for less overall.

236
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:52,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Covering the major terrestrial channels in MTV, etc.

237
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:59,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, in this week's Part A, number 275, you mentioned, why can't I have... Can I jump in real quick about the TV on the mobile thing?

238
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually do have TV on my mobile, but it sucks.

239
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:06,683
[SPEAKER_08]: And you only get limited channels, which are practically infomercials.

240
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:10,766
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not at the same level that it's at in other countries yet.

241
00:18:10,786 --> 00:18:13,868
[SPEAKER_03]: The technology is years behind here.

242
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:15,269
[SPEAKER_08]: It leaves a lot to be desired.

243
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:18,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's because people have their heads up their asses, but moving forward.

244
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:23,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in this week's part A, number 275, you mentioned, why can't I have a white wave bird with Rumble?

245
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:25,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had one for over six months.

246
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:30,440
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the major gaming store chains in the UK has an unofficial one, see link below.

247
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:40,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is www.game.co.uk slash we slash hardware slash accessory slash...

248
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:51,640
[SPEAKER_03]: TildaR330970 GameWare-Wii-Wireless-GameCube-Control-Pad Just go to game.co.uk and look in the Wii section.

249
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:56,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It works perfectly as I bought a Wave Bird for when Brawl comes out over here.

250
00:18:57,324 --> 00:19:00,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And out of the two, I prefer the white game controller as it has the rumble.

251
00:19:01,486 --> 00:19:05,547
[SPEAKER_03]: At 15 pounds, 30 pounds... My apologies.

252
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:09,189
[SPEAKER_03]: At 13 pounds, $30 I think is very reasonable.

253
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:11,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also favoring the wheel on Mario Karts.

254
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm averaging a third or fourth place online and winning all of my races offline so far.

255
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:26,318
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've also liked was when I first went online with my Wii, I forgot to stop my PC hogging the internet and was thrown off during early setup stages.

256
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:28,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I was automatically penalized about 40 points.

257
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:36,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Although this hurt, I was delighted to see that if you drop off as a bad sport, it will cost you on your achievement score.

258
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:37,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers, Mark from Plymouth.

259
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad for the penalties as well when you drop out of there.

260
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:42,692
[SPEAKER_03]: This is funny.

261
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:45,414
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Plymouth, England, where the Mayflower set off.

262
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:47,516
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, my local pub is called the Mayflower.

263
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:48,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

264
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Some good perspectives from overseas.

265
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:57,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you have to remember sometimes the peripherals are different from one side of the pond to the other.

266
00:19:58,504 --> 00:20:01,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even think that probably Europe already has had that white.

267
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:04,548
[SPEAKER_08]: But we had a white... No, I guess we didn't have a white wave bird before.

268
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:05,309
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the old...

269
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:07,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I guess I never really had them in white.

270
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,811
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not really the color that makes a lick of difference.

271
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:18,674
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the fact that they're kind of having a resurgence, you know, in light of the fact that the GameCube is, for all practical purposes, a dead system over here.

272
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:19,674
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't really make new ones.

273
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,975
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to see that they're, you know, doing the way.

274
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:25,616
[SPEAKER_08]: But that is interesting that you have that particular store over in the UK.

275
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:27,357
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been supporting it the whole time.

276
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:28,757
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you have it.

277
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:31,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there more emails?

278
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,381
[SPEAKER_03]: There are quite a few, actually.

279
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:35,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And moving forward.

280
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:44,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, OLR, I'm writing this email on remote play on my PS3, and I want to let you guys know about a workaround for the internet browser password protection.

281
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:51,270
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go into Folding at Home and go to the team stats, all you have to do is find a team whose homepage links to Google.

282
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It says Try Google, and off you go.

283
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:57,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Particularly helpful against tech-minded parents.

284
00:20:58,514 --> 00:20:58,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops!

285
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:02,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, PK... Is it PKJr92?

286
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:05,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that sounds right.

287
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:07,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he friended me on Myspace recently.

288
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:08,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I like his quote.

289
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:11,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, Change is inevitable except from a vending machine.

290
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:12,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard that before.

291
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:14,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's a good quote.

292
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:15,697
[SPEAKER_08]: What else have I heard?

293
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:17,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Change is inevitable... Wait, no.

294
00:21:17,418 --> 00:21:17,818
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?

295
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,758
[SPEAKER_08]: You can avoid most things except death and taxes and sometimes you can cheat death.

296
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:22,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

297
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,979
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a similar quote in my messed up mind.

298
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:26,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, OLR!

299
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:31,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to comment on Jamie saying she didn't want her gaming system to perform as anything but gaming system.

300
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:35,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I, of course, am a PSP owner, and currently that is my only system.

301
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:42,345
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason that it is my only system is that next-gen consoles are too expensive for me right now, but I still like to play on the go, and this suits me better.

302
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:45,987
[SPEAKER_03]: The multifunction of the PSP was a major selling point for me.

303
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:53,472
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that my first introduction to OLR was on the PSP fanboy site, in which they mentioned their favorite podcast, and out of all the ones listed, I tried them all.

304
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:54,312
[SPEAKER_03]: OLR was the best.

305
00:21:54,352 --> 00:21:54,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

306
00:21:55,413 --> 00:22:02,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the RSS feed saved on my PSP and I plug it into my car stereo and listen to each week's show during my 30 minute commute to work all week.

307
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:05,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a sense, I would never have heard of Olar without my PSP.

308
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:06,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Shocking, huh?

309
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, my cell phone can do a lot of that crap, but it can't play a decent game.

310
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope Sky is feeling better.

311
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Viva la PSP.

312
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:13,322
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

313
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:17,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I might own a next-gen system or two if I had enough money to buy and collect pinball machines.

314
00:22:17,884 --> 00:22:18,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha.

315
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:19,245
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from Circe523.

316
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:27,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and by the way, the pinball machines came about because my husband got hit by a car when he was 13.

317
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:29,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Got run over by a truck.

318
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:31,969
[SPEAKER_03]: We get a little bit of money every five years.

319
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:33,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed it's like buying a house.

320
00:22:33,806 --> 00:22:36,107
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll buy a fixer-upper and then fix it and then sell it for more than it was before.

321
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:40,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It also doesn't help that he has worked as managers at a couple different video game stores.

322
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:41,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

323
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:03,774
[SPEAKER_03]: We've looked into all that, and all of our old stuff, we've gone to flea markets.

324
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:21,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, as far as the PSP goes, I still appreciate it for being the multi-system that it is, doing everything it does, and you kind of give an example of that, is a lot of people use a PSP as kind of like their, not quite iPod, but, you know, MP3 playing device as it is.

325
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:24,672
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my coworkers uses his for that, just about only.

326
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:27,154
[SPEAKER_08]: And hey, it plays games and serves the net too, so why not?

327
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:27,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

328
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:35,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know, and especially after kind of really only having a PSP while I was on vacation this weekend, those things can really do quite a bit.

329
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:37,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoy it.

330
00:23:37,197 --> 00:23:38,337
[SPEAKER_08]: And those screens are so pretty.

331
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:39,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't stop saying it.

332
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:43,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody, by the way, in our forums wants to create an OLR theme for the PSP.

333
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:47,318
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there was kind of one on the OLR PSP site, but I think they want one updated.

334
00:23:47,498 --> 00:23:51,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's just a wallpaper that we have on our site.

335
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:53,179
[SPEAKER_07]: They're talking about an actual theme.

336
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:56,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought about doing it, but then again, once again, going back to how lazy I am.

337
00:23:57,841 --> 00:23:59,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hopefully the listeners will actually finish it.

338
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:04,545
[SPEAKER_08]: But I saw that going on on the forums, so that'll be fun because you can pimp out your PSP with OLR propaganda.

339
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:05,786
[SPEAKER_08]: That's always fun.

340
00:24:06,755 --> 00:24:07,395
[SPEAKER_03]: That is.

341
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:20,239
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, I think that what I had clarified my statement in adding is that if what you want it for is the multiple use, that's fine, but it's not a selling point for me.

342
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,181
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would rather have a system that's got more fun games on it, I think.

343
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:27,501
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just looking games to games.

344
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's kind of what I pick up from you.

345
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:30,522
[SPEAKER_08]: You're looking at games to games.

346
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,803
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look at games on the DS, you're like, that's where it's at for me.

347
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:37,709
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP is primarily a gaming system.

348
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,610
[SPEAKER_03]: It just happens to do all this other crap.

349
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:47,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas when I bought my iPhone, I bought it not just because it was a phone, but because I needed a PDA.

350
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:50,613
[SPEAKER_03]: When I bought it, it was my PDA slash phone.

351
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:56,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So, see, it just depends on the purpose you're purchasing it for.

352
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,936
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a couple more emails, though.

353
00:24:58,116 --> 00:24:58,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

354
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:01,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this one comes from Robert M.

355
00:25:21,517 --> 00:25:26,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Also as a Mac user, I'm pretty happy Sam & Mac Season 1 is coming to the Wii.

356
00:25:26,464 --> 00:25:35,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine, of course, considering the PS3 port, that'd be any chance of a Wii portal with a weighted companion GameCube.

357
00:25:37,008 --> 00:25:37,688
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be funny.

358
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,670
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a damn good question about Steam.

359
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no idea that that was part of the requirements for registering it until you sent that email.

360
00:25:43,632 --> 00:25:44,552
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of surprising.

361
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:45,233
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.

362
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,333
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the damn difference?

363
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:46,874
[SPEAKER_08]: There really isn't.

364
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:53,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if they're doing that for the copy protection things or whatever it might be, but very interesting that you have to register your game on Steam.

365
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:59,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there's some people, though, they don't want to put their credit card out there on the internet, so this is a way of doing it.

366
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:00,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Team Fortress 2.

367
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:04,978
[SPEAKER_08]: They just said four of the orange box games.

368
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:07,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he specifically say which game it was?

369
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:08,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed it.

370
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:11,604
[SPEAKER_03]: He just said he grabbed one of the boxes.

371
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's assume it's probably all of them.

372
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:15,027
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's one of them, it's probably all of them.

373
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:16,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

374
00:26:16,804 --> 00:26:18,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to find the email again.

375
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:18,365
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

376
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:20,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Ross Steel UT says to prevent early release.

377
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't really see that, though, because the games have been on Steam forever.

378
00:26:26,115 --> 00:26:28,197
[SPEAKER_08]: And it happens on all Half-Life 2 games.

379
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:29,058
[SPEAKER_03]: It's marketing.

380
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is just marketing, I think.

381
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,046
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you put something... The more something is out there, the more people are going to see it.

382
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:35,566
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how...

383
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, it helps that Valve owns Steam.

384
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, don't question it.

385
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:42,010
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably some type of cross-promotion.

386
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,873
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably just using Steam in general as their registration source.

387
00:26:46,993 --> 00:26:55,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because I honestly would rather have the physical copy, I think, than having downloaded it.

388
00:26:56,024 --> 00:26:57,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally get what this guy is saying, though.

389
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:58,746
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't mind registering it online.

390
00:26:59,186 --> 00:26:59,966
[SPEAKER_08]: But what if you do?

391
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:03,989
[SPEAKER_08]: What if you don't want to put your information out there and all that stuff?

392
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:06,150
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, some people don't want to give that stuff away.

393
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,811
[SPEAKER_08]: So it does kind of suck that they're being forced to do it.

394
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:13,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you have to... If you buy Photoshop, you have to register it and send them all your information.

395
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:18,097
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you buy... When you buy The Sims...

396
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:19,818
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to register it.

397
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,779
[SPEAKER_03]: When you play World of Warcraft, you set up an account.

398
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:25,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I'm thinking, I don't know, maybe I'm just going back to old school.

399
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:32,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, if I walked in and I bought Orange Box for the Xbox 360, sure, I get that little registration card, but half of us throw those things away.

400
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,025
[SPEAKER_08]: You just plop it in, you go.

401
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:35,005
[SPEAKER_08]: No questions asked.

402
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:37,607
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but then again, maybe it's stealing everything from Xbox Live.

403
00:27:37,787 --> 00:27:38,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

404
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:46,131
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I think part of the whole reason why they're being a little bit more on it with the registration is just to make sure that you don't have a pirated copy.

405
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:47,792
[SPEAKER_03]: That your copy is legit.

406
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:48,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

407
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't necessarily have a problem with it.

408
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:55,981
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just I do find it kind of weird because I would understand why somebody might go to the store to buy it because they don't want to use Steam.

409
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:56,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I use Steam.

410
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:57,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought Portal off Steam.

411
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:04,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a problem with it, but I could see why somebody might have bought the retail version just not wanting to deal with that.

412
00:28:04,526 --> 00:28:09,389
[SPEAKER_08]: And to find out they have to deal with it anyway, well, I guess that I can see why I might be kind of pissed.

413
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:10,590
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, one more email.

414
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:13,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLodgeRadio.com I thought you said there was one more.

415
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:14,756
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I said there's a few more.

416
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, damn it.

417
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:16,417
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of long, too.

418
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:20,960
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.

419
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,642
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, and I'm going to mispronounce this because I took French, okay?

420
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:27,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Feliz cumpleaños.

421
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:28,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Close.

422
00:28:29,285 --> 00:28:31,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Feliz cumpleaños, I think, is it.

423
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:32,207
[SPEAKER_03]: To Jamie.

424
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:32,867
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what that means?

425
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:33,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Birthday?

426
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:34,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday!

427
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:38,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you had a great day.

428
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:38,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Smiley face.

429
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:40,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have a good day.

430
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very busy.

431
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,923
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got free gelato at Naya.

432
00:28:43,384 --> 00:28:44,686
[SPEAKER_03]: They had Guinness gelato.

433
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:46,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

434
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:47,009
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fucking good.

435
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:50,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, their black sesame was not very good.

436
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:58,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And second, because of internet issues, I couldn't listen to the last show on live, not 365, and the first on all games.

437
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:07,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, I could get hold of the podcast and get my OLR fixed for the week, and the show may be on another stream, but it's still as good as it ever was, and in better sound quality, too.

438
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:07,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearts.

439
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Now for the serious stuff.

440
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:19,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hearing the podcast for last week's show and you were talking about bullies banning in Brazil and you were asking if Latin American countries had some kind of... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

441
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I think I just lost my connection.

442
00:29:23,464 --> 00:29:24,164
[SPEAKER_08]: So what?

443
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:26,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I just lost my interwebs.

444
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:27,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know what?

445
00:29:28,036 --> 00:29:28,757
[SPEAKER_08]: We're having problems.

446
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:33,382
[SPEAKER_08]: The Justin TV cam went down too, so something is wrong with the wireless networking.

447
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:36,546
[SPEAKER_08]: So while I set up... Do you still have that one email on your screen?

448
00:29:36,686 --> 00:29:36,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

449
00:29:36,986 --> 00:29:40,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so keep reading that while we try to set up the jerry-rig real quick.

450
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

451
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:44,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the games and stuff that sold in Latin America...

452
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:47,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Now for the serious stuff.

453
00:29:47,658 --> 00:29:54,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hearing the podcast for last week's show, and you were talking about bullies banning in Brazil, and you were asking if Latin American countries had some kind of rating for games.

454
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:58,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like Foodie said last week, Chile has it, but basically that's it.

455
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:09,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the games and stuff that is sold in Latin American stores isn't popularly rated for the audience it's targeted, and only has the ESRB rating, but still it isn't an obligatory thing for retailers to follow.

456
00:30:09,637 --> 00:30:17,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically any child can go into the store and buy Grand Theft Auto with no problems at all, as a basic example since it's one of the best selling games in Latin America.

457
00:30:18,245 --> 00:30:29,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Although some stores do follow that ESRB rating and do not sell an M game to a minor, or at least younger kids, but there aren't that many that do so, yet it is basically up to the parents to say yes or no.

458
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:33,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Although there's another factor in play that isn't related to this, the game's retail value.

459
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:38,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games in Mexico cost at least 25% more than in the U.S.

460
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,524
[SPEAKER_03]: So video games are kind of like a luxury here.

461
00:30:40,744 --> 00:30:45,926
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the cheapest console is the Wii, which costs almost double what it costs in the U.S.

462
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So not many people buy games.

463
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:55,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they do buy cheap ones, like, for example, bargain bin titles or low-budget ones, which brings us to another problem, piracy.

464
00:30:56,871 --> 00:31:04,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Last month, I made a comment on a Skype call that an article stating that Mexico's video game industry is going to be worth $1 billion in two years from now.

465
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:12,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I wonder how they are going to manage piracy in Mexico, which is one of the worldwide leading piracy markets for almost everything.

466
00:31:13,215 --> 00:31:16,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And if retailers don't care about their ratings, well, you get the idea.

467
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:37,076
[SPEAKER_03]: the most people or the main public are also ignorant in knowing which are the games to get basically don't know if a game is good or bad or it's just a game hence why titles like Cars got into the best selling games list of 2006 the same goes for other titles like FIFA or PES and any anime game title DBZ for example

468
00:31:37,957 --> 00:31:46,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the end, it's just basically a cultural thing since most of Latin America is accustomed to different things than the US and Canada, especially in the way media is handled.

469
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:50,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you can watch someone holding and firing a gun in daytime, afternoon TV.

470
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:56,574
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have the chance to watch any Mexican news shows or similar, do so and you'll understand what I am talking about.

471
00:31:57,194 --> 00:32:01,638
[SPEAKER_03]: On a side note, Mexican congressmen don't want a video game...

472
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:03,099
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

473
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:05,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, when are we going to give away the ResHD code?

474
00:32:27,824 --> 00:32:28,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

475
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:46,167
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to just give it away.

476
00:32:46,468 --> 00:32:49,809
[SPEAKER_08]: At some point, we're just going to set up an email and try to get it out that way.

477
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,911
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, if you switch networks, we should be back up.

478
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,072
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the JerryRig network up.

479
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:58,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to get back in chat, so I won't be able to do it.

480
00:32:58,074 --> 00:32:58,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Switcheroos!

481
00:33:00,555 --> 00:33:01,276
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

482
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:02,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

483
00:33:03,077 --> 00:33:04,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it went over one of the emails.

484
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:04,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

485
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:10,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yeah, it's been two months since it was given to me.

486
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:11,666
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't given it away.

487
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:12,907
[SPEAKER_03]: PSS.

488
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:20,731
[SPEAKER_03]: The PS reminded me that Q Entertainment is doing a special kind of survey in which you can ask Tetsuya Mizuguchi a question for their newsletter.

489
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:24,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you haven't already said so on the show, perhaps it's only ten questions that will be picked.

490
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:32,938
[SPEAKER_03]: More info is on that game called res.com slash vbulletin slash showthread dot php question mark t equals 90.

491
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:38,900
[SPEAKER_03]: PSSS, Second Life on Cellphones, I'm a furry and I find that highly hilarious.

492
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:45,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be curious to know from Mizuguchi if 99 Nights is something they're going to try to do again.

493
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:52,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because I know that game got a lot of slack when it first came out, but there's a good game in there somewhere, and maybe they could get it on a second go.

494
00:33:52,905 --> 00:34:00,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, I would hope maybe they could do I don't know, maybe Gun Pay on Xbox Live Arcade.

495
00:34:00,688 --> 00:34:01,709
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what happens with that.

496
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:02,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh,

497
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:07,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're going to... We've got one more email.

498
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it up on the screen?

499
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,662
[SPEAKER_04]: We have more emails.

500
00:34:10,863 --> 00:34:12,004
[SPEAKER_08]: My God, it keeps growing.

501
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:13,146
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not keep growing.

502
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:14,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you that we had several.

503
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:30,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, this afternoon I was bored so I thought what the hell why not randomly make 10 questions to ask you guys because you know that's the first thing that comes to everyone's mind when they're bored, right?

504
00:34:31,442 --> 00:34:30,641
1.

505
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:34,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, what's your favorite galaxy in Super Mario Galaxies?

506
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:39,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And Osfer says, I love Space Junk Galaxy because it pretty much has gravity.

507
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Who gives a shit?

508
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,512
[SPEAKER_03]: The music is all relaxing too.

509
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:45,106
[SPEAKER_08]: The Bumblebee Galaxy, because you can be a bumblebee and that's the best thing in the game.

510
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:47,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Bee Mario.

511
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:48,107
[SPEAKER_03]: A question for me.

512
00:34:48,908 --> 00:34:50,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, what's your favorite pinball game?

513
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:53,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says he doesn't play much pinball, but he likes the Gilligan's Island Machine.

514
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:57,491
[SPEAKER_03]: World Cup Soccer 94, without a doubt.

515
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:01,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what is your favorite course out of all the Mario Kart series?

516
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:03,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says that he likes Rainbow Road from Mario Kart 64.

517
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate Mario Kart's Rainbow Road.

518
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:08,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

519
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:15,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say probably... I like Wario Stadium from Nintendo 64 a lot.

520
00:35:16,162 --> 00:35:18,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, a lot of the courses from 64 are pretty awesome.

521
00:35:19,923 --> 00:35:22,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I would probably say... I don't know.

522
00:35:23,084 --> 00:35:24,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably Wario Stadium.

523
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:26,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the most that I've played, is that one.

524
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:29,705
[SPEAKER_07]: That, and also, I don't remember what it's called.

525
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:33,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was Peach's Circuit or something like that.

526
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:36,667
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one that's got the giant ramp from Nintendo 64.

527
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:38,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

528
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:41,138
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'd say probably Wario Stadium.

529
00:35:41,618 --> 00:35:42,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Toad's Highway.

530
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:43,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I wasn't asked this question.

531
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Toad's Highway is pretty awesome too.

532
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Freaking love Toad's Highway.

533
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:51,745
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

534
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:54,607
[SPEAKER_08]: What would be your dream Mario Kart course in a future Mario game?

535
00:35:56,069 --> 00:36:01,356
[SPEAKER_07]: They should do one that's all pixelated and 8-bit like Super Mario Bros.

536
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:02,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that'd be pretty cool.

537
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:03,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

538
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:05,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Mode 7-tastic.

539
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:08,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a better Haunted Mansion course.

540
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:11,989
[SPEAKER_07]: One that's actually kind of a bit of platforming and stuff.

541
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:12,690
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be pretty cool.

542
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:30,940
[SPEAKER_07]: or one that's what they need to do is add the characters some of the characters from Mario RPG into a future one like including that one villain guy who was raining around the entire time nice I don't remember his name but we have a fan of Moo Moo Farm in the house Frisbee likes Moo Moo is that the one with the train?

543
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:34,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that one Moo Moo Farm is fun

544
00:36:36,558 --> 00:37:03,819
[SPEAKER_03]: good times alright the next question is this is for all three of us who are your favorite brawl characters and Osfer says Wolf O'Donnell is mine obviously his howling taunt is amazing and he fights like a dream I'm just going to really go back to my favorite of all time I was a big Sheik person but Kirby was always my person I love Ness but I think I just I freaking love Pit in this new one too much

545
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

546
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:11,062
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite character?

547
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:20,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked... Actually... I liked Rob.

548
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob the Robot.

549
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:22,109
[SPEAKER_07]: That was fun.

550
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I like me too.

551
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:25,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm great.

552
00:37:26,172 --> 00:37:26,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.

553
00:37:27,052 --> 00:37:27,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

554
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:30,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, what would you do if World of Warcraft was shut down and you could never play it again?

555
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:32,155
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I hate World of Warcraft.

556
00:37:32,236 --> 00:37:34,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd go back to Final Fantasy XI just to piss you off.

557
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:35,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's one for me.

558
00:37:35,534 --> 00:37:36,735
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, here's a toughie for you.

559
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:42,019
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, what console do you think will come out on top in this gen's console wars, PS3, 360, or the Wii?

560
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:45,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And he thinks it's between the 360 and the Wii, but I'll have to say Wii.

561
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:49,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my PS3, but... Yeah.

562
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:49,764
360.

563
00:37:51,565 --> 00:37:55,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it's got the online play perfect.

564
00:37:55,948 --> 00:37:59,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as perfect as it can be, given current technology.

565
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:01,932
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a really great library.

566
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:04,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of stuff that's for people of...

567
00:38:05,214 --> 00:38:07,815
[SPEAKER_03]: any age and type of game that they like.

568
00:38:08,395 --> 00:38:09,955
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty versatile, I'd have to say.

569
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:17,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to say the 360 in terms of, first of all, it already had an audience when it came out.

570
00:38:17,818 --> 00:38:21,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, the learning curve was really, really small on it.

571
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:24,040
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I'm right.

572
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,400
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty.

573
00:38:25,876 --> 00:38:26,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Last question for Loki.

574
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:28,598
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the last one.

575
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:30,440
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your favorite game and why?

576
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:36,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, Final Fantasy X is the only game to ever make me pull an all-nighter, so I'd have to say that, and the runner-up is Brawl.

577
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:39,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I don't know.

578
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,328
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends when you ask me.

579
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:46,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you're asking me now, I'd probably say, um, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is pretty fun.

580
00:38:47,374 --> 00:38:47,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

581
00:38:47,774 --> 00:38:48,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I play a lot of things in a row.

582
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:49,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

583
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:51,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a favorite game.

584
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:56,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like to pick one that's just favorite because I go from one to another, you know, all the time.

585
00:38:56,813 --> 00:39:02,197
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, I'd say right now Saints Row, but I know that's not my absolute favorite.

586
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:05,600
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite game is Super Metroid, but most of chat already knew that.

587
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what mine is.

588
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:09,102
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

589
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:09,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Guardian Legend.

590
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:11,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So enough of wasting your time.

591
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:12,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I went about that faceplate.

592
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:14,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your time with it, and I understand you guys have enough to manage.

593
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:18,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still working on getting one, but I think someone else is supposed to bring one.

594
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got all the stuff to work on it.

595
00:39:21,121 --> 00:39:21,702
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll figure it out.

596
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:22,903
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk amongst ourselves.

597
00:39:23,163 --> 00:39:24,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for reading, Osfer.

598
00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:24,564
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

599
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:26,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I hope your pancreas get better.

600
00:39:26,926 --> 00:39:27,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so, too.

601
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:29,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you would come to ASIN, Krize.

602
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:30,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I would, too.

603
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:31,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you would come to ASIN as well.

604
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:38,317
[SPEAKER_08]: However, Penny Arcade Expo is like 95% certain for me at this point.

605
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:41,220
[SPEAKER_03]: The last email.

606
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God.

607
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.

608
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:43,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, RawStillUT.

609
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:45,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, RawStillUT.

610
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:54,652
[SPEAKER_03]: DC vs. Mortal Kombat, a horrifying concept, not because of graphics.

611
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:56,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Mortal Kombat hasn't used mocap graphics in ages.

612
00:39:56,912 --> 00:39:58,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I was bringing that up as an example.

613
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:03,034
[SPEAKER_03]: But because, according to Kotaku, there isn't going to be any fatalities, the blood will be incredibly limited.

614
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:04,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the hell would anyone bother?

615
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:05,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've covered that.

616
00:40:06,894 --> 00:40:08,095
[SPEAKER_03]: The fighting styles...

617
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:13,686
[SPEAKER_03]: However that wasn't the main topic I wanted to discuss.

618
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:20,195
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea of higher meaning in games, meaning in art in general.

619
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:28,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You often hear complaints from gamers about games not having esoteric higher meaning compared to other mediums.

620
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:40,199
[SPEAKER_03]: However, many people bring up movies, books, paintings that are either A, really blatant in their meetings, Schindler's List, Blood Diamond, or B, way too damned esoteric and oddball for anyone to get on their own, which is Akira.

621
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:46,546
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, in defense of Akira, it was a cliff note version of a really freaking long manga that

622
00:40:48,038 --> 00:40:49,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to go into it, just read the manga.

623
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:56,622
[SPEAKER_03]: My view has always been that if it's too complex for someone to get without a fucking explanation by the creator, it isn't worth the time.

624
00:40:57,982 --> 00:40:59,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you should watch Shock Treatment then.

625
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:09,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you'll find out what... By the way, this Friday, April 25th in San Francisco, Shock Treatment.

626
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:12,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not performing in it anymore, though, due to my sickness.

627
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:14,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't do rehearsals, but I'm still going.

628
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:17,928
[SPEAKER_03]: My view has always been that if... Okay, I've read that part.

629
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:30,481
[SPEAKER_03]: By the same token, hammering someone over the head with a message and not leaving room for subtle metaphor and commenting comes off as preachy, a primary reason I can barely stand Kojima's sledgehammer style in the Metal Gear Solid series.

630
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:36,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always thought that a metaphor hints at innuendo made the best way to convey a message in entertainment media.

631
00:41:36,587 --> 00:42:05,556
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the way humans generally have distrust of aliens and vice versa in Mass Effect for example while a cliche in and of itself the way it's presented shows just how ugly racism is Final Fantasy 7 had a very strong pro-environment message hidden in the belts and zippers of Nomura's design with Mako and the Lifestream an effective metaphor for the oil we've ripped from the earth and the land and animals we routinely exploit often there is something to be taken other than simple entertainment if you look hard enough

632
00:42:07,436 --> 00:42:11,678
[SPEAKER_03]: and also sometimes small meanings can be found in even the most mundane parts of games.

633
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:18,820
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, there's a part in Rainbow Six Vegas 2 where, warning spoilers, your team is sent in to check three buildings for a bomb.

634
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I read this?

635
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:22,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

636
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Just try to sum it up in one sentence.

637
00:42:25,302 --> 00:42:25,662
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

638
00:42:28,022 --> 00:42:33,324
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically dealing with having to deal with failure instead of it being a game over.

639
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:36,407
[SPEAKER_03]: and instead of game over, start over.

640
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:38,991
[SPEAKER_03]: You failed, you have to deal with it.

641
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:43,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see a video game tell you that.

642
00:42:43,157 --> 00:42:44,880
[SPEAKER_08]: You fail at life, deal with it.

643
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, they set us up the bomb.

644
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:51,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I was more like, you fail, here's your consequences for what you screwed up on.

645
00:42:52,878 --> 00:42:59,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I often wonder if the call for higher meaning in games is just from people who want to join the stuck-up art connoisseur club.

646
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:10,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, I've always found the word art to be nothing more than something old, rich, often white men used to hold up what they prefer while simultaneously putting down anything made by the lower classes as being unworthy of the art designation.

647
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:14,565
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not surprising, in his time, William Shakespeare was considered a lowbrow playwright.

648
00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:18,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, hundreds of years after his death, he's considered one of the greatest playwrights of all time.

649
00:43:19,048 --> 00:43:24,351
[SPEAKER_03]: What isn't heralded for all time won't be decided by us, but by those who come long after and look back.

650
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:31,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one day, stuck-up elites will hold up Lost Odyssey and no more heroes as the pinnacle of art and gaming.

651
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:32,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Just something to think about.

652
00:43:33,175 --> 00:43:35,116
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very interesting point, I must say.

653
00:43:36,357 --> 00:43:42,380
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be very interesting to see what kind of games are truly remembered as classics, and will it be the things that were necessarily popular today?

654
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:42,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

655
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:46,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Another aside, I love the new PlayStation Store.

656
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,542
[SPEAKER_03]: It's even better than Marketplace now.

657
00:43:47,902 --> 00:43:50,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So easy to find everything and the games install automatically now.

658
00:43:50,524 --> 00:43:51,105
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wonderful.

659
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:56,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, and yes, I know I'm rambling, here's another anti-digital distribution warning.

660
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:03,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Way back in 1981, a service called Play Cable came out, which allowed you to download Intellivision games through your cable system.

661
00:44:04,096 --> 00:44:13,523
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is that the adapter only had 4K of RAM and when Intellivision games started coming out in 8K and 16K carts, the play cable service was rendered useless and was discontinued in 1993.

662
00:44:14,163 --> 00:44:18,366
[SPEAKER_03]: The moral of the story is that files will always outgrow bandwidth.

663
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:21,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Who the hell wants to download 50 gigs of Metal Gear Solid 4?

664
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:26,432
[SPEAKER_03]: What about when games start taking up triple or even quadruple layer Blu-ray discs 100 gigs?

665
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:31,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Movie and game files aren't going to stand still for the sake of bandwidth, especially when ISPs are...

666
00:44:32,876 --> 00:44:36,838
[SPEAKER_03]: are heart set on raping consumers for bandwidth in the US, Europe, and especially Australia.

667
00:44:37,499 --> 00:44:40,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're going to be seeing discs for a long, long time.

668
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours truly, Rostil UT.

669
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:43,603
[SPEAKER_03]: That is such a freaking good letter.

670
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:45,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

671
00:44:46,604 --> 00:44:55,089
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to send us good letters, mailbag at orangelauntrader.com, but try to keep it to 500 words or less, just so we have time to read them all in the air.

672
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me something to drink with every email.

673
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:00,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's get back to some gaming news.

674
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:04,546
[SPEAKER_08]: and we'll go to Loki about Bionic Commando, yes?

675
00:45:05,007 --> 00:45:24,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Bionic Commando Rearmed has been rated by the ESRB it is of course rated M and they didn't really specify why it's rated M but it I think has to do with the game's main villain's head exploding

676
00:45:25,217 --> 00:45:28,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome.

677
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like the fact that it's rated.

678
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:33,243
[SPEAKER_07]: That means it's on its way and hopefully will be out very soon.

679
00:45:34,044 --> 00:45:39,068
[SPEAKER_07]: And along with it, hopefully will come Castle Crashers because I hope that game is out very soon as well.

680
00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:41,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

681
00:45:42,978 --> 00:45:45,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I am very excited for Bionic Commando Rearmed.

682
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:47,965
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be hot, because the old one is a hot game.

683
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:55,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on to more Grand Theft Auto stories, but this may not be exactly what you're looking for.

684
00:45:55,676 --> 00:45:59,401
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like there were a lot of pre-orders for Grand Theft Auto 4 in Australia.

685
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:01,483
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

686
00:46:17,352 --> 00:46:18,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a gun up the rectum, I believe.

687
00:46:37,168 --> 00:46:43,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamers are saying they cancelled their orders with Australian shops and will import a cheaper uncut version going around the law.

688
00:46:43,953 --> 00:46:44,553
[SPEAKER_08]: That is true.

689
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:49,496
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 3 is the region free, so there you go.

690
00:46:50,117 --> 00:46:58,062
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in Australia and you want a region free or uncut version of the game, import a... Frisbee wants to know, let me ask a question.

691
00:46:58,082 --> 00:46:59,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Did Saw 4 get shown in Australia?

692
00:47:00,023 --> 00:47:00,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good question.

693
00:47:01,865 --> 00:47:02,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

694
00:47:04,507 --> 00:47:04,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

695
00:47:06,514 --> 00:47:16,497
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very interesting, though, kind of counter-reaction to this, is that you have all these people that are canceling the game and realizing that the PS3 is region-free, so they're just like, you know what?

696
00:47:16,537 --> 00:47:16,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw it.

697
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:17,658
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to import it.

698
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:20,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting combat.

699
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:23,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Some 360 games are region-free, too.

700
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:38,771
[SPEAKER_08]: it'll be interesting to see the further fallout from this but regardless censorship kind of pisses us off and so we dedicate the FUs of the week to all these people that just said FU to the Australian censorship board that are going to import their copies instead

701
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:01,844
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week, um, it's not really directed toward the person, but toward the situation.

702
00:48:02,685 --> 00:48:07,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I got woke up, um, well, I had already woke up once and then passed right back out.

703
00:48:07,548 --> 00:48:12,911
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was woke up from a dead sleep by someone calling me, saying that I left my keys in her car.

704
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:16,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And, Rob, you know what I am when I'm just waking up.

705
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:17,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm incoherent.

706
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:21,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I have no idea what she's talking about.

707
00:48:21,717 --> 00:48:23,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think I'm dreaming, okay?

708
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:25,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, but I need my keys.

709
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:28,140
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, I can't bring them to you.

710
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,141
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the one who left them.

711
00:48:29,161 --> 00:48:31,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And just being really condescending and rude about it.

712
00:48:31,102 --> 00:48:34,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wait, what the hell are you talking about?

713
00:48:34,304 --> 00:48:38,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, she's like, well, you need your... I was like, I need my house key too.

714
00:48:38,726 --> 00:48:39,567
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, you don't have a copy?

715
00:48:39,587 --> 00:48:40,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I don't know.

716
00:48:40,707 --> 00:48:42,388
[SPEAKER_03]: She's just being really rude about it.

717
00:48:42,428 --> 00:48:43,089
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was like, look...

718
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:47,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I just woke up, you don't need to be condescending and rude, okay?

719
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna put up with that shit.

720
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:53,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't put up with it from anybody, if I can help it.

721
00:48:54,793 --> 00:48:58,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, um... F you to, um...

722
00:49:01,946 --> 00:49:04,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I don't really have much else in the way of F.U.

723
00:49:05,307 --> 00:49:05,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, F.U.

724
00:49:05,867 --> 00:49:07,048
[SPEAKER_03]: the stupid kids at the park.

725
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:12,790
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Sonia came over and we took pictures of the doll feed that I finished for Kristen.

726
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:14,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of mine.

727
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,071
[SPEAKER_03]: These stupid kids are like, why are you taking pictures of dolls?

728
00:49:17,091 --> 00:49:19,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, why does anybody take pictures of anything?

729
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:22,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, don't be stupid.

730
00:49:22,053 --> 00:49:22,993
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was it.

731
00:49:24,273 --> 00:49:24,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki.

732
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:26,474
[SPEAKER_07]: F.U.

733
00:49:26,514 --> 00:49:27,655
[SPEAKER_07]: this chair I'm sitting in.

734
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:29,075
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

735
00:49:31,201 --> 00:50:00,462
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to Subway who I suspect gave me food poisoning on my vacation that kept me in bed until 6pm yesterday meaning I missed out on two trips to the beach that kind of pisses me off I mean I guess I should be thankful I got to go on the trip at all because the state of my pancreas was a little bit in question you know with everything I've been going through recently but still food poisoning sucks at least I didn't have it for two weeks people shouldn't be sick on their vacations what kind of horrible punishment is that what did I do to you mother nature

736
00:50:01,018 --> 00:50:01,799
[SPEAKER_08]: What did I do to you?

737
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:04,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's get back into the show.

738
00:50:05,984 --> 00:50:07,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Get back into some more gaming news, eh, Jamie?

739
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:10,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's entirely doable, Rob.

740
00:50:12,332 --> 00:50:12,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, good.

741
00:50:13,422 --> 00:50:13,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

742
00:50:15,422 --> 00:50:16,943
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently Wii games look like crap.

743
00:50:17,783 --> 00:50:18,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Or most of them do.

744
00:50:18,903 --> 00:50:27,705
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the developer High Voltage, they're basically claiming that most of the end products for the Wii don't look as good as latter-day PS2 titles.

745
00:50:28,685 --> 00:50:35,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, of course, after they have said they're working on something called Conduit, which is a first-person shooter boasting...

746
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:40,993
[SPEAKER_03]: to be really advanced and supposed to actually be, I guess, the best one on the system.

747
00:50:43,616 --> 00:50:50,344
[SPEAKER_03]: They're quoted as saying that they think it's a real shame that publishers and developers aren't taking advantage of the technical possibilities of the Wii platform.

748
00:50:50,744 --> 00:50:55,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Most Wii games don't even look as good as Saturday PS2 titles, and that's a real slap to the face of consumers.

749
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:59,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're saying that they're wanting to raise a new bar.

750
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:03,183
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, and how many times have I said this?

751
00:51:03,323 --> 00:51:06,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what the hell the game looks like as long as it's fun.

752
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:08,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

753
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:09,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Their engines look pretty nice.

754
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Katamari Damacy, let's face it, looks like crap.

755
00:51:13,466 --> 00:51:16,808
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of people really enjoy the heck out of that game because it's fun.

756
00:51:17,568 --> 00:51:17,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

757
00:51:19,218 --> 00:51:23,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure the soccer moms of America have been throwing themselves behind the Wii, don't really care.

758
00:51:23,562 --> 00:51:24,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I like to have both.

759
00:51:24,923 --> 00:51:26,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to have a pretty game that's fun.

760
00:51:28,026 --> 00:51:29,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that too much to ask?

761
00:51:29,327 --> 00:51:29,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

762
00:51:29,948 --> 00:51:32,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

763
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:38,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, High Voltage released a tech demo of their new engine, and it does look pretty good.

764
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:39,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Although the graphics...

765
00:51:41,053 --> 00:51:43,875
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii is just two GameCubes duct taped together or whatever?

766
00:52:09,687 --> 00:52:10,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not even that.

767
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:18,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just people are looking at the Wii as a cheap developing platform, and so they're putting no effort into releasing games for it.

768
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:21,854
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just charging like 20 bucks for them, but they're garbage.

769
00:52:22,714 --> 00:52:23,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's the problem.

770
00:52:25,915 --> 00:52:30,778
[SPEAKER_07]: One game that's not quite garbage, though, is coming to Steam pretty soon here.

771
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:31,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Luminous.

772
00:52:32,118 --> 00:52:40,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Q Entertainment and Valve have kind of joined forces, and Luminous will be available on the service.

773
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a few different packs you can get.

774
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:45,467
[SPEAKER_07]: The base pack for $9.95...

775
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:57,699
[SPEAKER_07]: will be available, as well as the advanced pack containing 21 new challenge mode skins, 60 puzzles for puzzle mode, and 35 stages for puzzle mode.

776
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:03,442
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll come out for another $7.95, or you can grab the whole thing for $14.95.

777
00:53:04,902 --> 00:53:08,024
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll be made available Friday, April 25th.

778
00:53:08,224 --> 00:53:12,366
[SPEAKER_08]: If you didn't already have Luminous in one of the 5,000 other places it's available, there's your chance.

779
00:53:13,246 --> 00:53:13,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

780
00:53:13,927 --> 00:53:14,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

781
00:53:14,407 --> 00:53:14,687
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

782
00:53:15,509 --> 00:53:16,250
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

783
00:53:39,526 --> 00:53:43,750
[SPEAKER_08]: When we always have all this bad news about stupid kids, we might have some good news here.

784
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:46,613
[SPEAKER_08]: This has to do with the mother of one teenager.

785
00:53:46,633 --> 00:53:55,501
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened is that this kid was supposed to be doing some chores, but he decided to break the vacuum cleaner so that he didn't have to do any work.

786
00:53:55,901 --> 00:54:03,287
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happened is that the mom went on to Craigslist, and this posting was found on Richmond's Craigslist, and it says this.

787
00:54:03,968 --> 00:54:07,610
[SPEAKER_08]: My son seems to think everything should be handed to him on a silver platter.

788
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:09,631
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Xbox is going bye-bye.

789
00:54:10,031 --> 00:54:13,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have an assortment of games as well that I will sell for $15 each.

790
00:54:13,673 --> 00:54:14,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Price is firm.

791
00:54:14,874 --> 00:54:18,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Must replace vacuum that he broke thinking it would get him out of having to do chores.

792
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:26,359
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, the mother has also informed the world that she's busted him for looking at porn sites.

793
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:37,671
[SPEAKER_08]: The internet access is now locked behind a password, and mom apparently went onto his Myspace and put a picture of Snoopy on the Myspace.

794
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:47,504
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a mom that is taking no crap from her kid and violating his privacy in every sense of the word.

795
00:54:48,745 --> 00:54:49,766
[SPEAKER_08]: But what is the old saying?

796
00:54:49,866 --> 00:54:55,750
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as you live under our house, I will log on to your MySpace and put up pictures of Snoopy.

797
00:54:58,292 --> 00:55:01,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, like GS68 in chat says, it could have been worse.

798
00:55:01,934 --> 00:55:02,795
[SPEAKER_08]: It could have been Hello Kitty.

799
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:07,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Snoopy means she's snooping.

800
00:55:08,136 --> 00:55:09,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there was a pun there.

801
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:13,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job for her bringing the smack down.

802
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:13,580
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.

803
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes kids are brats.

804
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:15,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

805
00:55:16,121 --> 00:55:19,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Selling the Xbox off might be a bit extreme, but I don't know.

806
00:55:19,704 --> 00:55:24,247
[SPEAKER_08]: If this kid has repetitive issues, then maybe it's what has to be done.

807
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to tell you how to raise your kid in that sense.

808
00:55:26,348 --> 00:55:29,991
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's best, but that does seem a little extreme.

809
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:32,712
[SPEAKER_08]: This must have been one bad fucking kid for that to happen.

810
00:55:32,773 --> 00:55:33,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

811
00:55:35,734 --> 00:55:37,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Do Not Want Lovely

812
00:56:05,848 --> 00:56:06,308
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

813
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:07,969
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was a bad kid.

814
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:09,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a bad kid.

815
00:56:09,989 --> 00:56:11,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I was naughty when I was like three or four.

816
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:13,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I was always the bad kid that had to go time out in class.

817
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:15,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I turned into a perfect little angel.

818
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:16,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how I am today.

819
00:56:17,772 --> 00:56:17,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

820
00:56:18,992 --> 00:56:19,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

821
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:21,973
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your halo hung up by horns?

822
00:56:22,334 --> 00:56:22,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, whatever.

823
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:24,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to gaming news.

824
00:56:24,754 --> 00:56:28,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say, we got other games to talk about too.

825
00:56:29,256 --> 00:56:31,537
[SPEAKER_03]: But kudos for that mom for having balls.

826
00:56:31,957 --> 00:56:32,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

827
00:56:34,074 --> 00:56:39,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Our buddies at Namco Bondi have brought us some shooting stuff.

828
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:55,351
[SPEAKER_03]: In the summer, there is Power Up Forever on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, which is a top-down shooter where as you shoot things, you absorb their energy and you grow.

829
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:56,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So you...

830
00:56:59,088 --> 00:57:03,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to compare this with Katamari as the article compares it with Katamari.

831
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:08,612
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I see it as more of expanding your universe.

832
00:57:09,812 --> 00:57:11,113
[SPEAKER_03]: A perspective type thing.

833
00:57:11,173 --> 00:57:13,093
[SPEAKER_03]: The bigger you get, the more you can see.

834
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:27,379
[SPEAKER_03]: As you get more power-ups, you're supposed to see larger and larger enemies that were always there, but you just couldn't see them before because you were a needle.

835
00:57:28,686 --> 00:57:33,729
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's supposed to be like an infinitely going game, I guess.

836
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:39,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It just goes on and on, my friend.

837
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,353
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the game that never ends.

838
00:57:41,513 --> 00:57:43,194
[SPEAKER_08]: It just goes on and on, my friend.

839
00:57:43,214 --> 00:57:44,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate Firefox.

840
00:57:44,774 --> 00:57:45,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate my laptop, actually.

841
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,724
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just thinking, you know, we don't have enough space shooters on Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation 3.

842
00:57:53,024 --> 00:57:54,725
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was really hoping we would get some more.

843
00:57:55,446 --> 00:57:56,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry, Rob.

844
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:57,068
[SPEAKER_08]: They will never do that.

845
00:57:57,088 --> 00:57:58,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Weren't you just thinking that too?

846
00:57:58,689 --> 00:58:01,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, God, what is it we're missing on Xbox Live?

847
00:58:01,592 --> 00:58:02,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Music games?

848
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:03,433
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we have Boom Boom Rocket.

849
00:58:03,453 --> 00:58:04,094
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all we need.

850
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:05,535
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we missing?

851
00:58:05,575 --> 00:58:06,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Adventure games?

852
00:58:06,336 --> 00:58:07,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, we have the Arcadian Quest.

853
00:58:08,278 --> 00:58:09,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, space shooters.

854
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:10,760
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have any of those.

855
00:58:12,942 --> 00:58:13,563
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we need.

856
00:58:14,113 --> 00:58:16,414
[SPEAKER_03]: But wasn't there Galaxy Wars?

857
00:58:16,974 --> 00:58:17,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Geometry Wars?

858
00:58:18,515 --> 00:58:19,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I was being facetious.

859
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:23,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, and I was going... Hey, Rob.

860
00:58:23,817 --> 00:58:23,977
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

861
00:58:28,743 --> 00:58:37,308
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing that we don't have enough, or I'm sure we're not going to have enough pretty soon of, is games that are going to use the brand new balance board that's coming with Wii Fit.

862
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:42,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, fear not, because Take-Two has decided, hey, guess what?

863
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Don King's Prizefighter?

864
00:58:43,651 --> 00:58:44,771
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, bitches.

865
00:58:44,831 --> 00:58:46,932
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have balance board training games.

866
00:58:47,853 --> 00:58:48,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, boy.

867
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:56,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when you're done playing Wii Fit, you can get Wii Fit again with training games and the...

868
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:57,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

869
00:58:57,771 --> 00:59:08,921
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a boxing game that has a bunch of actually kind of almost rhythm games to it to train in but now you can use the Wii Fit balance board as well.

870
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:14,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when I think Don King I think Wii Fit DDR-ish type thing.

871
00:59:14,687 --> 00:59:16,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a boxing game, okay?

872
00:59:17,446 --> 00:59:17,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

873
00:59:18,006 --> 00:59:21,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll have like... Well, that might actually be kind of fun.

874
00:59:21,168 --> 00:59:24,569
[SPEAKER_08]: A game that combines like Wii Boxing with the Wii Fit board for balance.

875
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:26,830
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually could be kind of cool.

876
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:28,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Except this is the training portion.

877
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:32,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's going to actually have, you know... But here's the thing that I think would be pretty funny.

878
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:40,036
[SPEAKER_07]: They could use like a balance board mini game or something like that where you have to stay balanced on Don King's hair.

879
00:59:42,277 --> 00:59:43,317
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be challenging.

880
00:59:45,738 --> 00:59:46,859
[SPEAKER_08]: That would definitely be challenging.

881
00:59:47,182 --> 00:59:47,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

882
00:59:47,402 --> 00:59:47,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

883
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:15,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Quake 3 was my favorite in the series.

884
01:00:15,438 --> 01:00:20,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to knock betas or anything, and I love signing up for betas.

885
01:00:21,464 --> 01:00:36,877
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason, I don't play them once I sign up for them, so I guess I'm not really their prime beta candidate, but I really wish there was betas for things other than, I don't know, first-person shooters might be nice.

886
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:40,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that they do have the occasional beta for an MMO game, but you know.

887
01:00:42,529 --> 01:00:45,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't play MMOs anymore, but something else would be nice.

888
01:00:46,651 --> 01:00:47,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.

889
01:00:48,331 --> 01:00:50,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually the thing is, what are they trying to beta test?

890
01:00:50,412 --> 01:00:54,534
[SPEAKER_08]: They're trying to stress test their servers, so that's why it's always these type of MMOs.

891
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:55,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Animal Crossing?

892
01:00:56,955 --> 01:00:57,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be down with that.

893
01:00:57,895 --> 01:00:59,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Or a racing game?

894
01:00:59,936 --> 01:01:03,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I somehow doubt it, because Nintendo is kind of their own little box.

895
01:01:03,698 --> 01:01:04,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they do beta testing.

896
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:08,199
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't really care about the quality of their online anyway, so that's fine.

897
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, maybe a racing game or something.

898
01:01:11,221 --> 01:01:12,021
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be pretty cool.

899
01:01:13,042 --> 01:01:15,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't expect it to work perfectly because it is a beta.

900
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:24,131
[SPEAKER_08]: You can check that out again.

901
01:01:24,191 --> 01:01:27,554
[SPEAKER_08]: QuakeLive.com if you want to sign up for the Quake Live beta.

902
01:01:27,674 --> 01:01:29,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I just might because I do love Quake 3 that much.

903
01:01:30,075 --> 01:01:34,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the only FPSs I really played a whole lot of that I just enjoyed very much.

904
01:01:35,287 --> 01:01:48,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for any of our, I guess, listeners in Japan, because it's probably only coming out there, Squeenix has a new RPG for the mobile phones, and it's called Elark, E-L-L-A-R-K.

905
01:01:48,632 --> 01:01:58,215
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a free online RPG, though, and it will be launched in June for the three major Japanese characters, but it's...

906
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,869
[SPEAKER_03]: This style looks sort of Final Fantasy.

907
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:06,493
[SPEAKER_03]: The little bit of artwork I'm seeing is sort of Final Fantasy tactics-tastic.

908
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:08,875
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe.

909
01:02:10,937 --> 01:02:11,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it is free.

910
01:02:13,399 --> 01:02:16,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, how can you say free if you live somewhere else than here?

911
01:02:17,102 --> 01:02:17,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really?

912
01:02:17,482 --> 01:02:18,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Because our cell phones suck.

913
01:02:19,684 --> 01:02:21,166
[SPEAKER_08]: They only barely do TV.

914
01:02:22,607 --> 01:02:24,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Even Europe's kicking our butt in cell phones.

915
01:02:25,563 --> 01:02:31,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's one thing we aren't going to be free of anytime soon, and that is new Spider-Man games.

916
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:33,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Hoorah!

917
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:44,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Still trying to recapture their triumph of the PlayStation version of Spider-Man 2, probably one of the greatest Spider-Man games that they've made so far.

918
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:52,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man Friend or Foe weren't very good games.

919
01:02:53,706 --> 01:03:16,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Web of Shadows is a free roaming open-ended adventure that's going to be headed to all of the current consoles out there and handhelds and is being brought to you by Shaba Games and Treyarch.

920
01:03:17,739 --> 01:03:37,254
[SPEAKER_07]: and um didn't really say what the game's gonna revolve around but there's a lot of Venom looking you know stuff and they also said there's possibly other um Marvel Universe characters that you'll actually get to play as as well they hinted to that stuff so I don't know neat I guess but

921
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the last... I remember when Spider-Man games used to be good.

922
01:03:42,053 --> 01:03:43,814
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't trust the track record of Spider-Man games.

923
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:45,514
[SPEAKER_07]: The last few games have really sucked.

924
01:03:45,674 --> 01:03:48,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially, I mean, Spider-Man 3 where you'd sink into the grass.

925
01:03:49,596 --> 01:03:50,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Like quicksand.

926
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:51,136
[SPEAKER_07]: That's funny.

927
01:03:51,556 --> 01:03:53,197
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt kind of agrees with you.

928
01:03:53,237 --> 01:03:55,518
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, I'm a sucker for free-roam New York City games.

929
01:03:55,558 --> 01:03:56,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really hoping this game doesn't suck.

930
01:03:59,298 --> 01:03:59,778
[SPEAKER_08]: We shall see.

931
01:04:00,718 --> 01:04:02,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, our Skype line is just about open.

932
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:05,580
[SPEAKER_08]: We only have a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the Skype line before we end our program.

933
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,021
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number or our username on Skype.

934
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:10,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Get ready, Orange Lounge Radio.

935
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:13,002
[SPEAKER_08]: But first we have to do a quick follow-up.

936
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:22,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember last week we talked about that Famitsu was reporting or was saying that a new DS is very likely to be announced at the next E3.

937
01:04:22,904 --> 01:04:25,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Nintendo came right out and denied it.

938
01:04:26,425 --> 01:04:35,208
[SPEAKER_08]: They denied it and said, no, we are not making a new DS and we're not really revealing anything that we're going to be revealing at E3 until E3.

939
01:04:36,508 --> 01:04:50,413
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be noted, however, that a couple years ago, one day before it was announced, Nintendo denied having any knowledge about a DS Lite and then a day later the DS Lite was announced.

940
01:04:51,033 --> 01:05:04,538
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, you can always take Nintendo denials with a grain of salt, but at the same time, the original news has a bit of a grain of salt as well, because it's probably based simply off the fact that, gee, Nintendo likes to redo their consoles all the time.

941
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:14,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, was it the publisher of Famitsu was the one originally quoting that it was going to be announced at E3, and then they retracted that statement, too.

942
01:05:15,923 --> 01:05:18,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is interesting.

943
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:18,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

944
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:19,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

945
01:05:19,971 --> 01:05:20,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wait for E3.

946
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,093
[SPEAKER_07]: What, is it a few months away?

947
01:05:23,054 --> 01:05:23,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

948
01:05:24,054 --> 01:05:24,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

949
01:05:25,035 --> 01:05:27,017
[SPEAKER_08]: One more story, then the Skype line is open.

950
01:05:27,437 --> 01:05:30,240
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, our final official story for the evening.

951
01:05:32,422 --> 01:05:42,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is going to be some good news for Mass Effect PC players and that is the actually free content.

952
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:44,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Free content is nice, isn't it?

953
01:05:44,412 --> 01:05:44,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, free!

954
01:05:46,705 --> 01:05:53,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but that's the, um, Bring Down the Sky is going to be free for anyone who's interested in it.

955
01:05:53,608 --> 01:05:56,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it bad that I didn't even realize Mass Effect was on PC?

956
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:59,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I thought it was an Xbox 360 only game for some reason.

957
01:06:01,052 --> 01:06:02,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just, I'm just out of it, I guess.

958
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:06,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, well, they had to pay for it on Xbox Live for five bucks.

959
01:06:06,654 --> 01:06:08,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but that's kind of cool that they gave it for free on PC.

960
01:06:09,155 --> 01:06:09,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

961
01:06:09,516 --> 01:06:11,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they just couldn't think of a way to charge for it.

962
01:06:12,437 --> 01:06:13,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in pieces of their soul.

963
01:06:14,198 --> 01:06:14,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

964
01:06:15,549 --> 01:06:15,969
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

965
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:24,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's also free for you to call in and interact with us on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

966
01:06:24,594 --> 01:06:28,056
[SPEAKER_08]: And once you know it, we're already getting hammered with phone calls, so let's open up the lines.

967
01:06:28,136 --> 01:06:29,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

968
01:06:29,977 --> 01:06:30,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

969
01:06:31,078 --> 01:06:32,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma from New York.

970
01:06:33,419 --> 01:06:34,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma from New York.

971
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:38,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you like the free roaming New York City games as well, like SSJ 100, Matt?

972
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:40,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I just heard about it myself.

973
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:45,993
[SPEAKER_08]: What about Grand Theft Auto and all these types of other games that are parodying New York?

974
01:06:46,013 --> 01:06:47,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you like seeing parodies of your home city?

975
01:06:48,594 --> 01:06:49,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I'm all for it.

976
01:06:49,855 --> 01:06:51,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what did you call in to talk to us about tonight?

977
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:54,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, before I begin, Jamie, happy birthday.

978
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:55,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

979
01:06:56,538 --> 01:06:57,279
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

980
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:00,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give you a brief talk about New York Comic Con.

981
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:04,823
[SPEAKER_06]: First thing, there was no John Woo talking about the Metroid Prime movie.

982
01:07:05,327 --> 01:07:06,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Iron Man Movie Maybe next year

983
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:37,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it'll be pretty awesome though.

984
01:07:37,847 --> 01:07:40,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But overall, the con itself was fun.

985
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:45,112
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it was on the higher level of the Jabba Center where it was actually spread out.

986
01:07:45,132 --> 01:07:47,093
[SPEAKER_06]: We could actually walk around and breathe.

987
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:49,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

988
01:07:50,496 --> 01:07:56,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was a lot of people there, a lot of webcomic artists that were there.

989
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:01,603
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, Jamie, I did send you a picture, so... I like the picture.

990
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:01,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

991
01:08:02,847 --> 01:08:03,428
[SPEAKER_06]: VG Cats

992
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:34,391
[SPEAKER_08]: So you actually got the guy who draws VG Cats to draw a picture of Jamie.

993
01:08:34,631 --> 01:08:35,753
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cute!

994
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:38,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he showed it to me before the show.

995
01:08:38,696 --> 01:08:40,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that's so cute!

996
01:08:41,339 --> 01:08:42,220
[SPEAKER_08]: So, very cool!

997
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:42,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

998
01:08:43,143 --> 01:08:44,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Why couldn't you get the rest of us, huh?

999
01:08:44,604 --> 01:08:45,804
[SPEAKER_08]: We gotta wait for our... No, I'm just kidding.

1000
01:08:45,844 --> 01:08:46,805
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think that's great.

1001
01:08:47,185 --> 01:08:49,806
[SPEAKER_03]: VGCast is like my favorite webcomic right now.

1002
01:08:49,966 --> 01:08:50,786
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you know what's funny?

1003
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,747
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually calls... I know how she says right now.

1004
01:08:54,128 --> 01:08:54,748
[SPEAKER_08]: But it might change.

1005
01:08:55,028 --> 01:08:55,828
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been for a while.

1006
01:08:55,888 --> 01:08:58,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Depending on what bribes other webcomics send her.

1007
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:02,551
[SPEAKER_08]: He called me, I guess like Friday, I think he called me.

1008
01:09:02,551 --> 01:09:03,391
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got the picture from us at E3.

1009
01:09:03,411 --> 01:09:04,452
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't me that got the picture.

1010
01:09:04,472 --> 01:09:05,513
[SPEAKER_08]: You can thank Gio Dia.

1011
01:09:05,533 --> 01:09:07,173
[SPEAKER_08]: She picked out the picture for me to take over there.

1012
01:09:07,193 --> 01:09:07,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1013
01:09:07,293 --> 01:09:07,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there you have it.

1014
01:09:07,914 --> 01:09:09,114
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is the guy who does VG Cats, Drew Jamie.

1015
01:09:09,134 --> 01:09:09,415
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

1016
01:09:09,475 --> 01:09:09,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

1017
01:09:32,691 --> 01:09:33,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

1018
01:09:33,251 --> 01:09:34,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's so cool.

1019
01:09:34,092 --> 01:09:36,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to write a thank you too.

1020
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:38,014
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you so much.

1021
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:38,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

1022
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:40,155
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the best thing ever.

1023
01:09:40,195 --> 01:09:42,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we should just invite him on the damn show.

1024
01:09:42,296 --> 01:09:42,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to.

1025
01:09:43,296 --> 01:09:44,937
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a website of the week once.

1026
01:09:44,977 --> 01:09:45,277
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go.

1027
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:45,677
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1028
01:09:45,697 --> 01:09:46,358
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll work on that.

1029
01:09:47,178 --> 01:09:47,518
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get it.

1030
01:09:47,738 --> 01:09:48,679
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll work it out.

1031
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:50,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Ranma, thank you so much.

1032
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,500
[SPEAKER_08]: That was very nice of you to do.

1033
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And the whole chat room is fawning over it right now.

1034
01:09:54,001 --> 01:09:54,482
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1035
01:09:55,506 --> 01:09:58,267
[SPEAKER_06]: You notice how it just looks like Jamie if you think about it?

1036
01:09:58,287 --> 01:10:00,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Just her normal attitude per se.

1037
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:01,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's cool.

1038
01:10:01,968 --> 01:10:05,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Except now I'm going to make her wear cat ears just to compare.

1039
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:06,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I have several cat-eared hats.

1040
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:07,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Rob.

1041
01:10:09,511 --> 01:10:09,791
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1042
01:10:10,091 --> 01:10:13,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to share with our chatters today, Rama, and our listeners?

1043
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's pretty much it.

1044
01:10:15,133 --> 01:10:16,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to get that across.

1045
01:10:16,854 --> 01:10:17,274
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.

1046
01:10:18,356 --> 01:10:19,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you very much.

1047
01:10:19,157 --> 01:10:19,837
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate it.

1048
01:10:19,977 --> 01:10:21,178
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

1049
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:21,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Anytime.

1050
01:10:22,559 --> 01:10:24,620
[SPEAKER_08]: You make Jamie's birthday last all weekend long.

1051
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure she can't complain.

1052
01:10:26,641 --> 01:10:26,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1053
01:10:26,942 --> 01:10:27,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and Jamie?

1054
01:10:29,203 --> 01:10:31,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Gio wants to know, where did you get the gelato from?

1055
01:10:32,045 --> 01:10:33,226
[SPEAKER_06]: The Guinness gelato?

1056
01:10:33,466 --> 01:10:33,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Naya.

1057
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:35,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1058
01:10:36,928 --> 01:10:41,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only seen Naya in California, so I don't know if it's all over the place.

1059
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,210
[SPEAKER_03]: They have different flavors that circulate.

1060
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,671
[SPEAKER_03]: They also had champagne gelato.

1061
01:10:48,171 --> 01:10:54,973
[SPEAKER_03]: They also had mojito and Captain Morgan gelato.

1062
01:10:54,993 --> 01:10:55,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1063
01:10:56,162 --> 01:10:56,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that one.

1064
01:10:57,303 --> 01:10:59,284
[SPEAKER_03]: The Guinness gelato is freaking good.

1065
01:11:00,224 --> 01:11:06,708
[SPEAKER_03]: They usually have Nutella, but if ever you find Anaya and they have whole wheat gelato, try it.

1066
01:11:06,748 --> 01:11:07,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes like cereal.

1067
01:11:10,269 --> 01:11:12,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda in chat says they're Bay Area.

1068
01:11:12,591 --> 01:11:13,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they only have six stores.

1069
01:11:14,051 --> 01:11:15,872
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's the Amanda I'm thinking it is, then hi.

1070
01:11:17,053 --> 01:11:19,294
[SPEAKER_08]: They're Bay Area only.

1071
01:11:19,954 --> 01:11:21,095
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really good though.

1072
01:11:21,175 --> 01:11:22,476
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Pinkberry, I'm sorry.

1073
01:11:22,496 --> 01:11:24,017
[SPEAKER_08]: We just got...

1074
01:11:25,785 --> 01:11:26,886
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to let you go, Ranma.

1075
01:11:26,926 --> 01:11:27,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

1076
01:11:27,526 --> 01:11:27,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try.

1077
01:11:28,267 --> 01:11:28,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1078
01:11:28,787 --> 01:11:29,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll catch up to you guys later.

1079
01:11:29,888 --> 01:11:32,090
[SPEAKER_08]: 1877 Game.

1080
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:32,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dang.

1081
01:11:33,852 --> 01:11:35,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hung up and boop, here comes another call.

1082
01:11:36,274 --> 01:11:37,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1083
01:11:37,535 --> 01:11:37,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1084
01:11:38,796 --> 01:11:39,476
[SPEAKER_08]: GS68.

1085
01:11:39,676 --> 01:11:40,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, GS68.

1086
01:11:40,457 --> 01:11:41,077
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1087
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:45,570
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'm happy 428 to everyone who celebrates it.

1088
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:47,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy 420, dude!

1089
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's our Zaku call?

1090
01:11:49,631 --> 01:11:50,971
[SPEAKER_08]: You know we need a Zaku call on 420.

1091
01:11:51,231 --> 01:11:52,191
[SPEAKER_08]: He's celebrating.

1092
01:11:52,251 --> 01:11:54,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what's up, GS68?

1093
01:11:55,132 --> 01:12:09,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, this week was the one-year anniversary of the VT Massacre, and I just want to say one thing to everyone who pinned the blame on video games, especially people who didn't even have any resources.

1094
01:12:10,345 --> 01:12:14,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Any resources or citations for that?

1095
01:12:14,546 --> 01:12:15,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Such as Lord Voldemort?

1096
01:12:16,546 --> 01:12:16,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1097
01:12:17,327 --> 01:12:26,128
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, why didn't he go up to the killers, the family, and say all that to their faces?

1098
01:12:28,349 --> 01:12:28,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I dare you.

1099
01:12:29,089 --> 01:12:37,471
[SPEAKER_00]: I dare you to go up to his parents, his siblings, if he has any, their faces, and

1100
01:12:38,453 --> 01:12:41,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Start talking about how his son was influenced by video games and all that.

1101
01:12:42,594 --> 01:13:00,979
[SPEAKER_08]: At the same time, though, I think this whole week of memory and everything is sort of to just kind of... I think we have to kind of let those bitter feelings just kind of go right now and try to look back and just kind of remember those that lost their lives and what was just a senseless and horrible thing and tragedy.

1102
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:05,020
[SPEAKER_08]: So at the same time, it's kind of like, let's just not draw the pain out any longer.

1103
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:05,540
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1104
01:13:07,501 --> 01:13:07,641
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1105
01:13:09,403 --> 01:13:10,584
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I understand.

1106
01:13:10,624 --> 01:13:14,226
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of stupid for some of those people to be blaming video games in the first place.

1107
01:13:14,346 --> 01:13:19,510
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just kind of sad that it keeps going on throughout all these tragic events that happened.

1108
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,071
[SPEAKER_08]: And the call dropped.

1109
01:13:21,131 --> 01:13:21,711
[SPEAKER_08]: We lost them.

1110
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:22,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that bandwidth?

1111
01:13:23,192 --> 01:13:24,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the network still going?

1112
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:25,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still on.

1113
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:26,674
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1114
01:13:26,714 --> 01:13:27,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we lost them.

1115
01:13:28,596 --> 01:13:31,878
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, and, of course, you know what's interesting?

1116
01:13:31,898 --> 01:13:34,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a friend that's actually going to be going to Virginia Tech next year.

1117
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I'm just – I'm –

1118
01:13:39,398 --> 01:13:40,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is probably a difficult time.

1119
01:13:40,559 --> 01:13:43,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we have listeners out there too, so I know it was probably a difficult week.

1120
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:46,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Our thoughts are with you guys.

1121
01:13:46,862 --> 01:13:48,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely, let's just try and get past it.

1122
01:13:51,224 --> 01:13:55,747
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1123
01:13:56,507 --> 01:14:00,209
[SPEAKER_08]: While we wait for some calls to drop in, do we have any quick last minute stories by chance?

1124
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:01,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything last minute?

1125
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:02,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?

1126
01:14:03,145 --> 01:14:04,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what would you like to share?

1127
01:14:06,551 --> 01:14:07,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to suggest...

1128
01:14:09,921 --> 01:14:17,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Blitz League was one of the games that they announced at Midway's Gamers Day that's getting a sequel, same as Game Party.

1129
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:20,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently both of those games are getting sequels.

1130
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:21,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Party?

1131
01:14:21,688 --> 01:14:22,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Party.

1132
01:14:22,308 --> 01:14:26,191
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the one that had beer pong in it, but they called it something else, Pink Cup.

1133
01:14:27,271 --> 01:14:29,433
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they were calling it instead of beer pong.

1134
01:14:29,753 --> 01:14:30,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we got another call.

1135
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:31,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go take it real quick.

1136
01:14:32,374 --> 01:14:33,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious to know more about this, though.

1137
01:14:33,655 --> 01:14:34,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1138
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:34,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1139
01:14:36,155 --> 01:14:37,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, this is RawSteelUT.

1140
01:14:38,075 --> 01:14:39,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, RawSteelUT.

1141
01:14:39,196 --> 01:14:40,136
[SPEAKER_08]: What is on your mind?

1142
01:14:41,796 --> 01:14:42,256
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit.

1143
01:14:42,316 --> 01:14:47,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I go into that, I would like to thank DMN for being an asshole and a grief friend banning me from the chat.

1144
01:14:47,697 --> 01:14:50,058
[SPEAKER_11]: That leaves me with time to play games while I'm listening.

1145
01:14:50,478 --> 01:14:51,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice.

1146
01:14:52,538 --> 01:14:53,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even going to go there.

1147
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:55,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the heck's going on.

1148
01:14:55,939 --> 01:15:00,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes I feel not in control of our own chat room, but we'll try to get that sorted out.

1149
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,180
[SPEAKER_08]: What else is on your mind, though, buddy?

1150
01:15:03,581 --> 01:15:05,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you saw this, but

1151
01:15:06,078 --> 01:15:12,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Recently, Vivendi had a really creative promotion for their upcoming Ghostbusters game.

1152
01:15:15,081 --> 01:15:19,562
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually restored the old Ectomobile, you know the car from the movie?

1153
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:27,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And they parked it at a Best Buy in Minnesota for promotional purposes.

1154
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:33,427
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually have a picture on Kotaku I'd link to the chat, but you know.

1155
01:15:34,427 --> 01:15:34,647
[SPEAKER_11]: And it

1156
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:36,650
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they did a bang-up job on it.

1157
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,470
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very nice.

1158
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:45,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see the car, but I saw the box art for the game, which I found to be half appropriate and half boring.

1159
01:15:45,554 --> 01:15:46,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see the box art that was posted?

1160
01:15:46,735 --> 01:15:47,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's just temporary.

1161
01:15:47,996 --> 01:15:50,597
[SPEAKER_08]: You think it's just one of those placeholder things for people who want to pre-order the game?

1162
01:15:50,637 --> 01:15:52,858
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a ways off before the game comes out.

1163
01:15:53,098 --> 01:15:59,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have just expected to see some more brouhaha about, because isn't the script actually by Bill Murray and them?

1164
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:01,465
[SPEAKER_08]: The script for the game is by the people who did the movie.

1165
01:16:01,525 --> 01:16:04,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, not Bill Murray, but like Harold Ramis and the people that did the original.

1166
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I would expect more fanfare over that.

1167
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:15,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, like you said, I think they want to keep to the feel of the original.

1168
01:16:16,136 --> 01:16:21,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember the original VHS covers had just the logo, which, you know...

1169
01:16:22,502 --> 01:16:24,343
[SPEAKER_11]: That was 20 years ago.

1170
01:16:25,324 --> 01:16:26,705
[SPEAKER_08]: That was 20 years ago.

1171
01:16:26,765 --> 01:16:27,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Things were different back then.

1172
01:16:27,766 --> 01:16:32,329
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

1173
01:16:32,549 --> 01:16:33,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's true.

1174
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:39,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you that, but that huge old Xbox 360 banner in white kind of ruins it.

1175
01:16:39,874 --> 01:16:40,415
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1176
01:16:40,435 --> 01:16:41,495
[SPEAKER_08]: And same thing with the PlayStation.

1177
01:16:41,676 --> 01:16:43,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, at least the PlayStation 3 thing is black.

1178
01:16:43,517 --> 01:16:44,378
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what I mean?

1179
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:48,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Those mandatory banners they have to have on there kind of ruin that all black box.

1180
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:48,921
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1181
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:59,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that's honestly what it is for me, is that having those other little streaks in it ruin the thing.

1182
01:16:59,485 --> 01:17:01,587
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, it's just box art, I'll get over it.

1183
01:17:01,667 --> 01:17:03,368
[SPEAKER_08]: If the game's good, you can look past it.

1184
01:17:03,468 --> 01:17:11,114
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about you, I throw the boxes away because I have like hundreds of games and I really don't have the space for all those big-ass boxes.

1185
01:17:11,214 --> 01:17:11,855
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I just...

1186
01:17:12,856 --> 01:17:14,398
[SPEAKER_11]: I just put them in jewel cases myself.

1187
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:15,719
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what you guys do.

1188
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:18,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I do leave them in the case, but the cases are all on a shelf.

1189
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:20,383
[SPEAKER_08]: They're on a DVD rack type thing that's pretty big.

1190
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:23,806
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have my Wii games on one rack, Xbox 360 on another rack.

1191
01:17:23,866 --> 01:17:25,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So it works.

1192
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:29,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't own as many games as one might think.

1193
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:36,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly don't own as many games as Jamie does, who has to have an entire wall in her house with nothing but bookshelves that have the games.

1194
01:17:37,078 --> 01:18:02,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you what we do is that for the systems that we have out most often being our Xbox 360, the Wii, and the PS3 and the Saturn is out right now too I think what we do is we usually keep out the games that we're playing the most and we have a small rack that stays in the front room and we've got actually these large bookshelves in the computer room that's basically also my room because I'm on the computer in there

1195
01:18:03,197 --> 01:18:05,938
[SPEAKER_03]: but we keep them with our movies, with our DVDs.

1196
01:18:06,058 --> 01:18:14,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And the special edition boxes, we will every so often have them on display for the newer ones but right now they're all in the vault.

1197
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,800
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't make gaming organizers quite like they used to either.

1198
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:27,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a pretty badass one for the Atari 2600 that was like a little drawer and you'd hit the button and the drawer would pop out and then you'd hit another button and the game would kind of pop out.

1199
01:18:27,622 --> 01:18:31,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean it was just cheap plastic with levers but the way it worked was pretty awesome.

1200
01:18:35,412 --> 01:18:42,775
[SPEAKER_03]: The Atari 5200 had its little storage compartment in the back for controllers and a couple of games built into the system.

1201
01:18:44,056 --> 01:18:48,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Nintendo actually had something similar to that for the Super Nintendo, for the N64.

1202
01:18:48,798 --> 01:18:49,478
[SPEAKER_11]: They had like these...

1203
01:18:50,276 --> 01:18:50,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Game Houses.

1204
01:18:50,996 --> 01:18:51,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a couple of them.

1205
01:18:51,597 --> 01:18:52,197
[SPEAKER_11]: They're very nice.

1206
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:54,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember that.

1207
01:18:55,099 --> 01:18:55,599
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

1208
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what do we get?

1209
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:03,623
[SPEAKER_08]: We get a Wii thing that was supposed to have a chip holder in it that ends up getting cancelled.

1210
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:05,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I derailed your original topic of the Ghostbusters thing.

1211
01:19:05,805 --> 01:19:08,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything else you wanted to say on that or anything else you wanted to talk about tonight?

1212
01:19:09,947 --> 01:19:10,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no.

1213
01:19:10,427 --> 01:19:11,448
[SPEAKER_11]: That was just about it.

1214
01:19:11,508 --> 01:19:12,949
[SPEAKER_11]: That was just about it, yeah.

1215
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:14,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Except that people...

1216
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:21,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Astro, that's about it.

1217
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:24,144
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll take too much to bring up something else.

1218
01:19:24,224 --> 01:19:25,504
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do that in the email next week.

1219
01:19:25,724 --> 01:19:27,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, it was good to talk to you guys.

1220
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:29,466
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always best to take the high road, Rusty.

1221
01:19:29,546 --> 01:19:30,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

1222
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one, bro.

1223
01:19:32,107 --> 01:19:34,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

1224
01:19:34,688 --> 01:19:38,350
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1225
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:40,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we gotta take at least one more call.

1226
01:19:40,451 --> 01:19:41,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1227
01:19:41,731 --> 01:19:42,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1228
01:19:43,192 --> 01:19:43,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Legend of Zaku.

1229
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:44,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy 420, Legend of Zaku!

1230
01:19:47,972 --> 01:19:53,517
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't smoke weed for the record, I just said it to all the people that celebrate the consumption of cannabis.

1231
01:19:53,797 --> 01:20:05,767
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I gotta give you a hard time, Zaku, because you gotta admit, I don't know if it's just your microphone or the environment you call us in, if you're calling us from a tin can or something, but Tin can?

1232
01:20:05,847 --> 01:20:08,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's the string, though?

1233
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,111
[SPEAKER_08]: You always sound a little bit high, but that's alright.

1234
01:20:10,932 --> 01:20:13,334
[SPEAKER_08]: We're equal opportunity entertainers here at Orange Lingerie.

1235
01:20:13,634 --> 01:20:15,376
[SPEAKER_08]: To what do we owe this great phone call tonight?

1236
01:20:16,506 --> 01:20:44,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, let me see, uh, alright, basically, it's like this, uh, we, recently, as of, you know, as of last Friday, I took this girl out on, you know, went out with this girl, and we happened to stop by Dave & Buster's on our date, um, and I was just wondering, I know I don't want to dig up DDR as much, but, suppose you had, suppose that the date of yours basically never played DDR, and if she did, it was really horrible.

1237
01:20:45,182 --> 01:20:49,827
[SPEAKER_12]: What songs would you even recommend in order for both of us to play?

1238
01:20:50,128 --> 01:20:56,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say fuck it and take her over to Jumpin' Jackpot because that's where you're really going to get some pussy is Jumpin' Jackpot.

1239
01:20:57,796 --> 01:20:58,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

1240
01:21:00,019 --> 01:21:01,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you agree, DarkSakura?

1241
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:03,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

1242
01:21:03,643 --> 01:21:06,086
[SPEAKER_08]: What turns you on more, DDR or Jumpin' Jackpot?

1243
01:21:07,383 --> 01:21:07,883
[SPEAKER_03]: D.D.R.

1244
01:21:23,151 --> 01:21:28,434
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, she can't really use both of her legs, both of her feet effectively.

1245
01:21:28,654 --> 01:21:33,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Two guaranteed ways to get somebody who's not into DDR, girl, boy, or not.

1246
01:21:34,176 --> 01:21:39,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Two guaranteed ways to get them into it is that A, you pick easy songs, one foot songs.

1247
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:40,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

1248
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:42,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I had her on beginner.

1249
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,321
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, good, good.

1250
01:21:43,341 --> 01:21:43,921
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where you got to start.

1251
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:44,121
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1252
01:21:44,321 --> 01:21:45,042
[SPEAKER_08]: It was on a Supernova too.

1253
01:22:03,432 --> 01:22:27,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about the rest of you guys but one thing I remember about my very first game of DDR I ever played on a DDR 1.5 mix that song Butterfly was damn catchy and that song was in my head for like three days after playing DDR I was just kind of going around going I'm your little butterfly I'm your little butterfly

1254
01:22:28,092 --> 01:22:29,852
[SPEAKER_08]: and I could not get that freaking song out of my head.

1255
01:22:29,913 --> 01:22:32,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's okay to pick catchy stuff.

1256
01:22:32,273 --> 01:22:38,495
[SPEAKER_08]: But you've got to kind of know, if she's kind of a rocker girl, SmileDK is not going to be your thing.

1257
01:22:38,835 --> 01:22:41,876
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if DDR necessarily will be.

1258
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:44,176
[SPEAKER_12]: As I said, I was totally unprepared for the situation.

1259
01:22:44,656 --> 01:22:45,897
[SPEAKER_08]: You just let her pick the song.

1260
01:22:46,797 --> 01:22:47,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's the thing.

1261
01:22:47,997 --> 01:22:50,478
[SPEAKER_12]: She said she didn't care.

1262
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:53,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Typical woman response.

1263
01:22:54,558 --> 01:22:55,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care but I will

1264
01:23:15,197 --> 01:23:19,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It either means that, no, she really doesn't care, but once she hears it, she's probably not going to like it.

1265
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:26,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just say, pick one, pick the other, and ask her which one sounds better.

1266
01:23:28,364 --> 01:23:29,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't leave it open.

1267
01:23:29,965 --> 01:23:33,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I kind of, as I said, I kind of needed that advice.

1268
01:23:33,347 --> 01:23:35,808
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it was a quick spur-of-the-moment thing.

1269
01:23:37,489 --> 01:23:41,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully I'll try it again if I, you know, once I go out with her again.

1270
01:23:42,307 --> 01:23:50,856
[SPEAKER_08]: My buddy Amanda in chat says, reminds me, and she's an official woman too, she says, the way Rob got me to play it was, quote, Amanda, it's like a rave, but a game.

1271
01:23:50,876 --> 01:23:52,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Because she was a big raver back then.

1272
01:23:53,118 --> 01:23:54,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, it's like a rave, but a game.

1273
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's flashing lights.

1274
01:23:57,162 --> 01:23:59,724
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like cross-stitching, but a game.

1275
01:24:01,246 --> 01:24:05,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Zaku, best of luck to you on future dates, and we hope you get some, all right?

1276
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:05,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

1277
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:06,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1278
01:24:06,711 --> 01:24:06,991
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1279
01:24:08,192 --> 01:24:08,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, buddy.

1280
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:10,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear that, yeah?

1281
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:12,356
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of like, yeah, me too.

1282
01:24:14,838 --> 01:24:16,619
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1283
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:22,084
[SPEAKER_08]: If you missed us tonight, sorry, maybe you can leave us a voicemail on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1284
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:23,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget about our contest going on, too.

1285
01:24:23,686 --> 01:24:25,928
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to check that out as we are –

1286
01:24:27,304 --> 01:24:29,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Go on throughout the week and looking for contest entries.

1287
01:24:30,325 --> 01:24:32,186
[SPEAKER_08]: So, more last-minute stories from Loki.

1288
01:24:32,226 --> 01:24:35,467
[SPEAKER_08]: We had the story about Blitz the League and Beer Pong getting a sequel.

1289
01:24:35,747 --> 01:24:36,688
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Beer Pong.

1290
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:39,009
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game called... But that's the part we care about.

1291
01:24:39,029 --> 01:24:44,731
[SPEAKER_07]: ...Game Party, and it had Beer Pong in it and Shuffleboard and some other shit.

1292
01:24:45,511 --> 01:24:46,352
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a cheap-ass game.

1293
01:24:47,212 --> 01:24:49,433
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those maybe shovelware games or whatever.

1294
01:24:49,933 --> 01:25:07,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, real quick, the Burnout Paradise Cagney update that was going to be coming out, actually, from what I read now, it's out now, so if you pop in your copy of Burnout, you'll get your new portions of the map, which I will have to try when I get home.

1295
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:11,832
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's also going to include three more online modes.

1296
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:16,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Road Rage, Markman, and Stunt Run are going to be available online as well now.

1297
01:25:17,037 --> 01:25:21,441
[SPEAKER_07]: For PS3 owners, you will also be getting the option for custom soundtracks.

1298
01:25:22,602 --> 01:25:23,363
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty nice.

1299
01:25:24,964 --> 01:25:38,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Something kind of disappointing, that game Boom Blocks, that was supposedly going to have that head tracking kind of easter egg, well, they removed head tracking, so no reason to buy that game now.

1300
01:25:40,558 --> 01:25:44,082
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, you can't yell, get out of my head to this video game anymore.

1301
01:25:44,523 --> 01:25:44,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

1302
01:25:46,105 --> 01:25:46,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1303
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:50,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, an Xbox 360 power supply was blamed for a fire.

1304
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:51,371
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of funny.

1305
01:25:52,692 --> 01:25:54,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox Live is going to be down tomorrow.

1306
01:25:54,414 --> 01:25:56,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Not if it's your house that burned down.

1307
01:25:56,075 --> 01:25:56,755
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not funny.

1308
01:25:56,855 --> 01:25:58,176
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't, so it's funny.

1309
01:25:59,356 --> 01:26:09,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox Live is going to be down tomorrow from 2, or I guess tonight, 2 in the morning to 10 tomorrow, Pacific time, just for some spring cleaning maintenance.

1310
01:26:12,422 --> 01:26:13,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1311
01:26:14,543 --> 01:26:17,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, there's some interesting things.

1312
01:26:19,232 --> 01:26:23,215
[SPEAKER_07]: You might know this guy, Ricky Gervais, I guess.

1313
01:26:24,696 --> 01:26:25,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Gervais, yes.

1314
01:26:26,358 --> 01:26:29,760
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the guy that's in The Office in the UK.

1315
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:38,727
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually going to be kind of having a cameo in Grand Theft Auto 4 as part of, I guess, the city's stand-up comedy club.

1316
01:26:38,787 --> 01:26:40,708
[SPEAKER_07]: He has a three-minute act that will...

1317
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:43,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Loop or whatever.

1318
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:45,373
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll have different people going on stage.

1319
01:26:45,393 --> 01:26:48,977
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that's kind of cool that they have real comedians doing acts in the game.

1320
01:26:49,798 --> 01:26:51,861
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of immersion there.

1321
01:26:54,003 --> 01:26:54,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1322
01:26:56,706 --> 01:26:57,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Also...

1323
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:02,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Halo Wars is coming along pretty well.

1324
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:12,496
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a few people that are part of the Xbox 360 launch team that have been caught playing Halo Wars Alpha online.

1325
01:27:13,256 --> 01:27:15,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Saw you, caught you.

1326
01:27:15,778 --> 01:27:17,119
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's interesting.

1327
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:20,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1328
01:27:23,768 --> 01:27:25,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I may have talked about this before.

1329
01:27:26,391 --> 01:27:27,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Virtual console games.

1330
01:27:27,593 --> 01:27:29,515
[SPEAKER_07]: People have found ways to pirate those now.

1331
01:27:30,316 --> 01:27:31,437
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of interesting.

1332
01:27:32,909 --> 01:27:41,854
[SPEAKER_07]: They found ways to strip away all of the encryption on them, and now a team called Blaze is releasing them out on the internet right now.

1333
01:27:41,874 --> 01:27:52,761
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a few of them, and using a tool put out by yet someone else, you can actually install them to your system using the Twilight Princess hack.

1334
01:27:53,741 --> 01:27:57,883
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's... I guess no one's perfect as far as security goes.

1335
01:27:58,944 --> 01:28:09,090
[SPEAKER_07]: What's interesting, though, also is that the UK version of the internet channel has also been leaked out using that method as well.

1336
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:11,992
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means that WiiWare isn't immune to it either.

1337
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:13,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.

1338
01:28:14,293 --> 01:28:15,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh!

1339
01:28:15,133 --> 01:28:15,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1340
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:21,866
[SPEAKER_08]: But if Nintendo catches you, you will get the wrath upon you.

1341
01:28:22,126 --> 01:28:22,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1342
01:28:23,027 --> 01:28:25,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently there's no plans for Gears of War 2.

1343
01:28:25,711 --> 01:28:29,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say, that's the problem with posting these methods on the internet is that Nintendo will patch it.

1344
01:28:30,373 --> 01:28:31,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1345
01:28:31,713 --> 01:28:35,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently there's not going to be a Gears of War 2 demo.

1346
01:28:35,434 --> 01:28:48,857
[SPEAKER_07]: However, there have been some hints, Mark Rain, I guess, dropping some hints that Unreal Tournament 3 will feature the first Gears of War 2 content tease.

1347
01:28:49,278 --> 01:28:54,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't say what it is, but he says, we know some of these great mods are going to be...

1348
01:28:55,359 --> 01:29:23,426
[SPEAKER_07]: or they're talking about the mods those are also going to be out available for the Xbox 360 version of Unreal Tournament 3 but people are thinking maybe that they're going to have either a demo on Unreal Tournament 3 or there's just going to be some new video footage of the game so I guess that's pretty cool and let's see here I think that's pretty much it oh

1349
01:29:24,168 --> 01:29:49,755
[SPEAKER_07]: there's been a lot of homebrew stuff made for the Wii as well including now they have SNES emulators with classic controller support Genesis Sega CD emulators Master System Game Gear emulators for the Wii PC Engine emulators they have the Rin Game Boy channel for the Wii EmuLoader which will do some other emulators and Wii Paint which might be fun they need a Mario Paint for the Wii that'd be fun

1350
01:29:51,388 --> 01:29:51,688
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1351
01:29:52,449 --> 01:29:53,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Wowies, lots of last minute news.

1352
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:58,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking going into this week after I'd been gone, I was like, oh, it's a slow gaming week, but no, lots of news.

1353
01:29:59,455 --> 01:30:00,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of good stuff.

1354
01:30:00,936 --> 01:30:05,740
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio, but not before we get everybody's final thoughts.

1355
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Sakura, your final thought.

1356
01:30:07,881 --> 01:30:08,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have ordered this earlier.

1357
01:30:09,462 --> 01:30:09,843
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?

1358
01:30:11,064 --> 01:30:12,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Tickets for Phantom of the Opera.

1359
01:30:12,705 --> 01:30:13,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nice.

1360
01:30:14,406 --> 01:30:14,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go.

1361
01:30:14,987 --> 01:30:15,527
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like fun.

1362
01:30:15,828 --> 01:30:16,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you're...

1363
01:30:18,644 --> 01:30:19,905
[SPEAKER_08]: If I go, I have to take my mother.

1364
01:30:20,245 --> 01:30:24,868
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to sound so gay, but I don't care.

1365
01:30:24,928 --> 01:30:30,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to a musical theater is something I have to do with my mom because she's such a fan.

1366
01:30:30,311 --> 01:30:32,273
[SPEAKER_08]: When Mama Mia comes to town, she's like, we gotta go!

1367
01:30:33,133 --> 01:30:33,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought.

1368
01:30:34,114 --> 01:30:39,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not be seeing Phantom this year since I've seen it the last two times it's been in town, and I really don't need to see it a third time.

1369
01:30:40,437 --> 01:30:45,060
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is Sweeney Todd is going to be in town this year, and that's one I want to see.

1370
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,301
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's probably the one I'll buy my mom tickets for.

1371
01:30:47,321 --> 01:30:47,982
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be cool.

1372
01:30:48,022 --> 01:30:52,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if I'm going to go to musical theater, I'm going to take her to a violent play and see what she thinks of that.

1373
01:30:54,045 --> 01:30:56,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your mom, and we need to call her on the show.

1374
01:30:57,267 --> 01:30:58,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Mother's Day is just around the corner.

1375
01:30:59,065 --> 01:31:03,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, we need to figure out what we're going to do for our Justin TV deal.

1376
01:31:03,928 --> 01:31:04,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1377
01:31:04,669 --> 01:31:07,531
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a Justin TV special thingy in the works.

1378
01:31:08,111 --> 01:31:09,632
[SPEAKER_08]: More OLR programming coming.

1379
01:31:10,412 --> 01:31:11,373
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about it this week.

1380
01:31:11,673 --> 01:31:16,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I like asking questions like that because it teases it and makes the chat room go, WTF?

1381
01:31:17,037 --> 01:31:17,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Must listen!

1382
01:31:17,937 --> 01:31:18,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Or watch.

1383
01:31:18,518 --> 01:31:18,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Or stuff.

1384
01:31:19,326 --> 01:31:20,167
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1385
01:31:39,218 --> 01:31:43,120
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we don't ask for your cash, but we do ask for five-star iTunes reviews.

1386
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,561
[SPEAKER_03]: But I personally ask for their cash.

1387
01:31:45,141 --> 01:31:49,404
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't always get it, though, just like Loki's not going to get that Xbox 360.

1388
01:31:49,724 --> 01:31:52,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got $3 exactly from listeners.

1389
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:54,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot to mention this as part of the last-minute story.

1390
01:31:54,527 --> 01:31:57,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have a listener buy me dinner, so I guess that was kind of cool.

1391
01:31:57,088 --> 01:32:00,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I was sent a dollar by a listener in Boston, and then I got sent a $2 bill.

1392
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:03,512
[SPEAKER_03]: and a bunch of Doctor Who fanzines.

1393
01:32:24,745 --> 01:32:34,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Peekaboo is pleased to confirm that it's in talks to develop a game for the Wii that meets mainstream demand for fun and fitness benefits of pole dancing.

1394
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:37,731
[SPEAKER_07]: The company said in an email... This has to be a joke.

1395
01:32:37,891 --> 01:32:48,335
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Peekaboo and its partners are focused on using Wii-friendly hardware to make aerobic pole dancing instantly accessible, just as Guitar Hero did for Rock'n'Roll.

1396
01:32:49,745 --> 01:32:56,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I have to say that there are some fitness places that offer pole dancing as an exercise.

1397
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:58,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you think this is a joke, but this is on ABC News.

1398
01:32:59,292 --> 01:33:03,955
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I fully believe it because I've seen advertisements for pole dancing classes.

1399
01:33:04,735 --> 01:33:05,536
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

1400
01:33:06,932 --> 01:33:07,632
[SPEAKER_08]: What can I say?

1401
01:33:07,692 --> 01:33:11,833
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just more of the randomness you've come to expect and love from Orange Lounge Radio.

1402
01:33:11,853 --> 01:33:13,354
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do it all again next week.

1403
01:33:13,954 --> 01:33:15,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Same time, same place.

1404
01:33:15,594 --> 01:33:17,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Until then, I'm Rob.

1405
01:33:17,355 --> 01:33:18,055
[SPEAKER_08]: She's Jamie.

1406
01:33:18,115 --> 01:33:18,735
[SPEAKER_08]: He's Loki.

1407
01:33:18,835 --> 01:33:19,936
[SPEAKER_08]: We're Orange Lounge Radio.

1408
01:33:19,976 --> 01:33:20,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night!

1409
01:33:21,036 --> 01:33:23,837
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1410
01:33:24,337 --> 01:33:27,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1411
01:33:28,018 --> 01:33:36,645
[SPEAKER_01]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

1412
01:33:37,145 --> 01:33:48,714
[SPEAKER_01]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or AllGames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

1413
01:33:49,334 --> 01:33:50,155
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week!
