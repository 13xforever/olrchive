1
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:22,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, April 13th, 2008, Brazil bans a popular video game, could BBC shows soon be coming to the Nintendo Wii?

2
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:25,667
[SPEAKER_00]: And we interview Farbs, the creator of Rom Check Fail.

3
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:36,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:38,503
[SPEAKER_08]: A very special week for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:43,847
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, it's the first week of us live and exclusive on allgames.com.

6
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:51,253
[SPEAKER_08]: The old chapter of our Orange Lounge Radio feed on Live 365 closed as of yesterday and now we're on our new home at allgames.com.

7
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:55,616
[SPEAKER_08]: So a big hello to all of our new live listeners that we've got over at allgames.com.

8
00:00:56,116 --> 00:01:02,181
[SPEAKER_08]: and hello to those of you still joining us, be it through the podcast feed or our old OLR faithful or what be you.

9
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:05,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, you can always join our chat room to interact with the show.

10
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:09,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a quick footnote for the live folks, it is a different chat room than all games usually uses.

11
00:01:09,107 --> 00:01:13,791
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to want to head over to chat.orangeloungeradio.com or if you're already on the Game Surge Network.

12
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,952
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

13
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:45,962
[SPEAKER_08]: to much to Bobby's dismay.

14
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,103
[SPEAKER_08]: You do have the ferret here in the studio with us joining us.

15
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

16
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:51,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

17
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:52,345
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, Loki?

18
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:52,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

19
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:53,525
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

20
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're full of pizza, if I'm not mistaken.

21
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, breadsticks and stuff.

22
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, when you came walking up to the door, you had like two pizza boxes.

23
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:02,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, damn, Loki, you're fat.

24
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Fat with a PH, Loki.

25
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:06,969
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I love you.

26
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,672
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, it was one pizza and one thing of bread.

27
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:17,055
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, we here at OLR, for those of you on all games who haven't heard our show before, we like food almost as much as we like video games.

28
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I especially like video games about food.

29
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:22,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Cooking Mama.

30
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:27,620
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how some people say that they like to watch porn while they do it?

31
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to eat food while I'm playing video games about food.

32
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:38,260
[SPEAKER_08]: So while you're like playing Cooking Mama, do you actually cook things that you're cooking in Cooking Mama?

33
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,081
[SPEAKER_04]: No, however, it did inspire me to try to make one of the dishes once.

34
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,321
[SPEAKER_08]: We should try that one night.

35
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:47,881
[SPEAKER_08]: We should do some, you know, Cooking Mama, like for reals.

36
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:51,222
[SPEAKER_04]: The instructions in that game are actually semi-realistic.

37
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:52,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

38
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:56,123
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of those dishes are stuff I make anyway because I'm an awesome cook.

39
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:57,903
[SPEAKER_08]: And so humble.

40
00:02:58,403 --> 00:02:59,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I am.

41
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,284
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the same type of thing, you know.

42
00:03:03,588 --> 00:03:08,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Same situation, you know, to watch something and then, you know, participate, sort of.

43
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:09,662
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

44
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:40,804
[SPEAKER_04]: It was meaty, no.

45
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:42,005
[SPEAKER_08]: So meaty.

46
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:49,230
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my gaming week was actually, I know I always say it's pinball oriented, but this week was especially pinball oriented.

47
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Dan is hosting his pinball group gathering tonight.

48
00:03:56,675 --> 00:04:01,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence another reason why I feel very blessed to be here tonight.

49
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:05,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to be around loud, stranger men that I don't know.

50
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:13,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so a lot of the week was actually spent testing out after shopping out some of the tables.

51
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:17,762
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had his friend Will's Judge Dredd torn apart all over our garage right now.

52
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just put it back together today and I hate that table.

53
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:20,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

54
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:33,898
[SPEAKER_04]: We also went to one of our local used movie CD places called Dimple and we almost picked up some 7800 games, but then we remember that we probably already own them.

55
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:45,809
[SPEAKER_04]: The way you know that you have too much in your collection is when you have to actually stop and ask yourself, do I own this or even worse, how many copies of this do I already have?

56
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:52,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I've come home with a game for Dan, and now the unique thing about it is that I did have the manual in the box.

57
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:52,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 5200 game.

58
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,180
[SPEAKER_04]: We had three other copies of it.

59
00:04:56,502 --> 00:05:00,445
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to get one of those little personal organizers just for your video game collections.

60
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:02,967
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually pull up an Excel spreadsheet on the go.

61
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:04,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, do I have this game?

62
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:05,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it have the manual with it?

63
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:06,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes or no?

64
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,191
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty hardcore video game collector.

65
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:12,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we actually did have a list like that for a while.

66
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:15,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think we lost it in a computer crash.

67
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:27,673
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we just were sort of like you've seen our vault oh yes we have an entire room dedicated to the collection and um it's sort of overwhelming now

68
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a lot overwhelming now.

69
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever thought, like, one of these days we just need to get rid of this shit?

70
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:36,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, we need to call the 1-800-GOT-JUNK people or whatever it is.

71
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Bite your tongue.

72
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:38,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow.

73
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:39,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been bitten.

74
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:44,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan has said that we should get rid of some of it, and I'm like, you touch that collection, I kill you.

75
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:46,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, when you're dead, it's all mine.

76
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:53,969
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll divorce him when he's dead and then take over the collection.

77
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:55,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the best wife ever

78
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:16,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I want to buy a Virtual Boy system?

79
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:17,108
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I need to know.

80
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:18,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you do want a Virtual Boy system.

81
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:19,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

82
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how much do they want for it?

83
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:20,830
$75.

84
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, wait, I'm sorry.

85
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:24,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I read that wrong.

86
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:28,415
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be about $84.

87
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:31,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something you're looking at on eBay right now or something?

88
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:31,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

89
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:37,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now that you just said that on air, everybody else is going to go look that up and jack the price up.

90
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's buy it now.

91
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:39,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, buy it now.

92
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:39,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

93
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:43,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it's a piece of gaming history

94
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,741
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because you have to play.

95
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,825
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, you keep dying because there's no demo loop.

96
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:18,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever thought of actually just like building like a mock cabinet and having just something that cycles like an emulator?

97
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:25,557
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't want to build a cabinet for my desk because I think they'd be like, uh, what the hell's that in the office?

98
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:27,579
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my new arcade cabinet.

99
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't touch my arcade cabinet.

100
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, stuff that I played this week.

101
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:34,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was going to say, you know, we here on Orange Lounge Radio, we like to stay on the current news, too.

102
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:37,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just, you know, Virtual Boys and Atari 7800s.

103
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:39,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you been playing, like, 360, Wii, any of that stuff?

104
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,213
[SPEAKER_06]: This week I've only played two things, unfortunately.

105
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:56,322
[SPEAKER_06]: First one, of course, is Multiplayer Saints Row, because we're still playing that damn game until we can get Grand Theft Auto 4, which I did find out today, well, not today, but earlier this week, that my boss is going to buy me a...

106
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:13,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Special Edition of Grand Theft Auto 4 so that's awesome but at the same time I already pre-ordered another one just because you know we're going to need some for multiplayer and I think I need about two or three more copies on top of those too so five somewhere around there that reminds me I still have to fix my other 360 um

107
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:21,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, other than Saints Row, I did play Mario Kart Wii.

108
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:23,255
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of Mario Kart Wii.

109
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:27,918
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I've already finished 50cc and 100cc.

110
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, imported from the UK.

111
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,303
[SPEAKER_06]: And, well, what can I say about the game?

112
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:35,024
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Mario Kart.

113
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I like some new levels that are in there.

114
00:08:37,906 --> 00:08:38,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're really cool.

115
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:42,433
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that... A couple gripes I have about the game.

116
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:47,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the levels that they chose, like the classic levels, are kind of stupid choices.

117
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:47,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainbow Road.

118
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:52,619
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not... Well, Rainbow Road's kind of annoying, but that's just Rainbow Road.

119
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially even the battle modes.

120
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:58,043
[SPEAKER_06]: The battle courses that they chose are just kind of crappy.

121
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Which Rainbow Road did they bring over?

122
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:00,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

123
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:19,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I really think they could have chosen better tracks as well from the classic stuff.

124
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:24,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's a lot that just kind of resemble other tracks in the game that are already there.

125
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:29,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's three tracks that are kind of like the Donkey Kong... What was it?

126
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:30,656
[SPEAKER_06]: The one from...

127
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:32,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Double Dash.

128
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:39,062
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of like that, where you have a giant cannon that launches you to the top of the track and you race down back to the cannon and stuff.

129
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:40,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's alright.

130
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:44,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other weird gripes about it.

131
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Battle mode is only team based.

132
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:50,169
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot play against individual people.

133
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:50,730
What?! !

134
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:54,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can only play against, you have to be on one team or the other.

135
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:58,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have three people or four people and you want to battle each other, well, you can't.

136
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,898
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be on two-man teams.

137
00:10:01,238 --> 00:10:01,939
[SPEAKER_06]: That sucks.

138
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:03,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's retarded.

139
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder why they did that.

140
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,982
[SPEAKER_08]: You would think that's something that, you know, doesn't take a whole lot of extra programming.

141
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, it's just lazy.

142
00:10:09,383 --> 00:10:10,044
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it is.

143
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:10,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

144
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:11,785
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a weird change.

145
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:13,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that sucks.

146
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:19,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, though, you can customize a lot of stuff in there, like different item drops.

147
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:36,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried some of the ones that drop like the really supposedly big items like the more powerful items more frequently versus the normal drops and I didn't notice a difference so I don't know it's not very useful but

148
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:38,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Try it online a little bit.

149
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:41,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hardly able to get into any games right now.

150
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Online is kind of crappy as far as connecting to a game.

151
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:46,646
[SPEAKER_06]: But once you're in the game, it's fine.

152
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:49,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the way that they have it where you pick courses and stuff.

153
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:51,248
[SPEAKER_06]: You basically choose a course that you want.

154
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:56,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the computer randomly selects which player's choice gets picked and stuff.

155
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:57,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of neat.

156
00:10:57,671 --> 00:10:58,392
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

157
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:16,532
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's okay.

158
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:26,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not very good at... I like playing as Yoshi or the medium carts, so it's not very fast and I get beat pretty quick sometimes.

159
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:28,418
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like the tracks.

160
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:31,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the Mii integration in the game is pretty funny.

161
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:39,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially there's a mall level that you play in and there's a bunch of signs and stuff that are all throughout the mall with different Miis on there.

162
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:41,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's randomly selected each time you play the game.

163
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:44,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was one that I was driving through

164
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:51,768
[SPEAKER_06]: The very first time I played them all, my Chuck Norris Mii was on the coffee advertisement.

165
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:53,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there's another one with Jesus on there.

166
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:58,691
[SPEAKER_06]: And then later on in the level, you saw Hitler driving a car and stuff.

167
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Just absolutely funny stuff.

168
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:04,453
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's Goatse Mii driving a car one time.

169
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,954
[SPEAKER_06]: But for some reason, it likes selecting Saddam and Hitler Mii's.

170
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:10,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, but I see them the most frequently.

171
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:11,475
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

172
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:39,701
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's Mii always looks angry because she picked the little pointy eyebrows to make her look mad all the time, which is great.

173
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:12,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, you can play the game, and then eventually you unlock the Mii, the Drive S, which, here's my other gripe, and I haven't, I could be wrong about this, but I haven't tried multiplayer with it yet.

174
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:18,204
[SPEAKER_06]: In single player, when you're playing as the Mii character, you can't select which Mii it uses.

175
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:20,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only the one that you assign to your license.

176
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:25,247
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't swap it between other things, which is another lazy thing that they've done.

177
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:30,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also has the most retarded voice I've ever heard for a character.

178
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,809
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a retarded Mario voice.

179
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:38,091
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like... It's like, what the hell is that?

180
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:40,932
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like Goat Boy Me or something.

181
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:41,912
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is that?

182
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:44,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but... Can you make that sound again for us?

183
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:46,734
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

184
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

185
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:49,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the game.

186
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:53,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it a lot better than Smash Bros., but I love Mario Kart, so...

187
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:55,345
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?

188
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:16,610
[SPEAKER_08]: What actually you thought was Jesus was just Bobby.

189
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,391
[SPEAKER_08]: It could have been.

190
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:17,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly.

191
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:19,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking at some other comments.

192
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:27,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Some folks were talking about Mario Kart Double Dash because, you know, not everybody's played Mario Kart Wii yet, obviously, so it's been inspiring some talk about Mario Kart Double Dash.

193
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:31,565
[SPEAKER_08]: And Osfer speaking up for Double Dash, saying Double Dash was some fun shit.

194
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:36,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sephiroth1215 saying, yeah, see, I really don't understand why people don't like Double Dash.

195
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,306
[SPEAKER_08]: It was okay.

196
00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:38,906
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... Okay.

197
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:42,189
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing I didn't like about Double Dash is the battle mode really sucked.

198
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, the levels that they made for it, just awful.

199
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:59,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And even some of the levels in... Oh, that's the other thing, too, about... I don't remember the other Mario games too well, the Mario Kart games, but from what I remember before, you didn't have a point limit or a time limit.

200
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:00,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

201
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,867
[SPEAKER_06]: In the battle mode this time, you have a three-minute time limit for each game that you play.

202
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:11,010
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't just keep playing until someone loses, which is kind of lame.

203
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:16,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you lose all your balloons, you just get them all back, and it just keeps counting more scores.

204
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:18,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So the balloons are kind of pointless, too.

205
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:20,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

206
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:21,950
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

207
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:51,406
[SPEAKER_06]: But the good news is, though, for those that may have heard different stories claiming otherwise, the Classic Controller and the GameCube Controller are not gimped in any way whatsoever, so you can play them just fine with it.

208
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:53,186
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I use the Classic Controller for these games.

209
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:57,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mentioned there's got to be a huge difference between using an analog stick to control something and using the motion.

210
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:58,388
[SPEAKER_08]: There's got to be a huge difference.

211
00:15:58,428 --> 00:15:59,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't like the motion at all.

212
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:03,489
[SPEAKER_06]: And doing all the gestures that do different things, it's not very fun.

213
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

214
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer the classic controller of the GameCube.

215
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:26,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't stand Toadette.

216
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Toadette sucks.

217
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:43,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

218
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Overall, it's a pretty cool game.

219
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:47,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wish there were some better tracks.

220
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:50,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the classic tracks that they picked were kind of stupid.

221
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:56,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like, kind of, well, this track's easy, the remakes, so let's just pick this one instead of actually picking good tracks.

222
00:16:56,763 --> 00:16:58,024
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my only gripe.

223
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:00,887
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, it is an awesome game.

224
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:04,668
[SPEAKER_08]: DS Chargers, but they don't carry the ones you can plug in the wall.

225
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:36,729
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and I wasn't able to convince them to take me over to a GameStop or whatever, so I was just like, alright, so I'm just gonna, I guess, watch TV.

226
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:42,131
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it dawned on me, even though my parents, they only have a 56.6K dial-up connection to the internet.

227
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, so slow when you're spoiled with broadband.

228
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,412
[SPEAKER_08]: But they have the 56.6K connection to the internet.

229
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,013
[SPEAKER_08]: I downloaded emulators.

230
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:50,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Nintendo Games I'd Missed

231
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:16,833
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

232
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you like a cleric?

233
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:03,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of, but I don't think that's what he's called in the game.

234
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:06,614
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just a hero, is what he's called.

235
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:07,795
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a goat whisperer.

236
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:11,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in my game, he was called Butters, because you can name him whatever you want.

237
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:13,579
[SPEAKER_08]: So I named him Butters, because I like that name.

238
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I played a lot of Soul Blazer this week.

239
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:23,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, as far as newer games go, I went back to an MMO this week that I haven't played in a while.

240
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's not Final Fantasy XI.

241
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:28,929
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not Final Fantasy XI, but you would still be surprised.

242
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,991
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what MMO I played this week that I haven't played?

243
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:32,552
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura

244
00:19:56,023 --> 00:20:00,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually downloaded the expansion, The Ambition of the Illuminous, or whatever it's called.

245
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:03,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always jokingly called it The Abortion of the Illuminous.

246
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:04,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not on Xbox 360.

247
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:04,988
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't get it.

248
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:05,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

249
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:06,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have gotten it for you for free.

250
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:08,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

251
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,067
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

252
00:20:57,462 --> 00:21:03,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not yet, though, gotten the mag and all this other stuff that supposedly PSU is bringing back some of the old school stuff from Phantasy Star Online, but I'm not that far off yet.

253
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:05,807
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got the original four stages, too.

254
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:12,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that the people that are probably, if you're looking to play this game and you haven't done it yet, it's like 20 bucks now.

255
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:12,572
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very cheap.

256
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:17,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rob, casts can use four skills now.

257
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:17,916
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about time.

258
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XI

259
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:40,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Not too bad of a deal, I gotta say, if you want to get sucked into that crack.

260
00:21:41,144 --> 00:21:44,826
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have several MMO crack things to choose from on the Xbox 360.

261
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's going to do it for our gaming week.

262
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:47,407
[SPEAKER_08]: That was quite a bit tonight.

263
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:48,628
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a lot of games to talk about.

264
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about some housekeeping news.

265
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:55,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, last night the plug was pulled on our Live365 feed.

266
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:56,632
[SPEAKER_08]: It's no longer there.

267
00:21:57,572 --> 00:21:58,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of Live365, oh my god.

268
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I wrote them a cancellation email a week ago.

269
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:06,483
[SPEAKER_08]: You're supposed to give them three business days to cancel, right?

270
00:22:06,523 --> 00:22:07,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I wrote them an email a week ago.

271
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:08,924
[SPEAKER_08]: No response.

272
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:10,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Wrote them a second notice like Thursday or Friday.

273
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:11,565
[SPEAKER_08]: No response.

274
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:12,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess who charged my card today?

275
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:14,067
[SPEAKER_01]: The buttheads.

276
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:16,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the fun ever start?

277
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:20,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll keep you guys posted next week what happens with that.

278
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:21,831
[SPEAKER_08]: We might have to get nasty.

279
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:27,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Things keep going down this route because essentially they've taken money from me that I didn't pay for.

280
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:28,995
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of pissing me off.

281
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Call your bank and

282
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:31,364
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm going to do.

283
00:22:31,624 --> 00:22:32,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop payment.

284
00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:46,235
[SPEAKER_08]: So hello to allgames.com, our new home, which has deducted no money from my bank account this week, thankfully, because there are great people over at allgames.com who aren't sucking my money away, and they're friends, and we definitely urge you to check out the programming that's at allgames.com.

285
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:48,356
[SPEAKER_08]: They have something new every night.

286
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:52,057
[SPEAKER_08]: They re-air a bunch of podcasts that go on throughout the week.

287
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:55,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them have their debut on All Games Radio, so check that out.

288
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:58,400
[SPEAKER_08]: We debut, of course, Sunday nights before us, Bobby Blackwolf.

289
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,122
[SPEAKER_08]: In the morning times, All Games Interactive is on every day, Monday through Friday.

290
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:07,564
[SPEAKER_08]: So that show's on, I think, 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and they go through most of the morning.

291
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:10,605
[SPEAKER_08]: which would be actually early afternoon for the East Coast folks.

292
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:14,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So it really works out great for the East Coast folks who have to stay up really late to listen to us.

293
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:19,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, we want to remind you we have a special guest tonight, Farbs of Rom Check Fail fame.

294
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you like Orange Lounge Radio, you want to get to know us a little better, join our social networking.

295
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:28,273
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, we're MySpace whores just like everybody else and Facebook and all that other stuff.

296
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:30,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Our MySpace is MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

297
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,756
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have a live journal community at Orange Lounge, no radio.

298
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:35,338
[SPEAKER_08]: and Facebook.

299
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:44,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Just search for OL Army and you can add us on all those sites and stay tuned with all the news and when we shift networks and all that stuff you'll be on top of things and know where to catch us.

300
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the chat room is loving the new sound by the way because our feed now is 96k.

301
00:23:49,937 --> 00:23:49,977
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

302
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,723
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot clearer, the feed, than the 64K we were on with Live 365.

303
00:23:56,763 --> 00:23:57,764
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're really happy with that.

304
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:04,029
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think our podcast listeners are going to notice we also changed the audio on the podcast to be similar to what we're broadcasting at now.

305
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,211
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to be a whole new sound.

306
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:06,812
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay, Rob.

307
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:08,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just talk like this.

308
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:11,295
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll ruin the audio quality of the show this way.

309
00:24:11,335 --> 00:24:12,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll just do it this way.

310
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:13,537
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

311
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:15,439
[SPEAKER_05]: How much are you going to disagree with me tonight?

312
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:16,840
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think I'll let you disagree with me tonight?

313
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, let's see.

314
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:29,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So this week, the publisher of Famitsu Magazine thinks that they have an idea of what may be happening on E3 this year, one of the announcements.

315
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:35,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Their guess is that Nintendo is going to be announcing yet another revision of the DS.

316
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:41,111
[SPEAKER_06]: And their thinking behind this is because the timing seems to be right.

317
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:44,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently every two years or so is when they...

318
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:48,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Revise their portable systems.

319
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:52,439
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, there was the 1996 Game Boy Pocket.

320
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,381
[SPEAKER_06]: In 1998, there was the Game Boy Color.

321
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:55,802
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2001, there was the Game Boy Advance.

322
00:24:55,882 --> 00:24:57,844
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2003, there was the Game Boy Advance SP.

323
00:24:57,904 --> 00:24:58,805
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2004, there was the DS.

324
00:24:58,925 --> 00:24:59,586
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2006, there was the DS Lite.

325
00:24:59,646 --> 00:24:59,726
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2008...

326
00:25:12,182 --> 00:25:12,422
[SPEAKER_06]: The DS Micro

327
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:28,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

328
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:31,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe they'll just do nothing and won't they feel stupid?

329
00:25:31,451 --> 00:25:35,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so in other words, Famitsu Magazine is basically saying this.

330
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:40,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo likes to redo shit and make you buy it all over again all the time.

331
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:42,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So 2008 will be nothing new.

332
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:42,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

333
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:43,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Is essentially what they're saying.

334
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:44,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

335
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is news how?

336
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

337
00:25:47,682 --> 00:25:50,704
[SPEAKER_06]: It's news because... I don't know.

338
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:52,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're talking about E3.

339
00:25:53,606 --> 00:25:54,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And people like talking about E3.

340
00:25:56,628 --> 00:26:03,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Odd One says, but this time it's got, what the hell else can they do to this thing other than make it smaller or give it storage?

341
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:05,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, there's a thought.

342
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:14,820
[SPEAKER_08]: What about turning the DS a little bit PSP-ish where, hey, not only is it a DS, but it plays MP3s and it has scheduling things.

343
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I refuse to buy one if it does that.

344
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, I gotta know this.

345
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that?

346
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:21,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the same reason why I'm not too fond of the PSP.

347
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got way too much shit in it.

348
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:26,899
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to play a game, I want a system that plays a game.

349
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an iPhone already.

350
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:28,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

351
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:29,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to be honest.

352
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:32,884
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of one thing I like about the PSP is that it's a little bit of everything.

353
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,864
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

354
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:34,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's kind of neat.

355
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:38,668
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want your video game system to have everything, then that's fine.

356
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:39,629
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's what you want.

357
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:47,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me personally, because I already have the means to do all this other stuff, I really just want my system to play my video games.

358
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:56,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's something, a thought, and I could see this happening more than I could see, say, a new system coming out.

359
00:26:56,479 --> 00:27:03,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe an expansion that would plug into the bottom of the Game Boy Advance slot or whatever, and you would plug in your SD memory card, because guess what?

360
00:27:03,642 --> 00:27:08,265
[SPEAKER_06]: You have an SD memory card slot on your Wii, and so maybe this...

361
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:11,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, device or whatever that you plug into the bottom.

362
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:24,587
[SPEAKER_06]: That is flashable and that you can have firmware upgrades to and whatnot to allow it to play, say, emulate different games like the Virtual Console or stuff like that or WiiWare or something like that.

363
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:39,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that happening because that would be a little easier they can't just get rid of like if they make it a slimmer they're going to get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot then you're going to have stuff that uses it like say Guitar Hero on tour I don't think they're going to screw that over because that would be good for them

364
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:44,370
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot just yet.

365
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:14,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So why would they give you a device where you could get all this shit basically for free from the virtual console when they could recharge for it and people would buy it?

366
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:16,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because I don't think people would buy it.

367
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:25,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people would rather have a service available where they can download all these games and I think you'd get a lot more people downloading games.

368
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:30,015
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot easier to download games on the virtual console and pay a lot more money that way.

369
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:31,956
[SPEAKER_06]: That also saves some packaging.

370
00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:34,977
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have to press any of these stupid cartridges.

371
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:42,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the packaging and stuff, that would save them a lot of money, and it doesn't really cost them anything to transfer a file.

372
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:50,924
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, basically what they're going to probably want to do is prevent people from pirating this stuff, and that's about it.

373
00:28:51,344 --> 00:29:02,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Because right now with those other SD memory card things, yeah, you can pirate games like No End, but they'd have to create something that you wouldn't be able to do that.

374
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:04,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll see what happens.

375
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,951
[SPEAKER_06]: And besides, think of all the other things you could do.

376
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:11,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's essentially just like that PlayOn thing that they have available now.

377
00:29:11,393 --> 00:29:16,596
[SPEAKER_06]: You could use that as Game Boy, you know, not necessarily for, you know, virtual console games and stuff like that.

378
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:24,339
[SPEAKER_06]: MP3s, you can use it for, like, maybe small media files, you know, playing a really, really, really low-res movie or something like that, you know.

379
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:26,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, think of, I don't know, your...

380
00:29:28,305 --> 00:29:29,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

381
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:46,878
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

382
00:30:02,618 --> 00:30:12,183
[SPEAKER_08]: And we talked about this a little bit last week, and this is a bit of a follow-up, is that there was a rumor that Final Fantasy IV was, yes, it's going to be North American bound because it showed up on the cover of Nintendo Power and all this stuff.

383
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:14,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Squeenix confirmed it this week.

384
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:21,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy IV will be coming out July 22nd in North America, which is a little bit off from the date I seem to recall Loki mentioning last week.

385
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:23,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they revised it, bumped it up a week.

386
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,150
[SPEAKER_08]: All because of you, probably, right?

387
00:30:25,471 --> 00:30:25,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

388
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:25,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

389
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,354
[SPEAKER_08]: It is, of course, Final Fantasy IV with some graphical upgrades.

390
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:34,936
[SPEAKER_08]: They also get this fully voiced cutscenes and other added content.

391
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:38,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's going to be interesting, this whole mini-movie thing.

392
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:42,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And then my mistake from last week, it wasn't Dragon Quest V, it was Dragon Quest IV.

393
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:45,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

394
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:47,944
[SPEAKER_08]: That's also on its way, but that's a secret type thing, right?

395
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:48,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Shh, secret.

396
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:53,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so we'll see what happens next from Squeenix.

397
00:30:54,197 --> 00:31:05,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's probably why this game has taken a long time to come out from Japan to the US is because they're having to redo the voices now too, which I'm sure can't be an easy thing on the DS because then they have to go basically remake the whole cartridges and all that.

398
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:07,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So please, voice acting, don't suck in this.

399
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:11,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Please do not ruin my fond, fond memories of Final Fantasy 4 or I'll cry.

400
00:31:12,232 --> 00:31:14,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I just see why they can't leave it intact.

401
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:15,854
[SPEAKER_02]: But no.

402
00:31:16,515 --> 00:31:16,975
[SPEAKER_02]: But no.

403
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the classic version will be in there somewhere.

404
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:19,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

405
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:20,298
[SPEAKER_08]: One can hope.

406
00:31:20,902 --> 00:31:33,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at any rate, something else that has made a lot of people on the internet go squee, but not squeenix, okay, is a Strong Bad game coming to WiiWare, and I am very happy about this.

407
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:34,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you watch the trailer?

408
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:36,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not seen the trailer yet.

409
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:38,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, I was on 56.6k most of the week.

410
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:48,912
[SPEAKER_04]: The trailer is hilarious, but there is a game coming out called Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, which is, yeah...

411
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:49,871
[SPEAKER_08]: SBCG4AP

412
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:19,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're the ones that did the Sam & Max games.

413
00:32:20,645 --> 00:32:20,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they?

414
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:21,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

415
00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:25,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, that Sam & Max for the Wii, that's season one.

416
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:26,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Only.

417
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Only season one.

418
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:28,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank you for the update.

419
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:29,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

420
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:30,593
[SPEAKER_06]: But it should be reasonable.

421
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's going to be a trailer.

422
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:37,712
[SPEAKER_08]: The trailer is actually posted in our chat room right now.

423
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:41,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com from Tigerclaw found it on YouTube and dug that up.

424
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:46,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Going back to the last story because there's a lot of comments on the voice chat on Final Fantasy IV.

425
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:48,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Going back to some comments from our chat room.

426
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:49,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

427
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:55,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonathan F. is fantasizing Final Fantasy VI with voices because you would have the opera scene with singing.

428
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Celeste would actually sing the opera.

429
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,440
[SPEAKER_08]: That could go either way.

430
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:00,201
[SPEAKER_08]: DRAGON QUEST 4

431
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:36,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Shadow Slayer thinks it could be good if they get good voice actors Odd One says it's dependent on how big the card for the game is and Zeppelin says why can't they put one to two gigabyte in a DS card?

432
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:37,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure they can, can't they?

433
00:33:38,178 --> 00:33:38,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they can.

434
00:33:39,338 --> 00:33:39,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

435
00:33:39,678 --> 00:33:45,380
[SPEAKER_08]: If your camera can fit like two gigabytes I'm sure those DS cards can crank in like four gigabytes on those cards.

436
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,021
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd probably get some pretty massive games on there.

437
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:50,522
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is another rumor.

438
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there more on the Strong Bad stuff?

439
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:54,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I had more to say.

440
00:33:54,495 --> 00:33:54,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.

441
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:56,016
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's okay.

442
00:33:56,616 --> 00:33:58,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's nobody in chat commenting on it either.

443
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,236
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think of the Strong Bad game?

444
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:03,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Black Wolf says the Strong Bad game is also coming to the PC.

445
00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:07,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you don't want to download that on the Wii, you can also get it on the PC.

446
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:11,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was going to say the type of game is a 3D point.

447
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,839
[SPEAKER_04]: To actually quote a quote from Strong Bad.

448
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:15,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

449
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a puffy 3D point and click them up adventure.

450
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:21,821
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to do it in the Strong Bad voice.

451
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:22,101
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

452
00:34:24,597 --> 00:34:25,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan can do the strong and bad voice.

453
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot.

454
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:31,144
[SPEAKER_08]: You can turn the light switch on or off.

455
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,166
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I remember.

456
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:33,767
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

457
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not install it so you could have a light switch rave.

458
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:39,153
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

459
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:40,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Winner or sellout?

460
00:34:42,253 --> 00:34:43,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.

461
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:44,234
[SPEAKER_08]: It all depends on the game.

462
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:48,916
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's hopeful if it's the same folks that did Sam and Max.

463
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:49,277
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

464
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:54,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Another game that hopefully will be coming soon, Elebits 2.

465
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:05,705
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, this is coming from the latest issue of the official Nintendo magazine, reporting that Elebits 2 will be due out on the Wii later this year.

466
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:10,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is odd, because I thought it was supposed to be due out on the DS later this year.

467
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:20,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, it'll be coming to a Nintendo system this year, probably, and hopefully won't be just mediocre like the last game.

468
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:25,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of like the last game, with the level designs and stuff like that.

469
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:31,476
[SPEAKER_08]: The last game was kind of neat, but there was something about it that didn't keep me there long-term, you know what I mean?

470
00:35:31,516 --> 00:35:33,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I just felt like there wasn't a...

471
00:35:34,226 --> 00:35:34,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

472
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they have a lot more they can play with.

473
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:05,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure technologies have come along in developing the Wii games as well as online possibly, which could be interesting.

474
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:12,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what they could do with a DS version of the game because a lot of that game required you to be able to pull on the remote and twist it and stuff like that.

475
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:20,488
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be hard to not have that depth sensing that the Wii version had in the DS version.

476
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:24,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Some comments from chat on Elebits.

477
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Sephiroth1215 not happy from this.

478
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, no, I hate Elebits.

479
00:36:27,741 --> 00:36:30,302
[SPEAKER_08]: And RawSteelUT says, it's Elebits, no one cares.

480
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Frisbee wants to mention it was a launch title in Japan.

481
00:36:35,464 --> 00:36:39,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Quiltipo says, Elebits seemed good at the time, but no staying power though.

482
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:42,806
[SPEAKER_08]: And Gerardimo says, Elebits was good and innovative, just shallow.

483
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:45,007
[SPEAKER_08]: That might actually be a good way of phrasing it.

484
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:46,521
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

485
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:49,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you really want to appreciate Elebits, but I don't know.

486
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,163
[SPEAKER_08]: It just kind of got old quick.

487
00:36:50,563 --> 00:36:53,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join in the fun here on this Sunday night.

488
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:56,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, we are on a new network, AllGames.com.

489
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:57,886
[SPEAKER_08]: At this time, we're not.

490
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,927
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just too much to read the All Games chat and the Orange Lounge chat.

491
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:05,929
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have people chatting on Justin.TV as well who thinks I'm neglecting them over on Justin.TV.

492
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:06,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not.

493
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:14,033
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a lot to read and try to do a show at the same time and bring you more gaming news like this one about the white...

494
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:15,974
[SPEAKER_08]: GameCube Controllers

495
00:37:42,953 --> 00:37:57,767
[SPEAKER_08]: and now Mario Kart Wii we know is going to support the GameCube controller so this is going to be coming out in Japan but the odd thing is why not a WaveBird controller that would make so much more sense because the WaveBird was pretty awesome I don't know if it's a cost thing or what

496
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,158
[SPEAKER_08]: But who knows if this will be coming out here.

497
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,780
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually a lot sooner and later this year.

498
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,223
[SPEAKER_08]: That is coming out later this month, according to Nintendo of Japan's website.

499
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,204
[SPEAKER_08]: So, pretty cool.

500
00:38:09,945 --> 00:38:13,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, do you think they ought to bring white wavebirds to the Wii?

501
00:38:13,888 --> 00:38:17,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Or does it matter because if you didn't buy one... Because there already are wavebirds?

502
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:18,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

503
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:20,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there already are wavebirds?

504
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,593
[SPEAKER_08]: But they don't make them anymore.

505
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:22,173
[SPEAKER_02]: So?

506
00:38:22,974 --> 00:38:25,696
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're basically saying screw you to everyone who didn't get one, like me.

507
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:28,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I can bring them over.

508
00:38:28,578 --> 00:38:29,018
[SPEAKER_08]: You suck.

509
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:36,405
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, and I'll tell you this, remember when they came out with those different colored controllers for the GameCube?

510
00:38:37,305 --> 00:38:37,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um...

511
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:40,672
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop, GameCrazy

512
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:08,398
[SPEAKER_08]: You sometimes see these little random import things too at random stores.

513
00:39:08,418 --> 00:39:10,179
[SPEAKER_08]: You just kind of have to look around, you know what I mean?

514
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:27,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you one, our oddest find as far as import anything went at actual GameStop was buying Capcom Classic Collection Volume 2, which was the Ghosts and Goblins, the Makai Mura, Dai Makai Mura.

515
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,510
[SPEAKER_08]: But it never came out here, right?

516
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,251
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we never got that collection.

517
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:32,252
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the Japanese one.

518
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:33,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

519
00:39:34,564 --> 00:39:37,066
[SPEAKER_04]: at a GameStop in Hilltop Mall.

520
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:41,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Several people in chat, by the way, mentioning that the WaveBirds did not have Rumble.

521
00:39:41,808 --> 00:39:44,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps that's the reason Nintendo is deciding not to do it.

522
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Sony learned the hard way, you gotta have Rumble.

523
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:54,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumble is not so last gen, as they tried to say at E3 a couple years ago.

524
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,497
[SPEAKER_08]: They learned the hard way, so maybe that's why.

525
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:59,979
[SPEAKER_08]: But why, I mean, is a WaveBird with Rumble that hard to do?

526
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:01,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is it?

527
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:02,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

528
00:40:02,888 --> 00:40:03,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's just me.

529
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:04,690
[SPEAKER_06]: It's impossible.

530
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,914
[SPEAKER_08]: If the Xbox 360 wireless can do rumble, I would think.

531
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:09,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's just me.

532
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:13,121
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that hard.

533
00:40:13,362 --> 00:40:13,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think so.

534
00:40:14,503 --> 00:40:17,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not even, no, no, no, no, no.

535
00:40:17,747 --> 00:40:18,228
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on.

536
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:19,415
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

537
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:38,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't know anything about Soul Eater, there's a Wikipedia article, so enjoy.

538
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:42,744
[SPEAKER_04]: But it will be coming to the U.S.

539
00:40:43,384 --> 00:40:45,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, my apologies.

540
00:40:45,905 --> 00:40:49,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, it's listed as Japan only, and I don't think it's going to be coming out anywhere else.

541
00:40:52,187 --> 00:40:56,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because honestly, I don't even think the Soul Eater manga has come out over in the U.S., has it?

542
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:00,450
[SPEAKER_08]: You're asking the wrong guy about when it comes to manga.

543
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,230
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole point of the...

544
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:16,873
[SPEAKER_04]: of the, I guess, manga is that these people are going to this technical school to make weapons and have to make this one weapon out of 99 evil human souls and one belonging to this witch to make a death scythe.

545
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:20,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I think death scythe, and I think back to Gundam Wing, so whatever.

546
00:41:20,714 --> 00:41:22,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the way you describe it, it sounds kind of cool.

547
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:24,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would be something I would read.

548
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,976
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know if that's something that would come out here.

549
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:28,096
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, I don't know.

550
00:41:28,176 --> 00:41:30,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll read the manga, I guess.

551
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:32,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost bought that game on DS.

552
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll Never Forgive Him for that PlayStation 1.

553
00:41:59,001 --> 00:41:59,742
[SPEAKER_08]: What was PlayStation 1?

554
00:41:59,902 --> 00:42:00,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that Legend of Mana?

555
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:01,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Mana.

556
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:02,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I hated that game.

557
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:03,726
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what my problem with Legend of Mana was?

558
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:04,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated that game.

559
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:04,848
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

560
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:07,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I imported it like a dumbass.

561
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:14,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the most text-intensive, kanji-heavy game I have ever freaking played.

562
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:19,883
[SPEAKER_04]: and I could read like five words on an entire page.

563
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:22,444
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what other Squeenix collection I can't stand?

564
00:42:22,544 --> 00:42:25,444
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've done more than one games in the series and I can't even remember the name of it.

565
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:29,665
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the one where there's like eight different people and they have the eight stories.

566
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:30,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Saga Frontier.

567
00:42:30,526 --> 00:42:32,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I freaking hate the Saga series.

568
00:42:32,626 --> 00:42:33,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannot stand it.

569
00:42:33,646 --> 00:42:35,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, RPG fans and Saga fans, but...

570
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:47,728
[SPEAKER_08]: If you thought that, you know, because I do give Final Fantasy a lot of love here on the show, Chrono series, things like that, but if you thought that Squeenix could do no wrong, just go play the Saga series sometime.

571
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:48,629
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty good.

572
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't they ever carry on, like, the Tobol series?

573
00:42:51,931 --> 00:42:52,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that one.

574
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:54,433
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Alundra?

575
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:57,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Brave Fencer Musashi was them, wasn't it?

576
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they did a new one.

577
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were cute.

578
00:43:00,337 --> 00:43:01,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I like PlayStation 2.

579
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:01,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

580
00:43:04,272 --> 00:43:11,759
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this is also another article kind of correcting some more wrongs with Mario Kart Wii.

581
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:16,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there was news before that Mario Kart Wii did not work with the Freeloader.

582
00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:18,825
[SPEAKER_06]: However, that is false.

583
00:43:18,985 --> 00:43:21,968
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually does work just fine with the Freeloader.

584
00:43:22,028 --> 00:43:23,689
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if you happen to live in the U.S.

585
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:26,191
[SPEAKER_06]: and want to pick up a copy of the European version...

586
00:43:27,212 --> 00:43:29,373
[SPEAKER_06]: and get it a few weeks before we get it here.

587
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:34,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Then go right ahead and pick one up because the freeloader will work just fine.

588
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:44,698
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, import retailer NCS tested the game on a version 3.1 firmware and it ran just fine.

589
00:43:45,118 --> 00:43:50,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently there was some issues, I guess, with 3.0 firmware.

590
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you update your firmware, it should be good to go.

591
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:55,642
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

592
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:57,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Great game.

593
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:28,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, apparently on Mario Kart Wii, there are already people cheating in there.

594
00:44:29,348 --> 00:44:31,268
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's in the time trials mode, apparently.

595
00:44:31,328 --> 00:44:35,349
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all these impossible times that are showing up in the time trials mode.

596
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:40,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, somebody on the official Nintendo Magazine forums wrote this on here.

597
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I only saw it on the snowboard track.

598
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:45,592
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a guy with a time of 53 points, something or other seconds.

599
00:44:45,872 --> 00:44:48,633
[SPEAKER_08]: There are about three other people with exactly the same time.

600
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:55,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Like others have said, on the replay, the guy just does one lap really slow and then turns the opposite way just after the finish line.

601
00:44:56,264 --> 00:44:57,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the replay doesn't stop.

602
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:00,850
[SPEAKER_08]: So he says, personally, I think it's a bug.

603
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only seen it on one track and there are others with the same time.

604
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:23,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently what's happening, and I'm not positive this is actually the case, but what I heard was that if you let the time trial sit there for longer than 99 minutes and 99 seconds and .99, it'll actually loop back around to zero again.

605
00:45:23,571 --> 00:45:33,659
[SPEAKER_06]: So people were racing through a couple laps or whatever, and then they would stop, wait for it to just barely flip over from

606
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,862
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, who has time to do that?

607
00:45:37,022 --> 00:45:37,662
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, really?

608
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:42,425
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to sit there and wait for 99 minutes or even, you know, just leaving it on, doing that.

609
00:45:42,486 --> 00:45:44,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the hell you're doing, you know, going up.

610
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:44,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Obsessed people.

611
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:51,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Going out drinking or something and coming back 90 minutes later just to have a high score.

612
00:45:53,573 --> 00:45:55,154
[SPEAKER_06]: That we all know is a piece of crap.

613
00:45:55,394 --> 00:46:00,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Well the thing about that too though, Nintendo has actually removed those scores off of their leaderboards now.

614
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:03,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So Nintendo is cracking down.

615
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:07,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm just waiting for it to happen where people find a way to cheat in the multiplayer mode.

616
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:08,438
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

617
00:46:08,778 --> 00:46:10,559
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be a... Oh my god.

618
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:15,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope Nintendo knows a way to patch this game on the fly if things like that happen.

619
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:17,681
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

620
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:19,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

621
00:46:19,302 --> 00:46:22,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they have it built in yet where they can patch games.

622
00:46:23,682 --> 00:46:26,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they don't have it built in yet where they can patch games.

623
00:46:27,065 --> 00:46:29,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Does their firmware updates patch the games?

624
00:46:29,527 --> 00:46:32,029
[SPEAKER_06]: There's firmware updates, but I don't think they patch games.

625
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:37,393
[SPEAKER_06]: The good thing, though, is they don't have an action replay yet for the Wii.

626
00:46:37,433 --> 00:46:40,575
[SPEAKER_06]: They only have game saves and power saves and stuff like that.

627
00:46:42,837 --> 00:46:43,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

628
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:49,923
[SPEAKER_06]: There shouldn't really be a way to cheat, unless you do something with the servers or whatever where you lag someone out.

629
00:46:50,003 --> 00:46:50,143
[SPEAKER_06]: But

630
00:46:51,363 --> 00:46:54,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus it just goes back to, if you're cheating online, why?

631
00:46:54,786 --> 00:46:55,347
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, why?

632
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

633
00:46:55,787 --> 00:46:56,708
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you got to prove?

634
00:46:56,728 --> 00:46:57,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

635
00:46:57,709 --> 00:46:58,150
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

636
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:05,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh, you beat three other strangers in an online Mario match when Nintendo doesn't even tell you who you're playing against.

637
00:47:05,717 --> 00:47:07,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's kind of like, big wow.

638
00:47:07,879 --> 00:47:08,199
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

639
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,542
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, do you really have to feel that special?

640
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:11,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

641
00:47:11,983 --> 00:47:12,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's just me.

642
00:47:13,846 --> 00:47:21,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of special people, you know that there's always that time top 100 most influential people that they do.

643
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:24,204
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess who's on the list this year?

644
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:25,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

645
00:47:25,754 --> 00:47:26,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Miyamoto!

646
00:47:27,035 --> 00:47:27,976
[SPEAKER_04]: He is on the list this year.

647
00:47:28,176 --> 00:47:28,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

648
00:47:29,657 --> 00:47:36,383
[SPEAKER_04]: He has been voted for 25,000 times as of the source I'm reading.

649
00:47:36,803 --> 00:47:38,184
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's at number 31 out of 200.

650
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:43,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And is at 56%.

651
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:48,553
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically he's been put on there for making Mario and Zelda...

652
00:47:49,313 --> 00:48:07,578
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh for uh the new Wii stuff you know the things he's trying to do with the Wii um and that and as he's been quoted saying that he wants to make people more aware of their bodies and get in better shape and and use that as a tool to improve their life and not just slack around you know

653
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:11,159
[SPEAKER_08]: How much influence does the online poll have in the final result?

654
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:27,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Captain America's Shield

655
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, some comments from Justin TV, actually, who says I ignore them all the time.

656
00:48:55,992 --> 00:48:58,513
[SPEAKER_08]: But a good comment here about the whole patching of Wii games.

657
00:48:59,093 --> 00:49:04,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Richie Maniac says they can't patch, otherwise they would have fixed Guitar Hero 3 without sending out new discs.

658
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good point.

659
00:49:05,815 --> 00:49:08,977
[SPEAKER_08]: So if somebody's cheating in Mario Kart, there's nothing they can do about it.

660
00:49:09,257 --> 00:49:12,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm putting the link to vote for Miyamoto in the chat room.

661
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:13,978
[SPEAKER_08]: But you could cheat however much you want.

662
00:49:17,623 --> 00:49:19,964
[SPEAKER_08]: and BlackWolf is correcting me and saying it's Colbert.

663
00:49:20,004 --> 00:49:21,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was just something he did on the show.

664
00:49:21,665 --> 00:49:22,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Is his last name really Colbert?

665
00:49:22,765 --> 00:49:24,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was just a show joke.

666
00:49:25,026 --> 00:49:34,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I know people with the exact same last name in real life, but they pronounce it with the hard T. That's why it's the Colbert Report.

667
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:36,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was a joke.

668
00:49:37,312 --> 00:49:38,273
[SPEAKER_04]: People, don't correct me, okay?

669
00:49:40,114 --> 00:49:40,934
[SPEAKER_04]: This is pissing me off.

670
00:49:40,974 --> 00:49:41,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hot in here.

671
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,835
[SPEAKER_08]: It is hot in here today.

672
00:49:44,235 --> 00:49:44,936
[SPEAKER_08]: What is up with the weather?

673
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:51,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's another game that got announced this week during Nintendo's Media Summit.

674
00:49:52,097 --> 00:49:54,378
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is not really a big surprise at all.

675
00:49:54,418 --> 00:50:01,300
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I want to say we've already seen this being announced at E3 last year, but whatever.

676
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:07,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, it is Super Mario, or I should say Mario Super Sluggers.

677
00:50:08,123 --> 00:50:08,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

678
00:50:09,753 --> 00:50:15,241
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, of course, a continuation of Super Mario Stadium Baseball.

679
00:50:17,003 --> 00:50:25,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Just another sports game from Nintendo that's capitalizing on Mario, just like Mario Strikers and stuff.

680
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:39,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they don't do this, but I could just see them, because they're kind of following the bad trends that third-party companies are creating accessories for, like those attachments for the Wii Sports stuff.

681
00:50:40,045 --> 00:50:44,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I could just see them releasing this game with a baseball bat attachment or something for the Wii.

682
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, try to sell a few more copies.

683
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:47,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

684
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:48,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my question.

685
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:51,991
[SPEAKER_08]: What really is the difference between the Super Sluggers thing and the Strikers?

686
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:53,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, aren't they just kind of both baseball games?

687
00:50:54,212 --> 00:50:56,893
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Strikers is a soccer game, whereas Sluggers is a baseball game.

688
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:57,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, what the hell am I thinking?

689
00:50:58,094 --> 00:51:01,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I... But there's another... Wasn't there another... Yeah, there was Mario Baseball.

690
00:51:01,616 --> 00:51:05,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know there's another baseball game that already freaking came out on the Wii.

691
00:51:05,658 --> 00:51:05,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

692
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:06,358
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on the GameCube?

693
00:51:06,378 --> 00:51:07,058
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was on the GameCube, yeah.

694
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:10,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I could have sworn there was already a baseball game on the Wii.

695
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,881
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just like how there was... Was it...

696
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:18,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what the other... There was another soccer game that was on GameCube as well.

697
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:23,465
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just import whatever sport with Mario in it.

698
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:26,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty soon it'll be Mario synchronized swimming.

699
00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:28,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Just in time for the Beijing Olympics.

700
00:51:28,466 --> 00:51:32,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see how there could be any popular Japanese franchise that won't have a baseball game attached to it.

701
00:51:32,947 --> 00:51:33,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

702
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:35,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Baseball is like the sport.

703
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:36,796
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

704
00:51:36,876 --> 00:51:37,996
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what, Rob?

705
00:51:38,116 --> 00:51:41,957
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be happy to know that Toadette is in this game as well.

706
00:51:42,157 --> 00:51:42,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitch.

707
00:51:42,918 --> 00:51:43,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

708
00:51:44,218 --> 00:51:48,399
[SPEAKER_08]: RossSteelUT in chat.orangelearn.com says, Oh, baseball on the Wii.

709
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:49,899
[SPEAKER_08]: This will appeal to the fanboys, really.

710
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:51,720
[SPEAKER_08]: The casuals still have Wii Sports.

711
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would think that baseball fanboys would go for something a little more hardcore.

712
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Like MLB 2K8?

713
00:51:56,841 --> 00:51:58,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it would necessarily be on the Wii.

714
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:01,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Or MLB Power Pros, you know, where it was just another baseball game?

715
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:02,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Or...

716
00:52:02,742 --> 00:52:04,784
[SPEAKER_06]: They've already got, like, plenty of baseball games on there.

717
00:52:04,824 --> 00:52:08,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think these are the people that do like baseball on Wii Sports, but want to take it, like, one step further.

718
00:52:08,908 --> 00:52:09,669
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

719
00:52:09,689 --> 00:52:10,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

720
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:13,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how appealing that is, but Jamie does have a good point.

721
00:52:13,312 --> 00:52:15,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially over in Japan, baseball is huge.

722
00:52:15,274 --> 00:52:16,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, baseball's huge here, too.

723
00:52:17,496 --> 00:52:20,599
[SPEAKER_08]: It may not be as big as football in this day and age, but...

724
00:52:20,799 --> 00:52:23,501
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine, this game will come out in the E3 or whatever.

725
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:35,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling, because I heard some rumors before that this was going to be coming out in June, and then in July there was supposed to be that stupid disaster day of crisis.

726
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:46,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what blog I read that in, but if this does come out and stuff, and then E3 rolls around, and oh, guess what, Wii Sports 2, and it's like, ah, shit, I just bought this game, and now...

727
00:52:47,015 --> 00:52:52,401
[SPEAKER_06]: WeSports 2, which is going to be probably the number one selling game all time on Wii.

728
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:53,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario Hockey.

729
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:55,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Several people want to see that game in our chatroom.

730
00:52:55,764 --> 00:52:56,685
[SPEAKER_08]: A Mario Hockey game.

731
00:52:57,065 --> 00:53:01,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, though, because I think Nintendo might have a problem with people punching Mario in the face.

732
00:53:01,209 --> 00:53:06,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Hockey, all that would be is just like Super Mario Strikers with re-skin, basically, because...

733
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:08,276
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what they need?

734
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:10,777
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to bring back old school ice hockey.

735
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually had this game on the NES.

736
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:16,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not talking Blades of Steel, although that game was freaking rad too, but I'm talking old school ice hockey.

737
00:53:16,982 --> 00:53:23,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember this game where you had your entire team consisted of the fat guys, the skinny guys, and the average guys.

738
00:53:23,526 --> 00:53:24,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that?

739
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:24,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

740
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:25,627
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they need to do.

741
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:27,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Ice Hockey 2008, or Ice Hockey Wii.

742
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:29,610
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be rad.

743
00:53:31,491 --> 00:53:32,132
[SPEAKER_08]: You know you want it.

744
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:35,844
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

745
00:53:53,452 --> 00:53:55,953
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Nintendo Wii, nothing either.

746
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:59,874
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a dry week in Japan for these next batch of systems.

747
00:54:00,215 --> 00:54:05,616
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you want to go back to the PlayStation 2, Ape Escape 3 is coming out now in a Chinese language.

748
00:54:06,137 --> 00:54:09,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the other Asian regions abroad, Ape Escape 3 comes out in Chinese this week.

749
00:54:10,098 --> 00:54:14,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Also a game called Hoshigari Empusa comes out in Japan on April the 17th.

750
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:22,248
[SPEAKER_08]: and going over to the Nintendo DS, Gear Spirit from TV Animation One Piece.

751
00:54:22,348 --> 00:54:22,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Gear Spirit.

752
00:54:23,629 --> 00:54:26,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Also from Nintendo, Pack'n Ball comes out.

753
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:27,809
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew,

754
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:57,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Also on the Nintendo DS, Kansu Hajime Yoshisan Unyo DS comes out.

755
00:54:59,626 --> 00:55:01,307
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just... I don't know.

756
00:55:01,968 --> 00:55:04,810
[SPEAKER_08]: The cover has a bunch of people planting trees on it.

757
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:09,032
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if that's supposed to symbolize a tree of knowledge or what that is.

758
00:55:09,052 --> 00:55:11,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the category for the game is miscellaneous.

759
00:55:11,774 --> 00:55:15,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Which usually means some type of boring training type thing.

760
00:55:15,296 --> 00:55:16,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's a dating sim.

761
00:55:16,657 --> 00:55:18,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you actually use the touch screen and stuff.

762
00:55:19,259 --> 00:55:19,439
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

763
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:21,542
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perverted dating sim, no.

764
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:22,863
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not that kind of dating.

765
00:55:22,883 --> 00:55:24,685
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like, you know, I don't know.

766
00:55:24,705 --> 00:55:25,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm joking, Rob.

767
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:31,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if there's anything coming out on the PSP, although I somehow doubt it.

768
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:35,133
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll take a look real quick for the PSP in Japan.

769
00:55:35,713 --> 00:55:35,953
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

770
00:55:36,674 --> 00:55:38,295
[SPEAKER_08]: But the 24th will be a big week.

771
00:55:38,455 --> 00:55:41,237
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots more stuff coming out for you folks in Japan on the 24th.

772
00:55:41,277 --> 00:55:44,000
[SPEAKER_08]: But this week, you're going to have to just play the games you already have, I guess.

773
00:55:46,702 --> 00:55:47,042
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

774
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:58,312
[SPEAKER_04]: For the games that are coming out for our friends over in the UK, we have on the 16th, Trackmania Nations Forever on PC.

775
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:00,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Trackmania.

776
00:56:00,254 --> 00:56:02,035
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to look pretty awesome.

777
00:56:03,936 --> 00:56:04,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?

778
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:06,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

779
00:56:06,498 --> 00:56:06,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

780
00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:09,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I want that Konami track game where you can play as Pyramid Head.

781
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,741
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one I'm waiting for.

782
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:11,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?

783
00:56:11,562 --> 00:56:12,302
[SPEAKER_08]: The new track and field?

784
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:12,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

785
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:14,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want?

786
00:56:15,264 --> 00:56:16,505
[SPEAKER_08]: The hell with all the other track games.

787
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:16,846
[SPEAKER_08]: July or August.

788
00:56:16,866 --> 00:56:17,346
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you.

789
00:56:19,097 --> 00:56:25,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, also coming out, now this is on the 18th of this next series of games, which is the day before my birthday.

[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to need to get that game, okay?

793
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:52,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC UEFA Euro 2008 on PC Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 and PS2 and PSP and WonderSwan Color and Neo Geo Pocket Color and the Neo Geo CD those last four are probably not true

[SPEAKER_04]: The World Ends With You on DS.

798
00:57:04,123 --> 00:57:05,564
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of pressure, isn't it?

799
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,025
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like something you'd say before you kill someone.

800
00:57:08,446 --> 00:57:11,047
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that sounds like a Bond movie.

801
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:12,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it does.

802
00:57:12,308 --> 00:57:13,469
[SPEAKER_04]: It does sound like a Bond movie.

803
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And the very last is Time Crisis 4 on PlayStation 3.

804
00:57:17,412 --> 00:57:21,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Time Crisis.

805
00:57:22,754 --> 00:57:27,357
[SPEAKER_06]: In the US, it's an okay release week, I should say.

[SPEAKER_06]: Starting off, we've got Major League Baseball 2K8 Fantasy All-Stars for the DS.

807
00:57:37,443 --> 00:57:40,524

815
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:19,607
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of a weird name.

816
00:58:21,387 --> 00:58:23,928
[SPEAKER_06]: High School Musical 2 worked this out on the DS.

817
00:58:24,308 --> 00:58:26,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Also another Disney DS game.

818
00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:27,249
[SPEAKER_08]: What if I don't want to work it out?

819
00:58:28,101 --> 00:58:29,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you don't buy the game.

820
00:58:29,402 --> 00:58:30,063

[SPEAKER_02]: We have other releases.

830
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:12,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to get into that kind of crack?

831
00:59:13,609 --> 00:59:15,469
[SPEAKER_08]: What about the Virtual Console?

832
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:17,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these, of course, have already come out now.

833
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,491
[SPEAKER_04]: These are for our UK releases for Virtual Console.

834

836
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:30,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's Yoshi's Cookie.

837
00:59:31,012 --> 00:59:33,055
[SPEAKER_04]: What more do I need to say about freaking Yoshi's Cookie?

838
00:59:33,475 --> 00:59:35,458
[SPEAKER_08]: That it was far superior on the Super Nintendo.

839
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:37,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So why they released the Nintendo version, I have no idea.

840
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:38,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the next one.

841
00:59:39,983 --> 00:59:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: We need triumphant music for this, for these next two.

842
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:43,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, hold on.

843
00:59:43,925 --> 00:59:46,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have fanfare music somewhere.

844
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:47,507
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll just take me a minute.

845
00:59:47,547 --> 00:59:49,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you read a different one before you get to those two?

846
00:59:49,488 --> 00:59:51,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the next two are, these are the only two left.

847
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:53,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, are they?

848
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:55,011
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's more.

849
00:59:55,151 --> 00:59:57,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I will skip ahead and then I will go back to the awesome ones.

850
00:59:57,092 --> 00:59:59,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, good, because I'm getting the fanfare right now.

851
00:59:59,974 --> 01:00:02,395
[SPEAKER_04]: California Games, which is Commodore 64.

852
01:00:02,915 --> 01:00:06,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, Commodore 64 games are hitting the Wii finally.

853
01:00:06,537 --> 01:00:07,738
[SPEAKER_04]: And Impossible Mission.

854
01:00:10,249 --> 01:00:12,370
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one I should have played the fanfare for.

855
01:00:12,691 --> 01:00:19,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of them are 500 Wii points, 3 pounds 50 pence, or a 5 euro.

856
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:23,357
[SPEAKER_04]: But those aren't the two that... Stay a while.

857
01:00:23,377 --> 01:00:25,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay forever.

858
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:28,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever play Impossible Mission?

859
01:00:29,881 --> 01:00:31,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have a Commodore 64, Rob.

860
01:00:31,582 --> 01:00:31,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

861
01:00:32,242 --> 01:00:32,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you I didn't.

862
01:00:32,842 --> 01:00:33,403
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

863
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:34,263
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I had?

864
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:36,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the Texas Instruments stupid retardo computer.

865
01:00:38,025 --> 01:00:38,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a Clico Atom.

866
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still trying to find the sounds.

867
01:00:42,951 --> 01:00:43,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Darn it.

868
01:00:43,292 --> 01:00:44,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then I will go ahead.

869
01:00:44,632 --> 01:00:46,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I will go ahead and announce the one that semi gets fanfare.

870
01:00:47,154 --> 01:00:47,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you know why?

871
01:00:47,975 --> 01:00:49,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Because here's the thing.

872
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:52,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to upgrade Winamp to get Shoutcast now.

873
01:00:52,518 --> 01:00:55,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And for whatever reason, my Winamp is not playing WAV files.

874
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:56,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Although you think it would.

875
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:57,801
[SPEAKER_08]: The old one did.

876
01:00:58,582 --> 01:00:59,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I just haven't configured it right.

877
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,503
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have no sounds tonight.

878
01:01:01,684 --> 01:01:02,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

879
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:03,845
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have Loki sing a fanfare.

880
01:01:04,405 --> 01:01:04,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, hold on.

881
01:01:04,826 --> 01:01:05,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, sing the fanfare.

882
01:01:05,786 --> 01:01:06,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not singing the fanfare.

883
01:01:06,707 --> 01:01:07,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Sing the fanfare.

884
01:01:07,547 --> 01:01:08,228
[SPEAKER_08]: No fanfare.

885
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:08,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

886
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:09,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Use the NBC music.

887
01:01:10,956 --> 01:01:11,176
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

888
01:01:11,717 --> 01:01:12,658
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't use it, can you?

889
01:01:12,678 --> 01:01:13,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Just read it.

890
01:01:13,279 --> 01:01:14,920
[SPEAKER_04]: We're wasting so much time.

891
01:01:14,961 --> 01:01:16,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Precious time.

892
01:01:16,042 --> 01:01:19,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Wonder Boy from the Sega Master System.

893
01:01:19,105 --> 01:01:20,086
[SPEAKER_04]: 500 Wii Points.

894
01:01:20,527 --> 01:01:24,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And that game is really sweet, but this is the one that makes me super uber happy.

895
01:01:25,192 --> 01:01:26,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy Zone!

896
01:01:26,794 --> 01:01:28,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we announce this last week?

897
01:01:28,195 --> 01:01:28,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

898
01:01:30,332 --> 01:01:34,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we announced it was coming, but it wasn't really known when it was coming.

899
01:01:35,076 --> 01:01:40,521
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out now, you're the Opa Opa, and you get to shoot stuff, and it sort of plays like Defender, but it's awesome.

900
01:01:41,302 --> 01:01:45,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy Zone is my second favorite game ever.

901
01:01:46,405 --> 01:01:48,567
[SPEAKER_06]: and was one of the classic games of the week as well.

902
01:01:48,587 --> 01:01:50,689
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the first classic game of the week.

903
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:58,216
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, in the US on the Virtual Console you also get Yoshi's Cookie and Bases Loaded came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

904
01:01:58,236 --> 01:02:02,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of baseball games, if you want to play one of the classics, Bases Loaded will set you back 500 Wii Points.

905
01:02:05,143 --> 01:02:06,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we'll go back to some gaming news.

906
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:11,026
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I don't know.

907
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:13,107
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't exactly like totally gaming news.

908
01:02:13,127 --> 01:02:14,928
[SPEAKER_08]: This is basically what idiots think.

909
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:15,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

910
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:17,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe this should be a new segment on our show.

911
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:18,750
[SPEAKER_08]: What idiots think.

912
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:19,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

913
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:20,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the deal.

914
01:02:21,511 --> 01:02:24,333
[SPEAKER_08]: There's this website and it's called whattheyplay.com.

915
01:02:25,553 --> 01:02:31,277
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a parental-oriented website, and they did a poll a little earlier this week.

916
01:02:32,718 --> 01:02:39,123
[SPEAKER_08]: What they did in this poll is that they surveyed, what would you find most offensive in a video game?

917
01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:40,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the results.

918
01:02:41,565 --> 01:02:50,391
[SPEAKER_08]: The choices were a graphically severed human head, a man and a woman having sex, multiple use of the F word, and two men kissing.

919
01:02:52,048 --> 01:02:52,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing.

920
01:02:52,988 --> 01:02:57,449
[SPEAKER_08]: The least offensive, according to the poll, is multiple usages of the F word, 10%.

921
01:02:57,509 --> 01:03:04,271
[SPEAKER_08]: The second least offensive, a graphically severed human head with 26%.

922
01:03:04,311 --> 01:03:05,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, two men kissing, 27%.

923
01:03:15,242 --> 01:03:22,980
[SPEAKER_08]: So two men kissing is right in the same ballpark as a graphically severed human head in how offensive they are in a video game.

924
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,221
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

925
01:03:51,607 --> 01:03:52,787
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been that way forever.

926
01:03:53,448 --> 01:04:04,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say that we are probably one of the most... I'd have to say conflicting societies as far as... Because, you know, sex sells everything.

927
01:04:04,951 --> 01:04:08,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything, you know, the porn industry is thriving.

928
01:04:08,853 --> 01:04:09,313
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all this.

929
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:12,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet we have this other extreme like, oh, but we don't talk about that.

930
01:04:12,854 --> 01:04:13,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we don't do this.

931
01:04:13,814 --> 01:04:14,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we don't have this in our game.

932
01:04:15,015 --> 01:04:15,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is offensive.

933
01:04:16,915 --> 01:04:18,656
[SPEAKER_04]: People just need to get over it.

934
01:04:20,012 --> 01:04:25,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Siren says in our chat room, Siren, I keep mispronouncing it, says, what did the two men look like?

935
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:30,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that is important because if they're like two guys who haven't bathed in a week, that would be kind of offensive, I think.

936
01:04:31,656 --> 01:04:32,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the kissing would be offensive.

937
01:04:32,997 --> 01:04:35,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just think that the lack of personal hygiene would be offensive.

938
01:04:35,298 --> 01:04:36,258
[SPEAKER_06]: See if that's the point.

939
01:04:36,578 --> 01:04:48,943
[SPEAKER_06]: So where does, like, say, I don't know, two men kissing a graphically severed human head on top of a man and woman having sex while they shout obscenities, where does that fall on the list?

940
01:04:49,123 --> 01:04:50,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this your next dream game?

941
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:51,745
[SPEAKER_04]: WhatTheyPlay.com The Game

942
01:05:10,564 --> 01:05:12,166
[SPEAKER_08]: It's whattheyplay.com, the game.

943
01:05:12,526 --> 01:05:17,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And what it is is it stars three people, two guys and a girl.

944
01:05:18,153 --> 01:05:20,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And all they do is they know how to say the F word.

945
01:05:20,556 --> 01:05:21,717
[SPEAKER_08]: So we get the 10% there.

946
01:05:22,258 --> 01:05:25,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And meanwhile, the two guys will kiss.

947
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the man and the woman will have sex while they sever the other guy's head.

948
01:05:29,246 --> 01:05:29,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what...

949
01:05:33,385 --> 01:05:38,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure where the game is in this, but we'll find it somewhere.

950
01:05:38,189 --> 01:05:38,889
[SPEAKER_08]: To take pictures.

951
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:42,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like Pokemon Snap.

952
01:05:42,812 --> 01:05:43,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there it is.

953
01:05:44,453 --> 01:05:47,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more offensive the photo is...

954
01:05:48,564 --> 01:05:54,107
[SPEAKER_04]: The more gee the photo is, then that's beautiful, Rob.

955
01:05:54,267 --> 01:05:54,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this idea.

956
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:56,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I love your sick imagination.

957
01:05:56,068 --> 01:05:58,909
[SPEAKER_08]: It's What They Play Snap.

958
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I want to change the name.

959
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so an OLR dream game.

960
01:06:01,831 --> 01:06:02,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Here it is.

961
01:06:02,531 --> 01:06:04,412
[SPEAKER_08]: What They Play Snap.

962
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:05,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Add this to our wiki.

963
01:06:05,793 --> 01:06:05,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

964
01:06:06,814 --> 01:06:08,074
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a dream games wiki.

965
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:08,995
[SPEAKER_08]: There is.

966
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:09,895
[SPEAKER_08]: The dream games wiki.

967
01:06:09,915 --> 01:06:10,235
[SPEAKER_08]: There is?

968
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:10,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

969
01:06:10,736 --> 01:06:11,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.

970
01:06:11,356 --> 01:06:13,957
[SPEAKER_08]: There's already a wiki page on there, so we'll need to get this added.

971
01:06:14,618 --> 01:06:15,738
[SPEAKER_08]: What They Play Snap.

972
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:16,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And in What They Play Snap...

973
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:26,065
[SPEAKER_08]: is three people that use the F word, then half kiss each other, then half sex with each other, then kill each other while you take pictures on a track.

974
01:06:29,607 --> 01:06:35,471
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in later stages, in later stages, you get the pester ball.

975
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:39,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Because no one likes a pester ball.

976
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,740
[SPEAKER_07]: We seriously have problems.

977
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob is red in the face.

978
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's from the heat.

979
01:06:47,661 --> 01:06:49,421
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just so excited about the idea.

980
01:06:49,441 --> 01:06:52,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, because I find this immature shit funny.

981
01:06:52,163 --> 01:06:57,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's go back to the root problem, though, here, is this survey.

982
01:06:57,265 --> 01:06:59,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we're being a little bit facetious with this whole stuff here.

983
01:07:00,946 --> 01:07:01,747
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is... I'm not.

984
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:02,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the game.

985
01:07:04,369 --> 01:07:04,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick poll.

986
01:07:05,469 --> 01:07:08,131
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to do an Insta poll right now in Orange Lounge.

987
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:09,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

988
01:07:09,712 --> 01:07:11,373
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see some Y's or N's.

989
01:07:11,974 --> 01:07:13,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you buy what they play Snap?

990
01:07:14,676 --> 01:07:15,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Y or N. Would you play it?

991
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's say the game costs $29.99.

992
01:07:18,498 --> 01:07:19,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you buy it?

993
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:21,480
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's on Nintendo Wii.

994
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:24,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you buy it?

995
01:07:25,103 --> 01:07:25,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Y or N?

996
01:07:25,863 --> 01:07:27,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what makes that the most...

997
01:07:29,661 --> 01:07:38,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Act now, we'll throw in a severed head controller cover for your severed head attachment.

998
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:41,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a severed head camera.

999
01:07:42,073 --> 01:07:45,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in chat said something about this and I thought it was really good.

1000
01:07:46,457 --> 01:07:49,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was RawSteelUT had said something and I lost it here.

1001
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:49,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here it is.

1002
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, this isn't exactly a scientific poll.

1003
01:07:53,162 --> 01:07:55,423
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd get different results on game facts.

1004
01:07:56,144 --> 01:08:01,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does have to do with the audience that was sampled because it was more of a conservative audience.

1005
01:08:01,948 --> 01:08:06,191
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, I mean, doesn't that kind of say something about just society in general?

1006
01:08:06,231 --> 01:08:08,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, maybe this goes beyond gaming a little bit.

1007
01:08:08,232 --> 01:08:09,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Pardon us for getting so deep.

1008
01:08:09,433 --> 01:08:10,614
[SPEAKER_08]: But seriously, guys...

1009
01:08:10,834 --> 01:08:11,515
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

1010
01:08:40,061 --> 01:08:40,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1011
01:08:40,902 --> 01:08:43,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Me personally, I cannot watch the Saw movies.

1012
01:08:43,864 --> 01:08:45,045
[SPEAKER_08]: That level of violence.

1013
01:08:45,065 --> 01:08:46,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched the first one and I was like, that's enough.

1014
01:08:46,926 --> 01:08:48,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard about what's in the other ones.

1015
01:08:48,347 --> 01:08:49,067
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need to see it.

1016
01:08:49,748 --> 01:08:51,689
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to watch it, have fun.

1017
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:53,830
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to see that sick shit, go for it.

1018
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:56,192
[SPEAKER_08]: But for me, I don't want to watch that.

1019
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:58,754
[SPEAKER_08]: There's other things I could watch with my time, like Showgirls.

1020
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:00,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Showgirls is great.

1021
01:09:00,795 --> 01:09:03,337
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the record, I've never seen a Saw movie and never will.

1022
01:09:04,465 --> 01:09:05,406
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1023
01:09:21,451 --> 01:09:21,791
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1024
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:42,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Here are the results of our quick poll.

1025
01:09:42,814 --> 01:09:44,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you buy our game on the Nintendo Wii?

1026
01:09:45,656 --> 01:09:50,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Y, Y, Y, N. Throw the pester ball at the people having sex and they look up at you and say, fuck.

1027
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:59,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y. I'd buy it for my whole Sunday school class.

1028
01:10:01,046 --> 01:10:02,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd buy a Nintendo Wii for it.

1029
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:09,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Y, N, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y in a fucking instant, N, Y.

1030
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:10,753
[SPEAKER_08]: There you have it.

1031
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,995
[SPEAKER_08]: The results of the OLR Quick Poll.

1032
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:16,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting comment as well from Odd1.

1033
01:10:16,377 --> 01:10:18,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Torture porn is just what the name says.

1034
01:10:19,378 --> 01:10:21,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll leave it, but nothing against those who watch it.

1035
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:21,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1036
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:27,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't bloody think that one piece of media is going to completely change a person and destroy whatever moral fiber they might have.

1037
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:30,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And Drew Nami says, case in point, Ichi the Killer.

1038
01:10:31,206 --> 01:10:33,507
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of sick shit out there in movies.

1039
01:10:34,087 --> 01:10:35,828
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to watch it, go for it.

1040
01:10:36,249 --> 01:10:39,611
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, on the other hand, if people want to watch...

1041
01:10:40,948 --> 01:10:45,871
[SPEAKER_08]: If people want to play a game that might involve a sexual component, whatever, right?

1042
01:10:45,931 --> 01:10:47,252
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what warnings are for.

1043
01:10:47,432 --> 01:10:47,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1044
01:10:48,013 --> 01:10:48,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1045
01:10:48,473 --> 01:10:49,453
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what reviews are for.

1046
01:10:49,514 --> 01:10:49,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1047
01:10:50,074 --> 01:10:51,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Read them, you know.

1048
01:10:51,795 --> 01:10:52,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Be educated.

1049
01:10:53,376 --> 01:10:55,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Be a little educated when it comes to purchasing your games?

1050
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,058
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1051
01:10:57,379 --> 01:11:01,141
[SPEAKER_04]: People should just be educated in general and not so freaking head up their ass.

1052
01:11:03,002 --> 01:11:03,582
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think.

1053
01:11:04,523 --> 01:11:05,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your head out of your ass.

1054
01:11:07,023 --> 01:11:07,603
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1055
01:11:36,711 --> 01:11:36,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1056
01:11:37,599 --> 01:11:38,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Legos!

1057
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:41,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Legos aren't really games, but they do make Lego games.

1058
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:46,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the Lego Star Wars games are tons of fun.

1059
01:11:46,895 --> 01:11:53,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there is going to be, by Activision, a Lego Indiana Jones game that's going to be out on the 6th of June.

1060
01:11:54,879 --> 01:12:03,983
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually play as over 60 characters and some of his friends and some of the enemies.

1061
01:12:04,203 --> 01:12:08,846
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually customize your characters by mixing out their parts.

1062
01:12:09,946 --> 01:12:11,367
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like when you play with Legos.

1063
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:13,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have your whip.

1064
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:18,352
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I'm seeing, using the whip is sort of like...

1065
01:12:21,024 --> 01:12:21,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Pitfall.

1066
01:12:22,426 --> 01:12:32,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're saying that you use it to get over gaps and hit switches and you can use it to pick up items in the game to throw at people.

1067
01:12:34,138 --> 01:12:42,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can interact with your environment and you swim and climb and jumping, climbing trees, that type of stuff.

1068
01:12:43,343 --> 01:12:44,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1069
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:11,204
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also coming out in the US and released in North America in June as well.

1070
01:13:11,484 --> 01:13:13,125
[SPEAKER_06]: So around the same time as the movie.

1071
01:13:14,066 --> 01:13:14,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1072
01:13:15,827 --> 01:13:22,693
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be an update coming, well we've been talking about it for a while now, Codename Bogart, which is coming to Burnout Paradise.

1073
01:13:22,753 --> 01:13:35,584
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be basically the next update that they have, hopefully adding this brand new island to race in and going to be part of many different updates that they're going to have for the game.

1074
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:41,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the things that are going to be coming with it, including some bug fixes.

1075
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:51,792
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be identifying the top 10 problems that users have been facing, online functionality, balancing tweaks.

1076
01:13:52,492 --> 01:13:58,135
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be fixing the head-on takedowns, which seemed unfair, I guess, and unrealistic.

1077
01:13:58,895 --> 01:14:01,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfair low-speed takedowns have been removed.

1078
01:14:03,017 --> 01:14:25,759
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they're going to also be of course adding you know the brand new tracks and or portions of the game and hopefully some new cars to download all this is supposed to happen April 24th so I guess a lot to happen in a day yeah and so I guess we'll have to uh stay tuned to see what that is I'm interested in it I'm actually gonna start playing the game again once it comes out but uh

1079
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Only briefly.

1080
01:14:28,342 --> 01:14:30,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Burnout Paradise kind of wore out quick.

1081
01:14:30,784 --> 01:14:32,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I like the open world thing.

1082
01:14:32,566 --> 01:14:34,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I like my Burnout the way it was.

1083
01:14:34,288 --> 01:14:35,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like what they did to it.

1084
01:14:35,629 --> 01:14:36,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the open world.

1085
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:40,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm being so hypocritical because I loved it in test drive.

1086
01:14:40,755 --> 01:14:41,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's why.

1087
01:14:42,256 --> 01:14:44,378
[SPEAKER_08]: When I played Burnout, I was like, I've played this before.

1088
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:45,139
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of grinding.

1089
01:14:45,259 --> 01:14:54,087
[SPEAKER_06]: is what it is, because it's a lot of like, okay, you finished this many races, now you have to do it all over again to get this next license, now you gotta do it all over again.

1090
01:14:54,407 --> 01:15:02,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas like the crash modes and stuff like that of the older games, they provided different scenarios and stuff to play through, whereas this game

1091
01:15:03,235 --> 01:15:13,361
[SPEAKER_06]: You can kind of crash anywhere, but there's only really specific spots that you're going to kind of want to go to where you can get enough points to get to the next license.

1092
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:16,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Burnout Paradise is not the only game that's getting a patch this week.

1093
01:15:17,423 --> 01:15:19,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Lair is also going to be getting a patch very soon.

1094
01:15:20,705 --> 01:15:22,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out in Japan on April 17th.

1095
01:15:22,966 --> 01:15:25,647
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably the same day you're likely to see it everywhere else.

1096
01:15:26,348 --> 01:15:32,371
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest thing that you're getting in this patch, not just Rumble support for the new Rumble controllers coming out, the DualShock 3s, but...

1097
01:15:33,031 --> 01:15:37,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're going to get analog controls, finally.

1098
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:42,458
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to just control with the 6-axis controller.

1099
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:50,464
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a new targeting icon that shows up, and now you can download Wind Dragon and Poison Dragon, the different types of dragons that you can use in any old stage.

1100
01:15:50,804 --> 01:15:55,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if this will change people's opinions on the game, because some of the people's biggest bitch they had was the controls.

1101
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:59,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if they fixed the controls, I'd be really interested to see how the game plays out.

1102
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:04,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see some people, just some, not everybody, but some people that reviewed this game before, like re-review it.

1103
01:16:04,954 --> 01:16:05,514
[SPEAKER_08]: If that makes sense.

1104
01:16:05,754 --> 01:16:06,755
[SPEAKER_06]: They may, actually.

1105
01:16:07,436 --> 01:16:08,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be curious to see that.

1106
01:16:08,756 --> 01:16:12,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is very interesting if a patch has that big of an impact on a game.

1107
01:16:12,599 --> 01:16:13,080
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1108
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:16,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll teach them to stick with the stupid motion controls.

1109
01:16:18,043 --> 01:16:20,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Only, you know, they should have it as an option.

1110
01:16:21,145 --> 01:16:21,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like Rumble.

1111
01:16:22,967 --> 01:16:23,147
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

1112
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,307
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

1113
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:50,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some good news for our friends over in the UK is that one of the retailers, Shop2, has confirmed that they are going to be selling a Grand Theft Auto 4 hardware bundle that will have the 40 gig PS3, 6-axis, and a copy of GTA 4, and it will be out on the 29th of April for £299, which is the equivalent of $590 for us.

1114
01:16:54,998 --> 01:16:55,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1115
01:16:56,218 --> 01:16:58,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Any word on something like that coming over here?

1116
01:16:59,139 --> 01:17:00,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I've seen.

1117
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't work in the industry.

1118
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you surprised, Loki, at the lack?

1119
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know you're big on Grand Theft Auto 4 and this is supposed to be like a system-selling type game.

1120
01:17:09,522 --> 01:17:18,464
[SPEAKER_08]: I have actually heard people thinking of investing in a PlayStation 3 because they want to get Grand Theft Auto and for whatever reason there's more games on the PS3 that interest them as opposed to Xbox 360.

1121
01:17:19,024 --> 01:17:21,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Why isn't Sony jumping on the opportunity over here?

1122
01:17:21,945 --> 01:17:22,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1123
01:17:22,545 --> 01:17:23,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably because...

1124
01:17:23,925 --> 01:17:24,265
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

1125
01:17:44,033 --> 01:17:49,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Really though, they've been having trouble keeping the systems in, I think.

1126
01:17:49,836 --> 01:17:51,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Although we haven't been selling them too fast, I know.

1127
01:17:54,038 --> 01:17:58,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to Fry's the other day and they had pallets of PS3s just sitting there.

1128
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:01,522
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like there's a shortage of them.

1129
01:18:01,582 --> 01:18:04,405
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just people need games to play on it.

1130
01:18:04,865 --> 01:18:07,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Grand Theft Auto will be one of those games.

1131
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:07,948
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be one.

1132
01:18:07,988 --> 01:18:19,297
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll sell systems, but at the same time, I think if people actually realize, hey, there's a lot of games on 360 as well, and it's coming out on there, but

1133
01:18:20,356 --> 01:18:21,397
[SPEAKER_06]: To each his own, I guess.

1134
01:18:21,757 --> 01:18:22,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever their preference is.

1135
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:31,743
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing, though, that's kind of disappointing is the PlayStation Network will be going down tomorrow for about 15 hours.

1136
01:18:33,124 --> 01:18:40,528
[SPEAKER_06]: But not a big deal, because it will be coming back shortly after that with the brand new PlayStation Store.

1137
01:18:41,009 --> 01:18:42,710
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be completely redesigned.

1138
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:45,592
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have a bunch of new features in there as well.

1139
01:18:46,172 --> 01:18:48,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be a little bit easier to browse, kind of like the...

1140
01:18:50,168 --> 01:19:13,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, SingStar store a little bit and some of the cool things that they're going to have on there as well hopefully the home beta will be coming out pretty soon but lots of stuff to look forward to and it's nice to see that they're actually updating their store because it was pretty hard to browse through and this looks a little bit better

1141
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:21,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think the PlayStation Store kind of needed some look and feel changes to it, so I hope this goes well for them.

1142
01:19:21,909 --> 01:19:24,293
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what other store needs look and changes?

1143
01:19:24,553 --> 01:19:29,421
[SPEAKER_06]: That fucking virtual console store needs some serious updates.

1144
01:19:31,161 --> 01:19:37,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, going from hardcore updates and news to big old rumors, take this with a big grain of salt.

1145
01:19:38,204 --> 01:19:41,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, this is coming over from Game Reactor.

1146
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:51,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Some blogger on there has said that apparently John Woo is going to announce the Metroid film at next week's Comic-Con in New York City.

1147
01:19:52,049 --> 01:19:53,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the deal with it.

1148
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:58,912
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to star Christiana Loken, and she was the main actress in Blood Rain, apparently.

1149
01:19:59,492 --> 01:20:00,553
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1150
01:20:22,249 --> 01:20:46,504
[SPEAKER_08]: but he did and he's gotten involved with video games before because there was Stranglehold right was a John Woo game as well so kind of interesting I think the release date makes this false because I think if this were true the movie would already be filming and I don't know that seems like a pretty aggressive release date to just like unless they're gonna like start filming it this summer I guess they could the release date can change I mean it's just go ahead

1151
01:20:48,225 --> 01:20:57,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Also keep in mind that a lot of times, especially for projects that they're going to hype quite a bit and want to actually push out there, that they'll start filming them under a false name.

1152
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:05,694
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, just with the amount of buzz that a game like this would get, I would think that something would leak.

1153
01:21:05,934 --> 01:21:06,374
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1154
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:07,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1155
01:21:09,256 --> 01:21:09,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1156
01:21:09,777 --> 01:21:12,239
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're doing it all on a soundstage, who knows?

1157
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:23,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, all the work that they could be doing right now, could it be maybe going in reverse a little bit, doing a lot of the CG work now, and then going back and then filming the stuff and then adding the CG stuff in there?

1158
01:21:24,068 --> 01:21:24,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1159
01:21:25,649 --> 01:21:26,430
[SPEAKER_03]: There's modeling.

1160
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:31,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just think the special effects that a Metroid movie would take are going to take too long unless they've already been doing them.

1161
01:21:31,885 --> 01:21:36,666
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, if they've already been doing them, some dude on a blog somewhere would not have been the first one to notice this.

1162
01:21:37,086 --> 01:21:39,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it's going to really suck.

1163
01:21:40,407 --> 01:21:41,247
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be sad.

1164
01:21:41,988 --> 01:21:42,848
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be very sad.

1165
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:44,746
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1166
01:22:04,773 --> 01:22:09,715
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura likes to dig through her collection every week and find one game to spotlight for those of you guys pay a little respect to the classic video game of the week

1167
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:35,165
[SPEAKER_08]: So DarkSakura, what classic video game have you selected for the crowd this week?

1168
01:22:35,405 --> 01:22:38,987
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another one that makes my heart hurt that it's considered a classic now.

1169
01:22:40,067 --> 01:22:43,289
[SPEAKER_04]: But it came out on PlayStation and it's Bust a Move.

1170
01:22:43,789 --> 01:22:45,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about Puzzle Bobble.

1171
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:54,694
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out over here as Bust a Groove because Puzzle Bobble came out as Bust a Move already and therefore had the license in the U.S.

1172
01:22:55,695 --> 01:22:57,095
[SPEAKER_04]: But in Japan it was Bust a Move.

1173
01:22:57,396 --> 01:22:58,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take a listen.

1174
01:23:13,331 --> 01:23:15,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever's playing as Kitty Yen is actually doing pretty good.

1175
01:23:15,653 --> 01:23:21,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And the video file that we are playing this from is actually the person playing on the mode with no commands.

1176
01:23:21,276 --> 01:23:23,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you noticed that, Rob.

1177
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:23,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I noticed.

1178
01:23:23,938 --> 01:23:25,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, something's wrong with this when I was looking at it.

1179
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:27,701
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no arrows that you hit in.

1180
01:23:27,981 --> 01:23:31,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's actually when I was at my height of playing this game, I used to play it without commands.

1181
01:23:32,664 --> 01:23:34,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everyone has the same damn moves?

1182
01:23:34,746 --> 01:23:37,748
[SPEAKER_08]: You're probably going to have to explain for our listeners how this is different from DDR.

1183
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:59,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, basically what Bust a Move is, it's sort of a versus dance game where you put in the commands that it brings up on the screen and you do them, you hit your trigger button, I guess I usually call it the trigger, whatever your last command button is, to activate those moves right on the beat.

1184
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:04,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to have good rhythm to make sure that you're hitting this right.

1185
01:24:05,029 --> 01:24:07,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the songs go from...

1186
01:24:07,911 --> 01:24:11,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Super easy to super hard to just being easy and then having tricky parts.

1187
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:13,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this one.

1188
01:24:14,676 --> 01:24:18,399
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, at the very end of this part is where the trickiest part of the song for me is.

1189
01:24:21,521 --> 01:24:33,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you might have just heard where it says high-scoring moves, you actually have secret moves that when it comes up to the character's solo part, if you know what that command is, then you can put in those moves and it boosts your score even more.

1190
01:24:33,389 --> 01:24:33,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1191
01:24:35,651 --> 01:24:37,532
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a bunch of different characters.

1192
01:24:37,552 --> 01:24:38,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It had different songs each.

1193
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:41,235
[SPEAKER_04]: You had different styles.

1194
01:24:41,275 --> 01:24:43,897
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually changed quite a bit, though, when the US version came out.

1195
01:24:43,937 --> 01:24:49,401
[SPEAKER_04]: You had Frida, Gasso, Ham, who was the hamburger guy.

1196
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:50,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought he was great.

1197
01:24:50,362 --> 01:24:53,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Heat, Hiro, who was the disco guy.

1198
01:24:53,604 --> 01:24:55,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Kelly, who was a fetishist.

1199
01:24:56,066 --> 01:24:56,987
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a slut, basically.

1200
01:24:58,374 --> 01:25:01,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Kitty N, Kitty Nakajima Pinky, Stripper Shorty, Strike Burger Dog

1201
01:25:19,841 --> 01:25:32,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Moves, who's in Ham Stage, Capoeira, which were two silver aliens that did Capoeira-style dancing, Columbo, that was Shorty's pet mouse, and Robo-Z, who was actually the boss of the game.

1202
01:25:33,266 --> 01:25:39,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you fight Robo-Z, Robo-Z's like really freaking tall, and you're like maybe the size of a finger.

1203
01:25:40,962 --> 01:25:45,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're actually on top of a building and it's in the middle of the street causing accidents and wrecks.

1204
01:25:46,187 --> 01:25:48,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Capoeira.

1205
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:54,836
[SPEAKER_04]: But Capoeira was also called Kiki and Lala, which I thought was pretty funny.

1206
01:25:55,677 --> 01:26:00,201
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the game came out in the US, they... See, this is the good version, if we can turn it up a little bit.

1207
01:26:07,103 --> 01:26:10,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is, they made this song in English and it sucked.

1208
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:13,329
[SPEAKER_04]: The woman could not sing for crap.

1209
01:26:13,509 --> 01:26:16,232
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually did, they edited it quite a bit.

1210
01:26:16,272 --> 01:26:18,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, when Strike comes out, he would drink from a flask.

1211
01:26:19,835 --> 01:26:23,178
[SPEAKER_04]: And they changed it to a can of Coke.

1212
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:24,540
[SPEAKER_04]: They took out Hero's Cigarette.

1213
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:28,604
[SPEAKER_04]: They changed certain lyrics for being, I guess, racially charged.

1214
01:26:28,664 --> 01:26:31,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And also references to McDonald's and Burger King.

1215
01:26:32,607 --> 01:26:37,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they, like I said, they did some of the songs in English, which just was awful.

1216
01:26:38,114 --> 01:26:38,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1217
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:40,817
[SPEAKER_04]: They left Fridas in Japanese, which I don't understand.

1218
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:43,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then, um...

1219
01:26:46,685 --> 01:27:00,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, with the stages, though, is that if you did a seven-point combo, which, you know, that was getting up to the most difficult stage of doing those special combos, you could get the levels to do, like, neat stuff.

1220
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:06,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for this stage here, Capoeira stage, the doors would pop off, and you'd either be in the air or you'd be in outer space, depending.

1221
01:27:08,173 --> 01:27:11,835
[SPEAKER_04]: If you play shorty and pull one off, her mouse jumps out of her pocket and starts dancing with her.

1222
01:27:12,955 --> 01:27:19,840
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is so... It's just really one of my... Okay, I first played this when someone brought over their copy.

1223
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: It had only been like a week in Japan.

1224
01:27:22,882 --> 01:27:25,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And I imported it as soon as Payday hit.

1225
01:27:27,085 --> 01:27:32,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this bugs you when I call it this, but Bust a Move 2 was my first rhythm game ever here in the U.S.

1226
01:27:33,429 --> 01:27:37,572
[SPEAKER_08]: And without that game, I probably would not be here on Orange Lounge Radio today.

1227
01:27:37,732 --> 01:27:40,174
[SPEAKER_08]: So I totally love this series as well.

1228
01:27:40,942 --> 01:28:02,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Best of Move 2 and the reason why I'm not really combining them is because actually Best of Move 2 to me is sort of a different game because each character had their own set of special commands instead of having everyone having the same move which is why you can play Best of Move in

1229
01:28:04,918 --> 01:28:07,339
[SPEAKER_04]: without the commands because everybody had the same damn commands.

1230
01:28:07,819 --> 01:28:11,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually had one of the first English fan sites on this game and it's gone.

1231
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:20,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been dead, but the link is still on the anime web turnpike if that's any indication of how long I've had that site.

1232
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:21,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Fever time.

1233
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:21,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1234
01:28:21,943 --> 01:28:24,304
[SPEAKER_08]: When a new character does really well, they get to bust out a solo.

1235
01:28:24,324 --> 01:28:24,924
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty awesome.

1236
01:28:25,524 --> 01:28:26,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And the endings are funny too.

1237
01:28:27,505 --> 01:28:30,967
[SPEAKER_04]: But Busted Move 2 had individual moves for everybody.

1238
01:28:30,987 --> 01:28:35,910
[SPEAKER_04]: It had easy mode, which it was all just using commands with the arrows.

1239
01:28:36,330 --> 01:28:39,973
[SPEAKER_04]: You had the medium mode, which plays pretty much just like the first Busted Move.

1240
01:28:39,993 --> 01:28:43,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you had mix mode, which uses the triangle score and everything.

1241
01:28:43,695 --> 01:28:48,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And you also had attacks too, which if you timed your attack just right, you could completely botch their entire solo.

1242
01:28:49,978 --> 01:28:54,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, really quickly here, before we go to break, because we've got to kind of wrap this segment up, why do you think this series kind of died off?

1243
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:59,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, we had these games, we had Dance Summit, which was kind of meh.

1244
01:28:59,402 --> 01:29:00,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Dance Summit!

1245
01:29:00,782 --> 01:29:02,683
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it wasn't really the same.

1246
01:29:03,063 --> 01:29:08,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did this series, why haven't we seen more games in this series, especially with how popular music games have been in this day and age?

1247
01:29:09,249 --> 01:29:10,190
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1248
01:29:27,611 --> 01:29:28,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1249
01:29:48,944 --> 01:29:55,966
[SPEAKER_04]: They really tried to innovate the series, and I thought that Buster Move 2 was going in the right direction, but they haven't done anything else with it.

1250
01:29:56,006 --> 01:30:02,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that maybe because of how poorly Dance Summit did, that maybe they thought that it was just time to end the series.

1251
01:30:03,009 --> 01:30:03,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1252
01:30:03,649 --> 01:30:03,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Sad.

1253
01:30:04,449 --> 01:30:09,511
[SPEAKER_04]: But what they need to do is go back and do another one that plays like Buster Move 2.

1254
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we gotta wrap up, but that is your classic game of the week, folks.

1255
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,232
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Bust a Move.

1256
01:30:16,292 --> 01:30:19,039
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you not like a game that has a gigantic voguing robot?

1257
01:30:19,485 --> 01:30:20,166
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1258
01:30:41,823 --> 01:30:42,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that is true.

1259
01:30:43,226 --> 01:30:46,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quickly, Qualtipo in chat asked, what could they put in a Buster Groove sequel?

1260
01:30:47,274 --> 01:30:50,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, just more of the same on next gen.

1261
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:51,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Online, Xbox Live.

1262
01:30:51,783 --> 01:30:53,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Get rid of bio, bring back gaso.

1263
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:58,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a great Xbox... What a great Xbox Live Arcade game this might make.

1264
01:30:58,404 --> 01:30:59,204
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that would be good.

1265
01:30:59,285 --> 01:31:00,785
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what they should have, I think?

1266
01:31:01,446 --> 01:31:10,570
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have... You know, you can do creative mode... You know, in wrestling games, you can do create a wrestler and customize all of their moves, every single one based on what you put.

1267
01:31:10,691 --> 01:31:18,495
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do is have a creative dancer mode and you'd give them different combo moves or give them a style of dance and...

1268
01:31:19,175 --> 01:31:19,395
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1269
01:31:28,464 --> 01:31:29,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that should come out.

1270
01:31:30,324 --> 01:31:31,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Another dream game!

1271
01:31:53,837 --> 01:31:57,159
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we are going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1272
01:31:57,619 --> 01:32:00,981
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do a quick break, and we're going to come back with Part B of our podcast.

1273
01:32:01,001 --> 01:32:08,906
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you guys listening to us live on allgames.com, you're going to get just a little bit of music, and we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1274
01:32:08,986 --> 01:32:10,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay tuned.

1275
01:32:10,767 --> 01:32:15,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1276
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:20,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
