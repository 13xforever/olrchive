00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,780
Tonight April 13, 2008, Brazil bans a popular video game, could BBC show soon be coming

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,440
to the Nintendo Wii?

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,440
And we interview Fards, the creator of Rom Check Fail.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,440
This is Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,520
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,520
Radio.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,040
A very special week for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,000
That's right, it's the first week of us live and exclusive on AllGames.com.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,340
The old chapter of our Orange Lounge Radio feed on Live 365 closed as of yesterday and

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,600
now we're on our new home at AllGames.com so a big hello to all of our new live listeners

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,720
that we've got over at AllGames.com and hello to those of you still joining us, be it through

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,520
the podcast feed or our old OLR faithful or what be you.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,280
Remember, you can always join our chat room to interact with the show.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,400
Just a quick footnote for the live folks, it is a different chat room than AllGames

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
usually uses.

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,520
You're going to want to head over to chat.orangeloungeradio.com or if you're already on the Game Surge

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,440
Network, you're going to want to use channel Orange Lounge.

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,260
Alright let's go ahead and introduce the cast.

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,100
My name is Rob Roberts but joining me as always, say hello to talk to me about the gaming news

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,720
and make fun of it, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
Hi.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
When it deserves to be made fun of, correct?

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Or even when it doesn't.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Alright, sounds good.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,280
I'm an equal opportunity make fun of her.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Sounds good.

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
How are you doing, DarkSakura?

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
Meaty.

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Alright.

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
I'm meaty today.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,280
Did you get your pastrami today?

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
I have my pastrami.

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,540
I have the ferret too.

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,760
Very nice.

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,000
Too much to Bobby's dismay, you do have the ferret here in the studio with us joining

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
us.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hello.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How you doing, Loki?

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Alright.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,600
And you're full of pizza, if I'm not mistaken.

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,440
Uh, yeah, breadsticks and stuff.

44
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,800
Yeah, when you came walking up to the door you had like two pizza boxes, I'm like damn

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Loki, you're fat.

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,400
Fat with a pH, Loki.

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
You know I love ya.

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,960
But no, it was one pizza and one thing of breadsticks.

49
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,000
By the way, we here at OLR, for those of you on all games who haven't heard our show before,

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,280
we like food almost as much as we like video games.

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
So there you have it.

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,200
I especially like video games about food.

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
Like cooking mama.

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,920
You know how some people say that they like to, you know, watch porn while they do it?

55
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,020
I like to eat food while I'm playing video games about food.

56
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,600
So while you're like playing cooking mama, do you actually cook things that you're cooking

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
in cooking mama?

58
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,400
No, however, it did inspire me to try to make one of the dishes once.

59
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,700
We should try that one night.

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,960
We should do some, you know, cooking mama, like for reals.

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,040
The instructions in that game are actually semi-realistic, given that those are, a lot

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,320
of those dishes are stuff I make anyway, because I'm an awesome cook.

63
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
And so humble.

64
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,320
I know, I am, but it's the same type of thing, you know, the same situation, you know, to

65
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,840
watch something and then, you know, participate, sort of.

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, we have a cooking mama related story tonight as well.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We do.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,640
Sort of, distantly, but it is a cooking mama related thing.

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,720
We'll get into that later.

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,260
Also tonight we have Farbz, but you know him as the man behind Rom Check Fail, which was

71
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,260
written by one man.

72
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,080
We'll tell you more about that a little bit later on in the program.

73
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,400
Also, we're live and streaming on Justin TV, if you want to see our ugly mugs on the cam.

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,200
We're over there at Justin TV, Orange Lounge Radio.

75
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,080
But we're going to start off tonight's show as we always do, talking a little bit about

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
our gaming weeks.

77
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,960
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,440
It was meaty, no.

79
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
So meaty.

80
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,560
Now, my gaming week was actually, I know I always say it's pinball oriented, but this

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,160
week was especially pinball oriented.

82
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,680
Because Dan is hosting his pinball group gathering tonight.

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,940
Hence another reason why I, you know, feel very blessed to be here tonight.

84
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,600
So I had to be around loud stranger men that I don't know.

85
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Anyway, so a lot of the week was actually spent testing out after shopping out some

86
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,960
of the tables.

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,480
We've had his friend Will's Judge Dredd torn apart all over our garage right now and they

88
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,240
just put it back together today and I hate that table.

89
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:29,440
Anyway, we also went to one of our local used movie CD places called Dimple and we almost

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,720
picked up some 7800 games.

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,440
But then we remembered that we probably already owned them.

92
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,960
Because the way you know that you have too much in your collection is when you have to

93
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,160
actually stop and ask yourself, do I own this or even worse, how many copies of this do

94
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,320
I already have?

95
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,880
I've come home with a game for Dan and now the unique thing about it is that I did have

96
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
the manual in the box.

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,160
It's a 5200 game.

98
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,560
We had three other copies of it.

99
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,400
You need to get one of those little personal organizers just for your video game collection

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,220
so you can actually pull up an Excel spreadsheet on the go.

101
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,640
Do I have this game?

102
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,920
Does it have the manual with it?

103
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Yes or no?

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,820
That's a pretty hardcore video game collector.

105
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,200
We actually did have a list like that for a while and then I think we lost it in a computer

106
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,760
crash and then we just were sort of like, you've seen our vault.

107
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:29,240
We have an entire room dedicated to the collection and it's sort of overwhelming now.

108
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Actually a lot overwhelming.

109
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,120
Have you ever thought like, one of these days we just need to get rid of this shit.

110
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,200
We need to call the 1-800 got junk people or whatever it is.

111
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Bite your tongue.

112
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Ow.

113
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
It has been bitten.

114
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,560
Dan has said that we should get rid of some of it and I'm like, you touch that collection

115
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:52,000
I kill you and then when you're dead it's all mine.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,520
He'll divorce him when he's dead and then take over the collection.

117
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,800
Well when he's dead I'm actually putting him in his Mustang driving it off a cliff and

118
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,240
exploding it in mid-air.

119
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
That's what he wants.

120
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,000
I am the best wife ever.

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,640
Something tells me you're out of video games to talk about so we're going to move over

122
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,960
to, now she's like talking about these Thelma and Louise inspired things, I don't know,

123
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
so we're going to go over.

124
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
What's this idea?

125
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Loki.

126
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,520
Do I want to buy a Virtual Boy system?

127
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
That's what I need to know.

128
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,400
Yes, you do want a Virtual Boy system.

129
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,560
How much do they want for it?

130
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
$75.

131
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,200
No, actually wait I'm sorry I read that wrong.

132
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,600
I would be about $84.

133
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,760
Is that something you're looking at on eBay right now or something?

134
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Yes.

135
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,960
Well now that you just said that on air everybody else is going to go look that up and jack

136
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
the price up.

137
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Let's buy it now.

138
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Oh, buy it now.

139
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,560
I don't know, it's a piece of gaming history.

140
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,800
I have the Vectrex too and I can't turn it, see I want a game system that I can leave

141
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,240
running on my desk all day long so people can come and play it but the Vectrex makes

142
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,720
it really loud like the entire time that it's going so that and there's no real like demo

143
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,560
loop or anything it just keeps playing the game over and over until you actually touch

144
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
it.

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Isn't that a demo loop?

146
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,800
No, because you have to play in other words you keep dying because there's no demo loop

147
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,940
but.

148
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,360
Have you ever thought of actually just like building like a mock cabinet and having to

149
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,720
something that cycles like an emulator?

150
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,360
No, I don't want to build a cabinet for my desk because I think they'd be like what the

151
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
hell's that?

152
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
In the office.

153
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,040
It's my new arcade cabinet.

154
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Don't touch my arcade cabinet.

155
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,600
No, but actually stuff that I played this week.

156
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,160
I was going to say, you know, we here on Orange Launch Radio, we like to stay on the current

157
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,200
news too, not just, you know, Virtual Boys and Atari 7800s, have you been playing like

158
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,280
360, Wii, any of that stuff?

159
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,960
This week I've only played two things, unfortunately.

160
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,420
First one of course is multiplayer Saints Rokes.

161
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,400
We're still playing that damn game until we can get Grand Theft Auto IV, which I did find

162
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,760
out today, well not today, but earlier this week that my boss is going to buy me a special

163
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,640
edition of Grand Theft Auto IV, so that's awesome, but at the same time I already preordered

164
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,940
another one just because, you know, we're going to need some for multiplayer.

165
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,640
And I think I need about two to three more copies on top of those too, so five somewhere

166
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
around there.

167
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,280
That reminds me I still have to fix my other 360.

168
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:23,320
And then, other than Saints Row, I did play Mario Kart Wii, a lot of Mario Kart Wii, in

169
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:32,600
fact I've already finished 50cc and 100cc, of course imported from the UK.

170
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,040
And well, what can I say about the game, it's Mario Kart.

171
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,560
I like some of the new levels that are in there, I think they're really cool.

172
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,760
The only thing that, a couple gripes I have about the game, some of the levels that they

173
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,840
chose, like the classic levels, are kind of stupid choices.

174
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,600
They're not, well Rainbow Road's kind of annoying, but you know, that's just Rainbow Road, but

175
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,480
a lot of the like, especially even the battle modes, like the battle courses that they chose

176
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,220
are just kind of crappy.

177
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,800
Which Rainbow Road did they bring over?

178
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,480
They have the new Rainbow Road, there is no older one.

179
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
And it's annoying.

180
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,360
Well Rainbow Road always is.

181
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,280
No, but like some of the battle courses that they brought over, they brought over like,

182
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know, just some of the lamest ones from the other games.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,880
And I really think they could have chose some better tracks as well from like the classic

184
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
stuff.

185
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,720
Because there's a lot that just kind of resemble other tracks in the game that are already

186
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
there.

187
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,320
I mean there's three tracks that are kind of like the Donkey Kong, what was it, the

188
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,640
one from Double Dash.

189
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,680
They're kind of like that, where you have the giant cannon that launches you to the

190
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,680
top of the track and you race down back to the cannon and stuff.

191
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
So it's alright.

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,280
Some other weird gripes about it.

193
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,440
Battle mode is only team based.

194
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,640
You cannot play against, you know, individual people.

195
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
What?

196
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Yeah.

197
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,760
You can only play against, you have to be on one team or the other.

198
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,560
So if you have three people or four people and you want to battle each other, well you

199
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
can't.

200
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,360
You have to be on two man teams.

201
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
That sucks.

202
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Yeah, it's retarded.

203
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
I wonder why they did that.

204
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,920
You would think that's something that, you know, doesn't take a whole lot of extra programming.

205
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Oh yeah.

206
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
It's lazy.

207
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
That's all it is.

208
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Interesting.

209
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
That's a weird change.

210
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Yeah.

211
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
So that sucks.

212
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,600
Other than that though, you can customize a lot of stuff in there, like different item

213
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
drops.

214
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,860
But, you know, I tried some of the ones that drop like the really supposedly big items,

215
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,440
like the more powerful items more frequently versus the normal drops and I didn't notice

216
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
a difference.

217
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,600
So I don't know.

218
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,400
It's not very useful.

219
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,480
But tried online a little bit.

220
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,400
I was hardly able to get into any games right now.

221
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,440
Online is kind of crappy as far as connecting to a game, but once you're in the game, it's

222
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,720
fine.

223
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,680
I like the way that they have it where you pick courses and stuff.

224
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,000
You basically choose a course that you want, then the computer randomly selects which player's

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,620
choice gets picked and stuff.

226
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,620
So that's kind of neat.

227
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,680
Now obviously you have no friends to play against right now, right?

228
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
So you're just playing the...

229
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,860
I'm just playing against random people worldwide.

230
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
And it's working okay?

231
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm surprised there's enough people on there.

232
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
But I guess since the game's...

233
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
No, there's a ton of people on there.

234
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,800
Since the game's out in the UK and stuff.

235
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,040
It's out in the UK and Japan already.

236
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,800
Two-thirds of the world has it, but just not the US yet.

237
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
But yeah, it's okay.

238
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,520
I'm not very good at...

239
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:25,960
I like playing as Yoshi or the medium karts, so it's not very fast and I get beat pretty

240
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,360
quick sometimes.

241
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,000
But I like the tracks.

242
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,480
Some of the meat integration in the game is pretty funny, especially there's a mall level

243
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
that you play in.

244
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,240
And there's a bunch of signs and stuff that are all throughout the mall with different

245
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Miis on there.

246
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
And it's randomly selected each time you play the game.

247
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,200
So there was one that I was driving through the very first time I played at the mall.

248
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,560
My Chuck Norris Mii was on the coffee.

249
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
There's a coffee advertisement.

250
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,320
And then there's another one with Jesus on there.

251
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,080
And then later on in the level you saw Hitler driving a car and stuff.

252
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,880
Just absolutely funny stuff.

253
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Nice.

254
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,480
And there's Goat Say Mii driving a car one time, but for some reason it likes selecting

255
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,360
Saddam and Hitler Miis.

256
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,280
I don't know why, but I see them the most frequent.

257
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,600
Did you get the Bobby Black Wolf Mii to show up at some point?

258
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,760
Like, you know, Saddam, Hitler, and Bobby Black Wolf all driving cars with the Goat

259
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Say?

260
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Goat Say Man?

261
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,560
You know, he might have been in there somewhere, but I don't remember exactly what his Mii

262
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,960
looks like, so I have to see.

263
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,080
It looks like him, dummy!

264
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,040
Well, I know it looks like him, duh, but I have a ton of Miis and, you know, they all

265
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,160
kind of look similar to different things, so, you know, it's hard to pick out.

266
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,560
I'm like, is that Rob, or is that Shane?

267
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,880
I'm not sure, you know.

268
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,520
Well, let's get this thing.

269
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,200
Shane, black hair, Rob, reddish-brown hair.

270
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
It's not that hard.

271
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Well, you're driving my stuff really fast, okay?

272
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,120
You can't just, like, stop and, like, hmm.

273
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,120
I think that my Mii is very recognizable, but then again she's also scowling.

274
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah, yeah.

275
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I love Dark Soccer's Mii.

276
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Her Mii was in a car one time, so that was funny.

277
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,760
Dark Soccer's Mii always looks angry, because she picked the little pointy eyebrows to make

278
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,560
her look mad all the time, which is great.

279
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,800
So yeah, you can play the game, and then eventually you unlock the Mii, the drive S, which, here's

280
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,200
my other gripe, and I haven't, I could be wrong about this, but I haven't tried multiplayer

281
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,120
with it yet.

282
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,960
In single player, when you're playing as the Mii character, you can't select which Mii

283
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
it uses.

284
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,400
It's only the one that you assign to your license.

285
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,840
So you can't swap it between other things, which is another lazy thing that they've done.

286
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,360
And it also has the most retarded voice I've ever heard for a character.

287
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,240
It's like a retarded Mario voice.

288
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,800
It's like, ehhhhh.

289
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,980
It's like, what the hell is that?

290
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,880
It sounds like goat boy Mii or something.

291
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,120
What the hell is that?

292
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
I don't know, but hopefully...

293
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Can you make that sound again for us?

294
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Ehhhhh.

295
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
There you go.

296
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,920
So I don't know.

297
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
I like the game.

298
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,440
I like it a lot better than Smash Brothers, but I love Mario Kart, so what can I say?

299
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,360
Well Bobby is in chat right now at chat.orangelaundry.com, defending himself a little bit.

300
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,280
We'll let him have the first comment on allgames.com, because he is the show that precedes us after

301
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,640
all over on allgames.com, Bobby Black Wolf Show, which starts an hour before we do here

302
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
on allgames.com.

303
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,560
He says, my Mii looks like Jesus to some people, so maybe when you were driving by really fast,

304
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,880
what actually you thought was Jesus was just Bobby.

305
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
It could have been.

306
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Possibly.

307
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,720
Looking at some other comments, some folks were talking about Mario Kart Double Dash,

308
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,040
because not everybody's played Mario Kart Wii yet, obviously, so it's been inspiring

309
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,160
some talk about Mario Kart Double Dash, and Osfer speaking up for Double Dash, saying

310
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,080
Double Dash was some fun shit, and Sephiroth1215 saying, yeah, see, I really don't understand

311
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,600
why people don't like Double Dash.

312
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
It was okay.

313
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
It's just, okay.

314
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,480
The thing I didn't like about Double Dash is the battle mode really sucked.

315
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
Like the levels that they made for it just awful.

316
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,880
And even some of the levels in, oh that's the other thing too about, and I, you know,

317
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,920
I don't remember the other Mario games too well, the Mario Kart games, but from what

318
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,440
I remember before, you didn't have a point limit or a time limit, so in the battle mode

319
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,000
this time, you have a three minute time limit for each game that you play.

320
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,280
You can't just keep playing until, you know, someone loses, which is kind of lame.

321
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,280
And when you lose all your balloons, you just get them all back, and it just keeps counting

322
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,440
more scores, so the balloons are kind of pointless too.

323
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Interesting.

324
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Yeah.

325
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,440
But I like what they've done with the levels, like where you can go up like half pipes almost

326
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,560
and do tricks and stuff.

327
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,740
That's pretty cool.

328
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,100
And there are some, you know, neat things.

329
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,560
The motorcycles I don't really dig very much.

330
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,720
I think that's kind of a dumb addition, and I tried playing it the steering wheel method,

331
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
and I hate it.

332
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
It's awful.

333
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,240
But the good news is though, for those that may have heard different stories claiming

334
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,600
otherwise, the classic controller and the GameCube controller are not gimped in any

335
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,320
way whatsoever, so you can play them just fine with it.

336
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Really?

337
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
In fact, I use the classic controller.

338
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,200
But I mentioned there's got to be a huge difference between using an analog stick to control something

339
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
and using the motion.

340
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,400
There's got to be a huge difference.

341
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Yeah.

342
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
I don't like the motion at all.

343
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Interesting.

344
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,400
And doing all the gestures that do different things, it's not very fun, so I prefer the

345
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,920
classic controller of the GameCube.

346
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,520
Okay, so to kind of sum up this game review here that you're ending up giving us on Mario

347
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Kart Wii, what would you say?

348
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,120
Is it better than Double Dash?

349
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,840
Are fans of Mario Kart going to like it?

350
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Do you recommend it?

351
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, I'd say it's better than Double Dash because it doesn't have two characters anymore

352
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,160
and that kind of is stupid in the first place.

353
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,720
And they killed Toadette off, hopefully.

354
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Yeah, I think so.

355
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
I can't stand Toadette.

356
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Toadette sucks.

357
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,920
Definitely, if you like Mario Kart, you're going to like this game.

358
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,760
The fact that it has online is going to be pretty cool.

359
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,040
There has been some cheating online, but we'll get into that a little bit later.

360
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,500
Thankfully they fixed that.

361
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,520
But I don't know, overall it's a pretty cool game.

362
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,040
I just wish there were some better tracks.

363
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,640
Some of the classic tracks that they picked were kind of stupid.

364
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,900
Just like kind of, well this track's easy, the remake, so let's just pick this one instead

365
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,880
of actually picking good tracks.

366
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,840
That's my only gripe.

367
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,240
But other than that, it is an awesome game.

368
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Alright.

369
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,920
Well, moving on to my gaming week, I was just bitching at Loki for talking about classics

370
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,080
too much, but that's actually kind of what I ended up playing this week because if you

371
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,000
were listening last week, you know I've been sick for a little while now and I was actually

372
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,880
at my parents' house this week recovering.

373
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,920
And so there are no video games in my parents' place and I lost my freaking DS charger.

374
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
And here's the weird thing.

375
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Do you know that Target and Walmart, both those stores, they do not carry DS chargers.

376
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,360
They carry the car chargers, but they don't carry the ones you can plug in the wall.

377
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,800
And I wasn't able to convince them to take me over to a GameStop or whatever, so I was

378
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,760
just like, alright, so I'm just gonna, I guess, watch TV.

379
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,480
And then it dawned on me, even though my parents, they only have a 56.6K dial-up connection

380
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
to the internet.

381
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,960
Oh my god, so slow.

382
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,340
When you're spoiled with broadband.

383
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,480
But they have the 56.6K connection to the internet.

384
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,840
I downloaded emulators.

385
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,680
And so I went to town on some Super Nintendo games I'd missed and the one I probably played

386
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
the most of was Soul Blazer.

387
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,960
I don't know if you guys remember this game at all.

388
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,800
It was kind of in that same series-ish that Illusion of Gaia and Terranigma and some of

389
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
these other games were.

390
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
I remember.

391
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,320
Soul Blazer was like the first in that game by Enix, you know, way back in the day.

392
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,560
Basically you could kind of call it a Zelda-ish type of game.

393
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,800
You go in these action stages and as you kill these monsters that come out of the lair,

394
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,480
you free souls that might unlock something in the town.

395
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,920
But the towns and the dungeons are sort of related.

396
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,600
So like, you know, like in the dungeon, for instance, there's one part where an elevator

397
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,840
is broken and it doesn't work.

398
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,920
Well you have to release the soul of the man who runs the water well to get him to start

399
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,400
the water well again so the elevator works.

400
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,740
There's weird little connections like that.

401
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,820
But the game has a surprising amount of depth to it with the story for a Super Nintendo

402
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
game.

403
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm reviewing a classic, but it is one of my all-time favorite Super Nintendo games.

404
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,480
Because in the story, the hero can talk to, he's kind of like a servant of God, quote

405
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,960
unquote, whatever you want to call it, and he can talk to dogs and cats and goats and

406
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,080
plants the same way that he talks to humans.

407
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
So it's very interesting the way they've written the story.

408
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Do you know the cleric?

409
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,880
Sort of, but I don't think that's what he's called in the game.

410
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,920
He's just a hero is what he's called.

411
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
He's a goat whisperer.

412
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,960
Well in my game, he was called Butters because you can name him whatever you want, so I named

413
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,160
him Butters because I like that name.

414
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,480
So yeah, so I played a lot of Soul Blazer this week.

415
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,680
And otherwise, as far as newer games go, I went back to an MMO this week that I haven't

416
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
played in a while.

417
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,600
I hope it's not Final Fantasy XI.

418
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,720
It is not Final Fantasy XI.

419
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,000
But you would still be surprised.

420
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,240
You know what MMO I played this week that I haven't played?

421
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
PSN Blue Burst?

422
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Close.

423
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Phantasy Star Universe.

424
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Julie said she saw you on.

425
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,680
Yep, I played Phantasy Star Universe for a little while.

426
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,200
She came over to show me the free server she's playing on for Blue Burst.

427
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,700
Sega apparently is cool with people being on the free servers now and has character

428
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
transfer tools.

429
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,400
Dang, that's kind of rad.

430
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Yeah.

431
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
That's nice of them.

432
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,320
But she said she saw you on.

433
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
Yes.

434
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Rob's playing PSU again?

435
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Cool.

436
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
I need to play with him.

437
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,040
I actually downloaded the expansion, the Ambition of the Illuminous, or whatever it's called.

438
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,480
I've always jokingly called it the abortion of the Illuminous.

439
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Well not on Xbox 360.

440
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
You can't get it.

441
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Really?

442
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
I could have gotten it free for free.

443
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Alright, that's alright.

444
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,360
I got it anyway.

445
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,240
I haven't gotten to explore it a whole lot, but I will say this.

446
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,320
I've kind of enjoyed the way that the online story, because the game's changed a lot since

447
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,440
I last, because I played for about a month after it first came out, and then I just stopped

448
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
because I was kind of getting old.

449
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,480
It felt like the same grind over and over, but they've really expanded a story that begins

450
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,320
on the disc of the game, Phantasy Star Universe, is this very anime style story with this grand

451
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,840
introduction and everything.

452
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,040
The neat thing about PSU is that it keeps expanding the story on in the online mode,

453
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,680
so you literally start chapter two or the second series online, and it's a continuation

454
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,840
of the first series.

455
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,900
And then this whole Ambition of the Illuminous is the third series, and it even comes with

456
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,000
its own cutscenes, new introduction, and all this other cool stuff.

457
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,160
So I thought it was kind of interesting.

458
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,160
I have not yet though gotten the mag and all this other stuff that supposedly PSU is bringing

459
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,840
back some of the old school stuff from Phantasy Star Online, but I'm not that far enough yet.

460
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,880
They've got the original four stages too.

461
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,280
I know that the people that are probably, if you're looking to play this game and you

462
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,040
haven't done it yet, it's like 20 bucks now.

463
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
It's very cheap.

464
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,360
And Rob, kaths can use four skills now.

465
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,680
It's about time.

466
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,320
Speaking of crack that I used to be on gaming-wise, speaking of Final Fantasy XI as well, I also

467
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,960
noticed, I didn't realize this came out, there's a new combo disc that came out for the Xbox

468
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,720
360 that combines Final Fantasy XI and every single expansion, including the new Wings

469
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
of the Goddess, only $29.99 on Xbox 360.

470
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,200
Not too bad of a deal, I got to say, if you want to get sucked into that crack.

471
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,680
So you have several MMO crack things to choose from on the Xbox 360.

472
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,400
All right, that's going to do it for our gaming week.

473
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,640
That was quite a bit tonight, but we had a lot of games to talk about.

474
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
Let's talk about some housekeeping news.

475
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,720
Of course, last night the plug was pulled on our Live 365 feed.

476
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,880
It's no longer there.

477
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,920
Gaming and Live 365, oh my god.

478
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,520
I wrote them a cancellation email a week ago.

479
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
You're supposed to give them three business days to cancel, right?

480
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,680
I wrote them an email a week ago, no response.

481
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,760
Wrote them a second notice, like Thursday or Friday, no response.

482
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,400
Guess who charged my card today?

483
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
The butt heads.

484
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,880
This is a fun ever start.

485
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,160
I'll keep you guys posted next week, what happens with that?

486
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,040
We might have to get nasty if things keep going down this route, because essentially

487
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,880
they've taken money from me that I didn't pay for.

488
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,400
It's kind of pissing me off.

489
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,260
Call your bank and stop payment.

490
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,720
So hello to AllGames.com, our new home, which has deducted no money from my bank account

491
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,700
this week, thankfully, because there are great people over at AllGames.com who aren't sucking

492
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,480
my money away, and they're friends, and we definitely urge you to check out the programming

493
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,900
that's at AllGames.com.

494
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,920
They have something new every night.

495
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,200
They re-air a bunch of podcasts that go on throughout the week.

496
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,840
Some of them have their debut on All Games Radio, so check that out.

497
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,760
We debut, of course, Sunday nights before us, Bobby Black Wolf.

498
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,520
In the morning times, All Games Interactive is on like every day, Monday through Friday.

499
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,200
So that shows on, I think, like 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and they go through most of the morning,

500
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,240
which would be actually early afternoon for the East Coast folks, so it really works out

501
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,400
great for the East Coast folks who have to stay up really late to listen to us.

502
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,080
And again, we want to remind you, we have a special guest tonight, Farbz of Romcheck

503
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,080
Fail fame, and if you like Orange Lounge Radio, you want to get to know us a little better,

504
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,000
join our social networking.

505
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's right.

506
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,320
We're MySpace whores just like everybody else, and Facebook and all that other stuff.

507
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,080
Our MySpace is MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

508
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,560
We also have a live journal community at Orange Lounge, no radio, and Facebook.

509
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,880
Just search for OL Army, and you can add us on all those sites, and stay tuned with all

510
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,140
the news, and when we shift networks and all that stuff, you'll be on top of things and

511
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
know where to catch us.

512
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,920
Apparently, the chat room is loving the new sound, by the way, because our feed now is

513
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:56,920
96k, so it's a lot clearer, the feed, than the 64k we were on with Live 365, so they're

514
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,200
really happy with that.

515
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,600
And I think our podcast listeners are going to notice we also changed the audio on the

516
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,360
podcast to be similar to what we're broadcasting at now, so it's going to be a whole new sound.

517
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
That's okay, Rob.

518
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
I'll just talk like this.

519
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,360
We'll ruin the audio quality of the show this way.

520
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Yeah, we'll just do it this way.

521
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,000
Alright, how about you get into some great new news tonight, will ya, ladies and gentlemen?

522
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,120
Anyways, let's see.

523
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:26,600
So this week, the publisher of Famitsu Magazine thinks that they have an idea of what may

524
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,200
be happening in E3 this year, one of the announcements.

525
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Their guess is that Nintendo is going to be announcing yet another revision of the DS,

526
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,720
and their thinking behind this is because the timing seems to be right.

527
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,440
Apparently, every two years or so is when they revise their portable systems.

528
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:56,540
So for example, there is the 1996 Game Boy Pocket, and then in 98 there was the Game

529
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,640
Boy Color, and then of course in 2001 there was the Game Boy Advance, in 2003 there was

530
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:09,600
the Game Boy Advance SP, in 2004 there was DS, and then in 2006 there was DS Lite, so

531
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:16,360
2008, obviously since the DS is doing extremely well, they wouldn't probably introduce a new

532
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,440
system, but maybe another revision, maybe a yet slimmer and something with storage that

533
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,080
could possibly download something off the Virtual Console or something like that.

534
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,640
The DS Micro.

535
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Who knows?

536
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,520
Or maybe they'll just do nothing and won't they feel stupid.

537
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,960
Okay, so in other words, Famitsu Magazine is basically saying this, Nintendo likes to

538
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,640
redo shit and make you buy it all over again, all the time.

539
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,680
So 2008 will be nothing new, is essentially what they're saying, and this is news how?

540
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,680
I don't know.

541
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:54,680
It's news because, I don't know, because we're talking about E3, and people like talking

542
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
about E3.

543
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,520
Odd1 says, but this time it's got, what the hell else can they do to this thing other

544
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,880
than make it smaller or give it storage?

545
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,560
Ah, there's a thought.

546
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,520
What about turning the DS a little bit PSP-ish, where, hey, not only is it a DS, but it plays

547
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,200
MP3s and it has scheduling things.

548
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,160
I would refuse to buy one if it does that.

549
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Or here's something...

550
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Wait, wait.

551
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
I gotta know this.

552
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Why is that?

553
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,940
Because it's the same reason why I'm not too fond of the PSP.

554
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,440
It's got way too much shit in it.

555
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,840
If I want to play a game, I want a system that plays a game.

556
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,720
I have an iPhone already, hello?

557
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
I have to be honest.

558
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,320
That's kind of one thing I like about the PSP is that it's a little bit of everything.

559
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
You know what I mean?

560
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
I think it's kind of neat.

561
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,720
If you want your video game system to have everything, then that's fine.

562
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,120
If that's what you want.

563
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,640
But for me personally, because I already have the means to do all this other stuff, I really

564
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,080
just want my system to play my video games.

565
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:55,100
Here's something, a thought, and I could see this happening more than I could see, say,

566
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,680
a new system coming out.

567
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,880
Maybe an expansion that would plug into the bottom of the Game Boy Advance slot or whatever,

568
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,400
and you would plug in your SD memory card because, guess what, you have an SD memory

569
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,760
card slot on your Wii and so maybe this, I don't know, device or whatever that you plug

570
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,800
into the bottom, that is flashable and that you can have firmware upgrades to and whatnot

571
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:22,640
to allow it to play, like say, emulate different games like the Virtual Console or stuff like

572
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,960
that or WiiWare or something like that.

573
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,520
I could see that happening because that would be a little easier.

574
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,880
They can't just get rid of, like if they make it any slimmer, they're going to get rid of

575
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,280
the Game Boy Advance slot, then you're going to have stuff that uses it, like say Guitar

576
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,440
Hero on Tour, I don't know if they're going to screw that over because that would be good

577
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,600
for them, they can't get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot just yet.

578
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,560
It's an interesting thought, but why would they do this when they could release games

579
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,000
on the, I mean they did this for the Game Boy Advance, they released their classic series

580
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
games.

581
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,480
Remember the classic series games that came out on the Game Boy Advance?

582
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,140
Like you could get classic Donkey Kong or classic Metroid even though you could unlock

583
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,220
it in another game, right?

584
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,080
You get these classic games and they were charging like $19.99 for them.

585
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,120
So why would they give you a device where you could get all this shit basically for

586
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,120
free from the Virtual Console when they could recharge for it and people would buy it?

587
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,960
Well, because I don't think people would buy it.

588
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,040
I think people would rather have a service available where they can download all these

589
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:27,100
games, and I think you get a lot more people downloading games, it's a lot easier to download

590
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,480
games on the Virtual Console and pay a lot more money that way.

591
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,320
That also saves them packaging, they don't have to press any of these stupid cartridges.

592
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,560
I think the packaging and stuff, that would save them a lot of money, and it doesn't really

593
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,400
cost them anything to transfer a file.

594
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,880
It's just, you know, basically what they're gonna probably want to do is prevent people

595
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,320
from pirating this stuff, and that's about it.

596
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:57,200
Because, you know, right now with those other SD memory card things, yeah, you can pirate

597
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,200
games like, you know, no end, but they'd have to create something that you wouldn't be able

598
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
to do that.

599
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Well we'll see what happens.

600
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,080
And besides, think of all the other things you could do, I mean, it's essentially just

601
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,560
like that PlayOn thing that they have available now, you could use it as Game Boy, you know,

602
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,700
not necessarily for Virtual Console games and stuff like that, MP3s, you can use it

603
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,160
for like maybe small media files, you know, playing a really, really, really low res movie

604
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,920
or something like that, you know, like think, I don't know, your cartoons.

605
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,840
They had that on the Game Boy Advance, remember those?

606
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,560
They still sell those at like Walmart and stuff, you can get the couple episodes of

607
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,120
Kim Possible or whatever on an Advance cart, and you can watch those movies.

608
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,240
Or, you know, just like an iPod, you know, Nano or something like that with a tiny ass

609
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,840
screen on it, you know, you can do something like that.

610
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,400
As long as it shuts the kids up in the backseat of the car, right?

611
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Exactly.

612
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,280
Well this is something that will shut a lot of people up for a while, it's Final Fantasy

613
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,880
4, and the reason why I say that is because once you start playing this game, you get

614
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,420
sucked into it for a while.

615
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,120
It's a pretty epic RPG, one of my favorites on the Super Nintendo.

616
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,740
I can't wait to play the new version on the DS, and we talked about this a little bit

617
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,020
last week, and this is a bit of a follow-up, is that there was a rumor that Final Fantasy

618
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,240
4 was, yes, it's going to be North American bound because it showed up on the cover, Nintendo

619
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,080
Power and all this stuff, well Squeenix confirmed it this week, Final Fantasy 4 will be coming

620
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,200
out July 22nd in North America, which is a little bit off from the date I seem to recall

621
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Loki mentioning.

622
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,080
Well, they revised it, bumped it up a week.

623
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,520
All because of you, probably, right?

624
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Yeah.

625
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Just kidding.

626
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,580
It is, of course, Final Fantasy 4 with some graphical upgrades, they also have, get this

627
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,640
fully voiced cutscenes and other added content, so that's going to be interesting, this whole

628
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
mini movie thing.

629
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,400
And then my mistake from last week, it wasn't Dragon Quest V, it was Dragon Quest IV.

630
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,320
Oh, okay.

631
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,160
That is also on its way, but that's secret type thing, right?

632
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Shhh.

633
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Secret.

634
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Secret.

635
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Okay.

636
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,200
All right, so we'll see what happens next from Squeenix, I guess that's probably why

637
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,440
this game has taken a long time to come out from Japan to the US is because they're having

638
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,360
to redo the voices now too, which I'm sure can't be an easy thing on the DS because then

639
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,320
they have to go basically remake the whole cartridges and all that, so please voice acting,

640
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,800
don't suck in this, please do not ruin my fond fond memories of Final Fantasy 4 or I'll

641
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
cry.

642
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,440
I don't know why they can't leave it intact.

643
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
But no.

644
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
But no.

645
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,860
Maybe the classic version will be in there somewhere, I don't know.

646
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
One can hope.

647
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:27,280
Well, at any rate, something else that has made a lot of people on the internet go Squee,

648
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,840
is a, but not Squeenix, okay, is a strong bad game coming to WiiWare, and I am very

649
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
happy about this.

650
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
Did you watch the trailer?

651
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,560
I have not seen the trailer yet, remember I was on 56.6K most of the week.

652
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:45,400
The trailer is hilarious, but there is a game coming out called Strong Bad's Cool Game for

653
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,800
Attractive People.

654
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Which is, yeah.

655
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,640
Aw, I'm sorry, Loki, you can't play.

656
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,600
That's alright.

657
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:03,080
Or if you're, you know, super cool, as the trailer says, it's SBCG for AP.

658
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
So yeah.

659
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,160
But anyway, it's gonna be episodic games, gonna be out starting in June.

660
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:15,880
Being put out by Telltale Games, and it's five episode season, and it will be out once

661
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
a month.

662
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,920
And they're the ones that did the Sam and Max games.

663
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,160
Are they?

664
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
Interesting.

665
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,840
Speaking of which, that's Sam and Max for the Wii, that's season one.

666
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Only.

667
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Only season one.

668
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
Oh, thank you for the update.

669
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Appreciate it.

670
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,200
But it should be reasonable.

671
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,920
Well there's gonna be a, the trailer is actually posted in our chat room right now, chat.orangelaunchvideo.com

672
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,840
from Tigerclaw, found it on YouTube and dug that up.

673
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,920
Going back to the last story, because there was a lot of comments from the voice chat

674
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,320
on Final Fantasy IV, going back to some comments from our chat room.

675
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,560
Let's see, Jonathan F. is fantasizing Final Fantasy VI with voices, because you would

676
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,940
have the opera scene with singing.

677
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,640
Celeste would actually sing the opera.

678
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,600
That could be, that could be, go either way.

679
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,640
That could be really good or really bad.

680
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,400
Well like, they could do it like, Dear Friends.

681
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,000
If they get real people to do it, yeah, well remember when we went to, it was More Friends,

682
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,680
not Dear Friends, but More Friends.

683
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
They did the opera live.

684
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
And it, it wasn't bad.

685
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,160
It was actually really good.

686
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,560
FootyMonster is happy about the cutscenes.

687
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,040
He says, voice cutscenes are awesome.

688
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,840
I'm very happy about this.

689
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,280
RawsteelUT, not so happy.

690
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,840
He says, voices on the DS?

691
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,040
That's gonna be massive compression.

692
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,080
But he says, ooh, Dragon Quest IV.

693
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,400
ShadowSlayer thinks it could be good if they get good voice actors.

694
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,480
Odd1 says, it's dependent on how big the card for the game is.

695
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,560
And Zeppelin says, why can't they put one to two gigabyte in a DS card?

696
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,920
I'm pretty sure they can, can't they?

697
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
I think they can.

698
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Yeah, why not?

699
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,960
If your camera can fit like two gigabytes, I'm sure those DS cards can crank in like

700
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,360
four gigabytes on those cards.

701
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,760
You'd probably get some pretty massive games on there.

702
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
So.

703
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Yeah.

704
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
So this is another rumor.

705
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,840
Oh, I'm sorry, was there more on the Strong Bad stuff?

706
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,400
I had more to say.

707
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
Oh, sure, sure.

708
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
But that's okay.

709
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,640
Well, there's nobody in chat commenting on it either.

710
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,240
What do you guys think of the Strong Bad game?

711
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,040
Oh, BlackWolf says the Strong Bad game is also coming to the PC.

712
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,080
So if you don't want to download that on the Wii, you can also get it on the PC.

713
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:14,120
Well, I was going to say the type of game is a 3D point, to actually quote a quote from

714
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,880
Strong Bad, okay, it is a puffy 3D point-and-click-em-up adventure.

715
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,680
You need to do it in the Strong Bad voice.

716
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,680
No.

717
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,560
Dan can do the Strong Bad voice.

718
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,400
I cannot.

719
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,560
You can turn the light switch on or off.

720
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
That's all I remember.

721
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
All right.

722
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,760
I did not install it so you could have a light switch rave.

723
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,000
What do you think?

724
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Winner or sellout?

725
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Winner!

726
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Winner?

727
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I hope so.

728
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It all depends on the game.

729
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,580
But that's hopeful if it's the same folks that did Sam and Max, so we'll see.

730
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:56,280
Another game that hopefully will be coming soon, Elibits 2.

731
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,160
And of course, this is coming from the latest issue of the official Nintendo magazine, reporting

732
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,200
that Elibits 2 will be due out on the Wii later this year, which is odd because I thought

733
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,400
it was supposed to be due out on the DS later this year.

734
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,520
Either way, it'll be coming to a Nintendo system this year probably, and hopefully won't

735
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,800
be just mediocre like the last game.

736
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,000
I kind of like the last game with the level designs and stuff like that.

737
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,040
The last game was kind of neat, but there was something about it that didn't keep me

738
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,480
there long-term, you know what I mean?

739
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,080
I don't know if I just felt like there wasn't a lot to keep me going in that game, you know

740
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
what I mean?

741
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,520
Which is odd to say because there was the level editor and those things like that, but

742
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
I don't know.

743
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,920
It just kind of seemed like the game got kind of old.

744
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,160
The formula to the game got a little bit old to me, so hopefully they'll have some.

745
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,020
I mean, but think about how far the Wii has progressed since Elibits was...

746
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,200
It wasn't in the launch, but it was right after, right?

747
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,720
Didn't Elibits come out right after launch?

748
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,600
It was one of the first major games to come out after launch.

749
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,720
Now they have a lot more they can play with.

750
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm sure technologies have come along and developed in the Wii games as well as online

751
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
possibly, which could be interesting.

752
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,400
I don't know what they could do with a DS version of the game, because a lot of that

753
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,480
game required you to be able to pull on the remote and twist it and stuff like that.

754
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:22,680
It'd be hard not to have that depth sensing that the Wii version had in the DS version.

755
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,960
Some comments from chat on Elibits, Sephiroth1215 not happy from this.

756
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,020
Ah no, I hate Elibits, and RawsteelUT says, it's Elibits, no one cares.

757
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,520
Frisbee wants to mention that it was a launch title in Japan.

758
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,440
Qualtippo says, Elibits seemed good at the time, but no staying power though.

759
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,800
And Gerardimo says, Elibits was good and innovative, just shallow.

760
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,080
That might actually be a good way of phrasing it.

761
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
But I don't know.

762
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,920
I mean, you really want to appreciate Elibits, but I don't know, it just kind of got old

763
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
quick.

764
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,160
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join in the fun here on this Sunday night.

765
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,000
Remember we are on a new network, allgames.com.

766
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,360
At this time we're not, it's just too much to read the All Games chat and the Orange

767
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,760
Lounge chat and we have people chatting on Justin.TV as well who thinks I'm neglecting

768
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,880
them over on Justin.TV.

769
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,080
I'm not, it's just a lot to read and try to do a show at the same time and bring you more

770
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:16,360
gaming news like this one about the white GameCube controller.

771
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,140
That's right, there is a white GameCube controller coming out a little later this year if you

772
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,680
live in Japan.

773
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,680
That's the problem.

774
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,540
It's only going to come out for those of you guys in Japan.

775
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,080
It's a little weird though that this is just now coming out.

776
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,420
It's a white GameCube controller to match the Wii basically.

777
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,600
It is the same color as the Nintendo Wii.

778
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,240
And it's coming out for the games that will support the GameCube controller such as Super

779
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,880
Smash Brothers and now Mario Kart Wii we know is going to support the GameCube controller.

780
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,840
So there's a, this is going to be coming out in Japan.

781
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,820
But the odd thing is, why not a Wavebird controller that would make so much more sense because

782
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
the Wavebird was pretty awesome.

783
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,800
I don't know if it's a cost thing or what.

784
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,100
But who knows if this will be coming out here.

785
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,880
It's actually a lot sooner than later this year.

786
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,800
That is coming out later this month according to Nintendo of Japan's website.

787
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,880
So pretty cool.

788
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,840
I don't know, do you think they ought to bring Wavebirds, white Wavebirds to the Wii?

789
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,760
Or does it matter because if you didn't buy one-

790
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,840
There are Wavebirds?

791
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,680
Because there already are Wavebirds and if you weren't-

792
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,000
But they don't make them anymore.

793
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So?

794
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,680
So you're basically saying screw you to everyone who didn't get one like me.

795
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
I can bring them over.

796
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
You suck.

797
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,660
But honestly, and I'll tell you this, remember when they came out with those different colored

798
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,480
controllers for the GameCube?

799
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:44,200
Well GameStop and a few other retailers were getting shipments of them.

800
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,520
They were even selling the spice color, the orange one basically, that we didn't technically

801
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,200
get a release of over here.

802
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,360
So I actually wouldn't be too surprised to see it at GameStop, GameCrazy, any of your

803
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,160
actual retailers.

804
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,260
And they actually get hori items too, to sell.

805
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,600
You sometimes see these little random import things too at random stores.

806
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Just kind of have to look around.

807
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
You know what I mean?

808
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:20,160
So our oddest find as far as import anything went at actual GameStop was buying Capcom

809
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:27,480
Classic Collection Volume 2, which was the Ghosts and Goblins, the Makaimura, Daimakaimura.

810
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,600
But it never came out here, right?

811
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,520
No, we never got that collection.

812
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:38,320
We got the Japanese one at a GameStop in Hilltop Mall.

813
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,800
Several people in chat, by the way, mentioning that the Wavebirds did not have rumble.

814
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,240
Perhaps that's the reason Nintendo is deciding not to do it.

815
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,780
Because Sony learned the hard way, you gotta have rumble.

816
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,960
Rumble is not so last gen, as they tried to say at E3 a couple years ago.

817
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,960
They learned the hard way.

818
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
So maybe that's why.

819
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,760
But why, I mean, is a Wavebird with rumble that hard to do?

820
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,120
I mean is it?

821
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
I don't know.

822
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Maybe it's just me.

823
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,120
It's impossible.

824
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,480
If the Xbox 360 wireless can do rumble, I would think.

825
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,920
Maybe it's just me.

826
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,200
It's not that hard.

827
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
I didn't think so.

828
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,560
I mean, I'm not even, no, no, no, no, no.

829
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
Alright, moving on.

830
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,520
I can't fathom why they think it'd be difficult, but anyway, for our Squenix fans out there,

831
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,760
and actually for anyone who is a fan of the manga series Soul Eater, there is going to

832
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,200
be a Soul Eater RPG out on the Wii, put out by Squenix.

833
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,080
And if you don't know anything about Soul Eater, there's a Wikipedia article, so enjoy.

834
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:46,800
But it will be coming to the US, and actually, my apologies, it's so far listed as Japan

835
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,960
only and I don't think it's going to be coming out anywhere else.

836
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
So.

837
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,840
I mean, because honestly, it has, I don't even think the Soul Eater manga's come out

838
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,400
over in the US, has it?

839
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,440
You're asking the wrong guy when it comes to manga.

840
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:08,440
The whole point of the, I guess, manga is that these people are going to this technical

841
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,640
school to make weapons and have to make this one weapon out of 99 evil human souls and

842
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,400
one belonging to this witch to make a death scythe.

843
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,760
Which I think death scythe, and I think back to Gundam Wing, so whatever.

844
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,600
Well the way you describe it, it sounds kind of cool.

845
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,200
Yeah, it would be something I would read.

846
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
But I don't know if that's something that would come out here.

847
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
No.

848
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,120
I mean, I don't know if, I'll read the manga I guess.

849
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,300
Well I guess it's nice to see Squeenix doing something that's, you know, outside of their

850
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,640
usual IPs, if nothing else, right?

851
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Yeah.

852
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,040
I mean, how many actual manga adaptations in game have they really done?

853
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I can't think of a lot.

854
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,840
But they've had their stuff done as manga.

855
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:54,400
It's better than continuing to bastardize the Blank of Mana series.

856
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,160
I almost bought that game on DS.

857
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,960
I'll never forgive them for that PlayStation 1.

858
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,960
What was PlayStation 1?

859
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
Was that Legend of Mana?

860
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Legend of Mana.

861
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Oh my god, I hated that game.

862
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
You know what my problem with Legend of Mana was?

863
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
I hated that game.

864
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
What?

865
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,240
Is I imported it like a dumbass.

866
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:16,000
And that was the most text-intensive, kanji-heavy game I have ever freaking played.

867
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,160
And I could read like five words on an entire page.

868
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,400
You know what other Squeenix collection I can't stand, and they've done more than one

869
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
games in the series.

870
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,920
I can't even remember the name of it.

871
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,920
It's the one where there's like eight different people, and they have the eight-

872
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
Saga Frontier.

873
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
The Saga series.

874
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
I freaking hate the Saga series.

875
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,920
Cannot stand it.

876
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,720
Sorry, RPG fans and Saga fans, but if you thought that, you know, because I do give

877
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,560
Final Fantasy a lot of love here on the show, Chrono series, things like that, but if you

878
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,720
thought the Squeenix could do no wrong, just go play the Saga series sometime.

879
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,720
It's pretty bad.

880
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

881
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,840
Why didn't they ever carry on like the Tow Ball series?

882
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
I like that one.

883
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Hmm.

884
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
What about Alundra?

885
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,840
Or Brave Fencer Musache was them, wasn't it?

886
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,840
Yeah, they did a new one.

887
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,840
Those were cute.

888
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Yeah, did they?

889
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
It was a cute one.

890
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,320
I like PlayStation 2.

891
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:12,000
So this is also another article kind of correcting some more wrongs with Mario Kart Wii.

892
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,960
Apparently there was news before that Mario Kart Wii did not work with the freeloader.

893
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
However, that is false.

894
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,000
It actually does work just fine with the freeloader, so if you happen to live in the US and want

895
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,080
to pick up a copy of the European version and get it a few weeks before we get it here,

896
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,720
then go right ahead and pick one up because the freeloader will work just fine.

897
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:44,240
In fact, Import Retailer NCS tested the game on a version 3.1 firmware and it ran just

898
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,160
fine and apparently there was some issues, I guess, with 3.0 firmware.

899
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,600
So if you update your firmware, it should be good to go.

900
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,880
But I don't know.

901
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
Great game.

902
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
Wow.

903
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,880
Didn't take long for that to get opened up there.

904
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,960
But I guess, you know, especially with these staggered international dates, there really

905
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,400
are people who just can't freaking wait.

906
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
Like you.

907
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
Threw away the steering wheel.

908
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Piece of shit.

909
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,600
Would it be cheaper, maybe, to import it so you can get the version without the steering

910
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
wheel?

911
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
I don't know.

912
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,240
I don't think they sell it without the steering wheel.

913
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:29,360
Well, apparently, on Mario Kart Wii, there are already people cheating in there.

914
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,400
And it's in the time trials mode, apparently.

915
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,840
There's all these impossible times that are showing up in the time trials mode.

916
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:40,680
Apparently, somebody on the official Nintendo Magazine forums wrote this on here.

917
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,760
I only saw it on the snowboard track.

918
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,920
There was a guy with a time of 53 point something or other seconds.

919
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,160
There are about three other people with exactly the same time.

920
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,360
Like others have said, on the replay, the guy just does one lap really slow and then

921
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,320
turns the opposite way just after the finish line.

922
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,460
Then the replay doesn't stop.

923
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,840
So he says, personally, I think it's a bug.

924
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,440
I've only seen it on one track.

925
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,280
And there are others with the same time.

926
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,320
What apparently was happening, and I'm not positive this is actually the case, but what

927
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:18,840
I heard was that if you let the time trial sit there for longer than 99 minutes and 99

928
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,560
seconds and 0.99, it'll actually loop back around to zero again.

929
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,440
So people were racing through a couple laps or whatever.

930
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:36,120
And then they would stop, wait for it to just barely flip over from, you know, who has time

931
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,120
to do that?

932
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,880
I mean, really, you're going to sit there and wait for 99 minutes or even, you know,

933
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,400
just leaving it on, doing that.

934
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,160
I don't know what the hell you're doing, you know, going up, going out drinking or something

935
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:54,760
and coming back 90 minutes later, just to have a high score that we all know is a piece

936
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
of crap.

937
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,720
Well, the thing about that, too, though, Nintendo has actually removed those scores off of their

938
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,000
leaderboards now.

939
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So Nintendo is cracking down.

940
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,920
I'm just waiting for it to happen where people find a way to cheat in the multiplayer mode.

941
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
You know what I mean?

942
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
That's going to be a...

943
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,800
Oh my God.

944
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,960
I hope Nintendo knows a way to patch this game on the fly if things like that happen,

945
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,840
but we'll see.

946
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,240
I don't know, I don't think they have it built in yet where they can patch games.

947
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,120
In fact, I know they don't have it built in yet where they can patch games.

948
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,440
Does their firmware updates patch the games?

949
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,240
There's firmware updates, but I don't think they patch games.

950
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,400
But the good thing, though, is they don't have an action replay yet for the Wii.

951
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,680
They only have game saves and power saves and stuff like that.

952
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,680
I don't know.

953
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,800
There shouldn't really be a way to cheat unless you do something with the servers or whatever

954
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,360
where you lag someone out.

955
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,080
Plus it just goes back to if you're cheating online, why?

956
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,080
Why really?

957
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,080
What do you got to prove?

958
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,080
I don't know.

959
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,080
You know what I mean?

960
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:04,520
You beat three other strangers in an online Mario match when Nintendo doesn't even tell

961
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,520
you who you're playing against.

962
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,920
I mean, it's kind of like, big wow.

963
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,920
You know?

964
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,840
It's like, do you really have to feel that special?

965
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,000
I don't know.

966
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,440
Maybe it's just me.

967
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:20,040
Well, speaking of special people, you know that there's always that time top 100 most

968
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,760
influential people that they do.

969
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,920
And guess who's on the list this year?

970
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,920
Miyamoto.

971
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,600
He is on the list this year.

972
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:36,880
He has been voted for 25,000 times as of the source I'm reading.

973
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,440
So he's at number 31 out of 200.

974
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,320
And 56%.

975
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:49,480
And basically he's been put on there basically for making Mario and Zelda.

976
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:55,940
And for the new Wii stuff, you know, the things he's trying to do with the Wii.

977
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:00,400
And that, and he's been quoted saying that he wants to make people more aware of their

978
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,520
bodies and get in better shape and use that as a tool to improve their life and not just

979
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,160
slack around, you know?

980
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,360
So how much influence does the online poll have in the final result?

981
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,920
I mean, I seem to recall in the past, Time kind of did their own list of the 100 most

982
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,020
influential people, but then like the online poll kind of ran separately.

983
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,120
And you know, so you'd see like Howard Stern and Miyamoto and all these, you know, people

984
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,200
that have rabid fan bases, you know, towards the top of the list.

985
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,160
Well, see that I'm really not sure exactly how it works, but I can tell you other people

986
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,160
who are on it.

987
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,800
You've heard of Rain, haven't you?

988
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,800
I think so.

989
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,800
Korean.

990
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Oh yeah.

991
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Yeah.

992
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,800
He's actually right up at the top.

993
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Interesting.

994
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,680
And right behind him is Steven Colbert.

995
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,720
See it's people with rabid fan bases like that.

996
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,600
Nothing against Steven Colbert because I think he's hilarious, but you know what I mean?

997
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,160
Well, he does have Captain America shield.

998
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,200
Hey, some comments from Justin TV, actually, who says, I ignore them all the time, but

999
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,080
a good comment here about the whole patching of Wii games.

1000
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,120
Richie Maniac says they can't patch, otherwise they would have fixed Guitar Hero 3 without

1001
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,880
sending out new discs.

1002
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,880
Very good point.

1003
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,120
So if somebody's cheating in Mario Kart, there's nothing they can do about it.

1004
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,240
Well, I'm putting the unlink to vote for Miyamoto in the chat room.

1005
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,680
But you could cheat however you want, however much you want in the...

1006
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,920
And Black Wolf says, is correcting me and saying it's Colbert.

1007
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,680
I thought that was just something he did on the show.

1008
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,680
Is his last name really Colbert?

1009
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,240
I thought that was just the show joke.

1010
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,240
Colbert.

1011
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,240
Because it's weird.

1012
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,240
I know people with the exact same last name in real life, but they pronounce it with the

1013
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,320
hard T. So my bad.

1014
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,800
That's why it's the Colbert Report because, you know.

1015
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,800
Oh.

1016
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,800
Well, I just thought that was a joke.

1017
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,160
I just got corrected again, so people don't correct me, okay?

1018
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,160
This is pissing me off.

1019
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,660
It's hot in here.

1020
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,660
It is hot in here today.

1021
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,040
What is up with the weather?

1022
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:52,480
There's another game that got announced this week during Nintendo's Media Summit.

1023
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
And this is not really a big surprise at all.

1024
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,800
In fact, I want to say we've already seen this being announced at E3 last year, but

1025
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,800
whatever.

1026
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:08,240
Anyways, it is Super Mario, or I should say Mario Super Sluggers.

1027
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:17,140
And it is, of course, a continuation of Super Mario Stadium Baseball.

1028
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:25,160
Just another sports game from Nintendo that's capitalizing on Mario, just like Mario Strikers

1029
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,160
and stuff.

1030
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,480
You know, it's kind of funny.

1031
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,320
I hope they don't do this, but I could just see them because they're kind of following

1032
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,840
the trends of, or I should say bad trends, that third party companies are creating accessories

1033
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,840
for.

1034
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,000
They're creating attachments for the Wii Sports stuff.

1035
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,800
I could just see them releasing this game with a baseball bat attachment or something

1036
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,800
for the Wii.

1037
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,560
Just like, I don't know, try to sell a few more copies.

1038
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,560
Here's my question.

1039
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,800
What really is the difference between the Super Sluggers thing and the Strikers?

1040
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,040
I mean, aren't they just kind of both baseball games?

1041
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,160
No, Strikers is a soccer game, whereas Sluggers is a baseball game.

1042
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,160
Oh, what the hell am I thinking?

1043
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,160
Why am I...

1044
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,160
But there's another...

1045
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,160
Wasn't there another...

1046
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,160
Yeah, there's Mario Baseball.

1047
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,400
Yeah, I'm like, I know there's another baseball game that already freaking came out on the

1048
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,400
Wii.

1049
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,400
Really?

1050
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,680
I could have sworn there was already a baseball game on the Wii.

1051
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,840
No, just like how there was, was it, oh god, I don't remember what the other...

1052
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,200
There was another soccer game that was on GameCube as well.

1053
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,840
So it's just import whatever, you know, sport with Mario in it.

1054
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,840
Yeah.

1055
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,680
Pretty soon it'll be Mario synchronized swimming.

1056
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,680
Just in time for the Beijing Olympics.

1057
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,840
I don't see how there could be any popular Japanese franchise that won't have a baseball

1058
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
game attached to it.

1059
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,280
I guess that's true.

1060
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,880
Baseball is like the sport.

1061
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,920
I guess that's true.

1062
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,360
And guess what, Rob, you'll be happy to know that Toadette is in this game as well.

1063
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,360
Bitch.

1064
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,500
All right, rostielut in chat, dot orange launcher dot com, says, oh, baseball on the Wii.

1065
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,200
This will appeal to the fanboys, really.

1066
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,840
The casuals still have Wii Sports.

1067
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,560
Well, I would think that baseball fanboys would go for something a little more hardcore.

1068
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
MLB 2K8.

1069
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,560
And I don't know if it would necessarily be on the Wii.

1070
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,160
Or MLB Power Pros, you know, where it was just another baseball game.

1071
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,760
Or they've already got like plenty of baseball games on them.

1072
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,840
I would think these are the people that do like baseball on Wii Sports but want to take

1073
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,840
it like one step further.

1074
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
You know what I mean?

1075
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
I don't know.

1076
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,160
I don't know how appealing that is.

1077
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,720
But Jamie does have a good point, especially over in Japan.

1078
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,720
Baseball is huge.

1079
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,480
And you know, baseball is huge here, too.

1080
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,880
It may not be as big as football in this day and age, but.

1081
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,880
That's fine.

1082
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,960
This game will come out in the E3 or whatever.

1083
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,280
I have a feeling, because I heard some rumors before, that this was going to be coming out

1084
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,280
in June.

1085
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,800
And then in July, there was supposed to be that stupid disaster day of crisis.

1086
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,960
I don't remember what blog I read that in, but.

1087
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,480
If this does come out and stuff, and then E3 rolls around and, oh, guess what?

1088
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,480
Wii Sports 2.

1089
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,680
And it's like, ah, shit.

1090
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,120
I just bought this game and now, you know, Wii Sports 2.

1091
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:53,200
Which is going to be probably the number one selling game all time on Wii.

1092
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,200
Mario Hockey.

1093
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,720
Several people want to see that game in our chat room.

1094
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,960
A Mario Hockey game.

1095
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,440
I don't know, though, because I think Nintendo might have a problem with people punching

1096
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,440
Mario in the face.

1097
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,460
Mario Hockey, all that would be is just like Super Mario Strikers with re-skinned, basically.

1098
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,460
You know what they need?

1099
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,840
They need to bring back old school ice hockey.

1100
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,360
I actually had this game on the NES.

1101
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,680
I'm not talking Blades of Steel, although that game was frickin rad, too, but I'm talking

1102
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,880
old school ice hockey.

1103
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,040
Remember this game?

1104
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:23,120
Where you had your entire team consisted of the fat guys, the skinny guys, and the average

1105
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,120
guys.

1106
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,120
Remember that?

1107
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,120
Yeah.

1108
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,120
Mario Hockey 2008.

1109
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
Or Ice Hockey Wii.

1110
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,520
That'd be rad.

1111
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,520
You know you want it.

1112
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,160
All right, let's travel the world and explore upcoming release dates.

1113
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,640
We're going to check out some games that are coming out a little bit sooner than some of

1114
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,340
these other games we've been talking about.

1115
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,140
We will start off in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.

1116
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,200
Really not a lot.

1117
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,800
You really have to wait for the 24th for any big games to start coming out.

1118
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,380
Same thing with the PlayStation 3.

1119
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,480
It's kind of a slow period right now.

1120
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,320
On the Nintendo Wii, nothing either.

1121
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,280
This is a dry week in Japan for these next batch of systems.

1122
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:05,240
But if you want to go back to the PlayStation 2, Ape Escape 3 is coming out now in a Chinese

1123
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,240
language.

1124
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,240
So for the other Asian regions abroad, Ape Escape 3 comes out in Chinese this week.

1125
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:16,080
Also a game called Hoshigari Empusa comes out in Japan on April the 17th.

1126
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:23,760
And going over to the Nintendo DS, Gear Spirit from TV Animation One Piece, Gear Spirit.

1127
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,960
Also from Nintendo, Pack and Ball comes out on the Nintendo DS.

1128
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,480
And a new Phoenix Wright game, Gaikukten Saiban Mask Vision Murder Case.

1129
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,240
Actually, I'm sorry, that's just a price reduction on Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney.

1130
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,340
I was going to say, isn't that already out?

1131
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,340
Just a price reduction.

1132
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,340
Now it's out for much cheaper.

1133
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:46,920
You can import that for about 20 bucks now, plus shipping.

1134
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,240
So that's not bad.

1135
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:59,720
Also on the Nintendo DS, Kansu Hajime Yo Shisan Unyo DS comes out.

1136
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:04,280
And this is just, I don't know, the cover has a bunch of people like planting trees

1137
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,320
on it.

1138
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,160
And I don't know if that's supposed to symbolize like a tree of knowledge or what that is.

1139
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:14,840
Because the category for the game is miscellaneous, which usually means some type of boring training

1140
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,840
type thing.

1141
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,840
I don't think it's a dating sim.

1142
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,840
Joking.

1143
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,000
Because you actually use the touch screen and stuff.

1144
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,720
It's a perverted dating sim, though.

1145
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,880
No, not that kind of dating.

1146
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,760
It's not like, you know, I don't know.

1147
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,760
I'm joking, Rob.

1148
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,360
Let's see if there's anything coming out on the PSP.

1149
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,280
Although I somehow doubt it, but we'll take a look real quick for the PSP in Japan.

1150
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,280
No.

1151
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,560
But the 24th will be a big week.

1152
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,320
There's lots more stuff coming out for you folks in Japan on the 24th.

1153
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:46,840
But this week, you're gonna have to just play the games you already have, I guess.

1154
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,840
That's it.

1155
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:55,320
For the games that are coming out for our friends over in the UK, we have, on the 16th,

1156
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,560
Trackmania Nations Forever on PC.

1157
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,560
Trackmania.

1158
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,960
Those look pretty awesome.

1159
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,960
Is it?

1160
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,960
Yeah.

1161
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,960
Okay.

1162
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,840
I want that Konami track game where you can play as Pyramid Head.

1163
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,840
That's the one I'm waiting for.

1164
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,840
I know, right?

1165
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,840
The new track and field?

1166
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,840
Yeah.

1167
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,840
Do want.

1168
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,840
July.

1169
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,840
The hell with all the other track games.

1170
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,840
July or August.

1171
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,840
Alright, thank you.

1172
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,960
Anyway, also coming out, now this is on the 18th of this next series of games, which is

1173
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,960
the day before my birthday, Emergency Mayhem on Wii.

1174
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,960
Hard to be a god on PC.

1175
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,240
I think I'm gonna need to get that game, okay?

1176
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,480
Story of my life.

1177
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,040
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC.

1178
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:47,360
UEFA Euro 2008 on PC, Xbox 360, and Playstation 3, and PS2, and PSP, and Wonderswan Color,

1179
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:51,240
and Neo Geo Pocket Color, and the Neo Geo CD.

1180
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,480
Those last four are probably not true.

1181
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,680
8 Ball All Stars on DS.

1182
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,640
We have Namco Museum Remix on Wii.

1183
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,320
I need to get that.

1184
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,280
The World Ends With You on DS.

1185
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,000
That's a lot of pressure, isn't it?

1186
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,120
That sounds like something you'd say before you kill someone.

1187
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,120
The World Ends With You.

1188
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,080
No, that sounds like a Bond movie.

1189
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,080
Ooh, it does.

1190
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,520
It does sound like a Bond movie.

1191
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,560
And the very last is Time Crisis 4 on Playstation 3.

1192
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,560
Awesome.

1193
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,720
Yeah, Time Crisis.

1194
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:28,760
In the US, it's an okay release week, I should say.

1195
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:37,480
Starting off, we've got Major League Baseball 2K8 Fantasy All Stars for the DS.

1196
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,400
It's kind of an arcade-style version of that game.

1197
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,880
Sherlock Holmes Nemesis on the PC.

1198
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,280
AMF Bullying Pin Busters on the DS.

1199
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,760
Rondo of Swords on the DS.

1200
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,880
Good Atlus RPG.

1201
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,560
Okami on the Wii.

1202
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,640
Jack Keane on the PC.

1203
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,760
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue on the PS3.

1204
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,560
That's just a small little game there.

1205
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,960
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC.

1206
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:15,600
Also on PC this week, Turok and Europa Universal...

1207
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,880
Was it Universalist Rome?

1208
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,400
That's kind of a weird name.

1209
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,480
High School Musical 2 worked this out on the DS.

1210
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,120
Also another Disney DS game.

1211
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,360
What if I don't want to work it out?

1212
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,360
Then you don't buy the game.

1213
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,680
Alright, I won't.

1214
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,040
Another Disney DS game, Cory in the House.

1215
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,640
The Sims 2 Kitchen and Bath Interior Design Stuff expansion for the PC.

1216
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,680
Oh, yay!

1217
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:49,240
Summer Sports Paradise Island for the Wii, also being brought out by Destineer, which

1218
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,520
has crappy games.

1219
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,600
Teenage Zombies Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies for the DS.

1220
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,520
Emergency Mayhem for the Wii, which is supposed to be just like Crazy Taxi.

1221
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:09,560
And as Rob mentioned earlier, the Final Fantasy XI Vanity of Collection 2008 for the PC.

1222
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,920
We have other releases.

1223
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,040
Do you want to get into that kind of crack?

1224
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,040
Alright, yeah.

1225
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,880
What about the Virtual Console?

1226
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,240
Well these of course have already come out now.

1227
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,800
These are for our UK releases for Virtual Console.

1228
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:28,920
It's Yoshi's Cookie, which is 500 Wii points, the equivalent of 5 euro or 3 pounds 50.

1229
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,120
And it's Yoshi's Cookie.

1230
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,920
What more do I need to say about freaking Yoshi's Cookie?

1231
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,960
That it was far superior on the Super Nintendo, so why they released the Nintendo version

1232
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,960
I have no idea.

1233
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,040
Now the next one.

1234
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,080
We need triumphant music for this, for these next two.

1235
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,080
Hold on, hold on.

1236
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,640
I do have fanfare music somewhere.

1237
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,640
It'll just take me a minute.

1238
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,440
Can you read a different one before you get to those two?

1239
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,320
Well the next two are, these are the only two left.

1240
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,880
Actually, are they?

1241
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,080
No, there's more.

1242
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,160
I will skip ahead and then I will go back to the awesome ones.

1243
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,000
Alright good, because I'm getting the fanfare right now.

1244
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,160
California Games, which is Commodore 64.

1245
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,640
Ooh, Commodore 64 games are hitting the Wii finally.

1246
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,640
And Impossible Mission.

1247
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,480
Both of them.

1248
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,280
That's the one I should have played the fanfare for.

1249
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:19,320
Both of them are 500 Wii points, 3 pounds 50 pence or 5 euro.

1250
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,720
And um, but those aren't the two that- Stay awhile.

1251
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,720
The realm of awesome for me.

1252
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,720
Stay forever.

1253
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,800
Did you ever play Impossible Mission?

1254
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,720
I didn't have a Commodore 64, Rob.

1255
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,720
Really?

1256
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,720
I told you I didn't.

1257
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,720
That's right.

1258
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,080
You know what I had is I had the Texas Instruments stupid retardo computer.

1259
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,920
And I had a Coleco Adam.

1260
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,920
I'm still trying to find the sounds.

1261
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,920
Darn it.

1262
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,360
Well then I will go ahead, because I will go ahead and announce the one that somebody

1263
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,360
gets fanfare.

1264
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,360
Oh you know why?

1265
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:52,560
Because here's the thing, I had to upgrade Winamp to get Shoutcast now.

1266
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,760
And for whatever reason my Winamp is not playing WAV files.

1267
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,080
Although you think it would.

1268
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,320
The old one did.

1269
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,280
I just haven't configured it right, so we have no sounds tonight.

1270
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,600
We'll have Loki sing a fanfare.

1271
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,680
Wait hold on, Loki sing the fanfare.

1272
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,560
I'm not singing the fanfare.

1273
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,560
No fanfare.

1274
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,560
Please.

1275
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,560
Use the NBC music.

1276
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,560
No.

1277
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,560
You can't use it can you?

1278
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,560
Just read it.

1279
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,120
We're wasting so much time.

1280
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,120
Precious time.

1281
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,560
Alright, Wonder Boy from the Sega Master System, 500 Wii points.

1282
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:25,520
And that game is really sweet, but this is the one that makes me super uber happy.

1283
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,520
Fantasy Zone!

1284
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,680
Didn't we announce this last week?

1285
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,680
Yay.

1286
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,680
No.

1287
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,120
I think we announced it was coming, but it wasn't really known when it was coming.

1288
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,120
It's out now.

1289
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,860
You're the Oppa Oppa and you get to shoot stuff and it sort of plays like Defender,

1290
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,640
but it's awesome.

1291
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:46,480
Fantasy Zone is my second favorite game ever.

1292
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,480
And was one of the classic games of the week as well.

1293
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,680
It was the first classic game of the week.

1294
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,680
Alright.

1295
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,680
Nice.

1296
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,160
By the way, in the US on the Virtual Console, you also get Yoshi's Cookie and Bases Loaded

1297
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,240
came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1298
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,080
Speaking of baseball games, if you want to play one of the classics, Bases Loaded sets

1299
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:05,160
you back 500 Wii points.

1300
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,640
Now we'll go back to some gaming news.

1301
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,160
And I don't know, this isn't exactly like totally gaming news, this is basically what

1302
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,160
idiots think.

1303
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,060
I don't know, maybe this should be a new segment on our show.

1304
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:19,060
What idiots think.

1305
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,060
I don't know.

1306
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,700
Here's the deal.

1307
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:25,460
There's this website and it's called WhatTheyPlay.com.

1308
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:32,080
And it's a parental oriented website and they did a poll a little earlier this week.

1309
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:37,860
And what they did in this poll is that they surveyed what would you find most offensive

1310
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,880
in a video game.

1311
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,560
And here's the results.

1312
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:47,900
The choices were a graphically severed human head, a man and a woman having sex, multiple

1313
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:52,200
use of the F word, and two men kissing.

1314
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,200
Here's the thing.

1315
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:59,280
The least offensive according to the poll is multiple usages of the F word, 10%.

1316
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:09,520
The second least offensive, a graphically severed human head with 28%, no 26%.

1317
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:15,300
And then two men kissing, 27%.

1318
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:21,320
So two men kissing is right in the same ballpark as a graphically severed human head in how

1319
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,040
offensive they are in a video game.

1320
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,520
I mean like words escape me.

1321
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,160
I think most people in this generation that probably listen to this program are probably

1322
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,240
rolling their eyes and going, what the fuck at this as well?

1323
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,920
This is just a couple of like old farts that need to like get out of the barn and go outdoors

1324
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,920
once in a while.

1325
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,920
They're answering this poll.

1326
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,000
And then they have a, was it the man and woman having sex?

1327
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,120
Yeah, man and a woman having sex is at 37%, but honestly has no surprise to me.

1328
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,440
I mean, hello, look at American society.

1329
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,960
People are way more pent up over sexual things than they are violence.

1330
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,280
It's been that way forever.

1331
01:03:53,280 --> 01:04:01,480
I have to say that we are probably one of the most, I'd have to say conflicting societies

1332
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:07,600
as far as, because you know, sex sells everything and everything, you know, they're, you know,

1333
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,960
the porn industry is thriving.

1334
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,560
There's all this yet we have this other extreme like, Oh, but we don't talk about that.

1335
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,720
Oh, we don't do this.

1336
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,960
Oh, we don't have this in our game.

1337
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,120
Oh, this is offensive.

1338
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,080
People just need to get over it.

1339
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,760
Sairan says in our chat room, well, what, so Sharon, I keep mispronouncing it says,

1340
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,040
what did the two men look like?

1341
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,560
I guess that is important because if they're like two guys who haven't bathed in a week,

1342
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,600
that would be kind of offensive.

1343
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,600
I think.

1344
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,960
I don't think the kissing would be offensive.

1345
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,840
I would just think that the lack of personal hygiene would be offensive.

1346
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,840
That's the point.

1347
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:42,480
So, so where does like, say, I don't know, a two men kissing graphically severed human

1348
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:47,760
head, uh, on top of a man and woman having sex while they shout, you know, obscenities.

1349
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,120
Where's that fall on the list?

1350
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,520
Is this your next dream game?

1351
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,360
Is there, is there like, I think there, I think there is an OLR dream game to be had

1352
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,360
here.

1353
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:00,520
Is there a write in, uh, uh, write in a vote?

1354
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,520
There should be write in vote.

1355
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,520
All right.

1356
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,520
Yeah.

1357
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,680
My write in vote would be this poll.

1358
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,680
Here it is.

1359
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,680
Okay.

1360
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,840
We're going to call it a what they play.com the game.

1361
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,840
Okay.

1362
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,560
It's what they play.com the game.

1363
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:18,280
And what it is is it, uh, it stars, uh, it stars three people, two guys and a girl.

1364
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,600
And uh, all they do is they know how to say the F word.

1365
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,400
So we get the 10% there.

1366
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,460
And uh, meanwhile the two guys will kiss and then the man and the woman will have sex while

1367
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,160
they sever the other guy's head.

1368
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,160
I'm not sure.

1369
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:39,000
I'm not sure where the game is in this, but we'll find it somewhere to take pictures.

1370
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Yeah.

1371
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Yeah.

1372
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Like Pokemon.

1373
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Okay.

1374
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,200
There it is.

1375
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:54,160
So what the more offensive the photo is, the more D the photo is then that's beautiful.

1376
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,160
I love this idea.

1377
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,160
Sick imagination.

1378
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,160
It's what they play.

1379
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,160
Snap.

1380
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,160
Okay.

1381
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,160
I want to change the name.

1382
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,160
The game.

1383
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,160
Okay.

1384
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,160
So an OLR dream game.

1385
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,160
Here it is.

1386
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,160
What they play.

1387
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,160
Snap.

1388
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,160
So it is to our Wiki.

1389
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,160
Yes.

1390
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,160
We need a dream games Wiki.

1391
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,160
There is the dream games.

1392
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,160
Yes.

1393
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,160
There's already a Wiki page on there, so we'll need to get this added.

1394
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:20,040
Uh, what they play snap and in what they play snap is three people that use the F word,

1395
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:24,640
then half kiss each other, then have sex with each other, then kill each other while you

1396
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:29,640
take pictures on a track.

1397
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:39,000
And then in later stages, in later stages, you get the pester ball because no one likes

1398
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,480
the pester ball.

1399
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,040
We seriously have problems.

1400
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,040
Rob is red in the face.

1401
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,440
I don't think it's from the heat.

1402
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,400
I think it's just so excited about the idea because I find this immature shit funny.

1403
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,400
Okay.

1404
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,600
Let's go back.

1405
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,400
Let's go back to the root problem though.

1406
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,400
Here is this survey.

1407
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,960
Obviously we're being a little bit facetious with this whole stuff here.

1408
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,720
The problem is I want the game.

1409
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,480
I think quick poll.

1410
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,080
We need to do an insta poll right now in a orange lounge.

1411
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,080
Okay.

1412
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,080
Chat that orange laundry.com.

1413
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,060
I want to see some wiser ends.

1414
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:16,200
Would you buy what they play snap wire and would you play it?

1415
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,520
Let's say the game costs $29.99.

1416
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,040
Would you put, would you buy it?

1417
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,680
And it's on Nintendo Wii.

1418
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,680
Would you buy it?

1419
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,680
Wire end.

1420
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,560
I think that that's what makes that the most, just completely farcical.

1421
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,560
Act now.

1422
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:38,840
We'll throw in a, um, a severed head controller, like cover attachment, severed head attachment.

1423
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:42,280
It'd be a camera, severed head camera.

1424
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,360
Somebody in chat said something about this and I thought it was really good.

1425
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:49,280
Um, I think it was Ross Steele, UT had said something and I lost it here.

1426
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,280
Oh, here it is.

1427
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,200
Uh, seriously, this isn't exactly a scientific poll.

1428
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,680
You'd get different results on game facts and it does have to do with the audience that

1429
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,980
was, uh, sampled is cause it was, you know, more of a conservative audience.

1430
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:06,000
But still, I mean, doesn't that kind of say something about just society in general?

1431
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,280
I mean, maybe this goes beyond gaming a little bit.

1432
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:13,160
Pardon us for getting so deep, but seriously guys, seriously, two guys kissing is more

1433
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,680
offensive than a severed head.

1434
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,560
Like, I hate to break it to you, but like, you know, I don't think it's, I'm biased just

1435
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:24,400
because I happen to be gay and you know, well, hell, the guy I'm seeing and have been seeing

1436
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,680
for over a year now is a conservative.

1437
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,760
He's very active in Republican, he's a log cabin guy.

1438
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,080
He's very active in Republican politics.

1439
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,400
You know, whether you are conservative or liberal, doesn't really have anything to do

1440
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,400
it.

1441
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:40,480
I don't know whether you're an idiot or not in terms of this poll, but I don't know.

1442
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:44,920
Like I, me personally, I cannot watch the Saw movies like that level of violence.

1443
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,840
Like I watched the first one and I was like, that's enough.

1444
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,240
I've heard about what's in the other ones.

1445
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,720
I don't need to see it.

1446
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,760
If you want to watch it, have fun.

1447
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,040
You want to see that sick shit, go for it.

1448
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,320
But for me, like I don't want to watch that.

1449
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,120
There's other things I could watch with my time.

1450
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,120
Like showgirls.

1451
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:04,520
Showgirls is great and for the record, I've never seen a Saw movie and never will.

1452
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,040
Cause it's just, you know, I don't know.

1453
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,240
I think that is a generational thing.

1454
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,480
Am I going to change my opinion as I get older or what is it?

1455
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,480
No, no.

1456
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:22,320
I think that the violent graphic violence for the sake of graphic violence is unnecessary.

1457
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,320
You know, I believe in all things in moderation.

1458
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:28,240
Like if I have a movie that's just a good movie that happens to have some graphic violence

1459
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,960
in it, then that's okay.

1460
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:35,240
I don't care if there's a little blood and gore thrown out if it's part, you know, if

1461
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:39,400
it moves the story along, but when the whole movie is nothing but that, then I think that

1462
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,960
it's just crap.

1463
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,880
Here are the results of our quick poll.

1464
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,400
Would you buy our game on the Nintendo Wii?

1465
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,400
Why?

1466
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,400
Why?

1467
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,400
Why?

1468
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,400
N. Throw the pester ball at the people having sex and they look up at you and say, fuck.

1469
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,400
Why?

1470
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,400
Why?

1471
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,400
Why?

1472
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,400
Why?

1473
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,400
Why?

1474
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,400
Why?

1475
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,400
Why?

1476
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,400
Why?

1477
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,400
Why?

1478
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,400
Why?

1479
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,400
Why?

1480
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,400
Why?

1481
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,740
Why?

1482
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:05,940
Why?

1483
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,640
Why?

1484
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,080
Why in a fucking instant?

1485
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,080
And why?

1486
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,040
There you have it.

1487
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,720
The results of the OLR quick poll.

1488
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,320
Interesting comment as well from odd1.

1489
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,140
Torture porn is just what the name says.

1490
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,720
I'll leave it but nothing against those who watch it.

1491
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,720
Why?

1492
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,400
Because I don't bloody think that one piece of media is going to completely change a person

1493
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,920
and destroy it whatever moral fiber they might have.

1494
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,160
And Jirnami says, case in point-

1495
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,380
Each of the killer, you know, there's a lot of sick shit out there in movies

1496
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:39,440
If you want to watch it go for it, but you know on the other hand if people want to watch

1497
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:43,940
If people want to play a game that might involve a sexual component

1498
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,920
Whatever right? That's what warnings are for. Hi exactly. It's what reviews are for. Hi read them, you know

1499
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:56,620
Be educated be a little educated when it comes to purchasing your games be you know

1500
01:10:56,620 --> 01:11:00,940
What there's people should just be educated in general and not so freakin head up their ass

1501
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,840
That's what I think all right your head out of your ass I

1502
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,180
Don't really know what else to say in response to this story

1503
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:14,760
I mean, you know, you think I'd have a big rant or something to say with this, but sadly the results

1504
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,620
Don't kind of surprise me. It's just the way our society is I think

1505
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:23,820
Think some of the people need to need to re-examine their priorities. I think this poll shows

1506
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:28,060
I think that's the best way I can some of it this poll shows that there are people out there

1507
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:35,720
With their certain agendas that really really need to re-examine their priorities. That's it back to games

1508
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,400
Okay Legos

1509
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,600
Okay, Legos aren't really games, but they do make Lego games

1510
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,840
And you know that I think that the Lego Star Wars games are tons of fun

1511
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:53,760
so now there is going to be by Activision a Lego, Indiana Jones game that's going to be out on the 6th of June and

1512
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,040
you have

1513
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,600
you can actually play as over 60 characters and

1514
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:05,200
Some of his friends and some of the enemies and you can actually

1515
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,800
Customize your characters by mixing out their parts

1516
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,520
you know like when you play with Legos and

1517
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:18,240
And you have your whip and it's from what I'm seeing that that the whole using the whip is sort of like

1518
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,120
Pitfall

1519
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,680
because you're saying that you use it to get over gaps and hit switches and

1520
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:32,040
You can use you can use it to pick up items in the game to throw at people

1521
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:39,480
And then you can interact you know with your environment, and you swim and climb and you know

1522
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:46,000
Jumping climbing trees that type of stuff. Well, Indiana Jones is kind of fun anyway. Yeah, I think it'd be pretty fun

1523
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,360
And I go series is cute. Go games are so fun

1524
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,120
I mean that's they may not be the most stellar looking games

1525
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,680
They may be kind of dumb, but the Lego games are just fun

1526
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,760
You know just like a movie full of sex and violence dumb fun

1527
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,260
No, that's showgirls. Oh, sorry, which is both a movie full anyway

1528
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:12,860
It's also coming out in the US and released North America in June as well, so around the same time as the movie

1529
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,420
awesome

1530
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:20,900
There's gonna be an update coming. Well. We've been talking about for a while now codename Bogart. Which is coming to

1531
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:28,020
Burnout paradise it's going to be basically the next update that they have hopefully adding this

1532
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:35,460
Brand new island to race in and going to be part of you know many different updates that they're going to have for the game

1533
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:41,060
Some of the things that are going to be coming with it including some bug fixes

1534
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:44,680
That they're going to be identifying the top 10

1535
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,180
problems that users have been facing

1536
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,620
online functionality

1537
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:52,100
balancing tweaks

1538
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:58,020
They're gonna be fixing like the head-on takedowns which seemed unfair. I guess an unrealistic

1539
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:02,180
unfair low-speed takedowns have been removed and

1540
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,100
Then they're gonna also be of course adding you know

1541
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,460
the brand new tracks and or

1542
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:15,340
Portions of the game and hopefully some new cars to download all this is supposed to happen April

1543
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:20,300
24th so I guess a lot to happen in a day. Yeah, and so I guess we'll have to

1544
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:23,060
Stay tuned to see what that is. I'm interested in it

1545
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:27,860
I'm actually gonna start playing the game again once it comes out, but only briefly because you know

1546
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,420
Paradise kind of wore out quick. I don't think I like the open-world thing

1547
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,180
I think I'd like my burnout the way it was I don't like what they did to it. I like the open-world

1548
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,460
It's just I don't know yeah, I know I'm being so hypocritical because I loved it in test drive

1549
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,020
Maybe that's why I'm kind of like it's just when I played burnout

1550
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,160
I played this before a lot of grinding is what it is because a lot of like okay

1551
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:52,840
You finish this many races now you have to do it all over again to get this next license

1552
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,040
And I got to do it all over again

1553
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:58,220
Where it's like the crash modes and stuff like that of the you know older games

1554
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:05,880
They you know provided different scenarios and stuff to play through whereas this game. You can kind of crash anywhere, but there's only really

1555
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:11,920
Specific spots that you're going to kind of want to go to where you can get enough points to you know get to the next

1556
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,760
License well burnout paradise is not the only game that's getting a patch this week

1557
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:22,840
Layer is also going to be getting a patch very soon. It's coming out in Japan on April 17th

1558
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,620
That's probably the same day. You're likely to see it everywhere else the biggest thing that you're getting in this patch

1559
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:35,600
Not just rumble support for the new rumble controllers coming out the dual shock threes, but now you're going to get analog controls

1560
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:40,520
Finally you don't have to just control with the six axis controller

1561
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:47,660
You can also there will be a new targeting icon that shows up and now you can download wind dragon and poison dragon

1562
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,320
The different types dragons that you can use in any old stage

1563
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,160
I wonder if this will change people's opinions on the game because some of the people you know biggest bitch

1564
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:59,500
They had was the controls yeah, if they fix the controls. I'd be really interested to see how the game plays out

1565
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:05,320
I want to see some people just some not everybody but some people that reviewed this game before like re-review it if that makes sense

1566
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:12,320
They may actually I'd be curious to see that which is very interesting if a patch has that big of an impact on a game

1567
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,720
You know what? I mean? Well, I'll teach them to stick with the stupid motion controls

1568
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:21,660
Hmm only you know they should have it as an option. Hmm. Just like rumble

1569
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,760
true

1570
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:29,880
Well some good news for our friends over in the UK is that

1571
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:36,400
one of the retailers shop to is confirmed that they are going to be selling a Grand Theft Auto for

1572
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,080
hardware bundle that will have

1573
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:48,080
The 40 gig ps3 6-axis and a copy of GTA 4 and it will be out on the 29th of April for 299 pounds

1574
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,800
Which is for the equivalent of a 590 bucks for us?

1575
01:16:51,800 --> 01:17:00,960
Nice any word on something like that coming over here. Not that I've seen hmm

1576
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,640
Are you surprised Loki at the lack?

1577
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,960
I mean, I know you're big on Grand Theft Auto 4 and this is supposed to be like a system selling type game

1578
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,960
I have actually heard people thinking of investing in a PlayStation 3 because they want to get Grand Theft Auto and

1579
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,440
For whatever reason there's more games on the ps3 than interest them as opposed to Xbox 360

1580
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:25,160
Why isn't Sony jumping on the opportunity over here? I don't know probably because they have a new bundle coming out with

1581
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,520
Metal Gear Solid 4 I mean if they were going to do a bundle they would have already announced it by now I

1582
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,920
Don't know. Maybe they're just not selling as well over

1583
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:41,400
Say you know in Europe and stuff. Maybe they're really needing to push them. That's why they have all those extra bundles over there

1584
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:48,920
Really though and they've been having trouble keeping the bundles or actually these systems in I think

1585
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,200
Although we haven't been selling them too fast

1586
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:58,280
I know so and I mean I went to Fry's the other day, and they had pallets of just ps3s just sitting there, so

1587
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,060
It's not like there was a shortage of them. It's just people

1588
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,760
need games to play on it and

1589
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:11,960
I guess Grand Theft Auto will be one of those games. It'll be one they'll sell systems, but at the same time. I think you know

1590
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,040
Just if people actually realize hey

1591
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,180
there's a lot of games on 360 as well, and it's coming out on there, but

1592
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,680
To each his own I guess whatever their preference is

1593
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:31,540
So one thing though that's kind of disappointing is the PlayStation Network will be going down tomorrow for about 15 hours

1594
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,580
But not a big deal like because it will be coming back

1595
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:42,420
Shortly after that with the brand new PlayStation store. It's going to be completely redesigned

1596
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:45,400
I'm going to have a bunch of new features in there as well

1597
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:51,860
supposed to be a little bit easier to browse kind of like the I don't know sink star store a little bit and

1598
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:56,100
Some of the cool things that they're going to have on there as well

1599
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,780
hopefully

1600
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,460
the home

1601
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,820
beta will be coming out pretty soon, but

1602
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,940
You know lots of stuff to look forward to and it's nice to see that

1603
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:13,060
They're actually updating their store because it was pretty hard the browse through and this looks a little bit better

1604
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:20,340
Yeah, it's a I think the PlayStation store kind of needed some look and feel changes to it

1605
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,660
So I hope this goes well for them

1606
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:29,280
You know what other store needs to look and changes that fucking virtual console store needs some serious updates

1607
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,280
well

1608
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:37,080
Going from hardcore updates and news to big old rumors. This is take this with a big grain of salt

1609
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,920
Apparently this is coming over from game reactor

1610
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:48,280
Some blogger on there has said that apparently John Woo is going to announce the Metroid film at

1611
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,080
Next week's comic-con in New York City

1612
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,280
Here's the deal with it. It's going to star

1613
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,840
Christiana Loken and she was the main actress in blood rain

1614
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,360
apparently

1615
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,840
But thank God is not being directed by a bowl like blood rain was and God

1616
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:07,680
And apparently there's a little picture that made its way through it that says

1617
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,760
5209 like a release date May 2nd of 2009

1618
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:17,200
So now here's the thing is that you might go bullshit, but there are some pieces of it that add up

1619
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:21,320
John Woo purchase the rights to Metroid although that was a couple years ago

1620
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:27,540
But he did and he's gotten involved with video games before because there was stranglehold right was a John Woo game as well

1621
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,160
so

1622
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:34,260
Kind of interesting I think the release date makes this fault because I think if this were true

1623
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:41,680
The movie would already be filming and I don't know that seems like a pretty aggressive release date to just like unless they're gonna like start

1624
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:45,200
Filming it this summer. I guess they could really see it can change. I mean, it's just

1625
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:51,840
Good. Well, I think also keep in mind that a lot of times especially for seek for projects that they're gonna

1626
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:57,680
Hype quite a bit and when I actually push out there that they'll start filming them under a false name, but

1627
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:05,600
Still I just with the amount of buzz that a game like this would get I would think that something would leak

1628
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,320
You know what? I mean, I

1629
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,920
Don't know. I

1630
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:11,240
Don't know if they're doing it all on a soundstage

1631
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:17,180
You know also all the work that they could be doing right now could be up now maybe going in reverse a little bit doing

1632
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:23,200
A lot of the CG work now and then going back and then filming this stuff and then adding the CG stuff in there

1633
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,200
I don't know

1634
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,480
There's modeling

1635
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:31,840
Yeah, I would just think the special effects that a Metroid movie would take are gonna take too long unless they've already been doing them

1636
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,640
But again if they've already been doing them some dude on a blog somewhere would not have been the first one to notice this

1637
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,240
It's gonna really suck

1638
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,760
That would be sad. That would be very sad

1639
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:47,620
Because after all the we both films, you know, they don't take that long to put together. So

1640
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,600
bite your tongue

1641
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:56,560
Metroid set in like a Western or something like that. All right. Well, we're about to the end of the first half of our program

1642
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,580
That's right. You guys listening at all games calm for the first time possibly to our show. We're a long show

1643
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:01,640
We're about a three hour show

1644
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,900
We're about to the end of the first half of our program

1645
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:09,060
But we don't end part a until we have a chance to go back and look at the classics

1646
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,680
And I guess I already did that a little bit during my gaming week

1647
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:16,400
I talked about one classic game that wasn't the official game of the week dark Sakura likes to you know

1648
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,760
She's got the massive collection. She was talking about earlier

1649
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:24,640
She likes to dig through her collection every week and find one game to spotlight for those you guys

1650
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:28,860
Pay a little respect to the classic video game of the week

1651
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:35,080
So dark Sakura what classic video game have you selected for the crowd this week?

1652
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,840
This is another one that makes my heart hurt that it's considered a classic now

1653
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:45,360
Um, but it came out on PlayStation and it's bus to move. I'm not talking about puzzle bobble

1654
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:49,720
it came out over here as this is bust a groove because

1655
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:54,560
Puzzle puzzle bobble came out as best to move already and therefore had the license in the u.s.

1656
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:13,560
Um, but in Japan, it was best to move. Let's take a listen

1657
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:19,360
Whoever's playing this kitty and is actually doing pretty good and the video file that we are playing this from is actually the person playing

1658
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:23,760
On the mode with no commands. I don't know if you noticed that Rob. Yeah, I know that

1659
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,600
I was like something's wrong with this when I was looking at it. There's no arrows that you hit in

1660
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,760
Yeah, that's actually when I was at my height of playing this game. I used to play it without hands

1661
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,880
Everyone has the same damn moves. You're probably gonna have to explain for our listeners how this is different from DDR

1662
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,460
okay, and basically what bus to move is it's sort of a

1663
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:45,140
versus dance game where you

1664
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,880
put in the commands that it brings up on the screen and you do them you hit your

1665
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:56,840
Trigger, but I guess I usually call it the trigger. Whatever your last command button is to activate those moves

1666
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:03,360
Right on the beat. So you have to have good rhythm to make sure that you're you're hitting this, right? And

1667
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:10,560
Some of the songs go from super easy to super hard to just being easy and then having tricky parts

1668
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:17,040
Like this one in fact at the very end of this part is where the trickiest part of the song for me is

1669
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,640
But and as you might have just heard where it says high scoring moves

1670
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:23,920
You actually have secret moves that when it comes up to the character's

1671
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:30,440
Solo part if you know what that command is then you can put in those moves and it boosts your score even more

1672
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:36,160
It has a bunch of different characters had different songs each you had

1673
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:41,720
Different styles they actually changed quite a bit though when the US version came out you had Frida

1674
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:47,440
Gaso ham who was the hamburger guy I thought he was great heat hero

1675
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,960
Who was the disco guy Kelly who was a fetishist? She was a slut basically

1676
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,760
He had kitty and kitty Nakajima

1677
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:01,280
Who was sort of like I guess like the she was in some Senshi, you know TV show

1678
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,880
Pinky who's a stripper and she's actually pretty cool shorty. Who's the little girl?

1679
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:14,760
And you had strike who's the sort of gangster sort of and then you had hidden characters like you had burger dog who used hands

1680
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:22,320
Dance moves who's in hand stage capoeira which were two silver aliens that did capoeira style dancing

1681
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:29,000
Columbo that was shorty's pet mouse and robo zee who was actually the the boss of the game and

1682
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:34,840
When you fight robo zee robo zee's like a really freakin tall and you're like, oh my god

1683
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:39,720
she's like a really freakin tall and you're like maybe the size of a finger and

1684
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:47,920
You're actually on top of the building and it's in the middle of the street causing accidents and wrecks. Hey, it's it's um, capoeira

1685
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,880
but

1686
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,880
Capoeira was also

1687
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:57,560
Called Kiki and Lala which I thought was pretty funny. So when the game came out in the US they

1688
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:12,200
See, this is the good version if you can turn up a little bit. Okay, this is they played this song in English and it sucked. The woman could not sing for crap.

1689
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:18,960
They actually did they edit it quite a bit like when strike comes out you drink from a flask and

1690
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:26,880
And um, they change it to a can of coke they took out hero's cigarette they changed certain lyrics for being I guess

1691
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:31,160
Racially charged and also removed references to McDonald's and Burger King

1692
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,920
They like I said, they did some of the songs in English which just was awful

1693
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,760
Oh my god, they left fritas in Japanese, which I don't understand

1694
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,160
and then

1695
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:48,880
And also with the stages though is that if you did a

1696
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:56,320
7-point combo which you know that was getting up to the most difficult stage of doing those special combos

1697
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:03,520
You could get the levels to do like neat stuff like for this stage here capoeira stage the doors would pop off and you'd either

1698
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,960
Be in the air you'd be in outer space depending

1699
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:11,720
If you play shorty and pull one off her mouse jumps out of her pocket starts dancing with her

1700
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:16,560
Um, this game is so it's just really one of my okay

1701
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,560
I first played this when someone brought over

1702
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:25,760
Their copy that it only been at like a week in Japan and I imported it like as soon as payday hit

1703
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:32,660
Um, I know this bugs you when I call it this but bust a move too was my first rhythm game ever here in the u.s

1704
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:37,860
And that that you know without that game. I probably would not be here on orange lawns radio today. So I

1705
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,520
Totally love this series as well

1706
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:47,200
best to move to and I've and the reason why I'm not really combining them is because actually best to move to

1707
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,440
To me is sort of a different game

1708
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,680
because

1709
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:56,580
Each character had their own set of special commands instead of having

1710
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:02,120
Everyone having the same move, which is why you can play best to move in

1711
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:10,480
Without the commands because everybody had the same damn commands and I actually had one of the first English fan sites on this game

1712
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:16,000
And it's gone. It's been dead. But the link is still on the anime web turnpike if that's any any

1713
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,960
Indication of how long I've had that site fever time. Yeah character does really well

1714
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,500
They get to bust out of solo. It's pretty awesome. And the endings are funny, too

1715
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:31,240
but best to move to had individual moves for everybody had

1716
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,800
Easy mode which it was all just using fans with the arrows

1717
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:41,320
You had the medium mode which is plays pretty much just like the first bus to move and he had mix mode which uses

1718
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:46,320
The triangle scored everything and you also had attacks too, which you if you timed your tag

1719
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,760
Just right you could completely botched their entire solo

1720
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,760
Now really quickly here before we go to break because we got to kind of wrap the segment up

1721
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:57,940
Why do you think this series kind of died off because you know, we had these games we had dance summit

1722
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:59,940
Which was kind of met, you know

1723
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,740
It's just it wasn't really the same. Why did this series?

1724
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:08,580
Why haven't we seen more games in this series, especially with how popular music games have been in this day and age?

1725
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:13,820
Because annex needs to get off their ass and just to do it, you know, we never got dance summit over here

1726
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:19,740
And just to let and to give people a quick explanation dance summit is actually sort of a teen dance game

1727
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,340
where you have team versus team and

1728
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:27,160
Based on whatever your command button is at the end of your sequence

1729
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:31,700
You have different people in your team that do different dance moves and different solo moves

1730
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,580
we have like a bunch of people that look like heat from the first one and

1731
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:40,320
it was a lot more interactive and had really good music and it even had a special controller that came out with it that had

1732
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:46,620
something that you wear sort of like a grip that you would push the buttons and hold it sideways and

1733
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:52,700
They really tried to innovate the series and I thought the best remove too was going in the right direction

1734
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,940
But they haven't done anything else with it

1735
01:29:55,940 --> 01:30:02,820
I think that maybe because of how poorly dance summit did that maybe they thought that it was just time to end the series

1736
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,820
I don't know sad, but

1737
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:09,640
What they need to do is go back and do another one that plays like best move to

1738
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:16,020
All right, we gotta wrap up but that is your classic game of the week folks. It is bust a move

1739
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:20,540
How can you not like a game that has a gigantic voguing robot or if you're here in the u.s

1740
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:24,660
You find it under bust a groove because I guess the name bust a move is already ten toward it

1741
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,660
I

1742
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:32,140
Didn't think the US version I had the US version of bust a bust a groove to I guess you could say it wasn't that

1743
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:36,020
Bad I mean for you know Rob's first music game because I didn't know what else was out there

1744
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:38,020
I had a blast with it, you know

1745
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:44,740
According to sauce the series died off because people suck. I guess that is true real quickly called tippo and chat asked

1746
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:46,740
What could they put in a bust a groove sequel?

1747
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:53,560
Honestly, just more the same on next-gen get rid of online Xbox live get rid of bio bring that gas. Oh

1748
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:57,600
Yeah, here's a great the Xbox what a great Xbox live arcade game

1749
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:02,040
This might make that would be good and you know what they should have. I think hmm. They should have

1750
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,840
You know, you can do create about rest, you know in wrestling games

1751
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:10,500
You can do create a wrestler and customize all of their moves every single one based on what you put

1752
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,280
all you have to do is

1753
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:18,440
have a create a dancer mode and you'd give them different combo moves or give them a style of dance and

1754
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:26,360
What you do is you go in and make your character the way you want them to and then give a sign their style of dance

1755
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,080
All right. I think that that should come out another dream game

1756
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:31,800
All right

1757
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,680
There you have it here on orange lounge radio your classic game of the week

1758
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,600
Bust a move or bust a groove depending on where you live. Did you at Loki? You've been awfully quiet

1759
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:42,200
Did you ever play that series? I would think you've probably touched that at some point. I played a demo of

1760
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:49,200
Bust a groove just wasn't the same thing. It was just didn't like it as much because there wasn't actual you didn't actually dance or anything

1761
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,200
You know, it's just kind of

1762
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:56,940
Can't please everybody. That's all right. All right, we are gonna take a quick break here on orange lounge radio

1763
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,780
