{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly to listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast We now tape live on all games.com every Sunday night. We got a small little crowd Hello to everybody in our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com Who are listening to us and our brand new sound quality as well lots of compliments on the sound of the show tonight We're excited to be here. We got lots more stuff for you in part B more gaming news We have the mailbag we're giving away a stupid award tonight And we've got an interview with somebody pretty rad of Farb's the man behind Rom check fail will be talking to him very shortly but first more gaming news Yes, loki. Yes, all right anyways So this is not big surprise because we've been Seeing sorts of similar bands with other rock star games, but this time brazil has banned bully Of course you know before the whole banning problem was manhunt 2 now for whatever reason they've deemed it inappropriate for sale and The ban has prevented the game from being imported distributed sold or promoted on the websites and stores in the country apparently Brazilian distributors retailers will have 30 days to comply with the ban and it came in response to The requests of the Brazilian youth center it said the aggravating factor is that everything in the game takes place inside a school and that's not acceptable, so apparently of course take two has They said it will not have a material impact on the sales of their popular title Doesn't sound like that. They're going to appeal it, so You're in brazil and you want to play bully. Oh well guess you're out of luck You might have to import it or something huh not that I don't think you're missing a whole lot, but you know Now what's weird to me this game is somewhat old, so are we talking like all the way back to the PlayStation 2 version? No, this is a scholarship edition So it's stupid though because the game has been out. I was going to say the game's already been out, so what's the big difference? It's not like this games like an M rated game or anything This is like a teen rated game over here, so I don't understand what the big deal is. Oh, it's this school Oh, that's why oh, I'm sorry It's a school. Did you actually play they haven't played the game? They didn't see like what contents in the game They're just oh because it's cool and bullies in tile must be because you're a bully and So we don't like it. I'd be curious to hear and I know we've got to have some listeners in Brazil I got because we got listeners from around the world I'd be kind of curious to hear this from their perspective And I want to know can you go walk in to you know your big game stores there? I mean, I don't know if you have the same type of things we do only have 30 days to comply so go quick I'm curious. Can you walk into a store and buy bully on the PlayStation 2 or have you been able to do that in the past? That's why I'm kind of curious about so We'll see. I don't know dark soccer. What do you think about banning video games in countries? Retarded yeah, I mean is there I I think that banning anything is Unless we're banning the ferret. No just kidding. I I understand to an extent why people Why things are illegal you know why? certain Things that they think might be harmful to the development of children But you know I believe that it's not the government's place to decide. It's the parents place to decide I Guess despite all our I guess despite all our bitching in part a about the way society is right now I guess we should be thankful where we live in a place where at least we have that decision to make Where you don't see the country banning things if they'll just give a shit for it. Oh well, yeah So all right well moving on to other you know I don't know if I'd would call this happy news I don't think it's really happy for these people that we're working at develop develop was a gaming company and Unfortunately they have just lost some projects because the staff was cut from 25 down to just six senior staff President Michael scandizzo though says I guess he's optimistic He says if somebody came in tomorrow and said here's a whole bunch of money Can you get back up and running then by Monday we could be at back up and running it would have to be soon But if anybody wanted to come in and save us We'd give the whole kitchen sink to them to them on the extremely cheap Otherwise after almost 10 years of this group working together. We're going to have to dissolve Developed was formed in 2003 and it was a bunch of people that used to work for Blizzard But here's here's the punchline the only game that's come out of develop Yaris So if you were hoping for Yaris to I don't know if that's really gonna happen now I guess I kind of feel bad for these guys though because they were they were probably paid a crap load of money for what? Couldn't have been a too difficult a game. They might have had all these other projects We'll never know about that could have been pretty rad and they couldn't get one, right? But I mean it was Yaris come on Yaris too, then you're probably a masochist Well, I don't know a juiced in and chat says let them die I chat that orange songs radio.com if you want to participate can't save them all I guess that's true. Don't worry EA is hiring right just kidding Anyway, can I get can I yes, you have some good news We actually have a video now of a new character for Street Fighter 4 Who is named Rufus and he's actually bigger than e Honda And he's supposedly really fast for being bigger than e Honda so Interesting there's also another character called el fuerte Who is supposed to be just a overall playable character I don't really see anything though about how the character moves. He's a Mexican wrestler. Hey, that's cool I like I like the luchadors. He's actually pretty fast. I've watched some gameplay footage of him Now Rufus, so that guy is he's pretty fat. He kind of reminds me a lot of oh God, who is the character that they just added in Tekken 6 the one that was really like Bob? Yeah, it kind of looks like Bob but with like a ponytail and just like he's got amazing Gut physics. He looks like Jack Black and nacho libre DJ janae in chat says king hippo is the king of fat dude characters and games. Yes true statement Whatever happened to king hippo. Oh Okay, so I'm looking at this el fuerte. Mm-hmm, and he's actually pretty cool He fights very much in a from sort of a vega style I'm thinking but it is very Yeah, dark Tetsuya and Chad it throws back to another Capcom classic says he reminds me of one of the characters in slam masters Remember Saturday night slam masters. Oh my god. This guy is it was fun Hideously fast. He actually surmised me. Who was that guy from art of fighting that would throw cookies. Oh God, I don't remember where the green outfit and suspenders. No, that was a That was that was Chang that was a fatal fury fatal. Fury was hairy was named Chang. Yeah something something Yeah, I know you're talking about Yes, he threw cookies Rufus is kind of like if I kept eating and eating and eating and eating then became a fighter He he he he has jiggle. He has belly jiggle Don't you see? He looks like pom-pom in A home star runner. All right, a lot lots of diverse characters apparently coming to Street Fighter 4 I'm kind of excited by this. It sounds like there's a lot of people in Street Fighter 4 I mean not only do you have the original fighters and I have some of these new people too We have the crevice and Viper, you know other people we've heard about in previous shows So Street Fighter 4 is gonna be a good time. Yeah, I hope now the question but the question is will it blend? Well, it blends maybe I don't know if Rufus can fit in the blender Now this is interesting and you know, once again goes to show you that The Sony platforms are just not Not that safe against hackers Apparently though there's been a tool that's been developed called ps3 proxy and what this program has done is actually allowed people to Be able to download the PlayStation home beta without actually having to participate in the beta. So they're able to Modify a few files that they've downloaded from a server to allow them to download the beta even though it's not available to them Word is right now though that you're unable to actually play the beta But there has been some video of people that have been able to play the beta Despite the fact that it was previously thought you couldn't but either way though The thought is that it's gonna be public pretty soon anyways So might as well just wait a few weeks, you know for it to come out But in the meantime though, it's very interesting though that you can download it as it you know It's not that difficult from what I was reading into I just haven't gone around to actually trying it yet Where is freaking home already? I mean they've been talking about this for over a year now, you know And we have yet to really see much more than screenshots Well, that's it's probably hanging out with spore and I'm sorry, but that's the same do them forever You know what PlayStation I have you know, and I'm not gonna just dig on place, you know Sony with this but the PlayStation 3 they've been like touting a lot of features as they say they haven't arrived yet like home You know, there are new games like hell mill yourself for even going as far as like Final Fantasy 13 Which is not scheduled to be out here for a few years now It's just like stuff like this. They're like, oh, hey. Yeah, this says it's coming like coming It's right around the corner, but really it's not right around the corner You know and even Microsoft's kind of guilty of this too with the whole XNA thing Yeah, that's cool that they showed us that little snippet around You know game developers conference in that kind of time, but once it actually coming out not for a while So that's kind of lame and then you know with Nintendo and the whole WiiWare service Yeah, they've been teasing that for a long time and I good point. I guess it's not just Sony It's just easy to pick on Sony for whatever reason. Well, yeah, but at least they've given us a date on WiiWare of sorts Yeah, I guess I could always put it back. I don't think they will this one I mean WiiWare is out now in Japan it is out. But what's the kind of release schedule? What are we looking at? Okay, they release like say eight games or something. How many months do we have to wait for the next games that come out? I mean, it's not like a typical Nintendo timeframes Not like live arcade where three months for a B title another three months for a B title in about nine months You'll get your a-list title We have a spider in the studio and it's driving me crazy I need Loki to do something about that or you are you bug phobic step on it kill it You know what? I hate worse than spiders. What's that? Mosquito Hawks? That's what we get for having that door open to get some of the cool air in here Mosquito Hawks that moment of total randomness brought to you by orange lounge radio back to the gaming news And we are one less spider in the studio. Sorry spider Sega things things aren't too good at Sega sadly Sega Racing Studio has Closed they're gone. They had more than 60 employees at one point They've really only created one title since they formed in 2005 Sega closed it There was this comment that Sega gave to next-gen quote the decision is part of a review of Sega's Western Development Studios to ensure that each studio is profitable entity in its own right and Unfortunately, the Sega Racing Studios five-year plan would not result in a successful return for the Sega business moving forward Or you could probably just look at the sales of Sega rally revo because that's the one game they made and sadly, I I think it was just Especially in racing. It's so competitive right now with these next-gen systems. There are so many racing games out there right now, right? I mean look at what they have on you know, these next-gen systems, you know They got it's just on the Xbox 360. You had games like full auto test drive for za Burnout I can go on and on for a dirt, you know, just tons and tons of racing games This is just a very competitive market So that's that's two studios closed in a week sad both racing games. Mm-hmm Yaris was a game. Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't really call Yaris I wouldn't put that quite on the same level as Sega But it's just kind of like potential you would think potential by the way going back to something We were bringing up a little bit earlier I know I'm a little late on this but the Rob D is a fighting game guru and he said the character green guy throws cookies Chang's Shinzan that was it Chang's Shinzan. There it is. Couldn't remember the full name. We had a fatal fury special at my school I never played Chang anyway, it was all about Kim kap won Actually, I have to agree with you. It was him and my were always the ones I'd use and Yuri's butt attack She had butt attack and that was great Any character who attacks with her butt except there is a fighting game That has a character that fights with her butt and the game kind of sucked and that was the Sailor Moon super s fighting game So which is which was the first game I've ever imported It was a Sailor Moon fighting game. Nice. Very nice. So now that we have this little tidbit about me Going back over as far as the rumor mill is concerned There has been rumored a a New Ace attorney game to be coming out Um that has been called um, Gakuten Saiban perfect prosecutor and it should be starring Edgeworth objection overruled Well, you said it was a rumor so I thought I would object but I You know these people that love the ace attorney series love the ace attorney series I have a friend who is sucked into the series. There's like manga and everything Yeah, um, but um, they're actually the it came across from some scans in Famitsu So, um, you're you remember Shane used to come on this program a bit a long time ago. I don't remember mr. High musical I'm reminding the listeners right me glattov so and so on who used to work in on mr. High school music Okay, he played he plays World of Warcraft with us, right and he joins ventrilo the chatting You know how like in ventrilo whenever it joins you have that little robotic voice that says, you know Rob has joined the server you can put in whatever you know name you want his thing whenever he joins the server goes Apollo justice is sexy has connected Just cracks me up, but I'm telling you people that are really into Apollo justice are really into it Hey something a lot of us are into this week is rom check fail a couple weeks ago a little independent game called a rom Check fail swept gaming blogs everywhere rom check fail takes several classic video games such as Super Mario Brothers Asteroids pac-man throws them all into a blender basically resulting in unique and nostalgic Gameplay basically kind of what you do in this game. Is that one minute you might be Zelda in a Mario level and you're trying to stab the asteroids with your sword It would be link, but then the next minute well, you know what I mean, but then the next minute you are You're you're in the asteroids level and then suddenly you're pac-man You have to find the dot on the screen to eat the things from kicks are flying around the screen But when you find it they turn into blue ghosts. It's excellent. I love it The man behind rom check fail is Farb's and we got in touch with him this week And we're excited to have him on the show tonight, so let's go to the phones all the way to Australia Where Farb's is from let's get him on the line all right. Hello Farb's are you there? Hi, yeah, hey, how you doing Farb's? I'm not bad not bad all right So you're the guy that wrote rom check fail was this is was it a solo effort Did you do this all yourself or how did this happen? Yeah, yeah, no usually I work alone um It's just easier that way coordinating the project between multiple people way too hard especially when you want to do something a bit silly How long did it take you to do the whole thing? Well, I'm not sure if you saw but it was part of the video game named generator contest over So so the whole thing had to be completed in three weeks, which is why it's it's pretty small game But you know that's why wow it's very impressive considering. It was done in three weeks I I had heard it was it was like the the winner didn't you end up winning that competition too? I? Did I did so well congratulations? Well well deserved how did it get from? Competition rules to this finished product like whether where there are certain rules that made you want to go in this direction of developing This game or what happened I? Think you tapped into a little bit of controversy there because the the contest had one rule that you had to use this video game named generator Websites come up with a name for your game, and then make that and that's something I didn't actually do so What happened you get a really bad name out of it or something? No, I know what happened was I am I kind of started in that direction, so I started sort of looking at the generator Running it a couple times coming up with different names having to think about how it works and thinking about ways that I could Hook in an exciting game with that right and what I saw pretty quickly was that the generator was It was coming up with a couple of different concepts and just kind of mashing them together Which if you played ROM check file you'll see is certainly a part of ROM check file So anyway, I saw that and I thought hey You know what would be awesome is a game that actually generates lots of the games that come out of the generator so you know That's pretty funny. It's kind of it's telling you through all these games It's like you throw all these games in a blender and out comes this so it Wasn't necessarily that you had the idea to begin with the the blending of the names kind of inspired the blended game idea Yeah, totally so I was going to do stuff that actually came out of the generator But I realized possibly also with the help of some advice from a friend that When somebody sees an emu on the screen and and there's a dragonfly, but I don't know what that means right whereas If they see Mario, and they see some space invaders. They totally get that immediately Well, I don't know the first time I played ROM check fail. It took me a minute to get it But but just imagine how much would have been if you didn't actually know what the characters were all the ways that they interacted with each other so Not only was it kind of tapping into the whole nostalgia vibe But it but it also communicated to the player much more quickly what the hell was going on I guess that's a very good point because you know eventually kind of figure out okay if I'm pac-man right now I better eat this dot before I try to touch something or I'm gonna be in trouble. So yeah, do you think that's right? Whereas if you were a penguin and you had to go pick up a water lily before you could eat things you You would never think of that Unless I was playing the penguin and water lily game. I don't know Maybe it would be in the title Do you think it's that nostalgia is the part of the reason why this game is just kind of like spread like wildfire amongst all The gaming blogs and the internet and kind of like caught on I think that has helped a lot. Yeah, um Which is a shame because that's not really what the game was meant to be about but you know, I'll take it What what is the game meant to be about? Well, whenever I make a game, I usually think about it Just starting with a gameplay concept first. So I think about the way that the game's gonna play I don't really think too much about what it looks like or the narrative or anything like that And this game like I was saying was about matching different kind of Archetypal characters together just kind of throwing them in a scene saying deal with it Um, what was the question again? No, that's okay. Um, what like Um, I guess we were talking about the that is spreading along the blogs and it's kind of like wildfire and the nostalgia Is the nostalgia part of you know, why this game you think is caught on so so popular? Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, I think I think that's half of it. Um Because I mean you look around you you're gonna find a lot of games that that are You're gonna find a lot of games that that take mario sprites and chuck them in a game or or that kind of thing Um, so it's not not unique in in the first thing What's largely unique is the way that it uses them and the fact that there is a playable game underneath Absolutely. Did you have to recreate all of the the the mario and I I don't know if this might be a controversial thing I'm asking so you can feel free to say no comment But did you have to recreate all those sprites and the music and everything or did you were you able to kind of? I don't know. I guess borrow from the games that were already out there How much of this did you have to kind of build from scratch? uh, well Strangely enough this actually took most of my time like recreating the the gameplay interactions and things was very quick when I was just using a bunch of squares, but Once I started looking at the the proper sprites from all the games and the sounds and everything It was a huge process to um To pull it all together and it came from whatever source I could find first to be honest So there's there's a lot of sprite rip pages that I used. So thanks to everybody who put those together Um, all the music came from different people's websites where they they've sort of re-orchestrated tunes Which I then tweaked a little bit to make them sound a little bit more like each other And cut them up and pasted them together. So it was I like to think of it as a collaborative effort from the entire internet retro gaming community I was gonna say i'm thinking this isn't my name's on the credits. This isn't just like a hodgepodge of a game It's also kind of a mixture of all these different contributions that are already out there on the internet So some guy who ripped zelda sprites might have helped with this game and didn't even know it Um, yep. Yep, since this game's kind of spread all around the internet, you know You gotta love the way the internet kind of reacts to things and i'm sure your email box has been starting to get some Emails about rom check fail if you've gotten any kind of like crazy feedback about the game or what's like the craziest thing You've gotten in response to the game Uh, actually I haven't really got much back from it, which is which is a bit surprising Um, I think a lot of people play the game through a direct link So they don't even see my website and people who do even like pick it up by going through my website Don't don't think to email me. So it's been a bit quiet. I mean the the tig source feedback threads have been great um But unless i've explicitly asked people to talk about my game it's usually been a bit quiet Well, that's a damn shame. We need to get some of our listeners to send Love for making this game for free as part of a competition. So listeners send farb's little love Where's the website they can get in touch with you? Oh, uh, www.farb's.org f a r b s excellent Do you have any uh future projects you can talk about things that might be coming to the website soon? Because you have some other games already on the website, too This isn't the only thing you've ever done you have some other games as well But um, do you have anything in the future? You might want to give us some hints about uh I would love to but unfortunately i'm still deciding what i'm gonna do next I mean i've got i've always got about a dozen ideas kind of floating around bumping into each other and it usually takes Something to actually push me to put something together as a game. So the uh, the vgng compo was great for me because I I had You know some concept about games that I wanted to make Suddenly I had a three-week deadline to actually do something and so I got something done Whereas now i'm back in that phase of sort of thinking. Oh, I don't know what I want to do next So there will be games coming I can promise you that But I have no idea which ones excellent. Well here, you know something we at orange launch radio Have been talking about our dream game for a long time, you know I'll just kind of throw it out there if you can make a game with cats wielding lasers at each other Might be an amazing game. So just give me something to think about maybe for the sequel Now something we always ask all of our guests that come on the program because you know, we're all gamers What kind of video games have you been playing this week? Have you been playing independent games you a console gamer pc gamer? What kind of games you've been playing this week? Uh, this week's been very quiet for me. I've uh, I've been a bit busy. So I haven't haven't been able to get into any massive titles. So Mostly for me it's been just sort of picking up indie titles because usually you can kind of pick them up have a bit of A play and then and then put them down again because they're not very large Um other than that bit of smash brothers friend of mine imported it so we were actually able to play it which is nice Awesome, nothing big very cool. Do you find yourself drawn to other indie games? Do you like to kind of sample what else is out there in the indie world? Yeah, I like to but but like I said, I mean i'm interested in gameplay mechanics and you're going to see a lot more variation in that kind of stuff in indie games, but also They're they're small and disposable and that that's really great when you've you know, got 10 minutes free Uh, it's a lot better than thinking. Oh i've got 10 minutes free. I'm going to start morrowind that that doesn't add up Exactly, um, I got one more question for you and this might be opening a big can of worms But it's something we've been kind of talking about a little bit in the past on this program And that would be kind of the future of uh console, you know gaming as we see these more Independent scene friendly things start to open up such as xna and we wear and things like that From your viewpoint as somebody who's been kind of developing independent games. What do you do? Do you think that? Xna and the these things that are going to make uh console development a little more accessible to the indie developer Do you think this is going to be the next big thing in gaming? Do you think this is going to take off or do you think? Yeah, this pc is always where it's really going to be at Well, I think uh the the the xna thing that they're coming up with where pretty much any game can get Distributed is is definitely going to be interesting. Um, but in that sense, I think it's just going to really look a lot more like pc I don't think we're ever going to really hit that that kind of wonderland that all all indie game developers Hope will one day open up where you know, you can make a game in three months by yourself And push it out on a console and suddenly make millions and millions of dollars. I mean those those opportunities pop up occasionally But they're extremely rare. So I don't know. I I think it'll open up a bit more. I think it'll become a little bit more like pc But I don't think we'll see any major changes All right. Well farbs. Thanks so much for joining us all the way from australia tonight. We really appreciate it farbs He is the man that wrote rom check fail it check him out Www.farbz.org and you can download other games as well. Not just rom check fails. So check that out Farbz, thanks so much for being with us tonight All right. Cheers. All right. Take care I I want to listen to him talk some more. That was really cool. Sorry. He's gone now So yeah, but yeah, it's something about accents aren't isn't there but I I want I want I want laser capture And and he's quite talented. I mean rom check. I was very surprised I mean, I kind of knew going into that interview that rom check fail was done by pretty much one guy But that's still very impressive, you know, i'm always impressed by some of the levels of talent out there Well, best of luck to farbz and thanks for taking the kind of time to come on the show. We appreciate it Are you a big fan of rom check fail loki? I think you were the one that showed that to me first played it a bit Yeah, I don't know. It's one of those games that you can play for just a little bit and then Leave it for a while. It's like the game that made me go What is that music and then I realized it was marble madness. It's like it's like WarioWare type of thing like as long as you could just play for like a little bit and it's like total crack and fun You're like, okay. It's like it's a good like micro game like the c1 that it was just all like nintendo stuff like, you know mega man with mario's all the Well, he might hit copyright issues with that. I mean, well, I guess he already is. Yeah, who cares? That's true Okay, make something for we wear or something. That's why you need to do it like all underground, you know And don't say who you are and just throw it out there on like, you know, the bit torrent Well, I would gather farb's is probably not his real name. Well, I'm just saying speculation I'm just saying though instead of like having a website and stuff because if you do it all underground and stuff like that They can't really stop yet. I mean, especially if you just kind of throw it out there, you know, just let it catch the current All right. Well, we want to thank farms again for taking the time to come on the show All the time away from developing new games for us more crack for us later on. All right, let's get back to the show Later on. All right. Let's get back into the gaming news. Loki take it away. All right. So here's another rumor that's coming around That's not a big surprise But um, i'm interested in to see that they're actually kind of going this route or maybe thinking going this route Um rumor is that microsoft course is good looking into creating a wiimote like device for the xbox 360 Uh, the motion controller is going to be codenamed newton and uh No word on what exactly this might be Uh something though it will use a like a usb powered sensor bar and it will possibly have rumble motors as well as um, a microphone built in for voice activated games, so It's interesting that they might be going this route and the same way I kind of think you know It's not a little copy cat-ish a little bit, but everybody kind of copies everybody at some point. So And I know microsoft has had Not great success trying to tap that family market and stuff that nintendo has but Well seen it hasn't done bad for them I mean, you know, even though amongst the hardcore we kind of all turn our noses at it and go it's kind of dumb But apparently it's been doing fairly well for them. So who knows? I don't think as well as like say we sports or something like that. No, I don't think well I don't you just never know with microsoft I know with microsoft microsoft kind of has a way of taking it at somebody else's idea and kicking it up a notch You know what? I mean, but can you imagine though just if you will like motion controlled games with 360s graphics. Yeah, I mean that'd be fucking awesome. I don't know. Uh, what do you think dark sakura? Do you think uh, Do you think it could be successful motion control on the 360 or and I open this up to chat, too What do you guys think of it? Do you think it could be successful in the 360 or is it gonna feel like a cheap knockoff of wii? I really don't think it would be that difficult to integrate Into um, the 360 because really all you need is just the uh, the input device, you know The the thing you need your sensor bar, of course Oh there went my power plug again, um, I don't think that it's it's going to I really don't think that it's going to be That sort of cheap knockoff thing, but I think people are going to have a preconceived notion About how it's supposed to work because they have this experience with the wii You know, I think it's really all about the games It really is, you know, depending on what they release with it And if they've been paying any attention to the wii they're going to take something like wii sports or carnival games and really kick it Up a notch and uh, it might do very well. This is a chance to either sink or bail with it I mean, I mean sink or swim with it. I mean and if they swim they'll be you know, because Microsoft they'll be walking on water Comments from chat room chat.orangelaundry.com RawstealUT is predicting that newton much like xbox live vision will have incredibly limited use That is the problem. I mean at least nintendo built their whole console around the concept so, you know, the game's integrated VxjasonXV our fearless webmaster says Microsoft wants to tap that Gerardimo says I want motion control res. Oh or space channel 5 does come to xbox live arcade do want motion control Choo, choo, you never know it'll be interesting. So I just you said that I was already starting to think of samba D'amigo the one we with the posing well, they are doing that I know that's what I started thinking of doing your bizarro little poses Uh juiceton says imagine a game that requires the camera and the motion controller Good idea, but imagine the highly limited audience that's going to reach unless xbox then puts out a you know Another bundle that comes with both which I guess is is very possible. I don't know Who knows? So, uh, we'll continue on with the gaming news and I want to talk about metal gear solid online, you know over here Uh, you had to pre-order the game in order to get the metal gear online demo, but guess what? In the european playstation store metal gear online premiere beta free download on the playstation store April 17th to may 6th in europe So if you live in europe, you don't even have to pre-order although I imagine you know logic You know, usually this is the type of thing that would make us go woohoo free things are awesome But then again, I go I imagine most metal gear fans Probably pre-ordered the game anyway, so I can't imagine there's that many people but at the same time There might be some casual fans like for instance You know if if this were happening in the us I go Hmm free beta i'll download it and check it out. I may not be into metal gear that much but hey if it's free That gives me incentive to take a look Right rob what imagine technical, um, uh, the imagine babies. No Imagine not stumbling over your words imagine Uh tactical espionage action sounds like fun though babies babies with babies Yes a tactical espionage baby game metal gear bailey A tactical espionage baby game metal gear bailey metal gear babies Maybe that'll be you know, because they have the flash forward in metal gear 4 Maybe that'll be a metal gear 5 flash backwards. By the way, the beta is running from april 21st to may 6th Uh, which by the way happens to be one day less than we have it in north america. Hmm Something is afoot maybe all the uh Maybe all the european fandom over the years for sony is paying off. Who knows anyhow? Your fandom pays off every week when you send us emails to our address mailbag at orange laundry.com We love getting your emails and uh, just yes, we do dark sakura. Just say it. Yes, we do Even though we've moved over to all games.com now We move the mailbag with us and it's still the same email address mailbag at orange laundry.com Let's open up the mailbag and check out some of the email that came in since last week's show dark. Sakura Dive in head first. Will you into the mailbag and pull out some of your favorites? No, because there might be an anvil in there or something Or a spider. Oh, okay. So um first, um Email of the evening is from trisha licious That's a cool name trisha licious. I hate to say it. Oh, i'm gonna i'm gonna make us lose a fan But it does sound like a stripper name Dear olr, just picture the guns and roses in the background now taking the stage trisha licious on my ipod I thought I would ask you about a recent game I purchased and I had to buy it from an online retailer after reading a review in game informer magazine about pinball hall of fame The williams collection which received a high rating and for only being 30 bucks. I knew I had to have it I proceeded to my local gaming shop expecting them to have the game since it was Reviewed in their magazine, but nothing was on the shelf or listed in their computer database When I finally got the game after buying it online, I lo- I loaded it up and started playing Phf on my wii is the best pinball I have played on a pc or console I wanted to try to get the word out that this game really kicks major butt as a pinball simulator I love it and I want to make sure those all those who also love pinball to give it a try Now I want to go play these tables all over again if I can find them at a local arcade The local arcade love to you all huggies trishalicious Pinball is awesome Pinball is the best ever, you know, I downloaded a new table for pinball fx on xbox live this week the uh, buccaneer table Yeah, uh, but I didn't get a chance to play because I was down with that rocky and bullwinkle table but I got sidetracked my whole fantasy star universe thing, but I Trishalish is not the first person to point out that that's a fun game But I bet you especially would enjoy that you pinball whore really? Yes. Good times. Yes. All right How can they release a pinball collection a williams pinball collection and us not have it just just just checking? Okay, then. I'm What I was shaking my head anyway next email is Is kamatari's forever is who that is Hey, olr. Love your show been listening for about a month and one and wondering a few things Is the ferret still there from your transition to all games? That answer your question That would make me sad if it were shipped away into a box I've also heard rumors that konami will make a ddr 10th anniversary game sometime around this or next year Could that be plausible due to licensing fees and whatnot? Just want to know I could see it being plausible since they're probably running out of ideas for new ddr games anyways Yeah, there's not like too much they can do to revise. So let's put a new ddr game with all the classic konami songs Wait, that's like every other ddr game What I think that they should do if they did like an anniversary edition is to have you be able to choose your mode That you play in so you can actually load up the very first ddr and have to do your little jumps around for your codes and shit and have it all be Unvivid and you know instead have like second mix mode where you have dance battle pop-up because you know dance battle was the best thing about about second mix and You know, you should do stuff like that like a third mix have paint mode or something, you know stuff like an SSR Whoops Or you can dance to this song What a hoe down? Anyway Hope that's what I get for leaving things running Can I be, do you have something to say about It would not be a first show on all games if I didn't screw up somehow. So there you have it Do you have something to say about the ditter? Look, I've been saying forever if ddr wants to evolve the game needs to be they need to scrap all their old code Rebuild the game from the ground up Honestly make it look like guitar hero at this point I think that's the best way to make a catch on here in the US. I hate to say it How about okay? How about this? You just totally ignore like all the like tutorials and Get rid of quest mode for the love of God quest mode is Crap or redo quest I think quest mode has potential to be good No, no, but not in its current form quest mode is crap what they need to have bring challenge mode back That's fine. The challenge modes. I think are a lot more fun or Challenging than quest mode quest mode is like okay play allows on go. Oh Oh fun Nothing like repetition. I just think if they want the DER to continue they should you know remit I've said it for years. They need to make DDR take it from being cooperative and making competitive But that's just me or have like new modifiers that are song specific that like certain things happen in the song Maybe integrated with like, you know videos or something that are playing like the arrows fall down different ways or something like that I mean, which would be pretty cool like different themes All right, next email next email is As soon as it loads up Next email comes to us from Harvey. Oh Sorry, it comes just from a poorly formatted email. Um, I'm Okay, I'm just gonna say Harvey was the last name because they put their full name in there. So that's what I'm gonna say Um, hey, what's up, Ol R. I was wondering what do you think about Sony saying DualShock? Wouldn't fit in a 6-axis controller and now it's there. How ironic they didn't ever say it wouldn't fit just they Couldn't do it at the same time with the tilt and it's so last Yeah, I mean and it's actually the same shell. In fact, there's actually spots for the two rumble motors. So That's bullshit. Do you think that redesigning the PSN store will affect the amount of content that is bought? Will you guys be buying any games from the new we wear section next month? Also do like 365 give dark soccer a cookie. I Will make it one of my goals as a gamer to give her a cookie Dude cookies are great, but you have to get it to me by next weekend Because it's your birthday. It's my birthday. That's right. I mean, whatever I want to cookies and booze Life is five did not give you a cookie. In fact, they gave me a migraine Uh Yeah, I Want to they owe me a cookie and then they owe Rob money as far as we wear. Yes I'm hoping there's some movies or something gameplay videos that make its way to the US sites I can learn a little more about these games Than just having to take a leap of faith. You know, I mean that game just like well, yeah Okay, maybe there's certain cases where I would take a leap of faith and like I already know I want that. Dr Mario game especially it has like the online and everything but you know some of those old ones like even like Final Fantasy I'm kind of like Honest, I don't know if I have the room on my Wii hard drive to fit that stuff You know how many freaking virtual console games I have a sad amount sad amount well This person has listed gamer goals and I have to read some of these because I have to respond to some of them Okay gamer goals.

Anyway, I'm happy you switched seamlessly, but down to business I want to ask you guys are you actually going to air the fuck show and when? Looking forward to it. Thanks for your time Zeppelin. Yeah, remember that we were supposed to do the fuck show Fucking hell, I don't know if that's actually gonna happen next week I just because I'm gonna be out of town most of the weekend and it's just it's We can't say when it's gonna happen. We got to pick a show and not tell you I like that idea It should just fucking happen whenever the fuck I The fuck show will happen. It won't happen next week, but it'll happen before summer Is that weird? Yeah, we have to have one listener in on it just because they have to keep tally, but Well, we'll tell dark Tetsuya or somebody, you know, who's been listening forever that we know is good gonna do a good job Keeping tally. But yeah, if you don't know what the fuck show is you listen last week's show It's this completely idiotic and stupid idea. We had that is so funny It makes us giggle like in only places that what they play calm snap can By the way, how much do I love the wiki editors? The people that work on our wiki which is the orange lounge radio dot wiki calm How much do I love them especially namely and a lot of people are getting in on it now? But namely AJ mix and dark Tetsuya have been doing probably about 80% of the work. If not a little more. I love this here's the summary you go in oops you go into the page that says dream games, right and Let's see. We have they're all accounted for Sky's voice the game laser cats Loki's world of randomness rice princess presents boobies and pandas forbidden Bomberman pen and paper furries and then cosplayers versus furries and here's the new entry what they play calm snap a Nintendo Wii game involving taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck Beautiful a gold star for AJ mix who made that edit You know Someone else emailed something that I'm actually not going to To really talk much about because I can't watch it while we're live, but someone sent me an engineer's guide to cats Just the thought of that could be morbid I think I'm just going well especially since Dan was showing Julie that South Park episode last night about sniffing cat butts and so That just sort of makes me think of that. I'll watch it later, but thank you whoever sent me an engineer's guide to cats And that's it all right If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange lounge radio.com is the place to go Speaking of pen and paper the game Loki Yes, speaking of pen and paper the game now The game that we're referring to of course is lol never party alone. It's a multiplayer only game Put out by age tech. It's actually kind of like Pictionary sort of you basically draw that will give you like I guess a theme or a statement or something like draw a funny clown, and then you have to draw a clown or something like that and You know everybody draws it then one person votes on so it's like I guess Pictionary meets apples apples, and then the winner gets a point But the thing is as we said pen and paper of the game you can do this on pen and paper already You don't need the buy game. Well unfortunately you won't be able to buy this game in stores because according to The game's distributor age tech it will be available online only so Yeah, you won't find this in stores That's all right buy a tablet of paper and pens instead Oh just what is it surprising if what if you're playing it in a store? Then it will be in a store You can't buy it in a store though What if you were downloading it while you're in the store and paying the money while you're in that store? No, it's not downloadable. It's just that you're buying you have to buy it from their online store What if you're in there? Oh, what if you have your laptop, and you're at a store, okay? I'm picky Just forget it. Do you really need this game? I mean, it's not like what else did they sell online only electroplankton? Yeah, I like electroplankton. I know but exactly that was a game. That was worth buying online Lol, I don't know. I don't know about that one. You know you know what the the alternative to Lol is hmm. It's No open canvas picto chat Well guys We're going to get into another segment. We do here on orange launch radio once in a while and I kind of gave away what's coming earlier based on the music, but That's right when you hear that happy music. You know something really fucked up happened And it's probably time to give out another olr stupid award this time 18 year old Jean-Pierre, Orla, Orla wiz Orla wick wiz Orla wick is ol or le w icz or le was wiz I don't even know how to say that he is on trial right now for first degree premeditated murder Guess what him and his friend did they sound so happy they ambushed 26 year old Daniel Sorensen in November they stabbed him in the back and then sawed off his head and burned his body This was not a video game. This is real life. It is not funny when it happens in real life It's not as offensive as two guys kissing though Don't even Oh my god this guy looks psychotic I know seriously okay, so the trial is going on right now, but here it is. Here's what happened the defense is Blaming hitman that's right hitman Here it is from a cnn report quote They dealt with it a video game called hitman that he used to watch and it was a video game where you got Impressions that you would kill somebody hit them from their backside where they were not aware. They were being killed But I don't know that sounds a little more like manhunt to me but Regardless this guy's an idiot Not just for what he did I mean that was stupid anyway But for the fact that the defense and I guess the defense team wins the stupid award too But trying to blame it on hitman I mean come on I Mean get it's one thing to stab somebody and kill them that way, but like I That's insane like they like on a scale of one to ten one being like not really fucked up and ten being like super fucked Up like stabbing someone and killing them is at least twelve okay That's beyond fucked up, but stabbing them then cutting off their head then burning their body That's like 11 D billion on that scale okay so you've got issues, and you need to go away for a long time where we won't see you ever ever again and Don't try to blame it on a video game ass Stories like this make me angsty Oh, you know what happens usually after the stupid award comes about of angst and we like to call that here our f-use of the week Chuck soccer once you start us off tonight with the f-use of the week Okay, my f-u of the week goes towards people who drive really really slow like grandma slow When you're going the speed limit and they're going less than the speed limit And I know I talk about bad drivers all the time, but oh my god all of them were in front of me today And also an f-u goes towards the amounts of cleaning I've done in the past week in our house But I did get something really awesome. I have a toy. I call it the doctor's cleaning tool. It's called a sonic scrubber Nice and you use it for cars, and I used it for the bathroom instead, but anyway Just all the dust that got kicked up from all the cleaning I've done for Dan's pinball gathering tonight Has had my eyes bloodshot like all week, so f-u to dust too Loki do you have any f-u's of the week? F-u goes to this chair that I'm sitting on because it's horribly uncomfortable We will try to find a cheap chair for you at IKEA or something I promise IKEA has comfy plastic ones I want to get another chair like that. That chair is awesome the one you sit in I know they can't see it on just TV because you're secretive, but it's a very nice chair Sorry, look is that it? That's it. I got nothing else F-u to my pancreas which continues to bother me. I've been having chest pains today Although thankfully I've been getting a little bit better and speaking of food. I actually ate a full meal last night It was very nice I went to Mimi's and they have a low fat menu and they have a spaghetti marinara dish It was actually pretty damn good for low-fat, but I'm so sick of this low-fat diet I mean granted it's nice to have lost 25 pounds and all but I am so Sick of eating low-fat like seriously when Loki brought in that pizza tonight I'm like I would kill you for a slice of pizza Rob. What? I was going to let you know that I actually do have a good number of Low fat and low sugar recipes. Oh cool from my phase of South Beach that I would be more than happy to share with you So you can enjoy some of the food that you're missing good time So, you know what I'm craving right now though is like I I don't think it's low-fat though I want like a teriyaki rice bowl or something I guess just depends on who makes it and how they make it but oh that sounds so good right now All right Anyhow enough about food because I'm getting hungry because I haven't eaten dinner yet that will conclude the F use of the week and we'll Get back into the show with some more gaming news well, we've already known that the You know US and North America. We're gonna be getting a I guess limited-edition Metal Gear Solid bundle with the game, of course an 80 gig system and Also, I guess, you know the DualShock 3 controller well now there's also another bundle coming that's gonna be the Gunmetal gray PlayStation 3. In fact, it was confirmed by Konami's Brandon Loreno on the official PlayStation blog that this very very limited-edition system will be available in the North America as Part of a special Metal Gear Solid 4 bundle. So I guess it's the same thing, but this one's Gunmetal You know silver grayish and So I guess both these are gonna be scheduled to arrive around the game's release date of June 12th But I good luck getting your Gunmetal gray they're gonna be super rare basically, yeah super rare I bet I bet I know something that's even more rare and I know I can say something about this now because Bobby said it On his show tonight. I can talk about this a little bit All games radio which you know, we're a part of is going to be giving away This is super duper rare an Xbox 360 Grand Theft Auto 4 Box, okay. There's only like 500 of these puppies in existence all games got one and they're giving it away and Base and they're not giving it to you Loki. I'm sorry to say you're ineligible stupid rock star. Listen, okay I played more of Grand Theft Auto PSP multiplayer and trust me that's pretty painful Okay, that game had some pretty bad multiplayer but I loved it and we played it more than anybody any human on the face of this earth and Yet, you know, no love for me. What the hell? Well, here's the way it works on all games radio every show that's on the network gets to pick a finalist Basically, it gets to do a contest to pick a finalist So we'll be picking our finalist either next week or the week after but if you don't win with us You might be able to win with Bobby black wolf. You might be able to win all games interactive video game outsiders Platform nation, you know one of the you know countless other shows that all games radio has Everybody is gonna every show is gonna send one finalist to a last round and I don't know what they're gonna do at that point When the freaking mark echo, I mean, come on, man. They're just like throwing them away now. So stay tuned next week We'll have more details. We may even do the qualifier next week. I'll post more on the website I just I have to know the all games timetable either be next week or in two weeks. So we'll see Okay back to the news. Yes news because ferrets are always relevant to to my interests a something else is relevant to my interest is the BBC and the we and they rhyme because the BBC on we is cool we anyway, so There is a an I player replay service that the BBC has that's going to be functional on the Wii and the service is one that It's actually already available on iPod touch and iPhone that will do You limited by time different replays of BBC shows including Doctor Who torch wood Which are two of my favorites and whatever else they want. So, uh, it's actually It's for we owners in the UK. I actually want to try this on my on my iPhone. I would love to try it But if anyone wants to actually see what's what's playing on there. The address is BBC co dot UK Slash I player and you can see what they've got up for now. That's pretty sweet I was reading this concept a little bit earlier for the show start I'm like this is this is a great next step for the Wii I mean talking about wanting to be like, you know a centerpiece in the living room with its news and forecasting We talk about being able to bring television shows like that I mean even more so the next like what if you didn't have to pay for it? Well, I mean one thing though that I do want to mention that might be a A problem is that the BBC's website does IP check For example when the Sarah Jane adventures were just coming out. You actually couldn't even look at their website. It would block it completely and About I even use two different IP directors and it still had me blocked so but just for what's on there right now as far as featured items is Actually the last episode of Doctor Who that aired the other day Which was called Pompeii the last day There's also Not dodi open house to buy or not to buy Freaky Eaters Dateline London. Yeah, if you care There's some pretty good stuff on there love soup. I I would watch a lot of BBC shows I hope I kind of secretly hope they'd bring it over here and a show little Britain a show that my husband likes is Top Gear He watches episodes of that on YouTube Um, but Top Gear is also available to that. It's if you're a big, you know racing or car fanatic. That's a good show All right, well, we'll see well this is kind of interesting it's been How now maybe leaked out on? When Animal Crossing for the Wii will be coming out apparently Apparently there is a calendar available for the club Nintendo Folks, and of course, you know for April they have well, I should say they have different games for each month The backgrounds and stuff. So for April, of course, they have Mario Kart Wii Well guess what games in December, of course Animal Crossing They have a bunch of picture of the characters and that that could just be a huge coincidence Could be but I mean no last game that came out was on the DS and that was around November December ish so You know, it could be just a coincidence as come out. I'd be interested to see what's on the other months You know just to see if that that's that's the thing Yes, the thing was kind of missing like what are what's in the other months were some of the earlier games from this year in The earlier months like did you have you know? Smash Brothers brawl for March February, you know, like professor Layton or something for February and it is a bit of a stretch, but we'll see well We are about to wind down here and we'll be taking Skype calls very soon If you want to give us a call one eight seven seven game Olr or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio Keep in mind that is different from the other all games shows for those of you guys that are new to our show tonight Thanks to our new relationship with all games calm keep in mind We do have a different phone number than the rest of our shows that are live. Sorry. That's right or interrupt real quick They actually have someone actually has the calendar and it sounds like it may just be a coincidence because January was Mario Galaxy February was we fit but this is all stuff. That's Japanese dates. So, I don't know March was Mario Party They had April's Mario Kart may looks like they had like Yoshi's Island June something Metroid Prime related like Kirby Just all their stuff. Yeah, it's just it sounds like it's just random All right. Well, this isn't so random. This is very scientific and statistical. It's next generation published a report this week It's the top 100 selling video games of the last two months to 12 I'm sorry last 12 months not two months last 12 months compiled both across North America and Europe Okay, and I promised Jamie some cooking mama Did you know that cooking mama cook-off is the 98th top selling game in the past 12 months? Four hundred and seventy K units moved between North America and Europe pretty cool That's that's a lot even though the game was kind of crap compared to the DS Like it lost a lot of magic on its way to the Wii Kind of interesting to lend me yours. You can take it anytime. I'm not I'm not that excited about it I'm just quickly looking through the list to see if there's anything else notable on it I noticed boogie is in at number 87 and I don't know how I felt about boogie. It was a little bit corny But it's a lot of people. I I know that are casual gamers really like that game, so Let's see I'll try to wind it down here and just get to some of the top games that sold in the past 12 months What do you think what would your guesses be? What would you say was the number one selling game in the past 12 months just speculating because I know you haven't seen this story yet Halo 3 good good choice evil 3 mario Galaxy Okay, here's the top 10 number 10 was brain age 2 4 million units remember This is North America and Europe combined for whatever reason doesn't count Japan though number 9 was Super Mario Galaxy 4.1 million units 8 was Assassin's Creed 4.9 7 was Pokemon Diamond and Pearl with 5 million 6 was need for speed pro street 5.4 million 5 was Madden NFL oh 8 5.7 million 4 was FIFA Soccer oh 8 because remember we brought Europe into the mix so you know a soccer game is going to sell 5.7 million as well number 3 this surprised me guitar hero 3 was the number 3 selling game of the past 12 months me I Was just because it's so much more expensive 7.5 million units that doesn't surprise me, but I guess you consider all the systems this game is on Number 2 Halo 3 8 million units. I was close yeah close So you guys are both close the number one game though call of duty for modern warfare 8.3 million units yeah when you hear it, and then you think oh, yeah like seriously. I look at my friends list There's always someone playing call of duty for always played the hell out of that game Yeah, it's it's weird though because you know here on orange launch radio. That's not the type of game We usually talk about it's not the type of thing we play, but I even said that I liked it Yeah, we saw respect for it certainly weird imagine fashion designers number 66. Oh my God You know what games not on this list imagine babies know what I have judgment. I have just not on the list that is correct Good job. Loki. I did so notice some ps3 titles in there like I saw ratchet and clank in there somewhere so Well there you have it one more story then we're going to open up that skype line And I don't know how it's going to run tonight It might be kind of choppy because we have both justin TV and this higher bitrate streaming I will have to can justin TV during this segment if we have problems just you know we got one more story And it's a sweet one right Jamie. Yeah, it's really sweet and sappy makes my teeth hurt, but it's really cool There is a guy and let me make sure that I pronounced his name correctly Brian Clema. I guess Clema kale I am a who by his own account made a custom level in Super Smash Brothers Brawl this says Marry me and put the timer to infinite put peach Mario and Kirby who is his intended fiancee's favorite character and just left the TV on so when she came home and turned on the TV she's like oh, you're in the middle of the game, and then she saw that he had the ring in hand and Look, he said look at TV again. She said yes, so I thought it was sweet. Oh That's cute, and she proceeded to own him in Smash Bros. Brawl I don't see how anyone can play on the Marry me level though It'd be really freaking difficult to actually get out of the top part and land somewhere You can beat somebody else up You should put that level up for download for all the other nerds who want to do something like that That's the Marry me level up. I'll tell you what though the best engagement story I ever heard was dark soccer is that was my favorite tell the all-games crowd Your engagement over a particular movie. I love this story Dan and I We well we had known each other. You know online for quite a while and when I moved out here we on Valentine's day we were watching UHF. We were you know kind of broke. I didn't have a job and he was working telemarketing somewhere, but we were watching UHF and eating French baguettes and Spinach dip and drinking that the kosher blackberry wine. I love how you remember every detail. It's so girly, but cute Oh, shut up. I remember lots of details about lots of stuff and We just sort of mutually decided to get married it was like we should get married okay when sometime okay, I Just think the fact you got married over UHF is so funny. We're now brought us together. It's time to drink from the firehose Yeah Marvel in the oatmeal you should have had that at your wedding the firehose we didn't actually have a Wedding yeah, but at your you know you should have at least you know outside the courthouse Black corset and a purple skirt and boots When I got married it's awesome And then I had cake and it was good and then and then we went home, and I slept in the next day Okay Romantic odd one in chat says God if I had a nickel for every time I got laid because of UHF and DJ Morpheus you'd owe money. Yeah DJ Morpheus follows up with a zinger you'd owe five bucks What's that old saying great minds think like me no Dan says it great minds think like us all right Skyplines open one eight seven seven game. Oh LR again. I apologize a little bit experimental We'll see how this first call works out. Hi. You're on orange lounge radio. Who's this? Hello GS 68 what is on your mind my friend Um I have a question for a low low key about my currently all right. What's up? Logie or what's up GS 68 for Loki? Um have you played online yet? Yes? Um how's the online like if someone disconnects will they will they get replaced by CPU without you knowing like in Brawl? I don't think anyone disconnected in the ones that I played, but like you can choose you know between matches or whatever To leave or continue on to another race or something like that It's just sometimes a little difficult to get connected And it's kind of cool that once you're like if you're waiting in queue to you know join up the next game You actually watch the other people playing their games, so you can kind of switch between different cart views and stuff like that But I didn't actually see anyone get disconnected off there, so I don't know I'd assume they they would lose points Because the way the rankings work you start off with 5,000 points when you first start playing and then depending on where you place um within the 12 you'll lose up to like 64 points and then gain maybe 64 points, so I'd imagine if if they disconnected whatever No, sorry go ahead I'm Carroms saying that they can't hear me. I have to mic turn all the way up you were a little quiet But that's okay. It might be on our end. Just keep talking don't listen. Don't let them bully you in chat. Oh oh Anyways, that's what turns me off from playing Super Smash Bros. Online in the with anyone mode cuz if The game will disconnect you a game will please disconnect with a CPU and not tell you what's the point of playing online anymore? I mean, I'm gonna just play against three CPU characters honestly gs68 there really wasn't one And I think they just put it in as an afterthought to say they did it That's my honest answer because it sounds like Mario Kart we has a much more robust type of online like I didn't even know it Had that whole like ranking it has leaderboards I have like a bunch of stuff and you can look at your friends and see where they are like you know the different times And stuff you can download the top you know Rankers their ghost data and race it if you want to But not all that stuff works too. Well right now because of you know they're getting hammered So like trying to download ghost data didn't work for me. I I tried a few times, and it didn't work in fact I had to hammer online and finally get into a game It took me about 10 tries, and I finally got to play an online game, but well you know that'll get fixed eventually I'm sure but right now. It's just you know getting hammered pretty bad All right any other comments gs68 or questions oh? Yeah, I'm you didn't nominate any games for all our March Madness right you know we send in our lists later We we got in there late, so we weren't in on the nomination process for all our March Madness and just for the benefit because Folks who only listen to us in the podcast may not know and all games folks may not know DMN one of our other personalities from the old orange launch radio station kind of was rounding up this March Madness Competition but involving video games. I'll be honest. It's very similar to the type of thing You've probably seen on game facts in the past, but it wasn't with characters It was with games And he was trying to find the best game of all time of which super Metroid ended up winning last week For which I got called every name in the book because I it was separated by one vote Yes, even amongst all the chatters all the hosts in studio of which we had quite a few guests last week It was separated by one vote and I cast the deciding vote to make super Metroid win over Chrono Trigger And I took a lot of shit for it But yeah, we did not actually send in the qualifier list because DMN closed it off early But what would you want to ask about that? Yeah? Yeah, what I would like ask him like our listeners like what games they wish she had nominated but I mean that's What I mean some games that are very big like we're on the brackets and So basically like I see that the kind of thing like you know what was missing What should have been there? What what wasn't on the brackets that should have been? I think honestly you'd I? Think the sampling was a pretty good sampling of like you know the Mainstream best games that there were out there. I think honestly you would be diving into everyone's niche gaming To see what it is they missed you know if you're an RPG fan you probably said oh Where was grandia or where was you know some some niche RPG if you're a racing game fan? You were probably like oh, where was you know? Burnout or whatever it is so well I mean I surprised to see that like obscure games like massive to the allegiance are the brackets yet I gave like Castlevania simply that which is what which did so much pretty Castlevania series it what it basically took To the action They can buy 2d action adventure gameplay RPG elements like that game was not on there Yeah, Castlevania is one of my favorite games, too You know if I'd nominated it would have been definitely in my top five But I got to finish this up because we can move on to other calls But I will say this we might try it again in a few months Let the dust settle a little bit Maybe when there's another thing going on now that we have the additional resources of all games comm maybe we can do something a little More epic and maybe a little more inclusive of everybody's tastes so, but we'll see it's gonna be interesting though Cuz when you throw like if we were to do something all-encompassing of all games You know you take a show like all games interactive and a lot of those folks are really into the sports titles and the call Of duties and the things we don't give enough time to on this show So I think it would be very interesting to bring those two worlds together and see what still comes out on top We'll see what happens gs68 we got to let you go so we can get some more calls him But thanks so much for the phone call buddy. All right. Take care. All right all right We're gonna take some more calls one eight seven seven game Olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio, but looky looky. We got a call. Hi.

It was Surprised you guys didn't do it soon enough it did slide through 65. You know probably like a year. You know you're earlier I mean yeah hindsight is always 20 20 isn't it look you got a question. What's on your mind? Basically all right since I managed to get a PSP last Friday and managed to get a hat I need some good. You know some good apps. Okay. I mean you I Know you got to help me out with a little bit of something, but why else can I put on my PSP? Turn the homebrew What now I'm sorry I? Can't I couldn't understand him Um I just heard I just turned down the bandwidth on Justin TV So hopefully we'll get a little better. He wants to know like PSP apps. He should have I don't know I haven't downloaded anything in a long time. I guess emulators. I mean that's kind of cool, but uh you know PSP radio, maybe I Don't know Really downloaded a number I Know Zaku you should get the you you should get the PSP radio thing in the latest firmware And you can listen to all games radio now on the PSP radio anywhere you go You got you got the latest firmware hacks already got that one actually Zaku you reminded me of something and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but did you see this? Loki I'm curious if you saw this Sony sent out a poll earlier this week basically asking people. Why do you hack the PSP? Yes, I kind of try. Why do you hack? The basically they sent out a poll saying like you know and it asked people to rate things on a scale like one to seven Going like you know yes, I agree or no I don't agree You know like I hack my PSP because I like the challenge or I hack my PSP to give it features of the PSP I have my PSP to steal games kind of interesting I Hack it just to spite you How about how about a couple good websites? Zaku can keep an eye on because really it's about what you want to do with the PSP so had a couple good websites for I guess psphacks.com pspupdates.qj.net Stuff like that I mean those would be two websites I'd check they have a lot of downloads on there and stuff right I just barely had trouble today. Just getting some proper emulators. You know But you know at least I know people you know like you Loki and other folks that can you know help me out That's good. You gotta get back on that scene. I mean three latest M33 is pretty damn good right now Especially when your PSP is overclocked Alright Zaku we got to let you go so we can get more calls any quick final thoughts I'm gonna get your PSP hacked. Don't leave you. You know fuck Sony's Endurance all right. Just know somebody went up in door, but battery. That's all you need to know all right It's all about the battery take care, buddy 1 8 7 7 game olr. I'm hoping our next call will be a little better with the bandwidth because I dropped Justin TV a lot In the video they're probably just seeing a still picture in there right now. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hi guys, this is footy monster. See that's a lot quicker It was like no and the footy monsters in Argentina, so we might just have to do that every week on just TV anyway Sorry, we're learning about our show live. What's on your mind footy monster noise at all I just want to share a couple of things for a quick first off congrats on your new home. Thank you We like it. Hey quick dark Sakura put some of the nice silverware here from all games in your purse Okay All right, sorry, what's up? Well, you know that story you had earlier about Brazil and the whole bully thing Yes, I do well Here's the thing as far as understand since it's pretty close from here The only country that I know that's in South America that has any sort of official distribution of anything is actually Chile And they have Microsoft like Sony doesn't release anything officially and Nintendo doesn't release anything officially Argentina used to have official distribution of Nintendo products, but those that was like in 1995 So I'm thinking and and this is just a theory that you know anything that happens in Brazil Rockstar will never care for because it's not that they were sending their game to Brazil Because they are not doing it. It's just you know retailers importing the game and having a great market so to speak um You know what's interesting though is that it's interesting in Nintendo doesn't support South America more because like I was just kind of noticing I was just looking at some of the box art on a recent game drew was here last week And he gave me back super paper Mario because he borrowed it and I was just kind of eyeing the back of the box And kind of noticing how like it's interesting on Nintendo Puts the back of their boxes in three different languages all at once now like you look at the back of a box of a Nintendo game it's in English French and Spanish all in the back, but you read some of the fine print yes I was very bored it talks about how the game is only for distribution in the United States Canada hence the French and Latin America they say hence the span of Latin America is like Puerto Rico Which is basically the u.s.. And Mexico is basically the u.s.. Which well I think some of our Mexican listeners might disagree, but but Yeah, but at the same time the distribution of products I do find it interesting because then they're basically saying well Latin America is just Mexico It is kind of interesting that they are cutting off the rest of the countries south of Mexico Well, no not really. I mean considering the economies that we have here. It's not that surprising I mean who's over here what you have to spend to play a game? I mean I was just the other day at the shop buying a 360 game well attempting to and it was like 90 US dollars So I'm not gonna go buy a game for that price, so if Nintendo had to officially release their games support the region We think the prices of games are gonna be You know and they I mean they're not gonna sell at what people here could buy because they will have no profit and even worse You know people from the US would import from South America, and it's the same thing right and pay cheaper true It would never work. I guess that's true. I Guess we had to get the realist perspective so in the mean in the meantime How are you getting your games footy remind our listeners? How do you get your games? Do you just have to pay the mark up or do you import or what actually I got a 360 quite recently I? Probably January, and I had the option of flashing the bias and just you know like lucky Look at us in one of his 360s and part of my games But I actually really like the live experience, and I actually bit the bullet then whenever I go to Chile games They're a pretty and another cheap, but they're competitive prices with the u.s.. I seen I could buy Mass Effect with 50 bucks Or the other day I found lost Odyssey for 45 bucks Oh nice, so you know it's like the prices are even sometimes They're even cheaper like a god deal a for new seal for 20 bucks, so What I could what I did is just actually go there because I have family there and whenever I make a trip I just bring two or three games with me. You know because here. It's like $100, but over there It's since Microsoft official distributes the games. It's totally you know possible to actually buy original games so right now I'm buying original games and just doing it on ps2. I had to back. You know buy backups That's all you could do and on my DS. It's I do the same thing It's very interesting footy to hear you kind of talking openly about Pirating games which you know has ruffled some feathers in the past here on this show with some of our listeners who are against pirating Which you know I understand Let me let me make this straight It's interest, but it's interesting though footy when it's your only option You know like you're talking about I mean It's that or smuggle your games from Chile or not play games because really I mean just because you don't have money Your option is not stealing. You know I do because I am fully aware that I'm doing something That's not entirely legal or morally you know correct, but I have that better I will this is a small anecdote here when I was a kid I used to go to a computer shop to get my computer games in floppy disks And I would go my floppy disk that I would buy in a box at a retailer Go there, and you know look at through a list of games and ask them for a game And they would I would pay them and I would go home to me that was totally normal and reasonable That was how you got games right only later. I understood that that's illegal, but that was the way you did it here Hmm, so there's another culture of original games here there. I mean really there isn't So that's part of the problem as well piracy is just so rampant you know that it's like the way it is It's like go to China and say you know with the same argument. It will not work I guess it's so interesting to hear from around the world kind of the way things work because sometimes We're in our little bubbles in these other countries We live in so what I love about the internet and doing these podcasts and talking to people from around the world as you get To hear you to hear from gamers everywhere footy We got to wrap up and let you go, but anything else you want to say to our listeners That's pretty much it guys. I guess I'll talk to you later. All right. Good luck footy. Take care YouTube Smuggles his games from Chile amazing Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? This is the excuse next to be a second time and hopefully more stable way Then you sound millions light-years better hello, Tony. I know you sound telephony probably cuz he's on the telephone He's on the 877, but that's all right. Yeah, what's on you? I blame Skype. I blame Vista. I blame I calm crap and you know everything else I can blame. It's not my life is five. Don't forget to blame them. Oh Yeah, sure by 365 screw the RA the older fault. All right, and the police. All right Jason what's on your mind? Two short things and one quick thing And one longer thing. Did you know that they made an impossible mission remake on the Wii? Yes in Europe. Where is it here? I want it. Gimme gimme gimme On my video game shelf come over and play it sometime. Shut up. Did you import it from Europe? No, it was in the we went to Best Buy we were checking out and it was just sitting in those discount bins What I looked at it I laughed it said I'm getting this and bid and I've already played it then the game must come out here under the radar. I Yeah, it doesn't have any it's obviously not all it works on our TV without anything special, you know You use freeloader any of that stuff, right? Well shit, I'm gonna go get but I'm gonna go pick that up tomorrow then. All right, cool Thanks for the heads up. Hold up. Well, I didn't even know it came out here. That's great It's cuz it didn't it did it did not it only came out in the DS Yeah possible mission DS 10 bucks on Amazon. All right. Well, we'll see I'm gonna have to pick it just cuz I'm sure It plays like crack at the box. I'll look for more logos. I will take a picture and show you guys I it's not that I don't believe you. Oh here. Here's the best way to tell Here's the best way to tell Jason see if it has a rating an ESRB rating on it because if it doesn't oh, yeah Then it's different overseas. Aha. That's the way to tell. So anyway, what was the other? What was the other story with little or what was the other story right now? But the I'd barely they're watching Mulan Roo, so it's kind of noisy out there and I want to make too much of a ruckus No, what are they singing? What are they singing along? No But I heard them laughing uncontrollably just a minute ago. So good enough. I guess Oh girls All right. Oh, yes, of course I completely forgot what the second thing is. So I'll just skip to the last thing. All right farms is exceedingly intelligent Yes, he is. I Was obviously listening to the interview since I made it back in time to be able to listen to the show And the discussion along the lines of XNA and we wear and everything opening up new opportunities. It's Opening up another avenue for developers of the sort to showcase their talent, but it's not going to be a It's going to be the same thing with indie and underground games. We already have through a different medium It's you know, so the ones that are really good There will be that one game and then the talent from the studio or just a or just a specific individuals can be hired Onto a big-name studio and the cycles going to continue It's a it's a great new app a new absolutely But it's not going to fundamentally change the landscape of indie games being easily accessible and open to everybody and it was just very Interesting to hear somebody else. I mean go figure developer especially was it's very interesting to hear him say the exact same thoughts That I would have on such a thing. It's a great thing, but it doesn't change the landscape, but and Plus the fact that you know, he's in another country too. So you kind of get you know, that whole thing I was just talking about with footy monster hearing from gamers around the world hearing It's still the same idea over there. Not that there's you know, obviously all the all the companies are in Australia doing business It's it's not that radically different from what it is over here in Europe or what have you but still still interesting that it all Comes to that kind of same thought. I I don't know Maybe I blew the XNA thing out of proportion a little bit when we first heard it about it on the show But I still think it's going to be a pretty radical, you know, it's just like YouTube didn't change the internet Completely, but it had a great impact that was felt you know what I mean and live people know what YouTube is and where I Honestly think XNA is going to be a YouTube of sorts for gaming. That's kind of how I feel Did you play those little community XNA what two-week trial games that they had up there? Yeah, some of them were fun Yes, yes that they were it's I don't know that it's gonna have the same I completely understand your comparison but I don't think it's gonna have the same impact as YouTube just because Gamers the the XNA toolkit as I've talked to Bobby about the past and other various things Apparently the XNA toolkit is exceedingly interesting, but it doesn't lower the bar YouTube lowered the bar You take a video clicking the buttons and you're done. I guess that's true. This is Yeah, this is very special and it is a great Avenue, but it's not gonna fundamentally change everything So, okay I you know I am comparing apples to oranges a little bit but I still kind of think that whole concept where it's gonna be a lot Easier for the people that can do it to get their stuff out there because you know You look at some of those little trial games that came out, you know games like the dishwasher Jelly car were yards better than Yaris. You know what I mean? They were a while ago It's the loop and some of the other, you know, there's been some other junk on expo I hate to say it but the Tron ports weren't all that great like they could have done better and some of the other classic Game ports, you know what I mean? Yeah, I just think you know put it put these new game developers me interesting these new games can certainly hold a candle to classic remakes and Shit like yours. Yeah Jason we got a wrap up here so we can sign off for the night. It's already midnight 30 on the East Coast Do you have any quick final thoughts for us? I Wish I knew with all I wanted to say, but I forgot so good night. Well, you can always call us next week Good night. Absolutely. Bye Our fearless webmaster VX Jason XV. We love him here on the program. That's gonna do it for the skype line tonight Sorry to those didn't get through we can always try again next week We're gonna wrap up the show. But first we got to get some last-minute news I'm gonna check in with Loki and see if there's any last-minute news Not really much but it's kind of interesting it looks like There's a hacking group blaze team that has released a hacked We virtual console game that they've broken the encryption on so that's a whole Big old can of worms that Nintendo probably doesn't want opened and Then there's some other interesting things castle Crashers, it looks like it's gonna have some new characters including a bear that fights with a fish and You also I guess get little I don't know helper pets or something like that. They have a floating cat It's kind of funny. I can't wait for this game to come out a A floating cap. Yeah, it's an animal orb. It says the cat who will add to your agility and strength Interesting I Don't know. It's it's cute Rosteel UT says the ESRB org lists impossible mission for DS PS 2 PSP and we I gotta go look for that They have yeah scratch paws the cat which is a cute name for a cat scratch paw. I'll let a cute they also have There are some other pictures in here. They have like a little bird and a dog and I Don't know. It's just it's just all on a dev blog dot the behemoth calm And you can check out like they show off the different weapons and stuff Was it the barbarian axe fish? They have a thin sword skinny sword thick sword pumpkin peeler And the different characters for castle crashers looks like well the bear and then periwinkle night and You know other than and they're gonna have a lot of characters to play as that games gonna be fucking awesome can't wait That's really it I think didn't we talked about games for Windows magazines going online only yeah I think so, but yeah, it is it's kind of the way magazines are going right now anyway. Yeah, I had to say All right, we're gonna wrap up. We're running pretty long tonight on our first all-game show, but that's all right We had a good time. We had farms on the show.
