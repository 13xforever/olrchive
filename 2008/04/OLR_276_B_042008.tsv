15000	19500	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19500	25500	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening, April 20th, 2008,
25500	29500	with episode number 276 of our show.
29500	33000	We are live on allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 p.m. Pacific,
33000	36000	immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show.
36000	39000	So, come join us for live taping if you've never been here before.
39000	43000	I do know we have some new faces in our chat, so thanks so much to all you guys in chat.
43000	46500	I think as we are making our presence more known on allgames.com,
46500	49500	and people are realizing they don't have to register anymore to listen,
49500	54000	and it's really, really easy to get into our show just by going to allgames.com in your browser.
54000	57500	I think we're getting more and more, so thanks to all you guys who have tuned in
57500	59000	and helped made our show a success.
59000	61500	If you haven't listened to part A yet, why not?
61500	63500	You should go back in the archives and listen to part A.
63500	66500	We talked about Soul Caliber coming to Xbox Live Arcade,
66500	69500	and our dreams to have Guitar Caliber, you know,
69500	73000	follow up with what we had on Rod Caliber on the Dreamcast.
73000	75500	For those of you listening live, though, you already heard it,
75500	78500	and you've been sitting through music, right, waiting for us to get back to some gaming news.
78500	81000	So, let's get to it, Loki. How about some gaming news?
81000	91500	Yes. So, there are some rumors with the exclusive download content coming to Grand Theft Auto IV for the Xbox 360 version.
91500	97000	There's kind of a wonder, what the hell is the download content going to be?
97000	104500	Well, according to CVG's recent Grand Theft Auto IV Collector's Edition magazine,
104500	111000	the Xbox 360 download content could be whole new cities.
111000	116500	They were saying, of course, to call games as vastly ambitious as Vice City and San Andreas
116500	122000	mere expansion packs seems childish, but nevertheless, the downloadable content DLC
122000	130500	coming from the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto IV has repositioned those games in just this way.
130500	137000	Download content so far has meant the odd new car, jumper of a bit horse armor,
137000	142000	and then they said, but Grand Theft Auto IV is set to completely redefine the idea of
142000	149000	expansions with Grand Theft Auto IV, what Vice City or San Andreas were to Grand Theft Auto III.
149000	153000	Yes, Rockstar is clearly hinting at new downloadable cities,
153000	158000	and chances of them being London, Vice City, or San Andreas are slim to none.
158000	162000	So, that's new as brand new.
162000	168000	Grand Theft Auto IV's Liberty City is just the beginning. Think about that and get excited.
168000	173000	So, since this new Grand Theft Auto game is supposed to be a parody of New York City, right?
173000	176000	Are we going to get Upstate New York as the expansions?
176000	177000	Maybe, you know.
177000	180000	Or Jersey? Grand Theft Jersey?
180000	185500	I don't think they're going to just replace Vice City or something like that with downloadable content.
185500	187000	Grand Theft Auto Poughkeepsie?
187000	193000	I think we could see additions to the game, because obviously they can only fit so much on that disc.
193000	199000	So, I could see expansions to the current city, like outskirts type stuff,
199000	203000	but I don't know about like, you know, Grand Theft Auto London,
203000	207000	like you'd be able to fly to another city or something like that from the airport,
207000	208000	but that'd be pretty cool if you could.
208000	210000	I don't know. You never know.
210000	214000	Well, what about just being able to cross through the tunnel and you go into Grand Theft Auto Jersey,
214000	220000	and the Xbox comes with a new attachment that will make your entire house smell like New Jersey.
220000	221000	I hope not.
221000	224000	Kidding! I love Jersey. Love you guys.
224000	228000	Couldn't resist a cheap swipe, though.
228000	232000	And of course, everybody in chat is now just getting in on it saying,
232000	235000	Grand Theft Auto Newark, Grand Theft Auto Mount Vernon.
235000	240000	So, I don't know. What are your thoughts, Loki?
240000	243000	Do you think there's any possible legitimacy to this?
243000	249000	I don't think it's going to be as ambitious as, say, a brand new city,
249000	255000	but I think that they will add portions of the map or add new stuff as far as like...
255000	257000	Maybe new islands? Maybe little things?
257000	260000	Originally, they said it was going to be episodic content,
260000	263000	so I could see new missions or something like that for the game.
263000	266000	I don't know about whole new portions of the map.
266000	269000	That'd be kind of big.
269000	270000	Very ambitious.
270000	273000	And I don't know why they would...
273000	278000	I guess $50 million is a lot of money to convince them to make these things
278000	280000	exclusively for the Xbox 360 version.
280000	282000	You're right. $15 million is a lot of money.
282000	285000	And I would think also, if that were going to be the case,
285000	288000	if they were going to be getting full downloadable islands and stuff like that,
288000	289000	wouldn't Microsoft be going,
289000	292000	Hey, guess what? They're going to get full downloadable cities.
292000	293000	Buy our version.
293000	294000	Hey, wait a minute. I got it.
294000	297000	If Grand Theft Auto is getting downloadable islands from New York,
297000	300000	Grand Theft Auto, Fire Island.
300000	302000	Fire Island?
302000	304000	No.
304000	306000	I'll let you think about that one for a little while.
306000	311000	Meanwhile, this is all kinds of cool and actually kind of funny and ironic.
311000	314000	Remember when we were talking about how Orange Lawns Radio was coming to all games?
314000	316000	And by the way, I didn't mention this earlier in the show,
316000	319000	because I don't have details yet, but I will mention this now.
319000	323000	Travis Donovan Live, our buddy who was on Orange Lawns Radio
323000	325000	on Saturday nights on the old stream of this,
325000	327000	he is coming to all games. We know that much.
327000	331000	I don't know details yet, but we know he is making the move to all games.
331000	334000	And so collectively with us moving and Travis moving
334000	336000	and Bobby already being there and all the other shows,
336000	339000	and now there's a new show, there's the electric system.
339000	342000	Well, isn't Travis Donovan going to be doing something with DMN anyways?
342000	345000	Yeah, well, I think the new show is then partnered up,
345000	348000	but shh, I don't, shh, secret, I don't know the details yet.
348000	353000	Anyhow, we refer to it as the Voltron of podcasting, right?
353000	354000	The Voltron of gaming podcasting.
354000	357000	And ironically enough, what came to Xbox Live Marketplace this week?
357000	364000	Voltron. And Voltron has a free episode available on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
364000	366000	You kind of have to dig for it, but it's there.
366000	368000	There's a free episode of Voltron available.
368000	370000	I know you like free stuff, so go check that out.
370000	374000	Unfortunately, it's not in HD. It's in all its 80s SD glory.
374000	375000	But come on, it's Voltron.
375000	376000	It is Voltron.
376000	377000	And it's free.
377000	380000	Now, naturally, you could get the same damn thing,
380000	382000	probably just downloading it from BitTorrent.
382000	385000	But come on, why not support Voltron?
385000	387000	Support free.
387000	389000	I support free unless it's yours.
389000	392000	And you know, I think Microsoft did this on purpose, actually.
392000	395000	It's proof that Microsoft is indeed listening to everything.
395000	401000	Exactly, and that's exactly why they need to give me the Grand Theft Auto 4 Elite Console.
401000	403000	I don't know any nicer way to say this to you.
403000	406000	You're ineligible, and you're not going to ever be eligible.
406000	409000	And if you fucking try to enter this in a fake name or something,
409000	413000	you will be caught, and you will be made fun of.
413000	414000	I will not.
414000	419000	By the way, if you haven't heard, we're giving away an Xbox 360 Elite with the rest of all games.com.
419000	422000	Details are in part A. We'll give you more details next week.
422000	426000	Meanwhile, let's move on with the gaming news past Voltron.
426000	437000	It looks like that EA is going to be releasing Rock Band on PS3, PS2, and Wii in Europe for...
437000	440000	Wow, did that just shock you into dropping your water?
440000	443000	Yes, I was so shocked, I actually just dropped my water.
443000	444000	No, I'm just a klutz.
444000	447000	It'll be coming out on August 29th.
447000	452000	That means that basically Xbox 360 is going to go,
452000	456000	well, crap, we're not the only ones anymore over there.
456000	457000	Crap, crap, crap, crap.
457000	461000	No one will care because Saints Row 2 will come out around the same time,
461000	463000	and that game is far superior.
463000	468000	Actually, I will say this, do you realize, Loki, and this did shock me into dropping my water,
468000	471000	there are a couple people in chat who have just said this,
471000	475000	if I win the 360, I'll give it to Loki.
475000	478000	And I can't stop them from doing that.
478000	481000	I mean, if they win it and they decide they're going to give it to you as a Christmas present,
481000	487000	but I tell you what, you owe them the tingle outfit if they do that for you.
487000	489000	You fucking owe it to them to do the tingle outfit.
489000	490000	Bet be damned.
490000	495000	If one of these people wins the Xbox for you, you owe it to society to do the tingle outfit.
495000	496000	You wish.
496000	498000	I think that if they win...
498000	500000	I'm trying to give them around this roundabout way.
500000	504000	I deserve that system because I love Grand Theft Auto that much.
504000	506000	But do you love tingle that much?
506000	508000	I don't love tingle that much, and you know what?
508000	509000	They should give it to me.
509000	511000	They have 500 other systems.
511000	514000	Why the fuck are they being so stingy with them?
514000	517000	And Misty sums up my thoughts exactly in chat.
517000	520000	She says, fuck that. Give it to me.
520000	521000	That's what I was just sitting over here saying.
521000	523000	Give it to me if you're going to give it to somebody.
523000	525000	It has to go in the collection.
525000	527000	You don't play Grand Theft Auto.
527000	528000	I have.
528000	529000	You have.
529000	533000	She wants to suck it into her bored collective of gaming crap that is her house.
533000	537000	It has to become part of the vault.
537000	538000	And people are really...
538000	541000	People think I'm joking when I call it the vault, but no.
541000	542000	Dan calls it the vault.
542000	545000	Everybody calls it the vault.
545000	547000	We need that for the vault.
547000	549000	I did enter a contest.
549000	551000	I was going to talk about this a little later.
551000	553000	But you know with that...
553000	556000	Was it the Rockstar Social Club that they have now?
556000	558000	Their cool little tracking service and stuff.
558000	561000	The first contest that they have is you'll win...
561000	568000	Enter a chance to win a piece of artwork that's your likeness done in the Grand Theft Auto cover style.
568000	570000	That's kind of cool.
570000	574000	Of course, if I want that done, I could probably just do it myself.
574000	578000	See, this is the type of person that does not appreciate a Grand Theft Auto 4 elite system.
578000	580000	Alright, get past it, people. Get past it.
580000	583000	Alright, do we finish up with the Rock Band news?
583000	585000	I apologize, I got derailed by the...
585000	586000	Actually, there's one more bit about that.
586000	587000	What's that?
587000	589000	I just thought that it might be interesting that...
589000	596000	The ferret can't fucking win that system either, just for the record.
596000	598000	Neither can any of his family.
598000	605000	Which, by the way, I would like to know if there is still another ferret attached to a Katamari somewhere in Namco's headquarters.
605000	610000	You know what, I got a pretty sizable present for Amazon for my birthday.
610000	613000	I might order another ferret if they still own Amazon.
613000	614000	Lordy.
614000	617000	That's the last thing we need on OLRs for the ferrets to mate.
617000	619000	Please, back to gaming, Loki.
619000	620000	We need mini ferrets.
620000	621000	Save our show, Loki.
621000	622000	Many, many ferrets.
622000	624000	Unfortunately, you know, it was the KB Toys.
624000	626000	They had the KB Toy outlet.
626000	628000	Actually, the KB Toys weren't outlet enough.
628000	629000	That's where I got the last of the ferrets.
629000	631000	Unfortunately, they weren't anymore.
631000	638000	I actually had to cut them open to put new batteries in them because the geniuses that they are didn't make an opening for batteries.
638000	646000	Anyways, Splinter Cell, Chaos Theory, and Metal Arms are coming to Xbox Live Originals.
646000	651000	You can get both of those games available for 1200 Microsoft points.
651000	656000	They're going to be on there actually tomorrow or Monday.
656000	660000	And, yeah, that's pretty awesome.
660000	663000	They're going to be available everywhere except for Korea and Japan.
663000	668000	No Splinter Cell, Chaos Theory for Korea or Japan.
668000	672000	I'm sorry to derail the show again, but I have to.
672000	674000	Jamie, you have to check out the link I just posted in chat.
674000	678000	I typed Skoozie, which is the name of the little pet.
678000	683000	I typed it into Google, and the first thing that came up was a real ferret versus a Skoozie.
683000	687000	And there's some really cute pictures in here of the ferret cuddling up with the Skoozie.
687000	689000	So you have to check that out.
689000	692000	And then it looks like he's trying to eat it in one of those pictures.
692000	696000	I like that one because it looks like the ferret has the Skoozie on his head.
696000	699000	And it reminds me of the bunny with the pancake on its head.
699000	702000	Oh, I love it. It's so cute.
702000	705000	Rob, I want a ferret, okay?
705000	707000	And look at the little fangies on the ferret.
707000	711000	Oh, we have an update from Black Wolf about Loki's eligibility for the contest.
711000	716000	Here's the official word from Lord Bobby Black Wolf.
716000	718000	I think that's his official title over at AllGames.com.
718000	719000	He's Lord Bobby Black Wolf.
719000	727000	He says, maybe I'll let Loki enter the contest if he wears a tingle costume to the next two OLRs and sit on the cam the entire time, no hiding.
727000	730000	No! That is not acceptable.
730000	732000	You dare say no to Lord Bobby?
732000	738000	Do not belittle my Grand Theft Auto fanboyism, okay?
738000	744000	I know he's going to try and do it too. He's going to try to enter as somebody else or send it to his friend.
744000	751000	See, that's where you forget. I am more lazy than you will ever believe.
751000	755000	So, do I really have time to make something and send it in? No.
755000	759000	Alright, I'm sorry. Alright, look. Back to gaming news. We gotta get past this.
759000	765000	Mailbag is coming up as well if you have emails to send in. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
765000	770000	This is a cool sounding game in name alone. It's Afro Samurai.
770000	775000	You might notice an animated series that has Samuel L. Jackson doing some voices in it.
775000	780000	Xbox 360 and PS3 is getting a version of Afro Samurai this fall.
780000	785000	And the game will follow Afro as he is seeking revenge for the murder of his father.
785000	789000	And he is, quote, fighting to become the number one warrior.
789000	792000	The game will follow the storyline in the series.
792000	796000	And, you know, you just want to know if Samuel L. Jackson is going to be doing the dialogue.
796000	802000	He is. So there you have it. The musical score will also be done by RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan.
802000	803000	Sweet.
803000	808000	So it sounds pretty authentic. If you're a fan of the show, you will probably be a fan of the game Afro Samurai.
808000	811000	But if you hate it, then, well, you probably won't want it.
811000	818000	There was actually an art book for it at Kinokuniya yesterday when I was there.
818000	822000	Cool. Do they have a Japanese version?
822000	827000	I don't know. But I saw an art book. So it's kind of cool.
827000	828000	Pretty cool.
828000	833000	All right. Well, it's time for that part of the show where you guys get to interact with us, not just through the chat room.
833000	836000	We also have our Skype line. We just have many different ways you can interact with the show.
836000	844000	Because, you know, OLR is all about giving every gamer a voice. And many voices coming into our mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
844000	849000	Dark Soccer is going to reach into the mailbag and pull out a favorite email of hers and read it right now.
849000	851000	Or two or five.
851000	853000	We have actually a few.
853000	856000	First email, dun dun dun, from Geronimo.
856000	858000	It says, hello, OLR.
858000	865000	While I wasn't surprised with the story the other week about one kid shooting his friend over not getting his turn while playing a video game, I did realize this.
865000	870000	The media says that video games promote violence and it really seems like they only promote gun violence.
870000	873000	Or the media only covers gun violence.
873000	878000	Has anyone been, has there ever been a story about one person beating another person to death after playing Tekken?
878000	880000	I don't think so.
880000	886000	Has anybody tried to use the Kalamitic symphony on their friend when they lose in Soul Calibur?
886000	889000	No. But kudos to anyone who can do that in the real world.
889000	893000	Has anyone been beat over the head with a shovel after playing Viva Pinata?
893000	894000	Nuh uh.
894000	901000	So do you think that when people say games promote violence, do you think that they should say that they promote gun violence instead?
901000	909000	Because it seems like that is the only violent action people take and blame on games.
909000	914000	Or people should just stop blaming it singly on games and maybe consider it's the whole picture.
914000	919000	You know, when I say the whole picture, I mean all forms of movies and other types of entertainment.
919000	925000	Most importantly, when the parents aren't watching and not telling their kids what's right and wrong.
925000	927000	There's already freakin' problems with the kids.
927000	930000	You know, put them in the institution.
930000	932000	Since you don't want to do your damn job anyway.
932000	934000	Send them to boot camp. Call Maury.
934000	941000	Um, next email from GS68 says, hey Loki, hey Jamie, hey bla bla bla bla bla.
941000	943000	Um. Hi.
943000	946000	I come once again to bring up the issue of recent games being too easy.
946000	948000	Perhaps this is what gamers want.
948000	954000	I've noticed that, for example, the House of the Dead 2 and 3 return is not getting a lot of good reception because of its limited continues.
954000	959000	Compare this to Ghost Squad, which has unlimited continues, which I don't see anyone whining about.
959000	963000	In fact, many welcome it as it allows them to never die.
963000	969000	So games may be getting easier, yes, but is this a good thing to make games less frustrating so that more can enjoy them?
969000	974000	P.S. This email was brought to you by Olive Garden, a home of never-ending boots to the head.
974000	981000	I would be surprised if there wasn't some type of code or something that comes out later that's going to give that game the unlimited continues or what have you.
981000	983000	And actually, I kind of think that might be the way to do it.
983000	991000	Is maybe slowly, you know, a type of game, I think the best types of games are the ones that have a sort of accordion difficulty.
991000	994000	Where, you know, the better you are at it, the harder it gets.
994000	999000	But the more the game realizes you suck at it, the more it takes pity on you and lets you beat it eventually.
999000	1000000	You know what I mean?
1000000	1005000	So I'm hoping there's something maybe that will come out for that a little later for those folks that are whining.
1005000	1010000	It's too difficult because some people, some people just want to blast through it to say they blast through it.
1010000	1014000	But then, of course, I understand there's the hardcore gamers that want to say they did it and they were first too.
1014000	1016000	If that makes sense.
1016000	1019000	So next email then.
1019000	1021000	Sure.
1021000	1023000	This is Dear Orange Lounge Radio.
1023000	1025000	I have no gamertag or ID.
1025000	1027000	I mainly played handheld and the Wii.
1027000	1031000	I'm fortunate that I have a job where I am required to sit and wait for action.
1031000	1033000	So I get through my fair share of handheld games.
1033000	1036000	I'm a big fan of listening to you for over a year now.
1036000	1042000	And I am a tart of a listener listening to over a dozen gaming podcasts regularly.
1042000	1047000	I find it interesting to see how when a story appears on one side, it dissipates through the others.
1047000	1049000	Oops, that was an accident.
1049000	1051000	I didn't mean to hit the ferret.
1051000	1053000	I'm often smirky at your I wish statements.
1053000	1058000	I remember a few weeks back on one of your future wishes was a TV on your mobile.
1058000	1066000	Here in the UK, I have that for over 50 pence for a 24 hour period.
1066000	1070000	I can watch actual television or I can play monthly fee for less overall.
1070000	1073000	Covering the major terrestrial channels and MTV, etc.
1073000	1078000	Also, in this week's part A, number 275, you mentioned, why can't I have one?
1078000	1080000	Can I jump in real quick about the TV on the mobile thing?
1080000	1083000	I actually do have TV on my mobile, but it sucks.
1083000	1087000	And you only get limited channels, which are practically infomercials.
1087000	1091000	It's not at the same level that it's at in other countries yet.
1091000	1094000	The technology is years behind here.
1094000	1096000	It leaves a lot to be desired.
1096000	1098000	I know, it's because people have their heads up their asses.
1098000	1104000	But moving forward, also in this week's part A, number 275, you mentioned, why can't I have a white wave bird with rumble?
1104000	1106000	I've had one for over six months.
1106000	1111000	Some of the major gaming store chains in the UK have an official one, see link below.
1111000	1128000	And that is www.game.co.uk slash Wii slash hardware slash accessory slash tilde R330970 slash gameware dash Wii dash wireless dash GameCube dash control dash pad.
1128000	1133000	Just go to game.co.uk and look in the Wii section.
1133000	1137000	It works perfectly as I bought a wave bird for when Brawl comes out over here.
1137000	1141000	And out of the two, I prefer the white game controller as it has the rumble.
1141000	1149000	At 15 pounds, 30 pounds, my apologies, at 13 pounds, 30 dollars, I think is very reasonable.
1149000	1152000	I'm also favoring the wheel on Mario karts.
1152000	1157000	I'm averaging a third or fourth place online and winning all of my races offline so far.
1157000	1162000	What I've also liked was when I first went online with my Wii, I forgot to stop my PC hogging the internet.
1162000	1166000	And was thrown off during early setup stages.
1166000	1169000	I was automatically penalized about 40 points.
1169000	1176000	Although this hurt, I was delighted to see that if you drop off as a bad sport, it will cost you on your achievement score.
1176000	1179000	Cheers Mark from Plymouth.
1179000	1182000	I'm glad for the penalties as well when you drop out of there.
1182000	1185000	This is funny. This is from Plymouth, England, where the Mayflower set off.
1185000	1188000	In fact, my local pub is called the Mayflower.
1188000	1190000	Nice.
1190000	1192000	Some good perspectives from overseas.
1192000	1197000	Yeah, you have to remember sometimes the peripherals are different from one side of the pond to the other.
1197000	1201000	I didn't even think that probably Europe already has had that white.
1201000	1204000	But we had a white wave. No, I guess we didn't have a white wave bird before.
1204000	1207000	Yeah, I guess we never really had a white.
1207000	1210000	And it's not really the color that makes a lick of difference.
1210000	1213000	It's just the fact that they're kind of having a resurgence.
1213000	1218000	You know, in light of the fact that the GameCube is for all practical purposes a dead system over here.
1218000	1220000	They don't really make new ones.
1220000	1223000	It's nice to see that they're, you know, doing the wave bird.
1223000	1226000	But that is interesting that you have that particular store over in the UK.
1226000	1228000	It's been supporting it the whole time.
1228000	1230000	So, there you have it.
1230000	1232000	Are there more emails?
1232000	1234000	There are quite a few, actually.
1234000	1236000	And moving forward.
1236000	1240000	Hey, OLR, I'm writing this email on remote play on my PS3.
1240000	1245000	And I want to let you guys know about a workaround for the internet browser password protection.
1245000	1252000	If you go into folding at home and go to the team stats, all you have to do is find a team whose homepage links to Google.
1252000	1253000	Try Google.
1253000	1255000	I guess it says try Google and off you go.
1255000	1258000	Particularly helpful against tech minded parents.
1258000	1259000	Oops.
1259000	1261000	Sincerely, PK.
1261000	1264000	Is it PK junior 92?
1264000	1265000	Yes, that sounds right.
1265000	1267000	I think he friended me on Myspace recently.
1267000	1268000	I like his quote.
1268000	1272000	It says change is inevitable except from a vending machine.
1272000	1273000	I've heard that before.
1273000	1274000	Yes, that's a good quote.
1274000	1276000	What else have I heard?
1276000	1277000	Change is inevitable.
1277000	1278000	Wait, no. What is it?
1278000	1282000	You can avoid most things except death and taxes and sometimes you can cheat death.
1282000	1283000	Something like that.
1283000	1284000	It's a similar quote.
1284000	1285000	In my messed up mind.
1285000	1287000	Hi, OLR.
1287000	1292000	I just wanted to comment on Jamie saying she didn't want her gaming system to perform as anything but gaming system.
1292000	1295000	I, of course, am a PSP owner and currently that is my only system.
1295000	1299000	The reason that it is my only system is that next gen consoles are too expensive for me right now.
1299000	1303000	But I still like to play on the go and this suits me better.
1303000	1306000	The multifunction of the PSP was a major selling point for me.
1306000	1313000	The fact that my first introduction to OLR was on the PSP fanboy site in which they mentioned their favorite podcast and out of all the ones listed, I tried them all.
1313000	1314000	OLR was the best.
1314000	1315000	Well, thank you.
1315000	1323000	I have the RSS feed saved on my PSP and I plug it into my car stereo and listen to each week's show during my 30 minute commute to work all week.
1323000	1325000	So in a sense, I had never heard of OLR without my PSP.
1325000	1326000	Shocking, huh?
1326000	1329000	And yeah, my cell phone can do a lot of that crap but it can't play a decent game.
1329000	1331000	I hope Skye is feeling better.
1331000	1332000	Viva la PSP.
1332000	1337000	P.S. I might own a next gen system or two if I had enough money to buy and collect some pinball machines.
1337000	1338000	Haha.
1338000	1340000	That's from Circe 523.
1340000	1347000	And by the way, the pinball machines came about because my husband got hit by a car when he was 13.
1347000	1349000	Get run over by a truck.
1349000	1352000	We get a little bit of money every five years.
1352000	1354000	That goes to fund the pinball machine.
1354000	1356000	But it's also kind of an investment thing because you can always sell those things.
1356000	1365000	Well, he used a part of his money to start his collection and since then, the machines have sort of paid for themselves.
1365000	1368000	I notice it's like buying a house.
1368000	1372000	He'll buy a fixer upper and then fix it and then sell it for more than it was before.
1372000	1373000	Which is the way to do it.
1373000	1378000	And it also doesn't help that he has worked at a couple different, you know, as managers at a couple different video game stores.
1378000	1384000	So we've looked into all that and all of our old stuff, we've gone to flea markets.
1384000	1393000	Well, you know, as far as the PSP goes, I still appreciate it for being the multi-system that it is, doing everything that it doesn't.
1393000	1401000	You kind of give an example of that is a lot of people use a PSP as kind of like their not quite iPod but, you know, MP3 playing device as it is.
1401000	1403000	My co-worker uses his for that.
1403000	1404000	Yeah.
1404000	1405000	Just about only.
1405000	1407000	And hey, it plays games and surfs the net too, so why not?
1407000	1414000	So, yeah, you know, and especially after kind of really only having a PSP while I was on vacation this weekend.
1414000	1416000	Those things can really do quite a bit.
1416000	1417000	I enjoy it.
1417000	1418000	And those screens are so pretty.
1418000	1419000	I just can't stop saying it.
1419000	1423000	Somebody, by the way, in our forums wants to create an OLR theme for the PSP.
1423000	1427000	And I think there was kind of one on the OLR PSP site but I think they want one updated.
1427000	1431000	Well, that's just a wallpapers that we have on our site.
1431000	1433000	He's not, they're talking about actual theme.
1433000	1436000	I thought about doing it but then again, once again, going back to how lazy I am.
1436000	1437000	Yeah.
1437000	1438000	Yeah.
1438000	1439000	Well, hopefully the listeners will actually finish it.
1439000	1444000	But I saw that going on on the forums so that'll be fun because you can pimp out your PSP with OLR propaganda.
1444000	1446000	That's always fun.
1446000	1447000	That is.
1447000	1460000	And on top of that, I think that what I had clarified my statement in adding is that if what you want it for is the multiple use, that's fine but it's not a selling point for me.
1460000	1465000	You know, I would rather have a system that's got more fun games on it, I think.
1465000	1467000	You're just looking games to games.
1467000	1469000	I think it's kind of what I pick up from what you say.
1469000	1470000	You're looking at games to games.
1470000	1473000	When you look at games on the DS, you're like, that's where it's at for me.
1473000	1477000	A PSP is a primarily a gaming system.
1477000	1480000	It just happens to do all this other crap.
1480000	1487000	Whereas when I bought my iPhone, I bought it not just because it was a phone but because I needed a PDA.
1487000	1490000	When I bought it, it was my PDA slash phone.
1490000	1496000	So, see, it just depends on the purpose you're purchasing it for.
1496000	1498000	We have a couple more emails, though.
1498000	1499000	Alrighty.
1499000	1501000	Okay, this one comes from Robert M.
1501000	1511000	I saw the Half-Life episode pack Team Fortress 2 and Portal on the retail shelves, Target specifically, and despite only having a Mac laptop right now, went ahead and looked at the system requirements.
1511000	1516000	I was surprised to learn that to activate the game, you need to set up an account with Steam and register it there.
1516000	1521000	So what on God's green earth is the advantage of getting it this way rather than on Steam itself?
1521000	1526000	Also, as a Mac user, I'm pretty happy Sam and Mac Season 1 is coming to the Wii.
1526000	1536000	I can't imagine, of course, considering the PS3 port, that'd be any chance of a Wii Portal with a weighted companion GameCube.
1536000	1538000	That would be funny.
1538000	1539000	That's a damn good question about Steam.
1539000	1543000	I had no idea that that was part of the requirements for registering it until you sent that email.
1543000	1544000	That's kind of surprising.
1544000	1546000	You're right. What is the damn difference? There really isn't.
1546000	1553000	I don't know if they're doing that for the copy protection things or whatever it might be, but very interesting that you have to register your game on Steam.
1553000	1557000	I guess, you know, there's some people, though, they don't want to put their credit card out there on the internet.
1557000	1559000	So, you know, this is a way of doing it.
1559000	1562000	That was for Team Fortress 2.
1562000	1564000	They just said for the orange box games.
1564000	1568000	I don't know if they... Did he specifically say which game it was? I missed it.
1568000	1571000	He just said he grabbed one of the boxes.
1571000	1575000	Well, let's assume it's probably all of them. If it's one of them, it's probably all of them.
1575000	1577000	Well, I don't know.
1577000	1578000	I'm trying to find the email again. There we go.
1578000	1580000	RawsteelUT says to prevent early release.
1580000	1585000	I can't really see that, though, because the games have been on Steam forever.
1585000	1588000	And it happens to all Half-Life 2 games.
1588000	1590000	It's marketing. It really is just marketing, I think.
1590000	1595000	You know, you put something... The more something is out there, the more people are going to see it. That's all.
1595000	1598000	Well, plus it helps that Valve owns Steam.
1598000	1601000	I mean, don't question it. It's probably some type of...
1601000	1607000	And Steam is probably... They're probably just using Steam in general as their registration source.
1607000	1610000	I mean, because...
1610000	1616000	I honestly would rather have the physical copy, I think, than having downloaded it.
1616000	1617000	I totally get what this guy is saying, though.
1617000	1619000	But I don't mind registering it online.
1619000	1620000	But what if you do?
1620000	1624000	What if you don't want to put your information out there and all that stuff?
1624000	1626000	You know, some people don't want to give that stuff away.
1626000	1629000	So it does kind of suck that they're being forced to do it.
1629000	1634000	Well, you have to... If you buy Photoshop, you have to register it and send them all your information.
1634000	1640000	You know, if you buy... When you buy The Sims, you have to register it.
1640000	1642000	When you play World of Warcraft, you set up an account.
1642000	1644000	Yeah, but... Okay, but I'm thinking... I don't know.
1644000	1645000	Maybe I'm just going back to the old school.
1645000	1650000	Okay, if I walked in and I bought Orange Box for the Xbox 360, sure, I get that little registration card.
1650000	1652000	But half of us throw those things away.
1652000	1655000	You just plop it in, you go. No questions asked.
1655000	1658000	I don't know, but then again, maybe it's stealing everything from Xbox Live. I don't know.
1658000	1663000	See, I think part of the whole reason why they're being a little bit more on it with the registration
1663000	1668000	is just to make sure that you don't have a pirated copy, that your copy is legit.
1668000	1670000	I don't know. I don't necessarily have a problem with it.
1670000	1675000	It's just I do find it kind of weird because I would understand why somebody might go to the store to buy it
1675000	1678000	because they don't want to use Steam. I use Steam. I bought Portal off Steam.
1678000	1682000	I don't have a problem with it, but I could see why somebody might have bought the retail version
1682000	1686000	just not wanting to deal with that and to find out they have to deal with it anyway.
1686000	1689000	Well, I guess that I can see why I might be kind of pissed.
1689000	1691000	All right, one more email.
1691000	1693000	Mailbagorangelaunchradio.com. I thought you said there was one more.
1693000	1694000	No, I said there's a few more.
1694000	1695000	Well, damn it.
1695000	1697000	They're kind of long, too.
1697000	1701000	This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act deft.
1701000	1705000	First of all, and I'm going to mispronounce this because I took French, okay?
1705000	1708000	Feliz Cumpleaños.
1708000	1711000	Close. Feliz Cumpleaños, I think, is it.
1711000	1712000	To Jamie.
1712000	1713000	You know what that means?
1713000	1714000	Birthday.
1714000	1716000	Happy birthday.
1716000	1719000	I hope you had a great day, smiley face.
1719000	1721000	I did have a good day. I was very busy.
1721000	1723000	But I got free gelato at Naya.
1723000	1725000	They had Guinness gelato.
1725000	1726000	Sweet.
1726000	1727000	It was fucking good.
1727000	1731000	Anyway, the Black Sesame was not very good.
1731000	1737000	And second, because of Internet issues, I couldn't listen to the last show on live, not 365,
1737000	1739000	and the first on all games.
1739000	1742000	Luckily, I could get hold of the podcast and get my OLR fixed for the week,
1742000	1745000	and the show may be on another stream, but it's still as good as it ever was,
1745000	1747000	and in better sound quality, too.
1747000	1748000	Hearts.
1748000	1750000	Now for the serious stuff.
1750000	1752000	I was hearing the podcast for last week's show,
1752000	1754000	and you were talking about bullies banning in Brazil,
1754000	1758000	and you were asking if Latin American countries had some kind...
1758000	1760000	Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1760000	1763000	Rob, I think I just lost my connection.
1763000	1765000	So what?
1765000	1767000	I just lost my interwebs.
1767000	1768000	Yeah, you know what?
1768000	1769000	We're having problems.
1769000	1773000	The Justin TV cam went down, too, so something is wrong with the wireless networking.
1773000	1774000	So while I set up...
1774000	1776000	Do you still have that one e-mail on your screen?
1776000	1777000	Yeah.
1777000	1778000	Okay, so while...
1778000	1780000	Keep reading that while we try to set up the jerry rig real quick.
1780000	1781000	Okay.
1781000	1784000	Most of the games and stuff that's sold on Latin Americans...
1784000	1786000	Let me start over.
1786000	1787000	Now for the serious stuff.
1787000	1789000	I was hearing the podcast for last week's show,
1789000	1791000	and you were talking about bullies banning in Brazil,
1791000	1795000	and you were asking if Latin American countries had some kind of rating for games.
1795000	1797000	Well, like Footy said last week, Chile has it,
1797000	1799000	but basically that's it.
1799000	1801000	Most of the games and stuff that is sold in Latin American stores
1801000	1804000	isn't popularly rated for the audience as targeted,
1804000	1806000	and only has the ESRB rating,
1806000	1809000	but still it isn't an obligatory thing for retailers to follow.
1809000	1812000	So basically any child can go into the store and buy Grand Theft Auto
1812000	1814000	with no problems at all,
1814000	1818000	as a basic example since it's one of the best selling games in Latin America.
1818000	1820000	Although some stores do follow that ESRB rating
1820000	1823000	and do not sell an M game to a minor,
1823000	1824000	or at least younger kids,
1824000	1827000	but there aren't that many that do so,
1827000	1830000	yet it is basically up to the parents to say yes or no,
1830000	1832000	although there's another factor in play that isn't related to this,
1832000	1834000	the game's retail value.
1834000	1838000	Video games in Mexico cost at least 25% more than in the US,
1838000	1840000	so video games are kind of like a luxury here.
1840000	1843000	By the way, the cheapest console is the Wii,
1843000	1846000	which costs almost double what it costs in the US.
1846000	1848000	So not many people buy games,
1848000	1851000	and if they do buy cheap ones,
1851000	1853000	like for example bargain bin titles or low budget ones,
1853000	1856000	which brings us to another problem, piracy.
1856000	1859000	Last month I made a comment on a Skype call
1859000	1862000	that an article stating that Mexico video game industry
1862000	1865000	is going to be worth $1 billion in two years from now.
1865000	1868000	Now I wonder how they're going to manage piracy in Mexico,
1868000	1873000	which is one of the worldwide leading piracy markets for almost everything,
1873000	1875000	and if retailers don't care about their ratings,
1875000	1877000	well, you get the idea.
1877000	1881000	The most people or the main public are also ignorant in knowing
1881000	1883000	which are the games to get.
1883000	1887000	Basically you don't know if a game is good or bad or it's just a game.
1887000	1891000	Hence why titles like Cars got into the best-selling games list of 2006.
1891000	1894000	The same goes for other titles like FIFA or PES
1894000	1897000	and any anime game title, DBZ for example.
1897000	1900000	So in the end, it's just basically a cultural thing
1900000	1903000	since most of Latin America is accustomed to different things
1903000	1906000	than the US and Canada, especially in the way media is handled.
1906000	1909000	Basically you can watch someone holding and firing a gun
1909000	1911000	in daytime afternoon TV.
1911000	1914000	If you have the chance to watch any Mexican news shows or similar,
1914000	1917000	do so and you'll understand what I am talking about.
1917000	1922000	On a side note, Mexican congressmen don't want a video game,
1922000	1925000	I guess don't know what a video game rating is
1925000	1927000	or since they're trying to rate games but by health issues
1927000	1930000	and not by the actual contents of the game.
1930000	1933000	He actually did link a GameSpot article in Spanish,
1933000	1936000	but I wouldn't be able to read it,
1936000	1938000	but I'll put it in the chat room once I'm back in there.
1938000	1940000	Well, that's all for now.
1940000	1942000	I'll hear you on Sunday's show. Adios.
1942000	1947000	P.S. Rob, when are we going to give away the ResHD code?
1947000	1950000	You know, it's sad. I actually completely forgot about that.
1950000	1953000	I know it sounds horrible, but just with everything else that had been going on,
1953000	1956000	so we will probably throw it into a future contest.
1956000	1959000	I don't know, maybe we can give it away as part of this Grand Theft Auto thing as a runner-up prize.
1959000	1961000	I don't know, we'll figure it out.
1961000	1963000	But I do want to give it away.
1963000	1966000	If somebody doesn't have it by now, we need to just give it away.
1966000	1970000	At some point, we're just going to set up an email and try to get it out that way.
1970000	1973000	By the way, if you switch networks, we should be back up.
1973000	1975000	We have the Jerry Rigg network up.
1975000	1978000	I have to get back in chat, so I won't be able to do it.
1978000	1980000	Switcheroos!
1980000	1982000	God damn it.
1982000	1987000	Yeah, it went over one of the emails.
1987000	1991000	Actually, yeah, it's been two months since it was given to me.
1991000	1993000	We haven't given it away.
1993000	1996000	The PS reminded me that Q Entertainment is doing a special kind of survey
1996000	2001000	in which you can ask Tetsuya Mizuguchi a question for their newsletter.
2001000	2005000	If you haven't already said so on the show, perhaps it's only ten questions that will be picked.
2005000	2009000	More info is on that game called res.com
2009000	2014000	slash VBulletin slash showthread dot PHP question mark T equals 90.
2014000	2017000	PSSS, Second Life on cell phones.
2017000	2020000	I'm a furry and I find that highly hilarious.
2020000	2025000	I'd be curious to know from Mizuguchi if 99 Nights is something they're going to try to do again.
2025000	2028000	I mean, because I know that game got a lot of slack when it first came out,
2028000	2034000	but there's a good game in there somewhere, and maybe they could get it on a second go.
2034000	2040000	Otherwise, I would hope maybe they could do, I don't know, maybe Gun Pay on Xbox Live Arcade.
2040000	2044000	We'll see what happens with that.
2044000	2048000	Well, we've got one more email.
2048000	2050000	Is it up on the screen? No, two more emails.
2050000	2051000	We have more emails.
2051000	2052000	My God, it keeps growing.
2052000	2058000	No, it's not, it keeps growing. I told you that we had several.
2058000	2061000	Okay, this one comes from Osfer, seven questions.
2061000	2063000	Hey Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.
2063000	2067000	This afternoon I was bored, so I thought, what the hell, why not randomly make ten questions to ask you guys,
2067000	2071000	because you know that's the first thing that comes to everyone's mind when they're bored, right?
2071000	2072000	One, Rob.
2072000	2075000	What's your favorite galaxy in Super Mario Galaxies?
2075000	2079000	And Osfer says, I love Space Junk Galaxy because it pretty much says gravity.
2079000	2082000	Who gives a shit? The music is all relaxing, too.
2082000	2086000	The Bumblebee Galaxy, because you can be a bumblebee, and that's the best thing in the game.
2086000	2087000	I love Bee Mario.
2087000	2088000	A question for me.
2088000	2090000	Jamie, what's your favorite pinball game?
2090000	2094000	And he says he doesn't play much pinball, be like the Gilligan's Island machine.
2094000	2098000	World Cup Soccer 94, without a doubt.
2098000	2102000	Loki, what is your favorite course out of all the Mario Kart series?
2102000	2104000	And he says that he likes Rainbow Road from Mario Kart 64.
2104000	2107000	I hate Mario Kart's Rainbow Road.
2107000	2115000	I would say probably, I like Wario Stadium from Nintendo 64 a lot.
2115000	2119000	Actually, a lot of the courses from 64 are pretty awesome.
2119000	2124000	I would probably say, I don't know, probably Wario Stadium.
2124000	2126000	I think that's the most that I've played, is that one.
2126000	2130000	That, and also, I don't remember what it's called.
2130000	2133000	I think it was Peach's Circuit or something like that.
2133000	2138000	It's the one that's got the giant ramp from Nintendo 64.
2138000	2139000	I don't know.
2139000	2141000	But I'd say probably Wario Stadium.
2141000	2142000	I love Toad's Highway.
2142000	2143000	I know I wasn't asked this question.
2143000	2144000	Toad's Highway is pretty awesome, too.
2144000	2149000	Frickin' love Toad's Highway.
2149000	2151000	So, I don't know.
2151000	2155000	What would be your dream Mario Kart course in a future Mario game?
2155000	2161000	They should do one that's all pixelated and 8-bit like Super Mario Brothers.
2161000	2162000	I think that'd be pretty cool.
2162000	2163000	Nice.
2163000	2164000	Mode 7-tastic.
2164000	2167000	Or a better Haunted Mansion course.
2167000	2171000	One that's actually a bit of platforming stuff.
2171000	2173000	That'd be pretty cool.
2173000	2175000	Or one that's based...
2175000	2181000	What they need to do is add some of the characters from Mario RPG into a future one.
2181000	2185000	Including that one villain guy who was raining around the entire time.
2185000	2186000	Nice.
2186000	2187000	I don't remember his name.
2187000	2189000	We have a fan of Moo Moo Farm in the house.
2189000	2190000	Frisbee likes Moo Moo.
2190000	2191000	Is that the one with the train?
2191000	2193000	I love that one.
2193000	2195000	Moo Moo Farm is fun.
2195000	2197000	Good times.
2197000	2199000	Alright.
2199000	2201000	The next question is...
2201000	2202000	This is for all three of us.
2202000	2204000	Who are your favorite Brawl characters?
2204000	2207000	And Osprey says Wolf O'Donnell is mine.
2207000	2210000	Obviously his howling taunt is amazing and he fights like a dream.
2210000	2213000	I'm just gonna really go back to my favorite of all time.
2213000	2214000	I was a big Sheik person.
2214000	2218000	That Kirby was always my person.
2218000	2219000	I think.
2219000	2221000	I love Ness.
2221000	2228000	But I think I'd freaking love Pit in this new one too much.
2228000	2230000	Loki?
2230000	2232000	My favorite character?
2232000	2235000	I liked...
2235000	2239000	Actually...
2239000	2240000	I liked Rob.
2240000	2241000	Rob the Robot.
2241000	2242000	That was fun.
2242000	2244000	I like me too.
2244000	2246000	I'm great.
2246000	2247000	Next question.
2247000	2248000	Yes.
2248000	2251000	What would you do if World of Warcraft was shut down and you could never play it again?
2251000	2252000	He says I hate World of Warcraft.
2252000	2255000	I'd go back to Final Fantasy 11 just to piss you off.
2255000	2256000	Here's one for me.
2256000	2257000	He says here's a toughie for you.
2257000	2260000	In the end what console do you think will come out on top in this gens console?
2260000	2263000	Wars PS3 360 or the Wii?
2263000	2266000	And he thinks it's between the 360 and the Wii but I'll have to say Wii.
2266000	2268000	I love my PS3 but...
2268000	2269000	Yeah.
2269000	2271000	360.
2271000	2276000	Just because it's got the online play perfect.
2276000	2280000	Well, as perfect as it can be given current technology.
2280000	2282000	It's got a really great library.
2282000	2288000	Lots of stuff that's for people of any age and, you know, type of game that they like.
2288000	2290000	It's pretty versatile, I'd have to say.
2290000	2293000	So I'm going to say the 360 in terms of...
2293000	2297000	First of all, it already had an audience when it came out.
2297000	2301000	And secondly, the learning curve was really, really small on it.
2301000	2303000	So...
2303000	2305000	I think I'm right.
2305000	2306000	Alrighty.
2306000	2307000	Last question for Loki.
2307000	2309000	You get the last one.
2309000	2311000	What is your favorite game and why?
2311000	2315000	And he says Final Fantasy X is the only game to ever make me pull an all-nighter so I'd
2315000	2317000	have to say that and the runner-up is Brawl.
2317000	2319000	Well, I don't know.
2319000	2320000	It depends when you ask me.
2320000	2325000	Well, if you're asking me now, I'd probably say...
2325000	2327000	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is pretty fun.
2327000	2328000	I don't know.
2328000	2330000	I play a lot of things for O.
2330000	2332000	I don't have a favorite game.
2332000	2333000	I don't like to pick one that's just favorite.
2333000	2336000	Because I go from one to another, you know, all the time.
2336000	2338000	But...
2338000	2340000	Yeah, I'd say right now Saints Row.
2340000	2342000	But I know that's not my absolute favorite.
2342000	2346000	My favorite game is Super Metroid, but most of Chad already knew that.
2346000	2348000	Well, you know what mine is.
2348000	2349000	Alright.
2349000	2350000	Guardian Legend!
2350000	2351000	So enough of wasting your time.
2351000	2352000	I went about that faceplate.
2352000	2355000	Take your time with it and I understand you guys have enough to manage.
2355000	2358000	I'm still working on getting one, but I think someone else is supposed to bring one.
2358000	2361000	And I've got all the stuff to work on it.
2361000	2362000	We'll figure it out.
2362000	2363000	We'll talk amongst ourselves.
2363000	2364000	Thanks for reading, Oscar.
2364000	2367000	P.S. Rob, I hope your pancreas get better.
2367000	2368000	I hope so too.
2368000	2370000	I wish you would come to ASEN, cries.
2370000	2372000	I wish you would come to ASEN as well.
2372000	2379000	However, Penny Arcade Expo is like 95% certain for me at this point.
2379000	2381000	The last email.
2381000	2382000	Thank god, I mean...
2382000	2384000	Holy shit!
2384000	2386000	Thank you, RawstillUT.
2386000	2387000	Is it long?
2387000	2389000	Yes.
2389000	2390000	I'm gonna read it though.
2390000	2391000	Duke Cliff Notes.
2391000	2392000	DC vs. Mortal Kombat.
2392000	2394000	A horrifying concept not because of graphics.
2394000	2396000	Mortal Kombat hasn't used mocap graphics in ages.
2396000	2398000	I was bringing that up as an example.
2398000	2401000	But because, according to Kotaku, there isn't going to be any fatalities.
2401000	2403000	The blood will be incredibly limited.
2403000	2404000	Why the hell would anyone bother?
2404000	2406000	I think we've covered that.
2406000	2408000	Well, the fighting styles...
2408000	2413000	However, that wasn't the main topic I wanted to discuss.
2413000	2418000	The idea of higher meaning in games.
2418000	2420000	Meaning in art in general.
2420000	2428000	You often hear complaints from gamers about games not having esoteric higher meaning compared to other mediums.
2428000	2434000	However, many people bring up movies, books, paintings that are either A, really blatant in their meetings.
2434000	2435000	Schindler's List, Blood Diamond.
2435000	2440000	Or B, way too damned esoteric and oddball for anyone to get on their own, which is Akira.
2440000	2447000	By the way, in defense of Akira, it was a cliff note version of a really freaking long manga that...
2447000	2451000	I'm not even going to go into it, just read the manga.
2451000	2457000	My view has always been that if it's too complex for someone to get without a fucking explanation by the creator, it isn't worth the time.
2457000	2459000	By the same... Well, you should watch Shock Treatment then.
2459000	2462000	Then you'll find out what...
2462000	2469000	By the way, this Friday, April 25th in San Francisco, Shock Treatment.
2469000	2472000	I'm not performing in it anymore, though, due to my sickness.
2472000	2473000	I couldn't do rehearsals.
2473000	2474000	But I'm still going.
2474000	2478000	My view has always been that if... Okay, I've read that part.
2478000	2485000	By the same token, hammering someone over the head with a message and not leaving room for subtle metaphor and commenting comes off as preachy,
2485000	2490000	a primary reason I can barely stand Kojima's sledgehammer style in the Metal Gear Solid series.
2490000	2496000	I've always thought that a metaphor, hence an innuendo, made the best way to convey a message in entertainment media.
2496000	2501000	Look at the way humans generally have distrust of aliens and vice versa in Mass Effect, for example.
2501000	2507000	While a cliché in and of itself, the way it's presented shows just how ugly racism is.
2507000	2512000	Final Fantasy VII had a very strong pro-environment message hidden in the belts and zippers of Nomura's design,
2512000	2521000	with Mako and the Lifestream an effective metaphor for the oil we've ripped from the earth and the land and animals we routinely exploit.
2521000	2526000	Often there is something to be taken other than simple entertainment if you look hard enough.
2526000	2532000	And it's also sometimes small meanings can be found in even the most mundane parts of games.
2532000	2539000	For example, there's a part in Rainbow Six Vegas 2 where, warning spoilers, your team is sent in to check three buildings for a bomb.
2539000	2541000	Should I read this?
2541000	2546000	Who cares? Just try to sum it up in one sentence. I don't know.
2546000	2554000	It's basically dealing with having to deal with a failure instead of it being a game over.
2554000	2561000	Instead of game over, start over. You failed. You have to deal with it.
2561000	2565000	I would like to see a video game tell you that. You fail at life. Deal with it.
2565000	2568000	Oh my god, they set us up the bomb.
2568000	2572000	It's more like you fail. Here's your consequences for what you screwed up on.
2572000	2579000	I often wonder if the call for higher meaning in games is just from people who want to join the stuck up art connoisseur club.
2579000	2590000	Me, I've always found the word art to be nothing more than something old, rich, often white men used to hold up what they prefer while simultaneously putting down anything made by the lower classes as being unworthy of the art designation.
2590000	2594000	It's not surprising. In his time, William Shakespeare was considered a lowbrow playwright.
2594000	2598000	Now, hundreds of years after his death, he's considered one of the greatest playwrights of all time.
2598000	2604000	What isn't heralded for all time won't be decided by us, but by those who come long after and look back.
2604000	2612000	Maybe one day, stuck up elites will hold up lost odyssey and no more heroes as a pinnacle of art and gaming. Just something to think about.
2612000	2615000	You know, that's a very interesting point, I must say.
2615000	2623000	It's going to be very interesting to see what kind of games are truly remembered as classics and will it be the things that were necessarily popular today. I don't know.
2623000	2627000	Another aside, I love the new PlayStation Store. It's even better than Marketplace now.
2627000	2631000	So easy to find everything in the games installed automatically now. It's wonderful.
2631000	2636000	Finally, and yes I know I'm rambling, here's another anti-digital distribution warning.
2636000	2643000	Way back in 1981, a service called Play Cable came out which allowed you to download Intellivision games through your cable system.
2643000	2650000	The problem is that the adapter only had 4K of RAM and when Intellivision games started coming out in 8K and 16K carts,
2650000	2654000	the Play Cable service was rendered useless and was discontinued in 1993.
2654000	2658000	The moral of the story is that files will always outgrow bandwidth.
2658000	2661000	Who the hell wants to download 50 gigs of Metal Gear Solid 4?
2661000	2666000	What about when games start taking up triple-even, quadruple-layer Blu-ray discs 100 gigs?
2666000	2677000	Movie and game files aren't going to stand still for the sake of bandwidth, especially when ISPs are our heart set on raping consumers for bandwidth in the US, Europe, and especially Australia.
2677000	2681000	Well, you're going to be seeing discs for a long, long time. You're truly Russell, UT.
2681000	2684000	That is such a freakin' good letter.
2684000	2695000	Alright. If you want to send us good letters, mailbag at orangelaunterator.com, but try to keep it to 500 words or less, just so we have time to read them all in the air.
2695000	2697000	Send me something to drink with every email.
2697000	2701000	Alright, let's get back to some gaming news.
2701000	2705000	And we'll go to Loki about Bionic Commando, yes?
2705000	2725000	Bionic Commando Rearmed has been rated by the ESRB. It is, of course, rated M, and they didn't really specify why it's rated M, but it, I think, has to do with the game's main villain's head exploding.
2725000	2727000	Spoilers.
2727000	2734000	So that's pretty awesome. I just like the fact that it's rated. That means it's on its way, and hopefully will be out very soon.
2734000	2741000	And along with it, hopefully will come Castle Crashers, because I hope that game's out very soon as well.
2741000	2743000	Awesome.
2743000	2748000	I am very excited for Bionic Commando Rearmed. It's going to be hot, because the old one is a hot game.
2748000	2755000	Alright, moving on to more Grand Theft Auto stories, but this may not be exactly what you're looking for.
2755000	2764000	It seems like there were a lot of pre-orders for Grand Theft Auto IV in Australia, but now Australians are starting to cancel their pre-orders big time.
2764000	2770000	This has to do with the latest censorship in the game. You remember last week we talked about the Australian version of Grand Theft Auto as being censored?
2770000	2777000	And I guess it had something to do with, what was it, somebody putting a gun in somebody else's private parts or something?
2777000	2779000	Yes, a gun up the rectum, I believe.
2779000	2786000	I'm sure it's hilarious. However, due to this, many Australian gamers are cancelling their orders, and this is according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
2786000	2793000	Already they are pissed off, because the game is going to cost $120 versus $64, Australian.
2793000	2802000	Gamers are really reacting with outrage. Gamers are saying they cancelled their orders with Australian shops and will import a cheaper uncut version.
2802000	2804000	Going around the law.
2804000	2810000	That is true. PlayStation 3 is region-free, so there you go.
2810000	2816000	If you're in Australia and you want a region-free or uncut version of the game, import it.
2816000	2820000	Frisbee wants to know, let me ask a question, did Saw IV get shown in Australia?
2820000	2824000	Very good question. I mean, seriously.
2824000	2838000	Well, this is a very interesting, though, kind of counter-reaction to this, is that you have all these people that are cancelling the game and realising that the PS3 is region-free, so they're just like, you know what, screw it, we're going to import it.
2838000	2841000	Very interesting combat.
2841000	2850000	Some 360 games are region-free too, so it'll be interesting to see the further fallout from this, but regardless, censorship kind of pisses us off,
2850000	2859000	and so we dedicate the FUs of the week to all these people that just said FU to the Australian Censorship Board that are going to import their copies instead.
2859000	2882000	My FU of the week is not really directed toward the person, but toward the situation.
2882000	2893000	I got woke up, well, I had already woke up once and then passed right back out, but I was woke up from a dead sleep by someone calling me, saying that I left my keys in her car.
2893000	2898000	And Rob, you know what I am when I'm just waking up. I'm incoherent.
2898000	2903000	So, I have no idea what she's talking about. I still think I'm dreaming, okay?
2903000	2906000	And I was like, but I need my keys.
2906000	2914000	She's like, I can't bring them to you, you're the one who left them, and just being really condescending and rude about it. I was like, wait, what the hell are you talking about?
2914000	2918000	I was like, I need my house key too.
2918000	2921000	She's like, you don't have a copy? I was like, I don't know.
2921000	2928000	She's being really rude about it, but I was like, look, I just woke up, you don't need to be condescending and rude, okay?
2928000	2932000	I'm not going to put up with that shit. I don't put up with it from anybody if I can help it.
2932000	2945000	Um, also, um, FU to, um, I guess I don't really have much else in the way of FUs.
2945000	2947000	Oh yeah, FU the stupid kids at the park.
2947000	2953000	Cause we, um, my friend Sonia came over and we took pictures of the doffy that I finished for Kristen.
2953000	2955000	And, um, one of mine.
2955000	2957000	These stupid kids are coming like, why are you taking pictures of dolls?
2957000	2960000	I'm like, why does anybody take pictures of anything?
2960000	2962000	I was like, don't be stupid.
2962000	2964000	So, that was it.
2964000	2966000	Loki.
2966000	2968000	FU to this chair I'm sitting in.
2968000	2970000	That's it.
2970000	2978000	FU to Subway, who I suspect gave me food poisoning on my vacation that kept me in bed until 6pm yesterday,
2978000	2981000	meaning I missed out on two trips to the beach.
2981000	2983000	That kind of pisses me off.
2983000	2988000	I mean, I guess I should be thankful I got to go on the trip at all because the state of my pancreas was a little bit in question,
2988000	2990000	you know, with everything I've been going through recently.
2990000	2992000	But still, food poisoning sucks.
2992000	2994000	At least I didn't have it for two weeks.
2994000	2997000	People shouldn't be sick on their vacations.
2997000	2999000	What kind of horrible punishment is that?
2999000	3001000	What did I do to you, Mother Nature?
3001000	3003000	What did I do to you?
3003000	3005000	Alright, let's get back into the show.
3005000	3008000	Get back into some more gaming news, eh, Jamie?
3008000	3011000	I think that that's entirely doable, Rob.
3011000	3013000	Oh, good.
3013000	3015000	Yes.
3015000	3019000	So apparently Wii games look like crap, or most of them do.
3019000	3028000	According to the developer High Voltage, they're basically claiming that most of the end products for the Wii don't look as good as latter-day PS2 titles.
3028000	3033000	And this is, of course, after they have said they're working on something called Conduit,
3033000	3042000	which is a first-person shooter boasting to be really advanced and supposed to actually be, I guess, the best one on the system.
3042000	3051000	They're quoted as saying that they think it's a real shame that publishers and developers aren't taking advantage of the technical possibilities of the Wii platform.
3051000	3056000	Most Wii games don't even look as good as latter-day PS2 titles, and that's a real slap to the face of consumers.
3056000	3060000	So they're saying that they're wanting to raise a new bar.
3060000	3063000	But honestly, and how many times have I said this?
3063000	3068000	It doesn't matter what the hell the game looks like, as long as it's fun.
3068000	3071000	I don't know, their engine looked pretty nice.
3071000	3077000	I mean, Katamari Damacy, let's face it, looks like crap, but a lot of people really enjoy the heck out of that game because it's fun.
3077000	3079000	Good point.
3079000	3083000	I'm sure the soccer moms of America who have been throwing themselves behind the Wii don't really care.
3083000	3087000	Although I like to have both. I like to have a pretty game that's fun.
3087000	3090000	Is that too much to ask? I don't think so.
3090000	3092000	I don't think so.
3092000	3099000	Well, they actually, High Voltage released a tech demo of their new engine, and it does look pretty good.
3099000	3102000	Although the graphics still aren't that great.
3102000	3109000	I mean, it's pretty impressive what they can do with the Wii, and it is a bit limited on hardware muscle.
3109000	3113000	But still though, there's games out there you can make look pretty nice.
3113000	3118000	Like Mario Galaxy looks pretty nice for it, and Brawl wasn't too bad.
3118000	3125000	But yeah, I do see their point that some of the games are kind of lacking in polish, especially a lot of shovelware stuff out there.
3125000	3129000	Well, what is it? The Wii is just two Gamecubes duct taped together or whatever?
3129000	3134000	Well, it's not even that. It's just people are looking at the Wii as a cheap developing platform,
3134000	3138000	and so they're putting no effort into releasing games for it.
3138000	3142000	They're just charging like 20 bucks for them, but they're garbage.
3142000	3145000	So, that's the problem.
3145000	3151000	One game that's not quite garbage though is coming to Steam pretty soon here.
3151000	3160000	Luminous. Actually, Q Entertainment and Valve have joined forces, and now Luminous will be available on the service.
3160000	3164000	It looks like a few different packs you can get.
3164000	3173000	The base pack for $9.95 will be available, as well as the advanced pack containing 21 new challenge mode skins,
3173000	3178000	60 puzzles for puzzle mode, and 35 stages for puzzle mode.
3178000	3184000	That'll come out for another $7.95, or you can grab the whole thing for $14.95.
3184000	3188000	And that'll be made available Friday, April 25th.
3188000	3193000	If you didn't already have Luminous in one of the 5,000 other places it's available, there's your chance. Right?
3193000	3194000	Yeah.
3194000	3195000	Alright.
3195000	3199000	Well, usually on this program we give out this thing called the Stupid Award,
3199000	3206000	and it usually goes out to some kid who shoots up his friends due to bad parenting, what turns out to be in the end.
3206000	3214000	But tonight we might have the example of an opposite, is that we have good parenting leaving the smackdown on a bad kid.
3214000	3216000	So we might actually have an opposite.
3216000	3222000	This is one of those feel-good stories, you know, when we always have all this bad news about stupid kids.
3222000	3224000	We might have some good news here.
3224000	3226000	This has to do with the mother of one teenager.
3226000	3235000	What happened is that this kid was supposed to be doing some chores, but he decided to break the vacuum cleaner so that he didn't have to do any work.
3235000	3243000	So what happened is that the mom went on to Craigslist, and this posting was found on Richmond's Craigslist, and it says this.
3243000	3249000	My son seems to think everything should be handed to him on a silver platter, so the Xbox is going bye-bye.
3249000	3253000	I do have an assortment of games as well that I will sell for $15 each.
3253000	3259000	Prices firm, must replace vacuum that he broke, thinking it would get him out of having to do chores.
3259000	3267000	By the way, the mother has also informed the world that she's busted him for looking at porn sites.
3267000	3279000	The internet access is now locked behind a password, and mom apparently went onto his MySpace and put a picture of Snoopy on the MySpace.
3279000	3288000	This is a mom that is taking no crap from her kid and violating his privacy in every sense of the word.
3288000	3298000	But what is the old saying? As long as you live under our house, I will log onto your MySpace and put up pictures of Snoopy.
3298000	3304000	Yeah, like GS68 in chat says, it could have been worse. It could have been Hello Kitty.
3304000	3310000	But I think Snoopy means she's snooping. I think there was a pun there.
3310000	3319000	But good job for her bringing the smackdown. You're right, sometimes kids are brats. I don't know, selling the Xbox off might be a bit extreme.
3319000	3324000	But I don't know, if this kid has repetitive issues, then maybe it's what has to be done.
3324000	3327000	I mean, I'm not going to tell you how to raise your kid in that sense. You know what's best.
3327000	3332000	But that does seem a little extreme. This must have been one bad fucking kid for that to happen.
3332000	3340000	I think so. Although, see, I can't really say much because I was a real brat when I was a kid.
3340000	3342000	I think we all were at one point in our lives.
3342000	3346000	My mom took away my Nintendo one time. This is my brand new Nintendo that my daddy bought me.
3346000	3350000	So I was like, I went back in her room and got it and hooked it back up by myself.
3350000	3355000	And she's like, I took that away from you. I was like, my daddy gave that to me. And if you take it, it's theft.
3355000	3363000	I love all the pictures that they have and like these responses and stuff that the vacuum cleaner says do not want.
3363000	3365000	Lovely.
3365000	3369000	That's great. No, I was a bad kid. I was a bad kid.
3369000	3374000	I was naughty when I was like three or four. I was always the bad kid that had to go time out in class.
3374000	3380000	And then I turned into a perfect little angel. And that's how I am today. Right? Right?
3380000	3382000	You got your halo hung up by horns.
3382000	3384000	Yeah, whatever. Back to gaming news.
3384000	3389000	Yeah, I was going to say we got we got other games to talk about, too.
3389000	3393000	But kudos for that mom for having balls anyway.
3393000	3398000	Our buddies at Namco Bandai have brought us some shooting stuff.
3398000	3402000	So they have really in the summer.
3402000	3407000	There is Power Up Forever, an Xbox Live arcade and PlayStation Network,
3407000	3415000	which is a top down shooter where as you shoot things, you absorb their energy and you grow.
3415000	3424000	So you. I'm not going to compare this with Katamari as the article compares it with Katamari.
3424000	3431000	However, I see it as more of expanding your universe, you know, a perspective type thing.
3431000	3438000	The bigger you get, the more you can see, you know, because it's supposed to as you get more power ups,
3438000	3443000	you're supposed to see larger and larger enemies that were always there.
3443000	3448000	But you just couldn't see them before because you were needle.
3448000	3456000	But it's supposed to be like an infinitely going game, I guess.
3456000	3461000	It just goes on and on, my friend. This is the game that never ends.
3461000	3464000	It just goes on and on, my friend.
3464000	3468000	I hate my laptop, actually.
3468000	3473000	I was just thinking, you know, we don't have enough space shooters on Xbox Live arcade or PlayStation three.
3473000	3476000	So I was really hoping we would get some more. Don't worry, Rob.
3476000	3482000	They will never. Weren't you just thinking that, too? Like, I'm like, God, what is it we're missing on Xbox Live music?
3482000	3486000	No, we have Boom Boom Rocket. That's all we need. What are we missing? Adventure games?
3486000	3493000	Oh, no, we have the Arcadian Quest. Oh, space shooters. We don't have any of those.
3493000	3494000	That's what we need.
3494000	3498000	But wasn't there galaxy wars? Geometry wars?
3498000	3500000	I was being facetious.
3500000	3503000	I know, and I was going, boom.
3503000	3508000	Hey, Rob. What?
3508000	3517000	One thing that we don't have enough or I'm sure we're not going to have enough pretty soon of is games that are going to use the brand new balance board that's coming with Wii Fit.
3517000	3522000	Well, fear not, because Take-Two has decided, hey, guess what?
3522000	3527000	Don King's Prize Fighter? That's right, bitches. It's going to have balance board training games.
3527000	3529000	Oh, boy.
3529000	3537000	Because when you're done playing Wii Fit, you can get Wii Fit again with, you know, training games and the...
3537000	3549000	I don't know. It's a boxing game that has a bunch of actually kind of almost rhythm games to it to train in, but now you can use the Wii Fit balance board as well.
3549000	3554000	Because when I think Don King, I think Wii Fit DDR-ish type thing.
3554000	3559000	Well, it's a boxing game, okay? I know. Maybe they'll have like...
3559000	3567000	Well, that might actually be kind of fun. A game that combines Wii boxing with the Wii Fit board for balance. That actually could be kind of cool.
3567000	3571000	Except this is the training portion. I don't think it's going to actually have, you know...
3571000	3582000	But here's the thing that I think would be pretty funny. They could use like a balance board mini game or something like that where you have to stay balanced on Don King's hair.
3582000	3585000	That might be challenging.
3585000	3592000	That would definitely be challenging. Another game that a lot of folks are looking forward to, no really, would be Quake Live.
3592000	3598000	You might remember Quake Live was once known as Quake Zero. It's basically Quake 3 but on the web.
3598000	3604000	Hey, guess what? You can now sign up for the beta program if you head on over to QuakeLive.com.
3604000	3609000	Basically all you're doing is you're giving them your email address, probably no doubt so they can spam you and all that stuff.
3609000	3613000	But hey, it's Quake 3 and it's on the web and it's going to be free.
3613000	3615000	Quake 3 was my favorite in the series.
3615000	3625000	Not to knock betas or anything. I love signing up for betas. For some reason I don't play them once I sign up for them.
3625000	3629000	I guess I'm not really their prime beta candidate.
3629000	3637000	I really wish there was betas for things other than, I don't know, first person shooters might be nice.
3637000	3644000	I know that they do have the occasional beta for an MMO game, but I don't play MMOs anymore.
3644000	3646000	But something else would be nice.
3646000	3653000	I get it. Usually the thing is, what are they trying to beta test? They're trying to stress test their servers.
3653000	3658000	I would stress test, I don't know, Animal Crossing. I'd be down with that.
3658000	3660000	Or a racing game.
3660000	3664000	I somehow doubt it because Nintendo is kind of their own little box.
3664000	3668000	They don't really care about the quality they're on anyways, so that's fine.
3668000	3672000	I don't know, maybe like a racing game or something. That might be pretty cool.
3672000	3676000	But don't expect it to work perfectly because it is a beta.
3676000	3679000	Oh well.
3679000	3684000	So, I don't know. You can check that out again.
3684000	3690000	Quakelive.com if you want to sign up for the Quake Live beta. I just might because I do love Quake 3 that much.
3690000	3695000	It's one of my, the only FPSs I really played a whole lot of that I just enjoyed very much.
3695000	3702000	Well, for any of our listeners in Japan, because this is probably only coming out there,
3702000	3708000	Squeenix has a new RPG for the mobile phones and it's called ELLARK.
3708000	3712000	It's a free online RPG though.
3712000	3717000	And it will be launched in June for the three major Japanese characters.
3717000	3727000	But it's, this style looks sort of Final Fantasy, the little bit of artwork I'm seeing is sort of Final Fantasy tactics-tastic.
3727000	3730000	So maybe.
3730000	3733000	Well it is free.
3733000	3737000	Free if you live somewhere else than here.
3737000	3739000	Because our cell phones suck.
3739000	3742000	They only barely do TV.
3742000	3745000	Even Europe is kicking our butt in cell phones.
3745000	3751000	Well, here's one thing we aren't going to be free of anytime soon and that is new Spider-Man games.
3751000	3752000	Oh joy.
3752000	3753000	Hurrah!
3753000	3761000	Still trying to recapture their triumph of, was it, the PlayStation version of Spider-Man 2.
3761000	3764000	Probably one of the greatest Spider-Man games that they've made so far.
3764000	3772000	Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man Friend or Foe weren't very good.
3772000	3781000	But Web of Shadows, the brand new game that was confirmed after being sort of leaked out, hopes to change all that.
3781000	3791000	And it's going to be a free roaming open-ended adventure that's going to be headed to, I guess, all of the current consoles out there and handhelds.
3791000	3797000	And is being brought to you by Shaba Games and Treyarch.
3797000	3805000	And I didn't really say what the game's going to revolve around but there's a lot of Venom looking stuff.
3805000	3812000	And they also said there's possibly other Marvel Universe characters that you'll actually get to play as as well.
3812000	3814000	They hinted to that stuff.
3814000	3816000	So, I don't know.
3816000	3817000	Neat, I guess.
3817000	3822000	But just the last, I remember when Spider-Man games used to be good.
3822000	3824000	You don't trust the track record of Spider-Man games.
3824000	3826000	The last few games have really sucked.
3826000	3830000	Especially, I mean, Spider-Man 3 where you'd sink into the grass like quicksand.
3830000	3831000	That's funny.
3831000	3833000	ssj100matt kind of agrees with you.
3833000	3835000	He says, I'm a sucker for free roam New York City games.
3835000	3839000	I'm really hoping this game doesn't suck.
3839000	3840000	We shall see.
3840000	3842000	Hey, our Skype line is just about open.
3842000	3845000	We only have a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the Skype line before we get onto our program.
3845000	3849000	1877 Game OLR is the phone number or our username on Skype.
3849000	3851000	Get ready, Orange Lounge Radio.
3851000	3853000	But first, we have to do a quick follow-up.
3853000	3863000	Remember last week we talked about that Famitsu was reporting or was saying that a new DS is very likely to be announced at the next E3.
3863000	3866000	Well, Nintendo came right out and denied it.
3866000	3876000	They denied it and said, no, we are not making a new DS and we're not really revealing anything that we're going to be revealing at E3 until E3.
3876000	3891000	It should be noted, however, that a couple years ago, one day before it was announced, Nintendo denied having any knowledge about a DS Lite and then a day later the DS Lite was announced.
3891000	3905000	So, you know, you can always take Nintendo denials with a grain of salt, but at the same time, the original news has a bit of a grain of salt as well because it's probably based simply off the fact that, gee, Nintendo likes to redo their consoles all the time.
3905000	3918000	Also, was it the publisher of Famitsu was the one originally quoting that that was going to be announced at E3 and then they retracted that statement too, which is interesting.
3918000	3923000	I don't know. Just wait for E3, what, a few months away? Seriously.
3923000	3930000	All right. One more story, then the Skype line is open. Dark Sakura, our final official story for the evening.
3930000	3944000	Um, well, there is going to be some good news for Mass Effect PC players and that is the, um, actually, uh, free content. Free content is nice, isn't it?
3944000	3945000	Yay, free!
3945000	3953000	Um, but that's the, um, Bring Down the Sky is going to be free for anyone who's interested in it.
3953000	3963000	Is it bad that I didn't even realize Mass Effect was on PC? Like, I thought it was an Xbox 360 only game for some reason. I'm just, I'm just out of it, I guess.
3963000	3966000	Well, they had to pay for it on Xbox Live for five bucks.
3966000	3971000	Yeah, but that's kind of cool that they gave it for free on PC. Maybe they just couldn't think of a way to charge for it.
3971000	3973000	It's in pieces of their soul.
3973000	3984000	Who knows. All right, well, it's also free for you to call in and interact with us on our Skype line 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
3984000	3988000	And once you know it, we're already getting hammered with phone calls, so let's open up the lines.
3988000	3990000	Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
3990000	3992000	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma from New York.
3992000	3998000	Ranma from New York. Do you like the free roaming New York City games as well? Like, SSJ100Matt?
3998000	4000000	I just heard about it myself.
4000000	4007000	What about, like, Grand Theft Auto and all these types of other games that are parodying New York? Do you like seeing parodies of your home city?
4007000	4009000	Sure, I'm all for it.
4009000	4011000	All right, all for it. All right, what did you call in and talk to us about tonight?
4011000	4014000	Well, before I begin, Jamie, happy birthday.
4014000	4015000	Thank you.
4015000	4024000	You're welcome. I want to give you a brief talk about New York Comic Con. First thing, there was no John Woo talking about the Metroid Prime movie.
4024000	4030000	Yeah, we kind of all figured that was bullshit last week, but we had to report it. It was everywhere, so...
4030000	4040000	Yeah, because when I got there Friday or Saturday, I was with my cult panelists and we were like, let's see if we can find anything, but nothing as ever came up.
4040000	4045000	Dude, if they were going to have something, you wouldn't have had to look very hard. It would have been in neon lights.
4045000	4049000	True, true. And the big thing they were really pushing was the Iron Man movie.
4049000	4051000	Not too surprising.
4051000	4053000	Yeah, pretty much.
4053000	4055000	Maybe next year.
4055000	4068000	Yeah, it'll be pretty awesome, though. But overall, the con itself was fun. At least it was on the higher level of the Javits Center, where it was actually spread out. We could actually walk around and breathe.
4068000	4070000	Nice.
4070000	4080000	Yeah, there was a lot of people there, a lot of web comic artists that were there, and you know, Jamie, I did send you a picture, so...
4080000	4082000	I like the picture.
4082000	4086000	Yeah, and remember I told you yesterday I had another surprise for you?
4086000	4091000	Yes, you called when I was at a place buying the comics cheap.
4091000	4094000	Check your PM box. That's my birthday gift to you.
4094000	4095000	Okay...
4095000	4098000	Would you slowly describe this for our listeners as she opens it up?
4098000	4108000	Well, if you're a fan of a certain webcomic called VGCats, I spoke to Scott and asked him to do a nice little drawing of our very own Jamie.
4108000	4110000	Oh...
4110000	4114000	So you actually got the guy who draws VGCats to draw a picture of Jamie.
4114000	4116000	That's cute!
4116000	4118000	Yeah, he showed it to me before the show.
4118000	4120000	Oh my god, that's so cute!
4120000	4122000	So, very cool.
4122000	4123000	Yay! Thank you!
4123000	4127000	Why couldn't you get the rest of us, huh? No, I'm just kidding. No, I think that's great.
4127000	4129000	VGCats is like my favorite webcomic right now.
4129000	4135000	No, you know what's funny? He actually calls how she says right now, but it might change.
4135000	4136000	It's been for a while.
4136000	4138000	Depending on what bribes other webcomics send her.
4138000	4146000	He called me, I guess, like Friday, I think he called me, because he wanted me to send a picture of you to have this model.
4146000	4150000	But the problem was, because I was in Mendocino, I had no cell phone access, I didn't get the message till today.
4150000	4153000	But you must have gotten on MySpace or something, you found a picture somehow.
4153000	4156000	He's got the picture from us at E3.
4156000	4158000	Yeah, I noticed. That's awesome.
4158000	4164000	Well, it wasn't me that got the picture. You can ask. You can thank Gio of Dia. She picked out the picture for me to take over there.
4164000	4166000	Nice. Well, there you have it.
4166000	4171000	So that's the guy who does VGCats, Drew Jamie. That's awesome.
4171000	4172000	Yay!
4172000	4173000	Pretty cool.
4173000	4176000	Oh, that's so cool. I'm going to have to write a thank you, too.
4176000	4180000	But thank you so much. I appreciate that. That's like the best thing ever.
4180000	4182000	Well, we should just invite him on the damn show.
4182000	4185000	I'd like to. They were our website of the week once.
4185000	4188000	We'll work on that. We'll work it out.
4188000	4189000	That's so cute.
4189000	4191000	Well, Rama, thank you so much. That was very nice of you to do.
4191000	4195000	And the whole chat room is fawning over it right now, so there you go.
4195000	4200000	You notice how it just looks like Jamie if you think about it. Just her normal attitude, per se.
4200000	4205000	Yeah, it's cool. Except now I'm going to make her wear cat ears just to compare.
4205000	4209000	I have several cat eared hats. Thank you, Rob.
4209000	4214000	All right. Anything else you want to share with our chatters today, Rama, and our listeners?
4214000	4218000	Well, that's pretty much it. I just wanted to get that across. That was it.
4218000	4220000	Well, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
4220000	4221000	Sure. No problem. Anytime.
4221000	4226000	You make Jamie's birthday last all weekend long. I'm sure she can't complain.
4226000	4228000	Yes. Oh, and Jamie?
4228000	4229000	Uh-huh.
4229000	4233000	She wants to know, where did you get the gelato from? The Guinness Gelato?
4233000	4234000	Naya.
4234000	4235000	Okay.
4235000	4244000	I've only seen Naya in California, so I don't know if it's all over the place, but they have different flavors that circulate.
4244000	4255000	They also had champagne gelato. They also had mojito and Captain Morgan gelato.
4255000	4257000	I like that one.
4257000	4263000	But the Guinness Gelato is freaking good. And they usually have Nutella.
4263000	4268000	But if ever you find a Naya and they have whole wheat gelato, try it. It tastes like cereal.
4268000	4270000	Definitely.
4270000	4277000	Amanda in chat says they're Bay Area. I think they only have six stores. And if that's the Amanda I'm thinking it is, then hi.
4277000	4279000	There you go. They're Bay Area only.
4279000	4281000	Yeah. They're really good, though.
4281000	4283000	It's not Pinkberry. I'm sorry.
4283000	4284000	All right.
4284000	4285000	We just got...
4285000	4287000	We're going to let you go, Rama. Take care.
4287000	4288000	I'll try.
4288000	4289000	Bye.
4289000	4291000	I'll catch up to you guys later.
4291000	4296000	1877 game. Oh, dang. I just hung up and, boop, here comes another call.
4296000	4298000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
4298000	4299000	GS68.
4299000	4301000	Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?
4301000	4305000	First of all, I'm happy 4.28 to everyone who celebrates it.
4305000	4307000	Happy 4.20, dude.
4307000	4311000	Where's our Zaku call? You know we need a Zaku call on 4.20.
4311000	4312000	He's celebrating.
4312000	4314000	All right. What's up, GS68?
4314000	4334000	Anyways, this week was the one year anniversary of the V Team Massacre, and I just want to say one thing to everyone who immediately pinned the blame on video games, especially people who didn't even have any resources or citations for that.
4334000	4336000	Such as Lord Voldemort?
4336000	4348000	Yes. I mean, why did he go up to the killers, the family, and say all that to their faces?
4348000	4362000	I dare you. I dare you to go up to his parents, his siblings, if he has any, their faces, and start talking about how his son was influenced by video games and all that.
4362000	4381000	At the same time, though, I think this whole week of memory and everything is sort of to just kind of, you know, I think we have to kind of let those bitter feelings just kind of go right now and try to look back and just kind of remember those that lost their lives and what was just a senseless and horrible thing and tragedy.
4381000	4389000	So at the same time, it's kind of like, let's just not draw the pain out any longer, you know what I mean?
4389000	4400000	But, you know, I understand. It was kind of stupid for some of those people to be blaming video games in the first place, and it's just kind of sad that it keeps going on throughout all these tragic events that happened.
4400000	4405000	And the call dropped. We lost them. Was that bandwidth? Is the network still going?
4405000	4406000	I'm still on.
4406000	4420000	All right. Well, we lost them. But, yeah, and of course, you know what's interesting? I have a friend that's actually going to be going to Virginia Tech next year, so, you know, I'm just, I know this is probably a difficult time.
4420000	4426000	I know we have listeners out there, too, so I know it was probably a difficult week, and, you know, our thoughts are with you guys.
4426000	4431000	And definitely, let's just try and get past it.
4431000	4436000	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4436000	4442000	While we wait for some calls to drop in, do we have any quick last minute stories, by chance? Anything last minute?
4442000	4443000	Yes.
4443000	4446000	All right. What would you like to share?
4446000	4461000	I'm just going to suggest, or, Blitz League was one of the games that they announced at Midway's Gamers' Day that's getting a sequel, same as Game Party, apparently both of those games getting sequels.
4461000	4462000	Game Party?
4462000	4467000	Game Party. That was the one that had beer pong in it, but they called it something else, Pinkup.
4467000	4469000	That's what they were calling it instead of beer pong.
4469000	4476000	Right. Oh, we got another call. Let's go take it real quick. I'm curious to know more about this, though. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
4476000	4478000	Hello, this is RossDioUT.
4478000	4481000	Hello, RossDioUT. What is on your mind?
4481000	4491000	A little bit. Before I go into that, I would like to thank DMN for being an asshole and a grief friend banning me from the chat. That leaves me with time to play games while I'm listening. Very nice.
4491000	4503000	I'm not even going to go there. I don't know what the heck's going on. Sometimes I feel not in control of our own chat room, but we'll try to get that sorted out. What else is on your mind, though, buddy?
4503000	4528000	I don't know if you saw this, but recently the Vendee had a really creative promotion for their upcoming Ghostbusters game. They actually restored the old Ectomobile, you know, the car from the movie, and they parked it at a Best Buy in Minnesota for promotional purposes.
4528000	4538000	They actually have a picture on Kotaku I'd link to the chat, but, you know. They did a bang-up job on it. It's very nice.
4538000	4547000	I didn't see the car, but I saw the box art for the game, which I found to be half-appropriate and half-boring. Did you see the box art that was posted?
4547000	4548000	I think this is temporary.
4548000	4551000	It is just one of those placeholder things for people who want to pre-order the game.
4551000	4553000	It's a ways off before the game comes out.
4553000	4565000	I would have just expected to see some more brouhaha about, because isn't the script actually by Bill Murray and them? The script for the game is by the people who did the movie. I'm sorry, not Bill Murray, but Harold Ramis and the people who did the original.
4565000	4569000	I would expect more fanfare over that.
4569000	4583000	Well, like you said, I think they want to keep to the feel of the original. I remember the original VHS covers had just the logo, which, you know, kind of fits since that's what it's about.
4583000	4584000	That was 20 years ago.
4584000	4585000	I'm sorry?
4585000	4589000	That was 20 years ago. Things were different back then, you know what I mean?
4589000	4592000	Well, there is something to be said about nostalgia, you know?
4592000	4594000	I guess that's true.
4594000	4600000	I'll give you that, but that huge old Xbox 360 banner in white kind of ruins it, you know what I mean?
4600000	4604000	And same thing with the PlayStation. Well, at least the PlayStation 3 thing is black, but you know what I mean?
4604000	4609000	Those mandatory banners they have to have on there kind of ruin that all black box, you know what I mean?
4609000	4610000	Yeah.
4610000	4619000	I think that's honestly what it is for me, is that, you know, having those other little streaks in it ruined the thing.
4619000	4621000	But anyway, it's just box art. I'll get over it.
4621000	4623000	If the game's good, it can be fantastic.
4623000	4631000	I don't know about you, I throw the boxes away because I have like hundreds of games and I really don't have the space for all those big ass boxes.
4631000	4635000	You know, I just put them in jewel cases myself. I don't know what you guys do.
4635000	4640000	I do leave them in the case, but the cases are all on a shelf. They're on a DVD rack type thing that's pretty big.
4640000	4645000	So like I have my Wii games on one rack, Xbox 360 on another rack, so it works.
4645000	4650000	I don't own as many games as one might think.
4650000	4657000	I certainly don't own as many games as Jamie does, who has to have an entire like wall in her house with nothing but bookshelves that have the games.
4657000	4669000	I will tell you what we do, is that for the systems that we have out most often, being our Xbox 360, the Wii and the PS3, and the Saturn is out right now too, I think.
4669000	4675000	What we do is we usually keep out the games that we're playing the most and we have a small rack that stays in the front room.
4675000	4682000	We've got actually these large bookshelves in the computer room that's basically also in my room, because I'm on the computer in there.
4682000	4686000	But we keep them with our movies, with our DVDs.
4686000	4694000	And the special edition boxes, we will every so often have them on display for the newer ones, but right now they're all in the vault.
4694000	4698000	They don't make gaming organizers quite like they used to either.
4698000	4703000	I had a pretty badass one for the Atari 2600 that was like a little drawer and you'd hit the button and the drawer would pop out.
4703000	4707000	And then you'd hit another button and the game would kind of pop out.
4707000	4711000	I mean, it was just cheap plastic with levers, but the way it worked was pretty awesome.
4711000	4712000	I don't know.
4712000	4713000	I liked the...
4713000	4714000	Oh, I'm sorry.
4714000	4723000	Well, the Atari 5200 had its little storage compartment in the back for controllers in a couple of games, built into the system.
4723000	4728000	Yeah, Nintendo actually had something similar to that for the Super Nintendo for the N64.
4728000	4732000	They had like these game houses. I have a couple of them. They're very nice.
4732000	4735000	I remember that for the Super Nintendo.
4735000	4736000	That's true.
4736000	4742000	And then what do we get? We get a Wii thing that was supposed to have a chip holder in it that ends up getting cancelled.
4742000	4743000	I know.
4743000	4749000	Anyway, sorry. I derailed your original topic of the Ghostbusters thing. Is there anything else you wanted to say on that or anything else you wanted to talk about tonight?
4749000	4764000	I don't know. That was just about it, except that people asked her if that's about it. It would take too much to bring up something else.
4764000	4765000	I'll do that in an email next week.
4765000	4767000	Anyways, it was good to talk to you guys.
4767000	4769000	It's always best to take the high road, Ross Steel.
4769000	4771000	All right, have a good one, buddy.
4771000	4772000	Have a good one, bro.
4772000	4773000	Take care.
4773000	4780000	1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Oh, we've got to take at least one more call.
4780000	4783000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
4783000	4785000	Legend of Zaku.
4785000	4788000	Happy 420, Legend of Zaku.
4788000	4794000	I don't smoke weed for the record. I just say this to all the people that celebrate the consumption of cannabis.
4794000	4798000	I've got to give you a hard time, Zaku, because you've got to admit it.
4798000	4804000	I don't know if it's just your microphone or the environment you call us in if you're calling us from a tin can or something.
4804000	4807000	Tin can? Where's the string, though?
4807000	4813000	You always sound a little bit high, but that's all right. We're equal opportunity entertainers here at OrangeLoungeRadio.
4813000	4816000	To what do we owe this great phone call tonight?
4816000	4831000	Let me see. Basically, it's like this. Recently, last Friday, I went out with this girl, and we happened to stop by Dave & Buster's on our date.
4831000	4845000	I was just wondering. I know I don't want to dig up DDR as much, but suppose the date of yours basically never played DDR, and if she did, it was really horrible.
4845000	4850000	What songs would you even recommend in order for both of us to play?
4850000	4857000	I would say fuck it and take her over to Jumpin' Jackpot, because that's where you're really going to get some pussy is Jumpin' Jackpot.
4857000	4859000	Oh, wow.
4859000	4863000	Would you agree, DarkSakura?
4863000	4867000	What turns you on more, DDR or Jumpin' Jackpot?
4867000	4868000	DDR.
4868000	4877000	All right. You know what? Here's the thing. If the girl doesn't like DDR, is it that she doesn't like DDR or that she's just not good at it, so it kind of turns her off?
4877000	4888000	She's not good. She dislikes it for the fact that she can't really use both of her legs effectively.
4888000	4899000	Two guaranteed ways to get somebody who's not into DDR, girl, boy, or not, two guaranteed ways to get them into it is that A, you pick easy songs, one-foot songs.
4899000	4902000	I did. I had her on Beginners.
4902000	4909000	All right. Good. Good. That's where you got to start. And then the other one would be to pick recognizable songs. You got to pick the Britney Spears song.
4909000	4917000	It kind of depends on what kind of music she's into, but you got to realize your date's not going to recognize Smile DK. They're not going to know.
4917000	4922000	It was on a Supernova 2. All right. I get your point there.
4922000	4943000	Yeah. You got to pick something recognizable, but after you get past the recognizable song, then you can pick something catchy because I don't know about the rest of you guys, but one thing I remember about my very first game of DDR I ever played on a DDR 1.5 mix, that song Butterfly was damn catchy, and that song was in my head for three days after playing DDR.
4943000	4952000	I was just kind of going around going, I'm your little butterfly, and I could not get that freaking song out of my head. So it's okay to pick catchy stuff.
4952000	4961000	But you got to kind of know, if she's kind of a rocker girl, Smile DK is not going to be your thing, and I don't know if DDR necessarily will be.
4961000	4964000	Remember, as I said, I was totally unprepared for the situation.
4964000	4966000	You just let her pick the song.
4966000	4972000	Well, that's the thing. She said she didn't care.
4972000	4974000	Typical woman response.
4974000	4979000	I don't care, but I will criticize you when you choose the wrong thing.
4979000	4983000	As an official woman, I can...
4983000	4987000	Oh, official. Yes, she has the woman seal of approval on her buttocks.
4987000	4991000	No, I have it on my chest. Thank you.
4991000	5008000	If a girl tells you, I don't care, it either means that no, she really doesn't care, but once she hears it, she's probably not going to like it. So I would just say, pick one, pick the other, and ask her which one sounds better.
5008000	5010000	Don't leave it open.
5010000	5017000	Yeah, I kind of, as I said, I kind of needed that advice, you know, the quick spur of the moment thing.
5017000	5022000	Hopefully I'll try it again if I, you know, once I go out with her again.
5022000	5033000	My buddy Amanda in chat says, reminds me, and she's an official woman too, she says, the way Rob got me to play it was, quote, Amanda, it's like a rave, but a game, because she was a big raver back then.
5033000	5037000	And I was like, it's like a rave, but a game, because there's flashing lights.
5037000	5041000	It's like cross stitching, but a game.
5041000	5047000	Well, Zaku, best of luck to you on future dates, and we hope you get some, alright? Good luck.
5047000	5048000	Yeah.
5048000	5050000	Take care, buddy.
5050000	5055000	Did you hear that? Yeah, it was kind of like, yeah, me too.
5055000	5062000	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. If you missed us tonight, sorry, maybe you can leave us a voicemail on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5062000	5070000	Don't forget about our contest going on too, you're going to check that out as we are going on throughout the week and looking for contest entries.
5070000	5075000	So, more last minute stories from Loki. We had the story about Blitz, the League, and Beer Pong getting a sequel.
5075000	5077000	It's not Beer Pong, it's a game called-
5077000	5079000	But that's the part we care about.
5079000	5085000	Game Party, and it had Beer Pong in it, and Shuffleboard and some other shit.
5085000	5089000	It was a cheap ass game. One of those maybe shovelware games or whatever.
5089000	5100000	Anyways, real quick, the Burnout Paradise Cagney update that was going to be coming out, actually from what I read now, it's out now.
5100000	5107000	So if you pop in your copy of Burnout, you'll get your new portions of the map, which I will have to try when I get home.
5107000	5116000	And it's also going to include three more online modes, Road Rage, Markman, and Stunt Run are going to be available online as well now.
5116000	5121000	For PS3 owners, you will also be getting the option for custom soundtracks.
5121000	5123000	So that's pretty nice.
5123000	5133000	Something kind of disappointing, that game Boom Blocks that was supposedly going to have that head tracking kind of easter egg.
5133000	5139000	Well, they removed head tracking, so no reason to buy that game now.
5139000	5145000	But at the same time, you can't yell, get out of my head, to this video game anymore, I guess.
5145000	5152000	Let's see here, apparently an Xbox 360 power supply was blamed for a fire. That's kind of funny.
5152000	5154000	Xbox Live is going to be down tomorrow.
5154000	5157000	Not if it's your house that burned down, that's not funny.
5157000	5159000	But it wasn't, so it's funny.
5159000	5170000	Xbox Live is going to be down tomorrow from two, or I guess tonight, two in the morning to ten tomorrow Pacific time, just for some spring cleaning maintenance.
5170000	5177000	Let's see here, also there's some interesting things.
5177000	5190000	You might know this guy, Ricky Gervais, he's the guy that's in the office in the UK.
5190000	5199000	He's actually going to be kind of having a cameo in Grand Theft Auto IV as part of the city's stand-up comedy club.
5199000	5203000	This is a three-minute act that will, I guess, loop or whatever.
5203000	5209000	They'll have different people going on stage, but I think that's kind of cool that they have real comedians doing acts in the game.
5209000	5211000	So, a little bit of immersion there.
5211000	5212000	Interesting.
5212000	5222000	Let's see here, also, apparently Halo Wars is coming along pretty well.
5222000	5232000	There's been a few people that are part of the Xbox 360 launch team that have been caught playing Halo Wars Alpha online.
5232000	5235000	Saw you, caught you.
5235000	5237000	So that's interesting.
5237000	5241000	Then, let's see here.
5241000	5247000	Apparently, I think you may have talked about this before, virtual console games.
5247000	5249000	People have found ways to pirate those now.
5249000	5252000	That's kind of interesting.
5252000	5262000	They found ways to strip away, I guess, all of the encryption on them, and now a team called Blaze is releasing them out on the internet right now.
5262000	5273000	They have a few of them, and using a tool put out by yet someone else, you can actually install them to your system using the Twilight Princess hack.
5273000	5278000	So that's, I guess, no one's perfect as far as security goes.
5278000	5289000	What's interesting, though, also is that the UK version of the internet channel has also been leaked out using that method as well.
5289000	5293000	So that means that WiiWare isn't immune to it either.
5293000	5294000	Uh oh.
5294000	5299000	Uh oh.
5299000	5302000	But if Nintendo catches you, you will get the wrath upon you.
5302000	5303000	Yes.
5303000	5306000	Apparently, there's no plans for Gears of War 2.
5306000	5310000	I just want to say, that's the problem with posting these methods on the internet is that Nintendo will patch it.
5310000	5311000	Yeah.
5311000	5315000	Apparently, there's not going to be a Gears of War 2 demo.
5315000	5318000	However, there have been some hints.
5318000	5329000	Mark Raine, I guess, dropping some hints that Unreal Tournament 3 will feature the first Gears of War 2 content tease.
5329000	5341000	And didn't say what it is, but he says, we know some of these great mods are going to be, or they're talking about the mods, those are also going to be available for the Xbox 360 version of Unreal Tournament 3.
5341000	5348000	But people are thinking maybe that they're going to have either a demo on Unreal Tournament 3, or there's just going to be some new video footage of the game.
5348000	5350000	So I guess that's pretty cool.
5350000	5354000	And let's see here.
5354000	5363000	I think that's pretty much it.
5363000	5372000	Oh, there's been a lot of homebrew stuff made for the Wii as well, including now they have SNES emulators with classic controller support.
5372000	5379000	Genesis Sega CD emulators, Master System Game Gear emulators for the Wii, PC Engine emulators.
5379000	5388000	They have the Rin Game Boy channel for the Wii, Emuloader, which will do some other emulators, and Wii Paint, which might be fun.
5388000	5391000	They need a Mario Paint for the Wii. That'd be fun.
5391000	5392000	But that's it.
5392000	5394000	Wowies, lots of last minute news.
5394000	5399000	I thought, I was thinking going into this week after I'd been gone, I was like, oh, it's a slow gaming week, but no, lots of news.
5399000	5401000	Lots of good stuff.
5401000	5406000	All right, well that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio, but not before we get everybody's final thoughts.
5406000	5408000	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5408000	5410000	I should have ordered this earlier.
5410000	5411000	What is it?
5411000	5413000	Tickets for Phantom of the Opera.
5413000	5414000	Oh, nice.
5414000	5415000	I want to go.
5415000	5416000	It sounds like fun.
5416000	5420000	Loki, if I go, I have to take my mother.
5420000	5424000	This is going to sound so gay, but I don't care.
5424000	5430000	Going to a musical theater is something I have to do with my mom, because she's such a fan.
5430000	5433000	When Mama Mia comes to town, she's like, we got to go.
5433000	5440000	Loki, your final thought. I will not be seeing Phantom this year since I've seen it the last two times it's been in town, and I really don't need to see it a third time.
5440000	5445000	My final thought is Sweeney Todd is going to be in town this year, and that's one I want to see.
5445000	5447000	So that's probably the one I'll buy my mom tickets for.
5447000	5448000	That might be cool.
5448000	5453000	Because if I'm going to go to musical theater, I'm going to take her to a violent play and see what she thinks of that.
5453000	5454000	Awesome.
5454000	5457000	I like your mom, and we need to call her on the show.
5457000	5459000	Mother's Day is just around the corner.
5459000	5463000	Rob, we need to figure out what we're going to do for our Justin TV deal.
5463000	5467000	I know. There is a Justin TV special thingy in the works.
5467000	5469000	More OLR programming coming.
5469000	5470000	Yes.
5470000	5471000	We'll talk about it this week.
5471000	5479000	I like asking questions like that, because it teases it and makes the chat room go, WTF, must listen, or watch, or stuff.
5479000	5481000	There you go. More to come on that soon.
5481000	5487000	But in the meantime, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting us or listening to us live as it may be on AllGames.com.
5487000	5488000	We really appreciate it.
5488000	5489000	Join us again on Sunday nights.
5489000	5491000	Remember, if you like what you hear, we do this show for free.
5491000	5493000	Please tell two friends about our show.
5493000	5497000	It's a way to help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.
5497000	5498000	And send cash.
5498000	5500000	No, we don't ask for your cash.
5500000	5503000	But we do ask for five-star iTunes reviews.
5503000	5504000	But I personally ask for their cash.
5504000	5506000	You don't always get it, though.
5506000	5508000	Just like Loki's not going to get that Xbox 360.
5508000	5509000	I got sent.
5509000	5512000	I've got $3 exactly for listeners.
5512000	5514000	I forgot to mention this as part of the last minute story.
5514000	5516000	I did have a listener buy me dinner.
5516000	5517000	So I guess that was kind of cool.
5517000	5519000	I was sent a dollar by a listener in Boston.
5519000	5522000	And then I got sent a $2 bill.
5522000	5523000	And a bunch of Doctor Who fanzines.
5523000	5527000	Real quick, I thought that I'd add this in there because I forgot to mention this during last minute stories.
5527000	5528000	What's that?
5528000	5533000	Apparently, Peekaboo, a company that specializes in a temporary at-home stripper pole, is working on...
5533000	5535000	Oh, no.
5535000	5544000	Yes, yes, including one that's endorsed by Karma Electra, is announced this week that they are developing a strip aerobic scheme for the Wii.
5544000	5554000	So Peekaboo is pleased to confirm that it's in talks to develop a game for the Wii that meets mainstream demand for fun and fitness benefits of pole dancing.
5554000	5556000	The company said in an email...
5556000	5557000	This has to be a joke.
5557000	5558000	No.
5558000	5559000	This has to be a joke.
5559000	5568000	Peekaboo and its partners are focused on using Wii-friendly hardware to make aerobic pole dancing instantly accessible, just as Guitar Hero did for Rock and Roll.
5568000	5576000	Actually, actually, I have to say that there are some fitness places that offer pole dancing as an exercise.
5576000	5578000	I know you think this is a joke, but this is on ABC News.
5578000	5584000	No, I fully believe it because I've seen advertisements for pole dancing classes.
5584000	5585000	That's awesome.
5585000	5587000	What can I say?
5587000	5591000	It's just more of the randomness you've come to expect and love from Orange Lounge Radio.
5591000	5595000	And we'll do it all again next week, same time, same place.
5595000	5598000	Until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki.
