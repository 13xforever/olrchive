5894	14742	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15443	19086	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19847	21809	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21829	29315	We are live on this Sunday evening, April 20th, 2008, with episode number 276 of our show.
29375	32317	We are live on allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 p.m.
32377	35319	Pacific, immediately following the Bobby Blackwolf show.
36420	38962	So come join us for live taping if you've never been here before.
39002	42565	I do know we have some new faces in our chat, so thanks so much to all the guys in chat.
42885	47269	I think as we are making our presence more known on allgames.com and people are realizing...
47509	47889	Thanks for watching!
67785	68965	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
92072	96697	There's kind of a wonder what the hell is the download content going to be?
97238	110232	Well, according to CVG's recent Grand Theft Auto 4 Collector's Edition magazine, the Xbox 360 download content could be whole new cities.
111243	130131	They were saying, of course, to call games as vastly ambitious as Vice City and San Andreas mere expansion packs seems childish, but nevertheless, the downloadable content DLC coming from the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto 4 has repositioned those games in just this way.
130511	135534	Downloadable content so far has meant the odd new car, jumper of a bit...
137975	161435	But Grand Theft Auto 4 is set to completely redefine the idea of expansions with Grand Theft Auto 4 What Vice City or San Andreas were to Grand Theft Auto 3 Yes, Rockstar is clearly hinting at new downloadable cities And chances of them being London, Vice City, or San Andreas are slim to none So that's new as brand new
162136	165158	Grand Theft Auto 4's Liberty City is just the beginning.
165618	167540	Think about that and get excited.
168901	173404	So, since this new Grand Theft Auto game is supposed to be a parody of New York City, right?
173724	175985	Are we going to get Upstate New York as the expansions?
176406	177106	Maybe, you know?
177306	178287	Or Jersey?
178827	179388	Grand Theft Jersey?
179408	185552	I don't think they're going to just replace, say, Vice City or something like that with downloadable content.
185712	187013	Grand Theft Auto Poughkeepsie?
187333	209334	I think we could see additions to the game because obviously they can only fit so much on that disc so if I could see expansions to the current city like you know outskirts type stuff but I don't know about like you know Grand Theft Auto London like you'd be able to fly to another city or something like that from the airport but that'd be pretty cool if you could I don't know you never know
210616	214199	What about just being able to cross through the tunnel and you go into Grand Theft Auto Jersey?
214660	220225	And the Xbox comes with a new attachment that will make your entire house smell like New Jersey.
221427	222027	Kidding!
222107	223208	I love Jersey.
223469	224209	Love you guys.
225697	230642	Grand Theft Auto Newark, Grand Theft Auto Mount Vernon.
230662	231583	What are your thoughts, Loki?
231603	233305	Do you think there's any possible legitimacy to this?
233325	233365	Um...
245117	256620	I don't think it's going to be as ambitious as, say, a brand new city, but I think that they will add portions of the map or add new stuff as far as... Maybe new islands?
256801	257421	Maybe little things?
257441	263222	Because originally they said it was going to be episodic content, so I could see new missions or something like that for the game.
263623	266363	I don't know about whole new portions of the map.
266443	267304	That would be kind of...
268624	268904	Big.
269464	270004	Very ambitious.
270024	280046	And I don't know why they would, you know, I mean, I guess $50 million is a lot of money, you know, to convince them to make these things exclusively for the Xbox 360 version.
280106	280427	You're right.
280767	281887	$15 million is a lot of money.
282047	290189	And I would think also if that were going to be the case, like they were getting full downloadable islands and stuff like that, wouldn't Microsoft be going, hey, guess what?
290209	291809	They're going to get full downloadable cities.
292189	292929	Buy our version.
293189	293629	Hey, wait a minute.
293649	293869	I got it.
294029	296550	If Grand Theft Auto is getting downloadable islands from New York,
297150	298871	Grand Theft Auto, Fire Island
319665	324907	Travis Donovan live, you know, our buddy who was on Orange Lounge Radio Saturday nights on the old stream of this.
325267	326528	He is coming to all games.
326648	327328	We know that much.
327808	330850	I don't know details yet, but we know he is making the move to all games.
331190	338333	And so collectively with us moving and Travis moving and Bobby already being there and all the other shows and now there's a new show.
338733	342614	Wasn't Travis Donovan going to be doing something with DMN anyways?
342754	346356	Yeah, well, I think the new show is then partnered up, but I don't know.
346756	347056	Secret.
347096	347837	I don't know the details yet.
348217	353120	Anyhow, we refer to it as the Voltron of podcasting, right?
353160	354540	The Voltron of gaming podcasting.
354800	357582	And ironically enough, what came to Xbox Live Marketplace this week?
357942	358482	Voltron.
359143	364566	And Voltron has a free episode available on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
364586	366026	You kind of have to dig for it, but it's there.
366547	368308	There's a free episode of Voltron available.
368628	370369	I know you like free stuff, so go check that out.
371109	371609	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
395734	400857	Exactly, and that's exactly why they need to give me the Grand Theft Auto 4 Elite console.
401357	403498	I don't know any nicer way to say this to you.
403538	406420	You're ineligible, and you're not going to ever be eligible.
406760	412023	And if you fucking try to enter this in a fake name or something, you will be caught, and you will be made fun of.
413283	414004	I will not.
414564	419247	By the way, if you haven't heard, we're giving away an Xbox 360 Elite with the rest of allgames.com.
419547	421848	Details are in part A. We'll give you more details next week.
422649	424249	Meanwhile, let's move on with the gaming news.
424329	425030	Past Voltron.
426633	439114	It looks like that EA is going to be releasing Rock Band on PS3, PS2, and Wii in Europe for... Wow, did that just shock you into dropping your water?
440040	442802	I guess I was so shocked I actually just dropped my water.
442982	444062	No, I'm just a klutz.
444283	446744	It'll be coming out on August 29th.
446924	455689	That means that basically Xbox 360 is going to go, well, crap, we're not the only ones anymore over there.
455909	457010	Crap, crap, crap, crap.
458438	462541	No one will care because Saints Row 2 will come out around the same time and that game is far superior.
475826	478407	I can't stop them from doing that.
478467	487054	I mean, if they win it and they decide they're going to give it to you as a Christmas present, but I tell you what, you owe them the Tingle outfit if they do that for you.
487094	489376	You fucking owe it to them to do the Tingle outfit.
489676	490416	Bet be damned.
490697	495320	If one of these people wins the Xbox for you, you owe it to society to do the Tingle outfit.
495740	496241	You wish.
497648	500290	I think that if they were... I'm trying to get around this roundabout way.
500590	504133	I deserve that system because I love Grand Theft Auto that much.
504513	505874	But do you love Tingle that much?
506174	507115	I don't love Tingle that much.
507255	507835	And you know what?
507855	509016	They should give it to me.
509156	510977	They have 500 other systems.
511117	515120	Why the fuck are they being so stingy with them?
515160	517282	And Misty sums up my thoughts exactly in chat.
517302	518222	She says, fuck that.
518262	518763	Give it to me.
519700	521361	That's what I was just sitting over here saying.
521401	523003	Give it to me if you're going to give it to somebody.
523483	524624	It has to go in the collection.
524644	526485	You don't play Grand Theft Auto.
526906	527246	I have.
527987	528647	You have.
528807	533251	She wants to suck it into her board collective of gaming crap that is her house.
533271	534692	It has to become part of the vault.
537190	540792	And people think I'm joking when I call it the vault, but no.
541153	542273	Dan calls it the vault.
542394	543714	Everybody calls it the vault.
545456	546476	We need that for the vault.
547637	549398	I did enter a contest.
549418	550839	I was going to talk about this a little later.
550919	552660	But, you know, with that...
554042	555823	Rockstar Social Club Grand Theft Auto Cover
574090	577833	See, this is the type of person that does not appreciate a Grand Theft Auto 4 Elite System.
577953	579414	Alright, get past it, people.
579454	580035	Get past it.
580435	582297	Alright, do we finish with the Rock Band news?
583237	586000	I apologize, I got derailed by the... Actually, there's one more bit about that.
586020	586340	What's that?
586880	588682	I just thought that it might be interesting that...
593427	596168	The Ferret can't fucking win that system either, just for the record.
596228	597448	Neither can any of his family.
598248	604949	Which, by the way, I would like to know if there is still another Ferret attached to a Katamari somewhere in Namco's headquarters.
605209	605530	You know what?
605590	609670	I got a pretty sizable present for Amazon for my birthday.
610090	612911	I might order another Ferret if they still own Amazon.
613111	613471	Lordy.
613911	616752	That's the last thing we need on OLR is for the Ferrets to mate.
617785	618665	We need mini ferrets.
618685	619706	Many mini ferrets.
641496	646198	Splinter Cell Chaos Theory and Metal Arms are coming to Xbox Live Originals.
646958	651560	You can get both of those games available for 1,200 Microsoft points.
652260	656322	They're going to be on there actually tomorrow or Monday.
657242	660263	And yeah, that's pretty awesome.
660283	662944	They're going to be available everywhere except for Korea and Japan.
663764	667946	No Splinter Cell Chaos Theory for Korea or Japan.
670236	672318	I'm sorry to derail the show again, but I have to.
672378	674840	Jamie, you have to check out the link I just posted in chat.
675881	677962	I typed Scoozy, which is the name of the little pet.
678002	682586	I typed it into Google, and the first thing that came up was a real ferret versus a Scoozy.
683207	686529	And there's some really cute pictures in here of the ferret cuddling up with the Scoozy.
687470	689311	So you have to check that out.
689371	691812	And then it looks like he's trying to eat it in one of those pictures.
692212	695414	I like that one because it looks like the ferret has the scoozie on his head.
695854	698175	And it reminds me of the bunny with the pancake on its head.
698955	699776	Oh, I love it.
699896	701116	It's so cute.
702137	703677	Rob, I want a ferret, okay?
705578	707519	And look at the little thingies on the ferret.
707659	711421	Oh, we have an update from BlackWolf about Loki's eligibility for the contest.
711981	713502	Here's the official word from...
714901	728065	LordBobbyBlackWolf I think that's his official title over at AllGames.com He's LordBobbyBlackWolf He says, maybe I'll let Loki enter the contest if he wears a Tingle costume to the next two OLRs and sit on the cam the entire time, no hiding No!
729626	732327	That is not acceptable You dare say no to LordBobby?
732367	736268	Do not belittle my Grand Theft Auto fanboyism, okay?
739053	740554	I know he's going to try and do it too.
740574	743977	He's going to try to enter as somebody else or send it to his friend.
744337	746279	See, that's where you forget.
746559	750703	I am more lazy than you will ever believe.
750863	754446	So do I really have time to make something and send it in?
754566	754906	No.
754986	755207	All right.
755267	755587	I'm sorry.
755647	755907	All right.
756027	757729	Look, back to gaming news.
757789	758709	We got to get past this.
759350	760711	Mailbag is coming up as well.
760751	764214	If you have emails to send in, mailbag at orange launch radio dot com.
764654	764975	All right.
766030	768572	This is a cool sounding game in name alone.
768632	770193	It's Afro Samurai.
770834	774717	You might notice an animated series that has Samuel L. Jackson doing some voices in it.
775157	780021	Xbox 360 and PS3 is getting a version of Afro Samurai this fall.
780501	784625	And the game will follow Afro as he is seeking revenge for the murder of his father.
785065	788668	And he is, quote, fighting to become the number one warrior.
789028	791330	The game will follow the storyline in the series.
791670	792091	And, uh...
792631	817172	You know you just want to know if Samuel L. Jackson is going to be doing the dialogue He is, so there you have it The musical score will also be done by RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan Sweet So it sounds pretty authentic If you're a fan of the show, you'll probably be a fan of the game Afro Samurai But if you hate it, then well, you probably won't want it There was actually an art book for it at Kinokuniya yesterday when I was there
818018	819059	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
844313	847434	DarkSakura is going to reach into the mailbag and pull out a favorite email of hers and read it.
848195	848555	Right now.
849935	850636	Or two or five.
850696	852156	We have actually a few.
852956	854057	First email!
854157	855077	Dun dun dun.
855117	855777	From Gerardimo.
855878	857818	It says, Hello OLR.
858078	864601	While I wasn't surprised with the story the other week about one kid shooting his friend over not getting his turn while playing a video game, I did realize this.
865041	870123	The media says that video games promote violence and it really seems like they only promote gun violence.
870623	872564	Or the media only covers gun violence.
874665	878208	Has there ever been a story about one person beating another person to death after playing Tekken?
878808	879629	I don't think so.
879969	885774	Has anybody tried to use the Calamitic Symphony on their friend when they lose in Soul Calibur?
886074	886314	No.
886794	888796	But kudos to anyone who can do that in the real world.
889576	893059	Has anyone been beat over the head with a shovel after playing Viva Pinata?
893459	893760	Nuh-uh.
894520	900925	So do you think that when people say games promote violence, do you think that they should say that they promote gun violence instead?
901266	906390	Because it seems like that is the only violent action people take and blame on games.
909533	914237	Or people should just stop blaming it singly on games and maybe consider it's the whole picture.
914537	919501	You know, when I say the whole picture, I mean all forms of movies and other types of entertainment.
919561	921623	Most importantly, when the parents aren't watching...
923348	925029	and not telling their kids what's right and wrong.
925049	927070	There's already freaking problems with the kids.
927470	931952	You know, put them in an institution since you don't want to do your damn job anyway.
932012	932932	Send them to boot camp.
933213	933773	Call Maury.
936604	940528	Next email from GS68 says, Hey Loki, hey Jamie, hey Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
941769	942009	Hi.
943470	946493	I come once again to bring up the issue of recent games being too easy.
946533	948195	Perhaps this is what gamers want.
948695	954481	I've noticed that, for example, the House of the Dead 2 and 3 Return is not getting a lot of good reception because of its limited continues.
954841	959347	Compare this to Ghost Squad, which has unlimited continues, which I don't see anyone whining about.
959527	962871	In fact, many welcome it as it allows them to never die.
963512	969219	So games may be getting easier, yes, but is this a good thing to make games less frustrating so that more can enjoy them?
969960	970220	P.S.
970240	973525	This email was brought to you by Olive Garden, the home of never-ending boots to the head.
974673	975233	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1000908	1020119	so I'm hoping there's something maybe that will come out for that a little later for those folks that are whining it's too difficult because some people some people just want to blast through it to say they blast through it but then of course I understand there's the hardcore gamers that want to say they did it and they were first too if that makes sense so well next email then sure
1021898	1024799	Dear Orange Lounge Radio, I have no gamer tag or ID.
1024879	1026820	I mainly played handhelds and the Wii.
1027280	1033082	I am fortunate that I have a job where I am required to sit and wait for action so I get through my fair share of handheld games.
1033482	1046467	I'm a big fan of listening to you for over a year now and I am a tart of a listener listening to over a dozen gaming podcasts regularly and find it interesting to see how when a story appears on one site it dissipates through the others.
1047507	1048667	Oops, that was an accident.
1048767	1049708	I didn't mean to hit the ferret.
1051008	1053291	I'm often smirky at your I wish statements.
1053331	1057877	I remember a few weeks back on one of your future wishes was a TV on your mobile.
1058538	1066167	Here in the UK, I have that for over 50 pence for 24 hour, I'm sorry, for 50 pence for a 24 hour period.
1066488	1069632	I can watch actual television or I can play monthly fee for less overall.
1070372	1072834	Covering the major terrestrial channels in MTV, etc.
1073474	1079719	Also, in this week's Part A, number 275, you mentioned, why can't I have... Can I jump in real quick about the TV on the mobile thing?
1080179	1083021	I actually do have TV on my mobile, but it sucks.
1083461	1086683	And you only get limited channels, which are practically infomercials.
1088064	1090766	It's not at the same level that it's at in other countries yet.
1090786	1093868	The technology is years behind here.
1093888	1095269	It leaves a lot to be desired.
1095669	1098451	I know, it's because people have their heads up their asses, but moving forward.
1099152	1103595	Also in this week's part A, number 275, you mentioned, why can't I have a white wave bird with Rumble?
1103935	1105316	I've had one for over six months.
1105796	1110440	One of the major gaming store chains in the UK has an unofficial one, see link below.
1110900	1120146	And that is www.game.co.uk slash we slash hardware slash accessory slash...
1121067	1131640	TildaR330970 GameWare-Wii-Wireless-GameCube-Control-Pad Just go to game.co.uk and look in the Wii section.
1132802	1136724	It works perfectly as I bought a Wave Bird for when Brawl comes out over here.
1137324	1140905	And out of the two, I prefer the white game controller as it has the rumble.
1141486	1145547	At 15 pounds, 30 pounds... My apologies.
1146207	1149189	At 13 pounds, $30 I think is very reasonable.
1149209	1151930	I'm also favoring the wheel on Mario Karts.
1152330	1156792	I'm averaging a third or fourth place online and winning all of my races offline so far.
1157452	1166318	What I've also liked was when I first went online with my Wii, I forgot to stop my PC hogging the internet and was thrown off during early setup stages.
1166718	1168780	I was automatically penalized about 40 points.
1169340	1176525	Although this hurt, I was delighted to see that if you drop off as a bad sport, it will cost you on your achievement score.
1176665	1177986	Cheers, Mark from Plymouth.
1179710	1182272	I'm glad for the penalties as well when you drop out of there.
1182292	1182692	This is funny.
1182912	1185414	This is from Plymouth, England, where the Mayflower set off.
1185714	1187516	In fact, my local pub is called the Mayflower.
1188356	1188557	Nice.
1190738	1192259	Some good perspectives from overseas.
1192299	1197083	Yeah, you have to remember sometimes the peripherals are different from one side of the pond to the other.
1198504	1201086	I didn't even think that probably Europe already has had that white.
1201346	1204548	But we had a white... No, I guess we didn't have a white wave bird before.
1204568	1205309	We had the old...
1205669	1207410	Yeah, I guess I never really had them in white.
1207690	1210811	And it's not really the color that makes a lick of difference.
1210851	1218674	It's just the fact that they're kind of having a resurgence, you know, in light of the fact that the GameCube is, for all practical purposes, a dead system over here.
1218694	1219674	They don't really make new ones.
1220094	1222975	It's nice to see that they're, you know, doing the way.
1223215	1225616	But that is interesting that you have that particular store over in the UK.
1225676	1227357	It's been supporting it the whole time.
1228077	1228757	So there you have it.
1230339	1231119	Are there more emails?
1231340	1233381	There are quite a few, actually.
1234081	1235142	And moving forward.
1236342	1244987	Hey, OLR, I'm writing this email on remote play on my PS3, and I want to let you guys know about a workaround for the internet browser password protection.
1245527	1251270	If you go into Folding at Home and go to the team stats, all you have to do is find a team whose homepage links to Google.
1251290	1255412	It says Try Google, and off you go.
1255493	1257494	Particularly helpful against tech-minded parents.
1258514	1258794	Oops!
1259574	1262915	Sincerely, PK... Is it PKJr92?
1264395	1265155	Yes, that sounds right.
1265695	1267496	I think he friended me on Myspace recently.
1267656	1268516	I like his quote.
1268536	1271096	It says, Change is inevitable except from a vending machine.
1272037	1272757	I've heard that before.
1272977	1274977	Yes, that's a good quote.
1275017	1275697	What else have I heard?
1276097	1277378	Change is inevitable... Wait, no.
1277418	1277818	What is it?
1278578	1281758	You can avoid most things except death and taxes and sometimes you can cheat death.
1281978	1282559	Something like that.
1282739	1284979	It's a similar quote in my messed up mind.
1285595	1286556	Hi, OLR!
1287376	1291779	I just wanted to comment on Jamie saying she didn't want her gaming system to perform as anything but gaming system.
1292419	1295161	I, of course, am a PSP owner, and currently that is my only system.
1295541	1302345	The reason that it is my only system is that next-gen consoles are too expensive for me right now, but I still like to play on the go, and this suits me better.
1303586	1305987	The multifunction of the PSP was a major selling point for me.
1306308	1313472	The fact that my first introduction to OLR was on the PSP fanboy site, in which they mentioned their favorite podcast, and out of all the ones listed, I tried them all.
1313552	1314312	OLR was the best.
1314352	1314913	Well, thank you.
1315413	1322637	I have the RSS feed saved on my PSP and I plug it into my car stereo and listen to each week's show during my 30 minute commute to work all week.
1323017	1325338	So in a sense, I would never have heard of Olar without my PSP.
1325438	1326038	Shocking, huh?
1326799	1329660	And yeah, my cell phone can do a lot of that crap, but it can't play a decent game.
1329780	1330941	I hope Sky is feeling better.
1331121	1332242	Viva la PSP.
1332942	1333322	P.S.
1333862	1337704	I might own a next-gen system or two if I had enough money to buy and collect pinball machines.
1337884	1338205	Haha.
1338605	1339245	That's from Circe523.
1341507	1347199	Um, and by the way, the pinball machines came about because my husband got hit by a car when he was 13.
1348121	1349203	Got run over by a truck.
1349925	1351969	We get a little bit of money every five years.
1353066	1353786	I noticed it's like buying a house.
1353806	1356107	He'll buy a fixer-upper and then fix it and then sell it for more than it was before.
1356127	1360987	It also doesn't help that he has worked as managers at a couple different video game stores.
1361007	1361107	Right.
1380131	1383774	We've looked into all that, and all of our old stuff, we've gone to flea markets.
1383794	1401329	Well, you know, as far as the PSP goes, I still appreciate it for being the multi-system that it is, doing everything it does, and you kind of give an example of that, is a lot of people use a PSP as kind of like their, not quite iPod, but, you know, MP3 playing device as it is.
1401409	1404672	One of my coworkers uses his for that, just about only.
1404852	1407154	And hey, it plays games and serves the net too, so why not?
1407674	1407814	So...
1409475	1415536	Yeah, you know, and especially after kind of really only having a PSP while I was on vacation this weekend, those things can really do quite a bit.
1416576	1417036	I enjoy it.
1417197	1418337	And those screens are so pretty.
1418397	1419297	I just can't stop saying it.
1419677	1423598	Somebody, by the way, in our forums wants to create an OLR theme for the PSP.
1423638	1427318	And I think there was kind of one on the OLR PSP site, but I think they want one updated.
1427498	1431979	Well, that's just a wallpaper that we have on our site.
1432219	1433179	They're talking about an actual theme.
1433299	1436620	I thought about doing it, but then again, once again, going back to how lazy I am.
1437841	1439402	Well, hopefully the listeners will actually finish it.
1440022	1444545	But I saw that going on on the forums, so that'll be fun because you can pimp out your PSP with OLR propaganda.
1445125	1445786	That's always fun.
1446755	1447395	That is.
1449456	1460239	And on top of that, I think that what I had clarified my statement in adding is that if what you want it for is the multiple use, that's fine, but it's not a selling point for me.
1460919	1465181	You know, I would rather have a system that's got more fun games on it, I think.
1465301	1467501	You're just looking games to games.
1468041	1469422	I think it's kind of what I pick up from you.
1469442	1470522	You're looking at games to games.
1470542	1472803	When you look at games on the DS, you're like, that's where it's at for me.
1473308	1477709	PSP is primarily a gaming system.
1478730	1480610	It just happens to do all this other crap.
1481751	1487653	Whereas when I bought my iPhone, I bought it not just because it was a phone, but because I needed a PDA.
1488073	1490613	When I bought it, it was my PDA slash phone.
1490934	1496235	So, see, it just depends on the purpose you're purchasing it for.
1496795	1497936	We have a couple more emails, though.
1498116	1498476	Alrighty.
1499236	1501018	Okay, this one comes from Robert M.
1521517	1526023	Also as a Mac user, I'm pretty happy Sam & Mac Season 1 is coming to the Wii.
1526464	1535295	I can't imagine, of course, considering the PS3 port, that'd be any chance of a Wii portal with a weighted companion GameCube.
1537008	1537688	That would be funny.
1538109	1539670	That's a damn good question about Steam.
1539770	1543612	I had no idea that that was part of the requirements for registering it until you sent that email.
1543632	1544552	That's kind of surprising.
1544833	1545233	You're right.
1545293	1546333	What is the damn difference?
1546354	1546874	There really isn't.
1546934	1553258	I don't know if they're doing that for the copy protection things or whatever it might be, but very interesting that you have to register your game on Steam.
1553878	1559781	I guess there's some people, though, they don't want to put their credit card out there on the internet, so this is a way of doing it.
1559861	1560322	Team Fortress 2.
1563076	1564978	They just said four of the orange box games.
1565619	1567681	Did he specifically say which game it was?
1568221	1568661	I missed it.
1570223	1571604	He just said he grabbed one of the boxes.
1571864	1573746	Well, let's assume it's probably all of them.
1573786	1575027	If it's one of them, it's probably all of them.
1576403	1576764	I don't know.
1576804	1578005	I'm trying to find the email again.
1578025	1578365	There we go.
1578686	1580808	Ross Steel UT says to prevent early release.
1582030	1585014	I can't really see that, though, because the games have been on Steam forever.
1586115	1588197	And it happens on all Half-Life 2 games.
1588237	1589058	It's marketing.
1589119	1590500	It really is just marketing, I think.
1590680	1595046	You know, you put something... The more something is out there, the more people are going to see it.
1595146	1595566	That's how...
1596127	1597948	Plus, it helps that Valve owns Steam.
1598388	1600169	I mean, don't question it.
1600189	1602010	It's probably some type of cross-promotion.
1602030	1606873	They're probably just using Steam in general as their registration source.
1606993	1615358	I mean, because I honestly would rather have the physical copy, I think, than having downloaded it.
1616024	1617045	I totally get what this guy is saying, though.
1617065	1618746	But I don't mind registering it online.
1619186	1619966	But what if you do?
1620387	1623989	What if you don't want to put your information out there and all that stuff?
1624009	1626150	You know, some people don't want to give that stuff away.
1626310	1628811	So it does kind of suck that they're being forced to do it.
1629091	1633874	Well, you have to... If you buy Photoshop, you have to register it and send them all your information.
1634675	1638097	You know, if you buy... When you buy The Sims...
1638917	1639818	You have to register it.
1639838	1641779	When you play World of Warcraft, you set up an account.
1641979	1645120	Yeah, but I'm thinking, I don't know, maybe I'm just going back to old school.
1645160	1652364	Okay, if I walked in and I bought Orange Box for the Xbox 360, sure, I get that little registration card, but half of us throw those things away.
1652684	1654025	You just plop it in, you go.
1654245	1655005	No questions asked.
1655045	1657607	I don't know, but then again, maybe it's stealing everything from Xbox Live.
1657787	1658167	I don't know.
1658367	1666131	See, I think part of the whole reason why they're being a little bit more on it with the registration is just to make sure that you don't have a pirated copy.
1666591	1667792	That your copy is legit.
1668656	1668956	I don't know.
1669036	1670357	I don't necessarily have a problem with it.
1670397	1675981	It's just I do find it kind of weird because I would understand why somebody might go to the store to buy it because they don't want to use Steam.
1676061	1676661	I use Steam.
1676721	1677782	I bought Portal off Steam.
1678782	1684186	I don't have a problem with it, but I could see why somebody might have bought the retail version just not wanting to deal with that.
1684526	1689389	And to find out they have to deal with it anyway, well, I guess that I can see why I might be kind of pissed.
1689909	1690590	All right, one more email.
1691414	1693475	Mailbag at OrangeLodgeRadio.com I thought you said there was one more.
1693535	1694756	No, I said there's a few more.
1694776	1695176	Well, damn it.
1695376	1696417	They're kind of long, too.
1697778	1700960	This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.
1701880	1704642	First of all, and I'm going to mispronounce this because I took French, okay?
1705543	1707504	Feliz cumpleaños.
1708184	1708464	Close.
1709285	1711546	Feliz cumpleaños, I think, is it.
1711746	1712207	To Jamie.
1712287	1712867	You know what that means?
1713107	1713487	Birthday?
1713608	1714228	Happy birthday!
1717196	1718097	I hope you had a great day.
1718278	1718798	Smiley face.
1718999	1720220	I did have a good day.
1720240	1720901	I was very busy.
1721261	1722923	But I got free gelato at Naya.
1723384	1724686	They had Guinness gelato.
1725847	1726047	Sweet.
1726067	1727009	It was fucking good.
1727555	1730398	Anyway, their black sesame was not very good.
1731319	1738808	And second, because of internet issues, I couldn't listen to the last show on live, not 365, and the first on all games.
1739088	1747077	Luckily, I could get hold of the podcast and get my OLR fixed for the week, and the show may be on another stream, but it's still as good as it ever was, and in better sound quality, too.
1747478	1747778	Hearts.
1748599	1749879	Now for the serious stuff.
1750040	1759202	I was hearing the podcast for last week's show and you were talking about bullies banning in Brazil and you were asking if Latin American countries had some kind of... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1759883	1761723	Rob, I think I just lost my connection.
1763464	1764164	So what?
1765765	1766745	I just lost my interwebs.
1767455	1767996	Yeah, you know what?
1768036	1768757	We're having problems.
1768777	1773382	The Justin TV cam went down too, so something is wrong with the wireless networking.
1773462	1776546	So while I set up... Do you still have that one email on your screen?
1776686	1776906	Yeah.
1776986	1780290	Okay, so keep reading that while we try to set up the jerry-rig real quick.
1780470	1781632	Okay.
1781912	1784095	Most of the games and stuff that sold in Latin America...
1786617	1787498	Now for the serious stuff.
1787658	1794884	I was hearing the podcast for last week's show, and you were talking about bullies banning in Brazil, and you were asking if Latin American countries had some kind of rating for games.
1795205	1798808	Well, like Foodie said last week, Chile has it, but basically that's it.
1799348	1809117	Most of the games and stuff that is sold in Latin American stores isn't popularly rated for the audience it's targeted, and only has the ESRB rating, but still it isn't an obligatory thing for retailers to follow.
1809637	1817645	So basically any child can go into the store and buy Grand Theft Auto with no problems at all, as a basic example since it's one of the best selling games in Latin America.
1818245	1829536	Although some stores do follow that ESRB rating and do not sell an M game to a minor, or at least younger kids, but there aren't that many that do so, yet it is basically up to the parents to say yes or no.
1830117	1833960	Although there's another factor in play that isn't related to this, the game's retail value.
1834941	1838103	Video games in Mexico cost at least 25% more than in the U.S.
1838583	1840524	So video games are kind of like a luxury here.
1840744	1845926	By the way, the cheapest console is the Wii, which costs almost double what it costs in the U.S.
1846687	1848227	So not many people buy games.
1848788	1855611	And if they do buy cheap ones, like, for example, bargain bin titles or low-budget ones, which brings us to another problem, piracy.
1856871	1864953	Last month, I made a comment on a Skype call that an article stating that Mexico's video game industry is going to be worth $1 billion in two years from now.
1865633	1872815	Now, I wonder how they are going to manage piracy in Mexico, which is one of the worldwide leading piracy markets for almost everything.
1873215	1876076	And if retailers don't care about their ratings, well, you get the idea.
1877877	1897076	the most people or the main public are also ignorant in knowing which are the games to get basically don't know if a game is good or bad or it's just a game hence why titles like Cars got into the best selling games list of 2006 the same goes for other titles like FIFA or PES and any anime game title DBZ for example
1897957	1906545	So in the end, it's just basically a cultural thing since most of Latin America is accustomed to different things than the US and Canada, especially in the way media is handled.
1906885	1910508	Basically, you can watch someone holding and firing a gun in daytime, afternoon TV.
1910929	1916574	If you have the chance to watch any Mexican news shows or similar, do so and you'll understand what I am talking about.
1917194	1921638	On a side note, Mexican congressmen don't want a video game...
1922959	1923099	P.S.
1923139	1925340	Rob, when are we going to give away the ResHD code?
1947824	1948265	Thanks for watching!
1965327	1966167	We need to just give it away.
1966468	1969809	At some point, we're just going to set up an email and try to get it out that way.
1971050	1972911	By the way, if you switch networks, we should be back up.
1972931	1975072	We have the JerryRig network up.
1975092	1978034	I have to get back in chat, so I won't be able to do it.
1978074	1978894	Switcheroos!
1980555	1981276	God damn it.
1982336	1982576	Okay.
1983077	1984257	Yeah, it went over one of the emails.
1984377	1984577	Okay.
1988225	1990886	Actually, yeah, it's been two months since it was given to me.
1990926	1991666	We haven't given it away.
1992207	1992907	PSS.
1992967	2000731	The PS reminded me that Q Entertainment is doing a special kind of survey in which you can ask Tetsuya Mizuguchi a question for their newsletter.
2001131	2004813	And if you haven't already said so on the show, perhaps it's only ten questions that will be picked.
2005134	2012938	More info is on that game called res.com slash vbulletin slash showthread dot php question mark t equals 90.
2013698	2018900	PSSS, Second Life on Cellphones, I'm a furry and I find that highly hilarious.
2020281	2025022	I'd be curious to know from Mizuguchi if 99 Nights is something they're going to try to do again.
2025302	2032065	I mean, because I know that game got a lot of slack when it first came out, but there's a good game in there somewhere, and maybe they could get it on a second go.
2032905	2040088	Otherwise, I would hope maybe they could do I don't know, maybe Gun Pay on Xbox Live Arcade.
2040688	2041709	We'll see what happens with that.
2042369	2042829	So, uh,
2044332	2047778	Well, we're going to... We've got one more email.
2048599	2049260	Is it up on the screen?
2049580	2050662	We have more emails.
2050863	2052004	My God, it keeps growing.
2052305	2053146	No, it's not keep growing.
2053186	2054368	I told you that we had several.
2058610	2070641	Hey Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, this afternoon I was bored so I thought what the hell why not randomly make 10 questions to ask you guys because you know that's the first thing that comes to everyone's mind when they're bored, right?
2071442	2070641	1.
2071522	2074865	Rob, what's your favorite galaxy in Super Mario Galaxies?
2075226	2079109	And Osfer says, I love Space Junk Galaxy because it pretty much has gravity.
2079390	2080090	Who gives a shit?
2080411	2081512	The music is all relaxing too.
2082145	2085106	The Bumblebee Galaxy, because you can be a bumblebee and that's the best thing in the game.
2086247	2087107	I love Bee Mario.
2087327	2088107	A question for me.
2088908	2090288	Jamie, what's your favorite pinball game?
2090468	2093389	And he says he doesn't play much pinball, but he likes the Gilligan's Island Machine.
2094069	2097491	World Cup Soccer 94, without a doubt.
2098331	2101612	Loki, what is your favorite course out of all the Mario Kart series?
2102032	2103773	And he says that he likes Rainbow Road from Mario Kart 64.
2103833	2106934	I hate Mario Kart's Rainbow Road.
2108075	2108215	Um...
2109321	2115162	I would say probably... I like Wario Stadium from Nintendo 64 a lot.
2116162	2118963	Actually, a lot of the courses from 64 are pretty awesome.
2119923	2122144	I would probably say... I don't know.
2123084	2124084	Probably Wario Stadium.
2124264	2126525	I think that's the most that I've played, is that one.
2126605	2129705	That, and also, I don't remember what it's called.
2129745	2133186	I think it was Peach's Circuit or something like that.
2133306	2136667	It's the one that's got the giant ramp from Nintendo 64.
2138516	2138856	I don't know.
2139857	2141138	But I'd say probably Wario Stadium.
2141618	2142619	I love Toad's Highway.
2142659	2143700	I know I wasn't asked this question.
2143720	2144920	Toad's Highway is pretty awesome too.
2144960	2145941	Freaking love Toad's Highway.
2149724	2151745	So, I don't know.
2151805	2154607	What would be your dream Mario Kart course in a future Mario game?
2156069	2161356	They should do one that's all pixelated and 8-bit like Super Mario Bros.
2161496	2162417	I think that'd be pretty cool.
2162958	2163218	Nice.
2163999	2165321	Mode 7-tastic.
2165521	2168064	Or a better Haunted Mansion course.
2168184	2171989	One that's actually kind of a bit of platforming and stuff.
2172009	2172690	That'd be pretty cool.
2174706	2190940	or one that's what they need to do is add the characters some of the characters from Mario RPG into a future one like including that one villain guy who was raining around the entire time nice I don't remember his name but we have a fan of Moo Moo Farm in the house Frisbee likes Moo Moo is that the one with the train?
2191341	2194723	I love that one Moo Moo Farm is fun
2196558	2223819	good times alright the next question is this is for all three of us who are your favorite brawl characters and Osfer says Wolf O'Donnell is mine obviously his howling taunt is amazing and he fights like a dream I'm just going to really go back to my favorite of all time I was a big Sheik person but Kirby was always my person I love Ness but I think I just I freaking love Pit in this new one too much
2228240	2228500	Loki.
2230181	2231062	My favorite character?
2232042	2240288	I liked... Actually... I liked Rob.
2240768	2241369	Rob the Robot.
2241629	2242109	That was fun.
2242349	2243270	I like me too.
2244691	2245271	I'm great.
2246172	2246812	Next question.
2247052	2247232	Yes.
2247613	2250554	Rob, what would you do if World of Warcraft was shut down and you could never play it again?
2250895	2252155	He says, I hate World of Warcraft.
2252236	2254217	I'd go back to Final Fantasy XI just to piss you off.
2254994	2255514	Here's one for me.
2255534	2256735	He says, here's a toughie for you.
2257256	2262019	In the end, what console do you think will come out on top in this gen's console wars, PS3, 360, or the Wii?
2262779	2265901	And he thinks it's between the 360 and the Wii, but I'll have to say Wii.
2265941	2269764	I love my PS3, but... Yeah.
2270584	2269764	360.
2271565	2275808	Just because it's got the online play perfect.
2275948	2279290	Well, as perfect as it can be, given current technology.
2279991	2281932	It's got a really great library.
2282432	2284554	Lots of stuff that's for people of...
2285214	2287815	any age and type of game that they like.
2288395	2289955	It's pretty versatile, I'd have to say.
2290095	2297338	So I'm going to say the 360 in terms of, first of all, it already had an audience when it came out.
2297818	2301179	And secondly, the learning curve was really, really small on it.
2301479	2304040	So I think I'm right.
2305120	2305400	All righty.
2305876	2306817	Last question for Loki.
2307658	2308598	You get the last one.
2308999	2310440	What is your favorite game and why?
2311221	2316465	And he says, Final Fantasy X is the only game to ever make me pull an all-nighter, so I'd have to say that, and the runner-up is Brawl.
2318206	2319047	Um, I don't know.
2319107	2320328	It depends when you ask me.
2320548	2326834	Well, if you're asking me now, I'd probably say, um, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is pretty fun.
2327374	2327694	I don't know.
2327774	2328775	I play a lot of things in a row.
2329276	2329416	Um,
2330728	2331749	I don't have a favorite game.
2331789	2336152	I don't like to pick one that's just favorite because I go from one to another, you know, all the time.
2336813	2342197	But, yeah, I'd say right now Saints Row, but I know that's not my absolute favorite.
2342777	2345600	My favorite game is Super Metroid, but most of chat already knew that.
2346340	2347501	Well, you know what mine is.
2348762	2349102	All right.
2349222	2349883	Guardian Legend.
2350323	2351344	So enough of wasting your time.
2351364	2352325	I went about that faceplate.
2352345	2354547	Take your time with it, and I understand you guys have enough to manage.
2355307	2358650	I'm still working on getting one, but I think someone else is supposed to bring one.
2358970	2360051	I've got all the stuff to work on it.
2361121	2361702	We'll figure it out.
2361882	2362903	We'll talk amongst ourselves.
2363163	2364184	Thanks for reading, Osfer.
2364224	2364564	P.S.
2364624	2366346	Rob, I hope your pancreas get better.
2366926	2367467	I hope so, too.
2367947	2369429	I wish you would come to ASIN, Krize.
2369449	2370009	I wish I would, too.
2370029	2371671	I wish you would come to ASIN as well.
2372171	2378317	However, Penny Arcade Expo is like 95% certain for me at this point.
2379538	2381220	The last email.
2381360	2381980	Thank God.
2382100	2382381	Holy shit.
2382401	2383221	Thank you, RawStillUT.
2384503	2385604	Thank you, RawStillUT.
2389311	2394652	DC vs. Mortal Kombat, a horrifying concept, not because of graphics.
2394672	2396452	Mortal Kombat hasn't used mocap graphics in ages.
2396912	2398253	I was bringing that up as an example.
2398793	2403034	But because, according to Kotaku, there isn't going to be any fatalities, the blood will be incredibly limited.
2403094	2404494	Why the hell would anyone bother?
2404674	2405434	I think we've covered that.
2406894	2408095	The fighting styles...
2411343	2413686	However that wasn't the main topic I wanted to discuss.
2413786	2420195	The idea of higher meaning in games, meaning in art in general.
2420575	2428225	You often hear complaints from gamers about games not having esoteric higher meaning compared to other mediums.
2429227	2440199	However, many people bring up movies, books, paintings that are either A, really blatant in their meetings, Schindler's List, Blood Diamond, or B, way too damned esoteric and oddball for anyone to get on their own, which is Akira.
2440559	2446546	By the way, in defense of Akira, it was a cliff note version of a really freaking long manga that
2448038	2449499	I'm not even going to go into it, just read the manga.
2451319	2456622	My view has always been that if it's too complex for someone to get without a fucking explanation by the creator, it isn't worth the time.
2457982	2459403	Well, you should watch Shock Treatment then.
2459563	2469607	Then you'll find out what... By the way, this Friday, April 25th in San Francisco, Shock Treatment.
2469847	2472068	I'm not performing in it anymore, though, due to my sickness.
2472108	2474149	I couldn't do rehearsals, but I'm still going.
2474645	2477928	My view has always been that if... Okay, I've read that part.
2478549	2490481	By the same token, hammering someone over the head with a message and not leaving room for subtle metaphor and commenting comes off as preachy, a primary reason I can barely stand Kojima's sledgehammer style in the Metal Gear Solid series.
2490561	2496267	I've always thought that a metaphor hints at innuendo made the best way to convey a message in entertainment media.
2496587	2525556	look at the way humans generally have distrust of aliens and vice versa in Mass Effect for example while a cliche in and of itself the way it's presented shows just how ugly racism is Final Fantasy 7 had a very strong pro-environment message hidden in the belts and zippers of Nomura's design with Mako and the Lifestream an effective metaphor for the oil we've ripped from the earth and the land and animals we routinely exploit often there is something to be taken other than simple entertainment if you look hard enough
2527436	2531678	and also sometimes small meanings can be found in even the most mundane parts of games.
2531998	2538820	For example, there's a part in Rainbow Six Vegas 2 where, warning spoilers, your team is sent in to check three buildings for a bomb.
2539400	2540000	Should I read this?
2542121	2542461	Who cares?
2543241	2545182	Just try to sum it up in one sentence.
2545302	2545662	I don't know.
2548022	2553324	It's basically dealing with having to deal with failure instead of it being a game over.
2554764	2556407	and instead of game over, start over.
2557609	2558991	You failed, you have to deal with it.
2561635	2563117	I would like to see a video game tell you that.
2563157	2564880	You fail at life, deal with it.
2565020	2566442	Oh my god, they set us up the bomb.
2568217	2571678	I was more like, you fail, here's your consequences for what you screwed up on.
2572878	2579000	I often wonder if the call for higher meaning in games is just from people who want to join the stuck-up art connoisseur club.
2579520	2590203	Me, I've always found the word art to be nothing more than something old, rich, often white men used to hold up what they prefer while simultaneously putting down anything made by the lower classes as being unworthy of the art designation.
2590723	2594565	It's not surprising, in his time, William Shakespeare was considered a lowbrow playwright.
2594905	2598567	Now, hundreds of years after his death, he's considered one of the greatest playwrights of all time.
2599048	2604351	What isn't heralded for all time won't be decided by us, but by those who come long after and look back.
2604831	2611374	Maybe one day, stuck-up elites will hold up Lost Odyssey and no more heroes as the pinnacle of art and gaming.
2611394	2612295	Just something to think about.
2613175	2615116	That's a very interesting point, I must say.
2616357	2622380	It's going to be very interesting to see what kind of games are truly remembered as classics, and will it be the things that were necessarily popular today?
2622520	2622820	I don't know.
2623978	2626040	Another aside, I love the new PlayStation Store.
2626100	2627542	It's even better than Marketplace now.
2627902	2630464	So easy to find everything and the games install automatically now.
2630524	2631105	It's wonderful.
2631545	2636429	Finally, and yes, I know I'm rambling, here's another anti-digital distribution warning.
2637350	2643716	Way back in 1981, a service called Play Cable came out, which allowed you to download Intellivision games through your cable system.
2644096	2653523	The problem is that the adapter only had 4K of RAM and when Intellivision games started coming out in 8K and 16K carts, the play cable service was rendered useless and was discontinued in 1993.
2654163	2658366	The moral of the story is that files will always outgrow bandwidth.
2658806	2661188	Who the hell wants to download 50 gigs of Metal Gear Solid 4?
2661828	2666432	What about when games start taking up triple or even quadruple layer Blu-ray discs 100 gigs?
2666932	2671535	Movie and game files aren't going to stand still for the sake of bandwidth, especially when ISPs are...
2672876	2676838	are heart set on raping consumers for bandwidth in the US, Europe, and especially Australia.
2677499	2680000	Well, you're going to be seeing discs for a long, long time.
2680080	2681341	Yours truly, Rostil UT.
2682182	2683603	That is such a freaking good letter.
2685624	2685904	Alright.
2686604	2695089	If you want to send us good letters, mailbag at orangelauntrader.com, but try to keep it to 500 words or less, just so we have time to read them all in the air.
2695109	2697371	Send me something to drink with every email.
2698171	2700313	Alright, let's get back to some gaming news.
2702165	2704546	and we'll go to Loki about Bionic Commando, yes?
2705007	2724297	Yes, Bionic Commando Rearmed has been rated by the ESRB it is of course rated M and they didn't really specify why it's rated M but it I think has to do with the game's main villain's head exploding
2725217	2728780	So that's pretty awesome.
2729020	2730401	I just like the fact that it's rated.
2730441	2733243	That means it's on its way and hopefully will be out very soon.
2734044	2739068	And along with it, hopefully will come Castle Crashers because I hope that game is out very soon as well.
2741549	2741830	Awesome.
2742978	2745241	I am very excited for Bionic Commando Rearmed.
2745301	2747965	It's going to be hot, because the old one is a hot game.
2748566	2755255	Alright, moving on to more Grand Theft Auto stories, but this may not be exactly what you're looking for.
2755676	2759401	It seems like there were a lot of pre-orders for Grand Theft Auto 4 in Australia.
2759761	2761483	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2777352	2778933	Yeah, it's a gun up the rectum, I believe.
2797168	2803713	Gamers are saying they cancelled their orders with Australian shops and will import a cheaper uncut version going around the law.
2803953	2804553	That is true.
2804633	2809496	PlayStation 3 is the region free, so there you go.
2810117	2818062	If you're in Australia and you want a region free or uncut version of the game, import a... Frisbee wants to know, let me ask a question.
2818082	2819963	Did Saw 4 get shown in Australia?
2820023	2820864	Very good question.
2821865	2822585	I mean, seriously.
2824507	2824727	Well...
2826514	2836497	This is a very interesting, though, kind of counter-reaction to this, is that you have all these people that are canceling the game and realizing that the PS3 is region-free, so they're just like, you know what?
2836537	2836858	Screw it.
2836878	2837658	We're going to import it.
2838138	2840919	Very interesting combat.
2841239	2843020	Some 360 games are region-free, too.
2845621	2858771	it'll be interesting to see the further fallout from this but regardless censorship kind of pisses us off and so we dedicate the FUs of the week to all these people that just said FU to the Australian censorship board that are going to import their copies instead
2875140	2881844	My FU of the week, um, it's not really directed toward the person, but toward the situation.
2882685	2887108	Um, I got woke up, um, well, I had already woke up once and then passed right back out.
2887548	2892911	But I was woke up from a dead sleep by someone calling me, saying that I left my keys in her car.
2893852	2896534	And, Rob, you know what I am when I'm just waking up.
2896634	2897674	I'm incoherent.
2898855	2901657	So, I have no idea what she's talking about.
2901717	2903218	I still think I'm dreaming, okay?
2904078	2905999	And I was like, but I need my keys.
2906019	2908140	She's like, I can't bring them to you.
2908200	2909141	You're the one who left them.
2909161	2911082	And just being really condescending and rude about it.
2911102	2914284	I was like, wait, what the hell are you talking about?
2914304	2918666	I was like, she's like, well, you need your... I was like, I need my house key too.
2918726	2919567	She's like, you don't have a copy?
2919587	2920587	I was like, I don't know.
2920707	2922388	She's just being really rude about it.
2922428	2923089	But I was like, look...
2924009	2927750	I just woke up, you don't need to be condescending and rude, okay?
2928150	2929371	I'm not gonna put up with that shit.
2929991	2933112	I don't put up with it from anybody, if I can help it.
2934793	2938534	Also, um... F you to, um...
2941946	2944967	I guess I don't really have much else in the way of F.U.
2945307	2945847	Oh yeah, F.U.
2945867	2947048	the stupid kids at the park.
2948448	2952790	My friend Sonia came over and we took pictures of the doll feed that I finished for Kristen.
2953830	2954770	And one of mine.
2955030	2957071	These stupid kids are like, why are you taking pictures of dolls?
2957091	2959632	I'm like, why does anybody take pictures of anything?
2959652	2962033	I was like, don't be stupid.
2962053	2962993	So that was it.
2964273	2964654	Loki.
2966254	2966474	F.U.
2966514	2967655	this chair I'm sitting in.
2968675	2969075	That's it.
2971201	3000462	FU to Subway who I suspect gave me food poisoning on my vacation that kept me in bed until 6pm yesterday meaning I missed out on two trips to the beach that kind of pisses me off I mean I guess I should be thankful I got to go on the trip at all because the state of my pancreas was a little bit in question you know with everything I've been going through recently but still food poisoning sucks at least I didn't have it for two weeks people shouldn't be sick on their vacations what kind of horrible punishment is that what did I do to you mother nature
3001018	3001799	What did I do to you?
3001819	3004783	Alright, let's get back into the show.
3005984	3007727	Get back into some more gaming news, eh, Jamie?
3008848	3010951	I think that that's entirely doable, Rob.
3012332	3012653	Oh, good.
3013422	3013642	Yes.
3015422	3016943	So apparently Wii games look like crap.
3017783	3018463	Or most of them do.
3018903	3027705	According to the developer High Voltage, they're basically claiming that most of the end products for the Wii don't look as good as latter-day PS2 titles.
3028685	3035167	And this is, of course, after they have said they're working on something called Conduit, which is a first-person shooter boasting...
3036988	3040993	to be really advanced and supposed to actually be, I guess, the best one on the system.
3043616	3050344	They're quoted as saying that they think it's a real shame that publishers and developers aren't taking advantage of the technical possibilities of the Wii platform.
3050744	3055209	Most Wii games don't even look as good as Saturday PS2 titles, and that's a real slap to the face of consumers.
3056221	3059442	So they're saying that they're wanting to raise a new bar.
3059682	3063183	But honestly, and how many times have I said this?
3063323	3066904	It doesn't matter what the hell the game looks like as long as it's fun.
3067985	3068325	I don't know.
3068345	3069505	Their engines look pretty nice.
3071026	3073426	I mean, Katamari Damacy, let's face it, looks like crap.
3073466	3076808	But a lot of people really enjoy the heck out of that game because it's fun.
3077568	3077988	Good point.
3079218	3083221	I'm sure the soccer moms of America have been throwing themselves behind the Wii, don't really care.
3083562	3084823	Although I like to have both.
3084923	3086504	I like to have a pretty game that's fun.
3088026	3089087	Is that too much to ask?
3089327	3089928	I don't think so.
3089948	3092310	I don't think so.
3092510	3098536	Well, High Voltage released a tech demo of their new engine, and it does look pretty good.
3098876	3099577	Although the graphics...
3101053	3103875	The Wii is just two GameCubes duct taped together or whatever?
3129687	3130387	Well, it's not even that.
3130487	3138252	It's just people are looking at the Wii as a cheap developing platform, and so they're putting no effort into releasing games for it.
3138292	3141854	They're just charging like 20 bucks for them, but they're garbage.
3142714	3143955	So, that's the problem.
3145915	3150778	One game that's not quite garbage, though, is coming to Steam pretty soon here.
3151358	3151758	Luminous.
3152118	3160263	Actually, Q Entertainment and Valve have kind of joined forces, and Luminous will be available on the service.
3160724	3163786	It looks like a few different packs you can get.
3164326	3165467	The base pack for $9.95...
3168735	3177699	will be available, as well as the advanced pack containing 21 new challenge mode skins, 60 puzzles for puzzle mode, and 35 stages for puzzle mode.
3178339	3183442	That'll come out for another $7.95, or you can grab the whole thing for $14.95.
3184902	3188024	And that'll be made available Friday, April 25th.
3188224	3192366	If you didn't already have Luminous in one of the 5,000 other places it's available, there's your chance.
3193246	3193386	Right?
3193927	3194087	Yeah.
3194407	3194687	All right.
3195509	3196250	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3219526	3223750	When we always have all this bad news about stupid kids, we might have some good news here.
3224591	3226613	This has to do with the mother of one teenager.
3226633	3235501	What happened is that this kid was supposed to be doing some chores, but he decided to break the vacuum cleaner so that he didn't have to do any work.
3235901	3243287	So what happened is that the mom went on to Craigslist, and this posting was found on Richmond's Craigslist, and it says this.
3243968	3247610	My son seems to think everything should be handed to him on a silver platter.
3247990	3249631	So the Xbox is going bye-bye.
3250031	3253253	I do have an assortment of games as well that I will sell for $15 each.
3253673	3254574	Price is firm.
3254874	3258516	Must replace vacuum that he broke thinking it would get him out of having to do chores.
3260273	3266359	By the way, the mother has also informed the world that she's busted him for looking at porn sites.
3267600	3277671	The internet access is now locked behind a password, and mom apparently went onto his Myspace and put a picture of Snoopy on the Myspace.
3279659	3287504	This is a mom that is taking no crap from her kid and violating his privacy in every sense of the word.
3288745	3289766	But what is the old saying?
3289866	3295750	As long as you live under our house, I will log on to your MySpace and put up pictures of Snoopy.
3298292	3301914	Yeah, I mean, like GS68 in chat says, it could have been worse.
3301934	3302795	It could have been Hello Kitty.
3305134	3307175	I think Snoopy means she's snooping.
3308136	3309537	I think there was a pun there.
3311238	3313079	Good job for her bringing the smack down.
3313099	3313580	You're right.
3313980	3315001	Sometimes kids are brats.
3315361	3315721	I don't know.
3316121	3319664	Selling the Xbox off might be a bit extreme, but I don't know.
3319704	3324247	If this kid has repetitive issues, then maybe it's what has to be done.
3324287	3326268	I'm not going to tell you how to raise your kid in that sense.
3326348	3329991	You know what's best, but that does seem a little extreme.
3330011	3332712	This must have been one bad fucking kid for that to happen.
3332773	3333413	I think so.
3335734	3337816	Do Not Want Lovely
3365848	3366308	That's great.
3366448	3367969	No, I was a bad kid.
3368469	3369069	I was a bad kid.
3369989	3371670	I was naughty when I was like three or four.
3371710	3373791	I was always the bad kid that had to go time out in class.
3374071	3375691	And then I turned into a perfect little angel.
3375931	3376772	And that's how I am today.
3377772	3377972	Right?
3378992	3379253	Right?
3380133	3381973	You got your halo hung up by horns?
3382334	3382814	Yeah, whatever.
3383414	3384234	Back to gaming news.
3384754	3388296	Yeah, I was going to say, we got other games to talk about too.
3389256	3391537	But kudos for that mom for having balls.
3391957	3392197	Anyway.
3394074	3399458	Our buddies at Namco Bondi have brought us some shooting stuff.
3401500	3415351	In the summer, there is Power Up Forever on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, which is a top-down shooter where as you shoot things, you absorb their energy and you grow.
3415892	3416913	So you...
3419088	3423310	I'm not going to compare this with Katamari as the article compares it with Katamari.
3424530	3428612	However, I see it as more of expanding your universe.
3429812	3431113	A perspective type thing.
3431173	3433093	The bigger you get, the more you can see.
3434534	3447379	As you get more power-ups, you're supposed to see larger and larger enemies that were always there, but you just couldn't see them before because you were a needle.
3448686	3453729	But it's supposed to be like an infinitely going game, I guess.
3456350	3459031	It just goes on and on, my friend.
3459071	3461353	This is the game that never ends.
3461513	3463194	It just goes on and on, my friend.
3463214	3464074	I hate Firefox.
3464774	3465775	I hate my laptop, actually.
3468320	3472724	I was just thinking, you know, we don't have enough space shooters on Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation 3.
3473024	3474725	So I was really hoping we would get some more.
3475446	3476247	Don't worry, Rob.
3476267	3477068	They will never do that.
3477088	3478609	Weren't you just thinking that too?
3478689	3481512	I'm like, God, what is it we're missing on Xbox Live?
3481592	3482072	Music games?
3482112	3483433	No, we have Boom Boom Rocket.
3483453	3484094	That's all we need.
3485015	3485535	What are we missing?
3485575	3486296	Adventure games?
3486336	3487657	Oh, no, we have the Arcadian Quest.
3488278	3489559	Oh, space shooters.
3489659	3490760	We don't have any of those.
3492942	3493563	That's what we need.
3494113	3496414	But wasn't there Galaxy Wars?
3496974	3497614	Geometry Wars?
3498515	3499675	I was being facetious.
3500075	3503476	I know, and I was going... Hey, Rob.
3503817	3503977	What?
3508743	3517308	One thing that we don't have enough, or I'm sure we're not going to have enough pretty soon of, is games that are going to use the brand new balance board that's coming with Wii Fit.
3517708	3522090	Well, fear not, because Take-Two has decided, hey, guess what?
3522190	3523410	Don King's Prizefighter?
3523651	3524771	That's right, bitches.
3524831	3526932	It's going to have balance board training games.
3527853	3528973	Oh, boy.
3529493	3536337	Because when you're done playing Wii Fit, you can get Wii Fit again with training games and the...
3537250	3537570	I don't know.
3537771	3548921	It's a boxing game that has a bunch of actually kind of almost rhythm games to it to train in but now you can use the Wii Fit balance board as well.
3548981	3554106	Because when I think Don King I think Wii Fit DDR-ish type thing.
3554687	3556409	Well, it's a boxing game, okay?
3557446	3557746	I know.
3558006	3561128	Maybe they'll have like... Well, that might actually be kind of fun.
3561168	3564569	A game that combines like Wii Boxing with the Wii Fit board for balance.
3564609	3566830	That actually could be kind of cool.
3567430	3568771	Except this is the training portion.
3568791	3572993	I don't think it's going to actually have, you know... But here's the thing that I think would be pretty funny.
3574233	3580036	They could use like a balance board mini game or something like that where you have to stay balanced on Don King's hair.
3582277	3583317	That might be challenging.
3585738	3586859	That would definitely be challenging.
3587182	3587382	I know.
3587402	3587722	I know.
3613897	3615418	Quake 3 was my favorite in the series.
3615438	3620863	Not to knock betas or anything, and I love signing up for betas.
3621464	3636877	For some reason, I don't play them once I sign up for them, so I guess I'm not really their prime beta candidate, but I really wish there was betas for things other than, I don't know, first-person shooters might be nice.
3636997	3640881	I know that they do have the occasional beta for an MMO game, but you know.
3642529	3645430	I don't play MMOs anymore, but something else would be nice.
3646651	3647311	I get it.
3648331	3650392	Usually the thing is, what are they trying to beta test?
3650412	3654534	They're trying to stress test their servers, so that's why it's always these type of MMOs.
3654694	3655874	I don't know, Animal Crossing?
3656955	3657735	I'd be down with that.
3657895	3659856	Or a racing game?
3659936	3663658	I somehow doubt it, because Nintendo is kind of their own little box.
3663698	3664938	I don't think they do beta testing.
3664958	3668199	They don't really care about the quality of their online anyway, so that's fine.
3669640	3671161	I don't know, maybe a racing game or something.
3671221	3672021	That might be pretty cool.
3673042	3675664	Don't expect it to work perfectly because it is a beta.
3683010	3684131	You can check that out again.
3684191	3687554	QuakeLive.com if you want to sign up for the Quake Live beta.
3687674	3689655	I just might because I do love Quake 3 that much.
3690075	3694419	It's one of the only FPSs I really played a whole lot of that I just enjoyed very much.
3695287	3708051	Well, for any of our, I guess, listeners in Japan, because it's probably only coming out there, Squeenix has a new RPG for the mobile phones, and it's called Elark, E-L-L-A-R-K.
3708632	3718215	It's a free online RPG, though, and it will be launched in June for the three major Japanese characters, but it's...
3720367	3722869	This style looks sort of Final Fantasy.
3722889	3726493	The little bit of artwork I'm seeing is sort of Final Fantasy tactics-tastic.
3728434	3728875	So maybe.
3730937	3731717	Well, it is free.
3733399	3736461	I mean, how can you say free if you live somewhere else than here?
3737102	3737462	Yeah, really?
3737482	3738683	Because our cell phones suck.
3739684	3741166	They only barely do TV.
3742607	3744609	Even Europe's kicking our butt in cell phones.
3745563	3751048	Well, here's one thing we aren't going to be free of anytime soon, and that is new Spider-Man games.
3752249	3753450	Hoorah!
3753490	3764379	Still trying to recapture their triumph of the PlayStation version of Spider-Man 2, probably one of the greatest Spider-Man games that they've made so far.
3764819	3772486	Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man Friend or Foe weren't very good games.
3773706	3796703	Web of Shadows is a free roaming open-ended adventure that's going to be headed to all of the current consoles out there and handhelds and is being brought to you by Shaba Games and Treyarch.
3797739	3817254	and um didn't really say what the game's gonna revolve around but there's a lot of Venom looking you know stuff and they also said there's possibly other um Marvel Universe characters that you'll actually get to play as as well they hinted to that stuff so I don't know neat I guess but
3819232	3821933	Just the last... I remember when Spider-Man games used to be good.
3822053	3823814	You don't trust the track record of Spider-Man games.
3823834	3825514	The last few games have really sucked.
3825674	3828795	Especially, I mean, Spider-Man 3 where you'd sink into the grass.
3829596	3830316	Like quicksand.
3830596	3831136	That's funny.
3831556	3833197	SSJ100Matt kind of agrees with you.
3833237	3835518	He says, I'm a sucker for free-roam New York City games.
3835558	3836978	I'm really hoping this game doesn't suck.
3839298	3839778	We shall see.
3840718	3842199	Hey, our Skype line is just about open.
3842239	3845580	We only have a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the Skype line before we end our program.
3845600	3849021	1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number or our username on Skype.
3849061	3850801	Get ready, Orange Lounge Radio.
3851361	3853002	But first we have to do a quick follow-up.
3853042	3862604	Remember last week we talked about that Famitsu was reporting or was saying that a new DS is very likely to be announced at the next E3.
3862904	3865565	Well, Nintendo came right out and denied it.
3866425	3875208	They denied it and said, no, we are not making a new DS and we're not really revealing anything that we're going to be revealing at E3 until E3.
3876508	3890413	It should be noted, however, that a couple years ago, one day before it was announced, Nintendo denied having any knowledge about a DS Lite and then a day later the DS Lite was announced.
3891033	3904538	So, you know, you can always take Nintendo denials with a grain of salt, but at the same time, the original news has a bit of a grain of salt as well, because it's probably based simply off the fact that, gee, Nintendo likes to redo their consoles all the time.
3905839	3914542	Also, was it the publisher of Famitsu was the one originally quoting that it was going to be announced at E3, and then they retracted that statement, too.
3915923	3918064	Which is interesting.
3918084	3918364	Interesting.
3919110	3919430	I don't know.
3919971	3920751	Just wait for E3.
3920792	3922093	What, is it a few months away?
3923054	3923394	Seriously.
3924054	3924355	Alright.
3925035	3927017	One more story, then the Skype line is open.
3927437	3930240	DarkSakura, our final official story for the evening.
3932422	3942731	Well, there is going to be some good news for Mass Effect PC players and that is the actually free content.
3943291	3944392	Free content is nice, isn't it?
3944412	3944933	Yay, free!
3946705	3953388	Um, but that's the, um, Bring Down the Sky is going to be free for anyone who's interested in it.
3953608	3956350	Is it bad that I didn't even realize Mass Effect was on PC?
3957050	3959911	Like, I thought it was an Xbox 360 only game for some reason.
3961052	3962993	I'm just, I'm just out of it, I guess.
3963213	3966494	Well, yeah, well, they had to pay for it on Xbox Live for five bucks.
3966654	3968935	Yeah, but that's kind of cool that they gave it for free on PC.
3969155	3969336	Yeah.
3969516	3971156	Maybe they just couldn't think of a way to charge for it.
3972437	3973718	It's in pieces of their soul.
3974198	3974498	Who knows?
3975549	3975969	All right.
3976470	3984074	Well, it's also free for you to call in and interact with us on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3984594	3988056	And once you know it, we're already getting hammered with phone calls, so let's open up the lines.
3988136	3989957	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3989977	3990357	Who's this?
3991078	3992759	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma from New York.
3993419	3994540	Ranma from New York.
3994580	3998182	Do you like the free roaming New York City games as well, like SSJ 100, Matt?
3999409	4000610	I just heard about it myself.
4001370	4005993	What about Grand Theft Auto and all these types of other games that are parodying New York?
4006013	4007714	Do you like seeing parodies of your home city?
4008594	4009334	Sure, I'm all for it.
4009855	4011836	Alright, what did you call in to talk to us about tonight?
4012476	4014938	Well, before I begin, Jamie, happy birthday.
4015098	4015678	Thank you.
4016538	4017279	You're welcome.
4018159	4020420	I want to give you a brief talk about New York Comic Con.
4020941	4024823	First thing, there was no John Woo talking about the Metroid Prime movie.
4025327	4026387	Iron Man Movie Maybe next year
4055666	4057507	Yeah, it'll be pretty awesome though.
4057847	4060089	But overall, the con itself was fun.
4060209	4065112	At least it was on the higher level of the Jabba Center where it was actually spread out.
4065132	4067093	We could actually walk around and breathe.
4068815	4069055	Nice.
4070496	4076800	Yeah, there was a lot of people there, a lot of webcomic artists that were there.
4077040	4081603	And you know, Jamie, I did send you a picture, so... I like the picture.
4081623	4081723	Sure.
4082847	4083428	VG Cats
4110106	4114391	So you actually got the guy who draws VG Cats to draw a picture of Jamie.
4114631	4115753	That's cute!
4117114	4118316	Yeah, he showed it to me before the show.
4118696	4120498	Oh my god, that's so cute!
4121339	4122220	So, very cool!
4122561	4122681	Yay!
4123143	4124584	Why couldn't you get the rest of us, huh?
4124604	4125804	We gotta wait for our... No, I'm just kidding.
4125844	4126805	No, I think that's great.
4127185	4129806	VGCast is like my favorite webcomic right now.
4129966	4130786	No, you know what's funny?
4130826	4132747	He actually calls... I know how she says right now.
4134128	4134748	But it might change.
4135028	4135828	It's been for a while.
4135888	4138469	Depending on what bribes other webcomics send her.
4138729	4142551	He called me, I guess like Friday, I think he called me.
4142551	4143391	He's got the picture from us at E3.
4143411	4144452	It wasn't me that got the picture.
4144472	4145513	You can thank Gio Dia.
4145533	4147173	She picked out the picture for me to take over there.
4147193	4147273	Nice.
4147293	4147894	Well, there you have it.
4147914	4149114	So that is the guy who does VG Cats, Drew Jamie.
4149134	4149415	That's awesome.
4149475	4149575	Yay!
4172691	4173091	Very cool.
4173251	4174052	Oh, that's so cool.
4174092	4176213	I'm going to have to write a thank you too.
4176773	4178014	But thank you so much.
4178074	4178734	I appreciate that.
4178774	4180155	That's like the best thing ever.
4180195	4182036	Well, we should just invite him on the damn show.
4182296	4182976	I'd like to.
4183296	4184937	There were a website of the week once.
4184977	4185277	We'll go.
4185297	4185677	All right.
4185697	4186358	We'll work on that.
4187178	4187518	We'll get it.
4187738	4188679	We'll work it out.
4189519	4190540	Well, Ranma, thank you so much.
4190560	4191500	That was very nice of you to do.
4191560	4193981	And the whole chat room is fawning over it right now.
4194001	4194482	So there you go.
4195506	4198267	You notice how it just looks like Jamie if you think about it?
4198287	4200488	Just her normal attitude per se.
4200868	4201948	Yeah, it's cool.
4201968	4205530	Except now I'm going to make her wear cat ears just to compare.
4205610	4206990	I have several cat-eared hats.
4207030	4207790	Thank you, Rob.
4209511	4209791	All right.
4210091	4213553	Anything else you want to share with our chatters today, Rama, and our listeners?
4214293	4215113	Well, that's pretty much it.
4215133	4216414	I just wanted to get that across.
4216854	4217274	That was it.
4218356	4219096	Well, thank you very much.
4219157	4219837	We appreciate it.
4219977	4221178	No problem.
4221198	4221718	Anytime.
4222559	4224620	You make Jamie's birthday last all weekend long.
4224640	4225521	I'm sure she can't complain.
4226641	4226862	Yes.
4226942	4227642	Oh, and Jamie?
4229203	4231985	Gio wants to know, where did you get the gelato from?
4232045	4233226	The Guinness gelato?
4233466	4233826	Naya.
4234967	4235247	Okay.
4236928	4241389	I've only seen Naya in California, so I don't know if it's all over the place.
4242370	4244210	They have different flavors that circulate.
4244390	4247671	They also had champagne gelato.
4248171	4254973	They also had mojito and Captain Morgan gelato.
4254993	4255273	Okay.
4256162	4256843	I like that one.
4257303	4259284	The Guinness gelato is freaking good.
4260224	4266708	They usually have Nutella, but if ever you find Anaya and they have whole wheat gelato, try it.
4266748	4267588	It tastes like cereal.
4270269	4272511	Amanda in chat says they're Bay Area.
4272591	4273931	I think they only have six stores.
4274051	4275872	If that's the Amanda I'm thinking it is, then hi.
4277053	4279294	They're Bay Area only.
4279954	4281095	They're really good though.
4281175	4282476	It's not Pinkberry, I'm sorry.
4282496	4284017	We just got...
4285785	4286886	We're going to let you go, Ranma.
4286926	4287326	Take care.
4287526	4287727	I'll try.
4288267	4288747	Bye.
4288787	4289868	I'll catch up to you guys later.
4289888	4292090	1877 Game.
4292130	4292751	Oh, dang.
4293852	4295933	I just hung up and boop, here comes another call.
4296274	4297515	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4297535	4297895	Who's this?
4298796	4299476	GS68.
4299676	4300437	Hi, GS68.
4300457	4301077	What's on your mind, buddy?
4302229	4305570	First of all, I'm happy 428 to everyone who celebrates it.
4305730	4307630	Happy 420, dude!
4308370	4309611	Where's our Zaku call?
4309631	4310971	You know we need a Zaku call on 420.
4311231	4312191	He's celebrating.
4312251	4314312	Alright, what's up, GS68?
4315132	4329715	Anyways, this week was the one-year anniversary of the VT Massacre, and I just want to say one thing to everyone who pinned the blame on video games, especially people who didn't even have any resources.
4330345	4334386	Any resources or citations for that?
4334546	4335546	Such as Lord Voldemort?
4336546	4336806	Yes.
4337327	4346128	I mean, why didn't he go up to the killers, the family, and say all that to their faces?
4348349	4348869	I dare you.
4349089	4357471	I dare you to go up to his parents, his siblings, if he has any, their faces, and
4358453	4361554	Start talking about how his son was influenced by video games and all that.
4362594	4380979	At the same time, though, I think this whole week of memory and everything is sort of to just kind of... I think we have to kind of let those bitter feelings just kind of go right now and try to look back and just kind of remember those that lost their lives and what was just a senseless and horrible thing and tragedy.
4381279	4385020	So at the same time, it's kind of like, let's just not draw the pain out any longer.
4385100	4385540	You know what I mean?
4387501	4387641	So...
4389403	4390584	But, you know, I understand.
4390624	4394226	It was kind of stupid for some of those people to be blaming video games in the first place.
4394346	4399510	And it's just kind of sad that it keeps going on throughout all these tragic events that happened.
4400130	4401071	And the call dropped.
4401131	4401711	We lost them.
4402211	4402932	Was that bandwidth?
4403192	4404133	Is the network still going?
4405293	4405834	I'm still on.
4405934	4406674	All right.
4406714	4407655	Well, we lost them.
4408596	4411878	But, yeah, and, of course, you know what's interesting?
4411898	4414600	I have a friend that's actually going to be going to Virginia Tech next year.
4414720	4417601	So, you know, I'm just – I'm –
4419398	4420539	I know this is probably a difficult time.
4420559	4423600	I know we have listeners out there too, so I know it was probably a difficult week.
4425241	4426742	Our thoughts are with you guys.
4426862	4428943	Definitely, let's just try and get past it.
4431224	4435747	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4436507	4440209	While we wait for some calls to drop in, do we have any quick last minute stories by chance?
4440750	4441490	Anything last minute?
4442063	4442965	Yes?
4443145	4444327	Alright, what would you like to share?
4446551	4447692	I'm just going to suggest...
4449921	4457325	Blitz League was one of the games that they announced at Midway's Gamers Day that's getting a sequel, same as Game Party.
4457365	4460607	Apparently both of those games are getting sequels.
4460627	4461368	Game Party?
4461688	4462268	Game Party.
4462308	4466191	That was the one that had beer pong in it, but they called it something else, Pink Cup.
4467271	4469433	That's what they were calling it instead of beer pong.
4469753	4470533	Well, we got another call.
4470553	4471494	Let's go take it real quick.
4472374	4473635	I'm curious to know more about this, though.
4473655	4474616	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4474636	4474956	Who's this?
4476155	4477915	Hello, this is RawSteelUT.
4478075	4479156	Hello, RawSteelUT.
4479196	4480136	What is on your mind?
4481796	4482256	A little bit.
4482316	4487617	Before I go into that, I would like to thank DMN for being an asshole and a grief friend banning me from the chat.
4487697	4490058	That leaves me with time to play games while I'm listening.
4490478	4491018	Very nice.
4492538	4493759	I'm not even going to go there.
4494539	4495819	I don't know what the heck's going on.
4495939	4500960	Sometimes I feel not in control of our own chat room, but we'll try to get that sorted out.
4501100	4502180	What else is on your mind, though, buddy?
4503581	4505301	I don't know if you saw this, but
4506078	4512480	Recently, Vivendi had a really creative promotion for their upcoming Ghostbusters game.
4515081	4519562	They actually restored the old Ectomobile, you know the car from the movie?
4521583	4527245	And they parked it at a Best Buy in Minnesota for promotional purposes.
4529425	4533427	They actually have a picture on Kotaku I'd link to the chat, but you know.
4534427	4534647	And it
4535069	4536650	I mean, they did a bang-up job on it.
4536670	4537470	It's very nice.
4537850	4545534	I didn't see the car, but I saw the box art for the game, which I found to be half appropriate and half boring.
4545554	4546715	Did you see the box art that was posted?
4546735	4547775	I think that's just temporary.
4547996	4550597	You think it's just one of those placeholder things for people who want to pre-order the game?
4550637	4552858	It's a ways off before the game comes out.
4553098	4559563	I would have just expected to see some more brouhaha about, because isn't the script actually by Bill Murray and them?
4559583	4561465	The script for the game is by the people who did the movie.
4561525	4564167	I'm sorry, not Bill Murray, but like Harold Ramis and the people that did the original.
4565127	4567449	I would expect more fanfare over that.
4568990	4575395	Well, like you said, I think they want to keep to the feel of the original.
4576136	4581080	I remember the original VHS covers had just the logo, which, you know...
4582502	4584343	That was 20 years ago.
4585324	4586705	That was 20 years ago.
4586765	4587725	Things were different back then.
4587766	4592329	You know what I mean?
4592549	4593169	I guess that's true.
4594150	4599834	I'll give you that, but that huge old Xbox 360 banner in white kind of ruins it.
4599874	4600415	You know what I mean?
4600435	4601495	And same thing with the PlayStation.
4601676	4603297	Well, at least the PlayStation 3 thing is black.
4603517	4604378	But you know what I mean?
4604458	4608400	Those mandatory banners they have to have on there kind of ruin that all black box.
4608441	4608921	You know what I mean?
4609938	4619445	Yeah, I think that's honestly what it is for me, is that having those other little streaks in it ruin the thing.
4619485	4621587	But anyway, it's just box art, I'll get over it.
4621667	4623368	If the game's good, you can look past it.
4623468	4631114	I don't know about you, I throw the boxes away because I have like hundreds of games and I really don't have the space for all those big-ass boxes.
4631214	4631855	So, you know, I just...
4632856	4634398	I just put them in jewel cases myself.
4634458	4635719	I don't know what you guys do.
4635779	4638121	I do leave them in the case, but the cases are all on a shelf.
4638141	4640383	They're on a DVD rack type thing that's pretty big.
4640503	4643806	So I have my Wii games on one rack, Xbox 360 on another rack.
4643866	4645608	So it works.
4647650	4649692	I don't own as many games as one might think.
4650192	4656538	I certainly don't own as many games as Jamie does, who has to have an entire wall in her house with nothing but bookshelves that have the games.
4657078	4682297	I will tell you what we do is that for the systems that we have out most often being our Xbox 360, the Wii, and the PS3 and the Saturn is out right now too I think what we do is we usually keep out the games that we're playing the most and we have a small rack that stays in the front room and we've got actually these large bookshelves in the computer room that's basically also my room because I'm on the computer in there
4683197	4685938	but we keep them with our movies, with our DVDs.
4686058	4694219	And the special edition boxes, we will every so often have them on display for the newer ones but right now they're all in the vault.
4695140	4697800	They don't make gaming organizers quite like they used to either.
4697840	4707542	I had a pretty badass one for the Atari 2600 that was like a little drawer and you'd hit the button and the drawer would pop out and then you'd hit another button and the game would kind of pop out.
4707622	4711243	I mean it was just cheap plastic with levers but the way it worked was pretty awesome.
4715412	4722775	The Atari 5200 had its little storage compartment in the back for controllers and a couple of games built into the system.
4724056	4728778	Yeah, Nintendo actually had something similar to that for the Super Nintendo, for the N64.
4728798	4729478	They had like these...
4730276	4730896	Game Houses.
4730996	4731577	I have a couple of them.
4731597	4732197	They're very nice.
4732437	4734678	I remember that.
4735099	4735599	That's true.
4735899	4737140	And then what do we get?
4737200	4743623	We get a Wii thing that was supposed to have a chip holder in it that ends up getting cancelled.
4743864	4745785	I derailed your original topic of the Ghostbusters thing.
4745805	4748566	Is there anything else you wanted to say on that or anything else you wanted to talk about tonight?
4749947	4750387	Oh, no.
4750427	4751448	That was just about it.
4751508	4752949	That was just about it, yeah.
4752989	4754890	Except that people...
4760422	4761503	Astro, that's about it.
4761523	4764144	It'll take too much to bring up something else.
4764224	4765504	I'll do that in the email next week.
4765724	4767285	Anyways, it was good to talk to you guys.
4767345	4769466	It's always best to take the high road, Rusty.
4769546	4770366	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
4771327	4772007	Have a good one, bro.
4772107	4774668	Take care.
4774688	4778350	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4778610	4780331	Oh, we gotta take at least one more call.
4780451	4781711	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4781731	4782152	Who's this?
4783192	4783792	Legend of Zaku.
4783812	4784413	Happy 420, Legend of Zaku!
4787972	4793517	I don't smoke weed for the record, I just said it to all the people that celebrate the consumption of cannabis.
4793797	4805767	You know, I gotta give you a hard time, Zaku, because you gotta admit, I don't know if it's just your microphone or the environment you call us in, if you're calling us from a tin can or something, but Tin can?
4805847	4808149	Where's the string, though?
4808410	4810111	You always sound a little bit high, but that's alright.
4810932	4813334	We're equal opportunity entertainers here at Orange Lingerie.
4813634	4815376	To what do we owe this great phone call tonight?
4816506	4844553	Um, let me see, uh, alright, basically, it's like this, uh, we, recently, as of, you know, as of last Friday, I took this girl out on, you know, went out with this girl, and we happened to stop by Dave & Buster's on our date, um, and I was just wondering, I know I don't want to dig up DDR as much, but, suppose you had, suppose that the date of yours basically never played DDR, and if she did, it was really horrible.
4845182	4849827	What songs would you even recommend in order for both of us to play?
4850128	4856475	I would say fuck it and take her over to Jumpin' Jackpot because that's where you're really going to get some pussy is Jumpin' Jackpot.
4857796	4858557	Oh, wow.
4860019	4861340	Would you agree, DarkSakura?
4862542	4863403	Huh?
4863643	4866086	What turns you on more, DDR or Jumpin' Jackpot?
4867383	4867883	D.D.R.
4883151	4888434	You know, she can't really use both of her legs, both of her feet effectively.
4888654	4893856	Two guaranteed ways to get somebody who's not into DDR, girl, boy, or not.
4894176	4899919	Two guaranteed ways to get them into it is that A, you pick easy songs, one foot songs.
4899939	4900839	Yeah, I know.
4900899	4902180	I had her on beginner.
4902320	4903321	All right, good, good.
4903341	4903921	That's where you got to start.
4903941	4904121	All right.
4904321	4905042	It was on a Supernova too.
4923432	4947792	I don't know about the rest of you guys but one thing I remember about my very first game of DDR I ever played on a DDR 1.5 mix that song Butterfly was damn catchy and that song was in my head for like three days after playing DDR I was just kind of going around going I'm your little butterfly I'm your little butterfly
4948092	4949852	and I could not get that freaking song out of my head.
4949913	4952013	So it's okay to pick catchy stuff.
4952273	4958495	But you've got to kind of know, if she's kind of a rocker girl, SmileDK is not going to be your thing.
4958835	4961876	And I don't know if DDR necessarily will be.
4961916	4964176	As I said, I was totally unprepared for the situation.
4964656	4965897	You just let her pick the song.
4966797	4967937	Well, that's the thing.
4967997	4970478	She said she didn't care.
4972479	4973679	Typical woman response.
4974558	4975700	I don't care but I will
4995197	4999719	It either means that, no, she really doesn't care, but once she hears it, she's probably not going to like it.
5000440	5006403	So I would just say, pick one, pick the other, and ask her which one sounds better.
5008364	5009144	Don't leave it open.
5009965	5013306	Yeah, I kind of, as I said, I kind of needed that advice.
5013347	5015808	You know, it was a quick spur-of-the-moment thing.
5017489	5021811	Hopefully I'll try it again if I, you know, once I go out with her again.
5022307	5030856	My buddy Amanda in chat says, reminds me, and she's an official woman too, she says, the way Rob got me to play it was, quote, Amanda, it's like a rave, but a game.
5030876	5032838	Because she was a big raver back then.
5033118	5034820	And I was like, it's like a rave, but a game.
5034840	5036721	Because there's flashing lights.
5037162	5039724	It's like cross-stitching, but a game.
5041246	5045410	Well, Zaku, best of luck to you on future dates, and we hope you get some, all right?
5045570	5045870	Good luck.
5046170	5046491	Yeah.
5046711	5046991	All right.
5048192	5048873	Take care, buddy.
5049794	5050614	Did you hear that, yeah?
5050634	5052356	It was kind of like, yeah, me too.
5054838	5056619	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
5056740	5062084	If you missed us tonight, sorry, maybe you can leave us a voicemail on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5062104	5063666	Don't forget about our contest going on, too.
5063686	5065928	We're going to check that out as we are –
5067304	5069965	Go on throughout the week and looking for contest entries.
5070325	5072186	So, more last-minute stories from Loki.
5072226	5075467	We had the story about Blitz the League and Beer Pong getting a sequel.
5075747	5076688	It's not Beer Pong.
5076708	5079009	It's a game called... But that's the part we care about.
5079029	5084731	...Game Party, and it had Beer Pong in it and Shuffleboard and some other shit.
5085511	5086352	It was a cheap-ass game.
5087212	5089433	One of those maybe shovelware games or whatever.
5089933	5107469	Anyways, real quick, the Burnout Paradise Cagney update that was going to be coming out, actually, from what I read now, it's out now, so if you pop in your copy of Burnout, you'll get your new portions of the map, which I will have to try when I get home.
5108910	5111832	And it's also going to include three more online modes.
5112273	5116377	Road Rage, Markman, and Stunt Run are going to be available online as well now.
5117037	5121441	For PS3 owners, you will also be getting the option for custom soundtracks.
5122602	5123363	So that's pretty nice.
5124964	5138676	Something kind of disappointing, that game Boom Blocks, that was supposedly going to have that head tracking kind of easter egg, well, they removed head tracking, so no reason to buy that game now.
5140558	5144082	But at the same time, you can't yell, get out of my head to this video game anymore.
5144523	5144843	I guess.
5146105	5146685	Let's see here.
5146725	5150470	Apparently, an Xbox 360 power supply was blamed for a fire.
5150770	5151371	That's kind of funny.
5152692	5154394	Xbox Live is going to be down tomorrow.
5154414	5156035	Not if it's your house that burned down.
5156075	5156755	That's not funny.
5156855	5158176	But it wasn't, so it's funny.
5159356	5169781	Xbox Live is going to be down tomorrow from 2, or I guess tonight, 2 in the morning to 10 tomorrow, Pacific time, just for some spring cleaning maintenance.
5172422	5173242	Let's see here.
5174543	5177064	Also, there's some interesting things.
5179232	5183215	You might know this guy, Ricky Gervais, I guess.
5184696	5185817	Gervais, yes.
5186358	5189760	He's the guy that's in The Office in the UK.
5190160	5198727	He's actually going to be kind of having a cameo in Grand Theft Auto 4 as part of, I guess, the city's stand-up comedy club.
5198787	5200708	He has a three-minute act that will...
5201869	5203251	I guess Loop or whatever.
5203291	5205373	They'll have different people going on stage.
5205393	5208977	But I think that's kind of cool that they have real comedians doing acts in the game.
5209798	5211861	A little bit of immersion there.
5214003	5214844	Let's see here.
5216706	5217067	Also...
5219548	5222150	Apparently Halo Wars is coming along pretty well.
5222990	5232496	There's been a few people that are part of the Xbox 360 launch team that have been caught playing Halo Wars Alpha online.
5233256	5235117	Saw you, caught you.
5235778	5237119	So that's interesting.
5240140	5240901	Let's see here.
5243768	5245430	I think I may have talked about this before.
5246391	5247472	Virtual console games.
5247593	5249515	People have found ways to pirate those now.
5250316	5251437	That's kind of interesting.
5252909	5261854	They found ways to strip away all of the encryption on them, and now a team called Blaze is releasing them out on the internet right now.
5261874	5272761	They have a few of them, and using a tool put out by yet someone else, you can actually install them to your system using the Twilight Princess hack.
5273741	5277883	So that's... I guess no one's perfect as far as security goes.
5278944	5289090	What's interesting, though, also is that the UK version of the internet channel has also been leaked out using that method as well.
5289190	5291992	So that means that WiiWare isn't immune to it either.
5293252	5293773	Uh-oh.
5294293	5295113	Uh-oh!
5295133	5295173	Um...
5299042	5301866	But if Nintendo catches you, you will get the wrath upon you.
5302126	5302367	Yes.
5303027	5305451	Apparently there's no plans for Gears of War 2.
5305711	5309777	I just want to say, that's the problem with posting these methods on the internet is that Nintendo will patch it.
5310373	5311373	Yeah.
5311713	5315174	Apparently there's not going to be a Gears of War 2 demo.
5315434	5328857	However, there have been some hints, Mark Rain, I guess, dropping some hints that Unreal Tournament 3 will feature the first Gears of War 2 content tease.
5329278	5334139	I didn't say what it is, but he says, we know some of these great mods are going to be...
5335359	5363426	or they're talking about the mods those are also going to be out available for the Xbox 360 version of Unreal Tournament 3 but people are thinking maybe that they're going to have either a demo on Unreal Tournament 3 or there's just going to be some new video footage of the game so I guess that's pretty cool and let's see here I think that's pretty much it oh
5364168	5389755	there's been a lot of homebrew stuff made for the Wii as well including now they have SNES emulators with classic controller support Genesis Sega CD emulators Master System Game Gear emulators for the Wii PC Engine emulators they have the Rin Game Boy channel for the Wii EmuLoader which will do some other emulators and Wii Paint which might be fun they need a Mario Paint for the Wii that'd be fun
5391388	5391688	That's it.
5392449	5393810	Wowies, lots of last minute news.
5393850	5398814	I was thinking going into this week after I'd been gone, I was like, oh, it's a slow gaming week, but no, lots of news.
5399455	5400115	Lots of good stuff.
5400936	5405740	All right, well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio, but not before we get everybody's final thoughts.
5405900	5407081	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
5407881	5408982	I should have ordered this earlier.
5409462	5409843	What is it?
5411064	5412105	Tickets for Phantom of the Opera.
5412705	5413165	Oh, nice.
5414406	5414887	I want to go.
5414987	5415527	It sounds like fun.
5415828	5416148	Loki, you're...
5418644	5419905	If I go, I have to take my mother.
5420245	5424868	This is going to sound so gay, but I don't care.
5424928	5430271	Going to a musical theater is something I have to do with my mom because she's such a fan.
5430311	5432273	When Mama Mia comes to town, she's like, we gotta go!
5433133	5433994	Loki, your final thought.
5434114	5439817	I will not be seeing Phantom this year since I've seen it the last two times it's been in town, and I really don't need to see it a third time.
5440437	5445060	My final thought is Sweeney Todd is going to be in town this year, and that's one I want to see.
5445160	5447301	So that's probably the one I'll buy my mom tickets for.
5447321	5447982	That might be cool.
5448022	5452644	Because if I'm going to go to musical theater, I'm going to take her to a violent play and see what she thinks of that.
5454045	5456146	I like your mom, and we need to call her on the show.
5457267	5458548	Mother's Day is just around the corner.
5459065	5463428	Rob, we need to figure out what we're going to do for our Justin TV deal.
5463928	5464208	I know.
5464669	5467531	There is a Justin TV special thingy in the works.
5468111	5469632	More OLR programming coming.
5470412	5471373	We'll talk about it this week.
5471673	5476937	I like asking questions like that because it teases it and makes the chat room go, WTF?
5477037	5477657	Must listen!
5477937	5478378	Or watch.
5478518	5478838	Or stuff.
5479326	5480167	DarkSakura.com
5499218	5503120	No, we don't ask for your cash, but we do ask for five-star iTunes reviews.
5503140	5504561	But I personally ask for their cash.
5505141	5509404	You don't always get it, though, just like Loki's not going to get that Xbox 360.
5509724	5512125	I've got $3 exactly from listeners.
5512406	5514467	I forgot to mention this as part of the last-minute story.
5514527	5517068	I did have a listener buy me dinner, so I guess that was kind of cool.
5517088	5520670	I was sent a dollar by a listener in Boston, and then I got sent a $2 bill.
5522291	5523512	and a bunch of Doctor Who fanzines.
5544745	5554809	Peekaboo is pleased to confirm that it's in talks to develop a game for the Wii that meets mainstream demand for fun and fitness benefits of pole dancing.
5555189	5557731	The company said in an email... This has to be a joke.
5557891	5568335	No, Peekaboo and its partners are focused on using Wii-friendly hardware to make aerobic pole dancing instantly accessible, just as Guitar Hero did for Rock'n'Roll.
5569745	5576250	Actually, I have to say that there are some fitness places that offer pole dancing as an exercise.
5576330	5578611	I know you think this is a joke, but this is on ABC News.
5579292	5583955	No, I fully believe it because I've seen advertisements for pole dancing classes.
5584735	5585536	That's awesome.
5586932	5587632	What can I say?
5587692	5591833	It's just more of the randomness you've come to expect and love from Orange Lounge Radio.
5591853	5593354	We'll do it all again next week.
5593954	5595494	Same time, same place.
5595594	5597275	Until then, I'm Rob.
5597355	5598055	She's Jamie.
5598115	5598735	He's Loki.
5598835	5599936	We're Orange Lounge Radio.
