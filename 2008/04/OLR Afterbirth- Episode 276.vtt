The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but were probably right anyway.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
See you next week!

00:56.000 --> 01:05.000
Tonight on the Afterbirth, Jamie has another commitment she's got to get to early in the morning.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
It's called work.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
She did will us a cage match pic, so we'll be taking care of that for her.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
But first, we have another edition of Secret Club.

01:16.000 --> 01:26.000
Here's the thing about Secret Club, and this is new for all games people, so listen up, here's the thing about Secret Club.

01:26.000 --> 01:34.000
We tell you secrets, but the thing about when you hear secrets from the first rule of Secret Club, you do not talk about Secret Club.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
Meaning that if you hear it here on this program, great, you're in the know, but you don't go posting about it to websites saying,

01:40.000 --> 01:50.000
hey, I heard it on OrangeLoungeRadio.com or I heard it on allgames.com, because we're at this point, we used to be that way where we were like, hey, you know, it makes our E penis bigger when OLR brings you the exclusive.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
But then we got the smack down that one time and it's just kind of like, you know what, fuck it, we're just going to start Secret Club and start giving out secrets.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
So, we have some secrets tonight in Secret Club.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I guess, yeah.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Alright, so what would you like to share in Secret Club tonight, Loki?

02:03.000 --> 02:13.000
Okay, well, this week, I guess, we'll talk briefly, as with every year and, you know, they got to hate us, I guess, by now for this stuff.

02:13.000 --> 02:30.000
There's stuff that always seems to come out about upcoming Konami titles and this isn't a big surprise, you know, with, you know, each year we're seeing a new release of certain games, you know, that we'd be seeing an announcement for something that hasn't quite been announced yet.

02:30.000 --> 02:44.000
Brand new DDR game coming to the PlayStation 2, although right now the title has got me a little confused, DDRX or Dance Dance Revolution X.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
I don't know what the hell that's supposed to be, but that is slated for the fall.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
DDR Extreme.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I don't remember.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
The X is for extreme.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Is it possibly in this, I was thinking about this this week ever since you posted Secret Club in the Secret Forum.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Is it their tenth release, maybe?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I don't think so.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Like, if you add all the games together from PlayStation 1, is it?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
No, because Extreme was the eighth one and then there would have been...

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Extreme 2, oh, Supernova and Supernova 2.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Oh, alright.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
So, I don't know. Maybe they just ran out of funky titles for it, I guess.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Who knows?

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
And then Hottest Part 2, of course, because, you know, the first one did pretty well, so, of course, got to release another one.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
AJ Mix says X is for tenth anniversary. That's a good thought.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Because 98 was the first year of DDR, hence the song.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Maybe.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
There you go. There you go. Props to you, AJ.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah. And then Lost in Blue coming to the Wii as well.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Lost in Blue on the Wii, so I can be bored out of my mind on the Wii too.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yes.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Right.

03:40.000 --> 03:48.000
And then totally on a different topic here, got some more news talking about the whole...

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
Remember a while back we were talking about the whole Gibson suing Activision and Harmonix for Guitar Hero?

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
Well, it's interesting because people were speculating, oh, it's probably over money or something like that.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I think this might clear it up.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
And you'd be surprised.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
This is actually... This was an email that we got from our rep at Activision, actually.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
And it says, as you may know, Activision is involved in litigation with Gibson Guitar Corporation relating to the sales of Guitar Hero games.

04:20.000 --> 04:32.000
In connection with such, Gibson has asserted to Activision that Gibson has the exclusive right to sell Guitar Hero games to music specialty stores, such as Guitar Center stores.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
Although Activision does not agree with Gibson on this issue, until this issue is resolved with Gibson,

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
Activision is requesting that its distributors refrain from selling Guitar Hero games to any music specialty store.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
So that sounds like it's over money, after all, and not some sort of patent infringement.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, I think we all kind of guessed that, to be honest.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I hate to say it that way, but I think we all kind of knew.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
But, I mean, is this really a big surprise, brand new DDR game coming out for the PlayStation 2 this year?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I mean, what, there's like one every year anyways?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I don't know.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
If that's a surprise to you, then I don't know.

05:09.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah, honestly, the new DDR game, no surprise at all, though the title's kind of interesting, but that Gibson thing is interesting.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
You know, DDRX kind of sounds like it could be a temporary name for it, but who knows.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
What I do find interesting is that there isn't anything about an Xbox 360 version.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
No, there isn't. No 360 or PlayStation 3 or anything like that yet.

05:30.000 --> 05:41.000
But, typically those games, though, if I remember last year, Supernova 2 and Hottest Party came out in September, and then the Xbox 360 one came out in November.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
So it might just not be announced yet. That may be too far ahead.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
I don't know. But I don't know how well they've done.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
All right, now with that said, I've got to find a cage match to pick.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
All right, yeah, you better look for that, because look at the cage match.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Well, thank you, everybody, for participating. Another week of secret class.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
Yes, I like sharing this stuff with you guys, but I like having a job, too, so please keep it that way.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
All right, so we'll see what happens.

06:07.000 --> 06:15.000
All right, I guess at this point we do get into the cage. I was thinking I might have one more thing for secret club tonight.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
You should play this thing that we posted. It's that separated at birth we fit balance board and aperture science turret.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Oh, yeah, I didn't want to do it because it was audio.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Let me see if I can get that. Let me go to the forums real quick.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
It was funny.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
After birth part of the show, I don't have to be as professional. Where was it here?

06:38.000 --> 06:46.000
Here's the show role in the super secret forum. Let's see, it was we fit.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, it's like the very first story in the thing that Dark Tits.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
They have two little things on there.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Kind of a genius to play the first one.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
All right, so what is this? There's apparently a great similarity between the Wii Fit balance board and aperture science turret.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Okay, here's what the turret sounds like.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
Deploying. Target lost. Are you still there? I've been waiting.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
And here's the Wii Fit balance board.

07:14.000 --> 07:24.000
Starting up. Step on. Ready.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Three, two, one.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
Measuring. Measuring. Measuring. All done.

07:35.000 --> 07:44.000
Sounds like just another stupid Wii voice to me. I don't know. I don't know if I see the similarities.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
But that's that.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Okay, I can give you one more thing for Secret Club.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Super dodge ball on virtual console at some point.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
In the not too distant future.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I wouldn't see that. Why not?

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Especially with River City Ransom just coming out.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
Super dodge ball brawlers or something like that.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
That was coming to DS at the end of next month. Makes sense.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
I'm just waiting for that Wii Fit thing in that little high pitched voice to go,

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
Measuring. Measuring. Measuring. Still measuring. God damn you're fat.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Stop eating piggy.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
Alright, let's have ourselves an OLR cage match.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
The way the cage match works, three songs go in and do battle and the winning song,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
well it doesn't go into rotation anymore because it's not our station,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
but it does win the praise and admiration of all of our listeners

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
and some type of consolation prize we'll come up with in the future.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Meanwhile, let's discuss the three songs doing battle tonight.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
It's last week's winner versus two new people, or songs I should say, brought in from OLR hosts.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Last week in the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match, believe it or not, I won.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
And I won with a little band called Spray who was famous for the song I Am Gothic in DDR years ago.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
They did a cover of the song Run With Us.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
It was the theme song to the Raccoons, but they made it sound like initial, or not initial D,

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Wan Gen Midnight Maximum Tune.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
Like imagine mixing your favorite 80s cartoon, even though the Raccoons probably top nobody's list,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
with Wan Gen Midnight Maximum Tune, and you get this song.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
So it's all kinds of awesome and the chatroom voted it as their favorite too.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
It's song number one tonight. It's Spray with Run With Us.

09:29.000 --> 09:53.000
And remember, you only get a clip because it did win last week.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
And you sing it in a quick sense, and it turns you down.

10:05.000 --> 10:12.000
In the field of coming under, through your arms.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
We got done with us.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
We got everything you need.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Run with us.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
We are free.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Come with us.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
I see passion in your eyes.

10:33.000 --> 10:49.000
Come with us.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
That was song number one.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
I'm getting ahead of myself.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
The song is called Run With Us, the Michael Trend filled radio edit, technically that is,

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
but it's song number one on the single, which is available on iTunes.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
It's awesome.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
The Raccoons, Run With Us by Spray.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
All right, song number two tonight is brought to you by Jamie.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Even though she's not here and sadly can't take your FUs either,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
so off the table into next week.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
She thought, gee, I had so much luck with mindless self-indulgence the other week.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I think I'll try it again and see if lightning strikes twice.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
So she brings this song to you guys tonight.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
It's called Shut Me Up, which we've managed to do tonight by her leaving early.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Shut Me Up by Mindless Self-Indulgence.

11:28.000 --> 11:52.000
Here it is, song number two tonight.

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
I can't wait for you to fuck me up in a minute, minute, in a fucking minute.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
I can't wait for you to fuck me up in a minute, minute, in a second.

12:04.000 --> 12:24.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

12:24.000 --> 12:37.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

12:37.000 --> 12:58.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

12:58.000 --> 13:22.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

13:22.000 --> 13:42.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

13:42.000 --> 14:02.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

14:02.000 --> 14:25.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

14:25.000 --> 14:45.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

14:45.000 --> 15:05.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

15:05.000 --> 15:25.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

15:25.000 --> 15:34.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

15:34.000 --> 15:54.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

15:54.000 --> 16:14.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

16:14.000 --> 16:34.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

16:34.000 --> 16:54.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

16:54.000 --> 17:14.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

17:14.000 --> 17:34.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

17:34.000 --> 17:54.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

17:54.000 --> 18:14.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

18:14.000 --> 18:34.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

18:34.000 --> 19:02.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

19:02.000 --> 19:22.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

19:22.000 --> 19:42.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

19:42.000 --> 20:02.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

20:12.000 --> 20:36.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

20:36.000 --> 20:56.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

20:56.000 --> 21:16.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

21:16.000 --> 21:36.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

21:36.000 --> 21:56.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

21:56.000 --> 22:16.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

22:16.000 --> 22:36.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

22:36.000 --> 22:56.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

22:56.000 --> 23:16.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

23:16.000 --> 23:36.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

23:36.000 --> 23:56.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

23:56.000 --> 24:16.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

24:16.000 --> 24:36.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

24:36.000 --> 24:56.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

24:56.000 --> 25:16.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

25:16.000 --> 25:36.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

25:36.000 --> 25:56.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

25:56.000 --> 26:16.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

26:16.000 --> 26:36.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

26:36.000 --> 26:56.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

26:56.000 --> 27:16.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

27:16.000 --> 27:36.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

27:36.000 --> 27:56.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

27:56.000 --> 28:16.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

28:16.000 --> 28:36.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

28:36.000 --> 28:56.000
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.

28:56.000 --> 29:16.000
